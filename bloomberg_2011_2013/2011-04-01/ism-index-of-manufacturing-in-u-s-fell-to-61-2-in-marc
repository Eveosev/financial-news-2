Manufacturing in the U.S. expanded
in March at close to the fastest pace in almost seven years,
reinforcing signs the industry will propel growth in the world’s
largest economy.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index
was little changed at 61.2, after February’s 61.4 reading that
was the highest since May 2004, the Tempe, Arizona-based group’s
report showed today. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  Companies like  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  United Technologies
Corp. (UTX)  are benefiting as production, fueled by inventory
rebuilding at the start of the recovery, gets an added boost
from rising demand in the U.S. and overseas. The strength in
manufacturing is also generating job gains, a necessary
ingredient to a sustained expansion.  “Manufacturing is doing very well,” said  Nigel Gault ,
chief U.S. economist at IHS Global Insight Inc. in Lexington,
 Massachusetts . “It’s the leading sector in the economy.”  Stocks extended gains after the figures, with the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index rising 0.7 percent to 1,334.69 at 10:47 a.m.
in  New York . Treasuries were little changed from late yesterday,
with the yield on the benchmark 10-year note at 3.47 percent.  The median forecast of 79 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was 61.1. Estimates ranged from 59 to 63.  A gauge of factories in the euro region dropped to 57.5
last month from February’s 59, London-based Markit Economics
said. Manufacturing in  China ,  India  and Russia also expanded.  China Manufacturing  China’s manufacturing growth accelerated for the first time
in four months with the index rising to 53.4 from 52.2, while
India’s manufacturing grew for a 24th straight month and the
index remained at 57.9. Russia’s factory output gauge increased
to 55.6, the highest in almost five years, from 55.2.  Earlier, the Labor Department reported that the  U.S.
economy  added 216,000 jobs in March, while the  unemployment rate 
declined to 8.8 percent, signs the labor-market recovery is
gathering speed.  The ISM’s production index increased to 69, the highest
since January 2004, from 66.3. The new orders measure fell to
63.3 from 68, and the gauge of export orders decreased to 56
from 62.5.  The employment gauge slipped to 63 from 64.5 in the prior
month.  The index of prices paid jumped to 85, the highest since
July 2008, from 82. A measure of supplier deliveries increased
to a one-year high of 63.1 in March, indicating longer lead
times.  Order Backlogs  The measure of orders waiting to be filled fell to 52.5
from 59. The inventory index eased to 47.4 from 48.8, while a
gauge of customer stockpiles was little changed at 39.5 from 40.
A figure lower than 50 means manufacturers are reducing
stockpiles.  Recent regional factory reports underscore the resilience
of the manufacturing industry, which accounts for about 11
percent of the economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s index indicated factories expanded in March at
the fastest pace since 1984, while the New York Fed’s measure
rose to a nine-month high.  United Technologies, the maker of Pratt & Whitney jet-
engines and Otis elevators, is among companies benefiting from
growth in the so-called BRIC countries that include Brazil,
 Russia , India and China. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company
in March boosted the low end of its 2011 earnings forecast amid
improving markets across its divisions.  Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar, the world’s largest
maker of construction equipment, is seeing a “slow, steady
increase” in demand in  North America , Chief Executive Officer
 Doug Oberhelman  said at an industry conference on March 23.
“Business is booming outside the U.S.,” Oberhelman said.  Auto dealers are also seeing improved demand. Car sales in
February rose to a 13.38 million unit pace, the highest since
the government’s cash-for-clunkers program in August 2009,
according to industry data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
