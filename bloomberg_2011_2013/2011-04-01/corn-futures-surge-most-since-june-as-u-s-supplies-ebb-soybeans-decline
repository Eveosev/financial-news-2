Corn futures surged the most in nine
months after inventories slumped to a four-year low in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest exporter. Soybeans fell on rising production
in  South America .  Corn stockpiles on March 1 declined 15 percent from a year
earlier as demand for animal feed, fuel and food climbed, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday. In the week ended
March 24, U.S.  exports  for delivery before Aug. 31 doubled to
1.91 million metric tons from a week earlier. Futures jumped the
most allowed by the  Chicago  Board of Trade for the second
straight day.  “Declining U.S. grain supply was a surprise, and the
market is adjusting to a tightening situation,” said Chad Henderson, a market analyst for Prime Agricultural Consultants
Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin . “Export demand improved.”  Corn futures for May delivery gained 42.75 cents, or 6.2
percent, to $7.36 a bushel at 1:15 p.m., the biggest gain since
June 30. Earlier, the price rose by the exchange maximum of 45
cents. Yesterday, the limit was 30 cents.  The commodity, up 6.7 percent this week, has more than
doubled in the past year on lower global output and rising
demand for grain-based ethanol.  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 16.5 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $13.9375 a bushel, snapping a three-day rally. The
most-active contract gained 2.6 percent this week and has
climbed 48 percent in the past year on record Chinese demand for
U.S. supplies.  Prices also fell on speculation that declining margins to
produce  animal feed  and cooking oil from soybeans may reduce
imports by  China , the biggest consumer, Henderson said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
