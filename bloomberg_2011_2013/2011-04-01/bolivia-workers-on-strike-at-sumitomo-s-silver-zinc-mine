Sumitomo Corp.’s silver, zinc and
lead mine in  Bolivia  has been halted for at least a week by a
strike, Bolivia’s mining ministry said.  Negotiations between workers and Sumitomo Corp.’s
subsidiary San Cristobal have not begun, a government official,
who can’t be named because of ministry policy, said today at the
mining ministry in La Paz. Workers at the San Cristobal mine,
where production is shut by the strike, are demanding better
health care.  San Cristobal is Bolivia’s largest mine. Last year it
contributed $100 million in royalties and taxes to the Bolivian
state, Vice Minister of Mining Hector Cordova has said.  Sumitomo’s San Cristobal, in southwestern Bolivia’s
mineral-rich region of Potosi, is the world’s third-largest
silver mine and the sixth-biggest zinc mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
