Crude oil climbed to a 30-month high
in  New York  as the U.S. added more jobs than forecast, signaling
increased demand, and as fighting intensified in Libya.  Oil rose 1.1 percent after the Labor Department said
payrolls advanced by 216,000 workers in March. Economists
projected a 190,000 gain, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Libyan rebels have been in retreat for three days as Muammar Qaddafi’s troops regained the initiative after almost two weeks
of allied airstrikes.  “The better-than-expected employment numbers are another
supportive factor for the market,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker
with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York. “There’s
nothing to stop this uptrend, $110 oil is on its way.”  Crude oil for May delivery rose $1.22 to $107.94 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement
since Sept. 25, 2008. Oil is up 2.4 percent for the week and 27
percent from a year ago. Futures surged 17 percent from January
through March, the biggest quarterly gain since 2009.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 4.36 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to end the session at $3.1513 a gallon in New York, the highest
settlement price July 21, 2008.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 1.3 cents to $3.619 a gallon yesterday, the highest
level since Sept. 30, 2008, the AAA said on its  website .  The U.S. jobless rate dropped to 8.8 percent in March from
8.9 percent the prior month, the fourth straight decrease, the
Labor Department said today in  Washington . The  unemployment rate 
was projected to hold at 8.9 percent, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Almost Perfect’  “The employment numbers are almost perfect for the
market,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis . “You’re getting
a steady improvement, but not so fast that it spurs wage growth
and inflation. This signals that more people will be out there
buying things, which is just phenomenal for the stock market.”  The U.S. employment numbers also bolstered the stock
market. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 56.99 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 12,376.72. The Standard & Poor’s 500 advanced
0.5 percent to 1,332.41.  “Oil is primarily correlated with the equity markets right
now,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “The equity markets are being looked
at as a measure of economic growth and a barometer of petroleum
demand.”  The strife in Libya, holder of  Africa ’s largest oil
reserves, is the bloodiest in a wave of uprisings that has
toppled the leaders of Tunisia and  Egypt  and spread to Algeria,
 Bahrain ,  Iran , Oman, Syria and Yemen.  Cease-Fire Call  Libyan rebels called for a cease-fire as forces loyal to
Qaddafi drove them back for a third day after sandstorms and
clouds hindered NATO air strikes and the U.S. said it’s
withdrawing all warplanes. U.S. leaders said they’re unwilling
to start providing arms and training for rebels.  “The market is tracking the progress, or lack thereof, of
the rebels in  Libya ,” O’Grady said. “It probably doesn’t make
any difference because whoever is in control, it will take quite
a while before they can turn on the oil flow again.”  Libyan exports may be halted for “many months” because of
sanctions and damage to facilities, the  International Energy
Agency  said on March 15.  Brent oil for May settlement climbed $1.34, or 1.1 percent,
to end the session at $118.70 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest closing price since
Aug. 21, 2008.  Brent Premium  The European benchmark traded at a $10.76 premium over U.S
futures. The difference between front-month contracts in  London 
and New York surged to a record $19.54 on Feb. 21 as unrest
spread in the Middle East and as supplies rose at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the delivery point for West Texas Intermediate, the
U.S. benchmark grade. The gap averaged 76 cents last year.  Brent may hit $130 a barrel this quarter if the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries fails to act in
time to raise production and make up for supply disruptions
caused by Middle East unrest, according to analysts at JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  “As long as key economies remain on track, and given the
tensions still manifest on the supply side, we remain positive
on near-term price outlook” with Brent “possibly spiking
toward $130 a barrel if OPEC fails to act in time and raise
production,” analysts led by New York-based Lawrence Eagles
said today in a note to clients.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 499,303
contracts as of 3:32 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 546,886
contracts yesterday, 33 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.55 million contracts, the
highest level since March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
