Copper fell, heading for its first
weekly drop in three on concern that  China , the top metals user,
will step up monetary tightening after data showed that
manufacturing accelerated for the first time in four months.  Three-month-delivery copper on the  London  Metal Exchange
fell as much as 0.4 percent to $9,389 a metric ton, and traded
at $9,404 at 1:58 p.m. in  Singapore . All six LME base metals
fell, led by a 0.9 percent drop in nickel.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 53.4 in March,
compared with 52.2 in February and a median forecast of 54 in a
Bloomberg News survey, easing concern that monetary tightening
may hamper growth. A reading of more than 50 indicates
expansion.  “The data is a double-edged sword,” Yan Lei, an analyst
at Guoyuan Securities Co., said from  Shanghai . “It shows the
economy is still growing and at the same time it reminds
investors about China’s tightening policy. It’s a good excuse to
take some money off the table ahead of the holidays.” China’s
markets are closed April 4 and 5 for the Qingming Festival.  Copper futures on the Comex in  New York  dropped 0.7 percent
to $4.2775 a pound, while the metal for June delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.2 percent to 70,500 yuan
($10,770) a ton.  The central bank has boosted banks’ reserve-requirement
ratio eight times and raised interest rates three times since
the start of 2010 to cool the economy and tame inflation. The
People’s Bank of China may raise  interest rates  again early this
month, Citigroup Inc. said.  China is “not even close” to being in the middle of a
“massive infrastructure and investment build,” London Metal
Exchange Chief Executive Officer Martin Abbott said in an
interview yesterday. The bourse’s business will be “good” this
year with China still in expansion, he said.  “China may grow at a slower pace but there will still be
growth and this will keep demand for metals robust,” Zhang Yan,
a trader at Jin Yuan Futures Co., said from Shanghai.  Nickel in London dropped 1.3 percent to $25,750 per ton,
zinc lost 1 percent to $2,338.25 a ton and aluminum declined 0.6
percent to $2,631 a ton. Tin fell 1.9 percent to $31,210 a ton
and lead lost 0.4 percent to $2,685 a ton.  -- Editors:  Matthew Oakley , Jarrett Banks  To contact the reporter on this story:
