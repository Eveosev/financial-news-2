The Turkish lira gained for a fourth
day and stocks rallied to a six-week high as data from the U.S.
and  China , the world’s biggest economies, boosted confidence in
the global economy and investors’ appetite for risk.  The lira appreciated 0.5 percent to 1.53765 per dollar at
5:38 p.m. in Istanbul, giving it a 1.2 percent gain this week.
The  ISE National 100 index (XU100)  jumped 2 percent to 65,714.4 at the
5:30 p.m. close, its highest since Feb. 18, for a 2.3 percent
climb in the past five day, a fourth week of increases.  The  U.S. economy  added more jobs than forecast in March and
the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly declined to a two-year low of
8.8 percent, while China’s manufacturing growth accelerated for
the first time in four months, reports today showed. The global
data strengthened the export outlook for  Turkey , which reported
yesterday that its economy expanded 9.2 percent in the fourth
quarter, faster that the 7.4 percent median estimate analysts.  “The growth figure is sharpening appetite and foreign funds
are flowing into the Istanbul stock market,” Tufan Comert, a
strategist at Garanti Securities in Istanbul, said in e-mailed
comments.  Foreign investors raised their holdings of Turkish equities
for a third week in the five days ended March 25 by a net $2.1
billion and increased bond holdings by 1.25 billion, a fourth
week in which they added to their holdings, according to central
bank data published yesterday.  Tighter liquidity resulting from increases in bank  reserve
requirements  is supporting the lira, Comert said. The central
bank on March 23 raised reserve requirements to 15 percent for
lira deposits of less than one month. The measure will drain
19.1 billion liras ($12.2 billion) of liquidity from the market,
the central bank said at the time.  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) , Turkey’s second-biggest group
of companies, added 3.9 percent to 7.46 liras or 28 kurus, after
the company said today profit last year rose to 1.66 billion
liras from 1.26 billion liras in 2009, exceeding estimates.  Yields on two-year benchmark bonds closed at 9.01 percent,
the same as yesterday and the end of last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
