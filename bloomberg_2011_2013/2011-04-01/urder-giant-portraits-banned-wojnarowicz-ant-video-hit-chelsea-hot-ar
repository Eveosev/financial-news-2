Ethanol futures advanced a fifth day
in  Chicago  on concern that wet weather in the Midwest will delay
corn seeding and raise costs for distilling the grain into the
gasoline additive.  Ethanol moved with corn, which rose on the Chicago Board of
Trade as wet weather from  Ohio  to  North Dakota  delayed spring
seeding, threatening to erode yields. Corn is the primary
feedstock for ethanol in the U.S.  “As we get closer to summer this becomes more and more of
a weather market,” said Jim Damask, a manager at
BiofuelsConnect, a Heathrow, Florida-based alternative energy
broker. “Rain, drought, flooding, any weather event and corn is
going to react.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery rose 6.4 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $2.648 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
gain was the largest in two weeks.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago increased 4.5
cents, or 1.8 percent, to $2.605 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the biofuel slid 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.74, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol output in the U.S. increased 4.4 percent to 900,000
barrels a day last week, according to the Energy Department.
Stockpiles declined 27,000 barrels to 20.4 million, the
department said in a report released in  Washington .  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
advanced 4.3 percent to 5.08 million barrels a day. Refiners
receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol blended
into the motor fuel.  Ethanol on the West Coast rose 3 cents to $2.775 a gallon
while the fuel jumped 4 cents in  New York  to $2.705.  Corn futures for July delivery gained 29.5 cents, or 4.1
percent, to $7.498 a bushel in Chicago. Earlier, the price rose
the 30-cent limit to $7.5025, the highest for a most-active
contract since May 2.  Corn prices have more than doubled in the past year on
tightening global supplies and rising demand from ethanol
producers and livestock farmers. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
