Soccer’s international and European
governing bodies suspended Bosnia and Herzogovina from all
competitions after the country didn’t pass rules required to
stay eligible.  Bosnia and Herzegovina had to approve the rules by
yesterday, but only 22 of 54 delegates voted for the statutes
during a March 29 meeting, FIFA said. The country’s governing
body “has lost all of its membership rights with immediate
effect and until further notice,” FIFA said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The team is in fourth place in Group D in the qualifying
for the 2012 European Championships, with 7 points.  France  leads
the group with 12, followed by Belarus and Albania on 8 each.
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s next game in the competition is in
June.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
