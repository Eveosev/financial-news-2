Crude oil , gasoline and heating oil
extended their gains to the highest levels since 2008 as the
U.S. added more jobs than forecast, signaling increased demand,
and as fighting intensified in Libya, adding to concern that
supplies will tighten. Ethanol also extended a 31-month high.  Crude Oil  Crude oil for May delivery rose $1.22, or 1.1 percent, to
$107.94 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, finishing
the week with a gain of 2.4 percent. Oil advanced above $107 for
the first time since 2008 as the Labor Department said payrolls
rose by 216,000 workers in March.  “The better-than-expected employment numbers are another
supportive factor for the market,” said  Tom Bentz , a broker
with BNP Paribas Commodity Futures in New York. “There’s
nothing to stop this uptrend, $110 oil is on its way.”  Gasoline  Gasoline for May delivery rose 4.36 cents, or 1.4 percent,
to $3.1513 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
highest settlement since July 2008.  Heating Oil  Heating oil for May delivery added 2.2 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $3.1345 a gallon on the exchange, the highest
settlement since August 2008.  Ethanol  Denatured ethanol for April delivery soared 2.4 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $2.68 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, a
day after the Agriculture Department said corn inventories at
the beginning of March slipped to 6.52 billion bushels. The
price was the highest settlement since July 2008. Ethanol has
increased 76 percent in the past year.  Refineries and Transport  Sunoco Inc. (SUN)  won’t return units to service at its Marcus
Hook refinery in Pennsylvania until it can repair and restart a
fluid catalytic cracker, a person familiar with refinery
operations said. Sunoco hopes to have the catalytic cracker
restarted on April 5, said the person.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  completed maintenance on a hydrocracker,
a sat gas plant and a hydrogen unit at its refinery in Torrance,
California, and the plant is back to normal operations, said
Aarti Ramachandran, a spokeswoman at the refinery.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  has started planned work on a
hydrocracker at its McKee refinery in Texas, Bill Day, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
