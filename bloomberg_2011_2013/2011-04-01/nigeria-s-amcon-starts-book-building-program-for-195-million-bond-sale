Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria , a
state-owned company set up to buy bad debts from banks, started
a process today to gauge investor interest for the sale of 30
billion naira ($195 million) in bonds, Executive Director Foluke
Dosumu said.  The bonds are the part of Amcon’s Series 1 debt program of
1.7 trillion naira to be issued on April 6, Dosumu said at a
presentation to investors today in Lagos, the commercial
capital. The book building is for “price discovery” for the
entire series and will be concluded on April 5, he said.  The 30 billion naira tranche is the only portion of the
Series 1 bonds that is open to the public, Mustapha Chike-Obi,
Amcon’s managing director, said today. The amount “is large
enough to determine where the price of the bonds should be
today,” he said.  Amcon shelf-registered a 3 trillion-naira debt series with
Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory
authorities, Dosumu said. The company bought non-performing
loans as part of a program to clear the country’s lenders of bad
debts. The  Central Bank of Nigeria  in 2009 bailed out the
banking industry with 620 billion naira and fired eight bank
chief executive officers after a debt crisis threatened it with
collapse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
