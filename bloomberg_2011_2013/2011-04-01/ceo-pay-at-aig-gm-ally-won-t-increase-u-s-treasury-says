Chief executive officers at  American
International Group Inc. (AIG) ,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and Ally Financial
Inc. won’t receive pay increases this year, the  U.S. Treasury 
Department said.  Cash pay for the three CEOs was frozen at 2010 levels, the
Treasury said in a statement today. Compensation for the top 25
executives at the bailed-out companies must be approved by
Patricia Geoghegan, the Obama administration’s acting special
master for executive compensation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
