KKR & Co. partner John Pfeffer, who
headed the private equity firm’s investments in the European
retail industry, stepped down to set up his own company.  Pfeffer will leave today and his responsibilities will be
assumed by Brian Carroll, head of the consumer team in  Europe ,
KKR spokesman Ludo Bammens said by telephone.  “After a fruitful, fulfilling and fun 11 years at KKR, I
have decided to return to my entrepreneurial roots and create
and build my own businesses outside the firm,” Pfeffer said in
an e-mail yesterday. He didn’t return calls for comment today.  Pfeffer led acquisitions including that of U.K. retailer
Pets at Home Ltd. from Bridgepoint Capital Ltd. for 955 million
pounds ($1.5 billion) in January 2010, one of the first LBOs in
Europe since the credit crisis. He also worked on KKR’s
investment in Turkish shipping company UN Ro-Ro Isletmeleri AS
and retailer Toys “R” Us.  Pfeffer’s departure follows that of Oliver Haarmann, head
of the firm’s European telecommunications team, about a year
ago. Haarmann has since started investment firm Searchlight
Capital Partners.  KKR’s two most recent European funds are paring their
losses from the crisis. The $5.8 billion fund raised in 2005 is
posting a 7 percent loss, while the $5.96 billion 2008 pool is
valued slightly above par, Bammens said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
