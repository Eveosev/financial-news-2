Malaysia’s ringgit traded near the
strongest level in more than 13 years after a central bank
report yesterday showed foreign funds raised their holdings in
local-currency debt to a record.  The ringgit completed its eighth quarterly advance
yesterday after global funds raised their ownership of Malaysian
bonds for a 16th consecutive month through February, according
to data published by the central bank. A report showed
manufacturing in  China  expanded last month and economists
surveyed by Bloomberg predicted further job gains in the U.S.
before data due later today. Government bonds fell.  “The bond inflows suggest risk appetite among foreign
investors is still strong,” said Akira Banno, a treasury
adviser at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .
“The authorities are trying to stabilize the market but there
is still room for the ringgit to appreciate as I expect a better
U.S. job report today.”  The ringgit traded at 3.0255 per dollar as of 4:40 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was
little changed from a week ago. It has strengthened 1.3 percent
this year and reached 3.0210 on March 25, the strongest level
since October 1997.  Overseas investors held 137.9 billion ringgit ($45.6
billion) of ringgit-denominated  debt  at the end of February, up
6.7 percent from January and 91 percent from a year earlier,
 Bank Negara  said. The holdings included a record 79.4 billion
ringgit of  government bonds .  China’s manufacturing growth accelerated last month, with
the purchasing managers’ index rising to 53.4 from 52.2 in
February, the Beijing-based National Bureau of Statistics and
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today. U.S.
employers probably added 190,000 jobs in March versus 192,000 in
February, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  Bond Auctions  Ten-year notes fell for a second week, pushing yields to
the highest level in two months as concern about debt supply and
faster inflation eroded demand for debt.  The yield on the 4.16 percent note maturing in July 2021
climbed 6 basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.12
percent, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price dropped 0.45, or
4.5 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 100.35.  The government is scheduled to sell 10- and 15-year notes
this month via auctions and private sales this month, according
to its sale calendar. It sold 24.5 billion ringgit of bonds last
quarter, up 29 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
