Citigroup Inc. (C)  Chief Executive
Officer  Vikram Pandit  said the U.S. must reduce its trade
deficit by boosting production and exports.  “We lack a sound mix of imports and exports,” Pandit said
today at an Export-Import Bank conference in Washington.  “The
American worker suffers the most from that imbalance.”  As a result “it’s no wonder” that “support for trade
began to drop” in the past few years, he said. Pandit said the
best way to regain public confidence is to create free-trade
initiatives, which he said would boost exports.  Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. bank, would help lead a
campaign to win congressional approval for Russia’s entry into
the World Trade Organization, he said. The New York-based bank
supports the pending free-trade agreements with  South Korea ,
Panama and Colombia, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
