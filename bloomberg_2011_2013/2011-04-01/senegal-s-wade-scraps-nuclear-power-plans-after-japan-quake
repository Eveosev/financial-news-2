Senegal canceled plans to build what
would have been the first African nuclear power plant outside of
 South Africa , President Abdoulaye Wade told a cabinet meeting
yesterday.  The West African nation had ordered nuclear equipment from
a Russian company, Wade said in an e-mailed statement, without
identifying the company.  In the aftermath of a March 11 earthquake in  Japan , which
has placed the Pacific nation’s nuclear reactors at risk, Wade
canceled that order, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
