Central banks around the world are
forbidden from underwriting debt and doing so may spur inflation
and exacerbate government borrowing costs, said Sayuri Shirai,
the Bank of  Japan ’s newest board member.  “The  European Central Bank  and other central banks are
explicitly prohibited from underwriting -- that’s the global
consensus,” Shirai said at an inaugural press conference in
 Tokyo  today. “Once the step is adopted, there may not be
problems at first but it could spiral out of control
eventually.”  Some lawmakers in both the ruling and opposition parties
have indicated they want the central bank to underwrite debt to
finance rebuilding after a record earthquake that killed more
than 11,000 people. Remarks by Shirai, who begins her five-year
term today, echoed reluctance voiced by BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa about directly purchasing bonds.  Top government officials signaled they won’t push for the
central bank to fund reconstruction efforts. Economic and Fiscal
Policy Minister Kaoru Yosano today said he would “never allow”
the bank to underwrite debt, which is prohibited by law, because
it could erode the bank’s credibility. Finance Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda  said reports that the government may ask the BOJ
to assume debt are “absolutely” groundless and the plan is not
being considered by the officials.  To contact the reporters on this story:
