Norwegian manufacturing expanded for
a 12th month in March as economic recoveries for key trading
partners such as  Sweden  boosted exports.  A seasonally adjusted index based on responses from
purchasing managers fell to 57.7 from 58.6 in February, Fokus
Bank said today in a statement. It was forecast to be at 58.5,
according to the median estimate in a survey of eight analysts.
A reading above 50 signals growth.  A rebound in exports will help the Nordic economy grow 3.25
percent this year, up from 2.2 percent last year, according the
central bank. Exports will surge 6.25 percent as countries such
as Sweden and  Germany  purchase more Norwegian goods, the bank
estimates.  An industrial recovery is accompanied by  Europe ’s lowest
unemployment rate, rising household spending and the highest
 consumer confidence  since 2007. Policy makers this year brought
forward potential rate increases on concern the economy of the
world’s seventh-largest oil exporter may be overheating.  Norges Bank said last month it may raise its rate in May or
June, after keeping it unchanged at 2 percent since May. Policy
makers next meet on May 12 to decide on borrowing costs.  The sub-index measuring orders fell to 57.3 from a revised
61.2, while the gauge for production increased to 60.4 from 60
in February, Fokus Bank said.  Norway’s PMI Index was started by Fokus Bank in 2004 in
cooperation with the Association for Purchasing and Logistics.
Fokus Bank is owned by Danske Bank A/S, Denmark’s biggest bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
