Lloyd C. Blankfein,  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) ’s chairman and chief executive officer, received $19
million in compensation for 2010, including his first cash bonus
in three years, almost double last year’s reward.  The total includes a $5.4 million cash payment, $12.6
million in restricted stock, $600,000 salary and about $464,000
in other benefits, according to the New York-based firm’s proxy
statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
today. He got $9.8 million a year earlier, which included $9
million in restricted stock, a $600,000 salary, and about
$262,000 in other compensation.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
boosted Blankfein’s compensation even though earnings dropped 38
percent and the stock price was little changed from a year
earlier. Blankfein’s pay remained below 2007, when he received a
record-setting $67.9 million bonus.  Blankfein, 56, and six other senior officers at Goldman
Sachs were paid no bonuses for 2008. All 30 members of the
firm’s management committee received only restricted stock for
their 2009 bonuses and four of them -- Chief Financial Officer
David A. Viniar, 55, President and Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, and Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans, 53, and John S. Weinberg, 54 -- received the same $9 million award as Blankfein.  Matching Bonuses  For 2010, Goldman Sachs once again matched all of those
four executives’ bonuses to Blankfein’s $12.6 million in
restricted stock and $5.4 million in cash. All four also
received a $600,000 salary in 2010.  The SEC requires that the company’s proxy disclose how much
compensation executives received during the fiscal year. Under
that methodology, which includes awards received during 2010 for
performance in prior years, Blankfein received a total of $14.1
million in compensation.  The company’s board of directors has unanimously
recommended that the firm give shareholders a non-binding
advisory vote on executive compensation every year. A vote is
also being held on the compensation disclosed in this year’s
proxy.  The firm will hold its annual shareholder meeting at 9:30
a.m. on May 6 at the company’s office in  Jersey City ,  New
Jersey , the proxy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
