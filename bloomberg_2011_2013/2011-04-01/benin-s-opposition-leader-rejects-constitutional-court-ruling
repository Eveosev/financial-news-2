Benin’s main opposition leader,
Adrien Houngbedji, rejected a Constitutional Court ruling that
President Thomas Boni Yayi won the March 13 election, and
proclaimed himself president.  “The opposition won this election,” Houngbedji told a
press conference late yesterday in the commercial capital,
Cotonou. “The president who was freely and regularly elected
without fraud was the opposition candidate.”  About 500 people protested through the capital, Porto Novo,
yesterday in support of Houngbedji, the state-owned Office de
Radiodiffusion et Television reported. Police dispersed the
crowd and arrested 10 demonstrators, the Cotonou-based
broadcaster reported, citing police commander Mohamed Mouftaou
Prince Eledji.  Two other opposition candidates, Abdoulaye Bio Tchane and
Marie-Elise Gbedo, accepted the Constitutional Court’s ruling,
which gave Boni Yayi 53 percent of the vote and Houngbedji 36
percent, ORTB reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
