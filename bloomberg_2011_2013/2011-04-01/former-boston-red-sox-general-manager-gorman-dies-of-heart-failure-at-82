Lou Gorman, general manager of three
 Boston  Red Sox division-winning teams from 1984 to 1993,  died
of congestive heart failure at the age of 82.  Gorman passed away this morning, the Red Sox said in an e-
mailed statement.  Gorman’s Red Sox won the American League East division
title in 1986, 1988 and 1990. The 1986 team reached the  World
Series , the franchise’s third in 40 years, before losing to the
 New York Mets  in seven games.  “Lou Gorman was a giant in our industry,” current Red Sox
general manager Theo Epstein said in the statement. “We’ll
dearly miss this good, humble man who leaves an unmistakable
legacy on the  Boston Red Sox  and  Major League Baseball .”  Gorman inherited a team in 1984 that had pitcher Roger Clemens and third baseman Wade Boggs and built around the two
future All-Stars. The team won 80 or more games in eight of his
10 seasons. He is also responsible for the Red Sox trading away
prospects Jeff Bagwell and Curt Schilling, who combined for 10
All-Star selections after leaving Boston.  Gorman was also the first general manager of the Seattle
Mariners, leading the club through its 1977 expansion into the
American League. Before joining the Red Sox he also worked with
the Mets, Baltimore Orioles, and Kansas City Royals.  He is survived by his wife, Mary Lou.  To contact the reporter on this story:
