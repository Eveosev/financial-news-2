Governor  Chris Christie  wants to
change the school-funding formula in New Jersey to make it
equitable for all districts.  A new financing system will be outlined within the next
year, the Republican governor said today at a public meeting in
Monroe Township. Christie, 48, has been sued by advocates for
inner-city schools who contend his $1.7 billion in education
cuts are unconstitutional and must be restored.  The forthcoming financing plan will be fairer to middle-
class taxpayers, Christie said. Several residents at the Monroe
meeting complained that the current funding formula has hurt the
community. Local property taxes provide the bulk of the money
spent on schools in most districts.  “You’re getting hosed,” Christie said. “The school-
funding formula is, in my mind, ridiculous.”  New Jersey ’s almost 600  school districts  spent $25 billion
last year, including $10 billion in state aid and $15 billion
from local property levies, Christie said. About 60 percent of
the state money went to 31 districts with larger populations of
lower-income residents, he said.  Those disadvantaged districts receive more than $17,000 for
each student in aid and the remainder get $2,900 a year,
Christie said. The governor said his new financing system will
aim to narrow the  funding gap  between districts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
