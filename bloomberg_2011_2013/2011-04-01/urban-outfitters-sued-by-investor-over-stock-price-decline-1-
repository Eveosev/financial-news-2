Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN) , a clothing
retailer that uses brands including  Anthropologie , was sued by a
shareholder contending company officials misled investors before
the stock declined.  The company wrongly led shareholders to believe business
was going well until March 7, when it reported earnings of 13
percent less than analysts had suggested, Edward Koller III
claims in a lawsuit filed yesterday in federal court in
Philadelphia. Shares fell 17 percent the next day, he said.  Between November and March, the company “engaged in a
scheme to deceive the market and a course of conduct that
artificially inflated Urban Outfitters’s stock price,” Koller’s
 lawyers  allege in court papers.  Stock in the Philadelphia-based company, with $2.27 billion
in revenue last fiscal year, fell the most in more than two
years after it reported shrinking profit margins March 8.  Oona McCullough, investor-relations director for the
company, didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  Koller, with 200 shares, asks for a  jury trial  and
unspecified damages for a common class of stockholders,
according to court papers.  Urban Outfitters rose 45 cents to $30.28 at 12:21 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have fallen
20 percent in the past year, according to Bloomberg Data.  The case is Edward Koller III v. Urban Outfitters Inc., 11-
cv-2292, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of  Pennsylvania 
(Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
