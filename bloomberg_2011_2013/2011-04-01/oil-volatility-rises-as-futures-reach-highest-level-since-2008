Oil options volatility dropped as
the underlying futures increased to a second consecutive 30-
month high as the U.S. added more jobs than forecast, signaling
increased demand, and as fighting intensified in  Libya .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options that will
expire in May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and
a gauge of options prices, was 30.1 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New
York , down from 31.3 percent yesterday. It was 30.8 percent a
week ago.  Crude for May delivery climbed $1.22, or 1.1 percent, to
$107.94 a barrel, the highest settlement since Sept. 25, 2008,
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Oil gained 2.4 percent this
week and is up 27 percent from a year ago.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
May $92 puts with 1,735 lots changing hands. They slipped 4
cents to 4 cents a barrel. June $140 calls, the next-most active
contract, were unchanged from yesterday at 26 cents a barrel
with 1,214 contracts trading.  One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  May $100 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 3,824 lots changing hands. They fell 39 cents to
52 cents a barrel. The next most active option, May $120 calls,
increased 9 cents to 20 cents a barrel on 3,532 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $150 calls with 39,678
contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 39,363 and
December $100 calls with 38,921.  To contact the reporter on this story:
