Cattle futures rose to a record for
a third straight day on speculation that demand for U.S. beef
may increase as hazardous radiation levels in  Japan  may
contaminate food supplies. Hogs fell.  Cattle in Japan’s Fukushima prefecture are struggling to
survive as radiation leaking from a crippled nuclear power plant
contaminates soil and water and forcing farmers to evacuate the
area. Prices rose 7.2 percent last month, the biggest gain since
November, and capped a 12 percent rally in the first quarter.  “With news coming out of Japan, it only seems to be
spreading a little bit more,” said  Mark Schultz , referring to
concerns that meat supplies may be tainted. “I would suspect we
would see demand continuing.”  Cattle futures for June delivery gained 0.275 cent, or 0.2
percent, to settle at $1.2125 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Earlier, the commodity touched a record of
$1.215.  Prices have jumped 30 percent in the past year as the U.S.
herd dwindled to the lowest since 1958 and meat exports surged.
Wholesale choice-beef rose to $1.893 a pound at midday, the
highest since at least January 2004. U.S. retail-beef prices
touched a record last month. Costs have gained for supermarkets
and restaurants including Wendy’s/Arby’s Group Inc.  Japan  bought  about 1,400 metric tons (about 3.1 million
pounds) of U.S. beef last week, down from the 3,900 tons bought
the  previous  week, and lower than the 2,800-ton purchase in the
 week  ended March 10, before the earthquake and tsunami struck
the Asian country.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement advanced 0.65
cent, or 0.5 percent, to $1.41875 a pound. Earlier, the price
climbed to a record of $1.42.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.3 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $1.03575 a pound in Chicago. Earlier, the commodity
reached $1.0435, the highest for a most-active contract since at
least April 1986. The price surged 30 percent in the first
quarter, the most since the period ended Dec. 31, 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
