TA Holdings Ltd . of Zimbabwe needs
$200 million to convert its Sable Chemicals hydro-electrolysis
fertilizer plant to a gasification plant that would make the
ammonium nitrate fertilizer at a lower cost,  Newsday  said,
citing Chairman Shingai Mutasa.  The conversion, which will cut the plant’s electricity
consumption from 115 megawatts to 30 megawatts, has been
approved by TA’s board, the Harare-based newspaper said on its
website.  The company plans to borrow some of the money by accessing
funds Zimbabwe has received from  China , Mutasa told Newsday. TA
Holdings made an after-tax loss of $5.1 million last year,
Newsday said. The company owns 51 percent of Sable Chemicals,
which lost $8.3 million in the same period.  Sable is  Zimbabwe ’s only maker of ammonium nitrate, a key
ingredient in many agricultural fertilizers and in some
explosives. The Sable hydro-electrolysis plant is the world’s
largest and the biggest consumer of electricity in Zimbabwe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
