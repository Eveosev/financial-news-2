Areva SA (CEI)  Chief Executive Officer
 Anne Lauvergeon ’s compensation jumped 16 percent last year as a
bonus tied to the sale of the nuclear-services company’s power-
grid unit offset a drop in variable pay tied to performance.  Lauvergeon’s total compensation rose to 1.07 million euros
($1.5 million) in 2010 from 925,666 euros in 2009, according to
the Paris-based company’s annual  reference document . That
includes a 188,316-euro bonus “in recognition of the perfect
implementation of the sale of the T&D subsidiary three months
ahead of the established deadline,” the report said.  Lauvergeon’s fixed compensation rose 1.2 percent in 2010 to
564,960 euros, and her variable compensation based on the prior
year’s performance fell 14 percent to 312,620 euros.  Lauvergeon, who has expressed a desire to remain at the
helm of Areva for a third term when her mandate ends in June,
sold the grid unit to Alstom SA and Schneider Electric SA as
part of a plan to shore up the group’s finances, which have been
hurt in recent years by construction delays and cost overruns at
a nuclear plant in  Finland .  Areva Chief Operating Officer Gerald Arbola was given a
bonus of 145,517 euros for the sale of the grid unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
