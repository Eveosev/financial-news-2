Weather for crops in  Russia  will be
“mainly satisfactory” in April in both European and Asian
parts of the country, the country’s Hydrometeorological Center
said on its  website  today.  Conditions will be satisfactory for the start of spring
sowing in the so-called Black Earth area this month, it said.  Cold weather delayed sowing in parts of the Caucasus
federal districts in March, according to the center. Planting
resumed this week for barley, peas and sugar beets in the
Krasnodar region, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
