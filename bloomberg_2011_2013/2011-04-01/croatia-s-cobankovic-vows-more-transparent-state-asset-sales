Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Petar Cobankovic said future state-asset sales will be more efficient
and in a “transparent manner.”  A new office,  Agency for Management of State Property , has
taken over the combined duties of the  Privatization Fund  and the
central office for management of state property, Cobankovic
said. The fund has for years arranged sales of stakes or entire
companies run by the state under  Yugoslavia ’s communist regime
to private investors. Both institutions have been made
redundant.  “The management and sale of state property will be done
from one place, and in a transparent way,” Cobankovic told
journalists today in the capital city Zagreb.  The agency will supervise the sale of building land, as
well as residential and business objects and companies in which
the state has a stake, Cobankovic said.  “Our priority is to continue with the sale of about 150
companies in which the state holds a minority stake,”
Cobankovic said. He also said Croatia will continue with the
sale of its “tourist portfolio” of hotels and tourism-related
industries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
