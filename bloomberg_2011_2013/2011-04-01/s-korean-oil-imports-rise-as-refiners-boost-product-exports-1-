South Korea ,  Asia ’s fourth-largest
crude buyer, increased oil imports for an 11th month as the
global economic recovery spurred refiners to produce more fuel
for sale abroad.  Imports rose to 80 million barrels in March from 66.8
million barrels a year earlier, the  Ministry of Knowledge
Economy  said in an e-mailed statement today.  Oil-product exports jumped 88 percent by value while
shipments of petrochemicals gained 24 percent, the ministry
said. Rising global demand and some demand-supply imbalance
helped boost unit prices of such products, the ministry said.  South Korea’s crude import bill gained 60 percent to $8.3
billion in March as Asian benchmark Dubai prices jumped 34
percent to $103.6 a barrel, the ministry said. Gas import costs
were up by 23 percent while coal prices rose 67 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
