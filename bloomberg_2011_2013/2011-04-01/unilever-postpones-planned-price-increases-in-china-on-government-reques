Unilever, the world’s second-largest
consumer-goods maker, will postpone price increases in  China 
previously scheduled to begin today after the government asked
it to reconsider.  “Following the request of the National Development and
Reform Commission, Unilever China has decided to postpone price
adjustments previously scheduled for April 1,” Lucila Zambrano,
a London-based company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday.  Controlling inflation, which has exceeded targets for eight
consecutive months, is the Chinese government’s top economic
priority amid concerns that food and property prices may stir
social unrest. China National Radio reported March 29 that the
National Development and Reform Commission, the country’s top
economic planner, would investigate companies’ plans to raise
prices.  Tingyi (Caymen Islands) Holding Corp., China’s biggest
maker of packaged food, yesterday said it will delay raising
prices for some instant noodles.  Unilever earlier this week sold 300 million yuan ($46
million) of bonds in  Hong Kong , becoming the first European
consumer company to sell so-called dim sum bonds. The bond sale
will help fuel the company’s plans “by increasing our
investment in China,” Graeme Pitkethly, Unilever’s Group
Treasurer, said in an e-mailed statement announcing the deal.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
