Stocks rallied, adding to gains from
the biggest first-quarter advance for U.S. indexes since 1998,
after American employers added more jobs than forecast and
manufacturing industries grew. Oil surged to the highest price
since September 2008 and Treasuries climbed.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.5 percent to
1,332.41 at 4 p.m. in New York, paring an earlier rally of as
much as 0.9 percent. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced to
the highest level since June 2008.  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  surged 13
percent after receiving a second takeover bid. The Stoxx Europe
600 Index climbed 1.5 percent. Oil rallied to near $108 a
barrel, while corn jumped the exchange limit. Yields on 30-year
Treasury bonds slipped two basis points to 4.49 percent.  The S&P 500 climbed to the highest level since February
after U.S. payrolls grew by 216,000 workers last month and
another report showed manufacturing expanded at near the fastest
pace in seven years.  China ’s manufacturing accelerated while
South Korea’s exports surged. Ireland said yesterday it won’t
force losses on senior bondholders, even after revealing that it
may need to inject 24 billion euros ($34 billion) into the
financial system.  “The jobs report confirms that the  U.S. economy  is
recovering in a slow grinding upwards move,” said  Stephen Wood ,
the New York-based chief market strategist for Russell
Investments, which manages $155 billion. “It means we’re very
comfortable with our forecast that this will be a slightly
better-than-average year for equities.”  Payrolls, NYSE  Industrial, financial and consumer-discretionary companies
led gains in eight of 10 industries in the S&P 500 after the
benchmark gauge yesterday capped a 5.4 percent first-quarter
rally. NYSE Euronext, operator of the New York Stock Exchange,
jumped after Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and IntercontinentalExchange
proposed to buy the company for $42.50 in cash and stock,
topping an offer from Deutsche Boerse AG.  U.S. equities pared gains in the final 90 minutes of
trading amid speculation funds that track the  S&P 500  were
selling shares to raise money to purchase stock in BlackRock
Inc., the investment firm replacing drugmaker Genzyme Corp. in
the benchmark index after the close of trading today. BlackRock
rose for a third day, climbing 0.7 percent.  “That 4 point gap down in the SPX a few minutes ago --
’hearing’ that since BLK is getting added to the SPX after the
close that Indexers are out there raising cash,”  Dave Lutz ,
head of exchange-traded fund trading and strategy at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said in a note to clients, using
the ticker symbols for the S&P 500 and BlackRock.  Unemployment Rate  Today’s government jobs report also showed the unemployment
rate unexpectedly declined to a two-year low of 8.8 percent. The
Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index was little
changed at 61.2, after February’s 61.4 reading that was the
highest since May 2004. Figures greater than 50 signal
expansion.  Oil in  New York  rose 1.1 percent to $107.94 a barrel, the
highest settlement since Sept. 25, 2008. Corn extended a two-day
rally to 11 percent after Department of Agriculture data
yesterday showed lower supplies. The S&P GSCI Total Return Index
of commodities climbed 0.8 percent to the highest level since
November 2008.  The yield on the two-year Treasury note slipped three basis
points to less than 0.80 percent, while the 10-year yield lost
two basis points to 3.45 percent.  The gain in Treasuries came after Federal Reserve Bank of
New York President  William Dudley  said the U.S. economy’s
recovery is “still tenuous” and “far from the mark” of the
central bank’s goals of full employment and price stability.  “We must not be overly optimistic about the growth
outlook,” Dudley said in  San Juan ,  Puerto Rico , today. “A
stronger recovery with more rapid progress toward our dual
mandate objectives is what we have been seeking. This is welcome
and not a reason to reverse course.”  Fed Speakers  Fed Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said the
central bank should review whether to reduce its planned
purchase of $600 billion in U.S. Treasury securities because of
improving U.S. economic data. Minneapolis Fed President  Narayana Kocherlakota  told the Wall Street Journal that policy makers may
need to increase their key rate 75 basis points by late 2011.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index advanced 1.4 percent to the
highest level since June 2008. Emerging-market equity funds
attracted inflows of $2.6 billion in the week ended March 30,
the most since the period ended Jan. 5, Citigroup Inc. said in a
report today, citing data compiled by EPFR Global.  European Stocks   Almost seven shares gained for every one that declined in
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  France ’s biggest
bank, rose 3.6 percent and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  advanced 4.3 percent.  Bank of Ireland Plc, the country’s largest lender, jumped
41 percent as it outlined plans to avoid majority government
control after being ordered to raise 5.2 billion euros following
a  stress test . Irish Life & Permanent Plc tumbled 59 percent as
the state said it may take control of company. The yield on the
Irish two-year note slipped 22 basis points to 9.65 percent,
while default swaps on Ireland slid four basis points to 634.9.  Credit swaps on  Portugal  dropped 16 basis points to 564.7
after the government sold 1.6 billion euros of bonds due in June
2012. Contracts on  Spain  were eight basis points lower at 226.4.
The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell four basis points to 170.  The yen fell 1.1 percent versus the dollar, an eighth day
of declines in its longest retreat since July 2005. The Dollar
Index, which tracks the greenback against those of six trading
partners, was little changed at 75.829.  Ivory Coast’s defaulted dollar bonds climbed 4.7 percent,
extending the best week since they began trading last year.
