The pound climbed for a third week
versus the dollar, the longest run of gains since September, as
a report showed U.K. jobless claims fell more than economists
forecast in May, adding to signs the economy is recovering.  Sterling climbed to its highest level in more than four
months against the U.S. currency as a wider measure of
 unemployment (UKUEILOR)  declined in April, adding to speculation Bank of
England policy makers will refrain from expanding their asset-purchase plan. Gilts were little changed after 10-year yields
rose to the highest level since February as the U.K. sold 6
billion pounds ($9.4 billion) of debt due in 2023 and 2032.  “Recent data, especially the jobs report, suggested the
economy has stabilized,” said Jane Foley, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank International in London.
“Whilst it’s got to be said that all these economic numbers
came from a very weak base, they certainly showed some
improvement. From that point of view, sterling’s recovery is
justified.”  The pound advanced 0.8 percent in the week to $1.5684 as of
5 p.m.  London  time yesterday. It rose to $1.5738 on June 13, the
strongest level since Feb. 11. Sterling was little changed at
84.99 pence per euro.  U.K.  jobless claims  fell by 8,600 in May to 1.51 million,
the Office for National Statistics said in London on June 12.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted a decline of
5,000. Unemployment as measured by International Labour
Organisation methods fell 5,000 in the three months through
April to 2.51 million, a rate of 7.8 percent.  Best Performer  Sterling has gained 3.9 percent in the past three months,
the best performer among the 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
fell 0.6 percent and the euro appreciated 2.2 percent.  The  10-year gilt yield  was little changed this week at 2.06
percent. The rate climbed to 2.24 percent on June 11, the most
since Feb. 14. The price of the 1.75 percent bond due in
September 2022 was at 97.40.  The Debt Management Office auctioned 3.75 billion pounds of
new benchmark  gilts (BRIT)  maturing in 2023 on June 11 and 2.25 billion
pounds of securities due in 2032 two days later. The U.K. is
scheduled to sell 4.75 billion pounds of gilts due in 2018 on
June 20.  Minutes from Mervyn King’s last Monetary Policy Committee
meeting as governor of the Bank of England, when officials kept
the size of their asset-purchase program at 375 billion pounds,
are scheduled for release on June 19.  Deputy Governor Paul Tucker, who voted against expanding
quantitative easing in the 10 meetings through May’s, will leave
the institution after helping King’s successor Mark Carney
settle into his new post, the central bank said yesterday.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.7 percent this year
through June 13, according to the Bloomberg U.K. Sovereign Bond
Index. German bonds dropped 0.9 percent and Treasuries declined
1.1 percent, separate Bloomberg indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
