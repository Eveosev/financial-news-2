The Canadian dollar rose to the
strongest level in a month against its U.S. peer as investors
bet a strengthening economy will convince the  Bank of Canada  to
raise its benchmark  interest rate .  The currency gained for a second week versus the greenback
as volatility in global foreign-exchange markets reached the
highest in a year amid speculation on when the  Federal Reserve 
will start tapering monetary stimulus. Canada posted its
strongest  job gains  in more than a decade last month and  home
construction  rose the most in 13 months, driving expectations to
the highest in more than a year the Bank of Canada will raise
rates. Oil rose to a nine-month high.  “The market had been bearishly positioned, we saw some
better data and I think the market is taking stock again, taking
a fresh look at the Canadian dollar,” Jane Foley, chief
currency strategist at Rabobank International, said by phone
from  London . “We’ll probably lack confidence until we see much
clearer signs of a pickup in U.S. growth, but nevertheless,
Canada is proving that it’s still holding some strong cards.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.3 percent this week
to C$1.0170 per  U.S. dollar  in Toronto after gaining 1.7 percent
the week before. One loonie buys 98.33 U.S. cents.  Bonds Rise  Canada’s 10-year benchmark government  bonds  rose, with
yields falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
2.12 percent, after reaching 2.21 percent June 21, the highest
in 15 months. The 1.5 percent security maturing in June 2023
gained 23 cents to C$94.48.  Futures on crude oil, Canada’s largest export, gained 1.9
percent to $97.88 per barrel, after touching $98.25, its highest
September. The  discount  Canada faces for its oil compared to
U.S. benchmarks widened to $10.25 per barrel after touching
$9.25, its narrowest in nine months on June 12.  The JPMorgan G7  Volatility Index  touched reached 11.2
percent, its highest since June 2012.  Futures traders  decreased their bets  that the Canadian
dollar will decline against the greenback, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The
difference in the number of wagers on a decline in the loonie
compared with those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was
35,907 on June 11, compared with net shorts of 39,776 a week
earlier.  Economic Data  “We had that big employment number last week, and early
this week we kind of thought, well, that’s going to dissipate
and that’ll be it, but it’s kind of held on to those gains,”
Don Mikolich, executive director of foreign exchange sales at
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said by phone from Toronto.
“ Canada ’s benefiting from the good news from the U.S. -- it’s
own data has not disproved the big employment number yet -- so
we’ve been able to hold on.”  U.S.  retail sales  rose 0.6 percent, the biggest increase in
three months, following a 0.1 percent gain in April, Commerce
Department figures showed June 13. The median forecast of 83
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.4 percent
advance.  In Canada, construction began on 200,178 homes at a
seasonally adjusted annual pace in May, up 13.8 percent from
April and the highest level since November, Canada Mortgage &
Housing Corp. reported June 10.  Canadian  manufacturing  sales dropped 2.4 percent to C$48.2
billion ($47.4 billion),  Statistics Canada  said June 14, while
inventories rose to the highest in records dating to 1992.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast sales would rise 0.3
percent.  ‘Uneven’ Recovery  “We have had a string of surprisingly strong data,”
 Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at  Bank of Nova
Scotia (BNS) , said by phone from Toronto yesterday. The weak factory-sales report “just highlights the data is still quite uneven as
the recovery is still quite uneven.”  The rate for the one-year forward overnight index swap, or
OIS, rose to the highest level since May 2012, touching 1.42
percent on June 10, or 42 basis points more than the Bank of
Canada’s target rate. The measure, which shows the market’s
expectation for the one-year average central-bank rate beginning
in one year’s time, was predicting a rate cut last June.  The Bank of Canada, whose key interest rate of  1 percent  is
the highest among the Group of Seven nations, is the only
central bank among them with a leaning, or bias, toward higher
rates. New central-bank Governor Stephen Poloz reiterated that
stance in his first public comments on June 6. He will give his
first speech as governor on June 19 in Oakville, Ontario.  Fed Transparency  Fed policy makers next meet on June 18-19 after Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 the central bank could reduce its
monthly purchases of $45 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion
of mortgage-backed securities, known as quantitative easing, if
the employment outlook shows sustainable improvement. Stimulus
tends to debase the currency.  A Bloomberg survey of 59 economists on June 7 estimated the
central bank will reduce its buying to $65 billion a month at
its Oct. 29-30 meeting.  The Fed’s “transparency isn’t actually working terribly
well -- it’s actually engendering market volatility,”  Alan Ruskin , global head of Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy in
 New York  at Deutsche Bank AG, said yesterday on Bloomberg
Television. “We want to know a lot in terms of clarity -- what
are the data parameters behind this? When you taper, how do you
taper?”  The Canadian dollar was the second-worst performer in the
past week among a basket of 10 developed nation currencies
tracked by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Index. The loonie
dropped 1 percent, trailing only the U.S. dollar’s 1.3 percent
decline. The yen added 2.8 percent to pace gainers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
