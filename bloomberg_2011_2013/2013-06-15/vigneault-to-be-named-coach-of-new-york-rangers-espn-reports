Alain Vigneault will be hired as the
next coach of the  New York  Rangers, ESPN reported, citing a
source it didn’t identify.  Vigneault will succeed  John Tortorella , who was fired May
29, four days after the Rangers were eliminated in the second
round of the National Hockey League playoffs.  Seven days before Tortorella’s dismissal, the Vancouver
Canucks fired Vigneault and two assistants after the team was
swept by the San Jose Sharks in the first round of the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
