A case of Romanee-Conti 1988 Domaine
de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy fetched 81,900 pounds ($128,000) at
a Christie’s International Plc wine sale in London this month as
 Chateau Petrus  and  Chateau Latour  led the bidding for Bordeaux.  The price for the Romanee-Conti, including buyer’s premium,
compared with an upper estimate of as much as 90,000 pounds
before fees, according to results of the June 6 auction on
Christie’s website. Six bottles of the same producer’s 1999 and
1995 wines fetched 44,460 pounds and 42,120 pounds respectively.  Appetite for vintage Burgundies has helped underpin the
market this year as demand remains weak for Bordeaux. The Liv-ex
Fine Wine 50 Index has dropped 2 percent since mid-March, after
four months of gains, as investors showed reluctance to buy 2012
Bordeaux wine futures after lower-than-estimated price cuts.  The 2012 Bordeaux marketing season “concluded with little
change from the earlier pattern of generally disappointing sales
due to the high release prices demanded by the chateaux,” said
 Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund in
London, in his latest monthly market report. The fund, invested
in Bordeaux, has about $50 million under management.  Among top Bordeaux in the Christie’s sale, a case of
Chateau Petrus 1990 Pomerol sold for 29,250 pounds, a similar
quantity of Chateau Latour 1982 Pauillac fetched 12,870 pounds
and 12 bottles of Chateau Cheval Blanc sold for 9,945 pounds.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
