U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel
approved a request from  Jordan  for a detachment of F-16 aircraft
and Patriot missiles to remain in Jordan next week after the end
of an annual military exercise called Eager Lion, according to a
statement from Pentagon spokesman  George Little .  “The United States enjoys a long-standing partnership with
Jordan and is committed to its defense,” the statement said.  Jordan borders Syria, where forces loyal to Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad captured a suburb of Damascus near the
international airport, according to the official Syrian Arab
News Agency today. The U.S. has decided to send light weapons to
aid the rebels fighting Assad in the civil war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
