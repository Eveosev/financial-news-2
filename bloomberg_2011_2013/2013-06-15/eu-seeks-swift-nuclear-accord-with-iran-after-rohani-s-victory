The European Union said it hopes
that Hassan Rohani’s election as  Iran ’s president will pave the
way to a “swift diplomatic solution” to the standoff over the
Iranian nuclear program.  “I remain firmly committed to working with the new Iranian
leadership toward a swift diplomatic solution of the nuclear
issue,” EU foreign policy chief  Catherine Ashton  said in an
emailed statement in Brussels today.  Ashton, who represents the five United Nations Security
Council powers plus Germany in talks with Iran, said Rohani’s
first-round victory gives him a “strong mandate” to govern
Iran.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
