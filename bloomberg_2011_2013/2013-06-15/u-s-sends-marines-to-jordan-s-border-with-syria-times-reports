The U.S. has located 300 Marines in
northern Jordan near the border with  Syria  along with a Patriot
anti-aircraft missile system, the London-based Times reported.  The deployment north of Al-Mafraq is being described as a
military training exercise but it will remain in place for
several months, the newspaper said.  The troops and equipment are designed to increase stability
in the region and are not part of the effort to train Syrian
rebels or take part in any offensive operations in Syria, the
newspaper cited unidentified U.S. officials speaking on
condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk
about the details as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
