Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Alex Cobb
suffered a mild concussion after he was hit in the right side of
the head by a line drive off the bat of Eric Hosmer of the
 Kansas City Royals , the Major League Baseball team said.  Hosmer connected on a fastball that hit Cobb and bounced
back toward home plate yesterday. The right-handed pitcher’s hat
was knocked off and he fell to the ground, clutching his head at
Tropicana Field in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida .  “It’s just one of those really, really bad moments,” Rays
manager Joe Maddon told reporters. “Everybody feels terrible
about it, but that’s part of our game and it stinks sometimes.
It’s a horrible moment to witness.”  Cobb, 25, remained conscious while the Rays’ training staff
tended to him on the mound. He was transported to Bayfront
Medical Center where he was diagnosed with a concussion.  “He seemed pretty normal so that was good,” said teammate
 David Price  who visited Cobb in the hospital. “It’s scary, it
is, watching that happen.”  Cobb allowed two runs on four hits and struck out three in
4 1/3 innings, leaving the game with the Rays ahead 3-2. The
Rays went on to win the game 5-3.  On May 7, Toronto Blue Jays left-hander J.A. Happ was hit
behind the left ear by a line drive off the bat of Rays center
fielder Desmond Jennings in a game at Tropicana Field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
