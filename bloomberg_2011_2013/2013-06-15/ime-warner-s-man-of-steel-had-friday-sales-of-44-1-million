“Man of Steel” had $44.1 million
in box-office receipts yesterday for  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s Warner
Bros., box-office tracker Hollywood.com-Box Office said.  The reboot of the Superman movie franchise was expected to
earn $120 million this weekend, according to researcher
Boxoffice.com. Paul Dergarabedian, president of Hollywood.com’s
box-office division, forecast the film may earn as much as $110
million this weekend.  If the projections hold, the film would have the second-best opening weekend this year trailing that of Walt Disney
Co.’s “Iron Man 3,” which took in $174.1 million in its debut
last month. The current No. 2 is Comcast Corp.’s “Fast &
Furious 6,” with $97.4 million in its opening weekend, also in
May.  Time Warner spend an estimated $225 million making the film
in a bet that “Man of Steel,” starring British actor Henry
Cavill, can make a profit and be the start of a new Superman
franchise.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
