Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
most popular social-networking service, said it got as many as
10,000 data requests from U.S. government entities involving
national-security related requests.  The requests, which came from local, state and federal
governments, were for the six-month period ended Dec. 31 and
“run the gamut,” the company said in a posting on its website.  Facebook said it was releasing the data after discussions
with U.S. national security authorities “to allow more
transparency and flexibility around national-security orders we
are required to comply with.”  The networking service says it has 1.1 billion active users
worldwide and the requests represent a small fraction of those
users.  The posting, written by Facebook General Counsel Ted
Ullyot, said that betweeen 18,000 and 19,000 users accounts were
involved in the requested data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
