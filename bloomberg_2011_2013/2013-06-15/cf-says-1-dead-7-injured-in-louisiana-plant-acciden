CF Industries Holdings Inc. (CF) , the
largest U.S. producer of nitrogen fertilizer, said one person
died and seven were injured after a blast at a plant in
Donaldsonville, Louisiana.  Six of the seven workers were treated and released, while
one remains hospitalized in stable condition, the company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  CF Industries  said the accident happened about 6 p.m. local
time when an inert nitrogen vessel ruptured during the off-loading of nitrogen. The incident occurred in a part of the
plant that had been shut for maintenance, and there was no fire
or chemical release.  Ammonia and other nitrogen fertilizers are made at the
plant, which is about 66 miles (106 kilometers) northwest of  New
Orleans . Nitrogen fertilizer is added to soil to provide
nutrients that aid plant growth.  The company said it’s investigating the incident, along
with local and regulatory authorities, including the  Occupational
Safety and Health Administration .  The accident came just days after an explosion at a
Williams Cos. chemical plant in Geismar, Louisiana, which killed
two workers and left 77 people seeking medical treatment.  An April 17 blast at a fertilizer plant in West, Texas,
killed 14 people and injured more than 200, the nation’s worst
industrial accident since 2010.  CF Industries is based in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield.  To contact the reporter on this story:
