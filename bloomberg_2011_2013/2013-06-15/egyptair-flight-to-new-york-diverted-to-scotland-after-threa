An EgyptAir plane carrying more than
300 people to  New York  from Cairo made an emergency landing in
Scotland after a note was discovered containing a threat to the
aircraft, Egypt’s state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  Flight 985 was diverted to  Glasgow Prestwick Airport  five
hours after taking off from the Egyptian capital bound for John
F. Kennedy Airport, MENA said.  “At 14:25 an EgyptAir flight arrived,” Alan Clark, a
spokesman for Prestwick airport, said by telephone. “It has
been diverted. The police are in attendance.”  The  BBC reported  on its website that a New York-based
producer for the broadcaster discovered the note in a restroom
on the plane, a  Boeing 777 . MENA reported that a flight
attendant found the note.  The 326 passengers were still aboard the plane more than
three hours after it landed and would be interviewed by police
after leaving the aircraft, the  BBC  reported, citing a
spokeswoman for Police Scotland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
