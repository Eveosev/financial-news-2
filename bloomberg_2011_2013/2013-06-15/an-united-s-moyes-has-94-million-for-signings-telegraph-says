New Manchester United manager David
Moyes has 60 million pounds ($94 million) to sign new players as
he makes over the team after the retirement of Alex Ferguson,
the Daily Telegraph said.  Moyes took over after the season when Ferguson left the
Premier League soccer champions. The new coach is interesting in
signing Leighton Baines from his old club Everton, Barcelona
midfielders Cesc Fàbregas and Thiago Alcantara and Borussia
Dortmund forward Robert Lewandowski, the newspaper said.  United has been put off signing Everton midfielder Marouane
Fellaini because of his 23 million pound buy-out clause, it
said.  The 60 million pounds is more than Ferguson got in a season
to spend on new players, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
