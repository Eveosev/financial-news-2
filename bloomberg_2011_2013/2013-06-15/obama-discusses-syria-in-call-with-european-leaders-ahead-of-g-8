U.S. President  Barack Obama  spoke
with European leaders today about ending the conflict in Syria
and promoting democracy in Libya, two issues topping the agenda
for next week’s Group of Eight summit in Northern Ireland.  Participating in the hour-long videoconference call were
U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, and Italian Prime
Minister Enrico Letta, according to a statement from Cameron’s
office.  The leaders discussed how G-8 countries should work toward
a political solution in Syria, where more than 93,000 people
have been killed in a two-year civil war between President
Bashar al-Assad’s regime and opposition forces, according to the
statement.  The U.S., U.K. and France are among G-8 members that have
said Assad’s departure is essential to any political transition.
 Russia , another G-8 member, is a long-time ally of the Assad
regime and one of the Syrian government’s top arms suppliers.  The G-8 is composed of leaders from the U.S., France, U.K.,
 Germany , Italy, Japan, Canada and Russia. Leaders will gather
June 17-18 at the Lough Erne resort in County Fermanagh in
Northern Ireland to discuss topics that also include tax havens
and trade proposals. Obama departs in the evening on June 16 and
will travel to Germany after G-8 meetings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
