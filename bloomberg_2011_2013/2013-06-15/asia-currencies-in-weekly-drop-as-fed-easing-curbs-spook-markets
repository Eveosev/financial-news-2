Asian currencies fell, with  India ’s
rupee touching a record low, on concern U.S. policy makers will
pare stimulus that has driven inflows to  emerging markets .  The  Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index (ADXY) , which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies, dropped 0.2 percent to
116.74 and was 0.7 percent off a nine-month low reached June 11.
Bets that the Federal Reserve will cut bond purchases spurred
record outflows of $14.4 billion from global bond funds in the
week to June 12 and $8.5 billion from equities, a Citigroup Inc.
report said citing EPFR data. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of
stocks rose yesterday after posting its biggest loss in three
weeks on June 13 as the World Bank cut global growth estimates.  “Asian currencies and assets remain vulnerable as
speculation of a reduction in quantitative easing is still
lingering,”  Tsutomu Soma , manager of Rakuten Securities Inc.’s
fixed-income business unit in  Tokyo , said yesterday. “There’s a
temporary improvement in risk sentiment today and probably a
correction of quite a big sell-off, but the basic environment
and trend for the region hasn’t changed.”  The Philippine peso led the week’s declines, retreating 1.3
percent to 42.805 per dollar in  Manila , data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The rupee fell 0.8 percent to 57.5287 and the
South Korean won declined 0.8 percent to 1,126.25.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six
major counterparts, was down 1.2 percent for the week. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index climbed 1.3 percent yesterday, after dropping
2.2 percent on June 13, and was up 0.3 percent from the previous
week.  Currency Intervention  Losses in regional currencies have forced central banks
from India to  Thailand  and  Indonesia  to step in to defend their
exchange rates.  The rupee touched a record low of 58.9850 per dollar on
June 11. The Reserve Bank of India intervened the same day and
the next to prevent the currency sliding to 60, according to two
people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named
because the information isn’t public.  The Bank of Thailand is taking measures to smooth
volatility in the baht, and sold “a certain amount of dollars”
in the past week, Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul told reporters
in Bangkok on June 13. The currency gained 0.2 percent this week
to 30.57 per dollar, halting seven weeks of losses. It has
dropped 7 percent since reaching its strongest level since 1997
in April.  Sales at U.S. retailers rose more than economists forecast
in May and fewer Americans filed applications for unemployment
benefit, figures released June 13 showed. Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said last month stimulus could be reduced if the jobs
market shows signs of sustained improvement. The Bank of Japan
also refrained from adding to its stimulus on June 11.  World Bank  The World Bank lowered its 2013 global growth forecast to
2.2 percent from 2.4 percent this week, saying a “recovery
remains hesitant and uneven.”  “Markets are just liquidating on the back of expectations
the Fed will taper off quantitative easing,” said Thio Chin Loo, a senior strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  Singapore .  The peso weakened beyond 43 to the dollar for the first
time in a year this week as overseas investors sold $55 million
more Philippine shares than they bought in the first four days,
taking June net sales to $256 million, exchange data show. The
country has scope to ease monetary policy to protect growth,
central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said yesterday in an
interview with  Rishaad Salamat  on Bloomberg Television.  The central bank kept its benchmark overnight borrowing
rate unchanged at 3.5 percent yesterday. The Philippine
Composite Index of shares rebounded 2.1 percent yesterday after
losing 6.8 percent June 13, the biggest decline since 2008.  ‘Doing Terribly’  “The peso has been doing terribly as the stock market has
dropped,” said Leong Sook Mei, Southeast Asian head of global
markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in
Singapore. “There is no need for rate cuts when the peso is
weakening and the economy is Asia’s best-performing.”  Elsewhere in Asia,  Malaysia ’s ringgit dropped 0.6 percent
for the week to 3.1149 per dollar, Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.7
percent to 9,873 and  Taiwan ’s dollar weakened 0.3 percent to
NT$29.97. The Vietnamese dong rose 0.1 percent to 21,003, while
the Chinese  yuan  was little changed at 6.1308.  To contact the reporter on this story:
