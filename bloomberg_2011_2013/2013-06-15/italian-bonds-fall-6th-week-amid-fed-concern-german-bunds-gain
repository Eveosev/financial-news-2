Italian government bonds fell for a
sixth week, the longest losing streak in a year, amid concern
the Federal Reserve will slow its asset-purchase program that
has boosted higher-yielding securities around the world.  Italy’s 10-year  yields  climbed to the highest level in two
months after a report showed gross domestic product shrank more
than initially reported last quarter. Portuguese and Greek bonds
also dropped this week after European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi said debt purchases will only be used when prices
are out of line with fundamentals. German bunds rose as
speculation central banks will remove stimulus pushed down
stocks and boosted demand for the region’s safest securities.  “If the Fed is thinking about an exit, it doesn’t leave
high-yielding assets in a good position,” said  Harvinder Sian ,
a senior fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc in  London . “What the Fed does will remain the focus of
markets. We also had the downward revision to Italian GDP.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, this week to 4.28 percent after climbing to
4.47 percent on June 11, the highest level since April 5. The
4.5 percent bond due in May 2023 fell 0.705, or 7.05 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,333) face amount, to 102.11. The six-week losing
streak is the longest since April 2012.  Fed policy makers next meet on June 18-19 after Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke said on May 22 that the central bank could
reduce its monthly purchases of $45 billion of Treasuries and
$40 billion of mortgage-backed securities if the employment
outlook shows sustainable improvement.  Economy Shrinks  Italy’s economy  shrank 0.6 percent from the previous three
months, more than the 0.5 percent first reported on May 15, the
Rome-based National Statistics Institute said on June 10.  Portugal ’s  10-year yield  climbed 16 basis points this week
to 6.30 percent after rising to 6.65 percent on June 11, the
highest since Feb. 26. Similar-maturity Greek yields jumped 47
basis points to 9.93 percent.  The ECB’s as-yet-unused program to the buy the bonds of the
region’s most indebted nations, known as Outright Monetary
Transactions, will only target yields that are out of line with
fundamentals, Draghi said in an interview on German ZDF
television on June 11.  “We will not intervene to ensure the solvency of countries
that can’t” deal with money, he said.  German and French bonds advanced this week as stocks slid
around the world on concern a withdrawal of Fed stimulus will
curtail global growth.  The German  10-year yield  dropped three basis points this
week to 1.52 percent and  France ’s declined four basis points to
2.09 percent.  Italian bonds returned 2.6 percent this year through June
13, according to the Bloomberg Italy Sovereign  Bond Index. (BITA) 
Portuguese bonds returned 3.6 percent, while German bonds
declined 0.9 percent, separate indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
