Treasuries rose, breaking the
longest streak of weekly losses since 2009, amid skepticism the
 Federal Reserve  is about to slow its bond-buying program
designed to hold down borrowing costs and spur the economy.  Ten-year note  yields  dropped for the first week since April
after reaching a 14-month high as investors weighed whether the
economy is  strengthening  enough for policy makers to consider
reducing their quantitative-easing stimulus. The U.S. sold $66
billion in notes and bonds to below-average demand. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  and the policy-setting  Federal Open Market
Committee  meet June 18-19.  “It’s the calm before the storm for the Treasury market,”
said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist in New York at BNP
Paribas SA, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the
central bank. “The reality is the bloodletting could continue a
little bit longer if the Fed disappoints at the next meeting.
The Fed has control over the tenor and the tone of the Treasury
market. The area where the street is still adjusting
expectations is the speed of tapering.”  U.S. 10-year  yields  fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.13 percent this week in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.75
percent note due May 2023 advanced 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face
amount, to 96 5/8.  The benchmark yield climbed to 2.29 percent on June 11, the
highest since April 2012, after reaching a 2013 low of 1.61
percent May 1. It rose for the six weeks ended June 7, the
longest stretch since May 2009.  Long Bonds  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  bond yields declined three basis points to 3.31
percent. They increased to 3.43 percent on June 11, also the
highest since April 2012, before snapping a six-week losing
streak, their longest since May 2009.  “The market is in the process of refining Fed policy
expectations,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at
CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . Investors are
curtailing “expectations for the Fed to be more aggressive on
the tapering front,” Lyngen said.  U.S. government securities have lost 1.1 percent this year,
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Treasury Index shows.
They returned 2.2 percent in 2012 and 9.8 percent in 2011.  Treasuries due in a decade or more are at almost the
cheapest level since July 2011 relative to global peers with
comparable maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Yields on U.S. debt were 59 basis points higher
than those in an index of other sovereign debt on June 13. The
yields were 62 basis points higher on June 10, the most since
July 28, 2011.  High Volatility  Volatility in Treasuries as  measured  by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE Index ended the week at almost the highest
level in a year. It was at 78.45 yesterday, after rising to
84.75 on June 6 and June 10, the most since June 2012. It
averaged 62 over the past 12 months.  Hedge-fund managers and other large investors  reversed 
their bets on 10-year note futures for a fifth straight week,
taking a net-short position, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data.  Speculative short positions, or wagers that prices will
fall, on the futures outnumbered long positions by 9,195
contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade for the week ended June
11. Last week, traders were net-long 19,684 contracts.  Demand fell this week at Treasury note and bond auctions
amid speculation the Fed might cut back stimulus. The securities
drew lower-than-average bids for a third consecutive month.  ‘Some Trepidation’  “There seems to be some trepidation stepping in,
especially in front of the FOMC meeting,”  Kevin Flanagan , chief
fixed-income strategist in Purchase, New York, for Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney, said on June 12. “They are looking for
clarity from the committee.”  Demand has slackened this year at auctions of coupon-bearing Treasuries. Investors placed $2.96 of offers for each
dollar of debt sold at the government’s $971 billion in auctions
of Treasury notes and bonds, compared with a record bid-to-cover
ratio of $3.15 in 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
securities a month to spur the economy, and has kept the  target 
for overnight lending between banks at almost zero since
December 2008. Treasury yields surged since May as investors bet
the central bank would slow the purchases amid data that showed
increases in U.S. payrolls and home sales, even as first-quarter
gross domestic product expanded less than first estimated and
 consumer spending  fell in April.  Speculation Overblown  Ten-year yields  dropped this week as traders said wagers
the Fed would slow stimulus as soon as its next meeting were
overblown.  “The market could have overreacted to tapering, and this
brings us back to solid ground,” Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at the primary dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP in
New York.  Bernanke, in testimony to the Joint Economic Committee on
May 22, said the Fed “expects a highly accommodative stance of
monetary policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time
after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery
strengthens.”  The Fed chief is scheduled to hold a press conference next
week after policy makers’ meeting ends.  Traders lowered bets on inflation. The yield  gap  between
10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities and comparable
nominal  U.S. debt , which signals expectations for prices over
the term of the debt, touched 2 percentage points on June 13,
the least since January 2012.  Foreign Holdings  Foreign holdings of Treasuries fell in April by the most
since June 2006, according to the Treasury International Capital
report released yesterday in  Washington .  Total holdings of U.S. government securities fell by $69.6
billion, or 1.2 percent, to $5.67 trillion.  Foreign official holders, such as  central banks  and finance
ministries, reduced their holdings by $28.5 billion, or 0.7
percent, to $4.06 trillion, while all other overseas investors
reduced their positions in the debt by $41.1 billion to $1.61
trillion, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
