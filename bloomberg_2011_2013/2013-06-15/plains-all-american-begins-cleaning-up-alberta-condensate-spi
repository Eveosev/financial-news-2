Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA) 
began cleaning up a spill of condensate from its Kemp natural
gas liquids pipeline system in Alberta.  The company is recovering some of the product, which hasn’t
entered any flowing water bodies, according to the Energy
Resources Conservation Board regulator. Plains reported the
spill yesterday, Cara Tobin, a spokeswoman for the regulator,
said in a telephone interview today.  The size and cause of the spill isn’t yet known, the
company said in a statement today.  “It was discovered by an electronic detection system” on
the pipeline, Tobin said. She also was unable to provide an
estimate of the spill’s size or its cause. “They were able to
shut everything down right away.”  The spill on the 6-inch pipeline was about 90 kilometers
(56 miles) northwest of Manning, in northern  Alberta , the
company said. The system carries condensate and other natural
gas liquids. Cleanup of gas liquids such as propane and butane
can include burning the light hydrocarbons, digging up
contaminated soil or letting the fuels evaporate, Tobin said.  The pipeline is 79 kilometers long and begins and ends in
Alberta.  Spokesmen for Plains All American’s Canadian unit declined
to immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
