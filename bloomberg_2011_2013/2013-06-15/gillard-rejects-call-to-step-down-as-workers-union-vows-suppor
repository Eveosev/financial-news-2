Prime Minister  Julia Gillard 
dismissed a call from a member of her Labor party to step down
before elections in three months as the Australian Workers Union
pledged support for the country’s first female leader.  Former Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd , who Gillard ousted in a
backroom party coup in June 2010, should lead Labor to the next
election, the Australian newspaper  reported  on its website
today, citing lawmaker  John Murphy . Gillard is the right person
to lead the party to September’s election, the Age newspaper
 said  on its website today, citing AWU national secretary Paul
Howes.  “Mr Murphy has had a continuing view for some time now,”
Gillard told reporters in Adelaide today. “All the rumor and
speculation, I just let that wash its way round.”  Parliament sits for a final two weeks starting June 17
before campaigning gets into full swing with Gillard needing an
unprecedented recovery in popularity to win the Sept. 14
elections. Polls show Labor faces a landslide defeat by  Tony Abbott ’s Liberal National coalition, while the Australian
newspaper this week cited an internal Labor party survey as
showing Gillard’s minority government may lose as many as 40
seats in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
