Hall of Famer John Velazquez became
the 28th jockey to earn his 5,000th victory when he rode
Galloping Giraffe to victory in the sixth race at New York’s
Belmont Park.  Velazquez, 41, was 3-for-3 on yesterday’s card and hit the
5,000 mark with a horse trained by  Todd Pletcher  at the race
track in Elmont, New York.  “Everybody says that when you get close to a big number
you go into a slump,” Velazquez said in a statement. “I
started to believe it. Everything was second and third, second
and third. I was riding really good races and, unfortunately,
was getting beat. Finally, it’s over.”  Russell Baze Jr. is North America’s winningest jockey with
11,970 victories in 50,450 starts, according to Equibase Co.  Velazquez won his first Triple Crown race in the 2007
Belmont aboard Pletcher’s Rags to Riches. He went on to win the
2011  Kentucky Derby  with  Animal Kingdom  and 2012 Belmont with
Union Rags.  “We’ve been the beneficiary of many great rides by Johnny,
and winning 5,000 races is a tremendous achievement,” Pletcher
said.  Velazquez has been riding in the U.S. since 1990 and won
his first of 26  New York  Racing Association meet titles in the
1996 Aqueduct spring meet. He won the Eclipse Award for North
America’s outstanding jockey in 2004 and 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
