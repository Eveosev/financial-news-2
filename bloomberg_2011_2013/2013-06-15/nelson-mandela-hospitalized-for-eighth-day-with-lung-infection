Former South African President
 Nelson Mandela  remained in hospital for an eighth day for
treatment of a lung infection.  Mandela’s health “continues to improve but his condition
remains serious,” South African President  Jacob Zuma  said in
 statement  after visiting Mandela on June 13.  Mandela, 94, was admitted to the intensive care unit in a
Pretoria hospital on June 8 for treatment relating to a
recurring lung infection. It’s his fourth stay in hospital since
December, after he was treated for pneumonia in April and had
gall stones removed.  Also known by his clan name of Madiba, Mandela was South
Africa’s first black president after the African National
Congress party won the 1994 all-race elections that ended
apartheid. A Nobel Peace Prize Winner in 1993, Mandela spent 27
years in prison, mots of it on Robben Island off the coast of
 Cape Town , where he contracted tuberculosis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
