The  Federal Reserve Bank of New
York  is testing an overnight fixed-rate reverse repurchase
agreement facility that may be used to aid policy makers when
they tighten monetary policy.  The tests, which are temporary open market operations, may
extend through Jan. 29, the New York Fed said in a  statement  on
Sept. 20.  Fed staff members presented officials the possibility of
the facility at the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s meeting in
July. The system would allow the central bank to offer an
overnight, risk-free  instrument  to a “wide range of market
participants,” and possibly improve its ability to keep short-term rates at desired levels, minutes from the gathering showed.  Fed policy makers, while still buying  bonds  to support the
economy, have also been developing methods to eventually help
withdraw record monetary accommodation. Along with raising the
overnight bank lending rate, Fed officials have said they may
use tools including reverse repos to withdraw or neutralize cash
in the banking system.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, temporarily draining cash from the banking system. At
maturity, the securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash
to its counterparties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
