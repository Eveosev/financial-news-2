Czech billionaire Zdenek Bakala,
the largest shareholder of coking coal producer  New World
Resources Plc (NWR) , came under pressure from the country’s two top
politicians for his plan to close the unprofitable Paskov mine.  The company should sell 44,000 apartments it owns in the
Ostrava region to the local government and use the proceeds to
subsidize operations at Paskov, President Milos Zeman and Prime
Minister Jiri Rusnok said today at a press conference in Prague.  “We are very concerned about the economic developments in
the region,” Zeman said. NWR representatives could not be
immediately reached for comment.  NWR said last week it will close Paskov, a coking-coal mine
with 3,000 employees and a yearly loss of 1.5 billion crowns
($78 million), by the end of 2014 unless the government agrees
to provide financial support.  The government has refused to bail out the mine located in
the north-eastern district of Karvina, which has the fourth-highest jobless rate among 77 districts in the country,
according to data from the Labor Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
