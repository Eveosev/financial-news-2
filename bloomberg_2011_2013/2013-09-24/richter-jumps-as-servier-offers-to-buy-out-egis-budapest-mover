Gedeon  Richter Nyrt ., Hungary’s
biggest drugmaker, jumped the most in almost two years as
competitor Egis Nyrt. received a buyout offer from majority
owner Les Laboratoires Servier.  The shares soared as much as 5.3 percent, the most since
October 2011, and traded up 3.9 percent at 3,772 forint by 10:57
a.m. in Budapest. The benchmark BUX stock  index , in which
Richter has the third-biggest weighting at 22 percent, gained
0.8 percent. Trading in Egis, which has the fifth-largest
weighting at 5 percent, was suspended.  Servier, which already controls 51 percent of Egis, offered
28,000 forint for all outstanding shares, compared with
yesterday’s closing price of 21,050 forint, according to a
 statement  to the Budapest Stock Exchange today. Egis may drop
out of the bourse because it doesn’t need equity financing,
Pascal Touchon, Servier’s director of business development, said
in an interview posted on the company’s  website .  “Just because there is a buyout offer, I don’t think
investors will necessarily reduce their exposure to the
Hungarian market,” Attila Vago, a Budapest-based analyst at
brokerage Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt., said by phone. “Some of
those funds will find their way back to  Hungary  and Richter is
the obvious choice.”  The jump in Richter’s shares may help the stock conquer a
resistance level at 3,750 forint, Zsolt Balasy, a Budapest-based
analyst at Bayerische Landesbank unit MKB Bank, wrote in an e-mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
