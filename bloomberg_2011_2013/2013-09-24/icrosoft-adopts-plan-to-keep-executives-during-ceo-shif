Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  is altering its
compensation plan so that the company can use special equity
incentives to retain executives during a transition to a new
chief executive officer.  The software maker’s board approved the potential stock
awards, which will vest over a term of at least 30 months,
seeking to ensure “continuity of key leaders during the
transition,” Microsoft said in a filing yesterday.  Steve Ballmer , Microsoft’s CEO since 2000, said last month
that he will retire within a year and directors are currently
looking for his replacement among internal and external
candidates. The change in leadership is happening amid the
company’s biggest reorganization in more than a decade, as it
grapples with a decline in personal-computer sales as consumers
shift to smartphones and tablets. Adding to the upheaval,
Microsoft said earlier this month that it plans to acquire  Nokia
Oyj (NOK1V) ’s handset business.  While the incentive is also aimed at making sure “key
executives have sufficient unvested equity to provide alignment
with shareholders,” the stock awards won’t exceed share limits
previously in place, the Redmond, Washington-based company said
in the filing.  Some Microsoft executives sought to reassure spooked
managers by e-mailing their staff last month to say they remain
committed to the CEO’s reorganization plan, even after Ballmer
said he would retire, people with knowledge of the matter had
said. Some executives saw an increase in outside job offers
since the restructuring plan was unveiled in July, and others
may be tempted to leave since stock grants and bonuses are
awarded in late August, said the people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
