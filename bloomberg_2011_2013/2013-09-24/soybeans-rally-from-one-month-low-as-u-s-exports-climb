Soybean futures rose for the first
time in four sessions on signs that U.S. crops haven’t benefited
from recent rainfall. Corn and wheat declined.  Soybean  conditions  were unchanged as of Sept. 22 from a
week earlier, with half the plants rated good or excellent, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday. While some parts
of the Midwest had 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of  moisture  in the
past week, rain has been about half of normal in the past month.
Three percent of the oilseed  harvest  was complete, behind the
average pace of 9 percent.  “The condition of soybean plants remained unchanged week-on-week,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said in a report e-mailed today. “This, coupled with
the uncertainty over whether the soybean-acreage figures stated
so far are actually correct or whether the acreage may in fact
be smaller after all, is lending support to soybean prices.”  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.6 percent to
$13.16 a bushel at 9:51 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade,
after falling 3 percent in the previous three sessions. Prices
earlier touched $13.0525, the lowest for a most-active contract
since Aug. 23.  While the USDA expects this year’s harvest to be 4.4
percent larger than last year, when crops were hurt by the worst
drought since the 1930s, the agency cut its forecast on Sept. 12
and in August as  drought  conditions expanded in parts of the
Midwest.  Excess rain in April and May also prevented some fieldwork,
with crop-insurance claims filed for 1.69 million acres of
unplanted land intended for soybeans, compared with 159,579
acres last year, USDA data show.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.9 percent to
$4.4925 a bushel on the CBOT. Fifty-five percent of the  crop  was
in good or excellent condition as of Sept. 22, up from 53
percent a week earlier, the USDA said yesterday.  Wheat futures for December delivery dropped 0.5 percent to
$6.5025 a bushel in  Chicago . Planting of winter varieties rose
to 23 percent complete on Sept. 22, up from 12 percent a week
earlier, USDA data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
