Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester
City advanced to the fourth round of English soccer’s League Cup
with routs, while Fulham rallied to inflict Everton’s first
defeat of the season.  Jermain Defoe scored twice for Spurs last night with
Paulinho and Nacer Chadli adding goals in a 4-0 victory at
fellow Premier League team Aston Villa. Stevan Jovetic got his
first goals for City in a 5-0 home win against Wigan Athletic.  Hull City, Southampton and Sunderland will also take their
place in today’s round of 16 draw in  England ’s second-tier cup
competition after winning home games against lower-league
opposition. Fernando Torres scored one and set up the other goal
in Chelsea’s 2-0 win at Swindon, which plays in the third-tier
League One. Norwich City won 3-2 at Watford.  In  London , Fulham fell behind to Steven Naismith’s 12th-minute opener before Dimitar Berbatov and Darren Bent got
second-half goals to send Roberto Martinez to his first loss as
Everton manager. It was Fulham’s first win at its Craven Cottage
stadium since April 1.  Ricardo Vaz Te’s 88th-minute header took West Ham United
past Cardiff City 3-2 after the Welsh club had fought back from
2-0 down in an all-Premier League matchup.  Swansea City continues its title defense at Birmingham City
in one of the five remaining third-round matches today, when
Manchester United hosts record eight-time champion Liverpool.
The fourth round is scheduled for the week commencing Oct. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
