French pharmaceutical company Les
Laboratoires Servier offered to buy the rest of  Hungary ’s Egis
Nyrt. it doesn’t own for 107 billion forint ($483 million) and
pull the stock from the Budapest Stock Exchange.  Servier, which already controls 51 percent of the Budapest-based drugmaker, offered 28,000 forint per share for all
outstanding shares, a 33 percent premium over yesterday’s
closing price, according to a statement posted on the Budapest
bourse’s  website  today. Trading in Egis shares was suspended.  Egis, with the fifth-largest market capitalization on the
exchange, may drop out of the Budapest bourse because it doesn’t
need equity financing as a publicly traded company, Pascal
Touchon, Servier’s director of business development, said in an
interview posted on the company’s  website .  “The offer price is final and Servier will not increase
the price outlined in the public offer,” Touchon said, adding
that Servier isn’t planning any post-bids after the acceptance
period ends, regardless of the original bid’s outcome.  Egis, which is active in central and eastern  Europe 
including  Russia , has increasingly relied on exports for sales
growth as Hungary’s government curbed drug spending to rein in
the  budget deficit .  Egis  shares  fell 1 percent to 21,050 forint yesterday,
pushing this quarter’s decline to 3.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
