Kenyan coffee prices fell at an
auction today following three weeks of gains on reduced quality
and lower demand.  The average price for all coffee sold dropped 5.7 percent
to $168.30 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $178.43 last
week, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said by e-mail. The benchmark
AA grade declined 2.6 percent to an average $292.61 a bag.  “The quality was a bit lower and not many people were
active in the market,” Mansukh Shah, a coffee trader at
Nairobi-based Alanwood Ltd., said by phone without providing
further details.  Sales rose 4.1 percent to 3,465 bags worth $714,259 from
3,330 bags valued at $728,204 last week. Supplies fell 8.3
percent to 10,836 bags.  Following are details of today’s auction in dollars a bag.  To contact the reporter on this story:
