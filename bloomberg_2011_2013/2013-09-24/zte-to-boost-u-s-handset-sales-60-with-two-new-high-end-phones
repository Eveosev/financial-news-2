ZTE Corp. (763) ,  China ’s second-biggest
maker of equipment for phone networks, plans to boost U.S.
handset sales by 60 percent this year, aided by the release of
two new high-end smartphones.  Revenue from ZTE’s handsets in the U.S. market will climb
to $1.6 billion this year from $1 billion in 2012, spokesman
David Dai told reporters in Beijing today.  ZTE, which became one of the world’s top five smartphone
vendors with low-cost handsets such as the 799  yuan  ($131) U807N
in China, is looking to the U.S. for growth as it expands sales
of higher-priced devices. The Shenzhen-based company will
release the Grand S and Nubia smartphones in the U.S. next
month, with both costing about $450, Dai said.  Samsung Electronics Co. was the world’s biggest smartphone
seller in the second quarter with a 30.4 percent share,
according to International Data Corp. It’s followed by  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  with 13.1 percent,  LG Electronics Inc. (066570)  with 5.1 percent,
 Lenovo Group Ltd. (992)  with 4.7 percent, and ZTE with 4.2 percent.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
