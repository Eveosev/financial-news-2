At 11 p.m., long after most Paris
shops have closed for the evening, Sephora on the Champs-Elysees
is still bustling with customers browsing for cosmetics and
perfume. That puts the shop in violation of  France ’s labor laws.  A Paris court ruled yesterday that the Sephora store must
close no later than 9 p.m. because of a law that bans late-night
working hours at most businesses. Sephora, owned by  LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the world’s largest luxury-goods
maker, said it will comply with the ruling and submit an appeal.  Unions had complained that Sephora was violating the law by
keeping the store open until midnight on weekdays and 1 a.m. on
weekends. Fifty-eight of the store’s 200 employees volunteer to
work nights in exchange for extra pay,  Agence France-Presse 
reported. More than 50 Sephora employees attended a court
hearing to support the company’s position.  “We’ve been stabbed” by the unions, Sephora saleswoman
Ines Sampiecro told AFP. A union representative contended that
Sephora had “blackmailed” employees into opposing the unions.  Sephora closes its other stores by 9 p.m. but keeps the
Champs-Elysées outlet open later because it’s in what the
company called an “exceptional tourist zone.” The store,
according to AFP, draws 6 million visitors a year and rings up
20 percent of its sales after 9 p.m.  The ruling could have implications for other businesses
that now keep their Champs-Elysees outlets open after 9 p.m.
They range from fast-fashion outlet H&M to watchmaker Swatch to
music and electronics retailer FNAC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
