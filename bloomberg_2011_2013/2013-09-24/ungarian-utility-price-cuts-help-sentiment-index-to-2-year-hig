Hungary’s economic-sentiment index
jumped to its strongest level in almost 30 months in September,
as consumer optimism surged in the wake of government mandated
utility-price cuts.  The index rose to minus 11.6, the best reading since April
2011, from minus 14.3 in August, the GKI research institute in
Budapest said in an e-mailed statement. Business confidence
increased to minus 4.8 from minus 6.3 in August, while the
consumer-confidence gauge rose to minus 31 from minus 36.9,
equaling its biggest monthly gain since May 2010.  Consumers said their capacity to save had improved, while
their financial situation and the possibility to purchase high-value durable goods was better, GKI said. All business sub-indexes except services showed improved confidence, it said.  Prime Minister  Viktor Orban , who faces elections next year,
has mandated a second round of cuts in regulated utility prices
in a bid to court voters, boost  consumer spending  and lower
inflation as the central bank continues to reduce its benchmark
rate to new lows. The economy will grow 0.7 percent this year
before expanding 2 percent in 2014, the government predicts.  GKI’s indexes are calculated as a balance of positive and
negative answers to questions about the outlook for the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
