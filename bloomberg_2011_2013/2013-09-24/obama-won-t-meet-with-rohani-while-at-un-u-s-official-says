President  Barack Obama  and Iranian
leader Hassan Rohani won’t meet while in  New York  for the  United
Nations General Assembly , according to White House officials.  While the U.S. was open to an informal exchange, such as a
handshake, the Iranians decided against such a display, citing
domestic political concerns, said the officals, who asked for
anonymity to describe the private discussions.  Both Obama and Rohani had indicated an interest in closing
a three decade rift between the two countries, through
statements over the past week.  In a UN address this morning, Obama embraced what he
described as Iran’s “more moderate course,” though he
cautioned that he wanted a substantive agreement to rein in
that country’s nuclear program.  “The roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I firmly
believe the diplomatic path must be tested,” he told dozens of
world leaders gathered for the annual meeting of the UN General
Assembly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
