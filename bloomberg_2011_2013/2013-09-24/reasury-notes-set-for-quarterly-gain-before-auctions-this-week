Treasury  10-year (USGG10YR)  note yields fell
to the lowest level in six weeks as investors bet the  Federal
Reserve  will remain accommodative as it awaits a pick-up in
economic growth, stoking demand for government debt.  Two-year note yields were about two basis points from a
six-week low before the U.S. sells $33 billion of the debt at an
auction today. Benchmark 10-year notes extended a third day of
gains after a gauge of consumer confidence fell this month. The
Fed last week maintained its policy of buying $85 billion of
debt a month to put downward pressure on borrowing costs,
causing investors to push back forecasts for when the central
bank will raise  interest rates .  “Momentum remains relatively constructive in the Treasury
market in the wake of the Fed’s decision not to taper,” said
 Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market is grinding a little
bit higher.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.65 percent at 11:53 a.m. in  New
York , based on Bloomberg Bond Trader data, after declining five
basis points in the previous two trading days. The yield is the
lowest since Aug. 13. The price of the 2.5 percent security due
in August 2023 added 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face value, to
98 22/32.  The two-year note  yielded  0.33 percent after dropping to
0.31 percent on Sept. 19, the lowest level since Aug. 13. The
yield reached 0.53 percent on Sept. 6, a more than two-year
high.  Long Bets  The Treasury also plans to sell $35 billion of five-year
notes tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year debt the next day.  The securities being sold today yielded 0.36 percent in
pre-auction trading, compared with 0.386 percent at a previous
auction on Aug. 27. Investors  bid  for 3.21 times the amount of
debt offered last month, versus the average of 3.40 times for
the last 10 of these monthly sales.  Indirect bidders  purchased
19.3 percent of the securities, the least since January.  Investors in  Treasuries (BUSY110)  were long this week, betting that
the prices of the securities will rise, according to a survey by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  proportion  of net longs remained steady at 8 percentage
points in the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan,
matching the position in the week ending Sept. 16. Outright
longs dropped to 19 percent, from 21 percent, while  outright
shorts dropped to 11 percent from 13 percent. Investors raised
neutral bets to 70 percent from 66 percent.  Debt Ceiling  There’s a “gradual acceptance by the market that the fed
will remain accommodative,’ said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at BNP Paribas SA, one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. ‘‘The market is going to be
grinding to lower yields over the next few months.’’  Treasuries due in one to 10 years have returned 0.1 percent
this quarter as of yesterday, based on the Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. U.S. government  securities  maturing in a decade and
longer dropped 2.9 percent.  The market for  U.S. government debt  has yet to react to any
potential impasse over raising the borrowing ceiling. Most
federal operations would come to a halt when the fiscal year
ends Sept. 30 if President  Barack Obama ’s administration and
lawmakers can’t agree on a funding plan.  Treasuries that mature on Oct. 15 yielded 0.035 percent,
from 0.037 percent two weeks ago. The rate on debt due Nov. 7
has held within two basis points of zero during the period.  Home Prices  Treasuries remained higher today as a report showed  home
prices  in 20 U.S. cities rose in the 12 months through July by
the most in more than seven years, helping boost owner equity.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
increased 12.4 percent from July 2012, matching the median
projection of 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg and the
biggest year-to-year advance since February 2006, a report from
the group showed today in New York.  The Conference Board’s index of U.S.  consumer confidence 
decreased to 79.7 in September from a revised 81.8 a month
earlier, data from the New York-based private research group
showed today. The Richmond Fed’s  manufacturing index  tumbled to
zero from 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
