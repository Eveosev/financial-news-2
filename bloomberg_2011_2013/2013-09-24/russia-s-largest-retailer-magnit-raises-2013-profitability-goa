OAO Magnit (MGNT) , Russia’s largest
retailer, increased its 2013 profitability target and said sales
growth will be at the top end of a forecast range.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization as a percentage of sales will be “in line” with
the previous year’s 10.6 percent, Krasnodar, southern Russia-based Magnit said today in a  statement.  The retailer had
previously forecast a margin of 9.7 percent to 10 percent.  Magnit, run and owned by billionaire Sergey Galitskiy, has
the highest Ebitda margin among publicly traded peers globally,
according to Sberbank CIB. The margin in the first half of 2013
was 10.1 percent of sales.  “The new guidance shows management’s confidence that the
company will continue its strong performance and accelerate it
in the fourth quarter,” Natalia Kolupaeva, an analyst at ZAO
Raiffeisenbank in Moscow, said by phone.  Sales this year will rise 29 percent to 30 percent, Magnit
said today, compared with previous guidance of 27 percent to 30
percent. For 2014, the retailer forecast revenue growth of 25
percent, in line with analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Magnit also said it plans capital spending of $1.7 billion
to $1.8 billion next year, at least as much as in 2013. It plans
to open 1,000  convenience stores , 80 hypermarkets and 350
cosmetics outlets next year.  Magnit fell 1.4 percent to $62 at 9:51 a.m. in  London ,
where the stock is traded. The company overtook  X5 Retail Group
NV (FIVE)  in March as Russia’s largest retailer by sales. Its market
value has increased by 54 percent this year to $29.3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
