  Airbus SAS (EAD) , the European maker of
commercial aircraft, predicted airlines will buy planes valued
at $4.4 trillion in the next two decades, driven by demand in
 India  and China and global growth among low-fare airlines.  Airlines will buy 29,220 planes to satisfy 4.7 percent in
annual traffic growth, Airbus said in its annual industry-wide
forecast today. The prediction, which includes 28,350 passenger
jets, is 3.6 percent higher than a year earlier.  Airbus, based in Toulouse in southern  France , fell behind
 Boeing Co. (BA)  last year in deliveries after leading the industry
every year since 2003. Both manufacturers are headed for record
shipments this year, with output for several aircraft types at a
peak as airlines from Asia to North America seek newer, more
fuel-efficient jets to cut costs.  “By 2032, Asia-Pacific will lead the world in traffic,
overtaking Europe and North America,” John Leahy, Airbus’s
chief salesman, said in a statement. “Today on average, a fifth
of the population of the  emerging markets  take a flight annually
and by 2032 this will swell to two thirds.”  The global fleet will grow to 36,560 aircraft from 17,740
by 2032, Airbus said. The total, which includes replacement of
10,400 existing passenger jets, compares with competitor
Boeing’s forecast for 35,280 planes valued at $4.8 trillion,
including 2,020 regional jets that Airbus does not count.  Some 36 percent of new passenger planes will go to the
Asia-Pacific region, with Europe taking 20 percent of planes
ahead of North America, which will be home to 19 percent of
forecast deliveries.  Indian Growth  The highest growth rate will be in India where domestic air
travel is set to advance almost 10 percent, with  China  and
 Brazil  due to see increases of about 7 percent, Airbus said.  Airbus raised its single-aisle forecast 3.8 percent to
20,242 planes. Those jets will make up 71 percent of deliveries,
as low-fare carriers increase their share of traffic to 21
percent from 17 percent over the period.  Twin-aisle models, excluding the largest four-engine
versions, will constitute 23 percent of passenger jet handovers,
Airbus predicted. The European aircraftmaker sees more expensive
wide-body aircraft equaling the size of the single-aisle market
by value, with both at $1.8 trillion.  Airbus, which flew its new A350 in June as it continues to
sell A330s, raised its wide-body forecast 4.3 percent where it
competes with Boeing’s popular 777 and the 787 Dreamliner.  One area where the two dominant planemakers continue to
differ is in the forecast for very large aircraft. Airbus
predicted that passenger aircraft demand in the segment will top
1,334 units, four aircraft more than last forecast year, or $519
billion in value, whereas Boeing estimates less than half that
amount, at 760 units, including dedicated freighters.  Airbus, which offers the A380 double-decker in competition
to Boeing’s 747-8, still has to book its first sale this year
after securing agreements from  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and leasing
company Doric to buy the plane.  To contact the reporter on this story:
