Heavy and Light Louisiana Sweet
crudes fell against the benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate on
speculation demand for prompt delivery is light amid refinery
upsets and maintenance.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium versus WTI slipped 20 cents
to $1.05 a barrel and Heavy Louisiana Sweet dropped 15 cents to
$1.50 over WTI at 3:47 p.m. in  New York , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It’s the second-to-last day for October
delivery.  Upsets at plants including Valero Energy Corp.’s Memphis,
 Tennessee , and Marathon Petroleum Corp.’s Galveston, Texas,
refineries may reduce demand while units are brought back
online.  “Refiners are down, and you are seeing the cash crudes get
a little bit heavier,” said Carl Larry, president of Oil
Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston. “They’re getting weighed
down. There’s not a lot of demand for the crudes right now.”  Southern Green Canyon strengthened by 75 cents to a
discount of $5.75 against WTI. Poseidon’s discount narrowed 45
cents to $3.80. Mars Blend strengthened 75 cents a barrel to a
discount of $2.75 to the benchmark.  The premium for  Thunder Horse , which has a lower sulfur
content than Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, gained 10
cents to a discount of 75 cents a barrel.  Bakken weakened by 50 cents to a discount of $7 a barrel
against WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
