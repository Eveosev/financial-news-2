A future U.K. Labour government
would require train companies to provide Wi-Fi for travelers as
part of their franchise agreements, said the party’s transport
spokeswoman, Maria Eagle.  “No more ripping people off with Internet charges, just
because you can’t afford to travel first-class,” Eagle told
delegates today at the opposition party’s annual conference in
Brighton, southern  England . “Isn’t it time that all trains had
Wi-Fi in the 21st century? So let’s require it in franchises.”  Tickets also would be simplified to remove confusion for
passengers, Eagle said. Liberal Democrat Rail Minister Norman Baker said last week that the government plans a trial starting
in 2015 on one route of a new system for long-distance tickets
in a bid to end situations where one-way fares can cost more
than a round trip.  Eagle also backed the building of a new rail line from
 London  to the north of England, in contrast to comments
yesterday by Labour’s Treasury spokesman,  Ed Balls , suggesting
that the project might be dropped if costs run out of control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
