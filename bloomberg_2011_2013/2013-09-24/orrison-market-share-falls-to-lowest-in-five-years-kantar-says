William Morrison Supermarkets Plc (MRW) ’s
share of the U.K. grocery market dropped to a five-year low this
month, indicating that a lack of convenience stores and an
online offering continue to weigh on business.  The retailer’s market share fell to 11.1 percent in the 12
weeks ended Sept. 16 from 11.4 percent a year earlier, according
to researcher Kantar Worldpanel. That’s the lowest since the 12
weeks ended Sept. 7, 2008, when the share was 11 percent.  Morrison misses 2 percentage points of sales growth by not
having an online presence or convenience stores, the two fastest
growing areas of the market, Chief Executive Officer Dalton Philips said Sept. 12. The grocer plans to start an Internet
grocery service in January and to have 100 convenience stores by
the end of this year, which it will seek to double in 2014.  “Strong performances by retailers at both ends of the
market pose a significant challenge for the big four
supermarkets,”  Kantar Worldpanel  said in the statement. A
polarization by shoppers toward discounters such as Aldi and
Lidl and the upscale Waitrose chain “is forcing the major
supermarkets to compete for an ever-smaller middle ground.”  Morrison’s sales rose 1.6 percent in the 12-week period,
down from 1.8 percent growth reported last month, Kantar said.  J Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  was the only one of the U.K.’s big four
grocers to gain market share from a year ago, with an increase
to 16.6 percent from 16.4 percent.  Tesco Plc (TSCO) , Britain’s largest
retailer, saw its share weaken to 30.2 percent from 30.9
percent, while the share of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s Asda dropped
to 17.3 percent from 17.6 percent, Kantar World Panel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
