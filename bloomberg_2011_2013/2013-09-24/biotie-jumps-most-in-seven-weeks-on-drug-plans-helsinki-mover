Biotie Therapies Oyj (BTH1V) , the drugmaker
that developed an anti-alcoholism drug with  H. Lundbeck A/S (LUN) ,
rose the most in more than seven weeks after announcing the
results of a review to maximize value from its products.  The shares rose as much as 5.9 percent, the biggest jump
since Aug. 5. The stock was up 2.9 percent at 35 euro cents as
of 1:31 p.m. in the Finnish capital. The volume of shares traded
was more than three times the three-month daily average.  “We now have a clear strategy for each of our current
products that we believe will allow us to enhance  shareholder
value ,” Chief Executive Officer Timo Veromaa said in a
statement today. “We will also utilize our relatively strong
financial position to identify new assets that will further
strengthen our portfolio and that we could potentially develop
all the way to the market.”  Biotie expects to exercise an option in the first half of
2014 to acquire Neurelis Inc. and its NRL-1 product, a
proprietary intranasal formulation of diazepam to help manage
epileptic seizures, according to the statement. The Turku,
Finland-based company is also in advanced talks to fund a mid-stage study of BTT-1023 to treat primary sclerosing cholangitis,
a rare disease of the liver in young adults.  The company also said it’s in advanced discussions on a
potential partnership for an experimental treatment for
 Alzheimer’s disease . Results of a study on treating cocaine
dependency with a drug called nepicastat are expected in about
two years, Biotie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
