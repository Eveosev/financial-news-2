Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  said it will sell a
new 1 billion-euro ($1.35 billion) bond as  Denmark ’s biggest
lender replaces a 2037 note it called last week after a spat
with  Standard & Poor’s .  The Tier 2 debt will be due 2023 with a coupon of 3.875
percent for the first five years, the Copenhagen-based bank said
late yesterday in a statement. In 2018, the coupon will be reset
and Danske then has the option of prepaying the bond at par.  Danske said Sept. 18 it will redeem the $1 billion 7.125
percent 2037 bond at above par after a rule change at S&P wiped
out the note’s equity content. Steen Blaafalk, Danske’s
treasurer, said Sept. 23 the bank had started talks with
investors to gauge their interest in a replacement and to decide
the yield, which would be “substantially lower” than the 2037
bond’s coupon.  “The bond loan forms part of Danske Bank’s ongoing
adjustment of its  capital structure  to future  capital
requirements  for European banks,” Danske said in today’s
statement. The new bond will be listed on the Irish Stock
Exchange.  Danske is working on its  capital structure  as older,
subordinated debt comes due and as the bank tries to reach a
capital target of 17 percent of risk-weighted assets. The bank
has said it intends to meet 4 percentage points of that target
with a combination of Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments. The lender
also faces a 2014 deadline to retire 24 billion kroner ($4.3
billion) in state-held hybrid debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
