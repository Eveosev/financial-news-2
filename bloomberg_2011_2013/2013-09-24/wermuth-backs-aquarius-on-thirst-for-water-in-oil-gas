Wermuth Asset Management GmbHâ€™s
Green Gateway Fund is helping back Aquarius Water Group, a Swiss
supplier of water systems for the oil and gas industry.  Green Gateway invested 6.5 million-euros ($8.8 million) in
the Zug, Switzerland-based company, Wermuth said today in an e-mailed statement. Aquarius makes technologies and systems to
handle water and wastewater such as cooling supplies or seawater
for injection as well as industrial wastewater, according to
Mainz, Germany-based Wermuth.  As nations seek to boost oil output from unconventional
sources such as oil sands and gas from shale deposits to curb
imports, demand for technologies that efficiently treat or use
water required in their operations is increasing. Green Gateway,
with 110 million euros in commitments and a 250 million-euro
target, invests in energy and resource-efficiency companies,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
