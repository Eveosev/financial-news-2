The San Francisco 49ers placed Pro
Bowl defensive end Aldon Smith on the their reserve, non-football injury list as he takes an indefinite leave after a
second alcohol-related arrest.  Smith, who was second in the NFL with 19 1/2 sacks last
season, was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence
in San Jose,  California , on Sept. 20, police said. He had a
previous DUI arrest in Miami Beach in 2012 and was charged with
reckless driving after completing a program for first-time DUI
offenders.  “I am sorry that I have affected my team, my family and
the organization,” Smith told reporters. “I will do everything
in my power to handle this situation the best way possible. I
appreciate the support of the 49ers and our fans.”  Smith, 23, will enter a rehabilitation facility for
substance-abuse treatment, NBC Sports reported two days ago
after Smith played every defensive snap in the 49ers’ 27-7 home
loss to the Indianapolis Colts.  Trent Baalke, the 49ers’ general manager, said Smith’s
leave is a “personal matter.”  “The 49ers’ organization both respects and supports
Aldon’s decision and commends him for taking responsibility for
his actions,” Baalke said. “The long-term well-being of our
players is paramount and we will stand by Aldon as he works
toward addressing this issue. Due to the private nature of the
matter, we will have no further comment.”  Dan Skuta and Corey Lemonier will help replace Smith in
this week’s Sept. 26 game against the St. Louis Rams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
