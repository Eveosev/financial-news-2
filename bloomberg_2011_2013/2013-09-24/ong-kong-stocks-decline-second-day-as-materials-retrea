Hong Kong  stocks  slid a second day,
with the equity benchmark heading for its biggest decline in
four weeks, as Chinese property companies and raw material
producers fell.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , the biggest mainland
developer traded in Hong Kong, slipped 1.9 percent on
speculation the government will accelerate property-tax trials.
Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s largest producer of the metal,
dropped 1.7 percent as copper futures headed for a three-day
loss. Cnooc Ltd., the nation’s top offshore oil producer, lost
1.5 percent as oil traded near a six-week low.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  declined 0.8 percent to 23,179.04 at
the close, with three shares falling for each that gained on the
50-member gauge. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) , also
known as the H-share index, dropped 1.1 percent to 10,599.15.  “We’ve had a rally the past three months amid positive
economic data from China,” said  Ben Kwong , Hong Kong-based
chief operating officer at KGI Asia Ltd. “We need to have a
consolidation. The market is using the ongoing discussions about
the U.S. debt ceiling and Fed tapering as an excuse to sell.”  The Hang Seng Index climbed 6.7 percent this month amid
signs of mainland economic recovery and after the  Federal
Reserve  unexpectedly refrained from cutting stimulus. The equity
benchmark traded at 11.1 times estimated earnings, compared with
15.4 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday. The H-share
index entered a bull market this month after rebounding more
than 20 percent from a June low.  Developers Slide  Chinese developers declined amid concern the government
will introduce further measures to cool the real estate market.
There’s increased possibility of harsher curbs as  home prices 
are increasing again, David Cui, an analyst at Bank of America’s
Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note yesterday.  China will start a second round of property levy training
for people working in the taxation system next month, signaling
a possible acceleration of tax trials, the China Securities
Journal reported, citing unidentified people.  China Overseas Land dropped 1.9 percent to HK$23.45.  China
Resources Land Ltd. (1109)  sank 3.4 percent to HK$22.55. Guangzhou R&F
Properties Co. fell 1.7 percent to HK$12.58.  Futures on the S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent. The gauge lost 0.5
percent yesterday as financial shares slumped and investors
watched speeches from central bank officials for clues on
monetary policy. New York Fed President William C. Dudley and
the Atlanta Fed’s  Dennis Lockhart  said yesterday stimulus is
still needed, while Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher  said not
tapering $85 billion a month in bond purchases harmed the
central bank’s credibility.  Stimulus Tapering  The Fed is expected to wait until December before taking
the first steps in slowing stimulus, after Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  maintained the pace of asset purchases last week,
according to 24 of 41 economists surveyed Sept. 18-19 by
Bloomberg News.  Even as investors focus on the Fed’s policies, political
disagreements over funding and the debt limit are rising in
Washington. House Speaker  John Boehner  and his Republican caucus
are pushing the federal government closer to a shutdown over
funding and the debt limit, Democrats  Max Baucus  and  Patty
Murray  said in a letter to colleagues yesterday.  Raw-material producers and energy companies declined as
copper, aluminum and oil futures fell. Jiangxi Copper dropped
1.7 percent to HK$16.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the nation’s
biggest producer of the lightweight metal, slid 1.8 percent to
HK$2.74. Cnooc decreased 1.5 percent to HK$15.80.  Tencent Slides  Tencent Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest Internet company,
slipped 1.6 percent to HK$402.60 after Alibaba Group Holdings
Ltd. introduced an instant-messaging app to compete against
Tencent’s WeChat in the world’s No. 1 smartphone market.  Sunny Optical Technology Group Co. (2382) , a supplier of mobile-phone camera lenses to companies including Samsung Electronics
Co. and Nokia Oyj, slid 3.6 percent to HK$8.13. The company
today said it plans to raise net proceeds of HK$770 million ($99
million), selling 97 million shares at HK$8.06 to Sun Xu Ltd.,
its biggest shareholder.  Hong Kong Parkview Group Ltd. tumbled 8 percent to HK$3.68.
The real estate investor said it may sell as many as 2.3 billion
shares to raise funds to pay for the purchase of commercial
properties worth HK$14.2 billion from parent Cofco Corp.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index  fell 0.7 percent to 23,193.
The HSI Volatility Index slid 1.2 percent to 16.46, indicating
traders expect the benchmark equity index to swing 4.7 percent
in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
