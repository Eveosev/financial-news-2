The land of celebrities, glorious weather, high-end homes and endless drama provides the perfect setting for a reality TV show. Bravo’s  “Million Dollar Listing: Los Angeles”  is now in its sixth season, and gauging by the success of the show — and its real estate agent stars — it doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. Madison Hildebrand has been on the show for its entire run — through the downturn of the market to its slow recovery — and despite the roller coaster of the real estate market and occasional drama with cast members, he’s enjoyed every minute. Hildebrand took a few moments out of his busy day to talk real estate and behind the scenes of the popular show. Zillow:  Why do you think the show is successful in L.A.? Hildebrand:  There are so many reasons. It is the land of celebrities, wild personalities, free spirits and outrageous real estate and architecture. Zillow:  You’ve been on the show for quite awhile. How has it changed through the different seasons? Hildebrand:  I’ve been on for six years, so the cameras have captured the market go from great to some of the worst of times … to rebounding. It’s been a roller coaster of emotions as my clients have experienced the economic impact. As a real estate agent, I have to personally deal with those emotions, and my job is a lot more fun when people are making money and not losing money. Hildebrand:  A month? In my dreams! Roughly it’s 10 months of filming and a three-month air cycle … so it has essentially been a part of my day-to-day for six years of my life. I essentially have two real careers. Zillow:  Have you had to deal with privacy concerns of clients or homeowners during filming? Hildebrand:  Of course. Some clients won’t go on TV, so they have representatives on their behalf. Others refuse all together as they are A-list celebrities. And then some relish and love being in the spotlight. Zillow:  And of course, we all want to know how real is the show? Hildebrand:  I’m a genuine and authentic person. The story lines are real, and Bravo is big on keeping it that way. Hildebrand is an agent with  Coldwell Banker Previews International . “Million Dollar Listing: Los Angeles” airs at 9 p.m. ET Wednesdays on Bravo.
