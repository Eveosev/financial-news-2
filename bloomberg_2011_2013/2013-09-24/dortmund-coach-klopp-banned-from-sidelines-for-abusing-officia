Borussia Dortmund soccer coach
Juergen Klopp was given a one-match sideline ban for verbally
abusing the fourth match official during last week’s  Champions
League  loss at Napoli.  European soccer’s governing body  UEFA  issued the sanction
after Klopp shouted at Portugal’s Venancio Tome following a
Napoli goal scored when Dortmund defender Neven Subotic was
waiting to return to the field. Klopp was sent to the stands and
Dortmund went on to lose 2-1, hampered by goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller’s red card just before halftime.  The German coach will now have to watch his team’s next
Champions League group match against Marseille from the stands
in Dortmund on Oct. 1.  UEFA’s disciplinary commission will meet the following day
to decide whether to suspend him for a further match or issue a
fine.  Klopp, 46, guided Dortmund to two Bundesliga titles since
taking over as manager in 2008. He also led the team to last
season’s Champions League final where it lost to  Bayern Munich .  To contact the reporter on this story:
