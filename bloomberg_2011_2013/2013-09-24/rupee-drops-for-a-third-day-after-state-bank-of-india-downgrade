India ’s rupee fell for a third day,
the longest losing streak in almost a month, after Moody’s
Investors Service downgraded the nation’s largest lender.  State Bank of India (SBIN) ’s debt rating was cut to Baa3 from Baa2
yesterday by Moody’s, which also changed the outlook on the D+
financial strength ranking to negative from stable, citing a
slowdown in the economy and the need for a capital injection
from the government. Credit-default swaps insuring SBI bonds
against non-payment for five years climbed 20 basis points
yesterday, the most since Aug. 19, to 282, CMA prices show.  “The SBI downgrade may affect India through the equity
channel as outflows will affect the rupee,” said  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in  Singapore . “Some
investors also perceive porous linkages between SBI and the
sovereign,” renewing concern that India’s credit rating may be
downgraded, he said.  The rupee weakened 0.1 percent to 62.6550 per dollar as of
10:12 a.m. in Mumbai, after falling as much as 0.5 percent to
62.9075, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 10 basis
points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 16.31 percent.  Standard & Poor’s  reiterated on Sept. 3 it sees more than a
one-in-three chance that India’s debt rating will be cut within
two years.  The central bank unexpectedly raised benchmark interest
rates on Sept. 20 and scaled back earlier measures meant to
support the currency, which plunged 12 percent this year,  Asia ’s
second-worst performance after the Indonesian rupiah. The rupee
reached a record low of 68.845 per dollar on Aug. 28.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards fell 0.1 percent to
64.17 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts dropped 0.2 percent to 64.50. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
