Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  said it’s
interested in securing a so-called streaming contract for future
output of precious metals from Glencore Xstrata Plc’s Las Bambas
copper mine in Peru.  The Vancouver-based company, which helps miners pay for
projects in exchange for a discount on their future silver and
gold output, has had discussions with other parties about a
streaming deal at Las Bambas, Silver Wheaton Chief Executive
Officer Randy Smallwood said today on the sidelines of the
Denver Gold Forum.  “About 5 percent of the revenue from Las Bambas comes from
gold and silver, from precious metals, and it’s definitely a
project that’s got healthy margins,” Smallwood said. “We think
that a streaming contract would add a lot of value to the sales
process.”  Glencore (GLEN) , based in Baar,  Switzerland , is selling the mine
as part of an agreement to win Chinese regulatory approval for
its $29 billion takeover of Xstrata Plc this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
