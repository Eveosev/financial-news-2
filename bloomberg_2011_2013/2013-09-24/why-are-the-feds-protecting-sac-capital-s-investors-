Apparently  SAC Capital Advisors have  "reached out to prosecutors in New York to say that SAC founder Steven Cohen is interested in settling the civil and criminal cases against him and his company" for fines in the neighborhood of $1 billion.  This makes sense, since $1 billion is (for Cohen!) rather less than "everything," but if you've been following this story closely you might remember that time (March!) when SAC  reached a $600 million settlement  with the SEC to put an end to its insider-trading-investigation troubles. That worked for four whole months. Then the SEC  sued Cohen in July , and a week later the Justice Department  brought a criminal case against SAC . One possible takeaway here is that SAC overestimates, or the investigators underestimate, the binding effect of settlements. I predict a billion-dollar settlement followed by new charges by Christmas. SAC investigations aren't ending until everyone now at the SEC retires. The weirdest part about this may be that, according to Sheelah Kolhatkar at Bloomberg Businessweek, "One of the factors being considered in determining financial penalties is the desire to inflict monetary pain on Cohen personally without damaging other parties, such as his investors." I mean, wait, that isn't weird at all: Cohen, if you believe the charges, ran a business built on crime, hiring accomplished insider traders from elsewhere and fostering a supportive environment in which they could develop their insider-trading and nodding-and-winking skills. Also, he's worth a gazillion dollars. Meanwhile SAC's outside investors didn't do anything wrong, and many of them are* pensions and endowments and other sympathetic sorts. So it makes sense that everyone would want to protect them: that prosecutors would want to negotiate a settlement that doesn't punish them, and that  SAC would indemnify investors  so that the management company (owned by Cohen) rather than investors would pay any fines.  On the other hand!  Here you can read  Andrew Ross Sorkin's column about how JPMorgan's gazillion dollars in settlements for its endless list of naughtiness all comes out of shareholders' pockets: Sure! The theory behind fining a corporation -- meaning its shareholders -- for its employees' misdeeds is … well, it's a dumb theory, I guess? I mean it goes something like: You get the sense that a lot of securities regulation was designed for frictionless systems. Why, yes, these fines will give your grandmother who owns 10 shares of JPMorgan Chase stock an incentive to make sure that  Julien Grout is properly supervised . But, um. Those shareholders tend to be passive, dispersed and limited in their supervisory power by corporate law. Your grandma had no chance against Grout, and frankly BlackRock (with 6.43 percent of JPMorgan), Vanguard (4.75 percent), State Street (4.6) et al don't have much more chance either. Remember how a lot of JPMorgan shareholders wanted Jamie Dimon to stop being chairman, and he  just said no ? Meanwhile though let us talk about SAC Capital. I assert: Did people invest with SAC  because  they figured SAC was probably insider trading on their behalf and they could plausibly deny that they knew about it? Oh I don't know, maybe, maybe not. (Certainly  some people  invested with Bernie Madoff because they figured he was front-running on their behalf; illegality is not a strict deal-breaker.) Did people invest in JPMorgan stock because they think that traders in JPMorgan's chief investment would make large undisclosed bets in credit derivatives and then fraudulently mis-mark those bets in order to conceal losses? I'm gonna go with a confident "no" on that one. So why punish the JPMorgan shareholders, over and over again, while leaving the SAC investors alone? * Were. Most of the outside money  is gone now , though some remains. Presumably illicitly obtained money already paid out to cashed-out investors could be clawed back though. ** Though it may take them a while. Public shareholders can't pull their money. I mean, they can sell their shares if they think the company is bad. But that doesn't punish the company directly (it might drive the stock price down, but it's not like the company has to come up with cash to redeem them).
