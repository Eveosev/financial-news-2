Gold fell for the third straight
session on concern that the  Federal Reserve  will slow the pace
of U.S. fiscal stimulus, eroding demand for the metal as a store
of value.  Fed Bank of St. Louis President  James Bullard  said on Sept.
20 that tapering may start in October after the U.S. central
bank unexpectedly refrained last week from reducing monthly bond
purchases of $85 billion. Twenty-four of 41 economists surveyed
by  Bloomberg News  last week said the Fed will scale back
stimulus in December.  “It’s clear that tapering will begin over the next few
months, and that makes gold less precious,”  Adam Klopfenstein ,
a senior market strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to
close at $1,316.30 an ounce at 1:47 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal dropped 3.1 percent in the previous two
sessions.  Futures have slumped 21 percent this year after some
investors lost faith in the metal as an alternative investment
amid a U.S. equity rally and low inflation.  Gold surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed pumped more than $2 trillion into the
financial system by purchasing debt.  Silver futures for December delivery declined 1.2 percent
to $21.586 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 0.5 percent to $1,418.80 an ounce. Trading
almost doubled compared with the average in the past 100 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Palladium futures for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to
$720 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
