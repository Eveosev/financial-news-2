U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Mary Jo White said the agency’s enforcement
program will be “bold, unrelenting, but fair” in pursuing
wrongdoing by companies on  Wall Street  and elsewhere.  “For the SEC, no company, no financial institution is too
big to charge,” White said at the Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit
in  New York  today. “If the evidence is there, and you should
very aggressively pursue the evidence as far up in the chain as
it will go, then you proceed.”  White, who took the SEC’s helm in April, has shifted the
agency’s policy of settling cases without requiring admissions
of wrongdoing. If the change leads to more litigation, White
said, she’s confident the agency can prevail at trial.  It’s important that the SEC’s enforcement program cut
across all market participants, White said in the interview with
Bloomberg Television’s  Peter Cook .  “Be everywhere you can be,” White said. “You always have
to attend to making sure Wall Street and other market
participants are getting a sufficiently strong message.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
