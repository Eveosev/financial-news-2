Israeli benchmark  government bonds 
rose for the third day, pushing yields to a six-week low, after
the  Bank of Israel  unexpectedly lowered borrowing costs to boost
the nation’s export-driven economy.  The yield on the 4.25 percent notes due in March 2023
dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.77
percent as of 12:12 p.m. in Tel Aviv, the lowest level since
Aug. 14 on a closing basis. One-year interest rate swaps, an
indicator of investor expectations for rates over the period,
retreated four basis points to 1.03 percent.  Bank of Israel, led by acting Governor Karnit Flug since
 Stanley Fischer  left three months ago, yesterday cut its base
lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 1 percent,
the lowest in almost four years. Only one of the 18 economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg predicted the change. The bank said the
gaining shekel and a stagnation in exports, the main engine of
growth in the past decade, triggered the decision. Exports will
probably drop 1.1 percent in 2013, the bank’s forecasts show.  “The central bank sent a clear message that the strong
shekel and exports are a concern for the economy,” Yshai Shilo,
a fixed-income broker at Tel Aviv-based I.B.I.- Israel  Brokerage
& Investments, said by phone. “We don’t expect another rate cut
this year, but we could see further easing in the next six
months if there is a deterioration in economic data.”  Shekel Rally  The shekel on Sept. 18 strengthened to the highest since
August 2011 after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would refrain
from reducing the $85 billion pace of monthly bond buying, as it
needs to see more signs of a lasting improvement in the economy.
The currency, which was little changed today, has rallied 5.4
percent this year, the most among 31 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The Bank of Israel under Fischer had gradually lowered the
benchmark rate from 3.25 percent since 2011, including twice in
May, to combat the shekel’s rally. About 40 percent of Israel’s
economy is derived from exports to markets including the U.S.
and  Europe . The pace of gross domestic product growth is
expected to slow to 3.4 percent in 2014 from 3.6 percent this
year, according to a Bank of Israel forecast released yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
