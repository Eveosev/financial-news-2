Kenyan shares declined for a second
day as the country’s security forces battled to end a siege by
Islamist militants of an upscale mall in the capital, Nairobi,
that left 62 people dead.  The FTSE NSE 25 Index dropped 0.3 percent to 163.82 by
11:13 a.m. and has now dropped 0.5 percent this week, the
biggest two-day decline since Sept. 2. The number of shares
traded on the Nairobi Securities Exchange fell to about 14
million yesterday from 28 million in the previous session as
investors awaited the outcome to the crisis. The shilling was
little changed at 87.50 per dollar.  “We expect depressed trading in today’s session with
limited activity from local investors who will be reading the
national mood,” Ted Macharia, an analyst at Nairobi-based AIB
Capital Ltd., said in an e-mailed note.  Kenyan security forces killed at least six gunmen and freed
an unknown number of hostages after fighting as many as 15
Islamist militants who attacked the mall on Sept. 21. Al-Shabaab, a Somalia-based militia that is affiliated with al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the raid, which is the worst
attack in  Kenya  since the U.S. Embassy bombings in August 1998
that killed 213 people.  Trade on Kenya’s financial markets is “cautious,” Joshua
Anene, a trader at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd.,
said by phone. The shilling may be boosted by the Kenyan central
bank’s sale of as much as 20 billion shillings ($229 million) of
12-year infrastructure bonds that ends today, he said. Kenya
last auctioned the infrastructure bonds in February 2012, when
11.6 billion shillings were sold at 16.64 percent, according to
the bank.  The central bank will also offer 3 billion shillings each
of 182- and 364-day Treasury bills tomorrow. The yield on 364-day notes fell to 10.413 percent on Sept. 18 from 10.756 percent
a week earlier, while the yield for the 182-day securities fell
to 9.694 percent from 10.089 percent over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
