Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY) ’s investment
banking chief Zafrul Aziz resigned yesterday and will join  CIMB
Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) ,  Malaysia ’s second-largest bank, said two
people with knowledge of the matter.  Zafrul will become a deputy chief executive officer and
head of investment banking at CIMB, one of the people said,
asking not to be named because the matter is private. Kuala
Lumpur-based Maybank, the nation’s biggest lender, plans to
release a statement as soon as today, the other person said.  Zafrul was CEO of Maybank Investment Bank Bhd. and Maybank
Kim Eng Holdings Ltd. as well as acting global banking head at
parent Maybank. The Straits Times reported the resignation
earlier today.  Eliza Mohamed, head of corporate affairs for Maybank in
Kuala Lumpur, and Josandi Thor, a spokeswoman at CIMB, didn’t
immediately respond to requests for comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
