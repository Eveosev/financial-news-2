Steel reinforcement-bar futures
fell in Shanghai after Premier  Li Keqiang  said the government
has chosen steady  monetary policy , damping speculation for more
economic stimulus.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.4 percent to 3,641 yuan ($595) a metric ton at
10:49 a.m. local time. Futures have lost 2.9 percent this month.  China has also chosen not to expand the fiscal deficit,
even as the nation has faces economic pressure, Li said,
according to a statement posted on the central government’s
website, dated yesterday. Rebar inventory in China rose 1.9
percent last week from the period through Sept. 13 as demand
slowed, according to a report by Beijing Cifco Futures Co.  “There is little support from the policy front, and
physical demand shows no sign of recovery,” said Xia Junyan, an
analyst at Wanda Futures Co., in Shanghai.  The average spot price of rebar fell 0.3 percent to 3,516
 yuan  a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port
rose 0.5 percent to $132.4 yuan a dry ton yesterday, according
