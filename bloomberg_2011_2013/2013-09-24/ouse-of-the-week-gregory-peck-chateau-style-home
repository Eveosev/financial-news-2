CORRECTION 9/25/13:  This post has been updated to clarify that this home was owned by Gregory Peck’s wife. REVISED POST: 539 S Mapleton Dr, Los Angeles, CA For sale: $24.995 million This French chateau-style home was the residence of Hollywood legend Gregory Peck’s wife, Veronique, who passed away in 2012. The palatial estate-owned Holmby Hills residence was built in 1932 and was purchased by Veronique Peck after Gregory’s death in 2003, according to listing  agent Jade Mills  of  Coldwell Banker Previews International . “[The house] is almost like being far out in the country on your own 1.3 acres of secluded paradise,” Mills said. “However, you’re only minutes from the city’s best shops, restaurants and hot spots. I absolutely love showing this property. It’s my 45 minutes of tranquility during a busy day.” Measuring 9,000 square feet, the estate has 7 bedrooms, 9 bathrooms and a mix of formal and casual living spaces, all with large windows opening out to the landscaped, “park-like” grounds and pool. The master suite features a terrace, fireplace, his-and-her baths, dressing rooms and walk-in closets. Best known for his role as Atticus Finch in the classic “To Kill a Mockingbird,” for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, Peck is recognized as one of the best film actors of his time. He passed away in 2003. The monthly cost of a home with such cinematic history? Using a  mortgage calculator , the monthly payment on the Peck estate would be $100,641, assuming a 20 percent down payment on a 30-year mortgage.
