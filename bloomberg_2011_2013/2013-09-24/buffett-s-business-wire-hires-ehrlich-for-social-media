Business Wire, the unit of  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  that distributes press
releases, rehired Serena Ehrlich to bolster social-media
offerings as more clients turn to alternative outlets.  Ehrlich joins from mobile marketer Mogreet and has the
newly created role of director of social and evolving media, the
unit of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire said today in a
statement. She’ll oversee a blog and Twitter feed.  “Business Wire continues to create and evolve platforms
for professional communicators to reach their target audiences
in meaningful and measurable ways,” Tom Becktold, senior vice
president of marketing at the company, said in the statement.
“Adding Serena to our team helps us to put those changes into
context for our members as they develop content that is
platform- and audience-appropriate.”  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in April
that it would permit companies to distribute financial
information through social media websites such as those run by
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  and Twitter Inc. as long as investors have been
told in advance where to look. Business Wire Chief Executive
Officer Cathy Baron Tamraz has criticized the stance and said
that social media can be a part of  investor relations , rather
than the core.  Ehrlich, a graduate of  Brandeis University , worked as a
regional manager for Business Wire in Dallas, according to a
2002 statement from the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
