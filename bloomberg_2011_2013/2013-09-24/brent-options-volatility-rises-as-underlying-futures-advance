Crude options volatility for Brent
oil rose as the underlying futures advanced.  At-the-money volatility for November Brent options, a
measure of expected futures swings and a key gauge of value, was
20.62 percent at 3:43 p.m., up from 20.06 percent yesterday.  Brent for November settlement gained 48 cents, or 0.4
percent to settle at $108.64 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark traded at a
$5.51 premium to WTI, the widest spread since Sept. 6.  West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery fell 46
cents to $103.13 a barrel, the lowest settlement since July 30.
Crude declined on speculation that U.S.-Iranian relations are
thawing and as the threat of an American military strike on
Syria recedes.  “The market is going to be focused on any signs that there
will be the beginning of the end on sanctions to Iranian oil
exports, which would add to world supplies,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Calls accounted for 56 percent of electronic trading volume
in WTI options today. November $100 puts were the most active,
unchanged at 97 cents on volume of 4,255 contracts at 3:52 p.m.
Next-most active were November $115 calls, which dropped 1 cent
to 6 cents on volume of 3,043 contracts.  In the previous session, calls accounted for 52 percent of
the 93,643 lots traded.  November $100 puts were most active, with 6,155 contracts
changing hands as they rose 24 cents to 97 cents a barrel. March
$115 calls were next, dropping 11 cents to 74 cents on volume of
5,000 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 42,328
contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 40,511 lots and
December $100 calls with 32,741.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
