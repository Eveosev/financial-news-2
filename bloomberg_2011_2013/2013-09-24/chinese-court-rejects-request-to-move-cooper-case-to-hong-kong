A Chinese court rejected a request
to relocate the legal dispute between  Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. (CTB) 
and its China partner to Hong Kong, a court official said.  The Weihai Intermediate People’s Court relayed the decision
to the companies via mail, said a court official, who asked not
to be identified because of court rules. An official at
Chengshan Group Co., the Chinese partner, said the company
received the letter on Sept. 22. Anne Roman, a spokesman at
Cooper, didn’t respond to an e-mail outside of office hours.  In July, Chengshan Group sought the dissolution of its
venture with Cooper, saying the U.S. partner’s planned $2.5
billion sale to  India ’s  Apollo Tyres Ltd. (APTY)  would undermine the
Chinese venture’s operations. Cooper has said the litigation
lacks merit.  The Chinese venture, which requested the move and is
majority owned by Cooper, has 10 days after receiving the
court’s notice to appeal, according to the court official.  The court in Weihai, located in the eastern Chinese
province of Shandong, earlier this month pushed back a hearing
on the case that was set for yesterday to an undetermined date.  Apollo spokesman Rohit Sharan didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment.  Dealreporter reported earlier on the court decision.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
