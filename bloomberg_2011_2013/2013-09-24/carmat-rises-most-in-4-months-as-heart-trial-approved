Carmat SAS (ALCAR)  soared the most in four
months in Paris trading after winning regulatory approval to
test its artificial heart in four patients in  France .  Carmat climbed 20 percent to 134.49 euros at 10:06 a.m.
local time, giving the company a market value of 560 million
euros ($756 million). The stock gained as much as 28 percent,
the biggest intraday advance since May 14.  France’s National Medicine Security Agency authorized
Carmat to implant the heart in four patients in three hospitals,
the company, based in Velizy-Villacoublay, France, said in a
statement late yesterday.  “Now we have passed this milestone, we will be able to
fully focus on the success of the clinical phase in France and
in other countries,” said Alain Carpentier, Carmat’s co-founder
and scientific director.  Delays in winning approval to test the heart in France
prompted the company to announce in May that it would begin
trials in  Belgium ,  Poland , Saudi Arabia and Slovenia. The
implantable organ is designed to help patients with terminal
heart failure who can’t get a human heart for a transplant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
