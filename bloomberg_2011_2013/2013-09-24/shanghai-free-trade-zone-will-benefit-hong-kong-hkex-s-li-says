Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing
Ltd.’s Chief Executive Officer Charles Li said the planned
 Shanghai  free-trade zone will be benefit Hong Kong because it
shows China is speeding up liberalization.  “If the policies we’ve known can be implemented, it will
be an important milestone for China’s opening up,” Li told
reporters in Hong Kong today. “The zone will create a bigger
pie” of which Hong Kong’s slice will also grow, he said.  China’s State Council in July approved the country’s first
free-trade zone, which may allow freer  yuan  convertibility,
liberalize interest rates and relax restrictions on foreign
investment.  Li Ka-shing , Asia’s richest man, said Sept. 17 Hong
Kong needs to raise its competitiveness if it wants to avoid
losing to Shanghai.  A draft plan seen by Bloomberg News shows the zone, which
covers 29 square kilometers (11.2 square miles) of the Pudong
district, may liberalize 19 industries from banking to shipping
and allow freer currency convertibility. The government hasn’t
published any details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
