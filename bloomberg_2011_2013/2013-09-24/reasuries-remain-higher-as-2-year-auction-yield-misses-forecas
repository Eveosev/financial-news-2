Treasury 10-year note yields fell
to the lowest level in six weeks as investors bet the  Federal
Reserve  will maintain  monetary stimulus  as it awaits a pick-up
in economic growth, stoking demand for government debt.  Treasuries (BUSY110)  remained higher as the U.S. sold $33 billion of
two-year notes at a yield of 0.348 percent, below a forecast of
0.354 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of seven of the Federal
Reserve’s 21 primary dealers. The Fed last week maintained its
policy of buying $85 billion of debt a month to put downward
pressure on borrowing costs, causing investors to push back
forecasts for when the central bank will raise  interest rates .  There’s a “gradual acceptance by the market that the Fed
will remain accommodative,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate
strategist in  New York  at BNP Paribas SA, a primary dealer.
“The market is going to be grinding to lower yields over the
next few months.”  The benchmark 10-year note yield fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.66 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
based on Bloomberg Bond Trader data, after declining five basis
points in the previous two trading days. The yield touched 2.64
percent, the lowest since Aug. 13. The price of the 2.5 percent
security due in August 2023 added 3/8, or $3.75 per $1,000 face
value, to 98 21/32.  The current  two-year yield  was little changed at 0.33
percent.  Auction Participation  Treasury trading  volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , rose 35 percent to $306.3
billion, from $226 billion yesterday. Volume surged to $459.9
billion on Sept. 18, when the Fed unexpectedly maintained the
pace of its bond-buying program known as quantitative easing.  At today’s two-year note auction,  indirect bidders , an
investor class that includes foreign central banks, purchased 24
percent of the notes, compared with an average of 24.1 percent
for the past 10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 21.8 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 22.6 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  “It was a solid auction all the way through -- shorts are
getting squeezed with the Fed now not in play with tapering,”
said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income
trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. “There’s a
certain amount of give-back. This is a reflection of people
having money to invest.” A short position is a bet an asset
will decline in value.  New Cash  Two-year notes have gained 0.2 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 2.9 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall rose 2.2 percent.  The sales this week, along with last week’s $13 billion 10-year TIPS auction, will raise $47.6 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $62.3 billion,
according to the Treasury.  Investors bid $2.88 for each dollar of the $1.554 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  The Treasury also plans to sell $35 billion of five-year
notes tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year debt the next day.  ‘Grinding Higher’  Investors in Treasuries were long this week, betting that
the prices of the securities will rise, according to a survey by
JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The  proportion  of net longs remained steady at 8 percentage
points in the week ending yesterday, according to JPMorgan,
matching the position in the week ending Sept. 16. Outright
longs dropped to 19 percent, from 21 percent, while outright
shorts dropped to 11 percent from 13 percent. Investors raised
neutral bets to 70 percent from 66 percent.  “Momentum remains relatively constructive in the Treasury
market in the wake of the Fed’s decision not to taper,” said
 Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market is grinding a little
bit higher.”  Treasuries due in one to 10 years have returned 0.1 percent
this quarter as of yesterday, based on the Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. U.S. government  securities  maturing in a decade and
longer dropped 2.9 percent.  Washington Debate  The market for U.S. government debt has yet to react to any
potential impasse over raising the borrowing ceiling. Most
federal operations would come to a halt when the fiscal year
ends Sept. 30 if President  Barack Obama ’s administration and
lawmakers can’t agree on a funding plan.  Treasuries that mature on Oct. 15 yielded 0.035 percent,
from 0.037 percent two weeks ago. The rate on debt due Nov. 7
has held within two basis points of zero during the period.  Treasuries remained higher today as a report showed  home
prices  in 20 U.S. cities rose in the 12 months through July by
the most in more than seven years, helping boost owner equity.  The S&P/Case-Shiller  index of property values  in 20 cities
increased 12.4 percent from July 2012, matching the median
projection of 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg and the
biggest year-to-year advance since February 2006, a report from
the group showed today in New York.  The Conference Board’s index of U.S.  consumer confidence 
decreased to 79.7 in September from a revised 81.8 a month
earlier, data from the New York-based private research group
showed today. The Richmond Fed’s  manufacturing index  tumbled to
zero from 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
