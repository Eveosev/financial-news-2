Asian  stocks  fell from a four-month
high amid a political showdown in Washington over the U.S.
budget and as investors examined speeches from Federal Reserve
officials for clues on monetary policy.  Nikon Corp. (7203) , a camera maker that gets 85 percent of sales
overseas, sank 2.3 percent as a stronger yen cut the earnings
prospects for Japanese exporters.  Lixil Corp. (5938) , a toilet maker
said to be in advanced talks to buy German bathroom-fixtures
company Grohe Group for more than 3 billion euros ($4 billion),
lost 6.3 percent in Tokyo. Jiangxi Copper Co., China’s biggest
producer of the metal, slipped 1.7 percent in  Hong Kong  as
copper futures fell.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.6 percent to 140.37 as
of 6:15 p.m. in Hong Kong, with all 10 industry groups on the
gauge declining. The measure has climbed 7.8 percent in
September, on course for the best month since January 2012,
after the Fed maintained the pace of its stimulus and data
showed China’s economic growth is stabilizing. The yen traded at
98.76 per dollar, strengthening from the Sept. 20 close of
equity markets in Tokyo last week.  “The increasingly ugly debate on the U.S. fiscal position
is certainly a primary concern for markets,”  Angus Gluskie ,
chief investment officer who helps oversee about $500 million at
White Funds Management in Sydney, said by telephone. “Markets
are comforted by the realization that the Fed is not going to
rush at it. They are much more likely to go slowly at the
tapering.”  Government Shutdown  House Speaker  John Boehner  and his Republican caucus are
pushing the federal government closer to a shutdown in a fight
over funding and the debt limit, Democrats  Max Baucus  and  Patty
Murray  said in a letter to colleagues yesterday. Investors are
considering these political disagreements one week after the Fed
unexpectedly maintained $85 billion a month in bond purchases.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index retreated 0.8 percent. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland shares traded in the
city fell 1.1 percent. The measure entered a bull market this
month after rebounding more than 20 percent from a June low,
while the Hang Seng Index erased its 2013 loss. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index today slid 0.6 percent  Japan’s  Topix (TPX)  index lost 0.3 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index declined 0.4 percent, and South Korea’s Kospi index
fell 0.1 percent. Singapore’s Straits Times Index slipped 0.1
percent while New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent.
Taiwan’s Taiex Index added 0.1 percent. Futures on the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index were little changed.  Fed Chiefs  Regional Fed bank presidents spoke yesterday. Fed Bank of
 New York  President William C. Dudley said policy makers must
“forcefully” push against economic headwinds as the U.S. has
yet to show “any meaningful pickup” in momentum. Fed Bank of
Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said monetary policy should
focus on creating a more dynamic economy. Meanwhile, Fed Bank of
Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said the central bank harmed its
credibility with the last week’s decision not to reduce bond
buying.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index trades at 13.7 times  estimated
earnings , compared with 15.4 for the S&P 500 and 14.3 for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Topix climbed 41 percent this year, the most among
24 developed markets tracked by Bloomberg, amid optimism Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  can lead the country
out of deflation through unprecedented monetary easing.  Exporters Slip  Japanese exporters sank as the yen strengthened against the
dollar. Nikon lost 2.3 percent to 1,768 yen. Canon Inc., the
world’s largest camera maker, declined 2 percent to 3,155 yen.
 Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which gets 83 percent of sales overseas,
slipped 1 percent to 3,840 yen.  Lixil sank 6.3 percent to 2,043 yen. Lixil and Grohe may
announce an agreement as early as this week, said people with
knowledge of the matter, asking not to be identified because the
negotiations are private. An initial public offering remains an
option because no final deal has been reached, they said.  Raw-material producers and energy companies declined as
copper and oil futures fell. Jiangxi Copper dropped 1.7 percent
to HK$16. Inpex Corp., Japan’s top energy explorer, fell 1.4
percent to 459,000 yen.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s second-largest miner, lost 0.8 percent to A$62.10 in Sydney.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  suppliers and part makers climbed after the U.S.
company sold a record nine million iPhones during the weekend
debut of two new models.  Murata Manufacturing Co., an electronic-components
manufacturer that counts Apple as its biggest customer, gained
1.5 percent to 7,410 yen in Tokyo. Largan Precision Co., which
makes lenses for the cameras in Apple’s phones, advanced 1.5
percent to NT$1,010 in Taipei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
