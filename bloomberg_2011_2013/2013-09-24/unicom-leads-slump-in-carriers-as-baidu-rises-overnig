China Unicom (CHU)  (Hong Kong) Ltd. and
China Telecom Corp. led declines in U.S.-traded Chinese equities
after monthly data showed the wireless carriers lost market
share in third-generation services.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. dropped 1 percent to 101.82, the
lowest level in a week. China Unicom, the nation’s second-largest mobile carrier, slid the most in three months and China
Telecom dropped to the lowest price in September. Yanzhou Coal
Mining Co. traded below its Hong Kong shares for a fourth day,
while  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  climbed to the highest level in 17 months.  China Unicom added 3.9 million third-generation mobile
users in August and China Telecom increased 3 million, compared
with 11 million for their bigger rival  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the
companies said this week. China will accept bids from foreign
carriers for licenses to provide Internet services in the
Shanghai free-trade zone as it plans to lift a ban on foreign
websites such as Facebook Inc., the  South China Morning Post 
reported yesterday, citing unidentified government officials.  “China Unicom’s 3G subscriber growth figure was below
market consensus of above 4 million, which caused weakness in
its stock,” Jun Zhang, an analyst at Wedge Partners Corp. in
 Greenwood Village ,  Colorado , said by phone yesterday. “People
became concerned about China Unicom and China Telecom after
seeing that China Mobile gained market share in 3G services.”  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., retreated 1.4 percent to
$38.11 in  New York , the most in four weeks. The Standard &
Poor’s 500  Index (HSCEI)  slipped 0.3 percent.  3G Subscribers  China Unicom’s American depositary receipts slumped 3
percent to $15.75, the steepest retreat since June 20. The Hong
Kong-based company’s total 3G subscribers reached 107.8 million
by the end of August, its monthly data showed.  ADRs of Beijing-based China Telecom declined 2.2 percent to
$50.97, the lowest close since Aug. 30. The company had a total
93.4 million 3G users last month.  The National Development and Reform Commission will
continue to supervise China Telecom and China Unicom in
correcting their monopolistic behavior in the area of broadband
access, China News Service  reported  yesterday, citing Xu Kunlin,
head of the anti-monopoly bureau at the NDRC, the country’s top
planning agency.  China  Mobile’s ADRs slipped 0.6 percent to $56.70. The
company had a total 158.7 million 3G customers, according to
figures it released this week.  Video App  Baidu, owner of China’s most-used online search engine,
climbed 0.6 percent to $150.13 in New York, the highest close
since April 2012.  Users of Baidu’s video app on mobile devices exceeded 100
million, and daily active users surged to 20 million, according
to a Sept. 23  report  on NetEase’s website, citing the company.  “Quickly gaining a large number of users adds to Baidu’s
bargaining power to form a legitimate relationship with video
sources,” 86Research Ltd. said in a note to clients yesterday.  Yanzhou, China’s fourth-biggest coal producer, slipped 2.1
percent to a one-week low of $10.05. Its ADRs, each representing
10 ordinary shares in the Shandong-based company, traded 1.4
percent below its stock in  Hong Kong .  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index slipped 1.1 percent
to 10,599.15 yesterday in a second day of slump, while the
Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.6 percent to 2,207.53, snapping
two days of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
