Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  will visit the U.S. next week to urge President  Barack Obama  and the  United Nations  to judge  Iran  by its actions and
not the overtures of new President Hassan Rohani.  Obama and Rohani are attending the opening of the UN
General Assembly today amid indications from both leaders that
U.S.-Iran relations may be heading for a thaw, possibly paving
the way for a compromise over  Iran’s nuclear program  and the
easing of international sanctions it has triggered.  Concern that the U.S. and its allies might be tempted to
ease penalties on Iran ahead of any agreement has prompted
Netanyahu and other Israeli officials to issue warnings over
Rohani’s more conciliatory tone toward the West, which stands in
contrast to that adopted by his predecessor,  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .  “Iran thinks that soothing words and token actions will
enable it to continue on its path to the bomb,” Netanyahu said
in an e-mailed statement. “Israel would welcome a genuine
diplomatic solution that truly dismantles Iran’s capacity to
develop nuclear weapons. But we will not be fooled by half-measures.”  ‘Serial Refuser’  Netanyahu instructed the Israeli delegation to the General
Assembly to leave the hall during Rohani’s speech today, as they
did last year during Ahmadinejad’s address, the prime minister’s
office said. Finance Minister Yair Lapid, whose Yesh Atid party
is the second biggest faction in Netanyahu’s Likud-led
coalition, criticized the decision as a mistake.  “Israel does not need to be perceived as a serial refuser
of negotiations, as being not interested in solutions on the
road to peace,” Lapid said in a text message. “We should let
the Iranians be the deniers of peace, and not look like the ones
who aren’t open to change.”  At meetings in Washington and  New York , including one with
Obama on Sept. 30, Netanyahu will stress that since Rohani’s
election Iran has continued to upgrade  uranium enrichment  and
plutonium production facilities, according to an official in the
Prime Minister’s Office, speaking anonymously because he’s not
authorized to discuss the matter publicly.  Rohani’s “charm offensive” is no more than a cover for
these activities, the official said, adding that Israel has no
position on the U.S. engaging in direct diplomacy with Iran’s
leadership.  Kerry Talks  U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry  will meet in New York
with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on Sept. 26, in the
highest-level formal talks between the two nations since Iran’s
1979  Islamic Revolution .  Israel says that Iran aims to develop nuclear weapons that
pose an existential threat, and only tough economic sanctions
backed by a credible pledge to use force can halt its plans.
Iran says its nuclear program is intended only for peaceful
civilian purposes.  Netanyahu has laid out four specific conditions Iran must
agree to before the U.S. and Europe lift sanctions: halting all
uranium enrichment, removing all enriched material, closing the
reactor at Fordo near the city of Qom, and stopping plutonium
production.  “While Israel may express itself differently from
countries that aren’t directly threatened by Iran, that’s a
matter mainly of tone,”  Zalman Shoval , a former Israeli
ambassador to the U.S. who advises Netanyahu on international
affairs, said in a phone interview. “Right now there’s very
little space between Israel and the U.S. on basic Iran policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
