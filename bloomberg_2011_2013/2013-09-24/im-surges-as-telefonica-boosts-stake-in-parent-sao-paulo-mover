Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) , Brazil’s
second-biggest mobile carrier by market share, rose to a 14-month high as speculation mounted that its parent company will
sell the unit as part of a plan to reduce debt.  The company’s shares  gained  5.8 percent to 10.70 reais at
12:02 p.m. in Sao Paulo after  Telefonica SA (TEF)  said in a statement
that it agreed to pay $596 million to increase its stake in
 Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) , which controls Tim, to 66 percent from 46
percent.  Telefonica’s expanded influence over the Italian phone
company, which is looking for capital to pare more than $38
billion in net debt, fueled speculation that a sale of Tim could
be part of the plan.  Tim’s press office in Rio de Janeiro declined to comment.
Telecom Italia’s and Telefonica’s press offices didn’t
immediately respond to e-mail messages from Bloomberg News
seeking comment.  Tim is  Brazil ’s fastest-growing mobile phone operator with
a 27 percent share as of July, behind Telefonica Brasil’s Vivo
brand with 29 percent, according to data compiled by consulting
group Teleco. The stock’s gain today was the best performance on
the Ibovespa benchmark and pushed this year’s advance to 30
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
