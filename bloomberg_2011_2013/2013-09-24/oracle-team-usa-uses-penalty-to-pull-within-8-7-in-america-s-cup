Oracle Team USA won its sixth
straight race to pull within 8-7 in the America’s Cup, taking
advantage of a penalty at the start to defeat Emirates Team New
Zealand today in the first of two races on  San Francisco Bay .  The first boat to capture nine races is the winner of the
162-year-old sailing regatta.  New Zealand, which led 8-1 last week, still needs one more
win to clinch victory. The defending champion USA team,
bankrolled by Oracle Corp. chief executive  Larry Ellison , has to
win the next two races to retain the Auld Mug.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
