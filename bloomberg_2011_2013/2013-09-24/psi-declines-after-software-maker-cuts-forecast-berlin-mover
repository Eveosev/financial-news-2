PSI AG, a maker of software that
helps control blast furnaces, gas networks and public transport
systems, fell the most in three years after cutting its profit
forecast by more than half.  The shares  tumbled  as much as 14 percent, the steepest
intraday decline since April 2010. The shares traded 13 percent
lower at 11.88 euros as of 10:38 a.m. in  Frankfurt , extending
this year’s decline to 23 percent and valuing the company at 187
million euros ($253 million).  Additional costs from logistics and energy projects mean
PSI now expects full-year earnings before interest and taxes of
5.2 million euros, the Berlin-based company said in a statement
today. It forecast Ebit of 14 million euros to 17 million euros
in March.  The extra costs are “fully unexpected,”  Michael Schaefer ,
a Frankfurt-based analyst at Equinet, wrote in a note to clients
today. “This leaves visibility on earnings recovery totally in
the clouds.”  In 2014 and 2015, Ebit will reach 12 million euros and 15
million euros respectively, less than previously forecast, PSI
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
