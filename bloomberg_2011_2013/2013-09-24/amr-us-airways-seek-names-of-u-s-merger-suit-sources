AMR Corp. (AAMRQ)  and  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC) 
are seeking a court order requiring government officials to
disclose the identities of people interviewed before filing a
lawsuit seeking to halt the airlines’ proposed merger.  The Justice Department has refused to turn over the names
of those who were interviewed during the investigation of the
proposed merger, the airlines said in a filing today in federal
court in Washington.  “Having chosen to file suit, plaintiffs cannot now
withhold the relevant facts they learned from those third
parties,” they said, referring to the government and a group of
state attorneys general.  The U.S. claims the proposed merger of AMR’s American
Airlines and  US Airways  would reduce competition, while the
airlines defend the deal as good for consumers. The case is
scheduled to begin trial Nov. 25.  The effort to obtain the information comes after AMR and US
Airways moved last week to obtain records from the U.S. about
government approvals of past airline mergers, saying they need
the information to fight the government’s case.  The airlines are asking a court-appointed special master,
Richard Levie, to order disclosure of the names of the people
interviewed “and the factual information those witnesses
disclosed.”  Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately respond after regular business hours to an e-mail
seeking comment on the filing.  The case is U.S. v. US Airways Group Inc., 13-cv-01236,
U.S. District Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
