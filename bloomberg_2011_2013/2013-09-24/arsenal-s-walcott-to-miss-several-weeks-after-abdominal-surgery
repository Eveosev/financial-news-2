Arsenal forward Theo Walcott will
be out for several weeks because he needs a minor procedure on
his abdomen, the north London soccer club said.  Walcott will undergo surgery in  Germany  and won’t be
available until the next international break, Arsenal said today
in a statement on its website.  The 24-year-old didn’t play in last weekend’s 3-1 victory
over Stoke because of the injury. He’ll start rehabilitation
immediately after the procedure, and will return after  England ’s
next round of games, which occur in the middle of October.  “Theo will be out for a few weeks,” manager Arsene Wenger
said on the website. “He has developed some damage to his
posterior abdominal wall. It’s not a hernia, but it’s a little
structural problem in his abdomen.  Walcott has scored once in his seven matches this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
