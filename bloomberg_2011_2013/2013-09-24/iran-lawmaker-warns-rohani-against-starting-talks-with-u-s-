A senior Iranian lawmaker warned
President Hassan Rohani against holding talks with the U.S., in
a sign that any campaign for a thaw with the West may encounter
domestic opposition in the Islamic Republic.  “There’ll be no negotiations with the U.S.,” said
Mohammad Kosari, a conservative member of parliament on the
legislature’s Security and Foreign Policy Commission,  in an
interview  with Etemaad newspaper. “After the U.S. has returned
confiscated assets, the sanctions are removed, and they have
apologized for the crimes they have committed against  Iran , then
we can investigate if we will enter talks with them or not.”  Both Rohani and President  Barack Obama  have indicated an
interest in closing a three-decade-old rupture between the two
countries. The two may potentially cross paths at a United
Nations luncheon today. Iran’s economy has been squeezed by
sanctions imposed by the U.S. and allies to curb its nuclear
program.  Rohani said last weekend that Iran “is ready to talk and
negotiate with the West, provided that there are no
preconditions, the talks are on equal terms and there is mutual
respect.” The country’s top policy maker, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, last week said it was time for Iran to exercise
“heroic flexibility” in diplomacy without giving important
ground to its foes.  In the interview with Etemaad, Kosari said such
declarations were a “tactical move” that probably wouldn’t
lead to direct talks with the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
