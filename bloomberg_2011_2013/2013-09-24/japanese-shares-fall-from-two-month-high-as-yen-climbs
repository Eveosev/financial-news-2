Japanese  stocks  fell, with the
 Topix (TPX)  index retreating from a two-month high, as exporters
retreated after the yen rose yesterday and held gains today.  Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets 79 percent of sales
overseas, slid 2 percent. Lixil Group Corp. sank 6.3 percent as
the toilet maker was said to be in talks to buy  Germany ’s Grohe
Group for more than 3 billion euros ($4 billion). Haseko Corp.
lost 2.7 percent after the Yomiuri newspaper reported the Tokyo
tax bureau found that the builder hid income.  The Topix dropped 0.3 percent to 1,214.87 at the close in
Tokyo after finishing last week at its highest since July 24.
The Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.1 percent to 14,732.61.
 Japan ’s currency gained 0.5 percent against the dollar yesterday
when equity markets were closed for a holiday, before weakening
less than 0.1 percent today.  “The yen has strengthened somewhat, weighing on shares,”
said Osamu Koizumi, a Tokyo-based executive officer at Meiji
Yasuda Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of
$17 billion in assets. “Japanese shares have rallied almost
nonstop this month, and it will take something more, such as
further stimulus, to extend gains from here.”  The Topix has climbed 9.8 percent in September after
falling for four months and is up more than 7 percent this
quarter. The gauge surged 41 percent for the year, making
Japanese equities the best performers among developed markets as
the Bank of Japan’s monetary easing weakened the yen, supporting
exporters.  Sales Tax  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will announce on Oct. 1 that he
will raise the nation’s  sales tax , the Asahi newspaper reported
on Sept. 21 without citing anyone. Japan will provide more than
5 trillion yen ($51 billion) of additional stimulus beginning in
the year starting April 2014 to counteract the increased levy,
the newspaper reported.  Exporters fell after the yen gained yesterday. Canon
dropped 2 percent to 3,155 yen. Sony Corp., an electronics maker
that gets 68 percent of its sales abroad, lost 1.6 percent to
2,097 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The measure lost 0.5 percent yesterday, falling
for a third day from a record high, as financial shares slumped
and investors watched speeches from Federal Reserve officials
for clues on monetary policy.  Data yesterday showed a Chinese manufacturing index rose to
a six-month high in September, signaling that a rebound in the
world’s second-largest economy is gaining steam. The preliminary
reading of 51.2 for a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index released by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics compared with a 50.9
median estimate from economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  ‘Providing Floor’  “Japanese stocks are following the drop in U.S. shares,”
said  Soichiro Monji , chief strategist at Tokyo-based Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which manages the equivalent of about 5
trillion yen. “But losses are limited because the China PMI
beat estimates during yesterday’s holiday. That’s providing a
floor to the market.”  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  was re-elected on Sept. 22,
winning the highest share of votes since  Helmut Kohl ’s post-reunification victory in 1990.  Lixil Group slid 6.3 percent to 2,043 yen. Its subsidiary
and Grohe may announce an agreement as early as this week,
according to people with knowledge of the matter. Lixil said
last month it’s considering overseas alliances and acquisitions
to more than double sales to 1 trillion yen.  Haseko lost 2.7 percent to 143 yen after the Yomiuri
newspaper reported the  Tokyo  tax bureau found that the builder
hid a total 2.5 billion yen of income over three years through
March 2012. Haseko has agreed to comply with the decision made
by the bureau, spokesman Hidetake Ishinaga said by phone today.  iPhone Sales  Among stocks that rose, Murata Manufacturing Co., an
electronic-components manufacturer that counts Apple Inc. as its
biggest customer, gained 1.5 percent to 7,410 yen after the U.S.
company sold a record 9 million iPhones in the weekend debut of
two new models.  The handset were also available for the first time from NTT
DoCoMo Inc., Japan’s largest wireless network. The stock added
0.9 percent to 163,200 yen. KDDI Corp., which also sells the
iPhone, jumped 2.9 percent to 4,950 yen. SoftBank Corp., another
distributor, added 1.1 percent to 6,630 yen.  The Topix  traded  at 1.27 times book value today, compared
with 2.50 for the S&P 500 and 1.76 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The Japanese measure’s 30-day historic
 volatility  was at 19.73 today, compared with its five-year
median of 19.42.  To contact the reporter on this story:
