Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  won dismissal
of class-action claims in a regional gender discrimination
lawsuit filed by women who were formerly part of a nationwide
lawsuit against the world’s largest retailer.  U.S. District Judge Robert N. Scola in Miami yesterday said
governing law in the appellate circuit in which his court is
located prohibits the filing of a second class action if the
time to do so expired while the prior case was pending.  The lawsuit was filed last year on behalf of women who had
worked for the retailer in Florida,  North Carolina , Virginia and
four other states in the southeastern U.S. after the U.S.
Supreme Court disallowed a national class action suit.  “Plaintiffs’ class claims run afoul of the no-piggybacking
rule,” Scola said in his ruling.  “Plaintiffs’ class claims are time-barred -- the
limitations period for class claims was not tolled -- and
plaintiffs cannot assert class claims that were previously
asserted and rejected” by the  Supreme Court ’s 2011 decision in
Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the judge said.  The Dukes case was filed in federal court in  San Francisco 
in 2001. A U.S. judge there last month ruled the women in that
case couldn’t sue as a group because the evidence didn’t support
their claim of a general policy of discrimination.  The case is Love v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., 12-cv-61959, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Florida ( Fort Lauderdale ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
