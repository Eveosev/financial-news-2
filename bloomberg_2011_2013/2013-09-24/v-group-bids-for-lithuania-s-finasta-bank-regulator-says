Estonia’s LHV Group AS submitted a
bid to buy the Finasta investment banking unit of bankrupt
Bankas Snoras AB as part of Baltic expansion plans.  The Bank of  Lithuania  in the capital Vilnius will decide by
Dec. 18 on the Tallinn-based banking group’s request for
permission to buy  Bankas Finasta AB  as well as the related
brokerage and asset-management companies, the central bank said
in an e-mailed statement today. It remains open to other
bidders.  “This assessment of documents doesn’t prevent other
possible investors from applying,” the central bank said.  Snoras, once Lithuania’s third-biggest lender by deposits,
was declared bankrupt and taken over by the central bank in
November 2011 after assets were discovered missing from its
balance sheet. Bankruptcy administrator Neil Cooper has said
that completing the sale of companies in the Finasta group is
among the top priorities this year.  LHV together with the Lithuanian investment company RAZFin
bought Snoras’s former leasing unit Snoro Lizingas UAB in
August, saying it wanted to expand in the Baltic region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
