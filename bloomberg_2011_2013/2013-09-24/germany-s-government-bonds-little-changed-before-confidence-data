European government bonds advanced
as central bank officials signaled they are open to providing
additional emergency loans to banks to keep borrowing costs low.  German  10-year bunds  rose for a second day as European
Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said policy
makers will debate whether more longer-term refinancing
operations were needed. Policy maker Benoit Coeure said the
discussion was “open,” though there had been no specific talk
about what instrument to use. Italy’s  10-year bonds  gained for a
seventh day, the longest streak since 2010. Bunds were also
boosted as business sentiment rose less than analysts forecast.  “European bonds are underpinned by speculation that policy
makers will reiterate their stand that more could be done to
support the economy,” said Martin Munksgaard, a fixed-income
trader at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen. “The Ifo data, while
still at a solid level, came in lower than the market
expected.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.85 percent at 4:11 p.m. London time after
dropping to 1.85 percent, the lowest level since Aug. 30. The 2
percent bund due in August 2023 rose 0.575, or 5.75 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,349) face amount, to 101.31.  The Italian 10-year yield declined four basis points to
4.22 percent after dropping to 4.20 percent, the least since
Aug. 16. Similar-maturity  Portuguese rates  decreased 11 basis
points to 4.23 percent.  ‘Definitely Important’  Whether a new LTRO is needed “is a discussion that we are
having in the ECB or that we will have,” Nowotny told reporters
in Vienna. “It is definitely important to show the range of our
instruments, and that these are flexible.”  ECB President Mario Draghi said yesterday in testimony to
the European Parliament in Brussels that he was ready to deploy
another LTRO to maintain short-term money markets at a level
warranted by the central bank’s assessment of inflation.  Three-month Euribor, the rate at which banks say they can
borrow euros, is 0.221 percent, having risen from as low as
0.181 percent in December 2012, according to data from the
European Banking Federation.  The ECB flooded financial markets with tranches of three-year loans in December 2011 and February 2012 to avert a credit
crunch after banks stopped lending in Europe’s sovereign-debt
crisis. Euro-region lenders will repay 7.91 billion euros of the
three-year loans this week, the most since May, data released by
the ECB on Sept. 20 showed.  ‘Dovish’ Rhetoric  “We had dovish central-bank rhetoric yesterday,” said
Richard McGuire, senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in  London  “That means the primary focus today
will be on the slew of ECB speeches which will be parsed for any
further indications that more stimulus is on the way.”  German bunds also advanced as the Ifo institute said its
business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
climbed to 107.7 from a revised 107.6 in August. That compared
with a median forecast of 108 in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Netherlands auctioned 2.35 billion euros of three-year
notes at an average yield of 0.435 percent, compared with 0.495
percent at the previous sale on June 11. Spain allotted 3.58
billion euros of bills.  Austrian  five-year notes  gained for a second day as the
nation sold 4 billion euros of new benchmark securities due in
October 2018 through banks.  The five-year yield dropped four basis points to 0.94
percent after falling to 0.91 percent on Sept. 19, the lowest
level since Aug. 13.  German Supply  Germany will issue 54 billion euros in bonds and bills in
the fourth quarter, the Federal Finance Agency said today in an
e-mailed statement. That’s 3 billion euros less than its
previous estimate.  Volatility on Germany bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Austria and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  German bonds lost 2.2 percent this year through yesterday,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Dutch securities
dropped 2.8 percent, while Italy’s returned 4.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
