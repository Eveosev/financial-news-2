Brazil ’s real declined as Banco
Santander SA forecast that the current-account deficit widened
further in August after reaching a decade high.  The real depreciated 0.4 percent to 2.2080 at 9:58 a.m. in
Sao Paulo. Swap rates due January 2015 fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 10.08 percent.  Brazil’s current-account deficit expanded to 3.5 percent of
annual gross domestic product in the 12 months through August,
Banco Santander analysts Fernanda Consorte, Tatiana Pinheiro and
Adriana Dupita said in a research note today before the central
bank’s report. The deficit was 3.39 percent in the prior month,
the widest since 2002.  “The current account could remain very weak for several
months, in our view, with the full effect of the real’s
depreciation not being felt by some more sensitive items, such
as remittances of profits and dividends and international
travel,” the Santander analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
