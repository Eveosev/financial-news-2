U.S. stock-index futures advanced,
signaling the equity market will rebound after a three-day
slump, after a report showed  home prices  in 20 U.S. cities rose
by the most in more than seven years.  Futures on the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index increased 0.1
percent to 1,694.70 at 9:05 a.m. in  New York  after fluctuating
between gains and losses before the home-price report. The
benchmark gauge had lost 1.4 percent in the previous three
sessions.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities
increased 12.4 percent in July compared with July 2012, matching
the median projection of 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg and
the biggest year-to-year advance since February 2006, a report
from the group showed today in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
