Detroit Lions  leading receiver Nate Burleson broke his arm after crashing into a highway median,
with police saying he became distracted and lost control of his
car when pizzas fell off the front seat.  Burleson, who was returning home after watching last
night’s “Monday Night Football” game with teammates, will have
surgery tomorrow, Lions coach Jim Schwartz said.  Alcohol wasn’t a factor in the accident, according to a
news release from the Michigan State Police. Burleson lost
control of his sport-utility vehicle on Interstate 696 in
Farmington Hills, about 30 miles northwest of  Detroit , at about
2:25 a.m. local time when he tried to catch the falling pizzas,
police spokesman Michael Shaw said in an e-mail.  “Understandably his spirits are low,” Schwartz said at a
news conference. “He just came off his best performance as a
Lion. He was just getting in to the swing of things. He was a
big part of our offense.”  Burleson had 19 receptions -- two more than teammate  Calvin Johnson  -- for 239 yards through the Lions’ first three games.
He had six catches for 116 yards in a 27-20 win over the
 Washington Redskins  two days ago.  An 11-year NFL veteran, Burleson is in his fourth season
with the Lions. He had 43 catches for 240 yards and two
touchdowns last year. Schwartz said the team has no plans, for
now, to put Burleson on season-ending injured reserve.  “The next guy has to step up,” Schwartz said. “We are
prepared to do that as a team. Nate will be back at some point.
When he is, he will be a big contributor again.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
