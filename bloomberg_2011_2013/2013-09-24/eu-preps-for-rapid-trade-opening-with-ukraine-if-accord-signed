European Union governments prepared
to speed trade concessions to Ukraine if the two sides overcome
political barriers to a broader partnership accord.  Representatives of the 28 EU national governments agreed
yesterday to enact the free-trade elements of a proposed
 Association Agreement  once it’s signed, without waiting for
national ratification of the full pact, an EU official told
reporters in Brussels today.  Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius of  Lithuania , which
holds the EU’s rotating presidency, said the agreement would
mean “90 percent of the free-trade agreement could be applied
without the ratification process,” the  Baltic News Service 
reported.  Russia’s determination to keep Ukraine within its sphere of
influence is the main political obstacle to closer EU-Ukraine
ties. The EU also protests Ukraine’s treatment of former Prime
Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko , who was jailed in 2011 in a case
Western officials say was politically motivated.  Lithuania is hoping to orchestrate the signing of an EU-Ukraine accord at a summit in Vilnius in November.  To contact the reporters on this story:
