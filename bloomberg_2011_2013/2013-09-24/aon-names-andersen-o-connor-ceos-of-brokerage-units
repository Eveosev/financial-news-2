Aon Plc (AON) , the world’s second-biggest
insurance broker by market value, named Eric Andersen head of
the Aon Benfield reinsurance operation and Mike O’Connor to lead
the Aon Risk Solutions unit.  Both will report to Steve McGill, group president of Aon
and chief executive officer of the company’s Risk Solutions
segment, the London-based company said in a statement today.
Andersen, 48, was most recently CEO of Aon Risk Solutions
Americas, while O’Connor, 45, was chief operating officer of the 
risk business.  CEO Greg Case is shuffling managers as he vies with Marsh &
McLennan Cos. and Willis Group Holdings Plc to broker coverage
and consult with businesses on risk management. Aon also said
Bryon Ehrhart will be CEO of Aon Benfield in the Americas.  The leadership changes are “a natural evolution,” McGill
said in the statement. “We must continue to stay ahead of the
curve for our clients.”  Andersen is taking a role that was previously split between
Dominic Christian and Mike Bungert, said David Prosperi, a
spokesman for the company. Some the O’Connor’s new duties were
previously handled by McGill.  Bungert will become chairman of the reinsurance unit with a
focus on the Americas, and Christian will be executive chairman
of Aon Benfield International.  Aon has rallied 36 percent this year,  compared  with the 20
percent advance in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. New York-based Marsh & McLennan is the largest insurance broker by market
value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
