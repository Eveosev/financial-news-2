Rubber fell the most in nearly two
months as weakening crude oil prices and gains in the yen until
the final hour of trading on the commodities bourse cut its
appeal.  The contract for February delivery fell 2.6 percent to
276.4 yen a kilogram ($2,789 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange. That’s the biggest drop in the closing price
of a most-active contract since July 29, and pares gains this
month to 2.7 percent.  West Texas Intermediate traded near the lowest in more than
six weeks on speculation a United Nations resolution this week
will reduce the likelihood of U.S.-led strikes against  Syria .
Natural rubber competes with oil-derived alternatives for use in
tires. The yen climbed after Federal Reserve Bank of  New York 
President William C. Dudley said policy makers must
“forcefully” push against economic headwinds.  “Rubber lacked support from Shanghai and crude oil markets,
reducing investor demand,” Megumi Saito, trader at commodity
broker Yutaka Shoji Co., said by phone from Tokyo.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 1.3 percent to close at 20,635  yuan  ($3,372) a ton.
 Thai rubber  free-on-board remained unchanged at 82.50 baht
($2.64) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of Thailand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
