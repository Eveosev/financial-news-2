Ethanol tumbled versus gasoline on
speculation that producers of the biofuel are seeing lower corn
costs as the harvest begins.  The spread, or price difference, widened 9.42 cents to
83.12 cents a gallon as ethanol dropped with corn, the primary
feedstock for the fuel in the U.S. The harvest is usually from
September to November.  “We see producers out here really pushing it down, they’re
selling,” said Jim Damask, a manager at StarFuels Inc., in
Jupiter,  Florida . “Corn must be showing up. They must be
getting their hands on some cheap corn.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery sank 5.8 cents, or
3.1 percent, to $1.828 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have declined 17 percent this year.  Gasoline for October delivery gained 3.62 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.6592 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.
Farmers responded to last summer’s drought that devastated
yields by planting record acres of the grain.  Corn for December delivery slumped 4.5 cents, or 1 percent,
to $4.4875 a bushel in  Chicago . The December crush spread of
corn to ethanol was minus 3 cents, down from break-even
yesterday. All crush spreads through July 2016 were negative.  In cash market trading, ethanol dropped 60 cents to $2.375
a gallon in Chicago, 25 cents to $2.20 in New York, 5 cents to
$2.275 on the West Coast and 0.5 cent to $2.325 on the West
Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Chicago’s premium to New York Harbor contracted 35 cents to
17.5 cents, while the West Coast’s discount to the Gulf widened
4.5 cents to 5 cents.  EIA is scheduled to release the latest ethanol production,
supply and import figures tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
