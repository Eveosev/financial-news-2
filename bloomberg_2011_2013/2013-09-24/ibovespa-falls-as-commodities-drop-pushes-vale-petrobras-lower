The Ibovespa fell for the third
time in four sessions as raw-material producers including mining
company Vale SA followed a drop in commodities, outweighing a
rally by wireless carrier  Tim Participacoes SA. (TIMP3)   Restoque Comercio e Confeccoes de Roupas SA , the apparel
maker that owns the clothing retailer Le Lis Blanc, sank after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its recommendation to the equivalent of
sell. Paper maker Klabin SA fell the most on the MSCI
Brazil/Materials Index.  The Ibovespa retreated 0.8 percent to 54,181.90 at 11:02
a.m. in  Sao Paulo , with 54  stocks  lower and 16 higher. The gauge
is up 14 percent since the end of June, poised for its biggest
quarterly advance in four years. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI
index of 24 raw materials slipped 0.7 percent, with crude and
metals falling, amid concern that a political clash over the
U.S. budget might shut down the federal government.  “The U.S. budget talks are something to be watched,”
Fernando Goes, an analyst at Sao Paulo-based brokerage Clear
Corretora, said in a phone interview. “That could spark some
profit taking in the short term, considering that Brazilian
equities have gained quite a bit recently.”  The U.S. government’s next fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and
some services may be suspended unless Congress agrees on a
spending bill by then. The debt ceiling could be reached some
time after the middle of next month, according to the Treasury
Department.  Vale fell 0.9 percent to 32.46 reais. Klabin lost 2.3
percent to 11.74 reais. Tim jumped 6.3 percent to 10.75 reais
after Madrid-based  Telefonica SA (TEF)  agreed to boost its stake in
parent  Telecom Italia SpA. (TIT)   The real weakened 0.4 percent to 2.2080 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
