Palm rose the most in more than a
week on speculation increasing exports from  Malaysia  may slow an
expansion in reserves and as the nation’s currency weakened for
a third day, boosting the appeal of ringgit-denominated futures.  The contract for delivery in December climbed as much as
0.9 percent, the most since Sept. 12, to 2,329 ringgit ($727) a
metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives, and was at 2,323
ringgit at the midday break in Kuala Lumpur. Futures have lost
3.4 percent this month after posting the biggest gain in almost
three years in August. Palm for physical delivery in October was
at 2,320 ringgit yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Shipments from the world’s second-largest producer rose 13
percent to 996,377 tons in the first 20 days of September from
the same period a month earlier, according to surveyor Intertek.
The Malaysian currency fell the most in three months yesterday
on speculation that gains last week were excessive.  “The weaker ringgit, and the strong export data have
helped lift prices,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB Investment
Bank Bhd. “Higher exports will absorb the higher supply that’s
still to come on stream this month, so the increase in
stockpiles may not be as large as some people are projecting.”  Exports in August climbed 7.4 percent, the biggest gain
since March, according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Reserves
were little changed at 1.67 million tons, about 21 percent lower
than a year ago. Stockpiles in  Indonesia  probably fell 6.4
percent to 2.2 million tons in August, the lowest level since
June 2012, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Soybeans for delivery in November rose 0.6 percent to
$13.1525 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
December delivery climbed 0.3 percent to 42.37 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for January delivery increased 1 percent
to 5,416  yuan  ($885) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil gained 0.6 percent to 7,080 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
