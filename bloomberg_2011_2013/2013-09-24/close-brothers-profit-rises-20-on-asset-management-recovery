Close Brothers Group Plc (CBG) , the
British financial services company founded in 1878, said full-year profit rose 20 percent after it restructured its asset
management arm and increased lending.  Net income for the 12 months to July 31 increased to 119.4
million pounds ($191.5 million) from 99.7 million pounds in the
year-earlier period, the London-based lender said in a statement
today. The asset-management unit posted a profit of 4 million
pounds from a 4.3 million-pound loss.  Close Brothers has been restructuring its funds business to
focus on  wealth management  for U.K. private clients, and in 2011
sold its advisory, U.K. offshore and Cayman Islands operations
to concentrate on banking, securities and asset management.  “The financial year was again shaped by a subdued economic
environment, with slow growth and events in the  euro zone 
continuing to impact sentiment,” Chief Executive Officer Preben Prebensen said in the statement. “There are significant
opportunities in the U.K.’s markets. The group’s U.K. focus
places us in a strong position to make the most of these.”  The shares were up 1.9 percent to 1155 pence at 8:17 a.m.
in London trading, giving the company a market value of 1.7
billion pounds.  Revenue rose 10 percent to 582.9 million pounds, the
company said. The lender’s loan book grew 13 percent to 4.6
billion pounds over the period.  Profit in the banking business, which makes short-term,
secured commercial loans, gained 17 percent to 157.8 million
pounds. The securities division, comprising stockbroker
Winterfood Securities, reported profit of 25.7 million pounds,
up 5 percent.  The full-year dividend rose 7 percent to 44.5 pence a
share.  -- Editor: Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
