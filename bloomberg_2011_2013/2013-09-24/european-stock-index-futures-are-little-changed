European  stocks  advanced, following
a two-day decline, as telecommunications companies climbed,
outweighing U.S.  consumer confidence  and regional manufacturing
reports that trailed economists’ estimates.  Telecom Italia (TIT)  SpA gained 1.7 percent as Telefonica SA
agreed to increase its stake in the phone operator. Nokia Oyj
added 2.4 percent after a U.S. judge found that HTC Corp.
violated two of its patents.  Total (FP)  SA climbed 2.6 percent after
Barclays Plc raised its rating on the oil producer. Burckhardt
Compression Holding AG slid 7.3 percent after saying fiscal
first-half net income will decline from the year-earlier period.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index added 0.2 percent to 313.2 at
the close in London. The equity benchmark has climbed 5.3
percent in September,  extending  its rally this year to 12
percent, as the Fed refrained from reducing its monthly bond
buying. The gauge has risen 9.9 percent in the current quarter,
on course for its biggest gain in four years. It is trading at
14.3 times projected earnings, compared with a high of 15.7
times in October 2009.  “In the medium to long term, European equities still look
attractive,” Herbert Perus, who helps oversee about $36 billion
as head of equities at Raiffeisen Capital Management in Vienna,
said by phone. “Valuations are still cheap and more investors
will buy European stocks. In the very short term, the rally we
saw over the last few weeks may come off a bit. If we get a
clear statement from the Fed, that would help markets.”  Consumer Confidence  In the U.S., the Conference Board’s  consumer-confidence
index  slipped to 79.7 this month from a revised 81.8 in August.
The median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
called for a reading of 79.9.  A measure of manufacturing in the region covered by the Fed
Bank of Richmond shrank in September. The  factory index , which
covers  North Carolina ,  South Carolina , the  District of Columbia ,
 Maryland ,  Virginia  and most of  West Virginia , dropped to 0 from
14 last month. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had predicted
the gauge would decline to 12.  In  Germany , the Ifo institute’s  business-climate index ,
based on a survey of 7,000 executives, advanced to 107.7 from a
revised 107.6 in August. That missed the  median economist 
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 108.  National benchmark indexes advanced in 14 out of 18
western-European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 increased 0.2
percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.3 percent, while  France ’s CAC
40 climbed 0.6 percent.  Telecom Italia  Telecom Italia climbed 1.7 percent to 60 euro cents.
Telefonica agreed to pay 324 million euros ($437 million) to
increase its stake in Telco SpA, a holding company that owns
22.4 percent of Telecom Italia, to 66 percent from 46 percent.  Nokia, the Finnish phonemaker that has agreed to sell its
handsets business to  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , climbed 2.4 percent to
4.91 euros. HTC infringed on two  patent rights  held by Nokia,
U.S. International Trade Commission Judge Thomas Pender said in
a notice yesterday. A six-member commission will review the
judge’s findings before deciding whether to block any imports.  Total added 2.6 percent to 43.20 euros after Barclays
raised its recommendation on the stock to equal weight, which is
similar to hold, from underweight. The brokerage said Europe’s
third-biggest oil company can better control its capital
expenditure than it had predicted. Total gave detailed capital-spending plans for exploration and production at its investor
day, according to Barclays.  Close Brothers Group Plc gained 4.9 percent to 1,189 pence
as the British financial services company said full-year net
income rose 20 percent to 119.4 million pounds ($191 million).
Its asset-management unit swung to a profit of 4 million pounds
from a 4.3 million-pound loss a year earlier.  Burckhardt Slides  Burckhardt tumbled 7.3 percent to 358.25 Swiss francs, its
biggest decline in two years, after saying that lower-than-expected gross margins on two major compressor-system projects
will lead the company to make provisions in the six months
through September.  Deutsche Wohnen AG slipped 2.2 percent to 13.25 euros as a
statement showed Blackstone Group LP is selling 8.15 million
shares, or a 4.8 percent  stake , in the German residential
landlord. The price guidance has narrowed to 13.05 euros to
13.10 euros a share, people familiar with the matter said.  Suedzucker AG dropped 3.3 percent to 21.10 euros. The maker
of sugar and starch said it might miss its May forecast of 825
million euros for full-year operating profit following its
CropEnergies unit’s purchase of bioethanol producer Ensus Ltd.
in July.  “It is more challenging to achieve this target due to the
current cautious business development and effects from the
integration of Ensus at CropEnergies,” it said in a statement.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 6 percent greater than the average of the past
30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
