Alberta is raising its estimate for
the cost of record floods that struck the province in June by
C$1 billion ($970 million) to C$6 billion, according to Doug Horner, the province’s finance minister.  The C$6 billion will be spread over three to ten years and
includes costs covered by private insurance companies and
promised aid from the federal government, Horner said in an
interview in Toronto. Alberta had previously estimated the
flood’s cost at C$5 billion.  The flooding was the costliest natural disaster in Canadian
history, the Insurance Bureau of Canada  said  yesterday, when it
estimated insured property damage at more than C$1.7 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
