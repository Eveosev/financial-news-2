Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s second-largest truckmaker, intends to lower annual spending by 4
billion kronor ($620 million) by the end of the 2015 as part of
a broader three-year plan to lift profitability.  Volvo aims to reach the savings target by reducing the
number of white-collar workers and boosting production
efficiencies, the Gothenburg, Sweden-based truckmaker said in a
statement today, without providing details. The cost-reduction
program will lead to 5 billion kronor in charges, it said.  Chief Executive Officer Olof Persson set a goal when he
took over two years ago to put the manufacturer at the top of
the heavy-equipment industry in terms of operating margins.
Second-quarter profit fell 58 percent to 3.26 billion kronor as
a downturn in Europe and an economic slowdown in China prompted
companies to hold off on vehicle purchases.  “This announcement means Persson is serious and making
real changes,”  David Arnold , an automobile specialist at
 Barclays Capital  in London, said in an e-mail to clients.  The shares  gained  as much as 1.20 kronor, or 1.2 percent,
to 102.50 kronor and were up 0.9 percent as of 2:18 p.m. in
Stockholm trading.  The stock has climbed 15 percent this year, valuing the
Swedish company at 217 billion kronor.That compares with a 6.5
percent gain in 2013 at Soedertaelje, Sweden-based competitor
 Scania AB (SCVA)  and a 41 percent jump for  Daimler AG (DAI) , the luxury-car
producer that’s also the world’s largest maker of heavy trucks.  The majority of the restructuring charges are expected to
impact operating income in 2014, Volvo said. Most of the
restructuring measures will take place in the truck unit. Volvo
also makes buses, construction equipment and marine engines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
