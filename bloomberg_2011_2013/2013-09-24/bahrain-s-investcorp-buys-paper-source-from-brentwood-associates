Investcorp Bank BSC, the Bahrain-based alternative-investment firm managing $10.5 billion, said
it acquired Chicago-based retailer Paper Source Inc.  Investcorp bought the stationery and greeting-card company
for an undisclosed amount from Los Angeles-based buyout firm
Brentwood Associates Inc., it said today in an e-mailed
statement. Paper Source, which operates 73 stores across 23
states, designs and produces fine and artisanal papers.  Investcorp said in July it planned to double its dividend
after full-year profit climbed 56 percent to $104.9 million. The
firm, which invests in private equity, funds of  hedge funds  and
real estate, completed eight deals in the fiscal year ending in
June. They included a controlling stake in oil and gas services
provider Hydrasun Ltd.  Investcorp has “a track record of growing strong retail
brands,” Sally Pofcher, Paper Source’s chief executive officer,
said in the statement. The deal gives Paper Source capital to
expand in the U.S. and pursue direct marketing, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
