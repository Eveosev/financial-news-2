EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH) ,  Israel ’s
second-largest chipmaker, climbed the most in two years in New
York as concern eased that  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ’s new processor
will compete with its products.  Shares of EZchip, based in Yokneam, Israel, jumped 16
percent to $26.10 at 1:38 p.m. in New York, set for the biggest
gain since August 2011. Trading volume was 10 times the daily
average of the past 90 days. The stock traded at a 15 percent
 premium  over its Tel Aviv shares, the widest in 16 months.  EZchip plunged 21 percent on Sept. 12 when Cisco, its
biggest customer with 40 percent of revenue, said it developed
its own nPower integrated network processor. The  San Jose ,
California-based chipmaker announced today it will use the
processor in new network convergence systems that neither
previously used, nor were poised to use, EZCH’s product,
according to Feltl & Co.  “Given the announced nPower products do not compete with
current EZCH-based products, such as the ASR-9000, we don’t
believe the EZCH growth story has changed,” Jeffrey A Schreiner, a Minneapolis-based analyst at Feltl, wrote in a
research note today. EZchip “remains undervalued relative to
edge routing market strength.”  Schreiner reiterated a strong buy recommendation on EZchip
with a price target of $39, implying a 52 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
