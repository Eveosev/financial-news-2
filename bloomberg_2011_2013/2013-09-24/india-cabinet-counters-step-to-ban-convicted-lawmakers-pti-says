India ’s cabinet moved to negate a
ruling by the country’s top court that barred some lawmakers
convicted of crimes from holding office,  Press Trust of India 
reported, citing sources it didn’t identify.  The move comes after the ruling Congress party failed to
pass legislation through parliament last month to cancel the
impact of the court ruling, according to the report.  The number of lawmakers charged with offenses has more than
doubled in the last fifteen years. About a  quarter  of federal
and state legislators face charges that include murder, rape and
kidnapping, according to the Association for Democratic Reforms,
which has campaigned for better governance since 1999.  The Supreme Court ruling would have barred lawmakers facing
a jail term of more than two years from office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
