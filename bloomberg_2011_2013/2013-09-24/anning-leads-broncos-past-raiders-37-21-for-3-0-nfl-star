Peyton Manning threw three first-half touchdown passes and the Denver Broncos cruised to a 37-21
victory against the Oakland Raiders that extended their regular-season winning streak to 14 games.  Manning, who completed 32 of 37 passes for 374 yards, now
has a record 12 touchdown passes through the first three weeks
of the National Football League season. He broke the previous
mark of 11 set by Tom Brady of the New England Patriots in 2011,
and said there’s still room for improvement in a Broncos offense
that totaled 536 yards of offense and lost three fumbles.  “When we’re executing and not making mistakes, we can go
the distance,” Manning said in a televised interview. “But you
still see some mistakes -- turnovers, penalties on a short
yardage situation where we had to settle for field goals. Those
are things we have to iron out.”  The Broncos are among seven teams to start 3-0 this season,
joining the Kansas City Chiefs, Patriots and Miami Dolphins in
the American Football Conference, and the Seattle Seahawks, New
Orleans Saints and Chicago Bears in the National Football
Conference.  The Broncos jumped out to a 17-0 lead midway through the
second quarter last night in Denver as Manning threw a pair of
touchdown passes: a two-yarder to Eric Decker and from 12 yards
out to Wes Welker. Matt Prater added a 53-yard field goal for
the home team.  After Terrelle Pryor and Denarius Moore hooked up for a 73-yard touchdown pass that pulled the Raiders within 17-7, Manning
tossed a 13-yard scoring pass to Julius Thomas. Prater then
added two more field goals to push Denver’s lead to 30-7.  Darren McFadden threw a touchdown pass and also ran for a
score for the Raiders, while Ronnie Hillman capped the Broncos’
scoring with a one-yard touchdown run.  Denver’s 127 points through three games is tied for the
second most in NFL history, trailing only the 132 scored over
that span by the 1968 Dallas Cowboys. The 1966 Cowboys also
scored 127 points in their first three games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
