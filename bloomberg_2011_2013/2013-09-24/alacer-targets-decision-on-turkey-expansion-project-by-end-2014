Alacer Gold Corp. (ASR) , the producer
selling mines in  Australia , expects to decide on an expansion at
its Copler operation in  Turkey  by the end of 2014.  The company will select a processing method for mining
sulfide ore at Copler by the end of this year, Rodney Antal,
chief executive officer of Englewood, Colorado-based Alacer said
in an interview yesterday in Denver.  Alacer is among gold miners selling assets to focus on
their most profitable units after bullion slipped into a  bear
market  in April. Antal said the company will focus on its
Turkish operations, after yesterday agreeing to sell its
Higginsville and South Kalgoorlie mines in Australia for A$40
million ($37.6 million).  “The big one really was the Australian assets being
sold,” he said. “The next bit is I think the market really
wants us to finish off the sulfide project studies.”  The company will finish a definitive feasibility study on
the sulfide project once it selects a processing method, Antal
said. It then expects to approve construction of the project.  Alacer doesn’t have plans to stop trading its shares on the
Australian Stock Exchange after selling its mines in the
country, he said. That would be “very difficult practically,”
because the company has a significant shareholder base on the
ASX, Antal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
