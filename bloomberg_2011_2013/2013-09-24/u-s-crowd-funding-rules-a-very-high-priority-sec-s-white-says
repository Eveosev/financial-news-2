The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is moving to propose rules that would allow companies
to raise money through equity crowd-funding and more lightly
regulated offerings, Chairman Mary Jo White said.  The regulator considers it a “very high priority to get
those rulemakings done” and hopes to do so this year, White
said at the Bloomberg Markets 50 Summit in  New York  today.  “Those are things we are devoting maximum resources to,
not neglecting everything else we have to do with our limited
resources,” White said of the rules required under last year’s
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.  White also vowed the agency would eventually adopt a June 5
proposal to add new restrictions to money-market mutual funds
and said the agency is making “lots of progress” toward
finishing the Volcker rule, which bans federally insured banks
from short-term trading for their own account.  “It is a hard, complex rulemaking but lots of progress is
being made,” White said in the interview with Bloomberg
Television’s  Peter Cook .  To contact the reporter on this story:
