Cost savings from adding wind and
solar power to the U.S. electricity grid outweigh expenses
related to switching fossil-fueled  power plants  on and off to
compensate for the intermittent nature of renewable energy,
according to the  National Renewable Energy Laboratory .  Incorporating “high levels” of wind and solar power in
the U.S. West would save as much as $7 billion in annual costs
from purchasing fuel, compared with $35 million to $157 million
in expenses from cycling coal and natural gas plants, the
Golden, Colorado-based research arm of the U.S. Energy
Department said in a statement today.  “Avoided fuel costs are far greater than the increased
cycling costs for fossil-fueled plants,” researcher Debra Lew,
who led the study, said in the statement.  The study evaluated scenarios incorporating as much as one-third of the grid’s total electricity from wind and solar
plants. Every four megawatt-hours of renewable power displaced
about one megawatt-hour of coal power and three megawatt-hours
from gas, according to the study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
