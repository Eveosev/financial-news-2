Calling  Syria ’s civil war the
world’s “biggest peace and security challenge,” United Nations
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the international community
must destroy President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical weapons
stockpile and stop the flow of arms to all parties.  Those who used chemical weapons in the conflict must be
brought to justice “either through referral to the
 International Criminal Court  or by other means consistent with
international law,” Ban said in opening remarks to the UN
General Assembly’s general debate.  Ban cited the need for a diplomatic resolution to the 2
1/2-year conflict, saying a “military victory is an illusion.”  Ban urged Assad’s government to grant more access for
humanitarian aid workers and to “end the unconscionable
targeting of medical facilities and personnel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
