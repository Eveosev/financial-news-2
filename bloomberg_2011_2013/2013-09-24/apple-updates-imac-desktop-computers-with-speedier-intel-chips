Apple Inc. (AAPL) , following on last
week’s debut of new iPhone models, updated its lineup of iMac
desktop computers with faster  Intel Corp. (INTC)  chips and more support
for flash-memory storage.  The new iMacs will run fourth-generation, quad-core Intel
processors and feature faster graphics, Cupertino, California-based Apple said in a statement. The computers, which go on sale
today, also will work with a speedier version of the Wi-Fi
connection standard and PCIe flash storage.  Apple’s wave of new products is helping assuage investor
concerns that the company’s growth is slowing. The shares jumped
5 percent to $490.64 yesterday after the company said it sold 9
million iPhones in the new lineup’s debut weekend, a record. The
iMac, once a top-selling product at Apple, has been eclipsed by
the iPhone and iPad, though its all-in-one format remains a
high-profile symbol of the company’s design.  “IMac continues to be the example that proves how
beautiful, fast and fun a desktop computer can be,”  Philip Schiller , Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing,
said in today’s statement.  Depending on the screen size, processor speed and other
features, the new lineup ranges from $1,299 to $1,999, Apple
said. It’s available with 21.5-inch and 27-inch screens.  Apple shares  were little changed today, closing at $489.10
in  New York . Before yesterday’s jump, the stock had declined 12
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
