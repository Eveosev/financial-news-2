Southern Nevada Water Authority
general manager Pat Mulroy plans to retire early next year after
overseeing the agency that provides drinking water to  Las Vegas 
for more than two decades, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.  Mulroy, 60, didn’t give a specific date for her retirement,
the newspaper reported yesterday. She has been head of the
authority since 1992 and has also been general manager since
1989 of the Las Vegas Valley Water District, the state’s largest
water utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
