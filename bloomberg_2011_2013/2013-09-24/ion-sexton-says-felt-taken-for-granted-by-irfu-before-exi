Ireland and Lions rugby outhalf
Jonathan Sexton said he felt taken for granted by the Irish
Rugby Football Union in contract talks, which ultimately broke
down and prompted him to leave the Leinster team.  Sexton left to join Paris-based Racing Metro this year,
after failing to agree new terms with the union.  In an interview with RTE Radio aired today, Sexton said he
wondered “why didn’t they come earlier with their best foot
forward” earlier. He said he hoped the union would now reach
new agreements with other Leinster players “before it gets
messy.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
