Bank of  Canada  Deputy Governor
Larry Schembri said global policy makers must keep up the pace
of financial sector reform to make sure there’s no repeat of the
2008 credit crisis.  Schembri, in a  speech  today in Ottawa about the Financial
Stability Board, said policy makers should resist the temptation
to ease reforms because economies are weak. Financial stability
is a precondition for growth, said Schembri, in his first speech
since becoming a deputy governor this year.  “As the dark days of the global financial crisis slowly
fade in our collective memory, the real challenge is to maintain
the momentum of reform,” Schembri said, according to the text
of the speech posted on the central bank’s  website .  The Basel, Switzerland-based Financial Stability Board, led
by Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney , is coordinating global
regulators’ response to the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression to prevent a repeat of the turmoil that
followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and
bailout of insurer American International Group Inc. Schembri
was an adviser on FSB issues when Carney ran Canada’s central
bank.  “The FSB has fostered the necessary co-operation and has
made solid progress in coordinating the development of
appropriate global policies to address the main weaknesses
exposed by the crisis,” Schembri said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
