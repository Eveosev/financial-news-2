T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW)  has asked
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to
offer actively managed exchange-traded funds that wouldn’t
disclose their holdings daily.  The first of the funds, if approved by regulators, would
aim to beat the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, according to the
request, filed yesterday with the SEC. T. Rowe Price, based in
Baltimore, joins  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  and  Eaton Vance Corp. (EV)  among
money managers seeking the go-ahead to offer so-called non-transparent active ETFs.  “We see non-transparent active ETFs as an alternative
vehicle for potentially delivering our investment management
expertise to investors, without the prospect of daily
disclosures impacting our existing mutual fund shareholders,
consistent with their best interests,” Heather McDonold, a
spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed message.  To contact the reporter on this story:
