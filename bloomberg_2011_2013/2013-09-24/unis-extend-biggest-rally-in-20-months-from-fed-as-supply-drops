The U.S. municipal market is
heading for its biggest monthly rally since January 2012 as
dwindling supply helps extend gains following the  Federal
Reserve ’s decision to continue the pace of its bond buying.  The $3.7 trillion market gained 2.1 percent this month
through Sept. 23, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show.
Yields on benchmark munis maturing in 10 years fell about 0.1
percentage point to 2.71 percent, the lowest since June 21, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. It was the biggest drop in almost
three months.  Localities from  Connecticut  to California are set to sell
$4.1 billion in long-term debt this week, the least for a non-holiday period since Aug. 16, Bloomberg  data  show. Fed Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  unexpectedly refrained from curbing the central
bank’s monthly bond purchases in a meeting last week.  “The Fed saying that the economy was too weak for them to
tighten was very bond-supportive,” said David Frank, managing
director of muni trading at CastleOak Securities LP in  New York .
“Crossover buyers took a lot of supply out of the market, and
now lack of supply is extending the rally.”  Even though individuals have yanked money from muni mutual
funds for 17 consecutive weeks, in the seven days through Sept.
18 they pulled just $1.1 billion, the smallest withdrawal since
Aug. 7, Lipper US Fund Flows data show.  The $3.1 billion iShares National AMT-Free Muni Bond ETF,
known as  MUB (MUB) , rose 29 cents to $104.28, the highest since July
19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
