Ardagh Group SA’s plan to sell
plants as part of its $1.7 billion acquisition of Verallia North
America from  Cie. de Saint-Gobain SA  wasn’t enough to satisfy
U.S. regulators opposed to the deal.  The Federal Trade Commission, which claims the Verallia
purchase would reduce competition in the market for beer and
liquor bottles, needs more information to evaluate the effect of
the plant sale, Ted Hassi, a lawyer for the agency, said at a
hearing today in federal court in  Washington .  “There are a lot of unanswered questions that can’t be
answered here,” he said. The government needs to know the
identity of the buyer, he said. “We need to know what we’re
shooting at.”  Ardagh said in a statement Sept. 20 that it was selling
four glass-container manufacturing plants as a standalone
business to a single buyer and that it was negotiating with “a
number” of possible purchasers. The Verallia acquisition will
“more than overcome any possible regulatory concerns” with the
plant sale, it said.  Richard Schwed , an attorney for Luxembourg-based Ardagh,
said at today’s hearing that the FTC has gone “radio silent”
on the proposal to sell the plants.  The FTC filed an administrative complaint against Ardagh
and Courbevoie, France-based Saint-Gobain this year and is
seeking an order from U.S. District Judge Barbara Jacobs Rothstein to block the deal. Rothstein urged both sides to talk
about Ardagh’s plant divestiture.  The case is U.S. Federal Trade Commission v. Ardagh Group
SA, 13-cv-01021, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
