Kabel Deutschland  AG, the cable
company being acquired by  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , abandoned a
takeover bid for smaller rival Tele Columbus Group that was
challenged by German regulators.  Kabel Deutschland dropped its appeal against antitrust
authorities’ February decision to block its takeover of Tele
Columbus, Marco Gassen, a Kabel spokesman in Unterfoehring,
Germany, said by telephone today.  “The success of Vodafone’s takeover bid means the
competitive conditions have changed,” Gassen said. “Pursuing a
probably time-consuming court case no longer makes any sense.”  Vodafone plans to complete its 7.7 billion-euro ($10.4
billion) takeover of Kabel Deutschland next month after a
majority of the German company’s shareholders accepted the deal
and the European Commission gave its approval. The purchase is a
key tenet of Newbury, England-based Vodafone’s ambition to
expand beyond wireless service.  Liberty Global Plc. (LBTYA) ’s antitrust clearance to buy cable
operator Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmbH was last month overturned
by a Dusseldorf court that said the competition authority didn’t
demand tough enough concessions.  Reuters reported Kabel Deutschland’s decision to withdraw
its appeal earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
