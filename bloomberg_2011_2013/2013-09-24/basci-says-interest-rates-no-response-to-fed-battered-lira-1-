Turkey ’s central bank will only
increase interest rates if it sees two-year inflation
expectations worsening, Governor Erdem Basci said.  Basci said today he’s providing short-term forward guidance
to end a “vicious circle” of market bets that the central bank
would respond to volatility in the lira. In an interview with
the state-run Anatolia news agency Aug. 27, he pledged not to
change  interest rates  this year, and said the lira could
appreciate to 1.92 per dollar by year-end. The bank will rely on
gross foreign exchange reserves of $127 billion to defend the
currency if needed, he said today.  “Extra monetary tightening might only be implemented if we
see a danger to the inflation outlook for 24 months from now,”
Basci said at a meeting with industrialists in the city of
Denizli in southwestern Turkey. “We currently think that we did
more tightening beyond what is necessary. But our hands are not
tied. If we need to take a step, the monetary policy committee
will consider this.”  Basci is seeking to  break the link  between domestic and
global borrowing costs, according to a presentation on the
Ankara-based central bank’s website on Sept. 19. Rates began
climbing in May, sending Turkish note yields up by the most in
 emerging markets , as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
signaled his debt-buying program could be curtailed.  Basci’s pledge to keep borrowing costs low may enable the
economy to gather steam after growth slowed for seven straight
quarters through the end of last year. The  economy  expanded by
4.4 percent in the second quarter, following 2.9 percent growth
in the first three months.  Lira Falls  The Fed unexpectedly maintained the pace of stimulus at
last week’s meeting. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
say tapering will probably begin in December.  Investors are betting Basci won’t be able to keep his
pledge. Turkey’s benchmark rate will probably be increased
to at least 6.25 percent from 4.5 percent by year-end, according
to HSBC Holdings Plc indexes calculated using trading in
 interest-rate swaps .  The lira fell 0.6 percent to 1.9980 at 2:18 p.m. today to
become the worst performing emerging-market currency in  Europe ,
 Africa  and the  Middle East  after the Hungarian forint, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Hungary ’s central bank cut its
benchmark  interest rate  to a record low today after inflation
slowed and following the Fed decision last week.  Yields on two-year lira notes increased 4 basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 8 percent, compared to an all-time low
of 4.79 percent on May 17.  Capital Reversal  Countries with large current-account deficits were most
affected by the Fed-triggered selloff, Basci said. While
Turkey’s gap swelled to $42 billion in the first seven months of
this year from $34 billion a year earlier, it’s narrowing if
gold imports are excluded, Basci said.  Turkey will finance the deficit without difficulty despite
volatility in capital flows and foreign capital has begun to
flow back into Turkish bonds and foreign-exchange markets this
month, he said.  The bank’s year-end inflation forecast of 6.2 percent
assumed the lira trading at 1.92 to a dollar, according to the
governor. The forecast may not be met as a weaker currency lifts
consumer prices, Basci said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
