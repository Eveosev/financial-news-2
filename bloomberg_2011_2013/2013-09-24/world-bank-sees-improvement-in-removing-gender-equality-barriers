The removal of barriers to gender
equality in several West African countries is the latest sign of
a global improvement in women’s legal status over 50 years, a
World Bank  report  showed.  In the last two years, 44 economies took 48 measures
improving women’s opportunities and no measures worsening parity
were adopted, according to the bank’s biannual Women, Business
and the Law report. Ivory Coast and  Mali  were among the four
countries where the most changes occurred, while Togo also took
action, it said.  “That’s three countries in this region, that to me
signifies there is a trend and momentum moving in this
direction,” lead author Sarah Iqbal said in a telephone
interview. Globally, “we have come a long way but there’s a lot
that remains to be done.”  While the bank’s database shows that half of legal
restrictions on women in place in 1960 were removed by 2010,
almost 90 percent of countries covered by the report still
currently have at least one discriminatory measure, it said.
Such hurdles are making it more complicated for women to enter
the workforce, even though adding women to the labor market
could boost growth from  Egypt  to  Italy , the International
Monetary Fund said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
