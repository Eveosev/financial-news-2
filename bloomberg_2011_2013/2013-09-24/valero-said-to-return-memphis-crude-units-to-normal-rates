Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  has returned
the two crude units at its Memphis  refinery  to normal rates
while other units remain at limited rates or on circulation, a
person familiar with operations said.  The two crude units have a total capacity of about 180,000
barrels a day. A hydrotreater is also back to normal, said the
person, who asked not to be named because the information is not
public. The 100,000-barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker is
running at 42,000 barrels a day while repairs are being made on
a sulfur recovery unit, the person said.  The refinery has been at lower rates since the sulfur unit
was damaged during a power failure on Sept. 15 that shut the
majority of the production units, the person said.  Bill Day, a spokesman for the company in San Antonio, did
not immediate respond to an e-mail or voice mail seeking
comment. Day said on Sept. 19 that all production units at
 Memphis  were in operation, and declined to comment on rates.  A sulfur recovery unit captures and holds sulfur that is
removed in the desulfurization process.  The plant, which can process 195,000 barrels a day of crude
and other feedstocks, uses primarily light and sweet crude oil
delivered by the Capline pipeline, according to Valeroâ€™s
 website . Capline runs from St. James, Louisiana, to Patoka,
 Illinois .  To contact the reporter on this story:
