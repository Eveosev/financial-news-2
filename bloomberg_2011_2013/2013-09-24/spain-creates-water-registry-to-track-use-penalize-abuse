Spain formed a national registry to
compile data on who uses publicly owned water, from wells and
rivers to supplies derived from recycling or desalination.  The 42-page law published yesterday says it seeks to be “a
fundamental tool to compile statistics on legally contracted
supplies as well as to help manage the public water system.”  The law takes on some of the regulatory tasks currently in
the hands of regional hydrographic agencies and sets rules for
fining abuse, such as illegal well-drilling or theft from
rivers, a persistent issue in one of Western Europe’s driest
nations.  The value of damage to the public water system was defined
as the “economic value of the goods illegally gotten,” which
must include the economic value of what’s “extracted, damaged
or destroyed.” Rules also extend to illegal removal of trees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
