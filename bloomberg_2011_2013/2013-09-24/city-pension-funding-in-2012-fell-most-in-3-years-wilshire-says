U.S. city and county pensions had
69 percent of assets required to meet obligations to retirees in
fiscal 2012, an 11 percentage point drop from the prior year,
according to Wilshire Consulting.  Funding levels for more than 100 retirement systems
reviewed by Santa Monica, California-based Wilshire fell as the
 European debt crisis  and a slowing global economy depressed
stock returns. It was the steepest decline in funding since
fiscal 2009.  “This deterioration in funding ratio was fueled by global
stock market volatility” in the year through June 2012,
Wilshire said in a release.  Of the 105 city and county retirement systems that reported
data for 2012, 92 percent are underfunded, according to
Wilshire.  U.S. state and local-government pension investments ended
the year through June 2012 with a median gain of 1.15 percent,
Wilshire reported in August 2012. Assets bounced back in fiscal
2013 as pensions booked a median gain of 12.4 percent. City and
county pensions allocated an average 61 percent of assets to
stocks, real estate and private equity, according to Wilshire.  For the 105 systems that reported actuarial data on or
after June 30, 2012, pension assets were $387 billion, a gain of
2 percent from the prior year, Wilshire said. Liabilities grew
16 percent to $560.6 billion.  Wilshire forecasts a long-term annual median return on city
and county pension assets of 6.7 percent, below the median
assumption of 7.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
