Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
President  Sandra Pianalto  said the central bank is working to
improve the speed and security of the U.S. payments system.  “At the heart of the strategy is a vision to improve the
end-to-end speed, efficiency, and safety of the US payments
system over the next decade,” Pianalto said today in a speech
in Chicago.  The central bank oversees the nation’s payment system,
which handles more than $3 trillion a day to pay for goods,
services and financial instruments, according to the central
bank. The Fed is currently in the process of seeking public
comments on the weaknesses of the system, including its
inability to process transactions in near-real-time.  “Our vision is that most payments will be executed in real
time,” she said at the  Chicago  Payments Symposium, hosted by
the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. “This would mean that any
consumer or business would be able to make an immediate payment
to anyone, electronically and conveniently.”  She did not discuss the outlook for the economy or monetary
policy in her remarks.  Pianalto, 59, the longest-serving regional Fed bank
president, said in August that she will retire early next year.
Fed presidents rotate voting on monetary policy, with the
Cleveland Fed holding a voting seat next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
