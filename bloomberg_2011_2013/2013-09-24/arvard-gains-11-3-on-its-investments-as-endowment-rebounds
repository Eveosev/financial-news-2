Harvard University , which last week
introduced the largest capital campaign in the history of higher
education, gained 11.3 percent on its investments in the year
through June as the size of the endowment grew to $32.7 billion.  Harvard, the world’s wealthiest school, said it beat its
benchmark and generated an additional $600 million on U.S. and
foreign public equities as well as  hedge funds . The Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based university, which posted a record 27 percent
loss in the year through June 30, 2009, said that over 10 years
it has gained on average 9.4 percent annually.  “I am very proud of the internal and external managers we
have in place and the results they have achieved,” Jane Mendillo, chief executive officer of Harvard Management Co., the
university entity that oversees investments, said in a report.
“We have made a strong recovery since the global economic
downturn of 2008-2009.”  Harvard is among the universities still fighting to recoup
all of the investment losses from the global credit crisis.
While it is still the wealthiest, the endowment peaked in value
at $36.9 billion before the losses posted in 2009. Last year it
lost 0.05 percent.  While Harvard and other elite schools for years generated
superior returns by aggressively expanding investments in
alternative assets such as private equity and hedge funds, the
gain this year is largely in line with others.  Foundations and endowments as a group had a one-year median
return of 11.28 percent for the 12 months ended June 30,
Wilshire Associates said in an Aug. 6 report. That’s up from an
annual increase of 0.38 percent through June 30, 2012.  Yale’s Gains  Yale University , which under the tutelage of Chief
Investment Officer  David Swensen  is also credited with remaking
endowment management to favor less liquid assets, said today it
gained 12.5 percent through June 30. The university in  New
Haven ,  Connecticut , said it has a target allocation of 31
percent for private equity, 20 percent for hedge funds and 6
percent for domestic equity markets.  The Philadelphia-based  University of Pennsylvania  on Sept.
19 reported a 14.4 percent return on its investments in fiscal
2012, up from a 1.6 percent gain a year earlier. The
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology , which is also in
Cambridge, recently said its endowment grew to a record $10.9
billion after an 11.1 percent increase on investments.  Equity Markets  “This was a year in which it paid to be in public equity
and developed markets,” said Max Senter, a managing director at
Cambridge Associates LLC, a Boston-based research and consulting
firm. “It was a big up year for U.S. equity and for big
European countries and  Japan .”  Mendillo said in the report released today that domestic
equities gained 26.6 percent for the year while foreign equities
were up 20.5 percent. The university’s hedge fund portfolio was
up 13.2 percent, compared with a benchmark of 6.8 percent.
Private equity returned 11 percent and over the last decade has
failed to outperform publicly traded stocks, she said.  The university remains optimistic about  emerging markets 
despite gaining only 2.3 percent for the year, Mendillo said.
Harvard also liquidated $600 million of its timberland portfolio
even as it expanded its holdings of so-called real assets.  Harvard on Sept. 21 announced a $6.5 billion capital
campaign to raise additional funds for research, teaching,
renovating dormitories and resuming construction stalled by
losses from the credit crisis. The University of  Southern
California  had set the previous record target for a $6 billion
campaign that began in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
