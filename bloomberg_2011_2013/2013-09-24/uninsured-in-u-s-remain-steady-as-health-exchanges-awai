There was little shift in the share
of people in the U.S without health insurance in the first
quarter of 2013, a trend likely to change when new coverage
marketplaces open next month as part of the health overhaul law.  Forty-six million people didn’t have health insurance in
the first quarter of the year and 57 million people, or 19
percent of the U.S., were without coverage at some point in the
prior 12 months, according to a survey by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.  That represents almost no difference from a year earlier,
the CDC said in a report released today. The figures are
expected to change when new insurance marketplaces open Oct. 1
as the U.S. begins the biggest expansion of health-care coverage
since the 1960s under the  2010 Affordable Care Act .
Congressional analysts project the online markets, called
exchanges, will attract about 7 million people in their debut.
The exchanges will provide subsidies for people whose  incomes
are less than 400 percent  of the federal poverty level.  The biggest coverage shift was with people the Atlanta-based CDC calls the near-poor, or those with incomes of 100
percent to 200 percent of the  federal poverty level . For a
single person, that’s $11,490 to $22,980; for a family of four,
$23,550 to $47,100.  While about the same percentage of near-poor people were
covered, fewer had private insurance, according to the CDC.
Instead, more people in this income group used government
coverage, including the federal-state Medicaid program for the
poor or Medicare, the U.S. plan for the elderly and disabled.
Among people 18 to 64 years old, 28 percent were part of public
insurance plans in the first quarter of 2013, compared with 25
percent in 2012.  The health-care overhaul  expands Medicaid  to 138 percent of
federal poverty, in states that have agreed to do so.  Medicare enrollment rose to 48.9 million in 2012 last year,
a 2 million-person increase from 2011 that was greater than
gains in any other type of health plan, government or private,
the Census Bureau reported Sept. 17. While 171 million people
still get coverage through employers, the share with private
plans fell to 54.9 percent, from 55.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
