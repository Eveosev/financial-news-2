Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA)  Chief Executive
Officer Mike Fries, who runs one of the world’s biggest cable
companies, said he doesn’t expect Apple Inc. to sell its own
television, disputing speculation among analysts.  “I don’t think Apple is going to build a TV,” Fries said
today at an investment conference in New York. Apple instead is
talking to U.S. cable providers about revamping the interface
for pay-TV services, he said.  Analysts such as Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray Cos. and
 Brian White  of Cantor Fitzgerald have predicted Apple will
release a television set, vaulting the company into a new
market. Until now, its TV efforts have been limited to a $100
Internet-connected set-top box that streams video from providers
such as Netflix Inc., Google Inc.’s YouTube, Hulu LLC and
Apple’s own iTunes.  The company has been beefing up what is available via Apple
TV in recent months by striking deals with  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s
ESPN and  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ’s HBO. Apple also has been negotiating
with Time Warner Cable Inc. to give subscribers of the cable
service access to their channels via Apple TV, people familiar
with the talks have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
