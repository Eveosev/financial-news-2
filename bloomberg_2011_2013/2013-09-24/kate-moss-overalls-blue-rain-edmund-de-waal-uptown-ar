A turquoise bear is ready to drop onto his colorful siblings from the ceiling of 909 Madison Avenue, the new building Galerie Perrotin shares with Dominique Levy.  Made of foam, plastic and feathers, the eight life-size creatures are by the Italian artist  Paola Pivi , whose playfulness extends to titles such as “Mama no more diapers, please” for a pink bear cub in a happy-baby pose.  From Perrotin it’s one flight up to Levy’s realm and a more-serious scene. The rooms are filled with stunning concetti spaziali (“spatial concepts”) by Fontana, blue Klein sculptures and paintings, and rare Twomblys on loan from the Eli and Edythe L. Broad Collection and the Museum of  Modern Art .  Don’t miss Klein’s 1961 installation “Pluie Bleue,” consisting of a tidy rectangular coat of blue pigment on the ground with thin sticks of blue rain suspended above it.  The bears are $90,000. Paola Pivi runs through Oct. 26; +1-212-812-2902;  http://www.perrotin.com . ”Audible Presence” runs through Nov. 16; +1-212-772-2004;  http://www.dominique-levy.com .  Here are some more shows on Manhattan’s Upper East Side:  Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld Gallery  Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld’s striking new space on 78th Street is filled with good-looking characters. There’s  Kate Moss  wearing overalls, Linda Evangelista in an unbuttoned white shirt,  Uma Thurman  intensely gazing at her own reflection, among many others -- all captured by  Peter Lindbergh . The prints are mostly editions of 3 or 25 and very large. Prices are $16,500 to $200,000. Through Oct. 4 at 5A E. 78th St.; +1-212-242-2905;  http://vladimirrestoinroitfeld.com .  Gagosian  Black and white vitrines filled with hundreds of porcelain pots, a modern take on an ancient medium, fill Gagosian’s space on Madison Avenue. They’re the work of ceramic artist Edmund de Waal, acclaimed author of the wonderful “Hare With Amber Eyes,” a family biography that retraces the adventures of a collection of netsuke from late-19th-century Paris to wartime Vienna and finally  Tokyo  during the U.S. Occupation. Through Oct. 19 at 980 Madison Ave.; +1-212-744-2313;  http://www.gagosian.com .  McCaffrey Fine Art  In his late years, between 1976 and 1986, British artist William Scott revisited still-life subjects: fish, string beans, cups, pipes. The 26 works at McCaffrey Fine Art are charming and ironic. The fish, on white plates, look alert and ready to swim off to freedom. Prices are 75,000 pounds ($120,000) to 150,000 pounds. Through Oct. 26 at 23 E. 67th St.; +1-212-988-2200;  http://mccaffreyfineart.com .  Castelli Gallery  In “Recent Work,” Richard Pettibone appropriates well-known pieces by famous artists, a practice he has been exploring since the 1960s. There’s  Jasper Johns ’s “Light Bulb,”  Frank Stella ’s ”The Marriage of Reason and Squalor” and Picasso’s “Guitar.” Pettibone also pairs works together; Brancusi’s “Newborn” from 1915 shares the canvas with Duchamp’s “Fountain.” Through Oct. 22 at 18 E. 77th St.; +1-212-249-4470;  http://www.castelligallery.com .  Michael Werner  Boisterous works by Peter Doig,  Sigmar Polke , Peter Saul and  Michael Williams  are on view in a group show bringing together well-known artists with younger ones. Their works share a busy canvas and buoyant colors -- in Polke’s words: “Not to be shocking means to agree to be furniture.” Through Nov. 2 at 4 E. 77th St.; +1-212-988-1623;  http://www.michaelwerner.com .  Muse highlights include Philip Boroff on  Broadway , John Detrixhe on  travel .  To contact the reporter on this story: Lili Rosboch in  New York  at  erosboch2@bloomberg.net .
