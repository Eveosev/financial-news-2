Hudson’s Bay Co. (HBAYF) , Canada’s biggest
department-store operator, proposed the interest rate on a $1.9
billion, seven-year  term loan  it’s seeking to support its
purchase of luxury retailer  Saks Inc. (SKS) , according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  The covenant-light loan, meaning there are no financial-maintenance requirements, may pay interest at 3.25 percentage
points to 3.5 percentage points more than the London interbank
offered rate, with a 1 percent minimum on the lending benchmark,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
terms aren’t public.  Lenders are offered the debt at 99 cents on the dollar, the
person said, reducing proceeds for the borrower and boosting the
yield for investors. Bank of America Corp. and Royal Bank of
 Canada  are arranging the financing and request lenders submit
commitments by Oct. 3, the person said.  Hudson’s Bay agreed to buy New York-based Saks for $2.4
billion. The transaction includes a $900 million unsecured
bridge portion, according to a July 29 regulatory filing.  Bridge facilities are short-term loans that usually mature
in one year and are often used as backstops to bond offerings or
longer-dated bank debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
