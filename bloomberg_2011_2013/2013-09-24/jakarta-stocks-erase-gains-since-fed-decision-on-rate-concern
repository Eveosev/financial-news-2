The  Jakarta Composite Index (JCI)  fell
the most in a month, erasing a rally since the Federal Reserve’s
decision last week to maintain stimulus, amid concern  Bank
Indonesia  will tighten monetary policy further.  The index fell 2.3 percent to 4,460.413 at the close, the
biggest drop since Aug. 27. The gauge has lost 210 points in
three days, wiping out the 207.5-point gain on Sept. 19 after
the Fed decided not to taper $85 billion in monthly bond
purchases.  PT Astra International (ASII) , the top auto retailer, lost
6.6 percent, the most since October 2011. Property developer  PT
Lippo Karawaci (LPKR)  slid 7 percent, the worst performer on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index.  Bank Indonesia has raised its  benchmark interest rate  by
1.5 percentage points since June to 7.25 percent to support the
rupiah, which fell to the lowest level since April 2009 today.
The currency erased last week’s 0.5 percent advance, which was
spurred by the Fed’s decision.  “There’s concern that Bank Indonesia will raise rates
again,” Jeffrosenberg Tan, a  money manager  at PT Sinarmas Asset
Management, said by phone from Jakarta. “The market will remain
volatile as long as the rupiah does not stabilize.”  The  Jakarta index  has declined 14 percent since May 22 when
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first flagged a potential paring of
stimulus.  Foreign investors  have since pulled $3.2 billion from
local equities, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The stock index is valued at 13.5 times 12-month projected
earnings, compared with 10.6 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Valuations for
Indonesian stocks have fallen from this year’s high of 15.9
times on May 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
