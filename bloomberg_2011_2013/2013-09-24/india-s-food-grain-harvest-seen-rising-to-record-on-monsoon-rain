India, the world’s second-biggest
grower of rice and wheat, may produce a record quantity of food
grains in the 2013-14 season as planting expands after monsoon
rains covered the entire nation early, Agriculture Minister
 Sharad Pawar  said.  The “current year is good for agriculture,” Pawar said
today at a meeting of officials and farm scientists in New Delhi
to discuss plans for winter-sown crops. “Almost all parts of
the country have received very good rainfall. The initial
estimates are always conservative.” Food-grain output reached
an all-time high of 259.29 million metric tons in 2011-12,
according to farm ministry data.  Higher food-grain output would allow the nation to continue
exports of wheat and rice and help curb global food costs that
the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization says fell in
eight of the past 11 months. Agriculture’s share of total Indian
exports increased to 13.8 percent in 2012-13 from 10.2 percent
in 2008-09, Pawar said.  “India will continue to export the commodities which are
in surplus, and it may even export more than the previous
year,” Faiyaz Hudani, an associate vice president at Kotak
Commodity Services Ltd. in Mumbai, said by phone. “It is not
only Indian production which will determine exports, it is also
the international market that determines how much quantity can
be shipped.”  More Rain  Monsoon rainfall in the three months through August was the
highest since 1994, data from the  India Meteorological
Department  showed. Rains since June 1 exceeded the average by 5
percent as of yesterday, according to the weather bureau.  Production of monsoon-sown food grains, which also include
corn, barley and lentils, is estimated to rise to 129.3 million
tons in the year begun July 1, compared with 128.2 million tons
in the prior period, Pawar said as he released the first
official estimates of 2013-14 crop output. The government
updates the estimates every three months.  Production of monsoon-sown rice in India may be 92.3
million tons for 2013-14, Pawar said. Though rice output is seen
trailing last year, it will improve in subsequent estimates,
according to the minister. A dry September would help the rice
crop mature well in  India ’s north, Pawar said.  The nation may harvest record quantities of cotton,
soybeans and corn, he said. Production of monsoon-sown oilseeds
may increase to 23.96 million tons from 20.86 million tons a
year ago, while soybean output is likely to be 15.68 million
tons from 14.67 million tons. The corn harvest is poised to
climb to 17.78 million tons, compared with 16.04 million tons a
year earlier, while cotton output may come to 35.3 million bales
of 170 kilograms (374 pounds) each.  Sugar-cane production is set to rise to 341.77 million tons
from 338.96 million tons a year ago even as planting drops, the
farm minister said. Farmers sowed cane on 4.87 million hectares
(12 million acres) as of Sept. 20, compared with 5 million
hectares a year earlier, according to the agriculture ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
