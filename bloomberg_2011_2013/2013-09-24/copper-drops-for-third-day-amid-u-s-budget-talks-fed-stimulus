Copper declined for a third day
amid a political showdown in Washington over the U.S. budget and
as investors examined speeches from Federal Reserve officials
for clues on monetary policy.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to $7,201 a metric ton and
traded at $7,216 by 10:21 a.m. in Tokyo. Copper has dropped 9
percent this year.  House Speaker  John Boehner  and his Republican caucus are
pushing the federal government closer to a shutdown in a fight
over funding and the debt limit, Democrats  Max Baucus  and  Patty
Murray  said in a letter to colleagues yesterday. Investors are
considering these political disagreements one week after the Fed
unexpectedly maintained $85 billion a month in bond purchases.
The U.S. is the second-biggest consumer of industrial metals.  “Concern over the U.S. fiscal situation has damped market
sentiment amid a lack of fresh buying incentive before next
week’s Chinese holidays,” said  Tetsu Emori , the chief fund
manager at Astmax Asset Management Inc. Markets in China, the
world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals, will be closed
from Oct. 1 to Oct. 7 for the National Day holidays.  The metal delivery in December on Shanghai Futures Exchange
was little changed at 52,020  yuan  ($8,498) a ton. Futures for
delivery in December slid 0.4 percent to $3.2865 a pound on the
Comex in New York.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel declined and tin
had yet to trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
