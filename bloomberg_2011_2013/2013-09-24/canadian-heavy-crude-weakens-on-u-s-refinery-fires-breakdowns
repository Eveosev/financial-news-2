Canadian heavy  crude oil  weakened
on the  spot market  after two refineries in the U.S. reported
fires and a third shut equipment, potentially reducing demand
for imports.  Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  said its Galveston Bay, Texas,
 plant  had a fire in a hydrotreater yesterday, and  Northern Tier
Energy LP (NTI)  said a fire in a crude unit at a St. Paul Park,
Minnesota, over the weekend will cause it to shut operations for
three to four weeks.  BP Plc (BP/)  said today it closed a sulfur
recovery complex at the Toledo, Ohio,  plant  after a breakdown.  Western Canadian Select heavy crude for November delivery
weakened by $1 a barrel to a $30 discount to U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate, according to Calgary oil broker Net Energy
Inc. Trades were made outside of the November index period that
begins Oct. 1, when the average price for November exports is
set and most of the spot volume for the month trades.  Conventional Canadian light, sweet oil at  Edmonton  also
weakened, falling $2.25 a barrel against WTI to a $12.50
discount, Net Energy said. Syncrude, a light oil produced from
heavy oil-sands bitumen, was unchanged at a $3-a-barrel discount
for November delivery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
