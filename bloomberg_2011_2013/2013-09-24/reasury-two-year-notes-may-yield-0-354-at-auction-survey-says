The Treasury Department’s $33
billion sale of two-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.354
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in September 2015, yielded
0.36 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New
York  time. Last month’s sale of the securities yielded 0.386
percent and the record auction low was 0.220  percent  on July 24,
2012.  The size of today’s offering is the second straight $1
billion monthly  cut in issuance , the most since October 2010.
Before the reductions, the Treasury sold $35 billion at 34
straight sales of the notes. The securities peaked at $44
billion from October 2009 through April 2010.  The Aug. 27 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
3.21, up from 3.08 the previous month. The average ratio for the
past 10 auctions was 3.4.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 19.3 percent of the notes at the
August sale. The average for the past 10 auctions is 24.1
percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 26.1 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 22.6
percent at the past 10 sales.  Two-year notes have gained 0.2 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 2.9 percent by Treasuries overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The two-year
securities returned 0.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $97 billion. The government will sell $35 billion
in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion in seven-year
securities on Sept. 26  The sales this week, along with last week’s $13 billion 10-year TIPS auction, will raise $47.6 billion of new cash, as
maturing securities held by the public total $62.3 billion,
according to the Treasury.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
