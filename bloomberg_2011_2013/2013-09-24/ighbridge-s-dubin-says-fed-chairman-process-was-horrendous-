Glenn Dubin, co-founder of
investment firm Highbridge Capital Management LLC, said the
White House mishandled the nomination for the chairman of the
U.S.  Federal Reserve  and that former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers would have made a “great” chairman  “I think the process, specifically talking about  Larry
Summers  and the decision to not move forward with him as Fed
chairman, is horrendous,” Dubin said at the Bloomberg Markets
50 Summit in New York today. “He was hung out to dry.”  Summers, citing a possible “acrimonious” confirmation
process, withdrew his name from consideration for the post this
month in the face of opposition from several members of the
Senate Banking Committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
