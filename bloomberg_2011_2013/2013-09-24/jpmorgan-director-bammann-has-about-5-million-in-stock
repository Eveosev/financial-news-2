Linda Bammann, a former  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  executive who joined the company’s board last week,
has almost $5 million of the bank’s shares, according to a
regulatory  filing  today.  Bammann, 57, owns 98,486 JPMorgan shares, according to a
securities filing today. The stake is worth $4.96 million at
today’s  closing price  of $50.32 in New York.  JPMorgan, the biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, elected Bammann
to the board effective Sept. 16. She was chief risk management
officer at Bank One Corp. from 2001 until the lender, then run
by Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon , was sold to JPMorgan in
2004. Bammann became deputy head of risk management at New York-based JPMorgan, where Dimon is now chairman and CEO, until her
retirement in 2005.  Bammann also has call options on 32,500 shares with strike
prices between $47 and $50 per share, according to the filing.
Options on an additional 15,000 shares with a strike price of
$55 expired unexercised on Sept. 21, the filing shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
