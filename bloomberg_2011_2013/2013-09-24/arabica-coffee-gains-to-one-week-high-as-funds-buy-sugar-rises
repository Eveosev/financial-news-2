Sugar futures climbed to the highest in more than five months on concern that rains will limit supplies from  Brazil , the world’s biggest producer and exporter. Cotton, coffee and orange juice rose. Cocoa slid.  Rains this week in  Sao Paulo , the main-growing state in the South American nation, will hinder the current sugar-cane harvest and may reduce yields, Somar Meteorologia said yesterday in an e-mailed report. Precipitation also hampered fieldwork last week, according to the forecaster. Sugar output in the Center South, the top producing region, fell 5.6 percent in Sept. 1-15, Unica, a Sao Paulo-based industry group, said today.  “The rain is definitely going to hold down the crush for the second half of September,” supporting prices, Alex Oliveira, a trader with Newedge Group in  New York , said in a telephone interview.  Raw sugar for March delivery rose 1 percent to settle at 17.93 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, after reaching 17.96 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since April 12.  Cotton futures for December delivery advanced 0.1 percent to 84.38 cents a pound, the first gain in four sessions.  Pakistan  cut its crop estimate 5.5 percent as sowing declined. The country is the world’s fourth-largest producer after China, India and the U.S.  “Anytime that you reduce world production, it helps prices,”  Sid Love , the president of Joe Kropf & Sid Love Consulting Services in  Overland Park ,  Kansas , said in a telephone interview.  Arabica-coffee futures for delivery in December added 0.7 percent to $1.1785 a pound on ICE.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 1 percent to $1.276 a pound, the third straight advance.  Cocoa futures for delivery in December fell 0.3 percent to $2,603 a metric ton.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marvin G.
