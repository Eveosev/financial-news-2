Most  Indian (SENSEX)  stocks climbed
following the benchmark index’s biggest two-day drop in a month.  Engineering company  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT)  rose, helping a
gauge of 20 capital-goods producers to its first gain in three
days.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  added 1.8 percent, sending the
S&P BSE  India  Auto Index towards its biggest advance since Sept.
19.  State Bank of India  retreated for the third day after
Moody’s Investors Service cut the lender’s credit rating.  Two stocks climbed for every one that fell on the S&P BSE
Sensex, which rose 0.5 percent to 20,001.90 as of 10:04 a.m. in
Mumbai. Volume was 28 percent below the 30-day average for this
time of day. The 30-stock gauge slumped 3.6 percent in the past
two days after the  Reserve Bank of India  raised the  repurchase
rate  last week for the first time in two years. The index’s  30-day volatility , a measure of price swings, climbed to the
highest level since August 2009 yesterday.  Overseas investors  bought a net $215 million of domestic
shares on Sept. 20, data from the regulator show. That took this
year’s net inflow to $13.4 billion, the second-highest among 10
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. They pulled $3.7 billion
from local equities in the three months to Aug. 31 as capital
fled  emerging markets  amid speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve
would curtail economic stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
