Army baseball coach Joe Sottolano
was fired after 14 seasons for failure to adhere to the U.S.
Military Academy’s behavior code.  Army Athletic Director Boo Corrigan said in a  statement 
that Sottolano was immediately terminated “due to behavior that
does not meet the standards of what we demand of our senior
leaders and role models at  West Point .” He didn’t elaborate on
the nature of Sottolano’s behavior.  Sottolano had been the Black Knights’ coach since 2000 and
guided the team to the regionals of the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament five times in the past 10 years.
Army, based in West Point, New York, set a school record with 41
wins in 2012 and went 29-23 this past season.  Associate head coach Matt Reid will take over on an interim
basis for Sottolano, who had a 391-286-5 record at Army.  “We have a great deal of faith and confidence in Matt’s
ability to serve as an outstanding coach, mentor and role model
for our cadet-athletes,” Corrigan said. “Matt has played a
large role in the success our team has enjoyed in recent years
and we expect to challenge for another Patriot League
championship under his guidance this spring.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
