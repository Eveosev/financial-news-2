Brazil ’s real erased losses and
climbed to a one-week high after central bank President
Alexandre Tombini said intervention will stay in effect.  The currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.1918 per  U.S.
dollar  at 2:02 p.m. in Sao Paulo, the strongest level since
Sept. 18. Swap rates due in January 2015 fell six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 10.03 percent.  Tombini said in testimony before the Senate today that the
central bank’s $60 billion currency intervention program has had
positive results. The real has advanced 11 percent since Aug.
22, when Brazil announced currency-swap and credit-line
auctions. That is the best performance among all of the world’s
dollar counterparts.  “The real has tended to appreciate ever since the central
bank announced its intervention program,” Hideaki Iha, a
currency trader at Fair Corretora in Sao Paulo, said in a
telephone interview. “We now have the central bank saying it
will maintain the auctions.”  Brazil’s current-account  deficit  expanded to 3.5 percent of
annual gross domestic product in the 12 months through August,
Banco Santander SA analysts Fernanda Consorte, Tatiana Pinheiro
and Adriana Dupita said in a research note today before the
report from the central bank. The deficit was 3.39 percent in
the prior month, the widest since 2002.  To contact the reporters on this story:
