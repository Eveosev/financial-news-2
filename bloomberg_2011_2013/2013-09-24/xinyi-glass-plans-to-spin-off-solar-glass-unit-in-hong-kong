Xinyi Glass Holdings Ltd. (868) , a
Chinese maker of glass products for cars and home appliances,
said it revived a plan to spin off its solar-glass business and
list the unit in  Hong Kong .  Xinyi Glass will distribute 70 percent of its holdings in
Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd. to shareholders, and retain the
remaining stake, it said in a  statement  to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today.  The spinoff plan takes place amid a trade dispute between
the U.S. and  China  over solar equipment, with both countries
imposing duties on imports. In 2011, Xinyi postponed a plan to
sell shares of its solar-glass business as global equity markets
plunged because of the debt crisis in Europe.  “The separate listing will provide Xinyi Solar with a
separate platform to raise future funds from the  capital markets 
to support its growth through continuing organic expansion as
well as acquisitions,” Xinyi Glass said in today’s statement.  Solar glass products accounted for 13.8 percent of the
company’s sales in 2012, according to Xinyi Glass’s annual
report.  Shares of Xinyi Glass fell as much as 4.8 percent after
trading resumed following a suspension pending the statement.
The stock traded hands 0.4 percent higher at HK$7.14 as of 1:50
