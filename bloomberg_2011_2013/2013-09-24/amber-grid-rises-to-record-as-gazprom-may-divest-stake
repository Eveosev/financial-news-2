Amber Grid AB surged after BNS news
service said  Russia ’s  OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  might sell its 37 percent
stake in  Lithuania ’s natural-gas transmission company to comply
with the Baltic nation’s government request.  The shares rose as much as 8.8 percent in Vilnius to 0.715
euro, the highest since trading began on Aug. 2 when Amber Grid
was spun off from gas utility Lietuvos Dujos AB. They were up
7.3 percent at 0.705 euro as of 11:07 a.m., valuing the company
at 126 million euros ($170 million), according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Lithuania’s government, which owns 18 percent of Amber
Grid, is asking Gazprom to specify how it will sell its holding
in the utility to meet European Union competition rules, BNS
reported today, citing a government spokesman. A Gazprom
official said yesterday that the state-run Russian supplier was
ready to sell its stake, according to BNS.  “Any sale would probably take place at a higher-than-market price, since preliminary estimates show the company is
worth more than its current market capitalization,” Marius Ignotas, head of equity trading at Swedbank in Vilnius, said by
e-mail.  The EU might consider helping Lithuania purchase the Amber
Grid shares from Gazprom, EU Energy Commissioner  Guenther
Oettinger  said last week. These comments also support the
shares, SEB’s Lithuanian senior broker Arvydas Jacikevicius said
by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
