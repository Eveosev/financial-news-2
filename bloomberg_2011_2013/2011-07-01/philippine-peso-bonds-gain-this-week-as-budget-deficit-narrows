The Philippine peso and bonds headed
for a second week of gains as a narrowing budget deficit stoked
investor appetite for the nation’s assets.  The shortfall narrowed to 9.54 billion pesos ($220
million) in the five months through May from 162.1 billion pesos
a year earlier, the government reported on June 29. The peso
rose along with other Asian currencies this week after Greek
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won approval from lawmakers to
implement his 78 billion-euro ($113 billion) package of budget
cuts and asset sales.  “With the background on the fiscal consolidation and
 Greece  getting a second lease of life, the recovery in our bonds
and the peso is sustainable,” said Marcelo Ayes, a senior vice
president at Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. in  Manila .  The peso strengthened 0.4 percent this week to 43.255 per
dollar as of 10 a.m. in Manila, the highest level since June 10,
according to prices from inter-dealer broker Tullett Prebon Plc.
The currency rose 0.2 percent today.  The yield on the 7 percent government bond due January 2016
fell 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, this week to
4.95 percent, according to Tradition Financial Services. The
rate increased six basis points today.  The Asian nation is aiming for a deficit of 2.6 percent of
gross domestic product next year, from a goal of 3 percent this
year, Budget Undersecretary Laura Pascua said yesterday.  Fitch Ratings  raised the country’s debt to BB+, one step
below investment grade on June 23, citing efforts to reduce the
fiscal shortfall. Moody’s Investors Service upgraded its ranking
to Ba2 on June 15, two levels away from the top ratings.  To contact the reporter for this story:
