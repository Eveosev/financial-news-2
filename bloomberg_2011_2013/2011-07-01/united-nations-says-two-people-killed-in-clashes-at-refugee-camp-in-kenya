At least two refugees were killed and
a dozen injured in rioting that broke out at the Dadaab refugee
camp after Kenyan police tried to demolish illegal structures
near a food-distribution point, the  United Nations  said.  Police fired teargas and live ammunition in the Dagahley
section of the Dadaab complex, the UN said today in a  statement .
Dadaab, about 260 miles (418 kilometers) northeast of Nairobi,
 Kenya ’s capital, is the world’s largest refugee camp. It houses
more than 370,000 people who have mainly fled from neighboring
Somalia in a space designed to host 90,000 occupants.  “Sadly, this incident is symptomatic of the pressure at
the camp amid overcrowding,” Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the
 UN High Commissioner for Refugees , said in the statement.  Conflict in Somalia and a severe drought have led to as
many as 61,000 people fleeing to Kenya this year, about a third
of them in the past two weeks, according to the UN.  Islamic militants, including al-Shabaab, have been fighting
the Somali government for the past three years and control most
of southern and central Somalia. Somalia hasn’t had a
functioning central administration since the ouster of former
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.  More than 10 million people living in parts of Djibouti,
Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and  Uganda  are facing the worst drought
conditions in six decades, the humanitarian agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
