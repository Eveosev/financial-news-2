Corn and wheat prices in  South Africa 
dropped by the maximum daily limit set by the South African
Futures Exchange as U.S. prices extended their decline.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the  South African Futures Exchange , slumped by 100 rand, or 5.6
percent, to close at 1,675 rand ($248) a metric ton in
Johannesburg. Meal made from the grain is the countryâ€™s staple
food. Corn futures in  Chicago  sank 5.1 percent.  U.S. farmers have planted 92.282 million acres of corn this
year, 1.8 percent more than projected by analysts in a Bloomberg
News survey and the second-highest planting since 1944, the
Department of Agriculture said yesterday. Stockpiles as of June
1 were 3.67 billion bushels, 12 percent higher than forecast.  Yellow corn for July delivery dropped 109 rand, or 6.2
percent, to 1,655 rand a ton in Johannesburg. The grain is used
mainly for  animal feed  in South Africa.  Wheat for December delivery declined 100 rand, or 3.6
percent, to 2,689 rand a ton. The grain fell 4.1 percent during
the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
