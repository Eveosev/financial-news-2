Tokyo Electric Power Co. started a
system for circulating water to cool spent nuclear fuel stored
in a pool at the No. 3 reactor of its crippled Fukushima Dai-
Ichi station yesterday.  A test run of the cooling system started yesterday,
Takehiro Todoroki, a spokesman at the utility known as Tepco
said by telephone today. The company plans to start similar
systems for circulating water in the spent fuel pools at the No.
1 and No. 4 reactors this month, he said.  The March 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out  power lines 
and backup generators leading to the failure of cooling systems
at the station, triggering the worldâ€™s worst nuclear disaster in
25 years. The Tokyo-based utility has been pouring water on
reactors and spent fuel rods to keep them cool.  The temperature in the spent fuel pool of the No. 2 reactor
fell to 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) from 70
degrees Celsius three days after starting a similar cooling
system  on May 31, according to Tepco.  To contact the reporters on this story:
