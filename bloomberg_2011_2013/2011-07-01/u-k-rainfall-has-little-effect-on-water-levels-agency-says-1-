Rainfall that was above normal in
June will have little or no effect on groundwater levels in the
U.K., the Environment Agency said in a report today.  Groundwater levels are below normal in parts of eastern,
southwestern and central  England  and parts of  Wales , and
probably won’t increase in the summer months, the agency said.
The counties of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire and parts of
Bedfordshire, Northamptonshire and western Norfolk are still in
a drought, according to the report.  “Most of England and Wales have received average or above
average rainfall for June so far,” the agency said. “The
recent rainfall will have little or no effect on most
groundwater levels. This is because the soil is very dry, so no
excess will percolate through to the aquifers.”  Some small streams dried up and low flows have caused the
death of a “number of fish” in central and eastern England and
boating restrictions are in place, the agency said. Water
supplies are still high enough that hosepipe restrictions
haven’t yet been introduced, according to the report.  “Some damage to crops caused by the dry spring is now
likely to be irreversible,” the agency said. “The forecast for
a return to dry weather in July will add further pressure on
water resources and we may see drought conditions spreading into
central England and further east.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
