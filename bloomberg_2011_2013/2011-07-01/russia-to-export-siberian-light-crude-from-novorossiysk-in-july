Russia plans to ship two cargoes
totaling 160,000 metric tons of Siberian Light crude from its
 Black Sea  port of Novorossiysk in July, according to a loading
schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  The worldâ€™s largest oil producer will export 3.646 million
tons of Ural from Novorossiysk, the plan showed. This will bring
total shipments from this port to 3.806 million tons, or 899,935
barrels a day, 15 percent more than June.  Exports of Siberian Light crude from Tuapse on the Black
Sea, the usual loading terminal of the grade, will drop by 36
percent to 290,000 tons in July, the plan showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
