Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Vice Chairman
Charles Munger, whose company built the largest stake in Coca-
Cola Co., said the soft-drink maker is an “easy choice” for
stock investors.  “It’s not nearly as good a business as it was 20 years
ago,” Munger said today at a meeting in Pasadena, California.
“But of the big companies that sell these kinds of  consumer
goods  it would be one of my favorites.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
