Kenya â€™s government hired an
unidentified Spanish company to conduct a feasibility study on
building a second petroleum-offloading jetty at the port of
 Mombasa , the Standard reported.  The study, which begins this month, will cost 100 million
shillings ($1.1 million) and is expected to be completed in six
months, the Nairobi-based newspaper said, citing the National
Oil Company of Kenya. A second jetty may help ease the flow of
petroleum products into the East African country, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
