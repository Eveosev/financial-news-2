Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
agreed to sell a stake in a group of U.K. commercial-property
loans with a face amount of 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) to
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) , said two people briefed on the plan.  Blackstone, based in New York, plans to buy a 25 percent
stake in the loans and take over management of the assets to try
to recover as much value as possible, according to one of the
people with knowledge of the agreement, who asked not to be
named because it wasn’t announced publicly.  The portfolio comprises 30 loans backed by collateral
including auto showrooms, nursing homes, pubs and parking
garages, one of the people said. The largest loan was made to
 Pendragon Plc (PDG) , the biggest independent operator of franchised
car dealerships in the U.K., according to the person.  Christine Anderson , a Blackstone spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the deal, which was reported yesterday by the
Financial Times.  Andy Cameron-Smith, an RBS spokesman, declined to comment
when contacted by telephone yesterday.  Blackstone, the world’s largest private-equity firm,
prevailed over bidders including Lone Star Funds and Starwood
Capital Group Global LLC, according to one of the people with
knowledge of the matter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
