BP Plc (BP/)  will drill its first deepwater
well in  Brazil  to appraise a discovery in a block acquired from
Devon Energy Corp.  BP will use the  Deep Ocean Clarion  drill ship to appraise
the Itaipu prospect at Block BM-C-32, said David Nicholas, a
spokesman at the London-based company. It will be BP’s first
deepwater well outside  Angola  since last year’s Macondo spill.  “This well is part of the appraisal plan for the
discovery, which has been approved by the Brazilian regulator,”
Nicholas said by phone today. He declined to comment on the
timetable for drilling. “It’s not the first deepwater well BP
has drilled since Macondo. We’ve drilled a number of production
wells in the deep water offshore Angola.”  BP plans to expand oil output to more than 100,000 barrels
a day in Brazil after agreeing last year to pay  Devon Energy
Corp. (DVN) , which made the discovery, about $3.2 billion for assets.  More than 4.1 million barrels of crude oil leaked from a
subsea well at the Macondo field off the Louisiana coast, after
the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank in April of
last year killing 11 people. BP took a $41.3 billion charge to
pay the costs of the disaster.  To contact the reporters on this story:
