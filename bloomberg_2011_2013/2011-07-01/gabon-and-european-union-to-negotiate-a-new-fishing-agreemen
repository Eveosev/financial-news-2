The European Union plans to start
talks with Gabon over a new fisheries agreement to replace a
six-year accord that expires on Dec. 2, the Gabonese government
said.  The EU currently pays 860,000 euros ($1.25 million) a year
to Gabon for fishing rights in its territorial waters. The
negotiations will review the quotas, the number of boats and the
financial compensation to be paid by Brussels, the government
said in a statement handed to reporters in the capital,
Libreville, today.  Gabon has 800 kilometers (497 miles) of coastline, while
its fishing industry represents about 1.2 percent of gross
domestic product.  To contact the reporter on this story:
