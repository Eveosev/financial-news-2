Peruvian bonds rose to their highest
level in more than three months after consumer prices increased
less than analysts forecast, boosting speculation the central
bank will keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged.  The yield on the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 6.31 percent at 1:49 p.m. New York time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.25 centimo
to 110.47 centimos per sol, its highest since March 18.  Slowing inflation in the Andean economy will prompt the
central bank’s board to leave its key rate at 4.25 percent for a
second straight month when it meets July 7, said  Pedro Tuesta , a
Washington-based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc. Consumer
prices rose 0.1 percent in June from May, less than the 0.15
percent median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The market feels the central bank has done its job,”
Tuesta said. “Inflation is not as bad as expected, and
commodities aren’t increasing anymore.”  Annual inflation slowed to 2.98 percent in June from 3.07
percent in May, according to the median estimate of eight
analysts. The government will publish the annual inflation data
today.  Peru’s sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.7470 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7490 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
