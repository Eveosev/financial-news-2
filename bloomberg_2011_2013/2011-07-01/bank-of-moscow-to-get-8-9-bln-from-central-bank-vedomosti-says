OAO Bank of Moscow will get 250
billion rubles ($8.9 billion) of financing from  Russia â€™s central
bank as the authorities agreed on a bailout yesterday, Vedomosti
reported.  The final size of the 10-year loan may be even more than
250 billion rubles, the newspaper said, citing unidentified
people aware of the details of the plan. The annual interest
rate will be 0.5 percent, it added.  Bank of Moscow is in the process of being acquired by
state-owned VTB Group, which will give it a loan of about
100 billion rubles, Vedomosti said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
