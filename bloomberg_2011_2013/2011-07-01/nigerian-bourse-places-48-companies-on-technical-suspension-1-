The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  placed 48
companies on technical suspension today for not submitting their
accounts for the year through December 2010 by the end of March.  Nigerian Bottling Company Plc, which bottles Coca-Cola Co.
products, Transnational Corp., which has interests in hotels,
agriculture and oil, and Dangote Flour Mills Plc are among those
affected, the Lagos-based exchange said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The stocks may still be traded, while prices will remain
unchanged during the suspension, which may last “for the next
one month, after which the exchange reserves the right to take
further action,” the statement said.  The bourse will delist companies that fail to submit their
financial statements one month after they the technical
suspension, Emmanuel Ikazoboh, former Interim Administrator of
the exchange, said on Nov. 4.  Abuses such as share-price fixing on the Nigerian exchange,
sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest, fueled a 57 percent slump
in stock prices from the start of 2008 to the end of last year.
The West African nation’s central bank used 620 billion naira
($4.1 billion) to bail out lenders and fired chief executive
officers of eight institutions after they amassed bad debts that
threatened the industry with a collapse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
