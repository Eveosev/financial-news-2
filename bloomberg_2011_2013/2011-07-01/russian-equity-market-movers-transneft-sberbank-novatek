The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose 1.9
percent to 1,698.10 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, advancing
3.9 percent this week to the highest level in more than two
months. The dollar-denominated RTS Index added 1.6 percent to
1,937.57.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  Preferred shares of OAO Transneft (TRNFP RX),  Russia ’s oil
pipeline operator, added 2 percent to 41,169 rubles, the biggest
gain since June 14. Rates for shipping crude will probably
increase by 8 percent by the end of the year, said Nikolay
Tokarev, head of the Moscow-based company. The tariff may
increase by 3 percent to 5 percent in August, he told reporters
in Atyrau,  Kazakhstan .  OAO Sberbank (SBER03 RX), Russia’s biggest lender, jumped
4.5 percent to 104.6 rubles, the biggest gain since June 3 after
Sberbank’s American depositary receipts started trading on LSE’s
International Order Book. The ADRs (SBER LI) closed at $15.10 in
 London . One ADR represents four ordinary shares.  OAO Novatek (NOTK RX), Russia’s largest non-state natural-
gas producer, surged 6.3 percent to 367.58 rubles. Natural gas
futures may climb next week as hotter-than-normal weather in the
U.S. spurs demand for the power-plant fuel, a Bloomberg News
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
