U.S. air-traffic controllers can
listen to radios and read to help stay awake during overnight
shifts, the  Federal Aviation Administration  said.  The agency for now is keeping so-called 2-2-1 schedules
that allow controllers to work two evenings, followed by two day
shifts and an overnight period, which a U.S. safety board has
said runs counter to normal sleep-wake patterns.  The FAA announced the new procedures in an agreement
reached with the controllers’ union and released today. The
agency must “make sure we have the right policies in place to
reduce the possibility of fatigue,” FAA Administrator  Randy Babbitt  said in a statement.  Nine controllers have been reported by the FAA as sleeping
or unresponsive on the job since January. An agency-union
working group established before the sleeping incidents became
public developed the steps in the  new agreement .  Workers can listen to the radio while on the job between 10
p.m. and 6 a.m. and read “appropriate” material, as traffic
permits, according to the agreement.  While there is no change in scheduling practices for now,
the agency and union will “incorporate fatigue science” for
schedules starting Sept. 1, 2012.  The  National Transportation Safety Board , which
investigates aviation accidents and makes non-binding
recommendations, told the FAA in 2007 it should work with
controllers to revise schedules. Sixty-one percent of
controllers worked schedules that opposed normal sleep-wake
patterns, the NTSB found.  Long Weekends  A schedule may look like this, the NTSB said then: The
first day, a 3 p.m. shift start; the second day, a 2 p.m. start;
the third day, 7 a.m.; the fourth day, 6 a.m., and a fifth shift
that begins at 10 p.m. on the fourth day, which allows the
workers to have a longer weekend.  The FAA and controllers are working on reducing the risk of
fatigue between the fourth and fifth shifts on those types of
schedules, according to today’s statement.  “We fully support these recommendations,” Paul Rinaldi,
president of the union, the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association, said in the FAA statement. “They are common-sense
solutions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
