South Africa  will start buying trains
to replace its fleet, which has reached the end of its useful
life and can no longer be refurbished, in March, Business Report
said, citing Passenger  Rail Agency  of South Africa spokeswoman
Nana Zenani.  The agency has interviewed 19 potential investors to help
fill the 11 billion-rand funding gap for the project, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper reported. The nationâ€™s government
has set aside 97 billion rand for the trains that will start
operating in 2015. The average age of local trains is 37 years.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
