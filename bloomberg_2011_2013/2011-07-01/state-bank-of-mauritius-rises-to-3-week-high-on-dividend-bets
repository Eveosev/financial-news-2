State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the
country’s second-largest lender by market value, climbed to a
more than three-week high on speculation the company will
increase its dividend payout.  The stock advanced 0.5 rupees, or 0.5 percent to 96.50
rupees at 11:23 a.m. in Port Louis, its highest intraday level
since June 8. A close at this price would be the highest since
April 22.  “Investors are anticipating an improved dividend for its
financial year through June,” Kishen Nadassen, a senior
research analyst at Cim Stockbrokers Ltd., said in a phone
interview. “The lender pays a single dividend each year,
announced by mid-July. We expect it to rise to 2.90 rupees a
share from 2.75 rupees last year.”  Profit climbed 4.6 percent to 1.6 billion rupees ($57
million) for the nine months through March, it said on April 28.
The lender makes up 15 percent of the 37-member SEMDEX stocks
gauge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
