Global regulators will examine the
effectiveness of national government rules protecting bank
depositors in the event that a lender fails, the Financial
Stability Board said today in a statement on its website.  National plans will be probed for “potential gaps” in the
insurance and guarantee plans that states have put in place to
shield depositors, the FSB said. These gaps could potentially
arise because of insufficient funding for reimbursement
programs, a lack of cooperation between states or low public
awareness, it said.  The so-called peer review will “take stock of existing
deposit insurance systems and of planned changes,” the board
said. Regulators “will draw lessons about the effectiveness of
reforms to systems in response to the crisis,” it said.  Nations have bolstered deposit guarantee funds as part of
their efforts to restore confidence in their banks following the
biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. Ireland was
criticized by German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  during the crisis
for unilaterally increasing the size of deposits that it
guaranteed, leading savers to shift accounts from other European
Union nations.  Governments in the 27 nation EU and lawmakers in the
European Parliament are considering legislation that would
require states to guarantee deposits of as much as 100,000 euros
($145,000) and to cut pay-out times compared to existing
arrangements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
