Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s June U.S. light-
vehicle sales rose 10 percent.  The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for an increase of 12 percent.  The figure accounts for Ford’s ownership of the Volvo car
brand in the year-ago period. Ford has since sold Volvo. Ford
excludes Volvo from its auto sales news release.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
