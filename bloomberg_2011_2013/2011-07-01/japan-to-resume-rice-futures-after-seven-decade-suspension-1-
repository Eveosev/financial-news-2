Tokyo  Grain Exchange Inc., operator
of Japan’s largest agricultural commodity bourse, has been
approved to list rice futures, resuming trade after a seven-
decade suspension.  The exchange plans to start rice trading within three
months, President Yoshiaki Watanabe told reporters in Tokyo
today, without elaborating. Rice futures were suspended in Japan
in 1939 when the government put grain production and
distribution under its control.  “I hope the market will provide benchmark rice prices and
a risk-hedging tool,” Watanabe said.  The ministry introduced an income-support program for rice
growers last year, replacing a price control system that ensured
farm incomes. The change increased volatility, raising the need
to introduce a hedging tool for producers and distributors.  The grain exchange will list yen-denominated futures
contracts, with deliverable grades including “koshihikari”,
the popular rice brand grown in  Japan , according to a statement
from the exchange last month.  Imported rice is excluded from physical delivery at the
exchange as the government maintains control over foreign
purchasing and sales, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
