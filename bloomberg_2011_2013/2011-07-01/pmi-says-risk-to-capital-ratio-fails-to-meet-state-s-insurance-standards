PMI Group Inc. (PMI) , the third-largest
U.S. mortgage insurer, said its risk-to-capital ratio was out of
compliance with standards in 16 states as of yesterday and that
the company received waivers to continue selling coverage in a
majority of those states.  The insurer is writing policies through the PMI Mortgage
Assurance Co. subsidiary in two states where the PMI Mortgage
Insurance Co. unit was unable to obtain waivers, the Walnut
Creek, California-based firm said today in a regulatory filing.  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , the U.S.-owned mortgage firms,
will permit the company to sell coverage through the PMAC
subsidiary in “certain states” through Dec. 31, PMI said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
