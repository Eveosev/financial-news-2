Piraeus Port Authority SA , operator
of  Greece â€™s largest harbor, said the removal of seven inactive
ferries from its berths may help increase revenue.  The company, known as OLP, signed a contract for 7.2
million euros ($10.5 million) for the sale and removal of the
ships, which formerly belonged to G.A. Ferries, according to a
statement on its web site.  The removal of the ferries will take place by the end of
July at the latest and free up an equal number of berths for
other vessels, OLP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
