Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators declined for the second time in
three days as shipments to the Southeast fell.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments dropped 6.5 percent to 19
million dekatherms (18.6 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in the
Southeast fell 15 percent to 3.66 million dekatherms.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences declined 12 percent
to 21 million dekatherms.  Wholesale gas at the Sonat-T1 hub, where gas is delivered
from Texas and Louisiana to the Southeast, fell 14.64 cents, or
3.3 percent, to $4.2414 per million British thermal units
yesterday on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
slid 11.22 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $4.2849 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
