India  ended day three of the second
cricket Test 34 runs ahead of the West Indies after Ishant Sharma became the fifth-youngest bowler to take 100 wickets.  Top-ranked India, which leads the best-of-three series 1-0,
was 23-0 at stumps in its second innings when bad light ended
play early.  Sharma, 22, finished with a career-best 6-55 as India
dismissed the West Indies for 190 in reply to the touring team’s
first-innings 201. Only countryman Kapil Dev, New Zealand’s
Daniel Vettori, Pakistan’s Waqar Younis and teammate  Harbhajan Singh  were younger than Sharma when they took their 100th Test
wicket.  India has never won two Tests in a series in the Caribbean.
The final match is scheduled July 6-10 in Dominica.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
