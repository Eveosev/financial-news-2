Ukraine exported 12.1 million tons of
grains in the marketing year which ended yesterday, down 43
percent from a year earlier, the country’s Agrarian
Confederation said.  Wheat accounted for 4 million tons, corn for 5 million tons
and barley for 2.7 million tons, the group said in a statement
on its website today. Grain exports in June were 1.5 million
tons.  Ukraine’s grain harvest was 39 million tons after hot and
dry weather reduced yields. The government restricted outbound
shipments of wheat, corn and barley for around seven months.
Ukraine’s grain exports are taxed from today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
