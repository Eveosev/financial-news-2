Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) ’s real
estate investment unit is in talks to buy a 50 percent stake in
the  Ark building  in Sydney from Morgan Stanley-owned  Investa
Property Group , two people with direct knowledge of matter said.  Investa, which completed the 21-story tower last year, is
seeking to raise about A$120 million ($129 million) from the
stake sale to Prudential’s Pramerica Real Estate Investors, said
one of the people, who declined to be identified because the
sale hasn’t completed. Investa’s unlisted Commercial Property
Fund, which owns the other half of the 40 Mount Street building
in North Sydney, will maintain its stake, one of the people said.  Pramerica, based in Parsippany,  New Jersey , also agreed in
April to buy an ownership stake in Investa’s 595 Collins Street
building in  Melbourne , and appointed Steve Bulloch, former head
of property for Hastings Fund Management, in May to oversee its
expansion into  Australia , according to company releases.  The talks with Sydney-based Investa over the purchase of
the Ark building stake are expected to conclude within the next
month, one of the people said. The property is 89 percent
occupied, and tenants include Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd., Vodafone
Hutchison Australia and Australian Worldwide Exploration Ltd.,
according to Investa’s website.  Emily Lee-Waldao, a spokeswoman at Investa, and Damian
Manolis, a managing director at Pramerica based in  Singapore ,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
