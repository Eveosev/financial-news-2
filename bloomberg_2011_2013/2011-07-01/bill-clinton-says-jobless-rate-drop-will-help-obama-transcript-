Former President  Bill Clinton , in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al
Hunt ,” predicted that unemployment numbers will drop faster than
expected and help President  Barack Obama  win re-election.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: Welcome to “Political Capital.” My guest is the
42nd president of the  United States , William Jefferson Clinton.  Mr. President, when you won re-election in 1996, the
unemployment rate was 5.2 percent. Barack Obama’s going to have
well over 8 percent. No president’s been re-elected with a
higher than 7.2 percent since World War II. It’s going to be a
tough slog, isn’t it.  BILL CLINTON: Well, I still believe he’ll win, and I
believe he’ll win because I think he’s got a better economic
record than he’s gotten credit for and because I think he’ll be
- have more credible positions than his opponent, if the
Republicans stay anywhere near where they are right now.  But I wouldn’t be surprised if he could actually get the
 unemployment rate  down a little faster than people think if they
will do a few basic things. If they get - if they can speed up
hiring the people that are already - where the jobs are being
offered. We talked about this, you and I. There’s more than 3
million jobs being posted today. We’re filling them half as fast
as we have in the past.  You could speed that up to normal rate, get another 2
million jobs. There’s - if you could speed up the retrofitting
of buildings, you could get another million jobs if you did it
right.  If we could clean out this mortgage - this bad mortgage
debt, if we could use the Bank of America settlement as a model
to now make sure all investors, everybody’s taken care of, so
write these mortgages down to the value of the home and clean
out the debt of the rest.  I think if you could do those three things, I wouldn’t be
surprised if you could create 50 percent more jobs than anybody
thinks is possible.  HUNT: When was the last time you talked to him about the
economy?  CLINTON: I don’t know - a few weeks ago. But I try never to
bother him. I really go out of my way not to do that. I think
you know, if he - if there’s something I can do to help or he
wants to talk, it’s fine. But when - if I have some idea, I’ll
call his national economic adviser,  Gene Sperling , who worked
with me.  HUNT: You have some familiarity -  CLINTON: Yes, or I’d call Vice President Biden because he’s
been working on all these jobs issues for some time. Or I’d talk
to Jeff Immelt on the Jobs Council because he’s interested in
the efficiency issue.  I don’t - I know he’s got a complicated, tough job. I don’t
want to complicate that.  HUNT: You’ve expressed your views about what  Washington  is
fooling around with this - with this debt ceiling, but there’s a
lot of stuff going on now.  Harry Reid  said the Senate is going
to cancel its July 4th recess as the president requested. Is now
the time that President Obama should get Speaker Boehner and
others and go to someplace like Camp David and say, “Hey, we’ve
really got to spend some intense couple days and not just meet
every third or fourth day”?  CLINTON: I don’t know enough about the state of play to
know that. I’ve told you what I think should be done. I think,
first of all, the president should tie the budget negotiations
to what he’s been doing on the economy and say there is not a
shred of evidence that settling this budget thing is the big
thing holding up the economy, and the first thing is the
economy.  We can’t have big spending cuts, and certainly not another
round of tax cuts for people in my income group, which is what
the Republicans want right now. This is - nor should we have big
tax increases right now. We shouldn’t do any of this. We should
work on the economy.  So what I’d like to do is to get - I’d like to see the
Republicans agree to go ahead and honor our debt obligations.
We’ll look foolish if we don’t pay our bills. A big honorable
country pays its bills. And we shouldn’t be playing around with
that. We incurred the debt. We ought to pay it.  HUNT: Right.  CLINTON: Now, then both sides need to come up with 10-year
plans.  HUNT: But do you have a feel that - fear that Republicans
may look at this now and say, “Hey, you know, if we don’t do
anything, the other guy’s going to get blamed. Just sitting
there and no action, a, helps us with our base, and also, if it
doesn’t help the economy, it’s going to be their (inaudible).”  CLINTON: Well, they - or they may think if we don’t do
anything, we might get blamed, but it’ll still hurt him at
election time -  HUNT: Yeah.  CLINTON: .. if the economy is not in good shape.  I don’t know. First of all, that shouldn’t - nobody should
want that. Not after all the suffering the American people have
been through. But that’s a pretty big gamble if - if they caught
- if they don’t want to be caught working for the failure of the
economy.  I wouldn’t think that would be a good thing.  HUNT: Let me try one final political question: You’ve
talked about the - the GOP field. You’ve praised some of the
candidates.  Who do you think would be the toughest Republican to face
the Democrats next year? And - and what surprise should we look
for in the next year?  CLINTON: Well, the only surprise you should look for is if
we can figure out a way - let’s let me answer that one first.  If we can find a way to clear this mortgage debt and secure
a lot of people in their homes, and all their neighbors in the
value of their homes -  HUNT: Right.  CLINTON: - if we can find a way to really make this  energy
efficiency  on existing structures work, and if we can get this
infrastructure bank going so we get manufacturing and
construction going, what - the surprise you should look for in
the next year is a lot more jobs being created than anybody
thinks right now.  HUNT: And which Republican would you least like to face -
have your party face?  CLINTON: Well, you know, I’d least like to face the one
that I most agree with, that I think is the most moderate. But
that may not be the best politics.  It’s so predictable - I mean it’s so unpredictable now. I -
you know, it’s - and I pray that every time I say something nice
- if I say something nice about Governor Huntsman, whom I think
did a good job for us in China, was a creative governor -  HUNT: Do you think he’d be the strongest candidate?  CLINTON: - or - well, I don’t know because he hasn’t told
us exactly, specifically what he wants.  HUNT: Right.  CLINTON: But I certainly am impressed with the way he
started.  I think Governor Romney’s doing a better job this time than
he did four years ago.  But I think - on the other hand, I saw Michele Bachmann
speak at that Conservative Political Action Committee, and I’ve
seen her several times since. She comes across as having vigor
and energy and believing what she says.  I don’t agree with what she’s saying, but she comes across
as real.  So I’d - I’m not - I’ve been so out of politics, I don’t
know that I know what’ll sell or what’ll be best for them.  All I can tell you is - I’ll make this prediction: Whatever
the unemployment rate is, if it doesn’t go up, if it still keeps
going down, and the policy direction stays more or less where it
is, I will be surprised if the president is not re-elected,
because I believe he has done a better job than he has gotten
credit for.  And I think a lot of the members of our party and Congress
have. And I think that, you know, fooling around with the full -
with the credit of America is not good strategy. So I - I think
he’ll make it.  But what I want more than anything else is to see him get
together and work this out, and get to work on the jobs issue.  HUNT: Mr. President, you still stand pretty sharp on
politics to most of us.  Thank you so much for being with us.  (CROSSTALK)  CLINTON: Thanks (inaudible)  HUNT: - for the rest of your Clinton Global Initiative.  CLINTON: Thank you.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
