Namibia ’s central bank sees benefits
to keeping its peg with  South Africa ’s rand and won’t abandon
the currency union, Assistant Governor Michael Mukete said.  While a “very strong  exchange rate ” reduces the
competitiveness of exports, the “costs are being outweighed by
being within the monetary union,” Mukete told central bank
officials in South Africa’s capital,  Pretoria , today. Namibia’s
diversion in  interest rates  with South Africa “should in no way
be seen as Namibia wanting to get out of the currency
arrangement,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
