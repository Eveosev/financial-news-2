European stocks were little changed
as the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index headed for the biggest
weekly rally in 10 months.  The Stoxx 600 rose less than 0.1 percent to 272.92 at 8:01
a.m. in  London . The measure has climbed 3.4 percent this week,
the most since Sept. 3, as Greek premier  George Papandreou  won
support from Parliament to implement his 78-billion euro ($113
billion) austerity plan of budget cuts, asset sales and tax
increases to avoid a default. The gauge has still lost 1.1
percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
