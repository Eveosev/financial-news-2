A Lamborghini once owned by  Paul McCartney , an Aston Martin cabriolet and a Bugatti Type 35B led
sales at a 7.2 million-pound ($11.6 million) auction as wealthy
collectors splashed out on classic cars of their youth.  Beatles fans and car collectors were lured by the 400GT 2+2
Lamborghini that last night sold to a phone bidder for 122,500
pounds with fees. It was estimated to fetch between 100,000
pounds and 120,000 pounds in the 19th annual Bonhams event at
the Goodwood Festival of Speed in West Sussex,  England .  “Collectors always like to buy the cars they grew up
with,” Dietrich Hatlapa, founder of Historic Automobile Group
International (HAGI), a London-based research company, said
before the event. “There’s been a generational shift and
wealthy people in their 40s and 50s are now pushing up the
prices of sports models from the 1960s and 70s.”  Some exceptional cars are making record prices, said
dealers. Lamborghini, along with  Aston Martin , Ferrari and
Porsche, is among a group of sports marques from the 1960s and
’70s that is rising in price at a time when the values of other
classic models remain little changed.  While other collecting areas, such as Chinese antiques,
contemporary art, wine and silver, have surged, the Historic
Automobile Group International (HAGI) Top 50 index of
exceptional classic-car prices has gained 1.47 percent this
year, lower than its average annual growth of more than 12
percent from 2003 to 2008.  Beatle History  McCartney was the 400GT’s first owner, according to three
histories of the Italian luxury carmaker, which began producing
sports models in competition with Ferrari in 1963. The four-
seater 400GT was the second model made by industrialist
Ferruccio Lamborghini. About 250 examples were made, said
Bonhams.  The Beatle may not have kept the car for more than three
years, according to Stewart Skilbeck, a Bonhams motoring
specialist, though the original log book hasn’t been retained.
The seller, Suffolk-based collector Nic Portway, acquired the
vehicle in 1979.  The sportster was originally orange, as befitted a car made
in 1967, the year of “Sergeant Pepper” and the Summer of Love,
and later given a wine-red livery.  In October, RM Auctions sold a yellow 1972 Lamborghini
Miura SV, whose first owner had been the singer  Rod Stewart , for
694,400 pounds ($1.1 million) against an upper forecast of
560,000 pounds.  Innes Ireland  The top price of yesterday’s sale was the 606,500 pounds
paid by an unidentified woman in the saleroom for a 1954 Aston
Martin DB2/4 Cabriolet that had formerly been owned by the U.K.-
born Grand Prix racing driver, Innes Ireland.  One of two such models known to have been styled by the
Italian coachbuilder Bertone, it had had originally been made
for the San Francisco-based collector Edith Field. The car was
recently restored to concours condition and valued at 500,000
pounds to 700,000 pounds.  A 1925 Bugatti Type 35B Grand Prix two-seater, formerly
owned by past Bugatti Owners’ Club director Jack Perkins, sold
to a phone buyer for 430,500 pounds, against an estimate of
400,000 pounds to 500,000 pounds.  Bonhams’s auction, featuring 99 classic vehicles, raised
7.2 million pounds with fees, a record for its Goodwood sales,
with 85 percent of lots finding buyers. The event had been
expected to raise 6.9 million pounds to 8.6 million pounds. The
equivalent event last year made 3.6 million pounds from 93 cars.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
