Discover Financial Services (DFS) , the
credit-card issuer and payments network, said the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. is reviewing its marketing practices in
relation to its fee-based products.  The FDIC review includes its “payment protection fee
product, which could lead to an enforcement action,” the
Riverwoods, Illinois-based company said in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
