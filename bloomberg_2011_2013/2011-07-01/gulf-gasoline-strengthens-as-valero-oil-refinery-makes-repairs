Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
against futures after  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  reported flaring at
its refinery in  Corpus Christi , Texas, because of maintenance on
an off-gas compressor.  Unit rates were reduced and streams routed to control
devices during the incident yesterday, according to a  filing 
with the National Response Center.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.62 cent to 11.38 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 11:26
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
fell 2.51 cents to $2.8241 a gallon.  “There was no material impact to production associated
with the emissions report at Corpus Christi,” Bill Day, a
Valero spokesman based in  San Antonio , said in an e-mailed
response to questions.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf
increased 0.08 cent to 3.88 cents a gallon.  Pasadena  Refining System Inc., a unit of Petroleo
Brasileiro SA, was starting units that shut down after a power
outage at its plant in Pasadena, Texas, the company said in a
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
