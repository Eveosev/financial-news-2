Japan  land prices declined 3.1
percent in 2010, falling for a second year, before the March
earthquake, the  National Tax Agency  said in a report.  The nationwide  average  prices were measured as of Jan. 1,
2011 and compares with a 4.4 percent decline in the previous
year, the agency said in a report today. The land values
determined by the tax agency are used as an annual guideline to
calculate inheritance tax and for other taxation purposes.  Only a comparison to 2009 figures was given because the
method of valuation was changed last year and the agency will
announce ways to evaluate land prices in seven quake-affected
prefectures including Fukushima and Miyagi as early as October,
the report said. Land values declined at more than two-thirds of
the countryâ€™s land sites after the magnitude-9 earthquake and
tsunami slowed a recovery in the  property market , a quarterly
land ministry  survey  showed in May.  The most expensive land in Japan last year remained the
fifth block of Ginza, a central shopping district in Tokyo,
where prices fell 5.2 percent to 22 million yen ($271,504) per
square meter from a year ago. The prices at the site have
declined 31 percent from three years ago. One square meter
equals 10.76 square feet.  Land prices for the same spot evaluated by the tax agency
tend to be about 20 percent lower than estimates provided by the
land ministry to avoid over-taxation, according to the agency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
