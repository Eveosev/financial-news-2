northwest  Europe . Gasoil for July delivery on London’s ICE
Futures Europe exchange declined. Gasoline’s crack, or premium
to  Brent crude , narrowed. Chevron Corp. started a gasoline unit
at its Pembroke refinery in Wales.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded from $981 to $999 a metric ton,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with yesterday’s deals at
$988 to $997.  Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron were the main
sellers. BP Plc and Gunvor International BV were among the
buyers. The trades are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is
added to make finished automotive fuel, and are typically for
lots of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s crack narrowed to $7.13 a barrel from $7.25
yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., an oil and
refined products broker in  London .  Naphtha’s discount to Brent narrowed to $7.54 a barrel from
$8.04 yesterday, according to PVM data.  Shell said it started cracker 2A today at Wesseling in
 Germany  following maintenance. “The start-up process should be
completed over the weekend,” Kim Blomley, a company spokesman,
said in an e-mail.  Middle Distillates  Jet fuel barges traded at a premium of $91 a ton to July
gasoil, according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring
the Platts pricing window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.

July gasoil, according to the survey. That compares with deals
yesterday at $29 to $31 more than the gasoil contract.  Gasoil for July dropped 1.8 percent to $910.25 a ton as of
4:41 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. Brent for August
delivery fell 2 percent to $110.26 a barrel.  The fuel’s crack shrank to $12.38 a barrel at 4:30 p.m.
London time compared with $12.49 yesterday, ICE data shows.  Barges of the heating fuel traded from flat to a discount
of $1.50 a ton to July gasoil, the survey showed.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil barges traded from $615 to $620.50 a
ton, the survey of Platts showed. That’s lower than yesterday’s
trades from $623 to $626.  Low-sulfur grade traded at $673.50 a ton, the survey
showed. That compares with yesterday’s deals at $681 to $682.50.  Refinery News  Chevron started a fluid catalytic cracker at the 220,000
barrel-a-day Pembroke refinery following a halt last week.  “Following a controlled shutdown of the FCCU at our
refinery in Pembroke last week, Chevron can confirm that the
unit is now back online,” Ruth Kent, a company spokeswoman,
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Repsol YPF SA’s Petronor refinery said it’s beginning to
restart some units, according to a statement on the plant’s
website. Various units were stopped earlier because of
“operating causes,” Petronor said, without providing further
details. The 220,000-barrel-a-day refinery is located near
Bilbao in northern  Spain .  To contact the reporter on this story:
