Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Vice Chairman
Charles Munger said the company, led by  Warren Buffett , will
probably have to pay a dividend in the future because it will
run out of ways to invest its profits.  “I think that some of you will live to see a Berkshire
dividend, but I hope I don’t,” Munger, 87, said today at a
meeting in Pasadena,  California .  Buffett has shunned payouts and share buybacks, preferring
to use the firm’s profits to make acquisitions and buy
securities. With a cash hoard of about $40 billion, it may be
harder to effectively invest the proceeds, Buffett told
investors at a separate meeting in April in Omaha, Nebraska.  “I guess someday we’ll pay a dividend,” Munger said
today, in response to a question from a member of the audience.
“You’re saying, ‘Do you predict failure?’ And I suppose I do.”  Munger is hosting a “Morning With Charlie” today to
replace the annual shareholder meeting of Wesco Financial Corp.,
the Berkshire unit that he ran as chief executive officer. Wesco
is no longer publicly traded after Berkshire acquired its
remaining stock last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
