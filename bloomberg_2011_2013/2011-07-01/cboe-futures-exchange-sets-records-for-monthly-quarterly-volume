The CBOE Futures Exchange LLC
exceeded 1.2 million contracts in June, a monthly record,
helping make the second quarter of 2011 its most-active ever.  The marketplace, which is a unit of CBOE Holdings Inc.,
reported a 368 percent increase in June trading volume from a
year earlier. Trades exceeded 1 million in a month for only the
second time in its history, CBOE said in a statement today.  The monthâ€™s average daily volume at the Chicago-based
exchange grew to 55,600, surpassing the previous record by more
than 8,000 contracts. The exchange had its busiest day ever on
June 16, when 101,200 contracts traded. Trading of futures on
the CBOE Volatility Index, the VIX, totaled more than 1.2
million contracts in June, also a record.  Editor: Stephen Kleege  To contact the reporter on this story:
