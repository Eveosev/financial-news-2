Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s 37.7 million-pound
($60.6 million) acquisition of U.K. price-comparison website
 BeatThatQuote.com  won’t be subjected to a full-blown antitrust
review, the U.K. Office of Fair Trading said.  The OFT decided not to refer the deal to the U.K.
Competition Commission for a second-phase probe, the London-
based watchdog said today in statement. The OFT in April said it
would give the acquisition a preliminary review.  To contact the reporter on this story:
