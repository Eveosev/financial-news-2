Dominique Strauss-Kahn  won a reprieve
with his release yesterday after Manhattan prosecutors found
evidence undermining his accuser’s credibility. It may not be
enough to put him in the 2012 French presidential race.  “His image has been too damaged,” said  Laurent Dubois , a
professor at the Paris Political Studies Institute. “There just
wouldn’t be enough time for the necessary detoxification. There
will always be a shadow over him.”  The former International Monetary Fund chief, accused of
the sexual assault and attempted rape of a hotel maid in  New
York  on May 14, was released yesterday on his recognizance and
will have his bail returned but not his passport, New York State
Supreme Court Justice Michael Obus said. The case against him
wasn’t dismissed and his next court hearing is scheduled for
July 18. Strauss-Kahn has pleaded not guilty.  His Socialist Party is selecting its candidate for next
year’s presidential vote through an open primary in October, the
first time a French political party will choose its candidate
this way. Contenders have until July 13 to register, with the
winner challenging President  Nicolas Sarkozy  next May.  Francois Hollande , a Socialist candidate, said he’s open to postponing
the party’s leadership race to allow Strauss-Kahn to run.  Although Strauss-Kahn’s release gave his supporters hope
for his possible return to French politics, few are willing to
say he will be in the race.  ‘In a Washing Machine’  “It’s better for him now,” Claude Bartolone, a Socialist
Party lawmaker, said on i-tele television yesterday, referring
to his release. Asked if he’ll make the race, Bartolone said,
“DSK has other things on his mind. He’s spinning in a washing
machine, and you’re asking if he’s coming to Paris to run in the
primaries. If he’s found innocent, I’m sure he can once again
play a role in French politics.”  The charges against Strauss-Kahn in the U.S. led to reports
of other unwelcome advances he’d made and extra-marital liaisons
he’d had. It also resulted in soul-searching in  France  about the
attitude of powerful men to women. An under-secretary on
Sarkozy’s cabinet resigned in May after being accused of sexual
assault by at least two colleagues.  “The French are very forgiving of personal matters, but
even they have a certain sense of what they want a president’s
personality to be, and this doesn’t fit it,” said Bruno Jeanbart, director of political studies at polling company
Opinionway. “These sorts of stories are very difficult to make
go away.”  $50,000 Townhouse  In addition, Strauss-Kahn’s stay in a $50,000-a-month
townhouse while on bail revealed the wealth of his American-born
wife  Anne Sinclair . With her help, he posted a $1 million cash
bail and a $5 million bond, which will now be returned.  “The money he was able to spend is not exactly the sort of
publicity you want as you run for the Socialist Party’s
candidacy,” Dubois said. Sinclair, who stood by her husband, is
the grand-daughter of one of France’s leading art dealers.  Strauss-Kahn was at onetime the leading Socialist candidate
for the 2012 French presidential elections. Before his arrest,
polls showed Strauss-Kahn as the Socialist candidate best placed
to defeat Sarkozy. Two party leaders,  Martine Aubry  and
Hollande, announced their candidacies after his arrest and
emerged as the front runners.  Since his May 14 arrest, many Strauss-Kahn allies have
declared their own candidacy or endorsed other candidates.  “The Socialist Party has already turned the page,”
Frederic Dabi, director of public opinion at polling company
Ifop said in a telephone interview. “Many of DSK’s lieutenants
have joined other campaigns.”  A ‘Major’ Role  Party leaders yesterday mostly limited their comments to
messages of personal support for Strauss-Kahn.  Aubry said she was “speaking as a friend of DSK” in
saying that she hoped that “the American justice system will
establish the truth and allow Dominique to exit this
nightmare.” She declined to answer a question about the
schedule of the primaries in her comments to TV crews in the
northern town of Lille, where she is mayor.  Segolene Royal, who beat Strauss-Kahn to become the
Socialist candidate in 2007 and then lost to Sarkozy, said on
Europe1 radio that “everyone should be careful not to exploit
this moment.”  Socialist Party spokesman Benoit Hamon said today on
France’s parliamentary television channel that suspending or
delaying the primary “is not currently on the agenda.”  Asked about Strauss-Kahn possibly being a candidate in the
party’s primary, he replied: “We can’t go faster than the music.
We have all heard lots of things, but until they are confirmed
by the U.S. justice system this all remains just conjecture.”  Sarkozy spokesman Franck Louvrier yesterday said he had no
comment.  Strauss-Kahn’s political allies were more outspoken. “If
he’s freed, Dominique should be called on to play a major
political role in France,”  Jack Lang , a former culture
minister, yesterday said on BFM television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
