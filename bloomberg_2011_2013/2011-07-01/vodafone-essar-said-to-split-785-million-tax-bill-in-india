Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and Essar Group
Ltd. are working on an agreement to split a tax bill following 
the U.K. company’s purchase of Essar’s stake in their Indian 
unit, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The companies are working on the structure of a deal after
Vodafone withdrew a tax-dispute case over the holding, the
people said, declining to be identified as the matter is
confidential.  India ’s tax tribunal expects to receive about 35
billion rupees ($785 million), it said today.  Vodafone, the world’s largest mobile-phone company, agreed
in May to buy Essar’s stake after the partner exercised an
option to sell its holding in the venture for $5 billion. An
agreement on the outstanding tax would increase the amount which
Vodafone will pay for Essar’s stake.  The transaction will raise Newbury, England-based
Vodafone’s stake to 75 percent. The tax is on Vodafone’s $3.8
billion purchase of a 22 percent stake in Vodafone Essar Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
