(Corrects month in first paragraph.)  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) ,  India ’s
biggest automaker, fell the most in a week in Mumbai trading
after sales declined for the first time since December 2008 as a
strike curbed production.  The New Delhi-based carmaker’s shares fell as much as 2.6
percent, the biggest intraday decline since June 23, and traded
1.8 percent lower at 1,139 rupees as of 11:28 a.m. The benchmark
Sensitive Index was little changed.  Maruti sold 80,298 vehicles in June, compared with 88,091
units a year earlier, according to an e-mailed statement today.
Local sales decreased 3.8 percent to 70,020, while exports fell
33 percent.  Workers ended an 11-day strike at its Manesar plant near
New Delhi on June 17, after the company agreed to take back
dismissed employees. The strike at the factory, which builds as
many as 1,200 cars daily, cost the Indian unit of  Suzuki Motor
Corp. (7269)  $9 million a day, Chairman R.C. Bhargava said on June 8.  The company said in June it may miss its forecast of as
much as 15 percent sales growth in the year that started April
1, as higher  interest rates  and rising fuel costs hurt demand.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has raised interest rates 10
times since the start of 2010 to rein in inflation, driving down
demand for cars in a country where 80 percent of all purchases
are funded by loans.  State-owned refiner Indian Oil Corp., the country’s
largest, raised the price of gasoline by 5 rupees a liter to
63.37 rupees ($1.4) in  New Delhi  in May. That is the biggest
increase since June 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
