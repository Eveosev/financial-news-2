South African gold production climbed
3.4 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, the
Chamber of Mines of  South Africa  said.  Output was 44,682.7 kilograms (1.4 million ounces), down
9.3 percent from the fourth quarter, the industry group said in
an e-mailed statement today.  South Africa’s estimated gold output for last year was
revised lower by 0.2 percent to 191,402.3 kilograms because of a
change in “other Chamber” figures, it said in the statement.
The country was the fifth largest producer last year, after
 China , Australia, the U.S. and Russia, London-based research
company GFMS said in a report in April.  The chamber represents producers including  AngloGold
Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  and Harmony Gold Mining Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
