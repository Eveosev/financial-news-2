Georgian lawmakers gave final
approval to a bill to impose restrictions on public protests
after two people were killed at an anti-government rally in May,
easing some curbs from an earlier version.  The bill restricts rallies from encroaching on buildings
such as airports, prevents small protests from obstructing
streets and prohibits demonstrators from possessing dangerous
objects or consuming alcohol, parliament member  Chiora
Taktakishvili  said by phone in Tbilisi today.  The final version of the bill gives protesters the right to
demonstrate around some government buildings and block streets
if they receive prior permission, relaxing restrictions from the
first reading, said Taktakishvili, first deputy chairman of the
Parliamentary Committee on Legal Issues.  President Mikheil Saakashvili, who came to power after the
so-called Rose Revolution in 2003, has repeatedly faced
challenges from former allies calling for his resignation. The
new regulations follow a May 26 rally in Tbilisi where a
demonstrator and a police officer were killed and at least 19
people were injured.  The bill needs to be signed by Saakashvili to take effect.  Separately, lawmakers approved the relocation of the
parliament to the Caucasus nationâ€™s second-largest city of
Kutaisi from 2012, Taktakishvili said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
