Three Harvard Medical School child
psychiatrists violated conflict of interest policies and have
been restricted in their interactions with industry for at least
three years.  The three Harvard doctors said they will refrain from
outside industry-sponsored activities for a year and undergo
monitoring for an additional two years. The doctors, Joseph Biederman, Thomas Spencer and Timothy Wilens, disclosed the
restrictions in a letter to colleagues that was released by e-
mail by  Massachusetts General Hospital  in  Boston .  To contact the reporter on this story:
