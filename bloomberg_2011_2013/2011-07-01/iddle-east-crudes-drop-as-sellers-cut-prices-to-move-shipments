Middle East crude oils for sale to
 Asia  slumped against their benchmarks as sellers reduced prices
to move cargoes as the trading period ends.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s Murban for August loading
dropped 18 cents to a discount of 58 cents a barrel to its
official selling price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the biggest gap since August 2009. Qatar Land dropped 8
cents to 68 cents below its official level, Bloomberg data
showed.  Extra cargoes remain in the market as refiners reach the
end of the monthly purchase period for August supplies. Sellers
are slashing prices on concern of excess shipments after  Saudi
Arabia  last month sold additional July-loading oil and the
 International Energy Agency  released strategic stockpiles.  Oman futures for September delivery fell $1.09 to $106.40 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 7:01 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,243 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$106.18 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  Oman crude for immediate loading declined 33 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $106.22 barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil for
delivery in August slumped 0.4 percent to $105.96. Murban
decreased 0.5 percent to $110.35.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker against the Persian Gulf grade, narrowed 14
cents to $5.11 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., an oil and refined-products broker in  London .
The exchange for swaps for September rose 9 cents to $4.87.  To contact the reporter on this story:
