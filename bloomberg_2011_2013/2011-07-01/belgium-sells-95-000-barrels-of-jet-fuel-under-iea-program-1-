The Belgian government sold its
allocation of  jet fuel  under an International Energy Agency
program and approved the sale of other fuels held by industry.  About 15 million liters, or 95,000 barrels, of jet fuel
were sold in a tender this week and will be delivered to the
buyer in July, the official from Apetra, the government agency
that holds oil stockpiles, said from Brussels, declining to be
identified in line with government policy.  The IEA, adviser to countries including the U.S. and the
U.K., is coordinating the release of 60 million barrels of crude
and oil products to markets from this week.  Belgium , one of 12
nations participating, is the only country to release oil from
stockpiles held by government and industry.  Belgiumâ€™s Energy Ministry approved the release of industry
stocks on June 29, according to a government document obtained
by Bloomberg. Industry stocks available under the program
include 87,664 tons of distillate fuels, 5,066 tons of gasoline,
and 850 tons of  fuel oil , the document says.  The distillates fuels category includes diesel, heating oil
and jet fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
