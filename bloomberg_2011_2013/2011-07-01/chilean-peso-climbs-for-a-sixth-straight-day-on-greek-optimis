Chile ’s peso strengthened for a sixth
straight day, its longest winning streak in 2011, on rising
copper prices and signs that Greece will avoid a default,
leading to increased demand for riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 465.28 per U.S. dollar at
3:50 p.m. New York time, from 467.22 yesterday. The currency
increased 1.9 percent for the week. It rose during seven
consecutive days in the period ended Dec. 9.  “ Risk aversion , in general, has been declining over the
last several days on the back of the improvements in the
negotiations on the Greece front,” Roberto Melzi, a Latin
America strategist at  Barclays Capital  in New York, said in a
telephone interview. “That’s the key driver that is pushing
riskier assets to stronger levels.”  Greece  may receive as much as 85 billion euros ($124
billion) in new financing, including a contribution from private
investors, in a second bailout aimed at preventing default and
ending the euro-region’s debt crisis, according to an Austrian
Finance Ministry official.  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, gained
as much as 0.7 percent today in New York, reaching its highest
price since April 26.  Chile’s central bank paid an average of 465.91 pesos per
U.S. dollar for $50 million as part of a $12 billion effort to
limit the peso’s gains, according to data posted on the bank’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
