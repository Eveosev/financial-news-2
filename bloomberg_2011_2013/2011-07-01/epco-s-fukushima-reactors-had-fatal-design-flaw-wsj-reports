Half of Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s 10
reactors in Fukushima prefecture were hobbled by a design flaw
that contributed to the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl,
the Wall Street Journal said, citing interviews with former
engineers who worked at the utility.  Tepco, as the company is known, located vital switching
stations, the size of a kitchen table, in poorly protected
buildings in five out of six reactors at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi
plant, the newspaper reported. Tepco’s four other reactors in
Fukushima are at its Dai-Ni plant.  When the buildings were swamped by the tsunami, the
switching stations stopped working, meaning power supplied by
some back-up generators couldn’t get to the cooling systems,
causing four of the reactors at Dai-Ichi to overheat and leak
radiation, the report said.  The design flaw in the oldest reactors at Fukushima, which
was known about by some Tepco engineers, wasn’t rectified even
though there were numerous safety upgrades at the plant, the
paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
