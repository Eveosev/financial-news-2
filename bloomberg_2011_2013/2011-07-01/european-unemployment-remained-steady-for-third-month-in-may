European unemployment remained steady
for a third month in May as governments struggled to contain the
region’s debt crisis and the recovery showed signs of cooling.  The 17-nation euro region’s seasonally adjusted jobless
rate held at 9.9 percent, the European Union statistics office
in Luxembourg said in an e-mailed statement today. That’s in
line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 33
economists. At 20.9 percent,  Spain  had the highest jobless rate
and the Netherlands the lowest at 4.2 percent.  European companies may remain reluctant to boost hiring as
governments step up austerity measures just as the recovery
falters. Manufacturing growth slowed in June and European
economic confidence weakened. While debt-burdened  Greece  and
 Portugal  are among euro-region nations struggling to emerge from
a recession, German unemployment dropped for a 24th month in
June and Munich-based Siemens AG,  Europe ’s largest engineering
company, said on June 28 it’s unable to find enough workers.  About 15.5 million people were unemployed in the euro area
in May, up 16,000 from the previous month, today’s report
showed. In the 27-nation EU, unemployment held at 9.3 percent.  In  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, unemployment fell to
6 percent in May from 6.1 percent in the previous month, while
 France ’s jobless rate dropped to 9.5 percent from 9.6 percent.  In the U.S., unemployment was at 9.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
