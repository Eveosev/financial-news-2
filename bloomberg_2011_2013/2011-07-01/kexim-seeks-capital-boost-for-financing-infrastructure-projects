Export-Import Bank of Korea said the
government needs to double its capital to 15 trillion won ($14
billion) to boost its ability to finance infrastructure and
resources-development projects.  The state-run lender known as Kexim aims to more than
double the loans and guarantees it extends for overseas projects
to 150 trillion won by 2020 from 66 trillion won this year,
according to an e-mailed statement today. Seoul-based Kexim said
it plans to increase financing for energy and resources projects
to half of its 2020 portfolio.  Korea would need to amend laws to raise Keximâ€™s capital
from the current 8 trillion won, according to the lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
