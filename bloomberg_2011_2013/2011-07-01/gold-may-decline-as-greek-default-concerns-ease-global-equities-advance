Gold futures tumbled to a six-week
low as  Greece  progressed in staving off a default, curbing
demand for the metal as an investment haven.  Greece may get as much as 85 billion euros ($124 billion)
in new financing, including a contribution from private
investors, in a second bailout aimed at preventing default and
ending the euro region’s debt crisis, according to an Austrian
Finance Ministry official. Gold dropped 2.2 percent last month.  “There could be scope for further pressure in the short
term,”  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in  London ,
said in a report. An accord on austerity measures in Greece is
“likely to trigger an increase in risk appetite. In addition,
gold is entering what is traditionally a slow period for
physical demand,” he said.  Gold futures for August delivery fell $20.20, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $1,482.60 an ounce at 1:57 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . Earlier, the price touched $1,478.30, the
lowest for a most-active contract since May 17. The price
dropped 1.2 percent this week.  The dollar headed for a weekly decline against a basket of
major currencies, snapping a three-week rally.  “Gold’s inability to extend further gains in recent
sessions, despite a weaker dollar, could be a warning sign
heading into the third quarter,”  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  said in a report.  Silver futures for September delivery fell $1.127, or 3.2
percent, to $33.705 an ounce. The price dropped 2.7 percent this
week.  Palladium for September delivery slipped $3.20, or 0.4
percent, to $757.45 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The metal rose 3.5 percent this week.  Platinum for October delivery dropped $9.30, or 0.5
percent, to $1,716.80 an ounce. The price gained 2.2 percent
this week.  To contact the reporter for this story:
