Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei.  The Taiex Index rose 87.23 points, or 1 percent, to
8,739.82, rounding off a third day of gains. The gauge climbed
2.4 percent this week, halting three consecutive weekly losses.  Foxconn Technology Co. (2354 TT) surged 6.7 percent to
NT$127, the biggest advance since April 18, on speculation the
stock had dropped “too much” after a decline in the company’s
May sales, said Tom Tang, an assistant vice-president at
Masterlink Investment Advisory. The shares fell 14 percent from
June 10, when it said sales sank 53 percent, to June 30.  “As an Apple Inc. iPad supplier, foreign investors still
have faith in the stock,” Tang said in a telephone interview in
Taipei. “It fell too much previously on May sales but investors
expect the second half of the year to be more optimistic for the
company.”  Micro-Star International Co. (2377 TT) increased 2.5
percent to NT$14.25, the steepest advance since May 31. Micro-
Star’s board approved plans to buy back 40 million shares, or
3.73 percent of outstanding stock, the Taipei-based company said
in an exchange filing yesterday.  ProMOS Technologies Inc. (5387)  (5387 TT) extended gains for a
second day, rising 5.6 percent to NT$0.75. The memory chipmaker
said it asked banks to lower the interest rate on its loans to
0.1 percent and to delay payment of the balance. ProMOS paid
interest of NT$4.48 million ($156,190) on June 30, when it was
originally slated to pay NT$114.8 million, it said in an
exchange filing today. The stock surged 6 percent yesterday
after the Commercial Times reported the loan rate cut.  To contact the reporter on this story:
