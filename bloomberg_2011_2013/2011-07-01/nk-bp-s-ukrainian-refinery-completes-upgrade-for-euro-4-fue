TNK-BP said its Linik refinery in
Ukraine completed an upgrade to produce Euro-4 car fuels and
will begin deliveries to its domestic filling stations in the
coming days.  The plant modernized its hydrogen refining process for
 diesel fuel  and made other improvements for transfer to the
Euro-4 standard, Didier Casimiro, head of TNK-BP’s operations in
Ukraine, said today in an e-mailed statement from the company.  Linik aims to produce fuels of Euro-5 level as soon as next
year and will need to upgrade hydrogen and sulfur production
facilities, according to the statement.  Euro-4 standard fuels contains no more than 50 parts per
million of sulfur. Euro-5, with a 10 parts-per-million limit, is
the strictest European Union fuel category. A lower sulfur
content reduces pollution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
