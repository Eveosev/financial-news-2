Copper in  London  dropped for the
first time in four days, paring a weekly increase, as some
investors sold the metal to lock in gains after the metal
climbed to a two-month high yesterday. Zinc and lead also
declined.  Three-month delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
fell as much as 0.6 percent to $9,375 a metric ton, and last
traded at $9,383 by 8:04 a.m. Singapore time. The metal, which
reached $9,430.15 a ton yesterday, is 3.7 percent higher this
week, set for its best week in 12.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
