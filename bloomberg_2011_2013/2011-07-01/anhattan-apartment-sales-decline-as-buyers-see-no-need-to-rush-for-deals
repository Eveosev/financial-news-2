Manhattan apartment sales and prices
fell in the second quarter from a year earlier, as the absence
of a federal tax credit created less urgency to complete deals.  Purchases of condominiums and co-ops declined 3.8 percent
from a year earlier to 2,650, New York appraiser  Miller Samuel
Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman  Real Estate said in a
report today. The median price of co-ops and condos that changed
hands in the borough dropped 5.5 percent to $850,000.  In 2010, buyers in contract rushed to close deals before an
initial June 30 expiration of a government tax credit of as much
as $8,000. That deadline “artificially inflated” sales volume
and values for the second quarter,  Jonathan Miller , president of
New York-based Miller Samuel, said in a telephone interview. For
the three months ended yesterday, the number of purchases and
property values were about the same as they might have been a
year earlier without the incentive, he said.  “People don’t feel as though prices are going down, but
there’s not this overwhelming feeling that prices are increasing
by the day,” said  Pamela Liebman , chief executive officer of
the Corcoran Group brokerage, which also released a report on
the Manhattan sales market today. “People feel that they can
wait a little bit to find what they want.”  New York City ’s jobless rate was at a 25-month low of 8.6
percent in May, unchanged from the previous month and down 1
percent from a year earlier, the state Department of Labor said
on June 16. The city’s financial industry showed a net gain of
10,400 jobs in the 12 months through May.  Days on the Market  Manhattan properties stayed on the market an average of 136
days, or 30 percent longer than a year earlier, according to
 Miller Samuel  and Prudential. Listing discounts, which measure
the amount of money sellers subtracted from their last asking
price to strike a deal, fell to 3.5 percent from 9.1 percent.  “I would describe it as stable,” Miller said. “It’s not
booming, it’s just solid.”  Luxury apartments saw an increase in values, with the
median price climbing 11 percent to $4.55 million from a year
earlier, according to Miller Samuel and Prudential. Buyers of
luxury units, defined as the top 10 percent of all sales by
price, opted for apartments that were 4.6 percent larger,
averaging 2,935 square feet (273 square meters).  For apartments in new developments, the median sales price
fell 19 percent to $1.13 million and the number of purchases
declined 7.2 percent to 577, Miller Samuel and Prudential said.
Units in new developments made up about 20 percent of all sales
in the quarter, up from an almost seven-year low in the first
three months of the year, when their market share was 15
percent.  Corcoran, StreetEasy  Five reports issued today on the Manhattan apartment market
showed mixed results for sales and values in the second quarter.
 Corcoran Group  said purchases of condos and co-ops declined 14
percent from a year earlier to 3,180. The median price of units
that changed hands climbed 6 percent to $830,000.  StreetEasy.com , a service that compiles broker listings,
said the median price increased 7.8 percent to $810,000, while
completed deals fell 12 percent. Brokerage  Brown Harris Stevens 
and its sister firm,  Halstead Property LLC , reported a median
price of $835,000, a 1 percent drop from 2010.  “My opinion of prices throughout the market is they’re not
going up and they’re not going down,” said Hall Willkie,
president of New York-based Brown Harris Stevens. “Buyers are
buying but they are very price-sensitive. The confidence that
real estate is going to be worth more tomorrow is not that
common. It’s very possible that in the immediate future prices
will remain flat.”  ‘Even Playing Field’  For Lindsay Luppino and her parents, this spring was as
good as any time to make a purchase.  “They wanted to buy because the market is on its way back
up,” said Luppino, 29, a musical-theater performer whose
parents bought her a one-bedroom co-op in April.  Luppino looked at 20 apartments before deciding on a third-
floor unit on  West 56th Street , which she’ll share with her
brother. The apartment, with exposed brick and an open kitchen,
was on the market for 103 days and sold for $468,000 -- a cut of
6.2 percent from its original asking price, according to
StreetEasy.  “I think it’s more of an even playing field now,”
Luppino, a former property broker, said of the Manhattan sales
market. “I did real estate in 2005-2006, in the heyday. Back
then it wasn’t even fair for buyers.”  Peak to Trough  Average resale values of Manhattan apartments fell 31
percent from their peak of $975,000 in the second quarter of
2008 to the trough of $675,000 in the first three months of
2009, according to Miller. The figures don’t include sales at
new developments. Since then, there have been no dramatic price
swings, Miller said.  Sarah and Greg Bengzon of Herndon,  Virginia , said the
stability of the Manhattan market compared with the rest of the
country made it a good place for a second home. The couple,
seeking to diversify their investments, sealed the deal on June
23 for a one-bedroom,  prewar co-op  on the Upper West Side. Their
purchase price was $435,000.  “We have a lot of investments in stocks at the moment, so
we thought it’d be good to invest where it’s low,” said Sarah
Bengzon, 42, a quality director for technology consulting
company  Accenture Plc. (ACN)  “The rates were great, the housing
prices were great. We’d been looking a while for where we could
put our money.”  One, Two Bedrooms  Two-bedroom apartments comprised 38 percent of all
properties that sold in the quarter, according to Miller Samuel
and Prudential. The median price rose 5 percent to $1.31 million
from a year earlier. One-bedrooms accounted for 36 percent of
sales, with the median price dropping 1.8 percent to $627,500.  The median price of three-bedrooms climbed 20 percent to
$3.1 million, while apartments with four or more bedrooms
climbed 18 percent to $5.5 million.  On the Upper East Side, the median price of existing co-ops
climbed 3 percent to $840,000 from a year earlier, according to
Corcoran. Condo prices in the neighborhood rose 12 percent to
1.2 million. On the Upper West Side, the median price of co-op
resales climbed 7 percent to $772,000, while condo resale prices
fell 14 percent to $898,000.  To contact the reporters on this story:
