(Corrects stake in first paragraph.)  Greece  plans to sell units belonging
to  Public Power  Crop SA instead of a 17 percent stake as it will
fetch more revenue at market prices,  Kathimerini  reported.  Two companies to hold lignite, hydro and possibly natural
gas powered plants will be set up and sold to third parties, the
Athens-based newspaper reported, without citing anyone.  The two companies will hold 3,000 megawatts, or 25 percent,
of Public Powerâ€™s total installed capacity, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
