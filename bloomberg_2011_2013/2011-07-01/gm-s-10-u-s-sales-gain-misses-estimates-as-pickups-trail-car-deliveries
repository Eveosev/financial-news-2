U.S. auto sales in June ran at the
slowest pace in 12 months, as small-car supply dwindled,  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) ’s inventory thinned and consumers deferred purchases
amid a slowing economic recovery.  General Motors Co. (GM)  and  Ford Motor Co. (F)  said U.S. sales rose
10 percent in June, missing the average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Toyota and Honda Motor Co.
deliveries each fell 21 percent, more than analysts estimated.
Nissan Motor Co. recorded an 11 percent gain, less than
projected, while Chrysler Group LLC sales topped forecasts.  Industrywide light-vehicle sales slowed to an 11.5 million
seasonally adjusted annual rate, trailing the 12 million average
estimate of 12 analysts. Small-car purchases are being lost due
to supply constraints hurting all automakers.  “What we thought was going to be a stable recovery was
shattered by the Japanese problems in the first half,”  Jesse Toprak , an analyst at TrueCar.com, said in a telephone
interview. “These are fragile blocks we’re stepping on to get
to more stable ground.”  Total light-vehicle sales rose 7.1 percent in June from a
year earlier to 1.05 million, researcher Autodata Corp. said in
an e-mailed statement. Japan’s March 11 earthquake, which cut
production and vehicle inventories for Toyota and Honda, again
contributed to a slower growth pace.  GM, Ford and Chrysler had combined market share of 50.1
percent last month, the first time the U.S.-based companies rose
above 50 percent since August 2009, according to Autodata. Sales
declines for Toyota and Honda cut market share for Asia-based
carmakers’ to 39.9 percent from 44.8 percent a year ago,
according to  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based Autodata.  Buyers ‘Sitting Out’  Deliveries of Chevrolet Silverado and Ford F-Series pickups
rose less than those of fuel-efficient models such as the Cruze
and Focus after gasoline above $3.50 a gallon led to shortages
of cars like GM’s Aveo and Ford’s Fiesta. Toyota had only about
a 1-day supply of Prius hybrids as of last week, said  Bob Carter , group vice president of Toyota’s U.S. sales.  “A lot of full-size pickup buyers in particular, when
there was volatility and uncertainty around fuel prices, were
sitting out of the market,”  Don Johnson , GM’s vice president of
U.S. sales, said yesterday on a conference call. “We expect
them to come back into the market as the economy slowly
recovers.”  The  unemployment rate  rose to 9.1 percent in May. U.S.
consumers’ confidence fell more than anticipated in June, the
Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index showed
yesterday. The percentage of consumers planning to buy a new
vehicle within six months fell to 3.1 percent, the lowest since
December, the New York-based Conference Board said this week.  U.S. auto sales will recover in the second half and annual
deliveries will rise to 12.9 million vehicles, according to
forecasters at Edmunds.com and J.D. Power & Associates.  Prius Stumbles  Toyota and Honda, having lost production after the 9.0-
magnitude earthquake March 11 near  Japan , were expected to
report declines of 13 percent, the average of four analysts’
estimates surveyed by Bloomberg.  Toyota sold 110,937 Toyota, Lexus and Scion vehicles last
month, down from 140,604 a year ago, including just 4,340 Prius
hybrids. That was the lowest volume for the car since September
2004, according to Bloomberg data.  Nissan, Japan’s second-largest automaker, sold 71,941
Nissan and Infiniti brand vehicles last month, up from 64,570 a
year ago, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Nissan’s 11
percent gain compares to a forecast of a 25 percent increase,
the average of four analysts’ estimates.  Honda’s Slide  Honda’s deliveries dipped to 83,892 Honda and Acura
vehicles from 106,627, as production of Civic small cars again
ran at only about a 50 percent rate at North American plants.
The Tokyo-based company doesn’t know yet how soon it can resume
full production, said  Chris Martin , a Honda spokesman.  Some consumers, hearing about tight vehicle supplies for
the Japan-based brands, may have stayed away from dealer lots in
June on concern prices would be higher than usual,  Al Castignetti , Nissan’s vice president of U.S. sales, said in a
phone interview yesterday.  “There may have been some concern about getting gouged on
price,” Castignetti said.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ,  South Korea ’s largest automaker, boosted
sales 16 percent in June to 59,209, while affiliate  Kia Motors
Corp. (000270)  said its U.S. deliveries jumped 41 percent to 45,044. The
companies, which operate separately in the U.S., sold a combined
104,253 cars and light trucks last month, behind only GM, Ford,
Toyota and Chrysler.  ’Dissimilar’ to 2008  The industry’s slowdown since April is “dissimilar to 2008
when people were just sitting out of the market indefinitely,”
said Jessica Caldwell, an Edmunds.com analyst in  Santa Monica ,
 California . “People that are going to buy have made a short-
term delay instead of a long-term delay.”  Lower supply among competitors may result in industrywide
sales this year finishing at the low end of Detroit-based GM’s
forecast for 2011, Johnson said. GM forecasts 2011 sales of 13
million to 13.5 million vehicles, including medium-and heavy-
duty trucks.  Ford reported 193,415 light-vehicle sales, missing
analysts’ average estimate for a 12 percent increase. F-Series
truck sales rose 6.7 percent and Focus deliveries surged 41
percent, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company said in a
statement.  GM’s deliveries in the month rose to 215,358 vehicles from
195,380 a year earlier, according to a statement. The
automaker’s total deliveries were expected to rise 18 percent.
Cruze sales increased to 24,896 for the month, more than double
the year-earlier deliveries of the Cobalt car that it replaces
and the most among all cars in the industry for the month.  Trucks, Small-Car Supply  GM ended June with 122 days’ supply of full-size pickups,
Johnson said yesterday, from 110 days at the end of May. The
automaker is targeting full-size truck inventory of less than
110 days by the end of the year and may reduce output beyond
idling some pickup plants this month, he said.  “We’re not going to overreact, and we’re not going to jump
into the market with unusually aggressive incentives to get rid
of what some may say is a way-too-high inventory,” Johnson said
yesterday. “We can manage it throughout the rest of the year.”  GM rose 22 cents to $30.58 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. Ford rose 23 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $14.02.  Ford’s Forecast  Ford continues to forecast 13 million to 13.5 million
vehicle sales, including medium- and heavy-duty trucks, analyst
 George Pipas  said June 30. Greater availability of models such
as the Focus and Fiesta, which have fallen to 20 days’ supply,
and cars such as Honda’s Civic and Toyota’s Corolla will help
industry sales rebound in the second half, he said.  GM’s Aveo and HHR car models fell to less than 16 days’
supply at the end of June, Johnson said.  The light-vehicle seasonally adjusted annual sales rate
failed to improve from the May rate of 11.8 million, according
to Autodata. The pace in June was the slowest since June 2010.  Chrysler sales rose 30 percent 120,394. The  Auburn Hills ,
Michigan-based automaker’s deliveries of the new 200 sedan were
7,219, and Jeep Grand Cherokee sales more than tripled.  To contact the reporters on this story:
