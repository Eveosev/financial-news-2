BTA Bank,  Kazakhstan ’s biggest lender
before it was nationalized in 2009, said two representatives of
sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, including deputy chief
executive officer Aidan Karibzhanov, resigned from its board.  Karibzhanov and Abai Iskandirov were replaced by Samruk-
Kazyna representatives Murat Baisynov and Alina Aldambergen, the
Almaty-based lender said today in an e-mailed statement. BTA
also said shareholders voted yesterday not to pay a dividend on
2010 earnings and to increase capital reserves by 95.1 billion
tenge ($653 million). Samruk-Kazyna owns 81.5 percent of BTA.  BTA defaulted in April 2009, two months after it was taken
over by Samruk-Kazyna. Temirbank and Alliance Bank also
defaulted and ceded control to the sovereign wealth fund as
credit markets froze and Kazakhstan’s real estate bubble burst
during the global financial crisis.  The board changes come after Timur Kulibayev, a son-in-law
of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, replaced  Kairat Kelimbetov  as head of Samruk-Kazyna in April. Kazakhstan plans
to create a new company to oversee its holdings in the three
lenders, central bank Chairman Grigori Marchenko said April 19.  Alliance Bank said June 15 that Aldambergen replaced
Karibazhanov as chairman. Karibzhanov, who had been a BTA board
member since March 2009, was named deputy CEO of the fund in
May, replacing BTA Bank Chairman Arman Dunayev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
