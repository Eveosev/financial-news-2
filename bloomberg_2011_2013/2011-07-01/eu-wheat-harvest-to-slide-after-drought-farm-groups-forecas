The European Union wheat harvest,
making up a fifth of world production, will slide this year
after drought slashed yields in  France  and the U.K., farm lobby
Copa-Cogeca and cereal-industry group Coceral forecast.  Farmers will reap 129.9 million metric tons of wheat, 3.5
percent below last year’s harvest, Brussels-based Copa-Cogeca
said in an e-mailed statement today, while Coceral forecast
production of the grain will slip 0.8 percent.  France,  Germany  and the U.K, the largest EU wheat growers,
had the driest spring in decades. Soils in France’s northern
half held the least water in 50 years in April, as the drought
prompted water-use restrictions in two-thirds of the country.  “In view of the drought this year which has affected large
parts of the EU, the estimates are still very uncertain,” Ian
Backhouse, chairman of  Copa-Cogeca ’s cereals working group, said
in the statement.  The EU harvested 134.6 million tons of wheat in 2010,
according to the Copa-Cogeca report. The group in March had
forecast a 2.3 percent increase in European wheat output.  Soft-wheat production in the EU is forecast to slide 2.9
percent to 122.2 million tons, while the harvest of durum wheat,
the hard variety used to make pasta and couscous, may fall 12
percent to 7.74 million tons, according to Copa-Cogeca.  Brussels-based Coceral forecasts the EU soft-wheat crop
will slip 0.3 percent to 126.5 million tons and durum production
will decline 7.1 percent to 7.89 million tons.  Barley Harvest  Barley production is forecast to slide 4.4 percent to 50.4
million tons, Copa-Cogeca forecasts. Coceral estimates harvest
of the grain will slip 1.5 percent to 51.76 million tons.  EU corn production will rise 9 percent to 60.2 million
tons, according to Copa-Cogeca, or 3.5 percent to 57.2 million
tons according to Coceral, respectively.  Both lobby organizations forecast a smaller rapeseed crop
as a result of a smaller area and more sunflower seed on
increased planting, respectively.  Copa-Cogeca expects an 8.4 percent decline for rapeseed to
18.1 million tons, contrasting with a 9.1 percent jump for
sunflower seed to 7.34 million tons. Coceral estimates rapeseed
will fall 10 percent to 18.5 million tons and sunflower-seed
output will progress 6.4 percent to 7.52 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
