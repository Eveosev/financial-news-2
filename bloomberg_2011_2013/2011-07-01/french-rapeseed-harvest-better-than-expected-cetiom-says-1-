The rapeseed crop in northern and
eastern  France  is better than expected based on initial
harvesting, according to Cetiom, the country’s technical center
for oilseed crops.  Yields are “very variable” according to soil conditions
and rainfall, ranging from 1 metric ton a hectare (2.47 acres)
to more than 4.5 tons, the Paris-based researcher said in a
 report  on its website today.  “The harvest is better than expected, but uneven,” Cetiom
said. “Broadly speaking, the performance is above initial
expectations, which confirms that dry years are not unfavorable
for rapeseed.”  France had its second-hottest April since 1900, and soils
in the country’s northern half were the driest in 50 years at
the end of that month, according to the government. National
rapeseed output is forecast to fall 8.3 percent to 4.4 million
tons in the 2011-12 crop year as average yields slide to 2.9
tons a hectare from 3.3 tons, farm lobby Copa-Cogeca said in a
report today.  Northern and eastern France account for about 60 percent of
the country’s rapeseed production.  In the Champagne-Ardenne and Seine-et-Marne regions east of
Paris, average yields are around 4 tons a hectare so far,
according to Cetiom. In the Saone-et-Loire region southeast of
the French capital, where more than half of the rapeseed has
been cut, the average yield is around 3.5 tons, the oilseed
center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
