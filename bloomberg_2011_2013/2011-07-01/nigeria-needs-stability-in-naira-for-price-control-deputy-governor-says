Nigeria,  Africa ’s biggest oil
producer, needs a stable currency to keep inflation under
control, central bank Deputy Governor Kingsley Moghalu said.  “If we lose stability of the  exchange rate , then we’ve
lost everything,” Moghalu told central bankers in  South
Africa ’s capital, Pretoria, today.  The central bank has sold dollars, cutting into foreign
currency reserves, to keep the naira within a range of 3 percent
above or below 150 per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions. Its
goal is to reduce the inflation rate, which reached 12.4 percent
in May, to below 10 percent.  “We do expect a slight appreciation of the naira’s value
before the end of the year” after restrictions on foreign
investors’ debt holdings were lifted, Moghalu said.  The naira jumped to a more than six-month high of 150.125
against the dollar in interbank trading in Lagos after the
change came into effect today.  The bank also wants a “normalization” of  interest rates ,
Moghalu said. It raised the benchmark rate for a third time this
year in May, pushing it to 8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
