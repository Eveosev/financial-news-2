French entrepreneur Vincent  Bollore (BOL) â€™s
electric-car rental service for Paris will start operations in
December,  Le Parisien  reported, citing an interview with the
financier.  Bollore SA will initially open 250 stations, eventually
growing to 580, according to the interview. Bollore Energie is
investing 50 million euros ($72 million) to build batteries for
the cars at a factory in Brittany.  Bollore told Parisien he expects 100,000 people to sign up
for the service, which is based on the short-term bike rental
system in Paris. About 4,000 cars will be available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
