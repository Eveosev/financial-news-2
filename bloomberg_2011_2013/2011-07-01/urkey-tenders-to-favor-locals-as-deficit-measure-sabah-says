Turkish state tenders will be
required to give preference to locally made goods and services,
 Sabah  newspaper reported, citing Foreign Trade Minister Zafer Caglayan.  The measure is being introduced as part of efforts to
reduce  Turkey â€™s current-account deficit, the Istanbul-based
newspaper cited Caglayan as saying. Turkish goods and services
will be preferred in state tenders even if they are 15 percent
more expensive, Sabah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
