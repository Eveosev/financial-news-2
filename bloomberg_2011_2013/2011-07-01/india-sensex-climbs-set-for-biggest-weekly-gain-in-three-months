India’s benchmark stock index fell,
halting a six-day advance, as some investors judged the rally
excessive and as the nation’s manufacturing grew at the slowest
pace in nine months.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , India’s biggest automaker, slid
to a one-week low after sales declined for the first time since
December 2008 as a strike curbed production.  Hindustan Unilever
Ltd. (HUVR) , India’s biggest home-products maker, lost 2 percent.
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the most valuable company, lost the
most in 10 days. The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 55.3 in
June from 57.5 in May, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said today. A number above 50 indicates expansion.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, fell
83.07, or 0.4 percent, to 18,762.80 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai. Still, the gauge, which jumped 7.4 percent in six days
before today, rose 2.9 percent this week, the most since the
five days ended April 1.  “The concerns on inflation and  interest rates  are not
completely over but the mood has turned positive over the past
few days,” said Suhas Samant, a  fund manager  at Mumbai-based
Sharekhan Ltd. “It’s logical that some investors will book
profit as the rally has been sharp.” He’s avoiding shares of
automakers and sold  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , India’s biggest producer,
and  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the largest mobile-phone operator.  The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange lost
0.4 percent to 5,627.20 and its July futures settled at
5,632.85. The BSE 200 Index was unchanged.  Maruti fell 1.4 percent to 1,143.15 rupees, its lowest
level since June 24. The carmaker sold 80,298 vehicles in June,
compared with 88,091 units a year ago, according to an e-mailed
statement today. Local sales dropped 3.8 percent to 70,020 and
exports tumbled 33 percent.  Dismissed Workers  Workers ended an 11-day strike at its Manesar plant near
 New Delhi  on June 17 after the company agreed to take back
dismissed employees. The strike at the factory, which builds as
many as 1,200 cars daily, cost the Indian unit of Suzuki Motor
Corp. $9 million a day, Chairman R.C. Bhargava said June 8.  Hindustan Unilever dropped 2 percent to 336.75 rupees,
falling from its highest close at least since 1991. Reliance
plunged 4.1 percent to 861.95 rupees and its July futures
settled at 866.35 rupees.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the nation’s largest state-owned
oil explorer, climbed 0.8 percent to 276.35 rupees after the
government made the recovery of royalty payments a condition for
the planned acquisition of a stake by Vedanta Resources Plc in
Cairn India Ltd. ONGC currently bears the entire royalty burden
from Cairn India’s Rajasthan field.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest developer, surged 4.7 percent to
220.3 rupees after the Economic Times newspaper reported the
company may sell its stake in special economic zones in Pune and
Noida to cut debt. Managing Director T.C. Goyal couldn’t
immediately be reached at his office for a comment.  Tata Steel lost 1.3 percent to 602.3 rupees. Bharti Airtel
sank 2.9 percent to 383.45 rupees, the most since May 5.  Worst Performer  The Sensex has dropped 8.5 percent this year, the worst
performer among benchmark indexes in the 20 biggest markets,
after the central bank raised rates four times in 2011 to tackle
rising consumer and food prices. The $1.4 trillion economy grew
7.8 percent in the three months through March, the weakest pace
in five quarters. Sensex companies are valued at 15.2 times
estimated earnings, compared with 11.1 for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
June 16 he’s willing to risk a slowdown in growth to restrict
inflation running at more than twice the rate in the U.S. and
almost four times  Germany ’s. Price gains are India’s “most
significant near-term macroeconomic challenge,” Deputy Governor
Subir Gokarn said this week.  India’s $1.4 trillion economy expanded 7.8 percent in the
three months through March, the slowest pace in five quarters.
Some 33 percent of the companies on the Sensex reported profits
that missed analysts’ estimates in the March quarter, compared
with less than a quarter that did so last year.  Overseas funds bought a net 7.72 billion rupees ($171.7
million) of Indian stocks on June 29, raising total investment
in equities this year to 26.7 billion rupees, according to data
on the  website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
