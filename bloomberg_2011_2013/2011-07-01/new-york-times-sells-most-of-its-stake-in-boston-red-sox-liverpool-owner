New York Times Co. (NYT)  sold more than
half its stake in Fenway Sports Group, owner of assets including
the Boston  Red Sox  and the Liverpool Football Club.  New York Times sold 390 of its 700 Class B units for $117
million in cash to three separate buyers, the company said in a
securities filing today. It didn’t identify the buyers and said
an estimated pretax gain of $64 million will be recorded in the
third quarter for the transactions completed today.  Fenway Sports Group owns the Red Sox baseball team,
Liverpool of the English Premier League, about 80 percent of the
regional sports network that broadcasts Red Sox games and 50
percent of a Nascar racing team. The Red Sox are worth about
$912 million, according to an estimate from Forbes magazine.  Times Co. said in 2009 that it had hired  Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)  to sell its stake in the sports venture. Robert Christie, a New York Times spokesman, said the remainder of the
company’s stake is still on the market.  The New York-based company has been struggling with
declining revenue as readers of its New York Times and Boston
Globe newspapers have migrated online for their news. In the
first quarter, sales dropped to $566.5 million from $587.9
million a year earlier, as advertising and circulation revenue
slid. In response, the company this year introduced an online
paid subscription model for the New York newspaper, and plans to
do the same at its Boston newspaper later this year.  New York Times fell 1 cent to $8.71 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange trading and has dropped 11 percent this year.  Fenway Sports  Fenway Sports Group is majority-owned by  John Henry , a
commodities hedge-fund billionaire. Henry bought the Red Sox in
2002 and the team won the  World Series  in 2004, ending an 86-
year wait between championships. The team won the championship
again in 2007.  Fenway agreed to buy Liverpool in October 2010 in a forced
sale for 300 million pounds (then equivalent to $476 million)
from  George Gillett  and  Tom Hicks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
