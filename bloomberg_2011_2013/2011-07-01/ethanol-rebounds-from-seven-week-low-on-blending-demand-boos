Ethanol futures rebounded from the
lowest level in almost seven weeks in  Chicago  as the biofuel’s
discount to gasoline gave refiners an incentive to use more.  The grain-based gasoline additive rose a day after its
discount to gasoline widened to 47.6 cents, the highest level in
four weeks. Refiners are able to capture the spread between the
two fuels in addition to pocketing a 45-cent tax credit, known
as the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit, or VEETC, for each
gallon of ethanol blended into gasoline.  “You’ve put a lot more margin into the blender,” said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “At these
levels, even if you take away the VEETC, they’re still making
money hand over fist.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery rose 5.2 cents, or 2
percent, to settle at $2.607 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. It fell yesterday to $2.555, the lowest price since May
16.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast fell 6.5
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.725 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive declined 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.725,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slid 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.62 a
gallon and in  New York  the biofuel lost 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.72.  Based on today’s prices, ethanol traded at a 36.56-cent
discount to gasoline. That compares to a 14.36-cent difference a
week ago.  Gasoline for August delivery rose 0.34 cent to settle at
$2.9726 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
