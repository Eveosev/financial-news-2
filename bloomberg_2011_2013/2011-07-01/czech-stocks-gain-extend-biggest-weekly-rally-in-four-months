Czech stocks gained for a fourth day,
extending the index’s biggest weekly rally in more than three
months as optimism  Greece  will avert a default and a rise in
U.S. manufacturing data fueled investor demand for risk.  The benchmark PX gauge added 0.8 percent to 1,235.5 at its
4:28 p.m. close in Prague. It advanced 2.5 percent this week,
the most since the five days through March 25. Austria’s  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS)  led the rally, rising 2.7 percent to 882.2 koruna.  Stocks worldwide extended gains after a U.S. report showed
manufacturing in the world’s largest economy unexpectedly picked
up in June. Greece may receive as much as 85 billion euros ($123
billion) in a second bailout aimed at preventing default, an
Austrian Finance Ministry official said today.  “A temporary easing of the Greek debt crisis after
Greece’s parliament approved reform laws encourages buying
again,” Dusan Jilcik, a stock analyst at Cyrrus brokerage in
Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in a report to clients today.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the biggest Czech power utility, added 0.5 percent
to 867.1 koruna.  Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CETV)  tumbled
3.2 percent to 325.1 koruna, its lowest close in five months,
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. downgraded the broadcaster’s
shares to “sell” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
