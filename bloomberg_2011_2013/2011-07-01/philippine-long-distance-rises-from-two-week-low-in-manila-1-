Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co. (TEL)  shares climbed the most in almost two weeks as some
investors took advantage of a two-day slump to buy stock in the
nation’s largest telecommunications company, said Jonathan Ravelas, chief market strategist at Banco de Oro Unibank Inc.  The company’s stock jumped 2.9 percent, the most since June
21, to 2,380 pesos as of the noon close in Manila. The benchmark
Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 1.4 percent.  PLDT shares had slumped 3.7 percent in the previous two
days to the lowest close since June 17 as the Philippines’
Supreme Court ordered the Securities and Exchange Commission to
investigate the company on the possible violation of a
constitutional cap on foreign ownership. Philippine President
Benigno Aquino said yesterday that the government will study the
court order.  “People saw opportunities to buy the company,” Ravelas
said. “It’s a very good entry price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
