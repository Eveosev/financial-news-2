The pound erased a 0.6 percent
decline against the euro, retreating from a 15-month low and
paring its steepest weekly drop in a month.  Sterling was little changed at 90.361 pence to the euro as
of 2:19 p.m. in  London , after reaching 90.84 pence, the weakest
intraday level since March 2010. The move pared the poundâ€™s
decline this past week to 1.6 percent, the steepst since the
five days ended June 3.  The pound has traded weaker than 90 pence per euro for each
of the last three days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
