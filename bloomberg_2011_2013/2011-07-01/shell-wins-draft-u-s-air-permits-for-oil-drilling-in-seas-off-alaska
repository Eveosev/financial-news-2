Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  received draft
U.S. air quality permits for oil drilling in  Alaska ’s Chukchi
and Beaufort seas.  The Environmental Protection Agency’s permits, which are
subject to 30 days of public comment, were issued today after
the Environmental Appeals Board overturned previous approvals
last year. The Hague-based company also needs authorization from
 the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
Enforcement  to begin exploration.  Shell acquired oil leases in the  Beaufort Sea  in 2005, and
added Chukchi Sea leases in 2008. The company has said it plans
to drill as many as two wells a year in the Beaufort Sea, and as
many as three a year in the Chukchi Sea from 2012 through 2013.  Shell’s spokesman Curtis Smith didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mailed request for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
