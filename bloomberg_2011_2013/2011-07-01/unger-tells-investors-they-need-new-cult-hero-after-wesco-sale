Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Vice Chairman
Charles Munger, who is holding a meeting with investors today,
said the session will be the last of its kind that he hosts.  “You all need a new cult hero,” Munger, 87, said today at
a gathering in Pasadena, California. “I’m not doing you a
disfavor, I’m’ doing you a favor” by halting the annual
tradition.  Munger is hosting a “Morning With Charlie” today to
replace the annual shareholder meeting of Wesco Financial Corp.,
the Berkshire unit that he ran as chief executive officer. Wesco
is no longer publicly traded after Berkshire, led by Chairman
 Warren Buffett , acquired its remaining stock last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
