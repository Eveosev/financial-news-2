German Deputy Foreign Minister Werner Hoyer said the European Union budget proposed by the European
Commission is unacceptable,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an
interview.  More than 60 billion euros ($ 87.2 billion) are “hidden”
in funds outside the budget, Hoyer said, according to the
report. He also criticized plans to introduce a tax directly
assigned to the EU, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
