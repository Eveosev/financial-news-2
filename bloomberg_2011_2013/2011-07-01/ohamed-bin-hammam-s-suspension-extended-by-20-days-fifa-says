FIFA extended Mohamed  Bin Hammam ’s
suspension over bribery allegations by 20 days, world soccer’s
governing body said today.  Bin Hammam, the head of Asian soccer, was provisionally
suspended 30 days on May 29 after FIFA received evidence he
allegedly tried to bribe officials in the Caribbean to vote for
him in the Zurich-based organization’s presidential election on
June 1.  “With regards to the duration of the provisional
suspension, we highlighted at the time of the opening of the
ethic committee investigation that the provisional suspension
could be extended by a period of 20 days,”  FIFA  said in a
statement, without giving a reason for the extension.  FIFA last week dropped its inquiry into  Jack Warner , one of
the body’s vice presidents suspended along with Bin Hammam,
after he resigned from all soccer activities. It said “the
presumption of innocence is maintained,” even though a
preliminary report seen by Bloomberg News said there was
“comprehensive, convincing and overwhelming” evidence against
him.  Former FBI Director Louis Freeh was hired in May to
investigate allegations Warner arranged a meeting in his native
 Trinidad and Tobago  where witnesses claim $40,000 in cash was
handed out to Caribbean soccer officials.  Bin Hammam, who withdrew challenging FIFA president Sepp Blatter hours before he was suspended, declined to comment. He’s
consistently denied the bribery claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
