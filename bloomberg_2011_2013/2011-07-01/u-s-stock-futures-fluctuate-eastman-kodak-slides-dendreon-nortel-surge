U.S. stocks advanced, sending
benchmark indexes to their highest levels since May and the
biggest weekly gains in almost two years, amid an unexpected
pickup in American manufacturing growth.  Home Depot Inc. (HD) ,  3M Co. (MMM)  and  Intel Corp. (INTC)  rallied at least
1.4 percent, pacing gains among companies most-dependent on
economic growth.  Apollo Group Inc. (APOL)  jumped 6.4 percent as the
operator of for-profit schools reported earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates. KB Home climbed 4 percent as the
homebuilder said it doesn’t plan to issue equity.  Eastman Kodak
Co. (EK)  tumbled 14 percent after a ruling on patent claims against
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  was postponed.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.4 percent to
1,339.67 at 4 p.m. in New York. The index rallied 5.6 percent
this week, the most since July 2009. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  gained 168.43 points, or 1.4 percent, to 12,582.77.
About 6.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges at 4:27
p.m., 12 percent less than the three-month average through
yesterday ahead of the Independence Day holiday.  “Clearly, today is good news with the manufacturing
data,” said Michael Vogelzang, chief investment officer at
Boston Advisors LLC, which manages $1.9 billion. “This is just
a recovery off of a very difficult period. People are putting
the risk trade back on.”  The  S&P 500  fell 1.8 percent in June, spurring the first
quarterly loss in a year, on concern about Europe’s debt crisis
and weaker-than-expected economic data. The index was still up
6.5 percent in 2011 as government stimulus measures and higher-
than-estimated corporate earnings lifted investors’ confidence.  Manufacturing Expands  Stocks extended gains after a report showed that U.S.
manufacturing unexpectedly expanded at a faster pace in June, a
sign the industry is rebounding after shortages of parts and
components from Japan slowed production. The Institute for
Supply Management’s factory index rose to 55.3 last month from
53.5 in May. Economists estimated the index would drop to 52,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  The ISM report was a positive surprise at a time when
manufacturing growth is slowing from China to  Europe , creating a
dilemma for central bankers considering higher  interest rates  to
combat inflation. China’s factory index fell to the lowest level
since February 2009, while in the 17-nation euro area, a gauge
slipped to an 18-month low. German manufacturing expanded at the
weakest pace in 17 months, while Italy, Ireland, Spain and
Greece contracted.  Greece’s Financing  Global stocks also rose. Greece may receive as much as 85
billion euros ($124 billion) in new financing, including a
contribution from private investors, in a second bailout aimed
at preventing default and ending the euro-region’s debt crisis,
according to an Austrian Finance Ministry official.  “Greece is probably going to avert the default,” said  Don Wordell , a  fund manager  for Atlanta-based RidgeWorth Capital
Management, which oversees about $48 billion. “It’s a long
process, but near-term, I believe they will resolve everything
they need there.”  Stocks should rally during the second half of the year,
sending the S&P 500 to 1,550 by the end of 2011, as corporate
earnings grow and equities remain cheap, Deutsche Bank AG said.  Equities are less expensive, earnings will expand faster
than the U.S. economy and there will be a pickup in growth for
domestic cyclical industries such as financials, industrials and
technology, Bankim “Binky” Chadha, Deutsche Bank’s New York-
based chief U.S. equity strategist, said.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index added 1.9 percent as 29
of its 30 stocks gained. The Dow Jones Transportation Average of
20 stocks, a proxy for economic growth, rose 2.3 percent.  Home Depot Rallies  Home Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,
added 1.4 percent to $36.73. 3M rose 1.9 percent to $96.67.
Intel increased 1.7 percent to $22.53.  Apollo Group gained 6.4 percent to $46.46. The operator of
for-profit schools forecast fiscal year 2012 revenue of as much
as $4.25 billion, versus an average analyst estimate is for
sales of $4.13 billion. The company also reaffirmed its
projection for fiscal year 2011 revenue.  KB Home (KBH)  added 4 percent to $10.17 as investors became less
concerned about capital dilution after the Los Angeles-based
homebuilder provided additional details on  capital structure .  Blackboard Inc. (BBBB)  rallied 1.8 percent to $44.17. Providence
Equity Partners Inc. agreed to buy the maker of online
educational software for $1.64 billion. Providence will pay $45
a share in cash. The price represents a 21 percent premium over
Blackboard’s closing price on April 18, the day before the
company said it would evaluate strategic alternatives.  Eastman Kodak tumbled 14 percent to $3.07. The ruling faces
at least a two-month delay after a trade panel ordered a judge
to take a second look at the patent in dispute. Kodak is
counting on the case to help extract $1 billion in licensing
fees from Apple and RIM.  To contact the reporters on this story:
