Ecuador ’s Finance Ministry said the
Export-Import Bank of  China  will lend the country $571 million
to build a hydroelectric plant, the second loan from the Asian
nation announced this week.  China and Ecuador will sign the 15-year, 6.35-percent loan
in Beijing in August, the ministry said today in an e-mailed
statement. It will pay for 85 percent of the cost of the 487-
megawatt plant, known as Sopladora, the statement said.  “These electricity plants will permit the country to have
sufficient electric energy to cover national demand,” the
ministry said in the statement.  China has become Ecuador’s biggest credit source since the
South American country defaulted on $3.2 billion of its foreign
debt in 2008 and 2009, as the world’s second-biggest economy
seeks to secure energy and commodities supplies.  Ecuador, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’
smallest member, received a separate $1.68 billion loan in June
2010 to build a hydropower plant in the Amazon region in what
would be the South American nation’s biggest engineering project
ever.  On June 27, Ecuador said it signed a separate $2 billion
loan with China Development Bank Corp. to fund budgeted public
works projects. That loan has an interest rate of 6.9 percent
and a maturity of eight years, according to the  Finance
Ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
