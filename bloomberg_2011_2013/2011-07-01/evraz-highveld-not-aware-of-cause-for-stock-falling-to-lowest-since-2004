Evraz Highveld Steel and Vanadium
Ltd. (EHS) , the South African unit of  Russia ’s second-largest
steelmaker, said it’s not aware of anything “within the
company” that caused its stock to drop to a 6-year low.  “All our fundamentals are still sound,” the Witbank,
South Africa-based company said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. “We’re implementing extensive maintenance to
both our structural and flat products mills to improve product
quality, mill availability and mill reliability. We expect the
maintenance work to be completed by September.”  The stock slipped 6.45 rand, or 12 percent, snapping five
days of gains, to 47.55 rand, its lowest closing level since
Nov. 19, 2004. Evraz Highveld has dropped 43 percent this year,
compared with a 0.6 percent decrease in the FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index, and giving the company a market value of 4.7
billion rand ($700 million). More than 174,279 shares changed
hands compared with the daily average over the past six months
of 81,560.  Mastercroft Ltd., a unit of  Evraz Group SA (EVR) , owns 85 percent
of Evraz Highveld, according to the South African company’s 2010
 annual report .  To contact the reporter on this story:
