JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  lost a bid for
dismissal of a lawsuit in which consumers accused the second-
biggest U.S. bank of wrongly cutting home-equity lines of
credit.  U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer in Chicago today
ruled the homeowners could go forward on some of their claims
against the lender while dismissing allegations that JPMorgan
had engaged in fraudulent practices.  “Plaintiffs’ allegations that defendant reduced or
suspended their HELOCs without adequate justification are
sufficient to state claims for breach of contract under
Minnesota,  California ,  Texas  and Delaware law,” Pallmeyer said
in a 42-page decision.  The ruling comes in a consolidated class action, or group
lawsuit, alleging that the lender had retracted or crimped those
lines of credit without any justification for doing so. The bank
had sought to dismiss the action in its entirety.  Thomas A. Kelly, a Chicago-based spokesman for the New
York-based bank, declined to comment on the ruling.  “We feel this is a really important victory for consumers
throughout the country,” plaintiffs’ lawyer Jay Edelson of
 Chicago  said in a telephone interview. “Banks had believed they
could act with impunity. We’re seeing that’s not the case.”  Edelson said the next step was to seek class-wide
certification. There are thousands of similarly situated
potential class members, he said.  The case is In re: JPMorgan Chase Bank Home Equity Line of
Credit Litigation, 10cv3647, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of  Illinois  (Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
