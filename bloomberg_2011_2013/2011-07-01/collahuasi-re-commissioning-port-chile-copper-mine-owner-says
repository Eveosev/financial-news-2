Collahuasi, the world’s third-largest
copper mine, is preparing to reopen its port in northern Chile,
six months after a ship-loader collapse killed three people,
according to  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , one of the mine’s owners.  “We are in the middle of commissioning that now,” said
Charlie Sartain, who runs the Zug, Switzerland-based company’s
copper business. He declined to elaborate in comments to
reporters today in Santiago.  Collahuasi’s operating company said in April that it lifted
force majeure on shipments after negotiating alternative routes
with local ports. The mine produced about 3 percent of the
world’s copper last year.  Xstrata’s copper production will increase in the second
half of the year and the company can meet its annual output
target, Sartain said today.  Xstrata and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  each own a 44 percent share
of Collahuasi and a group led by Mitsui & Co. holds the
remainder.  BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida in  Chile  and Freeport McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc.’s Grasberg in Indonesia are the world’s
largest and second-largest copper mines, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
