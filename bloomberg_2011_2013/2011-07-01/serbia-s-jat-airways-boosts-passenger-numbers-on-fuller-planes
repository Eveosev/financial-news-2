JAT Airways , Serbia’s national
carrier, said passenger numbers rose 19 percent in the first
half from year ago as it filled a higher proportion of seats on
its planes.  The state-run airline had 518,999 passengers in the period
and increased the  load factor , or proportion of seats filled, to
65 percent from 57 percent, the Belgrade-based company said in
an e-mailed statement.  The government plans to sell JAT in a tender this year and
is awaiting response from  Turk Hava Yollari (THYAO)  AO, also known as
Turkish Airlines, about possible partnership with the airline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
