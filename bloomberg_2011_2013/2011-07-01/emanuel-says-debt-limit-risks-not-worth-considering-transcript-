Chicago  Mayor  Rahm Emanuel , in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al
Hunt ,” said failing to raise the federal debt limit is “not a
realistic option” for the  U.S. economy .  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of six and a half weeks. Thank
you for being with us, Mr. Mayor. Let me talk about -  RAHM EMANUEL: Six and half great weeks. I’ll tell you -  HUNT: That’s what people in Chicago say. Let me ask you
first about the national picture. President Obama faces re-
election with an  unemployment rate  probably going to be around 9
percent, maybe in the eights.  No president since World War II has ever been re-elected
with an unemployment rate of higher than 7.2 percent. That’s
going to make it a very tough slog for him, isn’t it?  EMANUEL: Oh, I think I could say this for him. His attitude
and his perspectives, yes, it may be tough for him, but it’s
tougher for the people not - that can’t find a job. And his
focus is making sure that they have a job, or the ability to go
find a job.  They know, and it’s true he inherited one of the worst
economies since the Great Depression, not just an economy, but
sectors, the  auto industry , America’s industrial base on its
back, broken, the financial sector, credit markets on its back,
broken. So you couldn’t get a loan for your car, for a kid to go
to college or to buy a home. And he dealt with that and now it
is - he is making sure that the other decisions we make
strengthen America and strengthen the economy so people can find
jobs.  HUNT: Well, there are those, including some Democrats, who
say there’s no coherent economic jobs message coming out of
 Washington . Jobs have been - in your six and half weeks you’ve
done a lot for jobs out here, but shouldn’t there be a national
Democratic message on jobs and what should it be?  EMANUEL: Oh, there’s - we have a - first of all, I’m the
mayor of the city of Chicago, my focus 100 percent is the city,
solving the problems we have here so we can grow not just
economically, but you can also raise a family, raise your
children here, and your children feel as attached to the city as
you do as a parent or an adult. That’s my focus.  Second, as it relates to that particular question, it’s not
a message issue. It’s just actually policy, so you could talk
about the message. That’s the political part of it, Al, but the
best, and I know this for a fact, the president is focused on
what are the critical areas, like in technology, like in
infrastructure that will help America grow long term and create
jobs in the immediate time frame.  HUNT: Are there a couple things you’d like to see done that
would help everybody, would help Chicago too to help you add
jobs like you have with Walgreen, and United and the rest?  EMANUEL: Well, one is what is critical is our
infrastructure, and I mean our roads, our bridges, our schools,
our broadband. And investing in that area creates jobs today and
makes us more economically competitive, either as a city, a
state or a country. I’ve -  HUNT: - only about  deficit reduction ?  EMANUEL: I propose, and I - this is just me.  HUNT: Yes.  EMANUEL: But let me just finish one other thing -  EMANUEL: - by why infrastructure is also important. One of
the ways I was successful in getting some of the companies you
mentioned to place jobs here in the city of Chicago because, A,
we have a trained and educated workforce here in the city of
Chicago, and it’s convenient for them to get from home to their
office. And that is a big selling point.  When I went around at GE I said how many of you take the
CTA or mass transit to work? Seven out of eight hands went up. I
want to invest in our mass transit so we stay competitive. And
the reason Chicago won those jobs was because of the convenience
to get to work, so it’s a big issue. And if it’s big for GE in
their decision, well, it’s big for me as mayor.  The idea I proposed at the Conference of Mayors was you re-
allow corporations to repatriate their corporate profits at a
lower rate than the 35, 15 percent. And that 15 percent of the
revenue would fund a rebuild America jobs account.  In 2005 when corporate America had a lower rate the jobs
were not created. We let it -  HUNT: Didn’t put it back, but they spent it on dividends
and -  EMANUEL: Whatever they did -  HUNT: Right.  EMANUEL: - they didn’t do the jobs, which was the basic
explicit understanding. So this time if you did it, given the
amount of corporate profits offshore, being held offshore, you
wouldn’t leave the  job creation  to them. So you would lower the
rate.  I - a proposal I’m working with Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro,
and I proposed it at the Conference of Mayors, is lower the rate
one time, but whatever revenue, rather than going into the
general fund would go into an infrastructure rebuild America
jobs.  HUNT: But the joint tax committee says there won’t be
revenue that over hards (ph) and years it loses money.  EMANUEL: Well, they say over 10 years. First of all, I
don’t think they take into account the infrastructure. They’re
only taking, looking at this side of the ledger. You’ve got to
look at both sides. You need two eyes to look at it.  HUNT: So they’re wrong.  EMANUEL: Well, here’s the other way you could - here’s
another idea. The first $10 billion stays at the 35 percent
rate.  HUNT: Right.  EMANUEL: Everything after that drops to the lower rate. So
there’s an incentive and you keep then some of the higher. And
all the lower rate goes into the infrastructure.  HUNT: Have you got Republicans going on that?  EMANUEL: Well, I think, yes, because I think, A, here’s the
deal. This is me and my view. They’d be interested in the
reparation that repatriating, rather -  HUNT: Right.  EMANUEL: - of the corporate profits at the lower rate. And
I think corporate America would be into this. And I’ve talked to
a number of CEOs.  HUNT: Yes.  EMANUEL: And the corporate America also would be interested
in the infrastructure investments. And that would be a way that
I think you could with that really start, A, creating jobs
today, making the American economy more competitive on
infrastructure. And you would take two ideas that both parties
have advocated singularly and combine them to solve a national
problem. Now, there’s challenges to it, but that’s just one
idea.  HUNT: We’ll go to a real easy one. As you look at that
Republican presidential field right now, what, any surprises and
anyone (inaudible) -  EMANUEL: Is this a freebie for me?  HUNT: - tougher? Absolutely a freebie, and any one would be
the strongest candidate?  EMANUEL: Here’s what my view is on this. The Republican
primary voters will pick who they want. Then the general
election voters will pick who they want. Politics is about
choice.  HUNT: Right.  EMANUEL: I think the American people know straight up that
the president of the United States inherited one of the worst
conditions the country had been in over 70 years -  HUNT: Right.  EMANUEL: - and dealt with it. The question is who has the
ideas for the future. And I think they’ll see him with the right
priorities and the right values versus another candidate. That
is my belief because I think the president works tirelessly
about strengthening this country.  HUNT: And I’m going to get you to say which Republican
candidate -  EMANUEL: It’s not for me. I’m not a Republican. I think we
can establish this fact. I am not Republican primary voter.  HUNT: Mr. Mayor, thank you so much for being with us.  EMANUEL: Thank you.  HUNT: When we come back,  Michele Bachmann  makes a splash.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
