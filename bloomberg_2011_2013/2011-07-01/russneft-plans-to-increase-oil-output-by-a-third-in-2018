OAO Russneft, the oil producer 49-
percent owned by  Vladimir Yevtushenkov ’s AFK Sistema, plans to
increase output by 33 percent in 2018 through exploration.  The company aims to step up production to 18 million metric
tons, or 360,000 barrels a day, by that date, Moscow-based
Russneft said today in an e-mailed statement. That compares with
average output of 270,000 barrels a day at the end of May,
according to Energy Ministry figures.  Production peaked at 300,000 barrels a day in 2006 before
founder Mikhail Gutseriev fled  Russia , citing pressure from tax
police and prosecutors to sell the company. Russian billionaire
Oleg Deripaska’s subsequent bid to buy Russneft failed to win
approval from the country’s antitrust agency. In the intervening
period, output fell as low as 240,000 barrels a day.  Russneft also announced the sale today of the Orsk refinery
for an undisclosed sum to a group of foreign investors.  Yevtushenkov’s AFK Sistema has pushed for Russneft to
restructure since it agreed to buy the stake from Gutseriev last
year. Sistema may consider merging Russneft with its other oil
holding, OAO Bashneft, when it reduces debt to $4 billion, Chief
Executive officer Mikhail Shamolin said June 16. That may happen
within the next three years, he said.  Russneft said it’s seeking to increase reserves to 1
billion tons from more than 600 million tons through
acquisitions and exploration.  Sistema agreed to buy the 49 percent stake for a sum not
greater than $100 million. That stake may be worth $1.5 billion
now, Yevtushenkov said June 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
