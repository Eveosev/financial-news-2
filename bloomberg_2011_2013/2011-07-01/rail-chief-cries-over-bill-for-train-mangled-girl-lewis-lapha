Railroad magnate Collis P. Huntington
was traveling in his private car along the Atchison, Topeka and
Santa Fe tracks when the train plowed into a young girl. When he
saw that her right leg had been “cut off and mashed above the
knee,” Huntington offered to pay for treatment.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The victim, Johanna Grogan, worked at a hotel in Baring,
 Missouri , for $2 a week, and gave most of her earnings to her
parents, who lived nearby with their 10 children.  Back at the station, Dr. J.G. Welch examined her, and then
she was taken to a hotel, where other doctors were called in and
more of her leg was amputated. The railroad surgeon also paid
visits to the patient. In the end, Johanna died.  All the doctors submitted bills, totaling $486, and with
the hotel bill of $76 and the $60 to bury her, the total came to
$622. Huntington regarded that as “outrageous,” and felt he
was the real victim of the accident. By railroad standards,
these were insignificant amounts, yet instead of paying, he sent
in the lawyers.  I spoke with Richard White, author of “ Railroaded : The
Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America,” on the
following topics:  1. Corruption and Failure  2. Government Subsidies  3. “Destroy When Read”  4. Quasi-Ponzi Schemes  5. Animosity Toward Corporations  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
