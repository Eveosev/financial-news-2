Indonesia ’s rupiah posted the biggest
weekly gain since April after overseas investors added to
holdings of the nation’s assets on optimism the central bank has
inflation under control.  The government reported today that consumer-price increases
slowed for a fifth month in June, rising 5.54 percent from a
year earlier and easing from the 5.98 percent pace in May.
Global funds bought $118 million more Indonesian shares than
they sold in the week through June 30, exchange data show.
Offshore investors boosted  holdings  of the nation’s debt by 4.4
percent last month through June 28 to 235.18 trillion rupiah
($27.5 billion), according to the debt management office.  “Now that inflation is below 6 percent it has given  Bank
Indonesia  more credibility and this is important,” said Ho Woei Chen, an economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. in  Singapore .
“EU finance ministers will meet this weekend and they will
probably disburse the loan to Greece.”  The rupiah appreciated 0.6 percent this week, the most
since the five days ended April 29, to 8,549 per dollar as of
4:19 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency rose 0.3 percent today and is up 5.3 percent this
year.  The rupiah may further strengthen in the second half, Bank
Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution told reporters in Jakarta
today.  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos will meet his
counterparts from the rest of the euro region on July 3 and July
11 to discuss a second bailout. The parliament passed budget
cuts needed for  Greece  to secure financial aid this week.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds fell this week. The
yield on the 8.25 percent notes maturing in July 2021 climbed
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 7.54 percent,
according to prices from the Inter-Dealer Market Association.
The rate slipped two basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
