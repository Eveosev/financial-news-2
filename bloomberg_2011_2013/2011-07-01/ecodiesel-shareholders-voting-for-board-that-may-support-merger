Shareholders of Brasil Ecodiesel
Industria & Comercio de Biocombustiveis & Oleos Vegetais SA,
 Brazil ’s fourth-largest biodiesel producer, are voting today on
whether to form a new board that may support a merger with
Vanguarda do Brasil SA.  Shareholders owning 44 percent of Brasil Ecodiesel’s stock
are scheduled to attend the meeting, the Sao Paulo-based company
said yesterday in a filing.  The company’s shares fell 9.1 percent from May 12 through
yesterday, after Silvio Tini, a shareholder and director,
rejected the proposed merger that would create a 2.16 billion-
real ($1.4 billion) biofuels company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
