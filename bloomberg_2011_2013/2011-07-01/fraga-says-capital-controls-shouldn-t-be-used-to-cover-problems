Capital controls should be used as a
transitory tool to curb foreign investment inflows and not to
cover up problems in fiscal or monetary policy, said  Arminio
Fraga , former director of Brazil’s central bank.  “Capital controls lose their bite quickly as time goes
by,” said Fraga, founder of Rio de Janeiro-based fund
management company Gavea Investimentos Ltda. “They don’t have a
significant impact on the size or even the composition of
flows.”  Inflation targeting should be the biggest role for central
banks, rather than preventing capital inflows or using too many
so-called macro-prudential measures, he said at a joint central
bank and Group of 20 event in Rio.  Brazilian policy makers say they are using capital controls
to slow speculative investment, although this usually doesn´t
work because investors can find ways around the rules, Fraga
told reporters after the speech. Regulators can´t track money in
offshore accounts and derivatives, as well as the possibility of
portfolio investment being disguised as foreign direct
investment, he said.  “A lot of time you end up moving things into the dark,
which is a bad thing for policy makers,” he said.  Brazil  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  tripled taxes on
foreign investors’ purchases of local debt and imposed levies on
overseas loans in the past year to stem a rally in the real,
which has strengthened 49 percent since the end of 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
