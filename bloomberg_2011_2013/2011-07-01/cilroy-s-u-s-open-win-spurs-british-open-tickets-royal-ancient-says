Rory McIlroy’s record victory at the
 U.S. Open  has boosted ticket sales for the  British Open ,
according to Peter Dawson, chief executive officer of the Royal
and Ancient Golf Club of  St. Andrews .  Sales for the July 14-17 tournament have risen 20 percent
over the last time golf’s oldest major championship was played
at Royal St. George’s in Sandwich, England, eight years ago.  McIlroy, a 22-year-old from Northern Ireland, won last
month’s U.S. Open at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda,
Maryland, by eight strokes for his first major title. His score
of 16-under-par was the lowest in the tournament’s 111-year
history, one of 12 U.S. Open records he set.  “Rory’s win at Congressional has certainly injected a lot
of life into ticket sales for the championship,” Dawson said in
a telephone interview. “It’s very noticeable. It’s taken us
from a cumulative position of slightly ahead of the last time we
were at Sandwich to being 20 percent ahead at this point.”  Because the British Open is the only one of golf’s four
major tournaments to offer fans walk-up sales, exact ticket
figures won’t be known until after the final day.  “That’s presales,” Dawson said. “You can still buy
tickets at the gate.”  American Ben Curtis won British Open at Royal St. George’s
in 2003 by one shot over Fiji’s  Vijay Singh  and Denmark’s Thomas Bjorn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
