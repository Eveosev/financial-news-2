A European Union demand that Russia,
which is in talks to join the  World Trade Organization , scrap
import duties for three meat quotas may pressure prices in the
country, Interfax cited Russian Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  as saying.  The demand is “impossible” to fulfill and would
complicate domestic producers’ operations, she said today in
Yekaterinburg, according to the news service. The government
will proceed with WTO accession talks, it cited her as saying.
Interfax gave no details on the size of the meat quotas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
