Malaysia’s ringgit rose for a fourth
day, capping the biggest weekly gain since April, after global
funds added to holdings of the nation’s assets and regional
stocks rallied as  Europe ’s debt crisis eased.  Overseas investors raised ownership of ringgit-denominated
debt by 93 percent in May from a year earlier to 181.5 billion
ringgit ($60 billion), according to  data  published  Bank Negara
Malaysia  late yesterday. The currency completed a ninth straight
quarterly advance yesterday after Greek lawmakers passed a
budget-austerity plan to win further financial aid from the
European Union. Malaysia’s five-year notes pared a weekly loss
ahead of a central bank policy review next week.  “The market is reacting to the positive headlines even
though  Greece  by no means is out of the woods yet on its debt
rollover,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a currency strategist
at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .  The ringgit rose 1.2 percent this week to 3.0105 per dollar
as of 4 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, the biggest gain since the five
days ended April 29, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency strengthened 0.3 percent last quarter.  The nation’s exports probably rose 11 percent in May from a
year earlier after having increased 11.1 percent the previous
month, according the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey before a trade ministry report on July 5.  Overseas investors’ holdings of local debt included a
record 87.9 billion ringgit of regular  government bonds ,
representing a 6 percent jump from April, the central bank data
showed. Investments in short-term central bank and treasury
bills rose 5 percent to a combined 76.5 billion ringgit.  Inflation accelerated to 3.3 percent in May, the fastest
since March 2009, the government said on June 24.  “As for local rates, there’s an even chance of another
hike this quarter as prices remain elevated,” CIMB’s Ramanathan
said.  The yield on the 4.262 percent notes maturing in September
2016 dropped two basis points today to 3.51 percent, according
to Bursa Malaysia. The rate rose one basis point this week. The
price dropped 0.07, or 70 sen per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to
103.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
