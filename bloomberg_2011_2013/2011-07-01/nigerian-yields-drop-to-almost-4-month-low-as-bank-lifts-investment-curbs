Nigerian bonds climbed for a second
week, with yields trading at the lowest in almost four months,
after the central bank said it would today lift a curb on
foreign investors’ debt holdings.  The 5.5 percent debt due 2013 of  Africa ’s biggest oil
producer reached 9.35 percent yesterday, two basis points from
the lowest since March 4, according to data from the Financial
Market Dealers Association on Bloomberg.  The naira may strengthen to 145 per dollar by the end of
the year after policy makers decided to remove a requirement for
foreign investors to hold local-currency investments in
 government securities  for at least a year starting today,
Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Lamido Sanusi said June 23.  “We expect yields to keep downwards due to inflow from
foreign investors that can now hold debt positions and exit at
will,” Wale Abe, chief executive officer of the FMDA, which
groups lenders’ trading in the money market, said by phone.  Nigeria  had 4.5 trillion naira ($29.6 billion) in
outstanding debt in 2010, or 15.6 percent of gross domestic
product, Morgan Stanley said in a report this week, citing the
Ministry of Finance. This may rise to 16.7 percent of GDP in
2012, a “comfortably low level,” they said. Nigeria’s external
debt level is 2.4 percent of GDP and may rise no more than 3.8
percent by 2012, Morgan Stanley said.  President  Goodluck Jonathan , who was returned to power in
April elections, slashed almost 500 billion naira off a budget
adopted two months earlier, taking the final spending plan to
4.5 trillion naira. Nigeria’s Senate passed a bill last month
creating a sovereign wealth fund to help the country save more
of its oil revenue and funnel money into projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
