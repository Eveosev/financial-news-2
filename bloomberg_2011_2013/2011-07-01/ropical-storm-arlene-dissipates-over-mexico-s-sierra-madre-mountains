Tropical Storm Arlene, the first
storm of the  Atlantic hurricane season , has dissipated over the
Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico, the National Hurricane Center.  The rain-filled remnants of the storm system about 110
miles (180 kilometers) from the eastern port of Tuxpan, Mexico,
are moving west-southwest with 30 mph winds, the center said  “Satellite and surface data indicate that Arlene no longer
has a well-defined surface circulation,” the Miami-based agency
said in its last  advisory  on the system.  The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
