The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
led a $500 million financing round for a 100-megawatt biomass
power plant under construction in Gainesville,  Florida .  Bank of Tokyo was joined by French banks  Natixis (KN) ,  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA)  and  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, and Dutch banks  Rabobank
Nederland  and ING Groep NV to provide non-recourse debt
financing for the Gainesville Renewable Energy Center, the
projectâ€™s Boston-based developer American Renewables LLC said
yesterday in a  statement .  Gainesville Regional Utilities will buy power from the
project, which will be fueled by wood waste from logging and
construction, through a 30-year contract. Construction began in
March and is expected to be completed in late 2013. The plant
will generate enough power for 70,000 homes.  American Renewables is developing the similar 100-megawatt
 Nacogdoches Power  project near Sacul,  Texas . The company is a
partnership between Energy Management Inc., BayCorp Holdings
Ltd., Tyr Energy Inc.  The Granite Falls, Minnesota-based construction company
Fagen Inc., is building both plants, and some of its principles
are proving equity financing, along with the developer, for the
Gainesville plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
