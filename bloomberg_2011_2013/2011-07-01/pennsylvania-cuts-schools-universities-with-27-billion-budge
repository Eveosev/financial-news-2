Pennsylvania’s Republican Governor
Tom Corbett signed a $27 billion budget for the fiscal year that
begins tomorrow, beating a midnight deadline.  The plan Corbett enacted today cuts spending by 4 percent
from the previous year. It passed the House 109-92 late
yesterday, a day after the Senate approved it.  The general-fund budget, which doesn’t increase taxes, cuts
primary education aid by about 8.6 percent and reduces spending
on the state’s 14 universities by about 18 percent.  Pennsylvania is among 42 states and the  District of
Columbia  that initially faced combined 2012 budget gaps of $103
billion, and it’s the fourth year in a row of budget-cutting,
according to the Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a nonprofit group that focuses on issues affecting
lower-income Americans.  Republican Representative William Adolph of Springfield,
head of the Appropriations Committee, said it was the third time
in 40 years that the Pennsylvania Assembly had a spending plan
smaller than the previous year’s.  The state remains the only major natural-gas producer that
doesn’t demand money from drillers. Several proposals to
implement an extraction tax or fee, including one from Senate
President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, were not voted on.  Corbett had said he would veto any tax on natural-gas
drilling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
