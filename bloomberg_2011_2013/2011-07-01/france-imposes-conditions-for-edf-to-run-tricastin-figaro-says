France ’s nuclear safety authority
yesterday imposed 32 additional requirements for Electricite de
France SA to continue operating its No. 1 nuclear reactor at
Tricastin, Le Figaro reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The new rules, which would allow EDF to keep operating the
reactor for 10 years or more, come in the wake of the Fukushima
disaster, and seek to strengthen the reactor againts flooding,
earthquakes or fire, the paper said.  State-controlled EDF’s 58 nuclear reactors provide about
three-quarters of domestic power needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
