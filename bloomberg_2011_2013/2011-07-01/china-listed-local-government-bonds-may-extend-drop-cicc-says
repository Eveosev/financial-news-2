Bonds sold by local government-owned
investment companies in  China  and listed on the nation’s two
exchanges may extend declines as concern about their ability to
repay debt worsens, said China International Capital Corp.  China’s first audit of the securities, ordered by Premier
 Wen Jiabao , found liabilities of 10.7 trillion yuan ($1.7
trillion) at the end of 2010, with 79 percent being bank loans,
the National Audit Office  said  this week. A Shanghai municipal
government financing vehicle violated borrowing rules by using
working capital loans for the construction of long-term projects,
the 21st Century Business Herald  reported  on June 30.  The negative news may revive investor concerns about
refinancing risk, CICC fixed-income bond analysts led by
Beijing-based Xu Xiaoqing, wrote in a research report today. The
risk of a “real default” on the bonds is low in the short term,
they said.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
