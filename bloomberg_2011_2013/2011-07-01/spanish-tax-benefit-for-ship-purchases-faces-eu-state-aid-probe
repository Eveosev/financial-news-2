Spanish tax benefits for ship
purchases through a financing structure involving leasing
companies may distort competition and constitute illegal state
aid, the European Commission said.  The commission, the European Union antitrust regulator,
started an in-depth investigation into the tax treatment, saying
that it enables maritime-transport companies to buy vessels at a
discount of as much as 30 percent to their market price, the
Brussels-based commission said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
