Teck Kin Suan, an economist at United
Overseas Bank Ltd. in  Singapore , comments on the outlook for the
 Taiwan dollar  in a telephone interview today.  The bank forecasts the currency will strengthen 1.4 percent
to NT$28.30 per dollar by December and 5.2 percent to NT$27.30
by the end of 2012. It traded at NT$28.709 as of 11:39 a.m.
local time, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The central bank
raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.875 percent yesterday.  “The appreciation is expected to continue for  Taiwan  and
for the rest of the Asian countries.”  The gains are “used as a policy tool as Asian countries
are facing inflationary pressures from both a consumer-price and
asset-price perspective.”  UOB continues “to see the official discount rate rising
further in steps of 12.5 basis points each quarter, to 2.125
percent by the end of 2011” to counter price pressures.  “Near-term headwinds are still substantial, in the form of
U.S. recovery momentum concerns and  Europe ’s ongoing sovereign
debt crisis, which have been key factors in recent episodes of
the risk on-off environment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
