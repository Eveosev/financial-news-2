Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, deputy policy
chief for the ruling  Democratic Party of Japan , comments on who
should succeed Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  when he fulfills a
pledge to step down, Kan’s performance and the likelihood of
passing his legislative goals.  Yamaguchi, who spoke today in an interview, said he favored
National Strategy Minister  Koichiro Gemba  or Finance Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda  as the next prime minister.  On Kan’s leadership:  “I don’t feel his leadership as Prime Minister at all. He
should resign as soon as possible.”  On Kan’s successor:  “We should nominate Mr. Gemba or Mr. Noda. I want Mr. Gemba
to run and we have gathered a number of his supporters. We’re
waiting for the right time.  “It’s not time for a great leader as much as for team work.
In that sense, Mr. Gemba is fine and so is Mr. Noda as they’ll
both seek the wisdom of bureaucrats and the business circle.”  On when Kan may step down:  “The second stimulus bill will pass, and we’ll negotiate
with opposition parties on the deficit-covering bond bill and
renewable energy bill. We’ll get them pretty much resolved, if
not actually passed” this month. “The end of this month is the
limit” for Kan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
