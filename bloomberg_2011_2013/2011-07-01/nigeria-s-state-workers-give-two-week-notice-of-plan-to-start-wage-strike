State workers in  Nigeria  have issued
the government with a two-week notice of their intention to
strike over wages, according to Abdulwaheed Omar, president of
the Nigerian Labour Congress, and Peter Esele, president of
Trade Union Congress of Nigeria.  The labor unions plan to strike from July 14 to press for
the implementation of an 18,000 naira minimum wage approved by
parliament on Feb. 23, the unions said in an e-mailed statement
