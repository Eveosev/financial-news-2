Vietnam ’s five-year bonds declined
for a second day after the government lifted its year-end
inflation forecast, damping demand for debt. The dong weakened.  Consumer prices may rise as much as 17 percent in 2011,
compared with the outlook for 15 percent in June and a May
prediction of 11.75 percent, the government said on its website
yesterday. Inflation accelerated 20.82 percent in June from a
year earlier, the fastest pace since November 2008, according to
the General Statistics Office in Hanoi.  The revision “caused investors to demand higher yields,”
said Hanoi-based Do Giang Nam, head of  capital management  at
Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development, Vietnam’s biggest
lender.  The yield climbed one basis point to 12.47 percent,
according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate fell 13 basis points, or 0.13 percentage
point, for the week.  The State Treasury sold 1.65 trillion dong ($80 million) of
five-year notes yesterday at 12.3 percent, compared with 12.1
percent at the previous auction on June 23, according to data on
the  Hanoi Stock Exchange ’s website.  The dong dropped 0.1 percent to 20,590 per dollar as of 4
p.m. in Hanoi, and was down from 20,575 a week ago, according to
prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The currency may weaken 1.5 percent to 20,900 in six months
and 2.4 percent to 21,100 in 12 months, Shirla Sum, an economist
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  Hong Kong , wrote in a research
note yesterday.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set the daily  reference rate  at
20,618 today, unchanged for three days, according to its website.
The currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  --Nguyen Dieu Tu Uyen. With reporting by Diep Pham. Editor:
