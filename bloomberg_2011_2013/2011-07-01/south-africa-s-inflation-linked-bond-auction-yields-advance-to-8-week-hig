South African inflation-linked bond
yields rose to the highest in eight weeks at an auction of the
debt, after the central bank said the economic recovery remains
fragile and higher domestic spending isn’t pushing up prices.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  sold 600 million rand
($88.9 million) of the debt maturing in 2022, 2028 and 2033,
according to its data on Bloomberg. Average yields were the
highest since the auction on May 6.  South Africa ’s purchasing managers index fell in June to
its lowest level this year, adding to evidence that inflationary
pressures in the economy are abating. The nation’s consumer
price index rose to 4.6 percent in May, from 4.2 percent the
previous month, the Pretoria-based statistics agency said on
June 22.  “I don’t think we will see demand-side pressures coming
into the economy any time soon,”  Monde Mnyande , the chief
economist of the Reserve Bank, said in an interview in  Pretoria ,
the capital, after the release of the bank’s annual economic
report today.  Interest payments on inflation-linked bonds are indexed to
the  consumer price index . The bonds pay more interest if
inflation rises.  The central bank auctioned 95 million rand of 2.75 percent
inflation-linked notes due 2022 at an average yield of 2.58
percent, three basis points, or 0.03 percentage points, higher
than at the previous auction on June 24. It sold 210 million
rand of 2.6 percent linkers due 2028 at a yield of 2.62 percent,
one basis point higher than the previous sale, and 295 million
rand of 3.45 percent notes maturing in 2033 at a yield of 2.57
percent, two basis points up from June 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
