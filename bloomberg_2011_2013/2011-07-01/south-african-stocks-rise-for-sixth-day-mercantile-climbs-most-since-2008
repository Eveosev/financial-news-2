The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index

60.93, or 0.2 percent, to 31,925.47 by the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  African Oxygen Ltd. (AFX)  , the country’s largest
producer of industrial gases, closed at its highest since Feb.
4, gaining 60 cents, or 3.1 percent, to 20.25 rand. There are
“circumstances that may have a material effect” on its share
price, the company said in a cautionary announcement.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s largest gold
producer, declined for a second day, losing 6.70 rand, or 2.4
percent, to 278.80 rand. The spot price of gold fell as much as
1.4 percent to $1,478.83 an ounce. South African gold production
decreased 9.3 percent in the first quarter compared with the
previous three months, the Chamber of Mines of  South Africa  said

Earlier it plunged 26 percent to 40 rand. The group said in an

than six years.  Mercantile Bank Holdings Ltd. (MTL)  , the lender
controlled by  Portugal ’s Caixa Geral de Depositos SA, jumped to
its highest close since December 2008, rising 5 cents, or 20
