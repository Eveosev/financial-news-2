Tokyo  Electric Power Co. expects
generation capacity in August to fall from this month’s level
because of scheduled maintenance at a nuclear power plant,
possibly leading to planned blackouts.  Capacity is forecast at 55,600 megawatts at the end of
August compared with 56,800 megawatts by the end of July,
according to a company statement.  Peak demand for electricity this summer, projected at
55,000 megawatts, may trigger warnings by the government of
shortages and appeals to customers to step up power-saving
efforts. The Tokyo-based utility, known as Tepco, is trying to
repair damaged gas and oil-fired stations and expand pumped
storage hydropower generation.  “It will be very tough in August because we will only have
600 megawatts surplus,” Vice President Takashi Fujimoto told
reporters in Tokyo today. “It’s really up to how the power
restrictions will reduce the 55,000-megawatt demand we forecast.
We can avoid rolling blackouts if the power restriction measures
work well.”  Tepco plans to idle two reactors with a total capacity of
2,456 megawatts at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear plant, located
about 215 kilometers (134 miles) west of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
station, which was crippled by the March earthquake and tsunami.
The utility will shut reactor no. 1 on Aug. 7 and reactor no. 7
on Aug. 23, Fujimoto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
