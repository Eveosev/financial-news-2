Kenyan coffee growers face a
“serious” outbreak of thrips that may worsen at the end of the
East African country’s cold season, the Coffee Research
Foundation said.  “Coffee farmers are advised to perform regular pest surveys
in their farms to monitor thrips population and take appropriate
measures,” the Ruiru, Kenya-based organization said in a
statement published in the Daily Nation newspaper today. Other
pest outbreaks, including green-scale infestations and coffee-
leaf rust, may also increase, the organization said.  Thrips  are insects that feed on the lower surface of
leaves, buds, flowers and fruits, according to the website of
infonet-biovision, a Swiss non-profit organization. Heavy
infestations can cause premature wilting, delayed leaf
development and premature fruit shedding, it said.  Kenya  may produce 40,000 metric tons of coffee this season,
compared with 45,000 tons last year, according to the Coffee
Board of Kenya. Farmers harvest the bulk of their crop from
October through December, while a secondary crop is reaped from
April to June.  Sales of the beans resumed on June 28 after a two-month
break, where the average price for all coffee sold rose 5.8
percent to $311.67 per bag, according to the Nairobi Coffee
Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
