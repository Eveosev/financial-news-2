Taiwan ’s government bonds rose, with
five-year yields dropping the most in two weeks, as the  central
bank  revised its inflation outlook lower. The Taiwan dollar
advanced for a fourth day.  Central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan said yesterday the
inflation rate may be below 2 percent this year if typhoons
don’t affect food supplies, compared with a May 19 forecast of
2.1 percent. The currency advanced to the strongest level in
almost a month after the Central Bank of  China  (Taiwan) lifted
its benchmark interest rate by 12.5 basis points to 1.875
percent yesterday.  “Perng’s comment on inflation eases investors’ concern
over Taiwan’s inflation problem,” said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-
based fixed-income trader at Polaris Securities Co.  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most-
traded  government securities , fell two basis points to 1.153
percent as of the 1:30 p.m. local close, according to Gretai
Securities Market. That was the biggest decline since June 16.
The rate increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
this week.  The  Taiwan dollar  advanced 0.1 percent today and 0.6
percent this week to NT$28.780 against its U.S. counterpart. It
touched NT$28.658 earlier, the strongest level since June 3,
according to Taipei Forex Inc.  The monetary authority raised the rates on 30-, 91- and
182-day bills today by six, seven and eight basis points
respectively, with each one basis point lower than increases
made on April 1.  “The market was expecting the central bank to raise the
rates on short-term bills as much as last time for the authority
to drain liquidity,” said Leung.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.363 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
