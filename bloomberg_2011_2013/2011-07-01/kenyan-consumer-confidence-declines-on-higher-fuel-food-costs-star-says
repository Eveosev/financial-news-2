Consumer confidence  in  Kenya  dropped
in the second quarter because of increased food and fuel prices,
the Star reported, citing Melissa Baker, chief executive officer
of TNS-RMS Research Co.  A study conducted in the March to June period showed that
more than half of Kenyaâ€™s population expects inflation to
worsen, while half are negative about the future of the economy,
the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  The level of optimism about the economy dropped to 54
percent from 79 percent in September, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
