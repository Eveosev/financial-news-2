The Securities Investor Protection
Corp. said its board would decide in mid-September whether to
cover some investor losses from R. Allen Stanford’s alleged $7
billion  Ponzi scheme .  The Securities and Exchange Commission last month directed
the non-profit group, which receives funds from the brokerage
industry, to reimburse Stanford victims who bought fraudulent
certificates of deposit through his U.S. firm. In 2009, SIPC had
informally advised that its protections weren’t available for
Stanford investors, though it wasn’t officially asked to weigh
in on the matter until the SEC’s June 15 order.  In a statement today, SIPC said it would announce its
decision “on or about” Sept. 15. It also said Stephen Harbeck,
SIPC’s president, was already conferring with the SEC and the
court-appointed receiver in the Stanford case.  SIPC was set up by Congress to protect the customers of
failed brokerage firms. Eligible investors can be reimbursed for
up to $500,000 of lost assets, including up to $250,000 in cash.  Stanford, who was sued by the SEC and also indicted on
federal criminal charges in 2009, has denied all wrongdoing. He
is in federal custody awaiting a trial scheduled for next year.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
