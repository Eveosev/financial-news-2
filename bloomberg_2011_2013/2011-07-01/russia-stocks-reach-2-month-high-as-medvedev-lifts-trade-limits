Russian stocks climbed to a two-month
high after President  Dmitry Medvedev  lifted curbs on domestic-
share trading in Moscow and abroad.  The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose 1.9 percent to 1,698.10 by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the highest level since April 29.
The gauge jumped 3.9 percent this week, the biggest one-week
jump since Dec. 5. OAO Mobile TeleSystems, a mobile-phone
operator, jumped 4.9 percent, OAO Novatek, a natural-gas
producer, gained 6.3 percent and oil producer OAO Tatneft added
2.5 percent.  Medvedev ordered Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  to lift
restrictions on listings of Russian securities abroad by Sept.
1, the Kremlin said in an e-mailed statement today. He also
instructed the government to allow foreigners to open accounts
allowing them to trade directly in Russia, rather than having to
go through an intermediary, according to the statement.  “This is a major breakthrough,”  Luis Saenz , director of
international sales at Otkritie Securities Ltd. brokerage in
 London , said by e-mail. “If this takes place, all discounts on
local shares should disappear.”  The Russian government currently stipulates that GDRs
should account for no more than 25 percent of share capital,
which limits the issue of GDRs.  Lifting these restrictions should boost liquidity on both
global depositary receipts and local shares of Russian
companies, Saenz said.  “The headline sounds positive,” but more time is needed
to understand the “real event,” Saenz said.  The dollar-denominated RTS Index added 1.6 percent to
1,937.57 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
