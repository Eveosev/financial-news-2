Large-scale growers, sellers and
distributors of marijuana may be prosecuted in states that have
passed laws permitting medical use of the drug, according to a
 Justice Department  memo obtained by Bloomberg News.  The June 29 memo, from Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole to U.S. attorneys, says a 2009 memo issued by Deputy
Attorney General David Ogden -- referred to as the “Ogden
Memo” -- remains in effect.  The Ogden letter advised prosecutors that enforcement
efforts against people using marijuana to treat cancer or other
serious illnesses in accordance with state laws may not be “an
efficient use of federal resources,” according to Cole’s memo.
The Ogden memo was “never intended to shield” larger scale
cultivation, Cole wrote.  “Within the past 12 months, several jurisdictions have
considered or enacted legislation to authorize multiple large-
scale, privately operated industrial marijuana cultivation
centers,” according to the June 29 memo. “Some of these
planned facilities have revenue projections of millions of
dollars based on the planned cultivation of tens of thousands of
cannabis plants.”  State laws or local ordinances are “not a defense” to
civil or criminal prosecution of such cultivation, according to
the memo.  Josh Eaton, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag in
 San Francisco , didn’t immediately return an e-mail seeking
comment yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
