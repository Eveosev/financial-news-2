Mexico’s peso posted the biggest
weekly gain since January 2010 as concern eased that Greece
would be unable to resolve its debt crisis.  The peso advanced 2.5 percent this week to 11.6071 per  U.S.
dollar  at 5 p.m. New York time, from 11.9001 on June 24. The
currency gained 0.9 percent today and has risen 6.3 percent this
year, the third-best performer among the major Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg, after the Colombian peso and
Brazilian real.  “We are seeing a reverse in the market because of the aid
plan for Greece,” said  Ramon Cordova , a currency trader at Base
Internacional Casa de Bolsa in Monterrey. “Global risk can be
measured by the euro right now.”  The Greek parliament passed the implementation of austerity
measures that total 78 billion euros ($113 billion) yesterday.
Euro-area finance ministers will meet on July 11-12 to discuss
the aid package for  Greece . The euro rose 2.4 percent this week.  The yield on Mexico’s 10 percent peso bond due 2024 fell 1
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.21 percent today,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.05 centavo to 123.94 centavos per peso.  Traders triggered all of the $600 million in dollar options
available today, the central bank said on its website.  The bank has been buying as much as $600 million through
the options every month since March 2010 to bolster foreign
reserves. The options allow the central bank to accumulate
dollars, insuring against outflows of capital and limiting the
peso’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
