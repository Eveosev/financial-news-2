Ukraine’s five-month state budget
deficit narrowed to 1.58 billion hryvnia ($197.69 million) as
economic growth boosted  tax revenue , the  Finance Ministry  said.  The shortfall compares with a gap of 15.2 billion hryvnia
in the same period a year ago, the ministry, based in Kiev,
Ukraine’s capital, said today in a statement on its  website . The
deficit was 3.97 billion hryvnia in the first four months.  The government wants to keep the full-year shortfall at
2.7 percent of gross domestic product in order to qualify for
funds from the  International Monetary Fund’s  $15.6 billion
bailout loan.  Ukraine’s economy advanced 5.3 percent in the first quarter
of 2011, helped by exports and domestic consumption, the state
statistics office said yesterday. Tax revenue jumped by 51
percent from January through May from the same period a year
ago, ministry said.  Economic growth will be between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent
this year and 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent next year, the central
bank said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
