India ’s oil-product sales increased
for the seventh consecutive month in May, driven by higher
diesel demand from farms and factories running generators to
bridge electricity shortages in summer.  Fuel sales climbed 6 percent from a year earlier to 13.14
million metric tons, according to preliminary government data.
Diesel, which accounts for about 40 percent of sales, rose 11
percent to 5.86 million tons. Gasoline gained 8 percent to 1.35
million tons.  Temperatures as high as 44 degrees Celsius (111 degrees
Fahrenheit) in parts of western and northern India in May led to
higher diesel consumption by farmers and small businesses as
electricity supplies fell short of demand by as much as 11
percent, according to the  Central Electricity Authority .  Jet-fuel sales grew 8.9 percent to 458,700 tons and
liquefied petroleum gas, used as cooking fuel and to power
vehicles, rose 13.7 percent to 1.18 million tons.  Sales of liquefied natural gas climbed 14.5 percent to
736,900 tons, while kerosene use declined 2.4 percent to 734,000
tons. Naphtha, a chemical feedstock, gained 3.7 percent to
844,600 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
