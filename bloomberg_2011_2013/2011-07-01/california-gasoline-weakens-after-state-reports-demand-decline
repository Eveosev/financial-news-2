Spot gasoline in  California  weakened
against futures after a state report showed gasoline consumption
fell 2.7 percent in March.  The discount for prompt-delivery, California-blend
gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles widened 0.5 cent to 6.50
cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange as of 4:02 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The fuel gained 0.15 cent against futures
yesterday.  California drivers used 1.24 billion gallons of gasoline in
March, down from 1.27 billion a year earlier, the California
State Board of Equalization said in a report. Diesel consumption
fell 6.9 percent in March, the board said.  The discount for Carbob in  San Francisco  narrowed 0.25 cent
to 9.50 cents a gallon versus Nymex futures.  The premium for California-blend, low-sulfur diesel in  Los
Angeles  narrowed 0.13 cent to 8.5 cents versus heating oil
