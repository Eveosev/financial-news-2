Austrian export growth will begin to
slow down over the course of 2011, dragging down the Alpine
republic’s expansion by more than previously expected next year,
a government-sponsored research group said today.  Austria ’s 2012 gross domestic product, the value of all
goods and services, will rise 1.8 percent, the Wifo research
institute said today in an e-mail statement. It had forecast the
economy to expand by 2 percent in April.  The nation’s economy is expected to expand 3 percent this
year, Wifo said, raising its 2011 forecast for the fourth time.
The group said April 1 it expected 2.5 percent, after predicting
2.2 percent on Dec. 17 and 1.9 percent Sept. 24.  “Strong growth in  Germany  brought another strong expansion
of exports” in early 2011, Wifo said in the statement. Germany
accounted for  32 percent of Austria’s exports  last year. “In
line with the international environment, there are signs that
the expansion will slow down in Austria too,” it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
