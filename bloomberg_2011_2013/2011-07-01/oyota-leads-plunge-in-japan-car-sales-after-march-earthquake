Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Japan’s largest
carmaker, and Honda Motor Co. led a 23 percent drop in domestic
vehicle sales, the 10th straight monthly decline, after the
nation’s March 11 earthquake disrupted production.  Sales of cars, trucks and buses, excluding minicars, fell
to 225,024 vehicles in June, the  Japan Automobile Dealers
Association  said in a statement today. Toyota’s deliveries
declined 38 percent from a year earlier to 87,671, excluding
Lexus-brand cars. Sales at Honda, the nation’s third-largest
automaker, dropped 32 percent to 30,040.  Toyota, Honda and Nissan Motor Co. are working to restore
full operations after the magnitude-9 temblor and tsunami
damaged factories and caused shortages of parts and power. The
disaster further depressed vehicle demand after a government
subsidy program for fuel-efficient cars ended in September.  Even before the earthquake, the dealers association had
forecast a 13 percent drop in vehicle sales in  Japan  to 2.8
million this year.  Sales at Nissan, Japan’s second-largest carmaker, rose 4.2
percent to 45,113 vehicles in June.  Toyota expects global production to recover to normal
levels by November or December. About 30 types of car components
are still in critically short supply, compared with 150 in April,
the Toyota City-based company said June 17. The dearth affects
mostly electronic components, rubber and plastics.  Honda, Nissan  Honda, based in Tokyo, has also said it expects car
production to return to normal levels by the end of the year,
while Yokohama-based Nissan has indicated it expects to recover
by October.  Japanese carmakers also face possible blackouts after the
natural disasters reduced the nation’s power-generating capacity
by 8 percent. Carmakers and auto-parts manufacturers will close
their domestic plants on Thursdays and Fridays and instead
operate during weekends from July to September.  Toyota rose 1.4 percent to 3,345 yen as of 2:13 p.m. in
 Tokyo . The stock has dropped 8.4 percent since March 10, the day
before the quake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
