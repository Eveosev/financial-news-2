Makoto Noji, a senior bond and
currency strategist in  Tokyo  at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.,
comments on the  Bank of Japan ’s Tankan survey.  The quarterly index of sentiment at large manufacturers
fell to minus 9 in June from 6 in March, the Bank of Japan said
today. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was for a reading of minus 7.  “Though the index turned negative in today’s survey, it is
expected to improve as supply chains are restored. The result of
today’s Tankan is mostly in line with our expectations.  “The Tankan’s impact on the  bond market  is likely to be
limited. The market will focus on the recovery in production
after the March 11 earthquake, not just in  Japan  but also in the
U.S. and other countries. We need to watch how much production
and employment will recover in the U.S. during July and August.  “Japanese bonds fell this morning because stocks rose and
bonds dropped in the U.S. With the sustainability of a U.S.
stock rally being questioned, Japanese bonds aren’t likely to
keep declining.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
