If  Greece  were to default and force a
debt reorganization, the result might be bank runs, contagion to
other countries, triggering of credit default swaps and
political strife within  Europe , said Jeffrey Sachs, who heads
the Earth Institute at  Columbia University .  For that reason, he wrote in the Financial Times, while a
default can’t be ruled out, it shouldn’t be a first or early
resort.  The argument that a default is inevitable is based on the
claim that, since Greece owes foreign creditors about 120
percent of national income, servicing the debt will prove
unsustainable, Sachs said.  Average interest rates on Greek bonds are above 6 percent a
year and if the country had to pay that much, the burden would
indeed be impossible to bear; however, if a low interest rate
were to be negotiated and repayments extended over 20 years, the
debt could probably be serviced, Sachs said.  Assuming a 3 percent economic growth rate, the country
would be able to service its debt and cut the ratio of debt to
GDP from 120 percent to 70 percent over the 20 years, he
concluded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
