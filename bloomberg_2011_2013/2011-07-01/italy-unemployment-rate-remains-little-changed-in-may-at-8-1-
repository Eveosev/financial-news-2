Italy’s  unemployment rate  held at 8
percent in July, the National Statistics Institute said,
remaining near a two-year low after economic growth accelerated
in the second quarter.  The jobless rate matched the forecasts of 10 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Italy’s economy expanded 0.3 percent in the second quarter,
better than the 0.1 percent pace in the first quarter,
sustaining hiring. Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s Cabinet on
Aug. 12 pledged to ease hiring and firing rules in a bid to
encourage companies to take on workers as part of a 45.5
billion-euro ($64 billion) austerity plan announced this month.  “It will just make the unemployment rate more unstable and
linked to the economic cycle” as both hiring and firing
practices will be loosened, said Emiliano Brancaccio, professor
of political economy at the University of Sannio in Benevento.  Joblessness among those between the ages of 15 and 24
dropped to 27.6 percent in July, from 27.9 percent the previous
month, that statistics agency  said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
