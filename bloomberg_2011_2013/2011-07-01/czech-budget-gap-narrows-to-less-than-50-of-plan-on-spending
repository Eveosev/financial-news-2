The Czech  budget deficit  narrowed
from a year ago to less than 50 percent of the full-year plan in
the January-June period as the government reduced spending.  The central state budget, the biggest part of public
finances that serve as the fiscal yardstick for assessing a
European Union member’s readiness to adopt the euro, had a
shortfall of 62.9 billion koruna ($3.7 billion) in the first
half of the year, less than the 75.7 billion-koruna gap in the
same period of 2010. The deficit was 81.5 billion koruna in the
January-May period.  Revenue totaled 507.6 billion koruna, 0.3 billion koruna
less than a year ago. Expenditure was 570.5 billion koruna,
compared with 583.6 billion koruna. The government’s plan to
narrow the public-finance deficit to less than the EU’s limit of
3 percent of economic output by 2013 has helped Czech bonds
outperform German debt in the past year.  The government plans to narrow the gap to 3.5 percent of
gross domestic product in 2012, from the planned 4.2 percent in
2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
