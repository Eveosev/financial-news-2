Almost 5,000 homeowners have
permanently lowered their mortgage principal under an Obama
administration program to prevent foreclosures.  The effort has reduced principal debt by an average of
$70,000 per borrower, the U.S. Treasury Department and
Department of Housing and Urban Development reported today in
their monthly scorecard on foreclosure-prevention efforts.  Today’s scorecard was the first to report progress on the
agency’s principal-reduction effort, which began in October.  More than 21,000 borrowers have won temporary writedowns of
their principal since the effort began. Not all have been able
to make their mortgage payments, however, and more than 5,000
have dropped out, the Treasury reported.  In its summary of overall loan modification activity, the
Treasury reported that nearly 25,000 homeowners permanently
lowered their monthly mortgage payments in May, bringing the
total to 633,459.  To contact the reporter on this story:
