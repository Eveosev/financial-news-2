Leadership posts within  South
Africa ’s ruling African National Congress are seen by some as a
chance to get to the “trough of feeding” and some jockeying
for the posts show “crass materialism,  Zwelinzima Vavi , the
general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
said in an interview on Johannesburg’s SAFM radio station today.  The country’s current laws promoting the sale of shares in
assets to black investors will ensure that the country ends up
in the ‘‘dustbin” because they do little to transfer skills or
benefit most black South Africans, he said.  The labor federation, South Africa’s biggest, may call a
strike this year over the use of lowly paid foreign workers by
South African companies and the use of labor brokers, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
