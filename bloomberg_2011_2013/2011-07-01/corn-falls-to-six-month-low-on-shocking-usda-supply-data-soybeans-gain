Corn futures tumbled to the lowest
since December after a U.S. government report unexpectedly
showed reduced demand and a higher number of planted acres
reported by farmers this year. Soybeans and wheat rose.  Growers seeded 92.282 million acres of corn this year, 1.8
percent more than projected by analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey and the second-highest since 1944, the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday. Stockpiles as of June 1 were 3.67
billion bushels, 12 percent higher than anticipated. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. slashed its price forecasts for corn, soybeans
and wheat.  “The market is still adjusting to shocking USDA forecasts
for rising supplies,” said  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice
president at the Linn Group, a broker in Chicago. “There are
still people caught long and trying to get out of losing
positions.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 25.5 cents, or 4.1
percent, to $5.95 a bushel at 11:46 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $5.755, the lowest since Dec.
13. In June, the contract slumped 7.8 percent, the most since
January 2010.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest exporter of corn, wheat and
soybeans.  Soybean futures rose the most in six weeks on speculation
that reduced Midwest plantings will trim supplies from the U.S.  Planting dropped to 75.208 million acres, less than
analysts expected and below the 76.609 million estimated in
March, as farmers switched to corn, USDA data showed yesterday.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 22.75 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $13.165 a bushel. A close at that price would
mark the biggest gain for a most-active contract since May 18.  Wheat Rebounds  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 2 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $6.1625 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $5.92,
the lowest for a most-active contract since July 29. The grain
tumbled 8.9 percent yesterday.  Corn is the largest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is fourth at $13 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
