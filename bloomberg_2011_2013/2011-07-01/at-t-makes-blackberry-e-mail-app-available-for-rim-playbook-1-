AT&T Inc. (T) , the second-largest U.S.
wireless provider, said it will begin offering software to its
customers today that will allow BlackBerry e-mail on  Research in
Motion Ltd. (RIM) ’s PlayBook tablet computer.  The move, announced in an e-mailed statement, comes after
more than two months of testing. Dallas-based AT&T said April
19, the first day of sales for the PlayBook, that it wouldn’t
release the application until it completed its review.  RIM, edging its way into a crowded tablet field dominated
by Apple Inc.’s iPad, has faced mixed reviews from technology
columnists and other competitive disadvantages such as an
inability to connect to mobile-phone networks.  The app lets  PlayBook  users access other information from
their BlackBerry, such as calendars and contacts, without an
additional tethering option. Web access on the tablet requires
an additional monthly plan, AT&T said.  Verizon Wireless , which also sells the $499-to-$699 tablet,
is still evaluating the app and hasn’t made a decision,  Brenda Raney , a spokeswoman for the Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based
carrier, said in an e-mail.  AT&T rose 27 cents to $31.68 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario,
gained 8 cents to $28.93 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
