BYD Co., the Chinese automaker part-
owned by  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , has the
ability to recover from missteps, Berkshire Vice Chairman
Charles Munger said.  “I like the fact that when they fail, they just put their
head down and try harder,” Munger said yesterday at a meeting
in  Pasadena ,  California .  Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer,
bought 9.9 percent of BYD in September 2008 for $232 million.
BYD’s Hong Kong shares surged more than ninefold after Buffett’s
investment, reaching a record on Oct. 23, 2009. The stock has
since lost about two-thirds of its value as BYD’s vehicle sales
declined for 10 straight months through May and the company
reported an 84 percent plunge in first-quarter profit.  BYD’s auto sales have been pressured as  China  removed
incentives that spurred buying for cars with engines smaller
than 1.6 liters, such as the Shenzhen-based company’s F3 sedan.
Passenger-car sales on the mainland fell 0.1 percent in May from
a year earlier, the first decline in more than two years,
according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  The carmaker raised 1.35 billion yuan ($220 million) in a
share sale on June 30 in Shenzhen to fund research and expand
its manufacturing facilities. The company plans to introduce the
new G6 car model this year and appoint dealers in the U.S. for
its E6 electric car, Stella Li, BYD’s senior vice president,
said in a June 17 interview.  “They work so hard on engineering problems,” Munger said.
“I think that’s very good for the world.”  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
