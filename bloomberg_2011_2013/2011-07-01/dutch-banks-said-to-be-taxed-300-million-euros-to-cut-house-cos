The Netherlands will levy a special
tax on its banks to raise 300 million euros ($435 million),
enabling it to cut the duty on house transactions in an effort
to revive the housing market.  The Dutch government will today decide to reduce the
transaction tax to 2 percent from 6 percent for one year,
according to two people familiar with the matter. They declined
to be identified because the plan hasn’t been made public.  Rabobank Group, the biggest Dutch mortgage lender,  expects 
average  house prices  to fall 2 percent in 2011 and 2.5 percent
next year after dropping 2 percent last year and 3.3 percent in
2009. Last year, 126,127 homes were sold compared with 202,401
in 2007, according to national statistics bureau CBS.  The Netherlands, the fifth-largest economy in the euro
region, will miss out on 1.2 billion euros of annual tax income
because of the measure. To make up for the shortfall, banks will
be taxed based on their risk-bearing liabilities, one of the
people said.  In separate measures, companies that lend money to foreign
subsidiaries will no longer be able to deduct interest payments
from corporate tax, resulting in 340 million euros of extra tax
income, according to the people. The government will also cut
tax-exempt savings from gross salaries, yielding 500 million
euros, they said.  ‘Good Signal’  While the Amsterdam-based Dutch association of banks NVB
criticized the planned tax and said it may hurt mortgage lending
and the domestic economy, realtors welcomed it.  “This is a good signal to help the house market on its
way,” Ger Hukker, chairman of the NVM realtors association,
said in a statement from Nieuwegein, the Netherlands. “It’s
great news for every home buyer and seller.”  Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager last year extended a
2009 increase of the limit for mortgages under the National
Mortgage Guarantee plan to 350,000 euros from 265,000 euros,
seeking to shore up the housing market. That plan compensated
homeowners for 35 million euros of losses due to forced sales in
2010.  Declarations are forecast to rise to 2,000 this year from
1,341 last year, the organization handling the guarantee plan
said on its  website  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
