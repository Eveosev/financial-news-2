Iberdrola SA (IBE)  won a ruling from
 Spain ’s  Supreme Court  that temporarily blocks a rule that would
have allowed its largest shareholder to increase its  voting
rights , El Economista reported.  The provisional measure, taken by the court after a request
from Iberdrola, affects whether stockholder Actividades de
Construccion & Servicios SA will be permitted to vote its full
20 percent stake rather than be limited to 10 percent, the
Spanish newspaper said, citing unidentified people at Iberdrola.  A law was set to take effect today that bars companies from
limiting any shareholder’s voting rights to 10 percent
regardless of the size of their stakes --  a common practice
among several Spanish companies.  A Madrid-based spokesman at Iberdrola, who declined to be
identified, said the high court did suspend the measure in the
case of Iberdrola, when contacted today by Bloomberg News. An
ACS spokesman declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
