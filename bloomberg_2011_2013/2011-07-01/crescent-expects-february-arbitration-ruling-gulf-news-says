Crescent Petroleum Co. expects an
arbitration case against National Iranian Oil Co. to be settled
in February, the Gulf News said, citing Crescent’s Chief
Executive Officer Majid H. Jafar.  Iran ’s state oil company agreed in 2001 to supply 500
million cubic feet of Iranian gas a day to the emirate of
Sharjah through a pipeline built in part by Crescent. Deliveries
were to have commenced in December 2005, the newspaper said.  NIOC supplied “limited quantities” of gas last July
before halting shipments because of leaks in the pipeline, the
Gulf News cited Jafar as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
