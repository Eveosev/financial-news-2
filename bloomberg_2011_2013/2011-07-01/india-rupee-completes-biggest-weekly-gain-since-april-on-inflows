India ’s rupee completed the biggest
weekly advance in almost three months after global funds added
to holdings of the nation’s assets to benefit from growth in
Asia’s third-biggest economy.  The currency extended last month’s 0.8 percent gain as
exchange data showed international investors bought $794 million
more stocks than they sold this week through June 29. The
benchmark Sensitive Index of shares had a second weekly gain as
Greek lawmakers approved austerity measures required to win more
international aid and avert a sovereign debt default.  “The near-term undertone is bullish for the rupee,
tracking improved sentiment in the domestic stock market and the
euro zone,” J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based executive vice-
president at IndusInd Bank Ltd., wrote in a research note today.  The rupee strengthened 0.9 percent this week, the most
since the five days ended April 8, to 44.59 per dollar at 5 p.m.
in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
gained 0.2 percent today.  The economy expanded 7.8 percent in the first quarter of
2011, the second fastest pace among  Asia ’s 10-biggest economies,
government data show.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.11 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.19
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
