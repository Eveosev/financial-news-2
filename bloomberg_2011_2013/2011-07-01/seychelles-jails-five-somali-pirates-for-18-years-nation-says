A court in the Seychelles sentenced
five Somali pirates to 18 years in prison for attacking French
ships in the  Indian Ocean , the Seychelles Nation reported.  Supreme Court judge Duncan Gaswaga yesterday found the men
guilty of attacking two French fishing vessels with rocket-
propelled grenades and small arms, the newspaper said. The
attack took place on Nov. 17, it said. The pirates were captured
by the Seychelles Coast Guard with help from surveillance
aircraft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
