Estonia’s industrial production rose
at the slowest pace in nine months in May, as growth in
electronics exports moderated.  Production increased 26.1 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a revised 30.8 percent in April, the statistics
office in Tallinn said today on its website. Output fell 2
percent from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis.  The $19 billion economy grew 8.5 percent in the first
quarter, the fastest pace in the European Union. The expansion
probably slowed from the second quarter because data will be
compared with figures from the year-earlier period when Estonia
returned to growth after its worst recession since independence,
Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
