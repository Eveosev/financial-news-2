Czech manufacturing growth was the
weakest in 16 months in June as the pace of new orders slowed,
an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI was 55.1,
compared with 55.9 in the previous month, the lowest reading
since February 2010, the bank said today in an e-mailed report.
A result greater than 50 signals overall growth. Manufacturers
received a greater volume of new orders in May, although the
rate of growth slowed to the weakest since February 2010.  “Driving the overall moderation in manufacturing growth at
the end the second quarter was a weaker rise in new orders,”
the bank said in the Purchasing Managers Index report, compiled
by Markit, a financial information services company.  The Czech central bank is weighing the pace of the economic
recovery and inflation risks as its board deliberates on when to
start raising  interest rates  from a record low. Policy makers
voted 5-2 to keep the two-week repurchase rate at 0.75 percent
on June 23, with the two requesting a quarter-point increase.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI is based on data
compiled by Markit from monthly replies to questionnaires sent
to purchasing executives in over 250 manufacturing companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
