Serbia may limit financial
compensation for victims of Communist-era nationalization to 3
billion euros in order to avoid excessive public debt,  Vecernje
Novosti  reported, citing unidentified government officials.  Original owners or their descendants will be given back the
assets whenever possible while others may receive government-
issued bonds with maturities of up to 20 years, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
