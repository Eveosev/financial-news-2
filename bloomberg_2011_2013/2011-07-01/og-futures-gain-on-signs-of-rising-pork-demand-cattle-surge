Hog futures rose the most in almost
two weeks on signs of increasing U.S. demand for pork. Cattle
also gained.  Meatpackers shipped 10.1 million pounds (4,588 metric tons)
of pork in the first four days this week, up 24 percent from a
week earlier, government data show. Futures in  Chicago  rose 1.9
percent last month, partly on bets that meat demand will
increase during the summer grilling season in the U.S.  “You have to see what kind of movement you can get moving
forward,” said Dick Quiter, an account executive at McFarland
Commodities LLC in Chicago. “Today, we’re looking at more of an
evening-up heading into a long weekend.”  Hog futures for August settlement rose 1.475 cents, or 1.6
percent, to 93.15 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, the biggest gain for a most-active contract
since June 20. The commodity still fell 2.2 percent this week.  Cattle futures for August delivery surged 1.975 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $1.1285 a pound, the most in two weeks. The
price increased 5.2 percent last month.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 2.4 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $1.40475 a pound, capping a 1.4 percent
weekly gain. The price jumped 11 percent last month.  “Feeders are at a high price for mid-summer due to cash
movement in the past two weeks,” Quiter said.  The CME will be closed on July 4 for the Independence Day
holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
