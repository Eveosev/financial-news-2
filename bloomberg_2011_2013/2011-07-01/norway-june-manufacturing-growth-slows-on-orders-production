Norwegian manufacturing expanded at a
slower pace in June as orders waned.  A seasonally adjusted index based on responses from
purchasing managers fell to 56.1 from a revised 56.8 in May,
Oslo-based Fokus Bank said today in a statement. It was forecast
to be at 57, according to the median estimate in a survey of
five analysts. A reading above 50 signals growth. It was the
15th consecutive month of expansion.  Norway ’s central bank in May raised its benchmark rate for
the first time in a year and indicated last month it would need
to raise borrowing costs at least twice more this year as
capacity utilization reached a “normal level” and rising wages
threaten to stoke inflation.  The sub-index measuring orders fell to 56.4 from a 57.3
while the gauge for production fell to 58.1 from 58.2, Fokus
Bank said.  Norway’s PMI Index was started by Fokus Bank in 2004 in
cooperation with the Association for Purchasing and Logistics.
Fokus Bank is owned by Danske Bank A/S, Denmark’s biggest bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
