Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Vice Chairman
Charles Munger said  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and U.S. Bancorp avoided
many of the banking mistakes that led to the worldwide credit
crisis and recession.  Decision-making at  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest U.S.
lender by assets and deposits, has been “a disgrace,” Munger,
87, said today at a meeting in Pasadena,  California .  Berkshire is among the top investors in Wells Fargo and
U.S. Bancorp, and a regulatory filing this year showed that
Munger’s firm sold a holding in Charlotte, North Carolina-based
Bank of America.  To contact the reporter on this story:
