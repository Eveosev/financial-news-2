Mary Miller , the U.S. Treasury
Department official responsible for managing public debt, is the
Obama administration’s nominee for chief of domestic finance.  Miller, 55, would replace Jeffrey Goldstein, the Treasury’s
undersecretary for domestic finance, who plans to leave the
department at the end of this month. If she is confirmed by the
Senate for the promotion, Miller would advise Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  on policy issues concerning the U.S. banking
and financial systems and regulation.  As assistant secretary for financial markets since February
2010, Miller manages the Treasury’s public debt and oversees the
offices of federal finance, capital markets and government
financial policy. Earlier today she reiterated the Treasury’s
projection that U.S. authority to borrow under the $14.29
trillion debt limit would expire on Aug. 2.  Miller previously worked 26 years at T. Rowe Price Group
Inc. in positions including director of the fixed-income
division.  One of Goldstein’s responsibilities has been coordinating
the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of regulators
charged with preventing a financial crisis. The council is led
by Geithner and includes Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke .  To contact the reporter on this story:
