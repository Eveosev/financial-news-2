Emerging-market stocks are due for
“a strong rally” once there’s a plan in place to assist  Greece 
financially, according to Geoffrey Dennis, a strategist at
Citigroup Inc.  Timing has much to do with the call, judging by a report
that Citigroup put out two days ago. As the CHART OF THE DAY
shows, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is faring relatively
poorly for the third year of a  bull market . Its 4.3 percent gain
since October trails a 30 percent rally that started in October
2002, as well as a 51 percent surge that began in January 1991.  Dennis said the MSCI index will climb 31 percent in the
next six months, based on his year-end projection of 1,500. He
reaffirmed the forecast yesterday in an e-mail.  Even a temporary fix for Greece will lead to stock gains by
enabling investors to cast aside concern about the European
Union’s finances, he wrote in another report this week. Greece
moved closer to an agreement yesterday when lawmakers approved
an austerity plan.  “Market fears have grown recently of a ‘summer accident’
in Greece,” he wrote. A default would trigger a flight toward
less risky investments, a rising dollar and falling commodity
prices, which would hurt emerging-market stocks, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
