JA Solar Holdings Co., a Chinese
manufacturer of solar cells, agreed to buy silicon wafer
supplier Silver Age Holdings Ltd. for about $180 million in
stock to increase production of a key panel component.  JA Solar will issue 30.9 million of its American depositary
shares at $5.825 each to purchase Silver Age from JA Solar
Chairman Baofang Jin, who holds 70 percent, and another
investor, Shanghai-based JA Solar said today in a statement.  Silver Age’s Solar Silicon Valley unit “has key
technologies which can be leveraged to provide superior quality
wafer substrates for our high-efficiency solar cell products,”
JA Solar Chief Executive Officer Fang Peng said in the
statement.  The purchase, which values Solar Silicon Valley at 2.6
times their 2010 net income, will boost JA Solar’s annual wafer
production capacity to 785 megawatts from 300 megawatts.  JA Solar declined 6 cents to $5.49 a share as of 9:03 a.m.
in early trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
