Namibia  Power Corp., the state-run
utility, will build a diesel-fired plant at Walvis Bay, near the
country’s uranium mines, John Kaimu, the company’s spokesman,
said.  The plant will probably cost 375 million Namibian dollars
($55 million) and generate 22.5 megawatts of electricity, Kaimu
said in an e-mailed response to questions today.  NamPower, based in Windhoek, the capital, is looking for a
new site for a proposed 800 megawatt coal-fired plant after
Walvis Bay, situated on the country’s coastline, rejected plans
to build it near the city.  Namibia is  Africa ’s second-biggest producer of uranium.
NamPower is investing 9 billion Namibian dollars over five years
to expand electricity-generation capacity, according to the
company. It currently imports about half of the power its uses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
