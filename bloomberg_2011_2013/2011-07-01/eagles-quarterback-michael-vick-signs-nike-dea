Nike Inc. (NKE)  re-signed  Michael Vick ,
whom the world’s largest sporting-goods company had dropped as
an endorser four years ago after the quarterback admitted his
role in a dog-fighting ring, the player’s marketing agent said.  Chicago-based attorney Andrew Stroth declined to disclose
financial terms of the multiyear contract, which was reported
earlier by CNBC.  Nike spokesman Derek Kent didn’t immediately return an e-
mail seeking comment.  Vick played the last two National Football League seasons
with the Philadelphia Eagles after serving time in federal
prison on the dog-fighting counts.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
