Copper rose, capping the biggest
weekly gain since April, on speculation that  China  will refrain
from raising  interest rates  after manufacturing growth slowed.  Manufacturing in China, the world’s largest copper buyer,
expanded in June at the slowest pace since February 2009, the
China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said today. The
central bank has raised borrowing costs four times since October
in a bid to slow growth and cool inflation. Prices have fallen
for two straight quarters on demand concern.  “Many market participants probably believe there is less
need now to introduce any additional measures to tighten
monetary policy any further,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt.  Copper futures for September delivery added 2 cents, or 0.5
percent, to close at $4.3025 a pound at 1:14 p.m. on the Comex
in  New York . The price was up 4.5 percent for the week. The
metal gained 2.5 percent in June and dropped 0.6 percent in the
second quarter.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose $15, or 0.2 percent, to $9,445 a metric ton ($4.28 a
pound).  Aluminum, lead, nickel and tin dropped in London. Zinc was
unchanged.  To contact the reporters on this story:
