The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development doubled its  credit line  to UkrFarm Funding Ltd.
to $40 million to support farming in Ukraine.  The expansion will allow for loans to over 70 agriculture
companies in northern Ukraine, EBRD said in e-mailed statement
today. Ukrainian Agrarian Investments owns UkrFarm.  The investment is expected to improve  land use  and farm
yields and boost UkrFarmâ€™s arable land to 300,000 hectares
(714,316 acres) by 2013 from 250,000 hectares, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
