Vietnam ’s stocks fell, dragging the
benchmark index down the most in  Asia , after the government
signaled it may not meet its inflation target for the year.  The benchmark VN Index slid 1.7 percent to a one-month low
of 425.29 on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange at the 11 a.m.
local-time close.  The government estimates year-end inflation at 15 percent
to 17 percent, a posting on its website said yesterday, after
raising the target to 15 percent from 11.75 percent on June 3.
Vietnam’s inflation rate is “intolerable,” the  World Bank  said
last month in a report that called for the continuation of tough
monetary policy measures until the figure is sustainably less
than 10 percent.  “With a higher inflation target, deposit rates may be
pushed up to 17 percent to ensure positive real  interest
rates ,” Dao Nho Tam, deputy head of the research and analysis
department at Hanoi-based Alpha Securities Joint-Stock Co., said
by phone. “That in turn may boost lending rates, causing more
difficulties to businesses.”  FPT Corp. (FPT) , the country’s biggest publicly traded
telecommunications and software company, lost 2.9 percent to
46,600 dong, the biggest decline since May 25. Vincom Joint-
Stock Co., Vietnam’s biggest listed property company, dropped
2.9 percent to 133,000 dong.  The VN Index tumbled to a two-year low on May 25 after the
central bank raised rates every month this year through May to
combat inflation. Consumer prices climbed 20.82 percent in June
from a year earlier, the fastest pace since November 2008.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
