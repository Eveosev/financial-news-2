The  Confederation of British Industry 
said plans to erect firebreaks around the consumer-banking units
of lenders to protect taxpayers and depositors during financial
crises may hurt competition and damage economic growth.  The CBI, Britain’s biggest business lobby, said
recommendations drawn up by the  Independent Commission on
Banking  must take into account each bank’s funding models and
that a “one-size-fits-all solution” would force banks to
follow the same business model, stifling innovation, reducing
competition and increasing costs.  “These plans could result in riskier lending within the
ring-fence and cause significant disruption to banks and
businesses outside the ring-fence in the event of a crisis,”
CBI Director-General  John Cridland  said in an e-mailed statement
today.  John Vickers , a former  Bank of England  chief economist, was
asked by the government last year to recommend ways to boost
stability and competition in the British banking industry. The
Treasury spent 65.8 billion pounds ($108 billion) rescuing  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  during
the financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
