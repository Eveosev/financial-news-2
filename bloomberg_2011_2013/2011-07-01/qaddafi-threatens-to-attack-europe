Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  warned
 Europe  further attacks on  Libya  would prompt retaliation and
told supporters gathered in the capital today to “get ready to
end the fight.”  “If we decide, we can also take” the battle to Europe,
Qaddafi said, threatening Libya’s “enemies” with “an eye for
an eye.” Pro-Qaddafi protesters packed the Green Square in the
capital, Tripoli, and waved green flags including one which
Qaddafi claimed was the longest flag in the world.  Libya’s fate will be decided by its people and the West
should talk to them about peace, not him, Qaddafi said. The
people won’t accept a substitute for him, said Qaddafi, who
spoke in an audio message aired by state television. He urged
supporters to march peacefully in rebel strongholds.  “Like you marched today on Green Square, march on the
western mountain and cleanse it and march on Misrata too --
unarmed,” Qaddafi said to the cheering crowds. “If we don’t
get our oil back from Brega you should march there to get the
oil back.”  The oil-rich east is under the control of rebels, who are
trying to end Qaddafi’s four-decade rule. Last month, NATO said
its increased  air campaign  has “effectively” pushed Qaddafi
into hiding. Qaddafi today didn’t disclose his location.  Qaddafi is prone to “overblown rhetoric,” said Mark
Toner, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department. Still,
Qaddafi’s threats can’t be dismissed outright, Toner said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
