Argentina  shipped less than its quota
of premium beef to the European Union for a second consecutive
year, Ambito Financiero reported, citing government data.  Argentina exported 22,166 metric tons of the 28,000 tons
allocated to it by the EU under the so-called Hilton quota for
the 12 months through June 30, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper
said. In the 2009-2010 year, the South American country shipped
12,865 tons of the 28,000-ton quota, the financial paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
