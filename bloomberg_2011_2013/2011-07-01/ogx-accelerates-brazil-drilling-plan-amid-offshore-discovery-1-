OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA,
the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , will
accelerate drilling in Brazil’s offshore Santos Basin after it
found hydrocarbons in a well.  OGX found a layer of hydrocarbons 51 meters (167 feet)
thick at the Maceio well in the BM-S-59 block located 110
kilometers (68 miles) from the coast, the company said in a
regulatory filing. The find is 2.9 kilometers from OGX’s Natal
field, where the company previously discovered natural gas.  The discovery “will make a relevant contribution to the
development of our assets in the region and creates a larger
economy of scale,” OGX Chief Executive Officer Paulo Mendonca
said in the statement.  OGX, which plans to pump its first oil in October and reach
150,000 barrels a day of output in 2013, will invest $5.1
billion in the next three years to develop crude and natural-gas
discoveries. OGX reported two dry holes in Santos 2010. In the
nearby Campos Basin, OGX has had a 100 percent success rate.  OGX rose 34 centavos, or 2.3 percent, to 14.93 reais in  Sao
Paulo  trading at 10:29 a.m. New York time. The stock has dropped
25 percent, more than the 9.2 percent decline for Brazil’s
benchmark Bovespa index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
