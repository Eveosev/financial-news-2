Suntech Power Holdings Co., the
world’s largest producer of silicon solar panels, agreed to pay
 MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. (WFR)  $67 million and relinquish a $53
million deposit to cancel a 10-year wafer supply contract.  Suntech expects to incur expenses totaling $212 million to
end the agreement, which was signed in 2006 when silicon wafer
prices were higher than today, the Wuxi, China-based company
said today in a statement. Ending the contract will save Suntech
about $400 million on the purchase of 4,600 megawatts of solar
wafers over five years.  MEMC, a silicon wafer manufacturer and solar power
developer based in St. Peters,  Missouri , did not disclose the
financial impact of the agreement to end the contract.  Suntech’s American depositary receipts fell 12 cents to
$7.75 each as of 8:22 a.m. in premarket trading on the New York
Stock Exchange. MEMC slipped 14 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $8.39
a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
