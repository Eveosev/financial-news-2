Rainfall probably will be near
average in most of European  Russia  and in the main grain-growing
areas of the Asian part in July’s first 10 days, said  Russia’s
Federal Service on Hydrometeorology and Environmental
Monitoring .  Average temperatures will be between 1 degree Celsius (1.8
degrees Fahrenheit) and 3 degrees Celsius above the norm in the
Volga Federal District until July 10, said Roshydromet, as the
service is known. Temperatures are forecast to be between 1
degree and 4 degrees Celsius above the norm in the Central
Federal District, it said.  Temperatures will be near normal averages in some key
grain-growing regions of Rostov, Krasnodar and Stavropol in
southern Russia and the southwestern part of the Siberian
Federal District, Roshydromet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
