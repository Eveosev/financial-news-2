Uganda ’s central bank sold dollars in
the domestic foreign-exchange market for a second successive day
to stabilize the shilling after the currency fell to an 18-year
low yesterday.  “We are in the market basically still to deal with the
speculative tendencies,” Stephen Kaboyo, director of financial
markets at the Bank of Uganda, said in a phone interview today
from Kampala, the capital. The sale of dollars by the bank today
was “sizeable,” he said.  The shilling gained 1 percent to 2,565 per dollar at 11:07
a.m. in the city.  To contact the reporter on this story:
