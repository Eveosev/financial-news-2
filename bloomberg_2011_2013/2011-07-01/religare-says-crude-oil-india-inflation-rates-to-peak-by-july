     July 1 (Bloomberg) --Suhas Harinarayan, managing director
at Religare Capital Markets Ltd. in Mumbai, comments on Indian
equities. He spoke today in a phone interview.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
0.4 percent to 18,762.23 as of 1:45 p.m. in Mumbai, halting a
six-day rally.  On outlook:  “We remain bullish on Indian stocks in the medium term. We
expect inflation,  interest rates  and  crude oil  prices to peak by
July. We had anticipated inflation and oil to peak in April. We
expect Brent oil to come off 10 percent this quarter and expect
inflation to come down to 6.5 to 7 percent by the year end.”  On interest rates:  “We expect the central bank to hike rates by 25 basis
points. There may not be any further increase as inflation is on
a downward trend and IIP growth is also moderating.”  The  Reserve Bank  of India has increased rates four times
this year to tackle rising consumer and food prices.  On foreign fund flows:  “Declining crude  oil prices  will lead to a jump in flows
from foreign institutional investors. We expect fund flows to
rise this year as commodity prices come off.”  Overseas funds bought a net 7.72 billion rupees ($171.7
million) of Indian stocks on June 29, raising total investment
in equities this year to 26.7 billion rupees, according to the
most recent data from the nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
