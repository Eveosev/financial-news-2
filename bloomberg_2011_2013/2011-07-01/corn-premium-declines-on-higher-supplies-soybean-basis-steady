Cash premiums for corn shipped in
July to terminals near  New Orleans  fell relative to Chicago
futures after the Department of Agriculture said U.S. supplies
were larger than expected. The soybean basis was unchanged.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 65 cents to 70 cents a bushel above July futures, down
from 66 cents to 71 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis was 72 cents to 78
cents a bushel above the July contract.  “There’s some buying caution in the corn market with USDA
forecasting rising supplies and a slowdown in domestic demand,”
said  Dave Marshall , a farm marketing consultant for Toay
Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois . “Soybean
supplies are adequate, and there is nothing extraordinary about
demand.”  Corn futures for July delivery rose 11.75 cents, or 1.9
percent, to $6.4075 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Yesterday, the price touched $6.15, the lowest for the contract
since January 10.  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 16 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $13.2225 a bushel. The contract rose 0.2 percent
this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
