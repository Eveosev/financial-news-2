Royal Ahold NV, the owner of Stop &
Shop supermarkets, raised its dividend by 26 percent and said it
plans to buy back 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in stock after
fourth-quarter profit missed analysts estimates.  Ahold will pay investors a dividend of 29 cents a share,
the Amsterdam-based company said in a statement today. The
buyback program will be completed over the next 18 months.  The retailer is scaling back spending to enable it to cut
prices and use other promotions to win shoppers in the U.S.,
where the company gets most of its revenue. The company said
today it would continue to reduce costs and that 2011 would
remain challenging for the food-retail industry.  Fourth-quarter net income fell to 154 million euros from
267 million euros, missing the 241 million-euro average of eight
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter margins
were negatively impacted by cost inflation, it said. The company
reported in January that sales in the period rose 2.6 percent to
6.98 billion euros, helped by growth at its U.S. and Dutch
units, which includes the Albert Heijn chain. Ahold reiterated
its mid-term target for net sales growth of 5 percent.  Ahold has slipped 1.8 percent this year in Amsterdam
trading, giving the company a market value of 11.6 billion
euros. U.S. rival  SuperValu Inc. (SVU)  has fallen 16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
