  KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) 
increased 2010 profit by 12 percent because of increased  oil
prices  and a higher share of income from ventures.  Earnings rose to 234.5 billion tenge ($1.6 billion), the
Astana-based Kazakh energy company said today in a statement.  Profit growth was partially offset by the absence of a
repeat of the foreign exchange gain that amounted to 89.5
billion tenge in 2009, the company said. Excluding the foreign
exchange gain, KazMunaiGas EP’s profit after tax increased by 72
percent compared with 2009, it said.  KazMunaiGaz National Co., Kazakhstan’s state energy
company, plans to raise $500 million by selling a 5 percent
stake in KazMunaiGas EP to citizens of the Central Asian
country. State-owned KazMunaiGaz holds 61.4 percent of is
London-listed unit’s ordinary shares, according to the  Kazakhstan  Stock Exchange website.  KazMunaiGas EP boosted 2010 operating profit 21 percent to
187 billion tenge, the company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
