TPG Capital founder  David Bonderman 
said a $15 billion leveraged buyout is possible in the current
climate, with funding available “on attractive terms.”  “We are back in the environment which is about as good as
it has ever been, not quite at the amount of volumes in the days
of 2006 and 2007 when we could to a $20 billion or $40 billion
buyout,” he said at the SuperReturn conference today in Berlin.
“It’s absolutely possible to do a $10 billion to $15 billion
deal. The capital is available.”  Leveraged buyout firms like TPG pool money from investors
to take over companies, financing their purchases mostly with
debt, with the intention of selling them later at a profit. The
firms are resuming acquisitions after the credit crisis brought
deal-making to a near halt in 2009. Firms have led $54 billion
of takeovers this year, more than double the amount in the same
period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Blackstone Group LP, KKR & Co. and other private-equity
firms are also taking advantage of record investor demand for
high-yield debt to refinance buyout-related loans and bonds as
the  Federal Reserve  holds benchmark  interest rates  near zero to
stimulate the economy. The wall of bonds and loans maturing
through 2014 has crumbled by 44 percent since 2009 to $671
billion according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “The wall of debt is turning out to be no wall of debt at
all,” Bonderman, 68, told the conference. “Debt markets are
very robust. The  bond market  is on fire.”  Yields on  junk bonds  have fallen from 7.85 percent at the
end of last year, reaching a record low 7.285 percent Feb. 22,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  Bonderman founded TPG 19 years ago with  Jim Coulter . Today,
the  Fort Worth , Texas-based firm manages about $48 billion of
investments. TPG’s deals include the $43.2 billion purchase of
Texas power producer TXU, now known as Energy Future Holdings
and the $27 billion takeover of casino company Harrah’s, now
known as Caesars Entertainment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
