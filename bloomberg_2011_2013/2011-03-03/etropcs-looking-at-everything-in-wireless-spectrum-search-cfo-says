  MetroPCS Communications Inc. (PCS) , the
pay-as-you-go mobile-phone carrier, said it is considering all
options in a search for additional wireless spectrum that would
help it expand more rapidly in the U.S.  “We’re looking at everything out there” on spectrum,
Chief Financial Officer J. Braxton Carter said on a conference
call today at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom
Conference in  San Francisco .  The Dallas-based carrier separately today said it was
seeking to expand its $1.6 billion credit agreement to include a
new $1.5 billion term loan. Carter said some of those funds
could help the company buy capacity for its network.  MetroPCS is willing to consider partnering with various
network operators to bring it more wireless capacity, including
billionaire Philip Falcone’s  LightSquared Inc. , said Carter.
Spectrum describes the airwaves that carry wireless signals.  MetroPCS rose 59 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $14.79 at 1:14
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
had gained 12 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
