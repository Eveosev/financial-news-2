  Croatia  has made “impressive
progress” in overhauling its judiciary and now needs “concrete
action” to improve its bid for membership in the European
Union, said Viviane Reding, the EU’s justice commissioner.  Croatian Prime Minister Jadranka Kosor, appearing with
Reding in Zagreb today at a press conference, said all targets
needed for EU accession are “reachable” and the government
will prepare a new “action framework” by March 7.  Croatia has “only one policy area” to solve, Reding said
later at a separate briefing.  All other policy chapters needed for discussion in
membership are coming to a close and the judiciary is the “only
area to solve,” Reding said.  Kosor said Croatia expects a “positive opinion” from the
EU Commission on the government’s sale plans for Croatia’s
shipyards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
