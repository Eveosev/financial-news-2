European stocks rose as better-than-
estimated earnings from  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV (ABI)  to  Adecco SA (ADEN) 
outweighed European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet’s
suggestions that the ECB may boost interest rates next month.  AB InBev, the brewer of Stella Artois and Bud Light, and
Adecco, the world’s largest supplier of temporary workers,
advanced more than 2 percent.  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) 
gained 3 percent after News Corp. won approval to take full
control of the company.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  led banks lower as
Trichet said “strong vigilance is warranted” and an “increase
of interest rates in the next meeting is possible.”  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.3 percent to
283.55 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, rebounding from two
days of losses. The gauge has climbed 2.8 percent this year amid
better-than-estimated corporate earnings and indications the
global economy is gathering strength.  The results season has showed “high profit margins and low
leverage,” Jan Loeys, the  New-York  based chief market
strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., wrote in a report today.
“The bullish force of a zero return on cash, combined with
fading medium-term uncertainties, remains in place and keeps us
significantly long equities to bonds.”  The Stoxx 600 pared an earlier gain of as much as 1.1
percent after Trichet’s remarks. The ECB kept its key interest
rate at a record low of 1 percent for a 23rd month today, as
predicted by all 53 economists in a Bloomberg survey, as part of
an effort to sooth the region’s fiscal woes.  ‘Should Be Worried’  “Trichet thinks it is not his mandate to solve this
crisis,” said Henrik Drusebjerg, a senior strategist at Nordea
Investment Management, which oversees about $76 billion in
Copenhagen. “He wants to put the responsibility on politicians,
where he thinks it belongs. The market was expecting Trichet
would keep interest rates low. You should be worried about banks
-- and southern European ones in particular.”  Santander,  Spain ’s largest bank, fell 1.7 percent to 8.50
euros.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ,  Italy ’s biggest, dropped 1.5 percent to
1.80 euros and  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES) , the largest publicly
traded lender in  Portugal , declined 0.8 percent to 3.22 euros.  National benchmark indexes gained in 13 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 1.5 percent,  Germany ’s DAX Index rose 0.6 percent and  France ’s CAC 40
advanced 0.7 percent.  Jobless Claims  European stocks were boosted by a U.S. report that showed
initial jobless claims unexpectedly fell last week to the lowest
level since May 2008. The data comes before tomorrow’s monthly
jobs report, which is forecast to say payrolls rose by 195,000
workers in February after a 36,000 gain the previous month.  The Stoxx 600 has declined 2.6 percent since peaking at a 2
1/2-year high on Feb. 17 as opponents of Libya’s ruler Muammar Qaddafi took over large parts of the country, sending the price
of oil soaring. Crude dropped for the first time in three days
in New York today after  Venezuela  offered to mediate a
resolution to the crisis.  AB InBev gained 2.3 percent to 41.11 euros. Fourth-quarter
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization,
excluding some items, were $3.9 billion, beating the median
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News for profit
of $3.4 billion.  Adecco advanced 5.4 percent to 65 Swiss francs after
reporting fourth-quarter net income of 141 million euros ($196
million). That exceeded the average analyst estimate of 115
million euros.  Earnings, Valuation  Fifty-six percent of Stoxx 600 companies that have
announced earnings since Jan. 10 have beaten the average analyst
estimate for per-share profit. The gauge is valued at about 13
times the reported earnings of its companies, close to the
cheapest since March 2009, when the measure reached its lowest
level in more than 12 years.  BSkyB climbed 3 percent to 823 pence, the highest price
since 2002. Rupert Murdoch’s  News Corp . won approval U.K.
government for its 7.8 billion-pound ($12.7 billion) bid to take
full control of the broadcaster after agreeing to spin off its
Sky News channel into a new public limited company.  Rival U.K. media companies declined.  Daily Mail  and General
Trust Plc, the publisher of the Daily Mail newspaper, slid 3.1
percent to 540 pence, the biggest drop since November.
Broadcaster  ITV Plc (ITV)  fell 3.1 percent to 90.55 pence.  Trinity
Mirror Plc (TNI) , which publishes the Daily Mirror, sank 22 percent to
66 pence even after full-year operating profit rose 17 percent.  Alcatel, Ericsson  Alcatel-Lucent led technology shares higher, surging 6.4
percent to 3.83 euros. There is speculation that an Chinese firm
may make a bid for France’s largest telecommunications equipment
maker, according to Jean-Michel Salvador, an analyst at
AlphaValue in Paris. Alcatel spokeswoman Alix Cavallari declined
to comment.  Ericsson AB, the world’s biggest maker of wireless phone
networks, rallied 3.5 percent to 81.3 kronor after UBS AG
upgraded its recommendation on the shares to “buy” from
“neutral.”    Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  advanced 3.9 percent to 1,466 pence after
saying its appraisal well in the Deepwater Tano licence off the
coast of  Ghana  has successfully encountered oil in excellent
quality sandstone reservoirs and confirming that the Owa-1
discovery is a “major light oil find.”  IMI jumped 6.6 percent to 943 pence. The world’s biggest
maker of pneumatic controls said full-year net income rose to
224.7 million pounds from 130.2 million pounds. The company said
its “optimistic” of making good progress in 2011.  Royal Ahold NV, the owner of Stop & Shop supermarkets,
dropped 2.7 percent to 9.44 euros as fourth-quarter profit
missed analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
