South African business confidence
fell to its lowest in four months in February, damping the
outlook for economic growth, the Chamber of Commerce and
Industry said.  The Business Confidence Index slipped to 86.4 last month
from 87.4 in January, the Johannesburg-based chamber said in an
e-mailed statement today. The index is compiled from 13 economic
indicators including retail sales, inflation and financial
gauges, such as the  stock index  and the currency.  “With the sub-indices on the  exchange rate  and the real
cost of financing being negative, the financial environment
appears to be leaning towards tighter financial conditions,”
the chamber said. A recovery in manufacturing and construction
is “failing to gather pace.”  Still, the economic outlook remains positive and last
month’s index remains above the one from a year ago, the chamber
said.  The political turmoil in North Africa and the rally in  oil
prices  may damp global economic growth, it said.  Crude oil gained 5.2 percent in February as the conflict
between Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  and rebels deteriorated in
the North Africa’s top oil producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
