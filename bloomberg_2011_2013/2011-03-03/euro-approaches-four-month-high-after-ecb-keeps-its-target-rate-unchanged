The euro climbed to almost four-
month highs versus the dollar and yen after European Central
Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the ECB may raise
interest rates next month to counter accelerating inflation.  “Strong vigilance is warranted,” Trichet told reporters
in  Frankfurt  after the central bank left its main refinancing
rate at 1 percent as predicted by all 53 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Swiss franc declined earlier as a
report showed the country’s retail sales slumped in January.  “The market is responding to Trichet’s comments
aggressively,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund
sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “He’s very
hawkish, no doubt about it. This is as close as he can go
without actually raising rates.”  The euro gained 0.6 percent to $1.3946 at 2:40 p.m. in  London , from $1.3866 yesterday in  New York . The shared currency
traded as high as $1.3974, matching the level on Nov. 9. It
gained 1.1 percent to 114.77 yen, from 113.52 yesterday, after
appreciating to 114.84 yen, the highest since Nov. 22. The
dollar strengthened 0.6 percent to 82.33 yen from 81.87
yesterday.  Rising oil prices, which surged over $100 a barrel last
week, and faster economic growth are fanning inflation which has
already breached the ECB’s 2 percent limit for three straight
months. At the same time, officials must weigh any rate increase
against the risk it will exacerbate Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis by tightening policy too soon.  Inflation Expectations  An “increase of  interest rates  in the next meeting is
possible,” Trichet said, adding that any increase would not
necessarily be the start of a “series” of moves.  Prior to today, the euro had gained 1.4 percent against its
U.S. counterpart since Feb. 21 when ECB Council member Yves Mersch said the central bank may raise its 2011 inflation
forecasts. Policy makers have kept the refinancing rate at 1
percent since May 2009.  Futures show traders added to bets for higher borrowing
costs in the region, with the implied yield on the three-month
Euribor contract expiring in December rising 18 basis points to
2.12 percent.  “This is obviously Trichet leading the euro, popping up
$1.3860 to north of $1.3920,” said C.J. Gavsie, managing
director for foreign exchange trading at Bank of Montreal in
Toronto. “This is a very strong reaction over concerns higher
interest rates in  Europe  going forward.”  Retail sales in the euro bloc rose 0.4 percent in January
after falling 0.6 percent the prior month, the European Union
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The median
prediction of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.3
percent gain.  Franc Weakens  The Swiss franc declined for a second day against the euro,
losing 1.4 percent to 1.2984. It was 0.8 percent weaker against
the dollar at 93.11 centimes.  Swiss retail sales declined 2.6 percent in January from a
year earlier when adjusted for inflation, after dropping 0.8
percent in the previous month, the Federal Statistics Office in
Neuchatel,  Switzerland , said today. That was the biggest decline
since March 2009.  The dollar slumped versus the euro even after a report
showed initial jobless claims in the U.S. unexpectedly declined
last week to the lowest level since May 2008.  Applications for  unemployment benefits  decreased by 20,000
to 368,000 in the week ended Feb. 26, Labor Department figures
showed. Economists forecast claims would climb to 395,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
total number of people receiving  unemployment insurance  fell to
the lowest level since October 2008.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against six currencies, fell 0.2 percent to
76.504, after touching the weakest since Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
