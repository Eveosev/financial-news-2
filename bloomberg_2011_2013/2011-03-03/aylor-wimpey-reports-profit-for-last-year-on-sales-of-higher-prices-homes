  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , the U.K.’s
second-largest homebuilder by volume, reported a 2010 profit
after the company sold its homes at higher prices.  Net income was 259.3 million pounds ($423 million) compared
with a loss of 640.4 million pounds a year earlier, the London-
based company said today in a statement. Revenue was little
changed at 2.6 billion pounds. The average selling price of its
homes rose 6.9 percent to 171,000 pounds, while home completions
fell 5.9 percent to 14,272.  Homebuilders have been focusing on acquiring cheap land and
selling fewer homes with higher margins on each sale. February
home prices unexpectedly rose 0.3 percent to 161,183 pounds from
January, a report by  Nationwide Building Society  showed this
week.  “We’ve seen good sales performance in all our outlets,”
Chief Executive Officer Peter Redfern said on a conference call
today. “We’ve seen solid sales rates, low cancellation rates,
good visitor levels and a small uptake in pricing.”  Earnings were helped by a 330.6 million pound net tax
credit. The company wrote down land and work in progress by 24.8
million pounds for 2010, compared with 527 million pounds for
the prior year.  Taylor Wimpey rose 2 pence, or 5.1 percent, to 41 pence in
London, the highest since April 29. The shares, which peaked at
about 394 pence in October 2007, have risen 30 percent this
year.  Spring Season  Home sales during the last two months have been
“slightly” better than the company expected, the CEO said. The
average selling price of Taylor Wimpey homes may climb as much
as 2 percent this year.  “Coming into the year we saw the range as being flat to
maybe down slightly,” Redfern said. “The balance has shifted
slightly positively.”  Housing transactions tend to increase during the spring
selling season and home sellers may be pricing properties more
aggressively, anticipating the rise in demand, Rightmove Plc
said in a Feb. 21 report.  Homebuilders are focusing on widening profit margins by
increasing the proportion of houses they build compared with
apartments and adding land for development after prices fell
following the financial crisis.  The operating margin, excluding finance costs, exceptional
items and amortization of brands, widened to 7.5 percent from
1.7 percent a year earlier and the company aims to increase the
figure to at least 10 percent by 2012. In 2007, the operating
margin was 11.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
