European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet was the best paid of the world’s top central
bankers in 2010, earning more than Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , Bank of England Governor  Mervyn King  and Bank of
Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa.  Trichet was paid 367,863 euros ($513,095) last year, 2
percent more than his 2009 salary, according to the ECB’s annual
accounts published today. Bernanke earned $199,700, while King,
who refused a raise in 2010, was paid 305,368 pounds ($497,078).  Trichet said today that the Frankfurt-based ECB may raise  interest rates  next month to combat inflation, which accelerated
to 2.4 percent last month. He also called for wage restraint.
The central bank aims to keep inflation just below 2 percent in
the 17-nation euro region.  Shirakawa’s salary, at 34.4 million yen ($420,281) for the
year ending March 31, fell 1.5 percent from a year earlier.
Remuneration for Japan’s central bank governor has declined 10.8
percent over the past 10 years as the country grappled with
deflation.  Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive  Norman Chan ’s
pay package may have outstripped Trichet’s. In 2009, he earned
HK$6 million ($770,218) plus HK$668,000 in benefits. Chan’s 2010
remuneration has yet to be published.  To contact the reporter on this story:
