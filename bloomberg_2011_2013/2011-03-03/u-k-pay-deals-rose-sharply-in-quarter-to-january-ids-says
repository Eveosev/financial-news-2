U.K. pay growth accelerated in the
three months through January, led by manufacturing, according to
 Incomes Data Services .  The median wage deal increased “sharply” to 2.8 percent
from 2.2 percent in the previous three-month period and 1.9
percent a year earlier, the London-based pay researcher said in
an e-mailed statement today. The figures exclude public-sector
workers.  IDS, whose data cover 52 deals for 244,935 workers, said
the median pay deal in manufacturing was 2.9 percent. Almost
half of the awards it surveyed were at least 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
