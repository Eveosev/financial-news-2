U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said global economies have enough crude oil reserves to
soften the blow of any sustained supply disruption.  “There is considerable spare oil production capacity
globally, and we and other major economies possess substantial
strategic reserves of oil,” Geithner said in testimony prepared
for a hearing today before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. “If necessary, those reserves could be mobilized to
help mitigate the effect of a severe, sustained supply
disruption.”  Oil in  New York  tumbled today the most in two weeks after
the  Arab League  said it’s holding discussions with Venezuela
about mediating the conflict in Libya.  “We are witnessing historic changes in North Africa, and
we are engaging with the economic authorities in the region and
with the multilateral development banks to address pressing
economic needs,” Geithner said.  The economy in the U.S. is “gathering momentum,” the risk
of rising inflation is “modest,” while unemployment remains
“unacceptably high,” Geithner said.  He also reiterated the Obama administration’s view that  China ’s currency “remains substantially undervalued.”  In a report to Congress on Feb. 5, the Treasury said China
had made “insufficient” progress in allowing the currency to
appreciate. U.S. lawmakers including Democratic Senator Charles
Schumer of New York complain that an undervalued yuan gives
China’s exporters an unfair advantage over American rivals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
