Mauritius plans to double its motor
gasoline storage capacity to 20,000 metric tons to counter a
threat to supply shipments from piracy, said Megh Pillay, the
chief executive officer of the State Trading Corp.  The country had faced a shortage this week due to increased
consumption and after a tanker took longer to arrive because it
was forced to change its route to the Indian Ocean island nation
to avoid pirates, Pillay told reporters today in  Port Louis , the
capital.  Motor gasoline stocks “which usually covers 10 days of the
country’s requirements, declined to less than a week,” he said.
“Our net mogas storage is 10,100 tons, which is not enough.”  Pirates seeking ransom hijacked a record 53 ships and 1,181
crew members last year, most of them off Somalia, according to
the London-based International Maritime Bureau. About 30 anti-
piracy ships are deployed daily in the region by groups
including the EU and North Atlantic Treaty Organization.  The plan to boost storage will be discussed at a cabinet
meeting tomorrow, Shawkutally Soodhun, the minister of trade and
industry, told reporters after meeting with petroleum companies
representatives today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
