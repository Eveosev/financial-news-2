demand for grains.  White corn for July delivery fell 44 rand, or 2.7 percent,
to 1,599 rand ($233) a metric ton on the  South African Futures

electronic trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, after

to 1,645 rand a ton on the exchange in  South Africa , where the

3,122 rand a ton.  The gains or losses for the most active contracts of the
