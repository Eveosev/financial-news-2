Egypt’s antiquities are in “grave
danger” from looters following the revolution that ousted
President Hosni Mubarak last month,  Zahi Hawass , Minister of
State for Antiquities Affairs, said in his  blog .  “When the revolution began on Jan. 25 and through its
first week, there were only a few reports of looting,” he said.
“However, since Mubarak’s resignation, looting has increased
all over the country and our antiquities are in grave danger
from criminals trying to take advantage of the current
situation.”  Four items out of 18 that were stolen from the Egyptian
Museum in Cairo on Jan. 28 have been recovered, Hawass said. The
statue of the Pharaoh Akhenaten as an offering bearer was
discovered by a protester near the southern wall of the museum
and his family contacted the ministry to have it returned, he
said.  Across  Egypt , storage magazines have been broken into
including that of the  Metropolitan Museum  of Art’s expedition in
Dahshur, which was attacked twice by looters who overpowered
guards and tied them up, Hawass said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
