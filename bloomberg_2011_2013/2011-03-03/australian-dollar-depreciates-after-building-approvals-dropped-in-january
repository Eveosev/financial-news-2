The Australian dollar weakened after
government reports showed that building approvals dropped by the
most since 2002 and the countryâ€™s trade surplus was wider than
economists had estimated.  The currency fell to $1.0155 as of 11:34 a.m. in Sydney
from $1.0164 before the data and $1.0169 yesterday in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
