Global food prices rose to a record
in February and grain costs may continue to rise in the next
several months, with only rice keeping the world from a repeat
of the crisis three years ago, the  United Nations  said.  An index of 55 food commodities rose 2.2 percent to 236
points from 230.7 in January, the eighth consecutive gain, the
UN’s  Food and Agriculture Organization  said today. Wheat rose as
much as 58 percent on the Chicago Board of Trade in the past 12
months, corn gained 87 percent and rice added 6.5 percent.  “I’ve never loved rice more than now,”  Abdolreza Abbassian , a senior economist at the FAO in  Rome , said by phone.
The grain is the staple food of more than half of the world
population, according to the International Rice Research
Institute. “Probably rice is the commodity which is separating
us from a food crisis,” Abbassian said.  Rising food costs contributed to riots across North Africa
and the Middle East in the last several months that toppled
leaders in Egypt and  Tunisia . Prices surged as bad weather
ruined crops from  Canada  to Australia and  Russia  banned grain
exports after its worst drought in a half-century.  $100-a-Barrel Oil  Turmoil in oil-producing countries including  Libya  has
pushed crude above $100 a barrel, which may drive corn and wheat
prices even higher, Abbassian said. Higher crude prices make
biofuels produced from crops more competitive while raising the
cost of tractor fuel and fertilizer for farmers.  “As long as  oil prices  remain high, it would start putting
heavy pressure on the market, first through corn and then
spilling over to other markets,” Abbassian said. “There’s no
sign of rationing for cereals. I don’t see a correction.”  Global food prices probably will rise in the first half of
this century because of an expanding population and higher
incomes, slower crop-yield growth and the effect of  climate
change ,  Ross Garnaut , the Australian government’s climate-change
adviser, said yesterday.  “The hike in food prices is deeply worrying,” Thierry
Kesteloot, a food-policy adviser at Oxford, England-based
hunger-relief charity  Oxfam , said in an e-mailed statement.
“Millions more people are sliding into poverty as they struggle
to afford basic food supplies, and more and more are at risk of
going hungry.”  Forced Into Poverty  Even without a crisis, the number of undernourished people
in the world will rise this year from 925 million in 2010 as
food costs gain, Abbassian said. He gave no estimate. The  World
Bank  said last month 44 million people have been forced into
extreme poverty since June by food inflation.  Food output will have to climb by 70 percent between 2010
and 2050 as the world population swells to 9 billion and rising
incomes boost meat and dairy consumption, the FAO forecasts.
Producing 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of pig meat can take 3.5
kilograms of feed, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  shows.  “You now need a very good 2011 crop, and if we don’t get
that, I’m not very optimistic about 2011-12,” Abbassian said.
“There hasn’t been a food crisis per se, anything comparable to
2008. With stocks being drawn down, for 2011-12 we’ll have to be
far more cautious.”  The UN’s food-price index rose 34 percent from 175.9 points
a year earlier, with all five food groups advancing.  Dairy Prices  The dairy index climbed to 230 points in February from
221.3 in January. Milk futures traded in  Chicago  jumped 15
percent last month following a 26 percent surge in January, the
biggest gain since March 2004.  The FAO’s sugar-price index slipped to 418.2 points from a
record 420.2 in the previous month. Raw-sugar prices climbed 37
percent in  New York  in the past year.  The gauge for meat rose to 169.5 points from 166.2. Meat is
a “significant” part of the diet in developed countries, which
may see more food inflation than in 2007-08, according to Ken Ash, trade and agriculture director at the OECD.  A gauge of cooking oils and fats gained to 279.3 points
from 277.7, the FAO said. Its cereal-price index climbed to
253.8 points from 244.8 in January, the highest level since July
2008, the report showed.  World grain production in 2010-11 is forecast to drop 1.1
percent to 2.24 billion metric tons, the UN agency said,
compared with December’s outlook for a 2.23 billion-ton crop. It
estimated cereal usage at 2.28 billion tons, exceeding
production.  Wheat Crop  The FAO cut its projection for ending stockpiles to 479
million tons from December’s 525 million tons following an
adjustment of historical Chinese corn inventories.  The global wheat harvest will come to 654 million tons,
compared with a previous outlook of 653 million tons, the FAO
said. Production of coarse grains including corn and barley will
be 1.12 billion tons, and milled-rice output will be 466 million
tons, it said.  Countries probably spent at least $1 trillion on food
imports in 2010, with the poorest paying as much as 20 percent
more than in 2009, the UN has said. Two-third of the world’s
hungry are “largely reliant” on rice as a staple, according to
Ash at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
