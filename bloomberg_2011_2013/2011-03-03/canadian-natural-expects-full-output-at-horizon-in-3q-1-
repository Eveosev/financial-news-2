  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the
nation’s second-largest energy company by market value, plans to
have its Horizon oil-sands project at “full plant production
rates” in the third quarter after a January fire halted output.  Production will increase to 110,000 barrels a day from
55,000 barrels a day in the second quarter, the Calgary-based
company said in a statement today. The Horizon plant, which
began separating bitumen from sandy deposits in 2009, averaged
daily output of 90,867 barrels last year.  The Jan. 6 fire at the Alberta plant halted production that
accounts for about 14 percent of Canadian Natural’s total
output. The company may spend as much as C$1.2 billion at the
site this year, according to the statement.  The company today reported a fourth-quarter loss of C$416
million, or 38 cents a share, compared with a profit of C$455
million, or 42 cents, in the year-earlier period.  The results include a C$1 billion loss from risk-management
costs, currency fluctuations and expenses at the company’s West
African offshore project, the company said. Fourth-quarter
revenue rose to C$3.79 billion from C$3.32 billion a year
earlier.  Canadian Natural fell C$1.76, or 3.5 percent, to C$47.97 at
4 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It was the largest decline
in seven weeks for the shares, which have gained 8.2 percent
this year.  Suncor Energy Inc. is the largest Canadian energy company
by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
