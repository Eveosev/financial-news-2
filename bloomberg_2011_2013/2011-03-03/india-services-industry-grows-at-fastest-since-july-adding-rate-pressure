  India ’s services industry grew
in February at the fastest pace in seven months, adding to
the case for the central bank to raise  interest rates .  The purchasing managers’ index rose to 60.2 from 58.1
in January, HSBC Holdings Plc and  Markit Economics  said in
an e-mail today. Data above 50 indicates expansion.  Growing consumer demand and higher oil prices threaten
to stoke inflation and may prompt the central bank to boost
rates in the March 17 monetary policy statement, said
Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank Ltd. Demand may
also strengthen after the government lowered income tax and
boosted spending in the budget this week.  “Demand looks strong,” Mumbai-based Rao said.   Oil
prices  are feeding into inflationary pressures along with
demand.”  By contrast,  China ’s non-manufacturing industries
contracted in February for the first time in a year because
of a weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.  The Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index
dropped to 44.1 from 56.4 in January, the China Federation
of Logistics and Purchasing said on its website today. A
separate PMI for services industries released by HSBC and
Markit Economics declined to 51.9 in February from 52 the
previous month, after adjusting for seasonality.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index fell 0.8
percent as of 10:55 a.m. in Mumbai. The yield on the 8.08
percent bond due August 2022, the government’s most-traded
debt, dropped one basis point to 8.09 percent. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. The market was closed
yesterday for a public holiday.  Monetary Tightening  The  Reserve Bank  of India on Jan. 25 raised the
benchmark repurchase rate for the seventh time in a year to
6.5 percent and signaled more tightening.  Mobile-phone operators including  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) 
added 13.72 million new customers in January, a 2.53
percent from the previous month, a sign of growing demand.
Loans extended by lenders, including ICICI Bank Ltd.,
gained 23.6 percent in the week to Feb. 11, the most in six
weeks.  Oil traded near the highest in 29 months as fighting
in  Libya  renewed concern that supply disruptions may spread
to the Middle East while an unexpected drop in U.S. crude
supplies signaled a recovery in demand.  Oil Prices  Crude for April delivery was at $102.29 a barrel, up 6
cents, or 0.1 percent, in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:13 p.m. in  Singapore . It
earlier gained as much as 71 cents to $102.94. Prices are
up 27 percent from a year ago.  Mukherjee on Feb. 28 unveiled plans to increase
spending by 13.4 percent to 12.6 trillion rupees ($279.6
billion) for the financial year starting April 1.  From next year, incomes below 180,000 rupees won’t be
taxed, higher than the previous threshold of 160,000 rupees,
the minister said. Mukherjee also announced a 1 percent
interest-rate subsidy for housing loans up to 1.5 million
rupees and said the government will give cash to the poor
to buy kerosene.  Even as he reduced the income-tax burden, Mukherjee
moved to boost levies in other areas that might contribute
to price pressures. The finance chief included more
services under the tax net to lift revenue. Taxes would now
be collected from air-conditioned restaurants, hotels,
airlines and hospitals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
