Russia’s services sector indicated a
continued failure to build growth momentum in 2011 despite
robust growth in manufacturing production, HSBC Holdings Plc
said.  The seasonally adjusted Business Activity Index fell to
53.4 in February from 54.2 in January, HSBC said in a report
today, citing data compiled by  Markit Economics . The survey-
based index indicates a contraction when it is below 50 and
growth with a figure above 50.  “Manufacturing grows faster while services expansion
remains weaker than its long-term trend,”  Alexander Morozov ,
chief economist at HSBC in Moscow, said in the statement.
“Modest growth of private consumption seems to be restraining
output growth in the services sector.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
