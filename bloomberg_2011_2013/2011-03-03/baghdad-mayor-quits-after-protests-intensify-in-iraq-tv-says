Baghdadâ€™s mayor became the third
official to submit his resignation this month following street
protests in the country to demand better  living conditions  and
anti-corruption measures, state television channel Iraqiya said.  Saber al-Issawi handed his resignation to Prime Minister
Nuri al-Maliki, the channel reported today. The governors of the
southern provinces of Basra and Babil also resigned earlier this
month.  Rallies across  Iraq  calling for more accountability from
elected leaders and better services have intensified since last
month amid a wave of unrest that has swept through the Middle
East, ousting the Tunisian and Egyptian presidents. Several
people have been killed in the protests across Iraq.  Maliki has urged his ministers to step up reform or face
the sack following the wave of unrest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
