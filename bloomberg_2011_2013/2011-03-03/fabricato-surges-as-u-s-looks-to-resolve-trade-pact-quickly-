  Textiles Fabricato Tejicondor SA (FABRI) , a
Colombian textile maker and exporter, rose to the highest level
in 32 months after the U.S. said it was working to approve a
trade agreement with  Colombia , according to a report.  Fabricato rose 8.3 percent to 35.2 pesos, the highest level
since June 2008, at 11:41 a.m. New York time. Fabricato
generates 17 percent of its revenue from exports, Bloomberg data
show.  The world’s biggest economy is working to move Colombia’s
trade pact agreement to Congress “as quickly as possible,” and
the lack of a pact “could leave U.S. exporters to these markets
at a competitive disadvantage,” according to the 2011 trade
agenda released on the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
