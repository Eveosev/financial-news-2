U.S. stocks rallied, giving
benchmark indexes their biggest advances in three months, as a
decrease in jobless claims and growth in  service industries 
bolstered confidence in the economic recovery.  DuPont Co. and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  advanced at least 2.8
percent, pacing gains in industrial companies. A gauge of
retailers in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.2 percent
as Retail Metrics said industry sales rose 4.3 percent in
February, topping analyst estimates.  Big Lots Inc. (BIG)  jumped 3.6
percent after reporting earnings that beat forecasts.  Valero
Energy Corp. (VLO)  rose 7.7 percent as the refiner projected a profit.  The S&P 500 added 1.7 percent to 1,330.97 at 4 p.m. in  New
York . The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  increased 191.40 points,
or 1.6 percent, to 12,258.20. Both gauges gained the most since
Dec. 1. Crude oil declined as  Venezuela  offered to mediate a
resolution to the Libyan crisis. The Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, which measures the cost of using
options as insurance against declines in the S&P 500, tumbled 10
percent, the most since November, to 18.60.  “It’s a relief rally,” said  Michael Nasto , senior trader
at U.S. Global Investors Inc., which manages about $3 billion in  San Antonio . “We got strong economic data across the board. Oil
is down, which is also a positive, reflecting what I like to
call a controlled chaos in the Middle East. Traders are happy
about the fact that the market has been hanging in there despite
all the recent turmoil.”  Corporate Earnings  The  S&P 500  has risen 5.8 percent this year as government
stimulus measures, improving profits and increased takeovers
bolstered confidence in equities. Per-share profit topped
analysts’ estimates at 71 percent of the 470 companies in the
gauge that have reported results since Jan. 10, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Earlier today, equity-index futures extended gains before
the open of exchanges as the Labor Department report said
applications for  unemployment benefits  fell by 20,000 to 368,000
in the week ended Feb. 26. Economists forecast claims would rise
to 395,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey. The total number of people receiving  unemployment
insurance  fell to the lowest level since October 2008.  A separate report today showed that the  Institute for
Supply Management ’s index of non-manufacturing businesses rose
to 59.7, the highest level since August 2005, from 59.4 in
January. Economists forecast the gauge would fall to 59.3,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. A
reading above 50 signals growth.  Consumer Confidence  U.S. consumer confidence last week held close to the
highest level in almost three years as more Americans said their
finances were in good shape. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
Index, formerly the ABC News U.S. Weekly Consumer Comfort Index,
was minus 39.3 in the period to Feb. 27, compared with minus
39.2 the prior week. Respondents’ view of their financial
situation climbed to an almost two-year high.  “All the economic data today was strong and pointed to a
self-sustaining U.S. recovery,” said  Richard Campagna , chief
executive officer of 300 North Capital LLC, which manages $500
million in  Pasadena ,  California . “You had two big picture
things that came out. There’s possibly less uncertainty in the
Middle East. At the same time, jobless claims dipped below
expectations. These things added together are driving everything
higher except the safe havens.”  ‘Pretty Good Environment’  Bridgewater Associates LP Chief Investment Officer Ray Dalio told financial-news channel CNBC that a “pretty good
environment” exists for some investments in U.S. equities.
Dalio said investors in U.S. stocks should consider
diversification in underrated assets, adding that 2011 “should
be a good year for equities, by and large.”  Shares of industrial companies, among the stocks most
dependent on economic growth, led the gains in the S&P 500,
rallying 2.4 percent as a group. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical
Index added 2.1 percent as 28 of its 30 stocks advanced.  The Dow Jones Transportation Average of 20 shipping,
airline, railroad and trucking companies increased 2.5 percent
as the drop in  oil prices  eased concern about rising fuel costs.  DuPont, the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker, rose 2.8
percent to $54.55. Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of
construction equipment, advanced 3.3 percent to $104.25.  The  S&P 500 Retailing Index (S5RETL)  gained 1.2 percent as same-
store sales in February surpassed analysts’ estimates, driven by
department stores as more confident shoppers embraced the
arrival of warm-weather goods.  18 Months  Same-store sales rose 4.3 percent last month, beating an
overall compilation of analysts’ estimates for a gain of 3.8
percent at the 27 chains tracked by Retail Metrics, based in
Swampscott,  Massachusetts . That marked the 18th straight monthly
gain from September 2009 and the fifth time in the past seven
months that sales have beaten projections.  Big Lots advanced 3.6 percent to $41.33. The Columbus,
Ohio-based discount retailer reported fourth-quarter profit of
$1.46 a share excluding some items. Analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg had estimated profit of $1.38 on average.  Valero climbed 7.7 percent, the biggest gain in the S&P
500, to $28.98. The independent U.S. refiner said it expects to
earn as much as 30 cents a share in the first quarter, after
recording a loss of $348 million on forward sales of refined
products. The company removed a “negative” by closing out the
positions, Credit Suisse Group AG said in a note.    Coventry Health Care Inc. (CVH)  advanced 5.7 percent to $32.30,
the highest price since September 2008. Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
raised its recommendation for the managed health-care company to
“buy” from “hold”.  Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. fell 5.6 percent, the
biggest decline in the S&P 500, to $26.78. The mobile-phone
maker was cut to “neutral” from “outperform” by Cowen & Co.,
which cited competition for the company’s XOOM tablet from Apple
Inc.’s iPad 2, being introduced next week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
