  Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , fell from the highest in eight weeks, data from a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, declined 4.1
percent to 19.4 million barrels in the seven days to March 2,
 International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement
today. Supplies were at 20.2 million barrels on Feb. 23, the
highest since the week ended Dec. 29.  Stockpiles of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, rose 7.5 percent to 14.5 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline decreased
4.4 percent to 9.7 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
