  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-
biggest U.S. bank, made $907 million in pretax profit from
deposits held at the bank by imprisoned Ponzi scheme operator
Bernard L. Madoff, a study said.  The Madoff firm’s balances in its JPMorgan account
generated the profit from 1986 to 2008, according to Linus Wilson, an assistant finance professor at the University of
Louisiana at Lafayette. Entitled “Madoff’s Dirty Money,” the
study posted on the Social Science Research Network on Feb. 27
uses “previously unanalyzed data” from the Securities Investor
Protection Corp., which handles the Madoff firm’s bankruptcy,
Wilson said.  The profit calculation was arrived at by assuming that the
Madoff deposits were reinvested in JPMorgan’s stock through Feb.
18, 2011, the study says.    Joseph Evangelisti , a spokesman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment.  JPMorgan was sued by the trustee liquidating Madoff’s firm
for $6.4 billion for allegedly aiding the con man’s fraud.
JPMorgan denied wrongdoing, saying the earnings from Madoff were
“wholly immaterial.”  JPMorgan’s fees totaled $597,000 in the six years before
Madoff’s 2008 bankruptcy, Picard calculated. JPMorgan earned
less than $3.5 million in interest by loaning $145 million to
Madoff’s firm in 2005 and 2006, the bank said.  According to court filings, Madoff’s accounts with JPMorgan
included  Treasury securities  as well as cash.  The JPMorgan case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 10-ap-
4932,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
