  BP Plc (BP/)  said  Apache Corp. (APA)  started
arbitration over the compliance of Canadian assets with local
environmental laws following a $7 billion transaction last year.  Apache Canada Ltd. began proceedings against BP Canada
Energy, London-based BP said today in its  annual report . Apache
alleges that some sites it acquired from the U.K. company in
July “will have to have work carried out” to ensure they meet
Alberta province regulations, BP said.  Apache “claims that the purchase price should be adjusted
for its estimated possible costs,” BP said, adding that it
denies the allegation. No hearing dates have been set.  BP last year agreed to sell oil and gas fields in the U.S.,
Canada and  Egypt  to Apache for $7 billion, raising cash to meet
the costs of the Gulf of Mexico spill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
