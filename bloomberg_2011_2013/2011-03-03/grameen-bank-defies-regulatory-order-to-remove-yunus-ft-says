Grameen Bank, a Bangladeshi
microfinance specialist founded by  Muhammad Yunus , is resisting
an order by Bangladesh Bank to remove Yunus from the managing
directorship, the Financial Times reported.  The central bank, which is also the country’s financial
regulator, said Yunus, 70, the 2006 Nobel peace prize winner and
a pioneer of microfinance, was relieved of his responsibilities
for non-compliance with its rules, the newspaper said.  Grameen said it had taken legal advice, in accordance with
which Yunus is continuing in office, the FT said.  The company said it’s followed all relevant laws, including
the process for reappointing Yunus, who has been managing
director since 1983 and was reappointed most recently in 2001,
the newspaper reported.  The government controls 25 percent of the voting members of
Grameen’s board and has appointed a chairman of the bank, which
takes deposits from the rural poor and has $955 million in
outstanding loans to 8.3 million borrowers, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
