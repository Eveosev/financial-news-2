European stocks rose as companies
from Anheuser-Busch InBev NV to Adecco SA reported earnings that
topped estimates, reassuring investors that rising profits can
push equities higher.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.4 percent to 283.97
at 8:02 a.m. in  London . The gauge has still declined 2.4 percent
since peaking at a 2 1/2-year high on Feb. 17 as opponents of  Libya â€™s ruler Muammar Qaddafi took over large parts of the
country, sending the price of oil soaring.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
