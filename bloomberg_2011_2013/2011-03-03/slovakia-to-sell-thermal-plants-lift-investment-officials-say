Slovakia plans to double foreign
direct investment this year and start the sale of stakes in
thermal  power plants  as it seeks to rein in the budget deficit,
government officials said.  The country is planning to at least double foreign direct
investment from last year’s 123 million euros ($171.4 million),
Robert Simoncic, chief executive officer at Slovak Investment
and Trade Developing Agency, said in an interview in  New York .  The government expects to approve a final decision on the
sale of stakes in six thermal power plants in the second
quarter, Economy Minister Juraj Miskov said. It may take between
six to nine months to complete the offering to strategic
investors, he said.  Slovakia, a country of 5 million people in central  Europe ,
is relying on foreign demand to boost economic growth after the
eastern euro-zone member slipped into recession in 2009.
The government posted a  budget deficit  of 17.7 million euros
($24.3 million) in January compared with a surplus of 22.8
million euros a year earlier, the  Finance Ministry  said Feb. 1.  The government wants to cut the budget deficit below the
European Union’s limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product by
2013 from an estimated 7.8 percent of GDP last year.  “There is always room to cut spending,” Miskov said. The
finance ministry will introduce new fiscal measures, mostly
aimed at spending cuts, in about a month, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
