  Bank of Japan  board member Tadao Noda said the central bank stands ready to take “appropriate”
policy action should risks to the nation’s recovery emerge.  “We are determined to implement flexible and appropriate
policies if the path for ending deflation becomes uncertain or
the outlook for the economy and prices changes dramatically,”
Noda said in a speech in Kumamoto, southern Japan, today.  Noda reiterated the central bank’s view that the economy is
recovering gradually after contracting in the fourth quarter.
He also said the U.S. is undergoing balance-sheet adjustments
and the world’s largest economy faces risks.  The  U.S. economy  “may be more prone to downward swings
rather than an upward rebound as these adjustments may take a
while,” he said.  Japan’s central bank has promised to keep the benchmark
overnight lending rate between zero percent and 0.1 percent
until it can anticipate an end to deflation, which has plagued
the economy for more than a decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
