Russian fuel oil exports from the
St. Petersburg oil terminal fell 10 percent in February from a
year earlier, a port official said.  Shipments dropped to 414,000 metric tons last month from
461,000 tons a year earlier, the official said by phone from St.
Petersburg today, declining to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Exports of the fuel, used by ships and power stations, are
down from 617,000 tons the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
