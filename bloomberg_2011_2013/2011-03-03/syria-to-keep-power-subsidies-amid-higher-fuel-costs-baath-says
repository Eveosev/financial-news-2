Loon Latakia, a fully owned
subsidiary of Calgary-based Kulczyk Oil Ventures Inc., continues
to explore for crude in  Syria , the official Syrian Arab News
Agency  reported .  Ammar Nofal, Loon Latakia’s general manager, described as
untrue other reports that the company had suspended work in the
country, according to the agency.  Kulczyk announced on Oct. 17 it had halted Syrian
operations due to an “increasingly more difficult operating
environment.” Loon Latakia holds a 50 percent stake in the
Block 9 concession in the northwestern region of Syria,
according to Kulczyk’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
