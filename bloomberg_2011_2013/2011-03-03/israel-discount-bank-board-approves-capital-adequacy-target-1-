  Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT) ’s board of
directors approved boosting its total capital adequacy ratio to
13 percent and Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio to 7.5 percent to 8
percent. The shares declined.  The country’s third-largest lender added that it may need
to deduct 850 million shekels ($235.4 million) in bad debt from
its capital funds following new Bank of Israel reporting rules
which will affect all Israeli banks. The bank’s Tier 1 capital
adequacy ratio in the third quarter was 7.4 percent.  “The plan will make it harder for the bank to grow,”
Yuval Ben-Zeev, an analyst at Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd., said
by telephone. “The targets are high in absolute terms and will
present a challenge for the bank,” Ben-Zeev said, adding that
investors expected the bad debt deduction to be between 600
million shekels and 700 million shekels.  Discount fell to the lowest level since August, declining
3.4 percent to 6.857 shekels as of 3:07 p.m. in  Tel Aviv .  While Discount will continue to provide loans to clients,
it will work to boost its business activity outside of the high-
risk loan area, with  capital market  initiatives such as pension
advisory, private banking, and  wealth management , a spokesman
said by telephone. The bank may also consider selling riskier
assets to boost its capital adequacy ratio, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
