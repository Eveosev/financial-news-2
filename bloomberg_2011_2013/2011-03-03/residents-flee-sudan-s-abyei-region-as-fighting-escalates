Civilians fled a town in a disputed
region between northern and  southern Sudan  as fighting escalated
in the area, Abyei area chief administrator Deng Arop Kuol said.  Armed men from the northern nomadic Misseriya tribe and
Sudanese army forces burned the village of Makier yesterday
after its residents fled, Kuol said today by phone from the
nearby town of Abyei.  Gunmen from the Misseriya moved south “then opened fire on
police,” he said. He wasn’t aware of whether there were any
casualties. Al-Sawarmi Khaled, a spokesman for  Sudan ’s army,
didn’t answer two calls made to his mobile phone.  Violence erupted in Abyei in January as oil-rich Southern
Sudan began a week-long referendum to decide on whether to
secede from the north. The voting in Abeyi was postponed because
of disputes over who is eligible to cast ballots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
