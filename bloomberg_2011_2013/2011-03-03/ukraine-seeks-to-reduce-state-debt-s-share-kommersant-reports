Ukraine seeks to shrink state debt
to 30 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 and 28 percent
in 2013 from 32 percent of GDP this year,  Kommersant-Ukraine 
reported, citing a government state debt strategy adopted
yesterday which the newspaper obtained.  The Cabinet also seeks to increase the share of domestic
debt from 43.4 percent of total state debts, or 141 billion
hryvnia ($17.74 billion), to 46 percent in 2012 and 48 percent
in 2013, according to the newspaper. The government seeks to
attract more investors by offering a wider range of bonds,
Kommersant said.  The number of fixed-income products will increase next year
from 69 percent to 73 percent and will reach 80 percent in 2013,
the Kiev-based newspaper cited the document as saying.    Finance Ministry  also plans to approve the annual state
bond auction calendar, according to Kommersant.  To contact the reporters on this story:
