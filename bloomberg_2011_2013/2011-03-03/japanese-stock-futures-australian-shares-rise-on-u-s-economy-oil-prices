Japan’s stock futures and Australian
shares rose after fewer Americans filed unemployment claims and  oil prices  eased for the first time in three days.  American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest carmaker, climbed 1.6 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo as the yen retreated. Those of Advantest
Corp., the No. 1 maker of memory-chip testers, gained 1.4
percent. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s biggest mining company,
advanced 1.5 percent in Sydney today.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in

10,710 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200
Index rose 0.3 percent today.  “The yen is weakening, oil prices have taken a breather
and you’ve got some better economic data,” said Juichi Wako, a
senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “There
should be some buying across the board.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.7 percent
yesterday in  New York , the biggest advance in three months,
after reports in the U.S. showed there were fewer jobless claims
and the service sector grew, bolstering confidence in the
economic recovery. Futures on the S&P were little changed today.  Fewer Jobless Claims  The U.S. Labor Department report said yesterday

benefits fell to the lowest level since October 2008.  In a separate report, the Institute for Supply Management’s

to counter accelerating inflation. Against the dollar, Japan’s
currency weakened to 82.52, a level not seen since Feb. 24, from
81.88. A weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at
Japanese companies when converted into their home currency.  Crude oil for April delivery dropped 0.3 percent to settle
