Indian banks need to boost
capital to help meet the funding requirements of an economy
that’s poised to accelerate, central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said.  “Because our growth is going to accelerate and
because credit demand is going to expand, the balance sheet
of the banks are going to expand,” Subbarao told a
conference organized by  Institute of International Finance 
in New Delhi today. “As balance sheets expand, Indian
banks will have to raise capital.”  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government aims to
quicken growth to more than 9 percent a year and sustain
that pace for more than two decades to reduce poverty. It
says spending on infrastructure including roads, ports and
power must double to $1 trillion in the five years through
2017 to support that targeted pace of expansion.    India ’s $1.3 trillion economy will probably grow 8.6
percent in the year ending March 31, the government
forecast last month.  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in his budget speech
on Feb. 28 announced the government will spend 60 billion
rupees in the fiscal year starting April 1 to recapitalize
state-run banks. It spent 201.57 billion rupees in the
current year on the lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
