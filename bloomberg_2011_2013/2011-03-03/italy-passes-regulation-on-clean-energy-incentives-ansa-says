The Italian Cabinet today passed a
decree that leaves clean energy incentives unchanged until June
when a further decree will introduce principles leading to a
gradual reduction, Ansa newswire reported, citing the text.  Starting in June, new legislation will be introduced
determining an annual limit to power for solar plants that seek
incentives. Future incentives will take into account the
declining costs of renewable energy plants, Ansa reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
