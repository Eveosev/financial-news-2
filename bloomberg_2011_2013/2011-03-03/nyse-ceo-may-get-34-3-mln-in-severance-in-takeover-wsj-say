  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  Chief Executive
Officer  Duncan Niederauer  would receive $34.3 million in
severance pay if he lost his job due to a hostile takeover, the
Wall Street Journal reported on its website, citing regulatory
filings.  Niederauer is set to become chief executive of the unnamed
combination of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse AG, the Journal
reported.  The payments reflect Niederauerâ€™s 2008 employment contract,
which remained unchanged, the Journal reported, citing the
regulatory filings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
