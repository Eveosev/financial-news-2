The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings decreased 3
basis points to 383, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 12:30
p.m. in  London . The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and a decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 0.5 basis point to 98.75. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers declined
3 to 148.5 and the subordinated index was 7.5 lower at 254.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
