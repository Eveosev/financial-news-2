The Super Bowl champion  Green Bay
Packers  released linebacker A.J. Hawk, a 2006 first-round draft
pick, for business reasons, General Manager Ted Thompson said.  Hawk would have earned $10 million in 2011, the  Associated
Press  reported.  The team yesterday also said it had released tight end
Donald Lee and safety Derrick Martin. Lee was slated to earn
$2.2 million next season and Martin was to be paid $750,000, AP
reported.  “With A.J., the business side of the game is driving this
decision,” Thompson said. “We’re hopeful that we can continue
to work with A.J. to have him be a part of our team in the
future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
