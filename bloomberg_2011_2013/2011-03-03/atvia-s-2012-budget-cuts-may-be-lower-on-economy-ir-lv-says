Latvia may have to find less than
half the savings in its 2012 budget than forecast to meet the
terms of its international loan as the economy recovers, Finance
Minister Andris Vilks said in an interview with  Ir.lv .  The government may need between 100 million lati ($196.6
million) and 150 million lati in changes to next year’s budget,
Vilks told the Riga-based magazine’s website, citing an improved
economy. That amount compares with an earlier estimate for
austerity measures of as much as 300 million lati, he said.  The budget savings may be made through higher real-estate
taxes, and reductions in subsidies for farmers. The final figure
would be affected by faster economic output, Vilks said,
according to Ir.lv.  The Baltic country plans to trim its  budget deficit  to
below 3 percent of gross domestic output next year so it can
adopt the euro in 2014. Latvia turned to a group led by the
European Commission and the  International Monetary Fund  for a
7.5 billion-euro ($10.4 billion) loan after its second-biggest
bank needed a state bailout in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
