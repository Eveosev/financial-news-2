Creditors of Independencia SA, a
Brazilian meatpacker operating under bankruptcy protection,
approved a plan to sell off some assets to pay debt.  The plan includes the sale of three plants, three plots of
land and two stores, according to a presentation today in  Sao
Paulo . Some 52 percent of creditors voted for the measure.  Independencia, which filed for bankruptcy protection in
February 2009 and halted production in October 2010, had sought
to sell meatpacking plants and assets in an “organized
liquidation,” Paiva said Feb. 15 after a previous rescue plan
was rejected by credits.  On Sept. 30, the company missed an interest payment on its
2015 senior notes. It was due to pay about $12 million on $165
million of its 15 percent bonds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  At the Feb. 15 meeting, Paiva said that a Brazilian  bankruptcy court  may order the liquidation should the plan to
sell assets be rejected. Paiva declined to comment when asked
about the next step today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
