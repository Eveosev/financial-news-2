Nizam Idris, a Singapore-based
currency strategist at UBS AG, the world’s second-largest
foreign-exchange trader, comments on the impact of inflation on  Indonesia ’s rupiah.  “We expect the rupiah to appreciate 4.5 percent next year,
but this year is a harder call. The risk with the rupiah is more
short-term rather than long-term, emanating primarily from
inflation and the way Bank Indonesia handles it. Once you’ve
passed the inflation issue toward the end of this year, then we
see clearer appreciation.  “Bank Indonesia could afford to be a bit more aggressive,
the market would like that. The point is the market dislikes a
wishy-washy approach toward handling inflation. When you lose
touch with inflation and then you have to catch up on hiking
rates aggressively, the risk of outflows from the equity and
bond markets will be massive.  “I’m neutral on the rupiah; unless there’s some weakness
and  Bank Indonesia  reacts with a hike, then that’s where you
would want to be opportunistic.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
