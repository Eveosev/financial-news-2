  Indonesia ’s rupiah strengthened,
touching a three-year high, on speculation the central bank will
tolerate gains in the currency to curb consumer-price increases.  Policy makers will hold off from adding to February’s
interest-rate rise after inflation slowed last month, according
to 10 of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Seven expect a 25-
basis point increase.  Bank Indonesia  will meet tomorrow to
review its policy rate. Southeast Asia’s largest economy will
allow the rupiah to appreciate to help keep imported inflation
in check, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said last week.  “The central bank is letting the currency appreciate to
control inflation,” said Bambang Eko Joewono, head of the
global-markets division at PT Bank UOB Buana in Jakarta. “I
don’t think  Bank Indonesia  will raise  interest rates  tomorrow.”  The rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 8,806 per dollar as of
4:36 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency earlier touched 8,798, the strongest level since
June 2007, which it also reached yesterday and on March 1.  The central bank unexpectedly raised its  reference rate  to
6.75 percent from a record-low 6.5 percent on Feb. 4. Inflation
eased to 6.84 percent last month from a year earlier, compared
with 7.02 percent in January.  Ten-year  government bonds  gained for a fourth day. The
yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell seven basis
points to 8.58 percent, according to closing prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
