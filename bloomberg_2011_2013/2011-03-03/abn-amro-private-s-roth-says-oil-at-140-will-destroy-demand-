  Daphne Roth , head of Asian equity
research at ABN Amro Private Banking, which oversees more than
$14 billion in the region, comments on oil prices and the
turmoil in Libya.  The Arab League is studying a plan proposed by Venezuelan
President  Hugo Chavez  to end the violence in Libya, Al Arabiya
TV reported, citing Secretary General Amr Moussa. Oil futures in  New York  slumped as much as 1.8 percent to $100.37 in after-
hours trading.  “If we can have a peaceful resolution on this issue, oil
prices coming down will definitely benefit sentiment. At the
moment, we’re dealing with a lot of uncertainty not knowing if
the unrest is going to spill over to the other nations.  ‘‘If prices are around $100 or $120 for Brent, the main
beneficiaries will be the exploration and production companies.
If  oil prices  shoot up to $140 or $160, that would definitely
destroy demand. I don’t think if the global recovery is derailed
it would be good for energy companies.”  For West Texas Intermediate crude, “between $70 to $90
would be a sweet spot for oil companies. That would mean
recovery remains on track and is boosting demand. Oil companies
can also take comfort and invest a lot more in capital
expenditure, and that will also help the sub-sectors within the
energy sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
