Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the world’s
biggest wind turbine maker, said it’s being investigated by
Italian authorities for allegedly defrauding the government of
342 million kroner ($63.5 million) in taxes.  The Randers, Denmark-based company hasn’t done anything
illegal, and the investigation results from a
“misunderstanding,” Peter Kruse, Vestas’ head of  investor
relations , said by phone today. At issue is Vestas’ handling of
turbine parts intended for export, he said.  “We are in dialogue with the authorities, and hopefully we
can sort out this misunderstanding,” Kruse said. “We believe
we have followed the rules and regulations.”  Borsen, a Copenhagen-based business newspaper, earlier
today reported that Vestas is under investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
