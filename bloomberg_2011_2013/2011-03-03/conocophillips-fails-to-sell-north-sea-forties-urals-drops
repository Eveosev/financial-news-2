ConocoPhillips failed to sell  North
Sea  Forties crude for a second day. Russian Urals fell after
Gunvor International BV reduced its offer.  North Sea  ConocoPhillips was unable to sell its cargo for loading
March 17 to March 19 even after it lowered the offer by 5 cents
to a discount of 20 cents to benchmark Dated Brent, according to
a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the daily Platts
trading window.  Four bids were made at 5 to 25 cents less than Dated Brent
without attracting any sellers. Bidders were BP Plc, Royal Dutch
Shell Plc, Vitol Group and Total SA, the survey showed.  Gunvor withdrew its earlier offer for Urals delivered to
Rotterdam March 18 to March 22 at $3.15 below Dated Brent.  Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
the Platts window that ends at 4:30 p.m. in London. Prior to the
window, Forties loading 10 to 21 days in the future cost 17
cents less than Dated Brent, compared with a 15-cent discount
the previous day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.    Brent crude  for April settlement traded at $114.96 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of
the window, down from $117.12 yesterday. The May contract was at
$114.90, 6 cents less expensive than April.  Mediterranean  Gunvor reduced its offer for 140,000 metric tons of Urals
for loading March 13 to March 17 by $1.15 from yesterday to
$3.30 below Dated Brent without finding any buyers, the survey
showed. Urals was valued at $2.13 less than Dated Brent in the
Mediterranean today, compared with a discount of $1.88
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  West Africa    Nigeria ’s Erha crude for April 6 to April 7 was sold at an
unknown price, according to traders involved in the transactions
of the region’s oil. Five of 13 Qua Iboe shipments are still
available and the remaining cargoes were sold, they said.    Chad  will export four 950,000-barrel cargoes of Doba crude
in April, one more than in March, and the Republic of Congo will
keep its Djeno exports for April unchanged at six 920,000-barrel
cargoes, loading schedules obtained by Bloomberg News show.  Indian Oil Corp. bought 2 million barrels of Bonny Light
from Morgan Stanley and 2 million barrels of Qua Iboe from
Waterway Petroleum, according to three people who participate in
the market.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc said maintenance of its Nigerian
deepwater Bonga oil and gas field, which accounts for about 10
percent of the country’s daily output, will last several weeks.  “We’re starting with a partial shutdown and then conclude
with a total shutdown,” Precious Okolobo, the company’s
spokesman in Lagos, said today in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
