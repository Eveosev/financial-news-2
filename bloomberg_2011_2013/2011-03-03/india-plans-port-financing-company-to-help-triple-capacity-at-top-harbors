India will form a state-owned
company to help raise funds for ports as it works on a ten-year
plan to triple capacity at its busiest harbors.  “We need a specialized arm,” Rakesh Srivastava, joint
secretary in the Ministry of Shipping, said in an interview in  New Delhi  today. “The ministry is not equipped to do the
fundraising job,” he said, without elaborating on when the
company would begin operations.  The new Maritime Finance Corp. will issue 50 billion rupees
($1.1 billion) of tax-free bonds in the fiscal year starting
April 1 to help pay for projects in 12 ports, Srivastava said.
The country,  Asia ’s third-biggest economy, plans to spend as
much as 2.87 trillion rupees on ports in the 10 years ending
2020 to support growth.  The port bonds were among the 300 billion rupees of tax-
free infrastructure bonds announced by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in his annual budget speech to parliament on Feb. 28.    India  plans to boost the annual capacity at major ports to
1.6 billion tons from 616 million tons by 2020, according to the
government’s  Maritime Agenda . Major ports are defined as those
with multiple berths.  To contact the reporter on this story:
