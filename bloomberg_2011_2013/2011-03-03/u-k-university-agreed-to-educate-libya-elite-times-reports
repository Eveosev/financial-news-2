The London School of Economics
negotiated a 1 million-pound ($1.6 million) agreement with Saif
al-Islam al-Qaddafi, the son of Libyan President  Muammar Qaddafi , to train hundreds of members of the north African
country’s future elite, the London-based Times reported, citing
unidentified people in the U.K. diplomatic service.  The extent of the LSE’s connections with the Qaddafi regime
emerges in diplomatic cables released by the Wikileaks website,
the newspaper said.  The university agreed to train 400 people in leadership and
management in Britain and another 250 in  Libya , for which it set
a charge of more than 1 million pounds, according to the Times.  On March 1, the LSE’s ruling council agreed on a plan to
distance itself from Libyan money, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
