     March 3 (Bloomberg) --  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said 146.8 million shares were sold for $6.35 billion
to redeem securities given to  American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
in the purchase of a non-U.S. business.  MetLife sold 68.6 million shares and AIG sold 78.2 million
for $43.25 apiece, the insurer said yesterday in a statement.
That compares with the $46.04 closing price for MetLife on March
1, the day the planned share sale was announced. MetLife said
proceeds will be used to repurchase and cancel convertible
preferred shares owned by New York-based AIG.  AIG also sold 40 million MetLife common equity units,
according to the statement. The transactions will help AIG repay
the U.S. Treasury Department, which holds a 92 percent stake in
the company. Under the deal struck last year, AIG had been
required to hold the securities for minimum periods of at least
nine months.  “This is a good thing for Met,” said Steven Labbe, an
analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC’s Langen McAlenney
division in Hartford,  Connecticut . “It eliminates what would
have become a nuisance for investors later this year as AIG
would have sold chunks in bits and pieces.”  MetLife advanced $1.84, or 4.2 percent, to $45.25 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading and has
climbed about 23 percent in the past year. AIG rose 21 cents to
$37.51.  “We appreciate MetLife’s agreement to permit the proposed
sales,” AIG Chairman  Steve Miller  said in a statement.  American Life  MetLife in November paid $16.2 billion to buy American Life
Insurance Co. from bailed-out AIG to expand in nations including
Japan and Poland. MetLife paid $7.2 billion in cash and $9
billion in securities including common stock, convertible
preferred shares and equity units.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  managed the common
stock transaction.  “We are optimistic about the prospects that taxpayers will
recover every dollar invested in AIG -- something that many
thought would be impossible when these investments were first
made,” Tim Massad, Treasury’s acting assistant secretary for
financial stability, said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
