Jordan’s  King Abdullah  appointed
Khaled al-Karaki, a former minister of education and deputy
prime minister, as his new royal court chief, replacing Nasser Lozi, the  state-run-Petra news agency  reported today.  Karaki previously served as chief of the royal court under
King Hussein of Jordan in the 1990s, father of the present
monarch. It’s customary for the king to change the royal court
chief whenever a new prime minister is appointed and a
government is formed.  Jordan’s King Abdullah swore in the government of Prime
Minister Marouf Bakhit, replacing that of Samir Rifai on Feb. 9
asking it to bring in immediate political and economic changes
without hesitation.  He was responding to protests by Islamist led opposition
groups that have been staged on Fridays since the revolt in  Tunisia  that forced President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali into exile
on Jan. 14. The unrest has also spread to  Egypt , where Hosni Mubarak stepped down as president after mass protests, and
Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and Algeria.  King Abdullah, who appoints the government, can dissolve
the legislature and rule by decree in its absence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
