  Centrica Plc (CNA) , Britain’s biggest
energy supplier, has put four gas-fed power stations in the U.K.
on “preservation mode,” halting some of the company’s least-
efficient plants for at least a year to cut costs.  Centrica posted so-called maximum-export limits showing
that no production is forecast from stations at Barry, Kings
Lynn, Peterborough and Brigg for the next 52 weeks, according to
data today on a  National Grid Plc (NG/)   website . The shutdowns take
1,231 megawatts of power capacity off line, or about 2 percent
U.K. demand for electricity.  “The power stations are in preservation mode to reduce
operation and maintenance costs,” Alan McLaughlin, a spokesman
for the Windsor, England-based utility, said by telephone.
“They’re in a state so they can be switched on when it’s
economical to do so.”  Centrica may require as many as two or three days to switch
the plants back on, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
