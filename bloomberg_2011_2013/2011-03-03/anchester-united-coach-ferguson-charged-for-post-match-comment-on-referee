Manchester United manager  Alex
Ferguson  was charged by the Football Association for comments he
made about the referee after a 2-1 loss to Chelsea earlier this
week.  Ferguson was charged with improper conduct after he
criticized official  Martin Atkinson  in post-match interviews
with Unitedâ€™s television channel. The referee gave a penalty
that allowed Chelsea to take the lead in the March 1 soccer
match.  The manager has until March 8 to respond to the charges,
the F.A. said today in a statement on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
