The $2.2 billion BlueGold Fund,
managed by Pierre Andurand, returned 7.5 percent last month,
said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  They declined to be identified because the information
isn’t public. Last month’s gain compared with an average of 0.7
percent across  hedge funds , as measured by the  HFRX Global Hedge
Fund Index  of Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.  The BlueGold Fund returned 12.8 percent last year, 55
percent in 2009 and 209 percent in its first year. It was
founded in February 2008 by London-based Andurand and Dennis Crema, 50.  BlueGold trades energy, metals, farm products and
currencies. Cotton surged to a record last month, leading
gainers on the Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index tracking 19
commodities. Copper advanced 1.4 percent on the  London  Metal
Exchange, immediate-delivery gold rose 5.9 percent and crude oil
traded in London climbed 11 percent.  Andurand, 34, started his career as an oil trader at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s J. Aron & Co. unit in  Singapore  in
2000. Crema spent 12 years at Vitol Group, where he was a senior
partner and head of trading, before founding BlueGold.  Hedge funds are private, largely unregulated pools of
capital whose managers can buy or sell any assets and
participate substantially in profits from money invested.  To contact the reporter on this story:
