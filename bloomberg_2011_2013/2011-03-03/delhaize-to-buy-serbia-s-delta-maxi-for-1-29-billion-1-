  Delhaize Group SA (DELB)  agreed to buy
Delta Maxi Group,  Serbia ’s largest food retailer, from Miroslav Miskovic’s Delta Holding for 932.5 million euros ($1.29 billion)
including debt to revive sales growth.  The transaction values the operator of 450 stores in
Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, Albania and  Bulgaria  at 10.4 times
to 11 times estimated 2011 earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization, Brussels-based Delhaize said
today in a statement. It plans to complete the purchase in the
third quarter and Delta will add to earnings immediately after.  Buying Delta will boost the Belgian food retailer’s annual
revenue in southeastern Europe about 70 percent to 3.4 billion
euros at a time Balkan nations seek deeper ties with the
European Union to hasten an economic recovery. Delhaize said
Delta Maxi’s markets will grow 5 percent to 7 percent a year in
the next four years, at least twice as fast as western  Europe .  “Much more emerging-markets exposure is what Delhaize
needed,” John David Roeg, an analyst at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam, wrote in a note today “We like the deal in spite of
the high Ebitda multiple.” Roeg has a “hold” rating on the
stock.  Delhaize fell as much as 1.7 percent on Euronext Brussels
and traded down 18 cents at 56.26 euros at 11:27 a.m. local
time. The shares have advanced 1.8 percent since the start of
the year, the fifth-best performance among the 25 companies
included in the Stoxx 600 Retail Index.  Focus on Sales  Delhaize made accelerating sales growth its top priority in
December 2009 as its U.S. business, which generates 70 percent
of revenue, has reported declining same-store sales for the past
two years.  It’s Delhaize’s biggest acquisition since the 2001 buyout
of its U.S. unit in an all-stock transaction valued at 2.25
billion euros excluding debt. Today’s purchase includes about
300 million euros of debt, net of cash acquired, as well as the
real estate of more than half of the 350 stores in Serbia and
seven distribution centers.  Delhaize will finance the purchase from cash holdings and
existing credit lines, Geert Verellen, head of  investor
relations , said by telephone. The Belgian grocer had 784 million
euros of cash and short-term investments on Sept. 30 and net
debt amounted to 1.82 billion euros, or 38 percent of
shareholder’s equity. The company reports fourth-quarter
earnings on March 10.  Investment in Serbia  It’s also the largest transaction in Serbia since Fornebu,
Norway-based Telenor ASA paid 1.51 billion euros for mobile-
phone operator Mobi 63 in 2006, the Balkan country’s biggest
state-owned asset sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Privatizations brought in about 860 million euros for all of
last year.  Belgrade-based Delta Holding is the largest private
employer in Serbia, with holdings in real estate, retail and
food distribution. Its annual sales equal about 9 percent of the
country’s gross domestic product.  In a February interview, Delta spokeswoman Jelena Krstovic
said the holding would sell half of its stake in Delta Maxi
Group to “relax borrowing needs.”  Delta owner Miskovic entered the Forbes list of
billionaires in 2007 and has been ranked among the wealthiest
people in eastern Europe, with an estimated wealth of $2.8
billion, according to research from Forbes and Polish magazine
Wprost.  Geographical ‘Fit’  “Delta Maxi is a perfect fit geographically between Greece
and  Romania  and in terms of strategy, with its multi-store
format,” Pascale Weber, an analyst at KBC Securities NV in
Brussels who recommends buying Delhaize shares, wrote in a note.
“The price tag might seem steep at first sight.”  Delhaize, which forecast annual cost savings of at least 16
million euros starting in 2014, said it’s paying about 0.68
times 2011 revenue, less than the average of 0.84 times of 23
transactions in southeastern Europe between 2006 and 2009,
according to a presentation posted on its website.  Lazard Ltd., Bank of America Corp. and Raiffeisen Bank
International AG advised Delhaize on the transaction. CMS acted
as legal adviser.  To contact the reporter on this story:
