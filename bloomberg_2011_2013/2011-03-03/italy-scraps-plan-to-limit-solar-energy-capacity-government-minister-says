  Italy ’s new government decree on
renewable energy has fixed no limit for solar plant incentives,
Environment Minister Stefania Prestigiacomo said.  Starting in June, Italy’s government will pass another
decree that will establish new targets for renewables with
tariff parameters and intermediate steps, she said in an e-
mailed statement today. The legislation will take into account
European Union laws on the matter, she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Jeffrey Donovan  at
