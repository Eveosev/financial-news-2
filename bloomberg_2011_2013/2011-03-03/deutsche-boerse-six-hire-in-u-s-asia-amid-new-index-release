Stoxx Ltd., the index provider owned
by  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  and Six Group AG, is hiring sales teams in
the U.S. and Asia as the company expands its coverage.  Stoxx is appointing staff in both regions, Chief Executive
Officer Hartmut Graf said in an interview today, declining to
give numbers. Stoxx said last month that it will introduce 1,200
new equity gauges to compete with rivals such as  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)   “We’re hiring teams in the U.S. and in Asia,” Graf said.
“We’re building up support and aspire to become a leading
provider in those regions.”  The company wants to further
expand its index business to other asset classes, he said.  Stoxx said it will offer regional and industry indexes
covering Europe, Asia Pacific,  North America , Latin America and
the so-called BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and China.  Deutsche Boerse, the operator of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, agreed to buy  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  for $9.53 billion in
shares last month. The merger will create the world’s largest
owner of equities and derivatives markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
