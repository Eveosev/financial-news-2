The cost of protecting bonds from
non-payment rose in  Australia  and was little changed in the rest
of Asia Pacific, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index added 1 basis point to
108.5 as of 11:58 a.m. in Sydney, according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan rose 0.5 basis point to 109.5 basis
points as of 8:22 a.m. in Singapore, Citigroup prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index lost 0.5 basis point to 102
as of 10:02 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup prices show. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
debt against default and traders use them to speculate on credit
quality. An increase suggests deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness and a drop shows improvement. The swaps pay the
buyer face value in exchange for the securities if a borrower
fails to meet its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
