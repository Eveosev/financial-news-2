  Grafton Group Plc (GN5)  expects profit to
improve this year, as a recovery in the U.K. housing market
helps to boost demand for building materials, the company said
in a statement distributed by the Regulatory News Service today.  U.K. like-for-like revenue rose 8 percent in the first two
months of the year, Executive Chairman Michael Chadwick said in
a telephone interview. The Dublin-based operator of home-
improvement stores said net income for 2010 rose more than
fourfold to 64 million euros ($88.8 million), from 13.4 million
euros the previous year.  “In the U.K., the market has started to recover from the
lows,” said Chadwick. “We would be optimistic that our Irish
merchanting and retailing businesses can stay profitable.”  Grafton’s sales rose 1 percent, to 2 billion euros, while
operating profit, before reorganization costs and amortization
and impairment charges, rose 93 percent to 50.6 million euros.  Grafton shares fell by 1.3 percent to 3.767 euros in Dublin
trading as of 8:23 a.m., valuing the company at 872 million
euros. Grafton generates more than 70 percent of its sales, and
almost all of its profit, from its U.K. business, according to
Chadwick.  The Irish housing market is probably more than 90 percent
below the peak and remains “very, very weak,” though it may
have “bottomed,” Chadwick said. A recovery may begin to emerge
in the next two to three years, he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
