The  United Nations  will seek to help
Lebanon define its maritime borders in the Mediterranean, where
Israel plans to drill for oil and gas, the UN representative in
Lebanon said.  The UN “is considering how best it can help Lebanon in
this area and especially with regard to the maritime border
between Lebanon and Israel,” Michael Williams said in an e-
mailed statement after meeting with Energy Minister  Gebran
Bassil  today. He said Lebanon should take steps to define
maritime borders with Cyprus and  Syria .  Lebanon has said that some of the gas deposits found off
Israel’s Mediterranean coast extend into Lebanese waters, and in
January it asked the UN to protect its territorial rights over
the resources. Israeli companies say they have located fields
that may contain 25 trillion cubic feet of gas, and the Israeli
government has said the finds are entirely in  Israel ’s waters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
