A Senate committee will hold a
hearing March 10 to examine  Bridgepoint Education Inc. (BPI) , part of
the for-profit college industry under federal scrutiny for its
recruiting practices and use of government funds.  The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee
will use Bridgepoint as a “case study,” Senator  Tom Harkin ,
the committee chairman and a Democrat from  Iowa , said in a
statement today.  Harkin wants the company, based in  San Diego , to explain
its $135 million increase in profit, as its loan default rates
rose and more than 60 percent of students who enrolled in the
bachelor’s program between 2008 and 2009 withdrew by the summer
of 2010, he said in the statement.  “Bridgepoint Education’s growth in both enrollment and
profits -- even as their rates of student withdrawals and loan
defaults climb -- exemplifies the issues in the for-profit
education industry,” Harkin said. “Using Bridgepoint as a case
study will help us better understand how the practices of for-
profit colleges impact their student’s chances for success.”  Andrew S. Clark, the company’s chief executive officer, has
been invited to testify, according to the statement. Bridgepoint
received correspondence from the committee on March 1 and is
reviewing the request, said Marianne Perez, a spokeswoman for
the company.  Bridgepoint fell 56 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $19.16 at 4
