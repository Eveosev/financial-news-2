AfrAsia Bank Ltd. , a closely held
Mauritian corporate lender, plans to expand its African loan
book by more than threefold in the next 18 months, Chief
Executive Officer James Benoit said.  The bank will seek to invest in medium-sized companies
focused on infrastructure and commodities and listed on
Johannesburg’s stock exchange, Benoit said in a March 1
interview in  Port Louis , Mauritius’s capital. The company
currently has three offices in  South Africa .  “Our loan book in  Africa  stands at $30 million,” he said.
“We expect it to reach $100 million in 2012. We aim to reach
this goal through financing South African entities, with
capitalization of some $100 million, which are expanding in
their country and in the region.”  AfrAsia Bank started operating in 2007 and had assets of 14
billion rupees ($480 million) at end-February, according to
Benoit. It also hold investments in Asia and plans to sell
shares, probably on Mauritius’s stock exchange, within five
years.  “In reaching the $100 million mark, we will match the
loans book that we have in  Asia ,” Benoit said. “We are seizing
opportunities as Mauritius positions itself as a financial hub
in the Indian Ocean, as a link for investments from Asia to
Africa and from the latter to other countries of the
continent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
