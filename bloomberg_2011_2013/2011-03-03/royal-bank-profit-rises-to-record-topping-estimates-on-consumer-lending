  Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  reported record
first-quarter profit, topping analysts’ estimates for the first
time in six quarters, on higher  consumer lending  and investment-
banking fees.  Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 rose 23 percent to
C$1.84 billion ($1.89 billion), or C$1.24 a share, from C$1.5
billion, or C$1, a year earlier, the Toronto-based bank said
today in a statement. Revenue rose to C$7.4 billion from C$7.33
billion a year earlier.  Royal Bank is the sixth Canadian bank to beat estimates
this quarter, joining lenders including Toronto-Dominion Bank,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and  National Bank of Canada ,
after the country’s economy grew more than economists forecast
in the fourth quarter. Capital markets revenue also lifted
earnings on higher stock and bond sales.  “The markets have been active, money’s flowing into
financial assets,” Tony Demarin, chief investment officer of
BCV Asset Management, said in an interview before earnings.
“RBC remains the leader in that area.”  Excluding one-time items,  Canada ’s biggest bank said it
earned C$1.26 a share, beating the C$1.01 a share average
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Royal Bank rose 38 cents to C$56.94 yesterday on the
Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has risen 9 percent this year,
compared with a 7 percent gain for the 10-company  Standard &
Poor’s /TSX Banks Index.  Dividend Unchanged  The bank kept its dividend unchanged at 50 cents, the 14th
consecutive quarter without an increase. Royal Bank set aside
C$334 million for bad loans, down from C$493 million a year
earlier.  Canadian consumer banking earnings rose 14 percent to a
record C$882 million on volume growth and lower loan-loss
provisions, the bank said.  International banking, which includes Raleigh, North
Carolina-based RBC Bank, had earnings of C$24 million for its
first profit in 11 quarters. Royal Bank has spent almost two
years reorganizing RBC Bank as Canadian rivals Bank of Montreal
and Toronto-Dominion Bank expand by buying troubled U.S.
lenders.  Earnings from the RBC Capital Markets investment-banking
unit rose 7.4 percent to C$613 million from a year earlier.  Trading revenue was C$1 billion, compared with a C$1.04
billion a year earlier.  Wealth management, which includes mutual funds sales, rose
1 percent to C$221 million from a year earlier. Insurance rose
23 percent to C$145 million.  Bank of Nova Scotia, the third-biggest bank, reports
results on March 8.  (Royal Bank will hold a conference call to discuss first-
quarter results at 7:30 a.m. Toronto time. Dial +1-866-696-5910
