  Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) , an arm of  China ’s biggest state-owned investment company, said 2010 profit
gained 50 percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as its specialty
steel business grew and it sold stakes in non-core assets.  Net income was HK$8.92 billion ($1.4 billion), or HK$2.44 a
share, compared with HK$5.95 billion, or HK$1.63 a share, a year
ago, the Hong Kong-listed company said in an exchange filing
today. That beat the HK$6.74 billion mean estimate of seven
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Chairman Chang Zhenming sold assets, including a cargo
handler and a power supplier, to focus on  iron ore , steel and
property after the company was bailed out for losses incurred on
currency bets in 2008. Profit from its two specialty steel units
climbed 49 percent to HK$2.1 billion, according to the statement.  Citic Pacific gained as much as 4.1 percent to HK$21.6
today in  Hong Kong , trading at HK$21.55 by the 12:30 p.m. local
time break. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose 1 percent.  Sales rose to HK$70.6 billion from HK$46.4 billion. The
company proposed a final dividend of 30 Hong Kong cents a share,
taking full-year dividends to 45 cents.  The company aims to reach annual steel production capacity
of 9 million metric tons, including steel bars, specialty plates
and seamless steel tubes, this year, the statement said, without
giving a comparison.  Citic Pacific, building a 28 million-metric-ton iron ore
project in  Australia ’s Pilbara region, said Jan. 19 exports from
the project will begin in the “latter” part of the year, a
delay from a previous plan. The mine has suffered from a cost
overrun, with the company in May saying building costs jumped by
$835 million.  --Helen Yuan and Marco Lui. Editors Alan Soughley, Andrew Hobbs  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
