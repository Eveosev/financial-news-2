  Vietnam ’s dong rose on speculation a
government order for companies to sell their dollars back to
banks will help narrow the gap between the official and
unofficial exchange rates caused by a shortage of the greenback.  The dong gained 0.04 percent to 20,865 per dollar as of
3:09 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In the so-called black market, the currency traded between
21,580 and 21,670 at gold shops in  Ho Chi Minh City , compared
with between 21,450 and 21,640 yesterday, according to an
information service run by state-owned Vietnam Posts &
Telecommunications.  Central bank Governor Nguyen Van Giau told reporters in
Hanoi on March 1 that state-owned companies were told to part
with excess holdings of the U.S. currency. The order helped ease
pressure on the dong to drop because less local currency needs
to be sold in exchange for the dollar.  “It’s reaction to the news that the government and  State
Bank  of Vietnam will at some stage make state-owned companies
sell dollars into the banking system, so that will increase the
supply of U.S. dollars,” said Pham Phuong Lan, Hanoi-based head
of the fixed-income and currency trading desk at Bank for
Investment & Development of Vietnam.  The highest dong deposit rates on offer at commercial banks
were 14 percent for the period from Feb. 19 to Feb. 25, while
maximum dollar deposit rates were offered at 6 percent,
according to a statement yesterday on the central bank’s website.  The State Bank of Vietnam set the daily  reference rate 
higher at 20,658, compared with 20,663 yesterday, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  The yield on the benchmark five-year bond fell two basis
points to 11.53 percent in Hanoi according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  -  Nicholas Heath . Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the reporter on this story:
