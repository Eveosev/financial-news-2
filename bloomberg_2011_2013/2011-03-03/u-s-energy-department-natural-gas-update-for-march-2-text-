Following is the text of the weekly
natural gas update as released by the U.S. Department of Energy
in Washington D.C.:  Natural gas prices showed continued relative weakness during the
report week. The spot price at the Henry Hub fell from $3.83 per
million Btu (MMBtu) on February 23 to $3.79 per MMBtu on March
2.  At the  New York Mercantile Exchange  (NYMEX), the March 2011
futures contract expired at $3.793 per MMBtu, having declined
about 12 percent during its tenure as the near-month contract.  Working natural gas in storage fell to 1,745 Bcf as of Friday,
February 25, according to EIA’s Weekly Natural Gas Storage
Report.  The spot price of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil
contract increased 6 percent on the week, from $96.04 per barrel
(or $16.56 per MMBtu) to $102.27 per barrel (or $17.63 per
MMBtu). Wednesday was the first time since September 30, 2008,
that the WTI price has gone over $100 per barrel.  The number of natural gas rigs, as reported February 25 by Baker
Hughes Incorporated, rose by 1 to 906.  Prices  At most trading locations, prices declined moderately over the
week. At the  Henry Hub , the spot price fell 4 cents from $3.83
per MMBtu to $3.79 per MMBtu. Declines in the Rocky Mountains
were somewhat more pronounced than other price decreases in the
country, with most prices in the area falling by 10 cents or
more. The Northwest Sumas trading point posted a decline of 44
cents.  In the Northeast United States, price changes were mixed. A few
trading locations posted declines (at the Iroquois Waddington
pricing point, the spot price declined on the week from $11.24
per MMBtu to $9.88 per MMBtu), but most prices increased, some
by more than a dollar per MMBtu. Northeast prices currently
range from below $4 per MMBtu to above $10 per MMBtu. At
Transcontinental Pipeline’s Zone 6 trading point for delivery
into  New York  City, prices fell on the week by 42 cents, from
$8.38 on February 23 to $7.96 on March 2. At the Algonquin
Citygate, on the other hand, prices rose $1.49 per MMBtu from
$8.80 to $10.29 per MMBtu. Average temperatures in the Northeast
varied across the area, from the 40s in parts of  Pennsylvania  to
the 20s in upstate New York and areas of  New England .  Natural gas consumption increased, according to estimates from
BENTEK Energy Services, LLC. Total consumption, according to
BENTEK estimates, increased 5 percent from the previous week.
Residential and commercial consumption made up the bulk of the
increase, rising 6 percent from the previous week. Consumption
of natural gas for electric power generation rose 13 percent,
while industrial consumption fell slightly from last week.
Consumption in the residential and commercial sectors likely was
bolstered by cold temperatures in the Northeast  United States .  Natural gas supply showed no change from week to week, as
weakness in imports offset strength in production.* On Monday,
February 28, daily production was 63.1 billion cubic feet (Bcf),
the highest number BENTEK has on record in the 6 years for which
it has daily data. Total production for the week was slightly
higher than last week, and 6 percent greater than the same week
last year. Imports from  Canada  declined by 1 percent this week,
and were 17 percent lower than their level last year. LNG
imports continued to show weakness, falling 14 percent from
their levels last week.    Oil prices  have risen over the past several weeks, while natural  gas prices  have remained relatively unchanged. The ratio of oil
to natural gas prices (dollars per barrel of oil to dollars per
MMBtu of natural gas) has risen to historically high levels. On
February 24, the ratio of the Brent and WTI crude oil prices to
the Henry Hub natural gas price was 29.7 and 25.0, respectively.
Over 2010, the ratio of the Brent and WTI crude oil prices to
the Henry Hub price averaged 18.7 and 18.6.  Spot Prices  At the NYMEX, the price of the April 2011 natural gas contract
fell slightly. The April 2011 contract (which moved into the
near-month position on Friday, February 25) fell about 12 cents
from $3.936 per MMBtu last Thursday to $3.818 yesterday. The
March contract expired at $3.793 per MMBtu, having fallen about
12 percent during its time as the near-month contract. The value
of the 12-month strip (the average of the 12 contracts between
April 2011 and March 2012) fell from $4.34 per MMBtu last
Wednesday to $4.25 yesterday.

Storage  Working natural gas in storage fell to 1,745 Bcf as of Friday,
February 25, according to EIA’s WNGSR (see Storage Figure
<storagefig.html>). The 85 Bcf draw was much smaller than the 5-
year average draw for the week of 131 Bcf and last year’s draw
of 124 Bcf. Stocks were 9 Bcf below last year’s level and 15 Bcf
below the 5-year average of 1,760 Bcf.  In the Producing Region, working gas in storage increased by 9
Bcf. This was the first net injection during the month of
February in the Producing Region since the week ending February
13, 2009, when stocks in the Producing Region increased by 13
Bcf. Working inventories in the region have only increased a
handful of times in the month of February for the 17 years for
which EIA has data.  Temperatures in the lower 48 States during the week ending
February 17 were warmer than normal and also warmer than last
year. The  National Weather Service ’s degree-day data show that
the temperature in the lower 48 States last week averaged 40.3
degrees, 1.7 degrees warmer than the normal temperature and 3.3
degrees warmer than last year. Every region of the country was
warmer than normal except the New England, Mountain, and Pacific
census divisions, which were colder than normal. Heating degree-
days nationwide were about 5 percent below average, and 10
percent below last year.  More Storage Data:

EIA released the “Natural Gas Monthly”
< http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/natural_gas/data_publications/na 
tural_gas_monthly/ngm.html>, which includes data through
December 2010. This is EIA’s first set of historical natural gas
data for all of 2010, although data are not considered final
until the Natural Gas Annual is released. In December 2010,
marketed production of natural gas hit its highest recorded
December level, at 63.8 Bcf per day. Production rose only
slightly from its November level of 63.6 Bcf per day, but was
considerably higher than the December 2009 level of 58.1 Bcf per
day. The natural gas wellhead price rose to $4.07 per MMBtu from
its November level of $3.43 per MMBtu, an increase of almost 19
percent. However, compared to previous Decembers, the 2010
December price level was relatively low. Total natural gas
consumption rose this December to 87.9 Bcf per day, a 38 percent
increase from November levels. Heating degree-days in December
were greater than normal. Consumption rose in all of the major
consuming areas (residential, commercial, industrial, and
electric power), but residential and commercial consumption
(driven primarily by heating degree-days) made up the bulk of
the increase from November to December.  Major Energy Producers’ Net Income Falls in 2009. On February
25, EIA released “Performance Profiles of Major Energy Producers
2009”
< http://www.eia.gov/finance/performanceprofiles/pdf/020609.pdf >,
a publication reviewing financial and operating data for major
oil and natural gas producers and petroleum refiners. Among the
report’s major findings:  Net income of companies that reported fell by 66 percent from
$88 billion in 2008 to $30 billion in 2009, the result of
declining energy prices. Net income in 2009 was at its lowest
level since 2002.  The reporting companies earned a 5-percent return on
stockholder’s equity (ROE) in 2009, 4 percentage points below
the average ROE of the Census Bureau’s All Manufacturing
Companies.  Oil and gas production were the most profitable segment of the
surveyed companies. The refining and marketing segment fared the
worst, reporting a $7 billion net loss for 2009.  Both cash flow and capital expenditures declined substantially
in 2009, and upstream expenditures fell year-over-year but
remained at historically high levels.  Oil and gas production and reserves both increased; and finding
and lifting costs declined.  Refining/marketing capital expenditures declined but still
remained high in 2009, and U.S. refinery capacity for surveyed
companies increased by 2 percent. Surveyed companies made up 78
percent of U.S. refining capacity in 2009. For this year’s
report, 30 major energy companies reported their financial and
operating data to EIA. The number of companies reporting
increased by 3 from 2008, to include Alon USA, Chalmette
Refining LLC, and Western Refining, Inc.  Natural Gas Transportation Update  On March 1, Daughin Island Gathering Partners issued a critical
notice initially stating that Tri-States NGL Pipeline, operated
by BP Pipeline, experienced a rupture and has been shut in “for
undeterminable time”. All gas plants delivering product to Tri-
States have been given notice to shut in. Because most of
Daughin Island Gathering Partners production is processed at the
DCP Mobile Bay Processing plant, they are required to shut in
all offshore production with the exception of VK 826 gathered
gas which has been rerouted. According to BENTEK Energy, because
of these shut-ins gas receipts onto Destin pipeline in offshore  Mississippi  went to zero March 1 from close to 540 MMcf per day
on Feb. 28, as Destin has to interrupt operations to all
offshore platforms.  Subsequently, Daughin Island Gathering Partners clarified the
reasons for Tri-States Pipeline’s shut-in stating that it is due
to an inspection following “unauthorized vehicle activity by a
third party” within the pipeline’s right-of-way near Kiln, MS.
They are exercising “an abundance of caution” and there is no
indication of a leak.  On Thursday, February 24, El Paso reported that the start date
of its Ruby Pipeline has been delayed, with service now expected
to start in July. The pipeline has been delayed twice by weather
and permitting issues. In January, El Paso reported that the
start date was expected to be in June. Ruby pipeline was
designed to transport production from the  Rocky Mountains  to
West Coast markets. The initial design capacity of Ruby Pipeline
is 1.5 Bcf per day, and will run 680 miles from the Opal Hub in  Wyoming  and terminate at interconnects near Malin,  Oregon .  On February 28, Florida Gas Transmission began pipe maintenance
on the East White Lake Lateral (immediately upstream of Station
75), with work expected to continue until the end of March.
Florida Gas Transmission will schedule 150,000 MMBtu per day
from their East White Lake South Group, 300,000 MMBtu per day
lower than their normally scheduled volume. Florida Gas
Transmission is also performing other maintenance projects for
the month of March: maintenance on the mainlines upstream of
Station 9, impacting throughput by 200,000 MMBtu per day;
pipeline and compressor station maintenance/upgrades between
Stations 11 and 15, reducing scheduled volumes by 350,000 MMBtu
per day; pipeline and compressor station maintenance/upgrades
between Stations 24 and 27, reducing scheduled volumes by
200,000 MMBtu per day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
