Grain loadings for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub,
more than doubled in the week through yesterday, boosted by
wheat shipments to North African countries including  Morocco .  Outgoing grain cargoes amounted to 194,199 metric tons
between Feb. 17 and Feb. 23, the Seine River port said in an e-
mailed statement, up from 94,868 tons a week earlier.  Shipments included 170,089 tons of wheat and 24,110 tons
of barley, the most in three weeks for both grains. Morocco was
the biggest export destination with 81,039 tons of wheat and
6,360 tons of barley, followed by  Algeria  with 78,150 tons of
wheat loaded.    France ’s other main grain ports are La Pallice in the Bay
of Biscay and Dunkirk on the North Sea coast.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
