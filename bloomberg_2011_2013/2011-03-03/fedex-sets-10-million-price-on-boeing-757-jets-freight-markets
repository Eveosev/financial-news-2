  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  is propping up the value
of used  Boeing Co. (BA)  757 jets by buying the twin-engine planes to
replace some of its oldest, least-efficient freighters.  The operator of the world’s largest cargo airline will add
18 more 757s by May 2012 to the 48 it has now. FedEx probably
pays about $10 million each, a couple of million dollars more
than an owner might get in a sale to a passenger carrier, said
Douglas Runte, managing director at Piper Jaffray & Co.  “It’s providing a floor underneath the value of 757s,”
said Runte, who is based in  New York . He estimates that FedEx
spends about $5 million each to refit the planes to carry cargo.  Acquiring secondhand jets gives  Memphis , Tennessee-based
FedEx a class of planes that can carry 20 percent more freight
while burning a third less fuel than the company’s three-engine
Boeing 727s. A comparable new medium-range aircraft from Boeing
would cost as much as five times more.  “With the 727s, you practically carry more fuel than
packages,” said Kevin Sterling, an analyst at BB&T Capital
Markets in Richmond, Virginia. “That’s not good. The 757 is a
great way to refresh their fleet.”  Sellers include International Consolidated Airlines Group
SA’s British Airways, Saudi Arabian Airlines and U.K. charter
carrier Thomson Airways Ltd., according to Ascend Online Fleets.
By purchasing 757s with engines either from Rolls-Royce Group
Plc or  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s  Pratt & Whitney , FedEx buoys
the values of all models of the jet, Piper Jaffray’s Runte said.  Reliable Buyer  Some carriers are agreeing on sales to FedEx three years
before they intend to hand over their 757s, locking in prices
with a buyer they view as more reliable than many of the smaller
airlines that usually purchase secondhand aircraft, Runte said.  Jess Bunn, a spokesman, declined to discuss FedEx’s fleet
plans, citing the approach of the company’s fiscal third-quarter
report on March 17. FedEx’s  684 planes  range from single-engine
Cessnas to wide-body Boeing 777 freighters that list for $269.1
million and can fly nonstop between the U.S. and  China .  FedEx began bringing in the 757s in 2007 to phase out its
727s, echoing a shift already under way at  United Parcel Service
Inc. (UPS) , which got rid of the last of its 727s by the end of 2008,
according to regulatory filings. UPS has 75 of the 757s, a total
that has been unchanged since at least 2000, filings show.  FedEx has 77 of the 727s, which average 32 years of age and
need a three-member crew -- pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer
-- instead of the two people on more-modern jets. Adding urgency
to the fleet transition is a doubling in the price of  jet fuel 
in the past two years, to $3.26 a gallon today.  Maintenance Drag  The trade-off in adding 757s is a jump in FedEx’s spending
to configure them for cargo, which helped push up maintenance
and repair expenses by 22 percent to $990 million for the six
months ended Nov. 30. That pulled profit lower than analysts
projected for the quarter through November.  “We expect revenue growth to be partially offset by cost
increases associated with higher aircraft maintenance” and
bigger pension outlays in the fiscal year ending in May, Chief
Financial Officer Alan Graf told investors on a Dec. 16 call.  FedEx shares have climbed 4.2 percent in the past 12
months, trailing the 24 percent increase for Atlanta-based UPS,
the world’s largest package-delivery company, and the 19 percent
gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  “Near-term maintenance is spiking, but they’re going to
have a maintenance holiday soon,” said BB&T’s Sterling, who
recommends buying the shares. “It’s the right strategy.”    Retirement Age   Secondhand sales of narrow-body jets totaled 931 last year,
according to data from Ascend. Based on average market values,
the total was $5.64 billion, according to the data.  The planes FedEx is buying are about 20 years old on
average, a typical retirement age for a  passenger jet  because
that’s when interiors wear out and heavy maintenance checks are
needed. They have a maximum operational revenue payload of
45,800 pounds (20,775 kilograms), compared with 38,200 pounds
for a 727, according to a FedEx regulatory filing.  FedEx operates its 757s chiefly on U.S. routes, taking
advantage of demand for shipments of pharmaceuticals,
electronics and financial documents as the economy recovers.  Boeing  stopped making 757s in 2005 . With the 727 out of
production since 1984, the planemaker’s only new narrow-body
model is the smaller 737, which lists for as much as $85.9
million.  ‘Especially Popular’  “The 757 model is especially popular due to its large
payload capacity and conversely lower effective operating
cost,” said  Lim Serh Ghee , chief operating officer of Singapore
Technologies Aerospace Ltd., which has a contract valued at $470
million to modify 87 jets for FedEx through 2014.  A freighter conversion takes about 100 days, with any heavy
maintenance or engine overhauls done at the same time, according
to  Singapore Technologies .  The makeovers include ripping out seats, overhead luggage
bins, lavatories and galleys, then installing a larger door,
reinforcing the shell and floors, and adding rollers to assist
with the handling of cargo containers, Lim said in an e-mail.  Singapore Technologies,  Asia ’s biggest plane-maintenance
specialist, has delivered 32 converted 757s to FedEx, with eight
more in the works now, Lim said. The list price for such work is
$4.8 million to $5.5 million, Lim said.  “We are of the view that there is sustained potential in
the 757 market,” Lim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
