A Chinese sailor was shot in the leg
while resisting arrest by  South Korea ’s coast guard for
allegedly fishing illegally in waters off the west coast, the
 Dong-A Ilbo  newspaper reported.  Crewmembers on two Chinese fishing boats wielded hammers,
axes and wooden sticks while resisting arrest yesterday, the
Korean-language newspaper said, citing a South Korean coast
guard official it didn’t identify. A Korean official was hurt by
the Chinese, prompting the coast guard to open fire, the
newspaper said.  The injured Chinese received medical treatment and the
injury isn’t life-threatening, Dong-A said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
