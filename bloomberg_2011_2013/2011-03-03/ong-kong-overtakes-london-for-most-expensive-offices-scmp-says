  Hong Kong ’s office rents became the
world’s most expensive last year, overtaking  London ’s West End,
the  South China Morning Post  said, citing real estate consulting
company DTZ Holdings Plc.   Rents will continue to rise in Hong Kong because of strong
demand and short supply, pushing the occupancy cost of each
workstation up by $9,190 to $31,520 by 2015, the Hong Kong-based
English-language newspaper reported today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
