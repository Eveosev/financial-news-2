European Central Bank Governing
Council member Yves Mersch said the central bank will exert
“strong vigilance” on inflation, suggesting he supports an
interest-rate increase as early as next month.  “ Once the genie of inflation is out of the bottle it
might be too late. In order to avoid these effects, we will
exert strong vigilance,” Mersch said in  Frankfurt  today after
ECB policy makers set the benchmark lending rate at a record low
of 1 percent for a 23rd month.  ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet today said the central
bank may raise  interest rates  next month to fight accelerating
inflation pressures. Rising oil prices, which surged over $100 a
barrel last week, and faster economic growth are fanning annual
price gains that have already breached the ECB’s 2 percent limit
for three straight months.  At the same time, officials must weigh their inflation
concerns against the risk of exacerbating  Europe ’s sovereign
debt crisis by tightening policy too soon.  To contact the reporters on this story:
