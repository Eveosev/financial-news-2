General Atlantic LLC agreed to buy a
stake in Facebook Inc., valuing the social-networking company at
about $65 billion dollars, CNBC’s David Faber reported, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The purchase of 2.5 million shares from former Facebook
employees must be approved by Facebook and amounts to one-tenth
of 1 percent of the company, Faber said. Jonathan Thaw, a
Facebook spokesman, declined to comment, as did Adam Weiner, a
spokesman for General Atlantic.  Facebook, owner of the world’s most popular social-
networking site, said in January it raised $1.5 billion in a
financing round led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That transaction
valued the company at $50 billion, the  Palo Alto , California-
based company said at the time.  Facebook said that offering was oversubscribed and it chose
to raise less than the $2 billion it could have. The Goldman-led
funding was limited to non-U.S. investors amid concern that
selling to those in the U.S. would violate rules limiting the
marketing of private securities.  General Atlantic, founded in 1980, has $17 billion in
capital under management. The firm’s Internet and media
investments include luxury goods seller Gilt Groupe Inc. and
software company Kaspersky Lab.  To contact the reporter on this story:
