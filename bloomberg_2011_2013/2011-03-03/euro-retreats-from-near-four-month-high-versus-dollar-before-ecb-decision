The euro declined against the
dollar, falling from its strongest level in almost four months,
before the  European Central Bank  announces a decision on  interest rates .  The 17-nation currency weakened against 11 of its 16 major
peers tracked by Bloomberg. ECB policy makers will leave their
main refinancing rate unchanged at a record low of 1 percent,
according to all 53 economists in a Bloomberg survey, while
central bank President Jean-Claude Trichet may indicate future
policy at a press conference that follows the decision. The
franc erased a decline against the euro after Swiss central bank
Vice Chairman Thomas Jordan said there is no need for
intervention at the moment.  The euro traded at $1.3846 as of 9:47 a.m. in London from
$1.3866 in  New York  yesterday, when it reached $1.3891, the
strongest since Nov. 9.  Europe â€™s common currency traded at
113.30 yen from 113.52 yen. The franc was little changed at
1.2810 per euro. The dollar bought 81.81 yen from 81.87
yesterday.  The ECB, which aims to keep annual gains in consumer prices
to just below 2 percent, will publish inflation projections for
2011 and 2012 today after its monthly policy meeting.  To contact the reporters on this story:
