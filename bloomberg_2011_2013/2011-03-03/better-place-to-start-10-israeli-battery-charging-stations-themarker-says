Better Place LLC, a U.S. start-up,
is seeking to open as many as 10 commercial battery charging
stations in order to serve electric cars on Israeli roads,
 TheMarker  said.  The company, which is partly held by Israel Corp., expects
to add about 50 stations by 2016, the newspaper reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
