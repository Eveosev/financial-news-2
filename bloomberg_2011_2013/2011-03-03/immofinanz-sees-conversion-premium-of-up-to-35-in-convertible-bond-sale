  Immofinanz AG (IIA) , an Austrian real
estate group, is offering most of its 550 million euros ($767
million) of convertible bonds to outside investors after
shareholders picked up only 3 percent of the issue.  The bonds, due to price today, convert into as many as
121.2 million shares, the Vienna-based company said in a
statement. The notes due 2018 are expected to have a conversion
premium of 30 percent to 35 percent on today’s average share
price, and a coupon of 3.5 percent to 4.25 percent, it said.  Immofinanz will use the funds raised in the sale to buy
back outstanding convertible bonds due 2014 and 2017, which
investors can demand to be redeemed by next year. Bondholders
have until March 7 to tender those securities.  Immofinanz shareholders had two weeks to subscribe to the
bonds before yesterday’s deadline. They subscribed to bonds
convertible into 3.8 million shares out of a total of as much as
125 million shares, Immofinanz said. Institutional investors are
being offered the balance today.  A successful refinancing will complete Immofinanz’s
restructuring following a cash squeeze in 2009. Chief Executive
Officer Eduard Zehetner has merged eastern European unit
Immoeast AG, put expansion plans on hold, settled disputes with
former affiliates and sold assets to restore cash reserves.
Dividend payments, suspended since 2008, will be resumed if the
refinancing succeeds, he said on Feb. 15.  Immofinanz shares declined 0.7 percent at 3.103 euros at
the 5:30 p.m. close of Vienna trading, falling for a third day.  The company will use mainly stock it already holds, or
treasury shares, if the bonds are converted, avoiding a dilution
of common shares. A maximum of 21 million shares, or 2 percent
of the outstanding stock, could be issued if all bonds are
converted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
