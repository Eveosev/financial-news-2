Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
has shown “very positive” signals about her commitment to curb
spending since taking office in January, said Patrick Esteruelas, an analyst at Moody’s Investors Service, at an event
in  New York .  Rousseff’s decision to maintain the  minimum wage  “within
very reasonable” levels amid pressure to raise it further was
“perhaps the most important signal,” Esteruelas said during
the event sponsored by the American Associations of Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela.  In a legislative victory for Rousseff, 63, Brazil’s Senate
and lower house of congress last month voted to raise the
monthly minimum wage 6.8 percent to 545 reais ($330) for this
year, rejecting proposals to lift it to a higher amount.
Rousseff said on Feb. 28 her government could set the rate in
2012 at about 616 reais ($373) a month, based on inflation and
economic growth forecasts.  “It’s imperative to us that this government send strong
signals that it’s going to rein in much of the fiscal excesses”
of 2010, the last year of the administration of her predecessor
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Esteruelas said. “The signals are
certainly positive, and could bring  Brazil  back to a sustainable
position,” he said.  Moody’s expects “probably before the summer” to determine
whether or not to upgrade Brazilian debt, currently rated Baa3,
the lowest investment grade level, Esteruelas said. Moody’s has
Brazil, Colombia and  Bolivia  on a “positive outlook,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
