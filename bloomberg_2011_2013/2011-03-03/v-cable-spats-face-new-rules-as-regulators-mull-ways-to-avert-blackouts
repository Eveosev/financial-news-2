U.S. regulators proposed changing
rules for broadcast-cable fee disputes such as the fight that
blocked Fox’s World Series baseball games last year from New
York-area subscribers of  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)   The suggested regulations advanced today by the Federal
Communications Commission on a 5-0 vote. The rules face a
comment period and another vote, for which no date has been set,
before becoming final.  The FCC at its meeting today also was to vote on proposed
changes to a $1.3 billion program within the Universal Service
Fund that pays for telephone service for poor people. The low-
income program has grown 58 percent since 2008, driven by
payments to America Movil SAB’s TracFone unit, which gives free
mobile phones to participants.  -0- Mar/03/2011 19:52 GMT  -0- Mar/03/2011 19:53 GMT  To contact the reporter on this story:  Todd Shields  in Washington at
