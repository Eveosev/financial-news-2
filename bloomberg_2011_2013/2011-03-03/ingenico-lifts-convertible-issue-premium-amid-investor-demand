  Ingenico (ING)  SA, the biggest maker of
point-of-sale terminals, raised the conversion premium on 250
million euros ($348 million) of convertible bonds amid investor
demand for the debt.  The price the bonds due 2017 can be handed over for stock
will be set at 35 percent to 40 percent above today’s market
price, up from an earlier range of 30 percent to 35 percent, the
Neuilly-sur-Seine, France-based company said in a statement. The
coupon will be 2.75 percent to 3.50 percent.  “This shows just how starved of paper the convertible  bond
market  is,” said Paul Glynn, managing director of equity-linked
trading at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London. “Some
parts of the market have got very expensive.”  Sales of convertibles are dwindling as first-quarter
issuance in the U.S., the biggest market for equity-linked debt,
runs at about a third of levels prior to the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. The shrinking supply has driven
yields on the debt to near the four-year lows reached on Feb.
17, the BarCap U.S. Convertibles Composite Index shows.  Ingenico’s deal is being managed by Lazard-Natixis, Societe
Generale SA and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which are selling an
initial 220 million euros of the notes and have an option to buy
another 30 million euros, according to the statement.  The company plans to use the sale proceeds for possible
acquisitions, according to the statement.  Ingenico spokesman Remi Calvet declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
