Rice prices rose to records in
January in  Indonesia , the world’s fourth-most-populous nation,
prompting the government to suspend the import duty on the
grain, the  United Nations  said.  National prices averaged 9,244 rupiah ($1.01) a kilogram
(2.2 pounds), up 23 percent from a year earlier, the UN’s Food
and Agriculture Organization  said  in a report on its website
today. Indonesia’s government has been “actively buying” rice
on world markets, the FAO said.  Prices remained at record highs last month in Bangladesh,
the largest South Asian rice buyer, reflecting reduced
inventories, according to the report.  The grain is the staple food for more than half of the
world population, according to the International Rice Research
Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
