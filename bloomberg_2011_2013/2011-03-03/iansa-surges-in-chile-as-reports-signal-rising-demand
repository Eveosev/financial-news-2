  Empresas Iansa SA (IANSA) , Chile’s largest
sugar producer, rose the most in almost five months after the  United Nations  said food prices climbed to a record and reports
signaled the global economy is improving.  Iansa climbed 7.4 percent to 63.82 pesos at 2:59 p.m. New
York time in Santiago trading, the steepest increase since Oct.
13. Chile’s Ipsa index rose 2.2 percent.  Today’s UN report “is pushing up all food related
stocks,” said Rodrigo Mujica, an analyst at the brokerage unit
of Banco de Credito & Inversiones. “Global equities are also
strongly up and Iansa is a very volatile stock.”  An index of 55 food commodities rose 2.2 percent in
February, the eighth consecutive monthly gain. U.S. stocks
climbed today, sending the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  up the
most in three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
