Copper rose to a two-week high as
concerns eased that metal demand will dwindle amid a decline in
energy costs and more signs of a U.S. economic recovery.  Crude-oil futures dropped as the  Arab League  weighed a
proposal from Venezuela’s  Hugo Chavez  to mediate the conflict
in Libya. Initial jobless claims unexpectedly declined last
week to the lowest level since May 2008, indicating a
strengthening labor market in the U.S., the world’s second-
biggest copper consumer. The price of the metal rose to a
record last month.  “The market will also be watching the Libyan situation
closely with Chavez entering the fray,” said  Daniel Brebner ,
an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in  London . “It may moderate
risk perceptions” in the near term, he said.  Copper for delivery in three months climbed $25, or 0.3
percent, to close at $9,915 a metric ton ($4.50 a pound) on the
London Metal Exchange at 6:11 p.m. local time. Earlier, the
price reached $$9,979, the highest for a most active since Feb.
16.  The metal has gained 31 percent in the past year, as
mining companies struggled to keep pace with rising
consumption.  China  is the largest copper buyer. The price
touched a record $10,190 on Feb. 15.  “Growth will be good enough to support prices,” said
Rich Ilczyszyn, a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker
in Chicago. “Fundamentals are positive, and the uptrend in
copper is still intact.”  In New York, copper futures for May delivery slid 0.8
cent, or 0.2 percent, to settle at $4.49 a pound on the Comex.
Earlier, the price reached $4.5485, the highest for a most-
active contract since Feb. 16. The all-time high was $4.6575 on
Feb. 15.  Futures may reach $4.64 by the end of next week, Ilczyszyn
said.  Aluminum, lead, tin, zinc and nickel also gained on the
LME.  To contact the reporters on this story:
