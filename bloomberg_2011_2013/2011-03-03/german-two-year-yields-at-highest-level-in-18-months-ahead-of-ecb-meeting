German two-year government notes
plunged, pushing the yield up to the highest in more than two
years, as European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
said  interest rates  may be increased at the next meeting.  Ten-year yields also surged as Trichet told reporters in  Frankfurt  that inflation risks have moved to the “upside.” An
“increase of interest rates in the next meeting is possible,”
he said after the central bank left its key rate at a record low
of 1 percent.  “The short end is getting clobbered as market expectations
of a June rate hike get cemented,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a
fixed-income strategist in Edinburgh at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd., a broker for banks and investors. “The ECB is clearly
setting the ground for a rate hike.”  Two-year yields jumped 23 basis points to 1.77 percent as
of 4:34 p.m. in London, after reaching 1.78 percent, the most
since January 2009. The 1.5 percent security due March 2013 lost
0.455, or 4.55 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,385) face amount, to
99.46. The yield on the 10-year bund rose 13 basis points to
3.33 percent.  Forward contracts on the euro overnight index average, or
Eonia, show investors are betting the  European Central Bank  will
raise its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points at its July
meeting, according to Deutsche Bank AG data. Trichet’s comments
changed the gauge, which had shown investor expectations of an
autumn rise.  Three-month Euribor futures dropped, pushing the implied
yield on the contract expiring in December 24 basis points
higher to 2.185 percent, as traders added to bets that the ECB
will boost borrowing costs. It was 1.33 percent at the end of
2010.  ‘Strong Vigilance’  “Strong vigilance is warranted,” Trichet said, adding
that any increase would not necessarily be the start of a
“series” of moves.  Rising oil prices, which surged over $100 a barrel last
week, and faster economic growth are fanning inflation that has
already breached the ECB’s 2 percent limit for three straight
months. Consumer prices in the 17-country euro-region increased
an annual 2.4 percent in February, up from 2.3 percent a month
earlier.  The yield difference, or spread, between German two-year
notes and U.S. securities of a similar maturity widened 17 basis
points to 103 basis points, the most since January 2009.  Inflation Outlook  Trichet announced the ECB’s quarterly economic forecasts,
which showed officials raised the lower band of their growth
predictions for this year and next, and increased their outlook
for inflation. Consumer prices will rise in a range of 2 to 2.6
percent in 2011, up from a December forecast of between 1.3 to
2.3 percent, he said.  The spread between the German 2-year and 10-year
securities, the so-called yield curve, narrowed 10 basis points
to 155 basis points.  Ten-year Spanish yields rose seven basis points to 5.4
percent. The nation sold 3.8 billion euros ($5.3 billion) of
debt maturing in 2014 and 2016.  France  sold 8.9 billion euros of
securities due in 2017, 2018, 2020 and 2026.  Demand rose and borrowing costs fell at a sale of Spanish
five-year notes. Investors demanded 2.17 times the securities
offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.1 at a previous
sale in January, the nation’s debt management office said today.  Spanish Auction  The notes were sold at an average yield of 4.389 percent,
down from 4.542 percent at the earlier sale.  “From the size and cover perspective it was not too bad,
even though they didn’t allocate it at the upper end of the
range,” said Norbert Aul, an interest-rates strategist at Royal
Bank of Canada in  London . “It was definitely better than the
last auction, but this one has been on an easier curve
segment.”  Greek two-year note yields climbed 10 basis points to 14.91
percent after reaching 15.03 percent, the highest since May 10,
the first trading day after the European Union and the
international Monetary Fund announced the creation of a bailout
fund to backstop the euro.  Portuguese 10-year yields rose six basis points to 7.52
percent, while similar-maturity Italian yields were 10 basis
points higher at 4.9 percent, and Irish 10-year yields climbed
two basis points to 9.41 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors a loss of 1.4
percent this year, compared with 0.3 percent for U.S.
Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
debt returned 1.8 percent, while French securities lost 1.2
percent, the indexes showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
