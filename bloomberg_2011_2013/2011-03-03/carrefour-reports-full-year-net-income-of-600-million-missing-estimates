  Carrefour SA (CA)  reported annual profit
that trailed analysts’ estimates and Chief Executive Officer
Lars Olofsson pledged to inject “new momentum” into the
retailer by accelerating store openings in 2011.  Net income rose to 433 million euros ($600.5 million) from
a restated 276 million euros, the Paris-based grocer said today
in a statement. The average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for profit of 695.5 million euros.  Carrefour, which booked one-time costs of 1.14 billion
euros, cut its profit forecast in November because of writedowns
at its Brazilian unit and lower-than-expected demand in  Europe .
The grocer plans to spin off its Dia discount chain and 25
percent of its real-estate unit, a move it says will enable it
to focus on developing the Carrefour brand and unlock value for
investors. The company today predicted growth in both sales and
current operating income this year.  “In 2011, we will inject new momentum,” Olofsson said in
the statement.  Excluding Dia, Carrefour forecast cost savings of 480
million euros in 2011, purchasing gains of 225 million euros and
two-day inventory reduction. The grocer said it will accelerate
retail expansion this year, opening 800 stores, notably in
growth markets.  Dia shares will be listed on the Madrid stock exchange
after the separation, while the property unit will be listed in
Paris, Carrefour said March 1. Carrefour has predicted higher
sales and profit through 2015 as it invests 1.5 billion euros to
revive its superstore format in western Europe.  Carrefour’s annual activity contribution, a measure of
operating profit, was 2.97 billion euros in 2010, the company
said Jan. 13.  Carrefour dropped 3.9 percent in Paris trading yesterday,
paring its gain this year to 8.9 percent.  The retailer plans to propose a dividend of 1.08 euros a
share, the same as 2009’s payout, payable on July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Roberts  in Paris at
