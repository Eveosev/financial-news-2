A group of victims of Bernard L.
Madoff’s Ponzi scheme told an appeals court that the trustee
liquidating the con man’s former firm is using the wrong formula
to determine who stands to recover part of their investments.  The trustee,  Irving Picard , shouldn’t use the difference
between what an individual put into Madoff’s firm and the amount
withdrawn to calculate the loss, a lawyer for investors began
arguing today to judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals in New
York. The investors want losses based on what their account
statements from the firm showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
