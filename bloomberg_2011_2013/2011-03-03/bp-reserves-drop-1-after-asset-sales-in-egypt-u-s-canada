  BP Plc (BP/)  said its proved recoverable
crude oil and natural gas reserves fell 1.2 percent last year on
disposals in Canada,  Egypt  and the U.S.  Reserves declined to 18.071 billion barrels of oil
equivalent as of Dec. 31, from 18.292 billion barrels a year
earlier, London-based BP said today in its  annual report .  The company’s reserves replacement ratio, excluding
acquisitions and divestments, was 106 percent last year, the
18th consecutive annual gain. Net additions, excluding
production, totaled 1.503 billion barrels of oil equivalent last
year, extending BP’s inventory life from 43 to 48 years.  BP in July agreed to sell oil and gas fields in the U.S.,
Canada and Egypt to  Apache Corp. (APA)  for $7 billion, raising cash to
meet the costs of the Gulf of Mexico spill.  To contact the reporter on this story:
