West Ham United won approval from
the U.K. government and London mayor  Boris Johnson  to take over
the 2012 Olympic stadium after the Games.  Under Secretary of State Bob Neill and Minister for Sport
and the Olympics Hugh Robertson approved the recommendation of
the Olympic Park Legacy Co. to allow the London soccer team to
take over the facility. West Ham and its partner, London Borough
of Newham, can now start to negotiate a lease for the site,
according to Neillâ€™s e-mailed statement today confirming the
approval.  West Ham beat out fellow Premier League club Tottenham to
take over the stadium, which will be used for soccer matches as
well as track and field events.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
