Job growth in the U.S. is primarily
in “non-tradable” industries where “we don’t compete
globally,” such as government and health care, said Andrew Michael Spence, winner of the  Nobel Prize  in economic sciences
in 2001.  “We need to work very hard on increasing the effectiveness
of our schools on all levels,” Spence, a professor of economics
at New York University, said today in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with Tom Keene. Spence is also a
consultant at Pacific Investment Management Co.  (In the U.S., hear Bloomberg Radio on satellite radio: Sirius
