Cash premiums for soybeans and corn
shipped this month to terminals near New Orleans widened
relative to Chicago futures on rising demand for U.S. supplies.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for soybeans delivered in
March at  Gulf of Mexico  ports rose to 64 cents to 66 cents a
bushel above May futures from 63 cents to 64 cents yesterday,
U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The corn basis was 51
cents to 52 cents a bushel above May futures, up from 49 cents
to 52 cents. The average bid rose to $7.8825, the highest since
June 27, 2008.  “We had another week of good export sales” for corn and
soybeans, said Glenn Hollander, a partner at Hollander &
Feuerhaken, a cash grain merchandiser and broker in Chicago.
“The basis will start to improve, perhaps significantly, if
there is a further increase in export sales.”  Soybean futures for May delivery advanced 17.75 cents, or
1.3 percent, to close at $14.12 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade, the third consecutive gain. On Feb. 9, the commodity
reached a 30-month high of $14.5575.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 15.25 cents, or 2.1
percent, to close at $7.3675 a bushel in Chicago, the fourth
gain in five sessions. The price has surged 91 percent in the
past 12 months, touching a 31-month high at $7.4425 on Feb. 22.  From Sept. 1 to Feb. 24, cumulative corn sales rose 6.2
percent to 33.97 million metric tons from a year earlier,
according to  government data.  Soybean sales advanced 10 percent
to 39.4 million tons.  Grain Barges  An average of 59 percent of corn and 52 percent of soybean
exports were moved by barge during the five years ending in
2007, according to a  USDA report  in April.  During the week ending Feb. 26, 654 grain barges were
unloaded in  New Orleans , down 10 percent from the previous week,
the USDA said in a  report today . There are 71 vessels expected
to be loaded at terminals near New Orleans during the next 10
days, up 20 percent from last year, the government said.  “The grain elevators that own the supplies are not going
to sell based on rising futures, they want to sell when the
basis improves,” Hollander said. “Supplies are going to get
tight if export demand improves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
