  Portugal Telecom SGPS SA (PT) ’s unit in
Namibia said it opposes a move to force mobile-phone companies
to charge the same rates when subscribers call other networks in
the southern African nation.  A decision by the Namibia Communications Commission, which
regulates telecommunications in the country, will “block
innovation in terms of products and service that are the engine
of competition,” the company,  MTC , said in an e-mailed statement
today.  A bid by the company to block the commission’s move was
rejected by the High Court in Windhoek, the capital, last week,
it said in the statement. MTC has about 1.5 million subscribers
and is Namibia’s biggest carrier.  Leo Namibia, a unit of Egypt’s  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) ,
said the commission’s direction is “a very encouraging sign for
full and proper regulation in the telecommunications market,”
according to a statement published on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
