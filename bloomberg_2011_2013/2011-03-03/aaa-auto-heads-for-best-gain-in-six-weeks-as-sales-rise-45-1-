  AAA Auto Group NV (AAA)  climbed the most
in more than six weeks as sales at the biggest chain of used-car
dealerships in central  Europe  jumped.  The stock rose 3.6 percent to 25.2 koruna at its 4:24 p.m.
close in Prague, its biggest one-day rally since Jan. 19. More
than 63,000 shares changed hands today, or 160 percent of the
daily average in the past three months.  Sales at the Amsterdam-registered company increased an
annual 45 percent in February to 3,684 vehicles, AAA said today
in a statement on its website. The company’s board approved
plans yesterday to expand its business into Russia this year.  “Overall we regard the numbers as very good,” Jan Roh, an
analyst at Cyrrus brokerage in Brno,  Czech Republic , wrote in a
report to clients today. “They confirm that the shape of the
company’s financials is improving.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
