Portugal’s  PSI-20 Index (PSI20)  dropped
26.38, or 0.3 percent, to 7,947.62 at the 5:35 p.m. close in
Lisbon.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Portuguese market today.    Banco BPI SA (BPI)  , Portugal’s fifth-largest bank,
dropped 1.1 percent to 1.4 euros. Banco Comercial Portugues SA
(BCP PL), the second-largest lender, fell 1 percent to 63 cents.  Banco Espirito Santo SA (BES)  , Portugal’s biggest publicly
traded bank, declined 0.8 percent to 3.22 euros.  European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said
the ECB may raise  interest rates  next month to fight
accelerating inflation pressures.  Sonaecom SGPS SA (SNC PL), owner of Portugal’s smallest
mobile phone operator, rose 4.1 percent to 1.48 euros, the
biggest gain in a month. The company said yesterday after the
close that it plans to pay its first dividend to shareholders,
of 5 cents a share on 2010 earnings. “This decision surprised
us, as we were only forecasting the initiation of dividend
distribution in 2013,” said analyst Alexandra Delgado at  Banco
Comercial Portugues SA (BCP)  in a note after the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
