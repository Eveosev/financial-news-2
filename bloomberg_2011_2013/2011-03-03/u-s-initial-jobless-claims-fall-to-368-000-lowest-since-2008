Initial jobless claims unexpectedly
declined last week to the lowest level since May 2008, pointing
to a strengthening labor market.  Applications for  unemployment benefits  decreased by 20,000
to 368,000 in the week ended Feb. 26, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast claims would climb to 395,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
total number of people receiving  unemployment insurance  fell to
the lowest level since October 2008.  Among the reasons for increased optimism about the labor
market in coming months has been a recent drop in initial
claims, Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers
this week. Companies added 200,000 jobs in February, while
unemployment rose to 9.1 percent, economists project a Labor
Department report to show tomorrow.  “Claims are moving in the right direction,” said  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets Corp. in  New York . “The question is when this starts to translate into
more meaningful job growth. It’s probably not that far away. In
the second half you’ll see some acceleration” of job growth.  Jobless claims estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 47
economists ranged from 375,000 to 405,000. The Labor Department
initially reported the prior week’s figures at 395,000. Initial
claims have declined in four of the last five weeks.  Stock-index futures rose after the report and Treasuries
fell. The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.1
percent to 1,319.9 at 8:46 a.m. in New York. The yield on the
benchmark 10-year note rose to 3.53 percent from 3.47 percent
late yesterday.  Four-Week Average  The four-week moving average, a less volatile measure,
dropped to 388,500, the lowest since the week ended July 12,
2008, from 401,250 last week. It was also the first time the
monthly average has been below 400,000 since July 2008.  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
unexpectedly decreased by 59,000 in the week ended Feb. 19 to
3.77 million.  Economists forecast the number would increase to 3.82
million. Figures for continuing claims do not include the number
of workers receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their benefits and are now collecting
emergency and extended payments increased by about 57,000 to 4.5
million in the week ended Feb. 12.  The  unemployment rate  among those eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the national jobless rate, fell to 3
percent from 3.1 percent.  States, Territories  Forty-two states and territories reported a decrease in
claims during the week ended Feb. 19, while 11 had an increase.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  “We do see some grounds for optimism about the job market
over the next few quarters, including notable declines in the
unemployment rate in December and January, a drop in new claims
for unemployment insurance, and an improvement in firms’ hiring
plans,” Bernanke told Congress this week.  So far, the labor market “has improved only slowly” and
it may take “several years” for the unemployment rate to reach
a “more normal level, Bernanke said.  Central bank policy makers will likely keep  interest rates 
near zero and maintain plans to buy $600 billion in  Treasury
securities  by June to boost the pace of recovery until they see
signs of sustained  job creation .  Payrolls increased a fewer-than-forecast 36,000 in January,
depressed by snowstorms that kept some companies from hiring,
the Labor Department reported Feb. 4.  Will Improve  “Overall, when we look at the job market we do believe
that it is on track to improve,”  Don Johnson , vice president of
U.S. sales for  General Motors Co. (GM) , said on a teleconference this
week. “February was quite simply another great month for
General Motors.”  GM said vehicle deliveries last month increased 46 percent
from February 2010.  Some companies are cutting workers. Minneapolis-based  Medtronic Inc. (MDT)  announced on Feb. 22 it will cut 1,500 to 2,000
jobs, or about 4 percent to 5 percent of its workforce, amid
stagnating sales for implanted devices.  To contact the reporters on this story:
