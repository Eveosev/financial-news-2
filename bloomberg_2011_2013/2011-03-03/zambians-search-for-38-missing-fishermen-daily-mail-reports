Zambian authorities are searching
for 38 fishermen thought to have drowned March 1 on Lake Mweru,
the  Daily Mail  said, citing provincial minister Besa Chimbaka.  A boat carrying 42 fishermen from Zambia and the Democratic
Republic of Congo capsized when the weather changed abruptly,
the Lusaka-based  Daily Mail  said on its website. Four fishermen
swam to safety and the rest are still missing, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
