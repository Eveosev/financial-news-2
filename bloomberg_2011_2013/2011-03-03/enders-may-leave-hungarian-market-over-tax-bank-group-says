Hungarian lenders’ mortgage issuance
“may approach zero” or they may exit Hungary altogether after
the government decided to extend a special tax on banks,
Hungarian Bank Association President Tamas Erdei said today.  “Some players may say that they can’t maintain the size
needed for profitability, and possibly merge or gradually wind
down,” Erdei, who is chief executive officer of MKB Bank Zrt.,
Bayerische Landesbank’s Hungarian unit, told state-run M1
television in an interview today.  The European Union’s most indebted eastern member this week
unveiled a program to reduce debt to below 60 percent of gross
domestic product by 2016 from 80 percent in what Economy
Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  called an “attack” on debt. As part
of the measures, the Cabinet delayed plans to cut corporate and
bank taxes.  MKB Bank pays more bank tax than its German parent, which
is more than 30 times its size, Erdei said. Maintaining
Hungary’s moratorium on evictions beyond its current expiry in
April would also further depress the mortgage market constrained
by high taxation, he said.  The portion of borrowers more than 90 days in arrears has
risen above 10 percent and the market may have reached the “low
point” with the number of new arrears already dropping, Erdei
said.  “We are looking ahead to 2011 and 2012 with cautious
optimism” on non-performing loans “both for households and
companies,” Erdei said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
