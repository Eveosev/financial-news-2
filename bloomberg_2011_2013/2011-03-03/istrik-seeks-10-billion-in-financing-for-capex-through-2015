PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara,  Indonesia ’s state utility, seeks to raise as much as 88 trillion
rupiah ($10 billion) in financing through 2015 as it expands
capacity to meet increasing demand for electricity.  Listrik Negara will spend 310 trillion rupiah on capital
expenditure over five years, of which 66 trillion rupiah will be
spent this year, Finance Director Setio Anggoro Dewo said. The
money will come from bond sales, new and existing loans and
internal cash, he said.  “That is our mid-term plan,” Dewo said in a phone
interview today in Jakarta, adding that some funding will come
from the government budget.  Indonesia,  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy, is increasing
domestic use of natural gas to make up for falling crude output
from aging fields, which led to the country withdrawing from the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 2008.  Listrik Negara plans to build new  power plants  generating
23,525 megawatts of power to increase its total capacity to
55,484 megawatts by 2019, Dewo said. The plans to increase
electricity costs to consumers by 10 percent from 2012 to 2013,
and by 2.7 percent from 2014 to 2015, he said.  Listrik Negara may consume 3.5 percent more natural gas
this year as it reduces the use of oil as a fuel at its power
plants, Nur Pamudji, primary energy director, said Feb. 25. Gas
consumption may increase to 293 trillion British thermal units
this year from 283 trillion British thermal units last year, he
said.  The plan will result in 150 megawatts of power capacity
being switched to gas from oil, and reduce fuel costs by as much
as $120 million this year, Pamudji said.  To support the increase in demand for the cleaner burning
fuel, Listrik Negara is considering building a liquefied natural
gas-receiving terminal in Bekasi, east of Jakarta, with an
annual capacity of 1.5 million metric tons, Pamudji said.  Listrik Negara plans to raise its gas-fired power capacity
to 21,000 megawatts by 2019 from 9,800 megawatts currently,
Planning Director Nasri Sebayang said Feb. 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
