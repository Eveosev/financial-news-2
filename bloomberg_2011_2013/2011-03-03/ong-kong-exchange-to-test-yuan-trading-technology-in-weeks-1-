The  Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing
Ltd., the world’s largest-listed exchange operator by market
value, will test its yuan trading support facility in a few
weeks, Chairman Ronald Arculli said today.  “We will go to the market for the participants to test
their readiness and hopefully all the technology side will be
OK,” he said on Bloomberg Television.  The bourse is open to tie-ups similar to the one announced
by the NYSE Euronext and Tokyo Stock Exchange on trade system
links, he said. The exchange has more than 20 initial public
offerings approved by the listing board, Arculli also said.  The simulation test for trading yuan products will be
conducted on March 19 and 20, according to the bourse’s
statement on its website on Feb. 17.  For Related News and Information: Stories on Japan stocks:  To contact the reporter on this story:
