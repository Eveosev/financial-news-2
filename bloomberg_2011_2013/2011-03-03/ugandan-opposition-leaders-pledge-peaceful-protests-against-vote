  Uganda ’s opposition alliance said
they would avoid violence in protests against the Feb. 18
election of President Yoweri Museveni for a fourth term.  Demonstrations will be “peaceful and unarmed,” Margaret
Wokuri, a spokeswoman for the Inter Party Coalition, said today
by e-mail from the capital, Kampala.  Four opposition leaders who lost the presidential election
rejected the poll results on Feb. 24 and urged their supporters
to protest in support of demands for a fresh vote. The group
includes Kizza Besigye of the Forum for Democratic Change, who
won 26 percent of the vote, compared with Museveni’s 68 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
