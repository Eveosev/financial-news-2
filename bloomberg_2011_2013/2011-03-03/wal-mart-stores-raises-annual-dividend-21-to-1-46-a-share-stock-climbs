  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest retailer, said it will boost its annual dividend 21
percent to $1.46 a share.  The quarterly dividend will amount to 36.5 cents a share in
fiscal 2012, the company said in a statement today. Wal-Mart,
led by Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke, said in the statement
that it has returned $19.2 billion to shareholders in the fiscal
year that ended in January. It ended that year with free cash
flow of $10.9 billion.  “This represents an acceleration in the growth rate of the
dividend, which I believe is a very positive action,” said Tim Hoyle, director of research at Haverford Investments. Hoyle is
based in Philadelphia and helps oversee $6 billion in assets,
including Wal-Mart shares.  The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company raised its dividend
11 percent a year ago. The shares rose as high as $52.75 in
trading after the close of the New York Stock Exchange. The
stock gained 4 cents today to $52.01, and has declined 3.6
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
