  Boeing Co. (BA)  is talking to  FedEx Corp (FDX) 
about plans to develop a freighter based on its 767-400ER that
would replace the freight companyâ€™s 72 MD-10s, the FlightBlogger
website reported, citing unidentified people.  Such a plane could help Boeing keep its 767 line going
until production begins on the KC-46A aerial refueling tanker,
FlightBlogger said. Boeing, which already offers a freighter
based on the 767-300, has only 49 outstanding orders for the
plane in its backlog, according to the report.  Story link:  http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/flightblogger   To contact the reporter on this story:
