The Central Bank of West African
States kept its policy rates on hold as it weighs the effects of
rising inflation pressures and a political crisis in  Ivory
Coast , the regional monetary union’s biggest economy.  The marginal lending facility rate was kept at 4.25
percent, the minimum open market rate at 3.25 percent and the
bank reserves requirement at 7 percent, the Dakar-based bank’s
Monetary Policy Committee said on its  website  today.  “The inflation outlook is full of uncertainties” for this
year and next, the committee said in a statement. The region’s
inflation rate rose to 3.9 percent in December from 2.6 percent
in September, it said.  A political stalemate in Ivory Coast since a disputed Nov.
28 election has left the country with two rival administrations.
That may dampen economic growth in the eight-member West Africa
Monetary Union, which shares the CFA franc currency, the
committee said. The bank should try to “preserve the financial
stability in the sub-region,” it said.  Ivory Coast’s economy, which may shrink 4 percent in the
first half of 2011, may “sizeably weigh on output growth” in
the region, said  Samir Gadio , a London-based emerging-markets
strategist with Standard Bank Group Ltd. The central bank may
“pursue a neutral-to-accommodative policy stance in the coming
months” even with inflation-rate pressures, he said in an e-
mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Emily Bowers  in Accra at
