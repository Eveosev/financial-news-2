U.S.  mortgage rates  declined for a
third week, making homebuying more affordable as demand for
properties slumps.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan fell to 4.87
percent in the week ended today from 4.95 percent a week ago,
according to  Freddie Mac . The average 15-year rate was 4.15
percent, down from 4.22 percent, the McLean, Virginia-based
mortgage-finance company said in a statement.  “Mortgage rates saw an overall improvement this week,”
Frank Nothaft, vice president and chief economist of Freddie
Mac, said in the statement. “However, housing demand still
remains weak.”  The housing market struggled at the start of the year with
unemployment at 9 percent and foreclosed properties flooding the
market. The number of Americans signing contracts to buy
previously owned homes dropped 2.8 percent in January, the
National Association of Realtors said Feb. 28. December
contracts were revised to a 3.2 percent decline after the group
initially reported a gain.  Mortgage applications in the U.S. fell 6.5 percent last
week, according to a  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index, which
covers about half of all U.S. retail residential-mortgage
originations. The Washington-based group’s purchase index
decreased 6.1 percent in the week ended Feb. 25, and its
refinancing gauge declined 6.5 percent.  The rate for a 30-year fixed loan reached an eight-month
high of 5.05 percent in February. The decline since then has
pushed the monthly payment for a $300,000 mortgage to about
$1,587 from $1,620.  To contact the reporter on this story: Rebecca McClay in New
