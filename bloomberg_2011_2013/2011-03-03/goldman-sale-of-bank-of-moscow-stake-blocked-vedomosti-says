Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s sale of
shares in Bank of Moscow to VTB Group was blocked by a London
court,  Vedomosti  reported, citing unidentified people familiar
with the matter.  A company affiliated with Bank of Moscow Chief Executive
Officer Andrei Borodin petitioned the court to stop the deal,
saying it has the right of first refusal to buy the shares, the
Moscow-based newspaper reported today, without identifying the
company.  VTB agreed to pay the city of Moscow 103 billion rubles
($3.6 billion) for its 46.5 percent of Bank of Moscow on Feb.
22, and then agreed to buy Goldman Sachs’s 3.88 percent for 7.14
billion rubles to boost its stake to more than 50 percent,
according to Vedomosti. Kommersant newspaper said March 1 that
Borodin and other Bank of Moscow executives agreed to sell their
combined 20 percent stake to VTB, citing VTB.  Vadim Sukhoverkhov, a spokesman for VTB, declined to
comment, as did Elena Zakrevskaya, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman,
and Oleg Fedorchenko, a spokesman for Bank of Moscow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
