Pearlyn Wong, an investment analyst
at Bank Julius Baer Singapore Ltd. comments on oil and stocks
after Al Arabiya TV reported Arab League Secretary General Amr
Moussa as saying the group is studying a plan proposed by
Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  to end violence in Libya.  Crude in  New York  fell as much as 1.8 percent in electronic
trading. Wong spoke in a telephone interview today:  On  oil prices :  “It is clear that this is bad for oil. The market
perception is if there’s an end to the crisis, there won’t be
any potential supply shock.  ‘‘This will reduce the pressure on oil prices because
without a supply shock, there would be enough inventory to meet
current demand. And this might imply that there’s no escalation
of violence spreading to other oil producing nations.”  On stocks:  “This is positive for stocks. Excessive oil prices are
destructive for global demand. High oil prices are not implying
high demand, it’s just implying some sort of crisis situation in
oil producing nations.  ‘‘It implies there may not be further supply shocks. Stocks
that have high input costs from escalating oil prices will
benefit from this.’’
