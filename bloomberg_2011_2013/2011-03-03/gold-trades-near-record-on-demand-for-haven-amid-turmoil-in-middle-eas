Gold futures fell the most in six
weeks after  Venezuela  offered to mediate a resolution to the
crisis in Libya. Silver had the biggest drop since late
January.  The Arab League said it is weighing an offer by Venezuelan
President  Hugo Chavez  to mediate the civil conflict in Libya.
Yesterday, gold rose to a record of $1,441 an ounce as turmoil
in the Middle East, the world’s biggest oil-producing region,
boosted demand for an investment haven.  “Peace, if it happens, may be bearish for gold and
silver,” said  Dennis Gartman , an economist and the editor of
the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter. “It is time again
to head to the sidelines in gold and precious metals.”  Gold futures for April delivery fell $21.30, or 1.5
percent, to settle at $1,416.40 at 1:51 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest slide since Jan. 20. The metal has gained 24
percent in the past year.  U.S. equities rallied today, and oil headed for the biggest
drop in almost three weeks.  Gold’s 14-day relative-strength index topped 70 in the
previous two days, a signal to some traders that the price is
poised to fall.  “There are a lot of sell stops below the record in case
this was a false breakout, so you’re seeing people bail
quickly,” said  Matthew Zeman , a market strategist at Kingsview
Financial in  Chicago .  Silver futures for May delivery fell 50.8 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $34.327 an ounce, the biggest drop since Jan. 25.
Yesterday, the metal reached $34.975, the highest since March 7,
1980. That year, the price climbed to a record of $50.35. The
commodity has almost doubled in the past 12 months.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $7.85, or 1
percent, to $814.80 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price has jumped 81 percent in the past 12 months.  Platinum futures for April delivery fell $26.30, or 1.4
percent, to $1,833 an ounce. The metal has gained 16 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
