Eisai Co. forecast sales will be
little changed for the next five years after losing patent
protection on its Aricept pill, the world’s bestselling
treatment for  Alzheimer’s disease .  Revenue may exceed 800 billion yen ($9.7 billion) in the
year ending March 2016, the Tokyo-based company said in
presentation material today. It had sales of 803.1 billion yen
last fiscal year and is forecasting 770 billion in revenue for
the 12 months ending March 31.  Eisai will cut at least 900 jobs over the next five years
as it seeks to improve operating margins to cope with
competition from cheaper, generic versions of Aricept. The pill,
which lost patent protection in the U.S. in November, generated
322.8 billion yen in revenue, or about 40 percent of sales, last
fiscal year.  The drugmaker is targeting an operating margin, or the
amount of operating profit on each yen of revenue, of 25 percent
by fiscal 2016, from 15 percent, according to the presentation
material, which was filed with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Annual
operating profit is forecast to be at least 200 billion yen in
five years, the company said.  The forecasts were announced after markets in Japan closed.  Eisai gained 20 yen, or 0.7 percent, to a five-month high
of 3,100 yen. The benchmark Topix index advanced 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
