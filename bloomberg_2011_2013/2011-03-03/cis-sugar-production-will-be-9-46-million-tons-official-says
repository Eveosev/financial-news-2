The 11 nations in the  Commonwealth
of Independent States  probably will produce 9.46 million metric
tons of white, or refined, sugar in 2011, according to the  CIS
executive committee .  Russian output will be highest at 5.5 million tons, Andrei
Kushnarenko, head of the committee’s economy department, said at
the “Sugar Market of CIS Countries 2011: Present and
Prospects” conference in Moscow today. Production will come to
2 million tons in Ukraine, 450,000 tons in Kazakhstan, 350,000
tons in Belarus and 300,000 tons in  Azerbaijan , he said.  The CIS comprises the republics that made up the former  Soviet Union  except Georgia, which exited the bloc in 2009, and
the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Ukraine and
Turkmenistan, though not full members, participate in all CIS
activities and were included in the production estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
