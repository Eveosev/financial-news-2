  Metro Pacific Investments Corp. (MPI) , the
operator of  power lines , waterworks and toll roads in the
Philippines, said growth in dividend payouts will be
“constrained” in the next 4-5 years as it spends on expansion.  “Our units will be using their cashflow for their
expansion and projects,” President Jose Lim said today, after
the Manila-based company reported a record 2.87 billion pesos
($66 million) profit for last year. Metro Pacific plans to pay
2.5 centavos a share in total dividends this year, including the
1.5 centavos a share announced today, according to a statement.  The company and its units will invest about 22 billion
pesos for expansion this year, Chief Financial Officer David Nicol said.  Manila Electric Co. (MER)  plans to spend 11 billion pesos
while Maynilad Water Services Inc. may invest 10 billion pesos,
he said.   Metro Pacific rose 0.6 percent to 3.47 pesos at the noon
close of trading in Manila before the earnings announcement. The
company was created in 2006 to reorganize the failed property
venture of Hong Kong’s First Pacific Co. in the Philippines.  Traffic at the toll road operated by Metro Pacific Tollways
Corp. grew at an average 3 percent pace in January and February,
compared with a 7 percent average in 2010, according to
Ramoncito Fernandez, the unit’s president. Higher  oil prices 
damped traffic growth, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
