Ethanol futures slipped in  Chicago 
as crude oil and gasoline declined on speculation that mediation
proposed for Libya will curb threats to oil supply disruptions,
reducing the appeal of biofuels.  The grain-based gasoline additive declined 0.3 percent
after the  Arab League  said it’s considering Venezuelan President
Hugo Chavez’s offer to help settle Libya’s civil conflict. The
unrest has cut Libyan oil output, according to the  International
Energy Agency .  “Ethanol seems stuck between an agriculture and energies
headline grab, although the upward trend remains intact,” SCB &
Associates LLC of Chicago said in an e-mailed report.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery slid 0.7 cent to
$2.583 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures are 56
percent higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast was
unchanged at $2.68 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive
increased 2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.665, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago gained 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$2.605 a gallon and in  New York  rose 0.5 cent to $2.685.  Crude for April delivery slid 32 cents to settle at $101.91
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have risen
26 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for April delivery declined 0.33 cent to $3.0262 a
gallon in New York. The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Corn futures for May delivery advanced 15.25 cents, or 2.1
percent, to close at $7.3675 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel of
the grain makes about 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  An average ethanol mill in Iowa is break-even after on
every gallon produced, while a plant in  Illinois  is pocketing
about 3 cents after losing a penny last week, according to Ag
Trader Talk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
