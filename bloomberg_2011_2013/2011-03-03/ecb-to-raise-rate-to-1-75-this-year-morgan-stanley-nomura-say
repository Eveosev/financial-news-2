The  European Central Bank  will raise
its benchmark lending rate to 1.75 percent by the end of the
year after President Jean-Claude Trichet said it may increase
borrowing costs next month, economists at Unicredit Group,
Morgan Stanley, Nomura International and J.P. Morgan said.  While Trichet said an increase next month would not
necessarily be the start of a series, “an isolated rate move
makes little sense, particularly now that the ECB is becoming
more confident on the sustainability of the recovery,”  Marco Valli , an economist at UniCredit bank in Milan, said in an e-
mailed note. He sees the ECB increasing the rate again in
September and December.  Trichet’s announcement today that “strong vigilance is
warranted” and an increase from a record low of 1 percent next
month is “possible” surprised markets, pushing up the euro and
government bond yields. The median forecast of 37 economists in
a Feb. 25 Bloomberg News survey was for the first rate increase
in the fourth quarter.  BNP Paribas economist  Ken Wattret  said the ECB may raise
its main rate to 2 percent this year as inflation is “going to
be very problematic” in the coming months. ABN Amro economist  Nick Kounis  and Citigroup Inc. economist  Juergen Michels  predict
two rate increases, with the benchmark at 1.5 percent at the end
of the year.  “I am not sure that we will go too much higher given Mr.
Trichet’s indication that this was not the start of a series,”
Kounis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
