A Grupo Andrade Gutierrez unit may
take a stake in the group building the Belo Monte hydroelectric
dam in  Brazil ,  Valor Economico  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The AG Participacoes business may take a 12.5 percent stake
in the group, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said. Andrade
Gutierrez’s external press communications office in Sao Paulo
didn’t return a call and an e-mail before office hours seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
