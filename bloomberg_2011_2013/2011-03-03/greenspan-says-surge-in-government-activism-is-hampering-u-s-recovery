Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Alan Greenspan  said a surge in U.S. government “activism,”
including fiscal stimulus, housing subsidies and new
regulations, is holding back the economic recovery.  Increased bond issuance by the Treasury Department crowds
out borrowers with the weakest credit ratings, Greenspan said in
an article in International Finance, published on the Web today.
At least half of the shortfall in companies’ capital spending
“can be explained by the shock of vastly greater government-
created uncertainties embedded in the competitive, regulatory
and financial environments” since the failure of  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)  in 2008, Greenspan said.  Greenspan’s conclusions fit with his long-held free-market
ideology and may aid Republican lawmakers who argue that cutting
federal spending now will help spur job growth. Critics
including members of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission
have said Greenspan’s failure to regulate the mortgage market
last decade helped fuel the housing bubble whose bursting
precipitated the financial crisis.  “Much intervention turns out to hobble markets rather than
enhancing them,” said Greenspan, 84, who was appointed Fed
chairman by Republican President  Ronald Reagan  in 1987 and
served until 2006. “Any withdrawal of action to allow the
economy to heal could restore some, or much, of the dynamic of
the pre-crisis decade, without its imbalances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
