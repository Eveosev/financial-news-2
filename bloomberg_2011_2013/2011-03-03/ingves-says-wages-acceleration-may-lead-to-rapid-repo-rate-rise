Swedish central bank Governor Stefan Ingves said accelerating wage growth may require faster monetary
tightening than the bank has signaled so far.  “Labor shortages in combination with a strong economic
climate may lead to a situation in which wages increase at a
faster rate,” Ingves said in comments to a parliamentary
committee in  Stockholm  today. “In that case, inflation will be
higher and it may be necessary to raise the repo rate more
rapidly.”  Headline inflation has exceeded the Riksbank’s 2 percent
target the last two months, and accelerated to 2.5 percent in
January. “The labor market is on the road to recovery, and
unemployment is falling,” Ingves said today. “Prices are
increasing on the world’s commodity markets, contributing to
rising inflation.”  The krona is the best performing major currency this year
against the dollar, the euro and the yen, according to data
available on Bloomberg. The krona gained 0.1 percent against the
euro, to trade at 8.7464 at 9:56 a.m. in Stockholm.  The  exchange rate  “is not a worry” for  Sweden ’s economy,
Ingves said.  “Our main scenario for future developments suggests the
stable recovery of the Swedish economy and gradual increases of
the repo rate,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
