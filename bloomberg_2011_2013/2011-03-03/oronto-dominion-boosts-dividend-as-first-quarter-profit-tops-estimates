  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the Canadian
bank that agreed to buy auto lender Chrysler Financial Corp.,
said first-quarter profit climbed 19 percent on higher consumer-
banking earnings. The lender boosted its quarterly dividend for
the first time in almost three years, to 66 cents a share.  Net income for the period ended Jan. 31 rose to C$1.54
billion ($1.58 billion), or C$1.69 a share, from C$1.3 billion,
or C$1.44, a year earlier, the Toronto-based lender said today
in a statement. Results topped analysts’ estimates.  Toronto-Dominion is Canada’s second-biggest bank.  (Toronto-Dominion will hold a conference call at 3 p.m. Toronto
