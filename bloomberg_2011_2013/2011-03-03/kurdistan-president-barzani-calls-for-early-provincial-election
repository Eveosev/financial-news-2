Massoud Barzani, president of  Iraqi
Kurdistan , called for early elections in the semi-autonomous
region after days of protests demanding better services and more
accountability from elected officials.  The Kurdistan Regional Government and its parliament should
consider immediately starting preparations for elections in the
three provinces of Dohuk, Erbil, and Sulaimaniyah, which form
Kurdistan, Barzani said during a televised address today,
according to a statement posted on the KRG website. He didn’t
give a date.  Barzani said young people had displayed political maturity
in airing their demands through peaceful protests, and urged
them to avoid resorting to violence. Security forces and
demonstrators have clashed in the region in recent weeks.  “Our people have the right to demonstrate and air their
grievances using peaceful means,” Barzani was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
