Contracts tied to the cost of
shipping Middle East oil jumped 11 percent because of
speculation  Saudi Arabia  will ship more crude to compensate for
lost Libyan production and as fuel prices rose.  Forward freight agreements tied to the cost of shipping
Saudi Arabian oil to Japan rose to the equivalent of $33,200 a
day from a closing value of about $30,000 yesterday, Will Leslie, head of tanker derivatives at broker ACM-GFI in  London ,
said today by e-mail.  Saudi Arabia has said it is ready to make up for any
shortfall in Libyan oil shipments as an uprising in the North
African country threatens to disrupt production in the holder of
the continent’s largest oil reserves. Such a change could cause
longer distance shipments from the Middle East, according to
owners including Overseas Shipholding Group and Teekay Tanker
Services.    Libya , combined with high fuel costs and thus slow
steaming, is what is driving the forward curve momentum,”
Leslie said.  Higher fuel prices increase the incentive for owners to
lower speeds to save on their biggest expenditure, a move that
can cut fleet supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
