  Zaklady Chemiczne Police SA (PCE) ,
Poland’s second-largest fertilizer maker, jumped the most in two
weeks as the government said foreign investors, including Nurol
Holding of Turkey, were interested in buying its stake.  The shares rallied 6.4 percent to 10.80 zloty at 10:59 a.m.
in Warsaw, rising for a third day.  “Nurol sent us a letter of intent, expressing interest in
the sale of the company,”  Maciej Wewior , a spokesman for the
Treasury Ministry, said by phone today. “Nurol is not the only
investor interested in the sale and we also have signals from
other potential buyers from  Europe  and from outside Europe.”  The government in January ended the process of sales of its
majority stakes in Chemiczne Police and larger competitor  Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy SA (ZAP)  without picking buyers as it didn’t
receive “satisfactory” offers.  The treasury will likely present its new sale plans for
state-owned chemical producers, which also include Azoty Tarnow
and  Ciech SA (CIE) , by early next month, Wewior said.  A preliminary meeting took place and Nurol hasn’t yet
evaluated the results or taken any decision, an official for the
Ankara-based company said, declining to be named because of
company policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
