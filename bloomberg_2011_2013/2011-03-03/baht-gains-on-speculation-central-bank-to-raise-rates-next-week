Thailand’s baht rose for a fourth
day on speculation the central bank will raise borrowing costs
at its meeting next week to tame inflation.  Policy makers may boost the one-day bond repurchase rate by
a quarter-percentage point on March 9 to 2.5 percent, the fifth
increase since June, according to six of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Two predict no change. Crude oil
trading near a two-year high is fueling concern inflation will
accelerate further, according to  Hideki Hayashi , a global
economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo.  “With gains in  oil prices , emerging countries with strong
economic growth like Thailand will probably need to hike rates,
providing underlying support for the baht,” Hayashi said. “The
rate-hike speculation next week also put pressure on interest-
rate swaps to rise.”  The baht appreciated 0.2 percent to 30.50 per dollar as of
8:34 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency may strengthen to around 30.40 by the end of next
week, Hayashi said.  The onshore one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, climbed four basis points
to 2.70 percent and is up from 2.64 percent at the end of last
week.  The Bank of  Thailand  lifted the policy rate at its last
meeting on Jan. 12 by 25 basis points to 2.25 percent and
signaled further increases. The core inflation index, which
excludes fresh food and fuel prices, rose 1.45 percent in
February, accelerating from the 1.32 percent pace the previous
month, official data released on March 1 showed.    Government bonds  advanced. The yield on the 3.125 percent
debt due December 2015 fell three basis points to 3.42 percent.
A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
