  Damien Hirst  will get his first U.K.
retrospective in 2012, as Tate Modern schedules a survey of his
career around the 2012  London   Olympic Games , Tate said today.  Some seventy works by the British artist -- including his
shark in formaldehyde, “The Physical Impossibility of Death in
the Mind of Someone Living” (1991) -- will go on display in the
exhibition, which is sponsored by the Qatar Museums Authority. A
room will be devoted to works from Hirst’s “Beautiful Inside My
Head Forever” sale, which raised 111.5 million pounds (then
$199 million) in September 2008. The Hirst show runs from April
5 to Sept. 9, 2012.  “We were keen to show British artists at Tate Modern”
during the Olympic year, Tate Director Nicholas Serota said at a
news conference. “It seemed simply, to us, to be the right
moment.”  Serota said progress had been made on building Tate
Modern’s new wing -- also planned for the Olympic year. “‘We
have raised more money in the last three to four months,” he
said. “We will be able to use the new building in 2012.”  Tate Modern has hired architects Herzog & De Meuron to
build it a 215 million pound extension. So far, just over 100
million pounds have been raised, which could throw into question
the building’s completion by 2012.  Serota said more details would be given out in May.  Turbine Hall  Tate Modern also said it has commissioned Tino Sehgal for
its Turbine Hall entrance-lobby installation in 2012 (July 17 to
Oct. 28). Sehgal -- who had a solo show at the Guggenheim in  New
York  last year -- avoids making objects, and focuses instead on
interaction with the public.  “This is Propaganda” (2002) involved a female museum
attendant singing out the artwork’s title every time a visitor
walked in.  Other Tate exhibitions in 2012 include:  - Edvard Munch at Tate Modern (June 28 - Oct. 14, 2012), a
collaboration with the Pompidou Center in Paris;  - “Picasso and Britain” at Tate Britain (Feb. 15 - July
15, 2012), spotlighting the Spanish master’s influence on
British artists;  - “Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde” at Tate
Britain (Sept. 12, 2012 - Jan. 13, 2013).  To contact the writer on the story:
