  Riversdale Mining Ltd. (RIV) , an
Australian mining company, will start production at its Zambeze
coal project in  Mozambique  in 2014, said David West, its
principal geologist in the southern African country.  Riversdale has 10 drill rigs on site and an exploration
staff of 60 people, including 26 geologists, who are currently
completing a feasibility study, West said in an e-mailed
response to questions today.  The project has an estimated coal resource of 9 billion
metric tons, more than double the Benga project that will start
exporting in September, he said. Riversdale will probably
initially produce 45 million metric tons of coal a year from
Zambeze, West said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
