  ConocoPhillips (COP)  reported a process
upset in a fluid catalytic cracking unit at the Borger refinery
in  Texas , according to a filing with state regulators. The unit
is a refineryâ€™s main producer of gasoline.  Emissions associated with the upset began at 2 p.m. local
time yesterday and lasted six minutes, Houston-based
ConocoPhillips said in the  filing  with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  The refinery, about 50 miles northeast of Amarillo, can
process 154,000 barrels of crude a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
