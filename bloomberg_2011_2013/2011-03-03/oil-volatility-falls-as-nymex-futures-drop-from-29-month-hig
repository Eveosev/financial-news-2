Crude oil options volatility slipped
after the underlying futures fell from a 29-month high as  Venezuela  offered to mediate the conflict in Libya,  Africa â€™s
third-largest oil producer.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 37.7 percent, down from 42 percent
yesterday. It was 27.2 percent on Feb. 11, the day Egyptian
President  Hosni Mubarak  left office.  Oil for April delivery slid 32 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$101.91 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
have risen 26 percent in the past year.  April $100 calls were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 1,395 lots changing hands. They fell 55
cents to $3.98 a barrel. April $105 calls, the next most active
contract, retreated 44 cents to $1.95 a barrel with 1,381
contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $150 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 10,305 lots changing hands. They gained 8 cents
to 72 cents a barrel. The next most active option, May $125
calls, increased 46 cents to $1.36 a barrel on 6,313 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
