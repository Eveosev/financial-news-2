  China ’s non-manufacturing industries
contracted in February for the first time in a year because of a
weeklong Lunar New Year holiday.  The Non-Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to
44.1 from 56.4 in January, the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said on its website today. The gauge also dropped
below 50 in February last year. A reading above 50 indicates an
expansion.  “The pullback is mainly due to seasonal factors,” Cai Jin,
vice president of the federation, said in a statement.
“Excluding that, the momentum of the indicator is still running
at its normal trend.”  The sub-index for consumption-related businesses dropped to
46.5 in February from 62.6 the previous month, according to the
survey which is released jointly with the  National Bureau of
Statistics .  The sub-index for new property orders declined to 39.7 in
February from 42 in January, the fifth monthly decline, the
federation said.  The gauge for business prospects climbed to 68.7 from 68.1
the previous month, indicating companies are “optimistic”
about the business outlook, the federation said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
