Syncrude oil’s premium to the
benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate jumped to the highest level
since at least 2006 as  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  said
today it would be months before full production returns at its
Horizon upgrader in  Alberta .  The Calgary-based company halted production at the 110,000-
barrel-a-day upgrader after a Jan. 6 fire and expects to resume
full output in the third quarter. The plant will return to about
half production in the second quarter.  The premium for Syncrude against WTI rose $1.35 a barrel to
$16.85, according to data compiled by Bloomberg at 12:20 p.m. in  New York , the highest level since Bloomberg began tracking the
data in March 2006.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed $2.60 to $17.10 a
barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI weakened $3 to
$17.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend
weakened $1.60 to $11.15 a barrel over WTI, while Poseidon’s
premium narrowed $2.10 to $11.40.  Thunder Horse’s premium to WTI narrowed 80 cents to $17.50.
Southern Green Canyon weakened $2.75 to $10 over.  West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 25 cents to $3.50. WTS
is delivered in Midland, Texas, so its price is less influenced
by imports.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $1 a barrel
to $20.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
