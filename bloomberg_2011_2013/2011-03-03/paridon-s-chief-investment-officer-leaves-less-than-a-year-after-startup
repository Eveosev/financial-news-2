Paridon  Asia  Pte, which started an
Asia macro hedge fund less than a year ago, said its chief
investment officer, Paul Berg, has left the firm.  Chief Executive Officer Robert van Paridon said in an e-
mailed reply to queries from Bloomberg News that he has taken
over the role of chief investment officer. He didn’t provide
further details.  The Singapore-based firm started trading $11 million of the
principals’ money in May, of which $10 million was van Paridon’s
and $1 million came from Berg, they said in September. The CEO
had also committed enough resources for the firm, which started
with nine employees, to operate for the next two to three years,
van Paridon said then.  Berg was formerly the investment director for macro and
derivative strategies at Prudential Asset Management, where he
oversaw more than $2 billion in assets. He declined to comment
today.  The firm had planned to raise assets from institutional
investors such as pension funds, insurance firms and endowments
to increase the size of the Paridon Asia Macro Fund to $250
million, van Paridon said in September. Macro funds seek to
profit from broad economic trends by trading currencies, bonds,
stocks and commodities.  Van Paridon previously held various senior executive
positions at ABN Amro Group NV in  Europe , the U.S. and Asia,
including heading its investment banking business in  New York 
and as managing director of fixed income and foreign exchange in
Tokyo. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc acquired the Dutch bank
in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
