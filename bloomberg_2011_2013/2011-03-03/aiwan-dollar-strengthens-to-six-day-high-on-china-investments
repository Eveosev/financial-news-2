  Taiwan ’s dollar gained to its
strongest level in more than a week after the island allowed
Chinese investors to buy stakes in its flat-panel and chip-
manufacturing companies.  The currency also appreciated after the  Federal Reserve 
said yesterday the U.S. labor market improved early this year,
driven by increasing retail sales and manufacturing, brightening
the outlook for exports to the world’s biggest economy. Chinese
investors may own stakes of as much as 10 percent in Taiwanese
semiconductor or flat-panel makers, and less than 50 percent in
ventures with Taiwanese companies, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs said yesterday.  “The deal between  China  and Taiwan might increase demand
for the local dollar from Chinese investors,” said Tarsicio
Tong, a Taipei-based currency trader at the Union Bank of
Taiwan. “We’ve seen some U.S. dollar weakness.”  Taiwan’s dollar closed 0.4 percent stronger at NT$29.542,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.480
earlier, the strongest level since Feb. 22.    Government bonds  fell. The yield on the 1.375 percent bond
due March 2021, the most-traded government debt, increased one
basis point to 1.43 percent in Taipei, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The rate fell two basis points yesterday, the
biggest decline for a benchmark 10-year debt in more than two
weeks. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
