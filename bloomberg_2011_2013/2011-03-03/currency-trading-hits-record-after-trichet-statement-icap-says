Currency transactions reached a
record during one minute after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  issued a statement following the bank’s rate
meeting today, according to data from ICAP, the world’s largest
broker of trades between banks.  ICAP’s EBS trading platform logged 3,685 transactions at
1:33 p.m. Greenwich mean time, or 8:33 a.m. in New York, Guy Taylor, ICAP spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Trichet, speaking in Frankfurt after the ECB’s policy
meeting, said the central bank may raise  interest rates  next
month for the first time since 2008 to curb accelerating
inflation pressures. The ECB kept its key rate at 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
