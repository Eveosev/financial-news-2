shilling, or 3.4 percent to 28.75 shillings. The shares rallied
11 percent from Feb. 22 until yesterday, when stock’s relative

shillings ($4.58 million) in the 12 months through December.  “Most of the investors had factored in the profit when
they were buying the stock so many of them have made their
returns and are now selling, that is why there is a lot of
supply,” Mercy Njoroge, an analyst at Tsavo Securities Ltd.,
said in a phone interview from Nairobi.    Sasini Ltd. (STCL)  , a Kenyan tea and coffee grower, fell
to the lowest in a year, dropping 25 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
10.3 shillings. Kenya experienced drier-than-usual weather in
October through December because of the La Nina phenomenon,
which occurs when the surface of the Pacific Ocean cools and
reduces moisture in the atmosphere. The drought has disrupted
food supplies in the northern, eastern and coastal regions,
Japanese Ambassador to Kenya Toshihisa Takata told reporters in
Nairobi yesterday.  Sasini “will be affected by drought for the next few
months,” Tsavo’s Njoroge said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
