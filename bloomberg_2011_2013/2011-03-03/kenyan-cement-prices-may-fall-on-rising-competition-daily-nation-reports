Cement prices in  Kenya  may fall as
much as 10 percent this year because of increased competition,
 Business Daily  reported, citing the heads of two domestic
producers of the building material.  In December, wholesale prices for a 50-kilogram (110-pound)
bag of cement dropped to 600 shillings ($7.25) from 660
shillings previously, the Nairobi-based newspaper said. A
further decline may reduce cement companiesâ€™ profits, it said,
citing East African Portland Cement Co. Chief Executive Officer
Kephar Tande and  Athi River Mining Ltd. (ARML)  Managing Director
Pradeep Paunrana.  To contact the reporter on this story:
