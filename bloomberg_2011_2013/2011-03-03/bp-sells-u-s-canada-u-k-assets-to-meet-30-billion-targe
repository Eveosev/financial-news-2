  BP Plc (BP/)  is selling assets in the
U.S.,  Canada  and the U.K. to meet a $30 billion target, in part
to pay for the Gulf of Mexico spill, the worst ever in the U.S.  The company is selling its interest in the Tuscaloosa
fields in Louisiana, the Wattenberg plant in  Colorado  and its
natural-gas liquids business in Canada, it said today in its
 annual report . BP is also  marketing  the Wytch Farm onshore oil
and gas fields in the southern North Sea in the U.K., including
associated pipelines and the Dimlington terminal.  BP completed the sale of its holding in  Questar Overthrust
Pipeline Co  assets, including Painter gas and reservoir units,
and the Whitney Canyon field, to Merit Energy Co. for $217
million in August, the London-based explorer said.  BP last year pledged to sell as much as $30 billion of
assets to help cover costs from the Gulf oil spill. The producer
may create value for shareholders by extending asset sales,
increasing the dividend and through share buybacks, Chief
Executive Officer  Robert Dudley  said last month. It has so far
sold $22 billion of assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
