  Areva SA (CEI) , the biggest supplier of
nuclear fuel and services, scrapped its dividend payout for 2010
and reported full-year profit that missed estimates on charges.  Net income rose 60 percent to 883 million euros ($1.23
billion), less than the 1.06 billion-euro estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of analysts. Paris-based Areva had an operating
loss of 423 million euros, after a profit of 97 million euros in
2010. Areva is targeting an operating margin of more than 5
percent this year, and at least 10 percent for 2012, it said.  Areva’s supervisory board mandated three of its members in
January to prepare for “the renewal or the succession” of
executives whose terms end in June. The fate of Chief Executive
Officer  Anne Lauvergeon , who has expressed a desire to remain at
the helm for a third term after June, has been the topic of
speculation amid delays and cost overruns, and public spats with
Electricite de  France  SA, Areva’s biggest customer.  Potential successors of Lauvergeon, 51, include European
Aeronautic, Defense & Space Co. Chief Marketing and Strategy
Officer Marwan Lahoud, former Trade Minister Anne-Marie Idrac,
and Laurent Collet-Billon, head of France’s arms-procurement
agency, Challenges and La Tribune have reported this year,
without citing anyone. Rhodia CEO Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, also
tipped to be approached, has said he’s not part of the process.  Charges  The company took a 126 million-euro impairment charge in
the second half following the delay of a mine in  Namibia , as
well as a charge of 121 million euros to close another site. In  Finland , Areva has already booked 2.6 billion euros of
provisions since the start the construction in 2005 of a 1,600
megawatt reactor, the first of its kind. Areva aims to complete
the plant by the end of 2012, more than three years late.  To shore up the group’s finances, Lauvergeon, who is
planning to invest up to 4 billion euros on equipment, plants
and uranium mines in the 2011-2012 period, sold Areva’s power-
grid unit and some minority interests last year. Profit last
year jumped from 552 million euros as a result.  In December, Areva raised 900 million euros selling new
shares to France and a Kuwaiti sovereign fund. That fell short
of Lauvergeon’s plan to raise 3 billion euros as the French
government couldn’t agree on terms of the capital increase with  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)  and a Qatari sovereign fund.  The French government and state-owned Commissariat a
l’Energie Atomique and Caisse des Depots et Consignations
together hold 85.7 percent of Areva. State-controlled EDF holds
2.2 percent of Areva, and  Kuwait Investment Authority  owns 4.8
percent of the French nuclear company.  About 4 percent of Areva trades on the Paris stock exchange
as non-voting investment certificates. They have lost 2 percent
this year, valuing the company at 13 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
