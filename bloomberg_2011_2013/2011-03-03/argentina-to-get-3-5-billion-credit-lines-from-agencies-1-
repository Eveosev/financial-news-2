  Argentina  signed agreements to
receive a total of $3.5 billion in credit lines from lenders
including the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank,
President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  said in  Buenos Aires .  Fernandez said the agreement with the lenders is a sign
that the country has regained the confidence of the
international community almost a decade after defaulting on $95
billion in bonds. The funds will be used to pay for
infrastructure projects including railways, clean water and
energy, she said in Buenos Aires today.  “Nobody loans to someone who doesn’t pay,” said Fernandez,
who restructured $12.9 billion in defaulted debt last year.
“What’s important is that we have to be able to restructure our
public and private debts.”  The loans will help Fernandez, 58, boost spending in  South
America ’s second-largest economy ahead of presidential elections
in October. Government spending rose 39 percent to 37.8 billion
pesos ($9.4 billion) in January from a year earlier, while tax
revenue climbed 41.7 percent to 39.9 billion pesos.  Fernandez hasn’t said whether she will be a candidate in
the October race.  South America’s second-biggest economy is forecast to grow
5.1 percent this year after expanding 9.2 percent in 2010,
according to the median estimate of 8 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
