  Peru ’s dollar bonds rose, narrowing
the average yield gap over U.S. Treasuries the most in five
weeks, after  oil prices  fell as Venezuela offered to mediate the
conflict in Libya, boosting investor appetite for emerging-
market assets.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian  government
bonds  instead of U.S. Treasuries dropped 12 basis points, or
0.12 percentage point, to 130 at 3:53 p.m.  New York  time,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. That’s the sharpest fall since
Jan. 26.  Oil fell in New York for the first time in three days on
the Venezuelan offer, and after the Associated Press reported
army deserters secured oil facilities in the rebel-held port of
Brega on the Gulf of Sidra. Crude surged to a 29-month high
yesterday on concern the turmoil curbing  Libya ’s exports will
spread.  “It’s a lot about what’s happening in the Middle East and
the prospects for oil,” said Alejandro Urbina, an emerging-
market debt manager in Chicago at Silva Capital. “For the next
few days we could see some relief in oil prices and that could
be constructive for risk-taking.”  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 was unchanged at 6.30 percent, according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The Peruvian sol rose less than 0.1 percent to 2.7705 per
U.S. dollar, from 2.7715 yesterday.  Peru’s central bank didn’t buy dollars in the foreign
exchange market today, it said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
