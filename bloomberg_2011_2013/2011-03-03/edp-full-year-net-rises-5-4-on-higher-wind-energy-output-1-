EDP-Energias de Portugal SA, the
country’s biggest power company, said full-year profit rose 5.4
percent, helped by higher output from its wind energy projects.  Net income climbed to 1.08 billion euros ($1.5 billion)
from 1.02 billion euros in 2009, Lisbon-based EDP said today in
a regulatory filing. That compares with the 1.07 billion-euro
mean estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The former Portuguese power monopoly is spending on new
dams and wind turbines in  Europe ,  Brazil  and the U.S. to rely
less on oil and coal while tapping government incentives for
alternative energy. The utility in November cut its average
annual investment target for 2011 and 2012 to 2.1 billion euros
from an earlier forecast of 2.4 billion euros a year.  “The market context has been demanding,” Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Mexia said today at a press conference in
Lisbon.  Shares of EDP rose 0.6 percent to close at 2.788 euros in
Lisbon today before the earnings announcement. The stock has
climbed 12 percent this year, giving the company a market value
of 10.2 billion euros.  EDP on May 20 said it forecasts profit will rise annually
by an average 6 percent to 8 percent from 2009 to 2012, while
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization
will climb 7 percent to 8 percent.  Wind Energy  Ebitda rose 7.4 percent to 3.61 billion euros in 2010.
Ebitda from the wind energy division climbed 31 percent. Net
debt increased to 16.3 billion euros at the end of December from
14 billion euros in 2009, the company said.  EDP in May forecast total installed capacity will increase
20 percent to 24.6 gigawatts in 2012, with wind projects and
hydropower plants accounting for 66 percent. A 1-megawatt plant
can supply about 1,000 average European homes. The company’s
installed capacity increased 7 percent to 22 gigawatts in 2010
and total output rose 9 percent, EDP said on Feb. 3.    EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the company’s renewable-energy division,
plans to install 0.8 gigawatts to 0.9 gigawatts of capacity a
year in 2011 and 2012.  The  Portuguese government  owns 20 percent of EDP and state-
owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos SA holds 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
