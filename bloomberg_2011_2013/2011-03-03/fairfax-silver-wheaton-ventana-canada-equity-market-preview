Canadian stocks rose for a third day
as gold and energy shares gained after Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  sent troops to battle rebels for control of oil ports.    Goldcorp Inc. (G)  increased 1.9 percent as precious metals
advanced on demand for a haven from the political turmoil.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW)  and  New Gold Inc. (NGD)  gained at least 2.7
percent after their earnings beat analyst estimates. Canadian
Natural Resources Inc. climbed 3.3 percent as oil rallied on
supply concerns.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 38.05
points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 14,252.77 in Toronto for a
1.4 percent weekly gain.  “The gold sector has been moving on geopolitical risk
concerns,” said Mathieu Roy, who helps manage C$1.5 billion
($1.54 billion) as a money manager at Louisbourg Investments
Inc. in Moncton, New Brunswick. “Crude is also strong today.
The producers are going to do quite well. I don’t think oil is
going back to $80 anytime soon.”  The Canadian benchmark equity index added 6 percent from
the beginning of the year as oil soared 15 percent on concern
that unrest in the Middle East and northern  Africa  will restrict
supply. Gold futures have gained 8.5 percent since Jan. 27.  Gold climbed 0.9 percent to settle at $1,428.60 an ounce in  New York  after Libyan opposition leaders rejected a mediation
offer by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez as armed rebels fought
for control of crude-oil ports on the central and eastern
coastal trip, boosting the appeal of the metal as a safe haven.  Beating Estimates  New Gold advanced 5.2 percent to C$10.46, the highest level
since May 2006. The Vancouver-based gold producer reported
fourth-quarter earnings of 15 cents a share on an adjusted

since July 2008.  Silver Wheaton added 2.7 percent to C$43.64, the highest
level since at least 1995. Profit excluding some items of 35
cents a share beat the average analyst estimate by 12 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. Silver futures for May delivery
jumped 2.9 percent.  Crude oil rose to a 29-month high on concern the unrest in  Libya  and the Middle East will curb oil supplies. Oil for April
delivery increased $2.51 percent to $104.42 a barrel in New
York, the highest settlement since September 2008.  Oil, Gas Companies  Canadian Natural,  Canada ’s second-largest energy company,
