Philippine bonds fell and the peso
gained on speculation the central bank will start raising
borrowing costs to tame inflation as early as this month.  Consumer prices rose 3.7 percent last month, according to
the median estimate of 14 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before a government report tomorrow. Inflation accelerated to
3.5 percent in January, the fastest pace in four months. Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas has less scope to maintain its benchmark
overnight borrowing rate at a record-low 4 percent, Governor
Amando Tetangco said on March 1.  “The market reading is, with the possible rate hike, peso
appreciation may be inevitable,” said Roland Avante, treasurer
at Sterling Bank of  Asia  in  Manila .  The yield on the 6.25 percent bond due January 2014 climbed
eight basis points to 5.38 percent as of 4:17 p.m., according to
Tradition Financial Services. The peso strengthened 0.4 percent
to 43.36 per dollar, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
43.353 earlier, the strongest since Feb. 21.  The central bank’s inflation estimate has “somewhat
risen” from the Feb. 10 forecast of 4.4 percent for 2011 and
3.5 percent for next year, and the numbers will be reviewed this
month, Tetangco said this week. Policy meetings in the first
half are scheduled for March 24, May 5 and June 16.  The government will cap the  budget deficit  this year at 300
billion pesos ($6.9 billion), or 3.2 percent of gross domestic
product, Finance Undersecretary Gil Beltran said in a telephone
interview today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
