Ukraine wants the European Union to
help finance a planned $10 billion upgrade of heating companies
aimed at reducing emissions.  “We need to reach European standards by 2018,” Deputy
Energy and Coal Industry Minister Mykyta Konstantinov said today
at an Adam Smith Conference in Kiev. After presenting the
emissions reduction plan, “we hope Ukraine will be able to tap
the EU’s financial resources.”  Ukraine also needs $1.5 billion to improve safety at its
nuclear  power plants  and plans to seek funding from the  European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development  and European Atomic
Energy Community, Konstantinov said. The former Soviet state has
already upgraded two reactors, he said.  Ukraine operates 15 reactors at four nuclear power plants.
A reactor at Chernobyl, the fifth plant, exploded in April 1986,
spewing radiation across Ukraine, Belarus,  Russia  and northern  Europe . The government shut down Chernobyl’s other reactors
completely in 2000.  Ukraine wants to prolong the life of the working reactors
by 20 years, Konstantinov said, without giving details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
