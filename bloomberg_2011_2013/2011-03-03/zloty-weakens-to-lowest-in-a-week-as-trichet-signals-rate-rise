The Polish zloty retreated to the
lowest level in a week after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the ECB may raise  interest rates  next
month to fight accelerating inflation pressures.  The zloty lost 0.5 percent to 3.9920 per euro as of 4:54
p.m. in Warsaw, the weakest since Feb. 24.  An “increase of interest rates in the next meeting is
possible,” Trichet told reporters in Frankfurt today after the
central bank left its key rate at a record-low 1 percent.  Trichet’s comment comes a day after his Polish counterpart  Marek Belka  said he couldn’t predict the timing of the next rate
increase and saw factors that may cool the economy in the coming
years. Poland’s slow investment and wage growth cut the risk
inflation will stay above the central bank’s 2.5 percent target,
policy makers said in a statement yesterday after leaving their
seven-day reference rate at 3.75 percent.  “Our guys are seeing more risks to growth while the ECB is
concerned about inflation,” Koon Chow, an emerging-market
currency strategist at  Barclays Capital , said by phone from  London . “If Polish policy makers continue to sound so dovish
the differences between the monetary policy will weigh on the
currency.”  Poland lifted the main rate in January, the first increase
since June 2008 to battle consumer-price growth. Inflation
exceeded the upper end of the central bank’s targeted range in
January, rising to 3.8 percent, according to data from the
statistics office on Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
