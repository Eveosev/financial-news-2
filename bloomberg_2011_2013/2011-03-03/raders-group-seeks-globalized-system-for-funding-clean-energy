  India  and other countries would be
better able to fund clean-energy projects if they could convert
domestic credits into globally recognized greenhouse gas
permits, a lobby group for traders said.  “This would promote better access to international climate
finance for  developing countries  without being overly
prescriptive in how they organize their emission reduction
efforts,” the International Emissions Trading Association said
in a submission to the  United Nations  and an e-mail today.  The system would convert various units, for instance
megawatt hours, into metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent,
allowing for international transfers, the report said. For
example, energy-saving certificates from India could be
converted into UN-overseen Certified Emission Reduction credits,
IETA said. This would help countries “develop new domestic
environmental commodity trading systems,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
