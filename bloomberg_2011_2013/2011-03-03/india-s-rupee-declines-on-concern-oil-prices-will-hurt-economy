  India ’s rupee declined for the first
time in a week on speculation surging  oil prices  will stoke
inflation and damage the country’s economy.  Crude traded near the highest level in 29 months on concern
the political turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East will
disrupt global supplies of the fuel. India imports almost 75
percent of the oil it uses. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
said the government aimed to reduce the deficit for the next
fiscal year beginning April in his budget speech this week.  “The rally on positive sentiment following the budget
announcement is over and concern of rising oil prices is back,”
said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a Mumbai-based currency trader at
Development Credit Bank Ltd.  The rupee weakened 0.2 percent to 45.04 per dollar as of
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It fell by as much as 0.3 percent earlier. The
currency has declined 0.7 percent so far this year.  The budget shortfall will ease to 4.6 percent of gross
domestic product in the 12 months through March 2012 from 5.1
percent in the current period, Mukherjee said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
