Arsenal beat Leyton Orient 5-0 to
set up an F.A. Cup quarterfinal against Manchester United, while  Manchester City  defeated Premier League soccer rival Aston Villa
3-0 to reach the last eight.  Nicklas Bendtner scored a hat trick and Marouane Chamakh
and Gael Clichy got the other goals last night as Arsenal
rebounded from its League Cup final defeat four days ago by
routing third-tier Orient in their fifth-round replay.  “It was important that we had a response after what
happened over the weekend,” Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  said
in comments on his club’s website. “We did it in a professional
way. We were always focused, we didn’t give them any chances.”  Goals from Yaya Toure,  Mario Balotelli  and  David Silva 
lifted City to the home win over Villa and into a March 13
quarterfinal against Championship team Reading, which upset
Everton 1-0 two days ago.    Manchester United , the record 11-time champion, hosts 10-
time winner Arsenal on March 12 in a matchup of the teams with
the most titles in the competition’s 139-year history.
Birmingham, which beat Arsenal 2-1 in the League Cup final,
faces Bolton the same day. Stoke hosts West Ham the day before
in the other quarterfinal.  F.A. CUP QUARTERFINAL DRAW  ==========================  Stoke              vs   West Ham  Manchester City    vs   Reading  Birmingham         vs   Bolton  Manchester United  vs   Arsenal  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
