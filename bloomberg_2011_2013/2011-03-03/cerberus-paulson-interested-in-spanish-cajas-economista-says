Cerberus Capital Management LP and
Paulson & Co. may be interested in buying stakes in Spanish
savings banks Banco Base and Mare Nostrum,  El Economista 
reported, citing unidentified people in financial markets.  John Snow, the chairman of Cerberus, visited  Madrid 
recently and showed interest in the banks but no decision to
invest will be made until March 10, when the Bank of  Spain 
provides more information on them, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
