France’s port of Rouen,  Europe ’s
biggest cereal-shipping hub, exported the most wheat to North
Africa in 14 weeks as Algeria boosted purchases amid concern
about rising food prices.  Wheat loadings for North Africa more than doubled in the
week through Feb. 23 to 159,189 metric tons, up from 68,500
tons the previous week and the most since the seven days
through Nov. 17, data from the Seine River port showed.  Rising food prices sparked protests in North Africa that
toppled leaders in  Egypt  and  Tunisia . Algeria bought 2.95
million tons of wheat from Dec. 16 to Jan. 26, probably a
record for the country, FranceAgriMer, the French crops office,
said earlier this month.  In coming weeks, “loadings will continue at this high
pace, in view of the sales that were made to  Algeria ,” said
Cedric Weber, an analyst at Bourges, France-based farm adviser
 Offre et Demande Agricole .  Rising commodity costs pushed global food prices up to a
record in January after rising 25 percent last year, according
to the  United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization .  North Africa and the Middle East are forecast to buy 39.3
million tons of wheat in the 2010-2011 marketing year,
accounting for 32 percent of world purchases, according to U.S.
Department of Agriculture data.  Egypt, the world’s largest wheat importer, bought
yesterday 120,000 tons of the grain from France as part of a
larger tender, following a purchase of 60,000 tons of French
wheat on Feb. 16. That will add to Rouen loadings in the next
several weeks and months, Weber said.  Grain Cargoes  Total outgoing grain cargoes from Rouen amounted to
194,199 tons from Feb. 17 to 23, the port said in an e-mailed
statement today. That included 170,089 tons of wheat and 24,110
tons of barley, the most in three weeks for both grains.  Morocco was Rouen’s biggest export destination in the
seven days with loadings of 81,039 tons of wheat and 6,360 tons
of barley. Algeria was the destination for 78,150 tons of
wheat, the most in nine weeks.    France ’s other main grain ports are La Pallice in the Bay
of Biscay and Dunkirk on the North Sea coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
