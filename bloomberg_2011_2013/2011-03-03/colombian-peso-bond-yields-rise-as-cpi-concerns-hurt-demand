  Colombia ’s peso bonds fell, pushing
yields higher, as speculation inflation quickened amid higher
food and gasoline prices hurt demand for the fixed-rate
securities.  The yield on the benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020
rose 3 basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.40 percent
at 11:48 a.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s stock
exchange. The bond’s price dropped 0.221 centavo to 116.355
centavos per peso.  The government’s increase in gasoline prices this month
will lead to higher consumer prices in March, according to  Camilo Perez , head analyst at Banco de Bogota SA, the nation’s
second-biggest bank. That adds to bets inflation quickened in
February as floods in the fourth quarter and a two-week truckers
strike pushed the price of farm goods higher.  “People have placed their bets on February inflation and
there is little trading in bonds as investors wait to see what
finally comes out” in the February inflation report, said
Perez.  Annual inflation quickened to 3.60 percent last month,
according to the median estimate of 19 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The national statistics agency is slated to release
the February report on March 5.  Steeper price increases damp returns on fixed-rate bonds,
prompting investors to demand higher yields. The central bank
targets inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent this year.  Colombia’s peso strengthened for a second day, gaining 0.4
percent to 1,906.15 per  U.S. dollar , from 1,913.40 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
