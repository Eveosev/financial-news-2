  Portugal  will be able to bear the
current level of  interest rates  in the near term, Secretary of
State for Treasury and Finance Carlos Costa Pina said in an
interview with Diario Economico.  “That does not mean that we should not seek to lower these
rates and we are doing that,” Costa Pina told the Portuguese
newspaper. At this moment, the implicit financing rate of the
Portuguese state with the existing stock of public debt is 3.6
percent, Costa Pina said, according to Diario.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
