Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich today said he would begin testing the waters for
seeking the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.  “We believe that it is possible to re-establish American
exceptionalism” as a core value for the U.S., he said during an
appearance in  Georgia , his home state.  Under federal election law, Gingrich, 67, can begin raising
and spending money without having to disclose his donors until
he officially declares his candidacy.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Jonathan D. Salant  in Washington at
