Britain cut aid to  Kenya  in the year
through June to 9 billion shillings ($109 million) from a
previously planned 11.2 billion shillings because of fraud at
the  Education Ministry , the  Daily Nation  reported.  The release of the funds has been pegged on the
reorganization of the police force and implementation of the
East African nation’s new constitution, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing Alistair Fernie, head of Britain’s
Department for International Development in Kenya and  Somalia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
