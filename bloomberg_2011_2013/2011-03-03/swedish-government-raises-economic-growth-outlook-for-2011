Sweden’s government raised its
forecast for economic growth this year as the largest Nordic
economy benefits from demand for its exports and after tax cuts
helped boost disposable incomes.  Gross domestic product will expand 4.8 percent this year,
compared with an October estimate for 3.7 percent growth, the  Finance Ministry  said in a statement on its website today.
Output will grow 3.5 percent in 2012, versus a previous forecast
for 3.4 percent it said. The expansion rate will ease to 3.2
percent in 2013, it said.  Sweden’s economic rebound has prompted the central bank to
raise  interest rates  five times since July. Governor Stefan Ingves said last month he may need to increase borrowing costs
at every meeting this year, and signaled individual moves may be
bigger than a quarter point, according to minutes of the Feb. 14
meeting. The pace of growth and the prospect of higher rates
have helped make the krona the best performing major currency
this year against the dollar and the euro.  Unemployment will ease to 7.4 percent this year, 6.7
percent in 2012 and drop to 4.8 percent by 2015, the government
said today. Inflation will average 2.4 percent in 2011, 1.9
percent in 2012 and 2.4 percent in 2013, it said. The central
bank targets price growth of 2 percent.  The government of Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt, which
won a second four-year term in September elections, has cut
taxes every year since 2006. The central bank raised the
benchmark repo rate a quarter point to 1.5 percent last month.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
