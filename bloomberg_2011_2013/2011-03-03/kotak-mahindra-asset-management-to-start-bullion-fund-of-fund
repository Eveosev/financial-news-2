Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co.,
an Indian money manager with $6 billion in assets, will start a
gold fund that allows investments as small as 1,000 rupees ($22)
per month.  The fund, which will invest in bullion through Kotak’s gold
exchange-traded fund, opens tomorrow and closes on March 18, the  fund manager  said today in an e-mail. It’s performance will be
benchmarked against the price of physical gold, Kotak said.  Reliance Capital Asset Management Ltd.,  India ’s top mutual
fund with assets of $23 billion at the end of December, last
month launched a gold fund-of-fund that allows investments as
small as 100 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
