  Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) , the
largest maker of generic medicines in the Southern Hemisphere,
said fiscal first-half profit jumped 31 percent as revenue from
its businesses in sub-Saharan  Africa  more than doubled.  Net income surged to 1.15 billion rand ($167 million) in
the six months through December, from 883 million rand a year
earlier, the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
distributed by the city’s stock exchange today. Sales in sub-
Saharan Africa surged to 666 million rand, as revenue at its
South African unit advanced 29 percent to 3.3 billion rand.  The performance of the company’s domestic unit in the
period ahead will be affected by the ending of an infant-milk
partnership agreement with  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  in April, which
contributed sales of about 250 million rand a year, it said.  “Pfizer has taken the decision to enter the South African
market itself following the acquisition of the infant-milk
franchise as part of its takeover of Wyeth,” said Aspen.  To replace the loss of the business, Aspen introduced its
own brand of infant milk known as Infacare Gold, according to
the statement.  Aspen gained 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, to 79.70 rand at
12:54 p.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
