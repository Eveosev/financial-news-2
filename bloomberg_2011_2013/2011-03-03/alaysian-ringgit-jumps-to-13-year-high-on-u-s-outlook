  Malaysia ’s ringgit rose toward a 13-
year high after economic reports shored up confidence in the
global recovery, brightening the outlook for exports.  The currency advanced for a fourth day in five as the  Federal Reserve ’s optimistic assessment of the  U.S. economy 
outweighed concern that political unrest in the Middle East and
North Africa would push up oil prices. Exports increased 4.5
percent in January from a year earlier, after a 4.6 percent gain
in December, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before data due tomorrow.  “The U.S. was upbeat in its economic assessment,” said
Choong Yin Pheng, manager of economic and fixed-income research
at Hong Leong Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “The ringgit is likely
to remain steady, riding on positive fundamental news.”  The ringgit appreciated 0.1 percent to 3.0335 per dollar as
of 9:18 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 3.0240 on Feb. 21, the strongest level
since October 1997. The currency may reach 2.98 by the end of
the year, Choong said.  The labor market improved throughout the U.S. early this
year, driven by rising retail sales and “solid growth” in
manufacturing, the Fed said in its Beige Book report yesterday.
Singapore’s Purchasing Managers Index, a manufacturing gauge,
rose to 52.3 in February from 50.5 in January, a report on March
1 showed.  The U.S. and  Singapore  took 24 percent of Malaysia’s
exports last year, according to the trade ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
