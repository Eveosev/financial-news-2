Vishnu Varathan, an economist at  Capital Economics    Asia ) Pte in  Singapore , comments on the
outlook for the Indian rupee.  One-month non-deliverable forwards for the currency
declined 0.1 percent to 45.26 per dollar as of 9:14 a.m. in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts
reflect bets the rupee will drop 0.6 percent from the spot rate
of 44.99.  “Post budget the rupee has strengthened because there’s a
sense that fiscal consolidation is going to gain a bit of steam.
On paper the 4.6 percent fiscal-deficit target looks very
impressive. The markets have rallied on that.  “The reality is that the budget may not deliver. The rupee
could get some hit if oil prices don’t ease. The subsidies have
to be taken out.  “The pre-budget theme for the rupee was struggling because
the story of twin deficits and rising  oil prices  didn’t help at
all.  “In the near term, the rupee will struggle to strengthen
to 44 against the dollar. Anytime it goes to 44 chances are
fears will come back and it will trade toward 45. We are
positive on the rupee in the long term, as it has to do with the
economic fundamentals and growth strength in  India .  “The euro has surged overnight and most Asian currencies
are stronger, and since the rupee is positive on the budget,
this trend will probably be underpinned today.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
