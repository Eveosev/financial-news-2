  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Beaumont,  Texas ,
refinery has restarted its fluid catalytic cracker after a Feb.
28 shutdown that followed a leak, two people familiar with the
plant’s operations said.  The unit, Beaumont’s only catalytic cracker, was restarted
the evening of March 1 and is moving toward planned rates, said
the people, who declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak for the refinery.  Kevin Allexon, a Fairfax, Virginia-based Exxon spokesman,
declined to comment, saying that Exxon doesn’t comment on day-
to-day operations.  The refinery is capable of processing 359,100 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Exxon is the largest U.S. refiner. Its  three Gulf Coast
plants  account for 17 percent of that  region’s operable  crude
oil capacity, according to the Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
