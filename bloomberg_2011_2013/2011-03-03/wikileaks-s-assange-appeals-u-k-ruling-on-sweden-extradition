Julian Assange formally appealed a
U.K. ruling that the Australia-born WikiLeaks founder should be
extradited to  Sweden  to face allegations of rape and sexual
molestation, his lawyer  Mark Stephens  said today.  The appeal, filed March 1 in the Royal Courts of Justice in
London, seeks to overturn a Feb. 24 judgment in which District
Judge Howard Riddle rejected defense claims that Assange won’t
get a fair trial in Sweden and that the prosecutor behind the
case is a “radical feminist.”  Assange was detained in December after Swedish authorities
issued a so-called European arrest warrant seeking to question
him over the claims of sexual misconduct, which two women said
took place in August. The ruling was the first round of what
lawyers said will be a long appeal process that may end up being
decided by the U.K. Supreme Court.  If Assange’s appeal were a “normal” case, the process
would take two to three months, Stephens said yesterday in a
phone interview. “There’s no good reason to rush it over any
other case, but that doesn’t mean they won’t.”  Assange, 39, remains free on bail. Stephens regularly
represents media organizations including Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
