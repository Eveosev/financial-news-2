  Israel ’s 10-year government bonds
dropped for a third day as concern escalating political unrest
will threaten the region’s stability spurred demand for safer
assets. The shekel advanced.  The yield on the benchmark notes increased to the highest
level in more than a year as Libya’s opposition leaders called
for international air strikes against Muammar Qaddafi’s forces.
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak held talks with U.S.
advisers Dennis Ross and Frederick Hoff on unrest in the Middle
East and  Africa , his office said today.  “As the turmoil in the Middle East continues with no
change in sight, investors are continuing to sell,” said Effi Cohen, a bond trader a Leader Capital Markets Ltd. “We expect
yields to remain as high and possibly rise as long as the
geopolitical situation is uncertain.”  The yield on the 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit bond due January
2020 climbed two basis points to 5.15 percent as of 1:47 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , the highest level since January 2010. The shekel
strengthened 0.4 percent to 3.6069 against the dollar. The
currency earlier appreciated to 3.6018, the strongest level
since Feb. 21.  U.S. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates  said that setting up a
no-fly zone over the north African country to prevent attacks on
regime opponents, have consequences that need to considered
carefully.  To contact the reporter on this story:
