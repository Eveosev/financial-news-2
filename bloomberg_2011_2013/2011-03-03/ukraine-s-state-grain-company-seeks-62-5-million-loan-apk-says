Ukraine’s State Food and Grain
Corporation aims to borrow $62.5 million from Ukreximbank, the
state-run export-import bank,  APK-Inform  reported without citing
anyone.  The bank will probably open a renewable  credit line  for the
company, the Dnipropetrovsk-based agriculture news agency said
on its website. The loan will be given at an annual interest
rate of 10 percent.  The government said in September it would start a state-
managed food and grain corporation, assets of which would
include elevators and bread-making complexes.  The company has the capacity to store about 3 million
metric tons of grain and oilseeds and to ship some 2.5 million
tons of grain a year, APK-Inform said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
