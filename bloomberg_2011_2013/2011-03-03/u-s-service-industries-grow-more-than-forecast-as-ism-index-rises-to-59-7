  Service industries  expanded more
than forecast in February, showing the U.S. expansion has
broadened beyond manufacturing.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses increased to 59.7, the highest level
since August 2005, from 59.4 in January. Economists forecast the
gauge would fall to 59.3, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. A reading above 50 signals growth.  A cut in payroll taxes came just in time to help Americans
cope with the jump in gasoline prices, indicating companies like  Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)  will keep benefitting from increased
spending. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  this week
signaled the central bank will forge ahead with plans aimed at
holding down  interest rates  after reiterating he’s still not
content with the strength of the recovery.  “The services sector is showing signs of a sustained
recovery,” said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at Horizon
Investments in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina . Roach forecast a
reading of 59.8. “The employment picture, in particular, is
encouraging as firms are hiring in response to increased
business activity.”  Other reports today showed  consumer confidence  held near a
three-year high last week as more Americans said their finances
were in good shape, and claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly
dropped.  Consumer Confidence  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, formerly the ABC News
U.S. Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, was minus 39.3 in the period
to Feb. 27, compared with minus 39.2 the prior week.
Respondents’ view of their financial situation climbed to an
almost two-year high.  The number of applications for unemployment insurance
payments fell by 20,000 to 368,000 in the week ended Feb. 26,
according to the Labor Department. Economists forecast claims
would climb to 395,000, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  Stocks held gains and Treasuries fell after the ISM report.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 1.2 percent to 1,324.3
at 10:41 a.m. in  New York . The yield on the benchmark 10-year
note rose to 3.52 percent from 3.47 percent late yesterday.  The Tempe, Arizona-based group’s index averaged 56.1 in the
five years to December 2007, when the last recession began. It’s
averaged 52.1 since the current recovery started in June 2009
through December, trailing the 55.4 reading on the group’s
factory measure during the same period.  The measure of new orders eased to 64.4 from 64.9 in
January, while the gauge of business activity rose to a seven-
year high of 66.9 from 64.6.  Increased Employment  The group’s employment gauge increased to 55.6, the highest
since April 2006, from 54.5 a month earlier. The index of prices
paid jumped to 73.3 from 72.1.  The ISM services survey covers industries that range from
utilities and retailing to health care, finance and
transportation. Today’s report follows the group’s March 1
figures that showed manufacturing grew in February at the
fastest pace since May 2004 as orders, exports and employment
climbed.  Following President  Barack Obama ’s agreement with Congress
in December to extend Bush-era tax cuts, Americans have more
money to spend on things besides factory-made goods. Earlier
this week a Commerce Department report showed incomes climbed 1
percent in January, the most since May 2009, after the
president’s compromise reduced the social security payroll tax
by 2 percentage points this year.  Employment Projection  Payrolls probably rose by 195,000 workers in February after
a 36,000 gain the previous month, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed before a Labor Department 4
report tomorrow.  Robert Knight, chief financial officer at Union Pacific
railroad, said last month that carloadings were up 6 percent in
the first quarter even as snowstorms depressed activity.  “We are well positioned to have another great record
year,” Knight said at a transportation services conference in
Miami on Feb. 16. “A growing U.S. economy and stronger consumer
demand is expected to play a role.”  At the same time, rising food and fuel costs may strain
household budgets. The cost of gasoline advanced 8.8 percent
last month, with regular fuel averaging $3.17 a gallon in
February, according to AAA, the nation’s largest motorist
organization. It reached $3.39 a gallon on March 1, the highest
price since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
