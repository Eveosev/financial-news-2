  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said
maintenance of its Nigerian deepwater Bonga oil and gas field,
which accounts for about 10 percent of the country’s daily
output, will last “several weeks.”  “We’re starting with a partial shutdown and then conclude
with a total shutdown,” Precious Okolobo, the company’s
spokesman in Lagos, said today in a phone interview.  The Bonga field, located 120 kilometers (75 miles) in the
Atlantic waters offshore Nigeria, has the capacity to pump about
225,000 barrels of crude and 150 million cubic feet of gas a
day, according to the company’s  website . It also supplies
natural gas to the Nigeria LNG Ltd.’s liquefaction plant on the
coastal Bonny Island that supplies long-term buyers in  Europe .  Nigeria is  Africa ’s top oil producer and the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. crude imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
