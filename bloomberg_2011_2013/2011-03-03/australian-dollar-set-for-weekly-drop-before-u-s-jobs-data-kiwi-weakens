  Australia ’s dollar dropped for the
week versus its U.S. counterpart after two consecutive five-day
gains as signs of a recovery in the U.S. labor market reduced
the yield advantage of the South Pacific nation’s bonds over
Treasuries.  “It will keep the Aussie from breaking higher at this
stage,” said Greg Gibbs, a strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in Sydney.  The Aussie slid versus the euro to the lowest level since
January on prospects the European Central Bank will raise  interest rates  faster than the  Reserve Bank  of Australia over
the next year. New Zealand’s dollar had the biggest weekly loss
in two months against the greenback as the  International
Monetary Fund  said it will likely cut the nation’s growth
forecast.  Australia’s currency fell 0.6 percent for the week and 0.3
percent today to $1.0117 at 1:04 p.m. in  New York . The Aussie
dropped 0.4 percent today to A$1.3818 per euro and earlier
touched A$1.3851, the weakest level since Jan. 28. It slid 0.5
percent to 83.24 yen, from 83.65 yesterday.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 1.9 percent for the week, the
most since the five days ended Jan. 7, and 0.5 percent today to
73.71 U.S. cents. It touched 73.39 cents today, the lowest level
since Oct. 1. The currency depreciated 0.7 percent to 60.69 yen,
from 61.09 yesterday.  Employers in the U.S. added 192,000 workers in February,
Labor Department Figures showed today in Washington, the most
since May. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly declined to 8.9
percent, the lowest level since April 2009.  Yield Gap  The difference in yields between Australian and U.S. 10-
ytear government notes touched 1.97 percentage points yesterday,
the narrowest since May. That compared with a gap of 2.12
percentage points a week ago.  The Australian dollar tumbled yesterday against the euro by
the most in three weeks after European Central Bank President
Jean-Claude Trichet said an “increase of interest rates in the
next meeting is possible.” It closed at A$1.3769 per euro, down
1 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar weakened versus most of its major
peers after the IMF said it will “likely” cut its New Zealand
growth forecast from the current 3 percent as a result of two
earthquakes there. IMF spokeswoman  Caroline Atkinson  spoke to a
news conference in  Washington  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
