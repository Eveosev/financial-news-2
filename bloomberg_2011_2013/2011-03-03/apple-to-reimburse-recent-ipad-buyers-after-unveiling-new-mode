  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , which introduced the
iPad 2 yesterday, is making $100 reimbursements available to
customers who recently bought the original model.  After unveiling the iPad 2, Apple trimmed the price of the
earlier version by $100. Under the companyâ€™s  retail store
purchase policy , when the price of a product changes, customers
who bought the device in the previous 14 days can request a
reimbursement of the difference between the prices. Customers
also can exchange it for the new model.  The first-generation device now ranges from $399 to $729,
depending on the model. The new iPad, which starts at $499, is
thinner and lighter. It also features a faster processor and
front and rear cameras.  The reimbursement policy has been in effect for other
products before the iPad announcement.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, rose $7.44 to
$359.56 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading at 4 p.m. New York time.
The shares have climbed 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
