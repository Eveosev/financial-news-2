A second civil war in  Ivory Coast ,
involving widespread violence against civilians is the “most
likely scenario in the coming months,” the International Crisis
Group said.  A repeat of the nation’s 2002-2004 conflict would risk
provoking military action by neighboring states and would send a
“massive flux of refugees” throughout the region, the
Brussels-based watchdog group said in an e-mailed statement
today.  The group is asking the five-nation panel appointed by the  African Union  to mediate Ivory Coast’s political impasse to cede
responsibility to the Economic Community of West African States,
a regional bloc that has recognized opposition leader Alassane
Ouattara as the winner of last November’s elections.  The 15-member bloc has threatened to use military
intervention to remove Ouattara’s opponent, incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo , who has defied calls by the United Nations to
step down. The UN estimates at least 315 people have died since
the election, the country’s first full vote since its civil war.  To contact the reporter on this story:
