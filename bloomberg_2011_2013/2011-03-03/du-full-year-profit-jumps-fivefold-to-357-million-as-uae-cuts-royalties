Du boosted its full-year profit
almost fivefold as the  United Arab Emirates ’ second-biggest
phone company added customers and gained from a reduction in
the government’s royalty fee.    Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Co. (DU) , as Du is
formally known, had 2010 profit of 1.31 billion dirhams
($357 million), compared with 264 million dirhams a year
earlier, it said today in a statement. Du paid 15 percent of
its earnings in royalties, down from 50 percent in 2009.
Revenue rose 33 percent to 7.1 billion dirhams.  “The most widely acknowledged success is the continued
growth of our market share,” Chairman Ahmed Bin Byat said in
the statement. The telephone company “will be advised on the
royalty rate for future years in due course,” he said.  Du, which competes with Emirates Telecommunications Corp.,
said it added 856,000 mobile phone users, bringing subscribers
to 4.3 million at the end of 2010. Du has 37 percent of the
country’s mobile market share and expects that to rise to
40 percent by the end of 2011, Chief Executive Officer Osman Sultan said Nov. 8. Fixed-line subscribers gained 38 percent to
561,000 lines in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.  The phone company’s shares retreated 1.7 percent to 2.82
dirhams in Dubai trading today, trimming their 12-month gain to
5.2 percent.  Du expects an infrastructure sharing deal with  Emirates
Telecommunications , or Etisalat, to be reached in the second
half, Sultan said in Dubai today. The company has no plans to
sell bonds, he added.  Du paid a full-year royalty fee of 184 million dirhams in
2010 compared with 264 million dirhams a year earlier. Fourth-
quarter profit after royalty was 912 million dirhams, the
company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
