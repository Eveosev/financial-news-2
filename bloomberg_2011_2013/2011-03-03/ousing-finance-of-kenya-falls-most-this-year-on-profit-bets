Housing Finance Co.,  Kenya ’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, declined the most this year on
bets investors had priced an advance in earnings into the shares
before their release.  The stock fell as much as 5.9 percent, the most since Dec.
6, to 28 shillings and traded 2.5 percent down at 29 shillings
by 2:55 p.m. in Nairobi. The shares rallied 9.4 percent in the
five days through March 1.  Net income jumped to 379.5 million shillings ($4.58
million) in the 12 months through December from 234.2 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement e-mailed by the city’s stock exchange yesterday. Net
interest income increased 22 percent to 1.15 billion shillings,
it said.  “Most of the investors had factored in the profit when
they were buying the stock so many of them have made their
returns and are now selling, that is why there is a lot of
supply,” Mercy Njoroge, an analyst at Tsavo Securities Ltd.,
said in a phone interview from Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
