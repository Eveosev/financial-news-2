Cable Holding SA said it will sell
20 million shares, almost half its stake, in  Kabel Deutschland
Holding AG (KD8)  after  Germany ’s largest cable-television operator
jumped in  Frankfurt  trading.  Goldman Sachs International will manage an accelerated book
building for an offering to institutional investors of shares
held by the funds advised by Providence Equity Partners Inc, the
bank said in an e-mailed news release today. Book building will
start immediately and will close March 4, although the books may
be closed at any time, according to the statement.  Kabel Deutschland rose 1.3 percent to close at 39.44 euros
in Frankfurt trading today, extending its gain in the last six
months to 56 percent. A sale of 20 million shares at that price
would fetch 788.8 million euros ($1.1 billion), according to
Bloomberg calculations.  Cable Holding holds 44 percent, or 39.3 million shares, of
the company based in the German town of Unterfoehring, according
to information on the cable television operator’s  website  dated
October 4.    Kabel Deutschland  said last month that fiscal third-quarter
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
soared 13 percent to 185.2 million euros as customers signed up
for more premium TV, broadband and phone services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
