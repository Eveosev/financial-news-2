  China  must focus on making macro-
economic controls more “scientific and foresighted,” Jia
Qinglin, the country’s top political adviser said today in
Beijing.  The government must properly balance maintaining steady and
rapid economic development, restructuring the economy and
managing inflation expectations, Jia will tell members of the  Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference  in Beijing
today, according to a copy of his speech.  China must maintain basic stability in the overall level of
prices and promote full employment, Jia will say, according to
the text of the speech.  China will consolidate and expand upon the achievements
that have been made in responding to the impact of the global
financial crisis, Jia will say.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
