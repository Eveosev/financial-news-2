The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options fell the most in three months as a drop in jobless
claims and growth in  service industries  bolstered confidence in
the economic recovery, and oil fell as investor concern about
Libya declined.  The VIX, as the  Chicago  Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell 10 percent to 18.60 as of 4:15 p.m. in  New
York . That’s the biggest decline since Nov. 18. The index
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which rose 1.7 percent, the
most since Dec. 1, to 1,330.97.  “Given the above-consensus economic data recently, it
seems like people are willing to sell volatility,” said Jeremy Wien, head of VIX options trading at Peak6 Capital Management
LLC in Chicago. “Certainly this could turn right back around if
oil spikes higher again, but for now, the volatility market
appears willing to accept $100 oil, as long as we keep getting
good U.S. data.”  The Labor Department today said applications for  unemployment benefits  fell by 20,000 to 368,000 in the week
ended Feb. 26. The Institute for Supply Management’s index of
non-manufacturing businesses rose to 59.7, the highest level
since August 2005, from 59.4 in January. Oil in New York fell
for the first time in three days, dropping 0.3 percent to
$101.91 a barrel in New York after  Venezuela  offered to mediate
the conflict in Libya, Africa’s largest oil producer.  “U.S. markets are currently discounting oil turmoil,”
said Dominic Salvino, a specialist at Group One Trading, the
primary market maker for VIX options. “It cannot seem to make
up its mind as to how important the Middle East unrest is.”  The VIX has averaged 17.57 so far this year. It rose as
high as 22.13 on Feb. 23 amid escalating violence in protests
against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi . The gauge’s 2011 closing
low was 15.46 on Jan. 14, reached as the  S&P 500  advanced to
what was its highest level in two years.  The most-active VIX futures were the March contracts, which
fell 6.6 percent to 19.70. May futures declined 3.4 percent to
21.65.  To contact the reporter on this story:
