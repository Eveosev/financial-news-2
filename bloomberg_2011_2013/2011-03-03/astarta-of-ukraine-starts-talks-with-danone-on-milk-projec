  Astarta Holding NV (AST) , a Ukrainian
refined sugar producer, said it started talks with  Danone (BN)  on a
joint project in milk production and processing.  A partnership with France’s Danone will allow Astarta to
make its dairy business more efficient, the Kiev-based company
said in a  statement  on its website today.  Astarta seeks to “essentially increase milk production and
to continue to improve its quality in the near future,”
according to the statement. It plans to double milk output over
five years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
