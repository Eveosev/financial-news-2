  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ’s Laurence D. Fink,
chief executive officer of the world’s largest asset manager,
said he is “more worried” about equities than he was six
months ago because of unrest in the Middle East and the
unresolved debt crisis in  Europe .  “I think the market is pausing,” Fink said today in an
interview from  New York  with Bloomberg Television’s Erik
Schatzker. “I am more worried about equities today because of
this uncertainty,” he said.  Political turmoil, which started in Tunisia more than two
months ago, has spread to countries including Oman, Bahrain and
Libya. Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index has plunged 15
percent in the past week on investor concern that protests may
extend to the Middle East’s biggest oil producer. Any
disruptions in  Saudi Arabia  could cause the prices of oil to
spike to $150 per barrel in the near term, Fink said.  “If there is uncertainty around Saudi Arabia that produces
a slowdown of oil production, we will have severe issues in the
world,” Fink said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
