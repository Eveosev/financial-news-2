(Corrects spelling of  Barack Obama  in third paragraph.)  Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak
held talks with U.S. advisers Dennis Ross and Frederick Hoff on
turmoil in the Middle East and Africa, as well as security
issues concerning the Palestinians, his office said.  “The three discussed the wide range of security issues
linked to regional developments,” according to an e-mailed
statement sent today from Barak’s Tel Aviv office. They also
reviewed “security arrangements in connection with the
Palestinians,” it said.  Ross, a senior Middle East adviser to President Barack Obama, and Hoff, deputy to the special Middle East envoy, George Mitchell, flew overnight to Israel from  Washington , said Kurt
Hoyer, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy. It was unclear when
they would meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hoyer
and Netanyahu spokesman  Mark Regev  said.  Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations stalled in September
after Israel refused to extend a 10-month partial construction
freeze in West Bank settlements. Palestinians say they won’t
negotiate while building continues.  The so-called Middle East peace Quartet, composed of the
U.S., the United Nations, the European Union and Russia, has
said new talks between Israelis and Palestinians are a priority
as political unrest sweeps through the region.  To contact the reporters on this story:
