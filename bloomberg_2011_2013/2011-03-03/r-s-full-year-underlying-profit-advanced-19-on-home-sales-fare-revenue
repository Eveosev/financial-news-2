  MTR Corp. (66) , Hong Kong’s subway
operator that gets revenue from sales of apartments above its
stations, said 2010 underlying profit rose 19 percent, as the
city’s economic growth boosted home sales and fare revenue.  Underlying profit, which excludes property valuation gains
or losses, climbed to HK$8.7 billion ($1.1 billion) for the year
ended Dec. 31, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. Net income rose to HK$12.5 billion from HK$9.9 billion
a year earlier. The average estimate of nine analysts Bloomberg
surveyed was HK$8.9 billion.  Earnings at MTR were boosted by a more than 60 percent
surge in Hong Kong’s real estate prices since the beginning of
2009. MTR, one of the biggest owners of the city’s unoccupied
residential sites, said earnings from property development rose
14 percent to HK$4 billion after selling more homes in projects
including Le Prestige at LOHAS Park and the Palazzo in Fo Tan.  “Growth in our recurrent businesses in  Hong Kong  was
strong,” MTR said in the statement. “In spite of some
uncertainties, global economic recovery should continue in
2011.”  The company sells land to developers for a cut of the
profit. With the city’s developers booking earnings from the
sale of homes before they are completed, MTR was able to
recognize its share.  About 75 percent of property profit came from the Le
Prestige development, MTR Chief Executive Officer Chow Chung Kong told reporters in Hong Kong today after the earnings. Le
Prestige, the New Territories, is jointly developed with Cheung
Kong (Holdings) Ltd.  The stock fell 0.5 percent to HK$28.65 at the close in Hong
Kong, before the earnings were released. The shares have gained
1.2 percent this year, compared with a 0.4 percent advance in
the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   Revenue Rises  MTR’s revenue climbed 57 percent to HK$29.5 billion. The
company, 76 percent owned by the Hong Kong government, will
tender five sites this year on which 11,000 residential flats
can be built, Chow said.  MTR’s income from the company’s railway operations rose to
HK$12.5 billion from HK$11.5 billion a year earlier, the company
said. Five railway links in Hong Kong are under way, Chow said.  The railway operator has expanded outside Hong Kong to
reduce its reliance on its home market. In 2009 it led a group
that won the contract to operate the suburban rail network in  Melbourne ,  Australia ’s second-biggest city. It also won a
contract to maintain two of Shenyang Metro Group Co.’s lines in
the northeastern Chinese city.  The company proposed a final dividend of 45 Hong Kong cents
a share, bringing the total payout for the year to 59 cents, up
from 52 cents a year ago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
