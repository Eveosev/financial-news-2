  Chile ’s peso appreciated more than
other major Latin American currencies as higher copper prices
and lower energy costs boosted the country’s terms of trade.  The peso gained for the first time this week, climbing 0.8
percent to 473.25 per  U.S. dollar  from 476.83 yesterday.  Copper rose in  New York  as  oil prices  fell after an offer
to mediate in  Libya ’s civil conflict. The metal is Chile’s
biggest export, while oil and gasoline are its biggest imports.  The peso gained “on stronger terms of trade and the
euro,” said Cesar Perez, an economist at Celfin Capital SA in
Santiago. “The most important thing was the euro, which moved
to $1.39 as the jobless claims came out. The euro is the biggest
benchmark traders use to indicate the movement of the peso
against the dollar because it represents the value of a whole
continent against the dollar.”  Applications for jobless benefits in the U.S. fell 20,000
to 368,000 in the week ended Feb. 26. Oil prices declined after
Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  offered to mediate in Libya’s
civil conflict.  The euro surged as European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet called for vigilance on inflation, even as the
U.S. data boosted global growth prospects.  West Texas Crude for April delivery slid 0.8 percent to
$101.42 a barrel. Turmoil in the North African country has
driven up the price of oil by 16 percent since Feb. 15, the day
before protests started in the Libyan city of Benghazi.  Chile’s central bank said it bought $50 million today at an
average of 474.2 pesos per U.S. dollar as part of a $12 billion
plan to stem the peso’s gains.  The central bank sold 26.4 billion ($55.8 million) of 10-
year bonds today at a yield of 6.71 percent, it said today on
its website. The bank sold similar bonds on Feb. 15 at a yield
of 6.9 percent.  It also sold $137 million of five-year inflation-linked
bonds at 2.45 percent, the lowest since April 2009. The bonds
were denominated in unidades de fomento, the country’s
inflation-linked accounting unit.  The bank had planned to sell 22 billion pesos of 10-year
bonds and $114 million of inflation bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
