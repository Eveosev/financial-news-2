 President  Barack Obama  said that
with the millions of dollars professional football team owners
and players are making they should be able to work out a labor
agreement on their own.  “The two parties should be able to work it out without the
president of the  United States  intervening,” Obama said in
response to a question at a White House news conference. “It
turns out I’ve got a lot of other stuff to do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
