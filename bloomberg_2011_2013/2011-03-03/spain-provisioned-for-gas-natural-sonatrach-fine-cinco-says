  Spain ’s Industry Ministry has made
provisions to cover a fine deriving from a tariff dispute
between  Gas Natural SDG SA (GAS)  and Algeria’s Sonatrach,  Cinco  Dias
reported, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the
matter.  Gas Natural, which has been ordered to pay Sonatrach 1.5
billion euros ($2.1 billion) to cover a retroactive rise in the
price of gas supplied by Sonatrach, asked the Ministry to make
the provision in 2005, the newspaper said.  The Ministry made the prevision by including a surcharge on
tariffs and the amount raised will probably cover the cost of
the economic impact of the sentence, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
