The euro climbed to four-month highs
versus the dollar and yen after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the ECB may raise  interest rates  next
month to counter accelerating inflation.  The shared currency gained against 15 of its 16 most-traded
counterparts as Trichet said an “increase of interest rates in
the next meeting is possible,” speaking in  Frankfurt  after the
central bank left its key rate at 1 percent. The dollar advanced
to a one-week high versus the yen before data tomorrow that may
show U.S. employment rose the most last month since May 2010.  “People were expecting hawkishness, but for Trichet to say
‘strong vigilance’ multiple times and allude to a potential rate
hike, that was pretty much telling right there,” said Brian Kim, a currency strategist at UBS AG in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .
“The fact that euro didn’t break $1.40 showed there was a lot
of hawkishness built in, and perhaps that people didn’t want to
push it too hard if there was a strong payroll print tomorrow.”  The euro gained 0.7 percent to $1.3969 at 5 p.m. in New
York, from $1.3866 yesterday. The shared currency traded as high
as $1.3974, matching the level on Nov. 9. It gained 1.4 percent
to 115.16 yen, the highest level since Nov. 4. The dollar
strengthened 0.7 percent to 82.45 yen, from 81.87 yesterday, and
reached 82.52 yen, matching the strongest since Feb. 24.  Oil, which surged above $100 a barrel last week for the
first time since 2008, and faster European economic growth are
fanning inflation that has already breached the ECB’s 2 percent
limit for three straight months. At the same time, officials
must weigh any rate increase against the risk it will exacerbate  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis by tightening policy too soon.  Vigilance ‘Warranted’  “Strong vigilance is warranted,” Trichet said after the
ECB meeting, adding that any rate boost would not necessarily be
the start of a “series” of moves.  Prior to today, the euro had gained 1.4 percent against its
U.S. counterpart since Feb. 21, when ECB Council member Yves Mersch said the central bank may raise its 2011 inflation
forecasts. Policy makers have kept the refinancing rate at 1
percent since May 2009.  Futures show traders added to bets on higher borrowing
costs in the region, with the implied yield on the three-month
Euribor contract expiring in December rising 0.27 percentage
point to 2.21 percent. That compares with a 40 percent chance
the  Federal Reserve  will raise U.S. interest rates from near
zero in December, according to CME Group Inc. exchange futures.  Rate Spreads  “That leads to the euro going up at least momentarily
because interest-rate spreads are very, very important in
currency valuations,” said  John Taylor , chairman of  New York- 
based FX Concepts LLC, the world’s biggest currency hedge fund,
in a Bloomberg Television interview on “In the Loop” with
Betty Liu. “Dollar interest rates are not going anywhere.”  Yields on generic Euro-area bonds maturing in one year were
109 basis points, or 1.09 percentage points, higher than those
on comparable U.S. Treasury bills, the most since January 2009,
making euro-denominated debt more attractive.  Retail sales in the euro bloc rose 0.4 percent in January
after falling 0.6 percent the prior month, the European Union
statistics office in Luxembourg said today.  The euro was the No. 1 performer over the past week in a
basket of 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, gaining 0.8 percent. The dollar
fell 0.5 percent.  U.S. nonfarm payrolls added 196,000 jobs in February,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 84
economists before the Labor Department reports the data
tomorrow. The total for January was 36,000.  Initial jobless-benefits claims unexpectedly fell last week
to the lowest since May 2008, 368,000, department data showed.  Brazilian Real    Brazil ’s real jumped 0.5 percent to 1.6493 per dollar after
the central bank raised its benchmark rate yesterday for a
second straight meeting and signaled it may do the same next
month. The rate went to 11.75 percent, from 11.25 percent.  The Norwegian krone declined versus most of its major peers
as crude oil for April delivery fell as much as 2 percent in  New
York , its first loss in three days. The  Arab League  said it’s
holding discussions with  Venezuela  about mediating the uprising
in  Libya ,  Africa ’s third-largest oil producer. Crude later
traded at $101.89 a barrel, down 0.3 percent.  The krone depreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar to
5.5642. Earlier it reached its strongest since October 2009,
5.5403, as oil traded near last week’s two-year highs. Norway is
the world’s seventh-biggest oil exporter.  Rand Drops    South Africa ’s rand depreciated the most in more than a
week against the dollar as gold fell from a near-record high on
speculation Libyan turbulence will end. The currency weakened as
much as 0.8 percent to 6.9339 per dollar, the biggest intraday
decline since Feb. 22. Gold and platinum account for a fifth of
the country’s exports.  The Swiss franc declined for a second day against the euro,
losing as much as 1.7 percent to 1.3022, the weakest level since
Feb. 17. It lost 0.9 percent to 93.18 centimes per dollar.  Nomura Holdings Inc. exited a losing bet that the euro
would rise against the franc on concern further gains will be
limited after Trichet’s comments today.  “There’s no doubt that it was a pretty clear statement
Trichet was making, but we have to look what’s priced in now,”
said  Jens Nordvig , managing director of currency research at
Nomura in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
