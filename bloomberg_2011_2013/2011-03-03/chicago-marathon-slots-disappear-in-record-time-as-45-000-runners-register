Registration for the  Chicago
Marathon  closed today in record time after 45,000 runners signed
up in 31 days, three weeks faster than the previous mark,
organizers said.  The 34th annual race, which covers 26.2 miles and begins
and ends in the city’s Grant Park area, will be run on Oct. 9.  The Chicago course, known for speed due to cooler
temperatures and flat terrain, attracts runners seeking to set
personal records or qualify for the  Boston Marathon .  Last month, the Boston Athletic Association, which stages
the world’s oldest annual marathon, announced that it would drop
 qualifying times  for the race by five minutes, beginning in
2013, and alter its registration process for 2012. This year’s
Boston Marathon sold out in eight hours, leading to the changes.  Kenya’s Sammy Wanjiru set the U.S. marathon record in  Chicago  in 2009 with a time of 2 hours, 5 minutes, 41 seconds.
Wanjiru also won the 2010 race in 2:06:24.  The Chicago Marathon, sponsored by Bank of America Corp.,
is one of the five World  Marathon Majors .  To contact the reporter on this story:
