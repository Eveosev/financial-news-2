Japanese bonds fell for a second day
before a U.S. report that economists said will show job gains
increased last month, damping demand for the safety of debt.  Ten-year debt posted its biggest weekly drop in a month as
Japanese stocks extended a rally in shares around the world on
optimism the global recovery is gaining momentum. Ten-year
futures dropped for the fifth time in six days after a separate
U.S. report yesterday showed initial jobless claims unexpectedly
declined last week.  “With the  U.S. economy  not in a bad shape, the downside
risk to Japan’s economy is reduced,” said  Ayako Sera , a
strategist in Tokyo at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co., which
manages about $331 billion in investments. “The chance that
Japanese bond yields will fall has decreased.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose one basis
point to 1.295 percent as of 3:36 p.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The
1.3 percent security due March 2021 lost 0.088 yen to 100.044
yen. The yield climbed 5.5 basis points this week, the most
since the period ended Feb. 4.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery slipped 0.19 to
139.35 at the 3 p.m. close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The
contracts have fallen 0.24 this week.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained for a second day,
adding 1 percent, after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed
1.7 percent in  New York  yesterday.  U.S. employers hired 196,000 workers last month, the most
since May, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists
before today’s report. The Labor Department said yesterday that
applications for  unemployment benefits  dropped by 20,000 to
368,000 last week.  ‘Unfavorable’ for Bonds  “The environment is unfavorable for Japanese bonds,”  Kazuhiko Sano , chief strategist at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co.,
wrote in a note to clients today. “The  bond market  will
continue to fall.”  Japan’s government bonds have handed investors a loss of
0.9 percent this year, according to an index compiled by Merrill
Lynch & Co. This compares with a 2.4 percent gain in 2010.  Ten-year yields may climb to 1.6 percent and investors
should reduce the duration of their portfolios, according to
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc. Duration is a gauge of how much a
change in yield affects a bond’s price.  “The risk of the market collapsing to this level, even if
temporarily, is steadily rising,”  Akito Fukunaga , chief rates
strategist at the brokerage unit of RBS in Tokyo, wrote in a
note today to clients. “Investors should not buy on dips when
the 10-year rate reaches 1.35 percent, the top end of the range
up until now,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
