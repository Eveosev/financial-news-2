Oil production in northern  Sudan 
will climb to 200,000 barrels per day by the end of 2012, the
state minister for oil, Ali Ahmed Osman said, according to
state-run SUNA news agency.  Production will rise to 125,000 barrels per day by the end
of this year and to 325,000 barrels per day by the end of 2016,
Osman said, the news agency reported yesterday. Oilfields in
northern Sudan currently produce 110,000 barrels per day, he
said on Jan. 6.  About three-quarters of Sudan’s current oil output of
490,000 barrels a day is produced in Southern Sudan, which is
scheduled to become independent in July. The crude is pumped
mainly by China National Petroleum Corp.,  Malaysia ’s Petroliam
Nasional Bhd. and  India ’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp. Sudan had five
billion barrels of proven oil reserves as of January 2010,
according to the  U.S. Energy Information Administration .  Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir ordered the oil ministry
to expand its exploration efforts in the north, SUNA reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
