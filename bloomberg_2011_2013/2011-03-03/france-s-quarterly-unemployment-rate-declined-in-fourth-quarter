  France ’s  unemployment rate  declined
in the fourth quarter of last year as employers resumed hiring
more than a year after the country exited its worst recession
since World War II.  The jobless rate dropped to 9.6 percent in the three months
through December after a revised 9.8 percent in the third
quarter, national statistics institute Insee said in an e-mailed
statement from Paris today. Economists expected a rate of 9.7
percent, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The unemployment rate has declined from a peak of 10
percent at the end of last year as companies ranging from car
manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroen to cosmetics maker L’Oreal SA
began hiring. Even so, the limited gains highlight concerns
about the strength of the rebound at a time when President
Nicolas Sarkozy’s government is squeezing expenses and the
global recovery is slowing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
