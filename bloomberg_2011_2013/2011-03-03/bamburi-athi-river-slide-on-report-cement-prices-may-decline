Bamburi Cement Co. retreated the
most in two months and  Athi River Mining Ltd. (ARML)  snapped two days
of gains after a report said the price of cement may decline by
as much as 10 percent this year.  Bamburi, the local unit of  Lafarge SA (LG) , the world’s biggest
cement maker, slid 3.6 percent to 190 shillings, the biggest
drop since Jan. 6., by the 3 p.m. close of trading in Nairobi.
Athi,  Kenya ’s third-largest cement maker, declined 0.6 percent
to 182 shillings.  Cement prices in Kenya may fall as much as 10 percent this
year because of increased competition,  Business Daily  reported
today. Wholesale prices for a 50 kilogram (110 pound) bag of
cement dropped 9.1 percent in December, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said. Further price declines may reduce cement
companies’ profits, the paper said, citing East African Portland
Cement Co. Chief Executive Officer Kephar Tande and Athi River
Mining Ltd. Managing Director Pradeep Paunrana.  East African shares were unchanged at 102 shillings today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
