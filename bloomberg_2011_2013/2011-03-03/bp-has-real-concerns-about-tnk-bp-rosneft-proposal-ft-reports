BP Plc said it has “real financial,
practical and strategic concerns” about a proposal by TNK-BP to
buy a 5 percent stake in BP and trade it for 10 percent of  Rosneft Oil Co. (ROSN) , the FT said.  The Russian partners in TNK-BP and BP are to meet in Berlin
tomorrow to discuss the issue before arbitration hearings begin
in  London  on March 7, the FT said.  Rosneft is unlikely to agree to the proposal, and “does
not view TNK-BP as a possible participant in the strategic
alliance with BP on the Arctic shelf,” the newspaper cited
Rosneft President Eduard Khudainatov as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
