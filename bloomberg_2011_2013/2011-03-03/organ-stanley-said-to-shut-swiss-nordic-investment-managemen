  Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, plans to shut its Swiss and Nordic
investment-management units as part of a plan to boost earnings
from the division, two people with knowledge of the matter said.  The closure of the Zurich and Stockholm offices will affect
six employees, said one of the people, who declined to be
identified because the plans are confidential. Teams in the U.K.
and  Italy  will cover existing clients in the affected regions,
the people said.  Greg Fleming, who became head of  Morgan Stanley Investment
Management  last year, said in November that the unit’s sales
efforts have been “ineffective.” Since then, he installed
Navtej Nandra as head of the division’s international operations
and Paul Price as head of international sales.  “We continually evaluate our global distribution strategy
across regions and products to ensure that we are delivering
best-in-class service to clients in our key markets,” Morgan
Stanley spokesman Hugh Fraser said in an e-mail today.  Morgan Stanley’s core asset management revenue fell 2
percent in 2010, while a rebound in merchant banking, including
$431 million in gains from real estate funds, helped the unit to
return to profit after two years of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
