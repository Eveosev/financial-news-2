Mexican President Felipe Calderon
and U.S. President  Barack Obama  announced a plan to resolve a
dispute over Mexican trucks crossing the border to operate in
the U.S.  “We finally have found a clear path to resolve the dispute
over trucking between our two countries,” Obama said at a news
conference with Calderon at the White House.  The agreement will require approval from Congress. Under
the plan, as outlined by U.S. and Mexican officials, Mexican
trucks will have to meet U.S. safety standards.  Under the agreement, the U.S. would phase in a program
letting Mexican trucks operate in the U.S., and  Mexico  will
suspend its retaliatory tariffs on American products such as
pork, ketchup, cheese, corn and fruits. Half the tariffs will be
lifted immediately, and the remainder once the first Mexican
truck is allowed to enter the U.S..  To contact the reporter on this story:
