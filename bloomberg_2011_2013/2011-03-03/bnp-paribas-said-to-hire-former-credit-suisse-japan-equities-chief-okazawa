  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA,  Europe ’s biggest
bank, will hire Kyoya Okazawa, former head of Japan equities at  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , to expand its equity business, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Okazawa, 40, who resigned as managing director at Credit
Suisse late last year, will start at BNP Paribas in Tokyo as
early as next week, said the people who declined to be
identified because he hasn’t joined yet. The bank hasn’t decided
his official position in the equities department, they said.  Paris-based BNP Paribas has been boosting equity sales,
research and trading in Japan since last April, when it hired
about 20 staff from  KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s Tokyo-based unit. Japan’s
benchmark Topix stock index has climbed 5 percent this year on
signs that the economic recovery is picking up.  BNP Paribas Securities (Japan) Ltd. opened its Tokyo branch
in 1987 and employed 532 people as of July, according to its
website. The bank didn’t offer equity research services for
major industries as of March 2010, Bloomberg data show.  BNP Paribas’ spokesman Toru Ichikawa declined to comment.  Okazawa joined Credit Suisse in 2001 as the head of
international equity sales. He previously worked at  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s
Japanese brokerage unit in 1993 after graduating from  Keio
University .  To contact the reporters on this story:
