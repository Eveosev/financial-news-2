The Indian government, which
expected to raise 25 billion rupees ($555 million) in its first
year from a carbon tax on coal, failed to disclose how it will
spend the money, a solar industry group said.  The proceeds from the coal tax, which took effect last
July, were meant to fund renewable energy technologies, Anil
Lakhina, managing director of the Gurgaon-based Forum for
Advancement of Solar Thermal, said today in an e-mail. The
government has yet to consult companies on how the fund will be
used or its terms, he said.  “The fund needs to be activated at the earliest with
express earmarking of certain portion for meeting the debt
funding requirements of solar projects,” Lakhina said.  The tax was  India ’s first step to charge companies for
fossil fuel pollution. Imported and domestically mined coal,
which fires more than half of the nation’s electricity
generation, is taxed at 50 rupees a metric ton. Coal producers
are required to pay the tax on a monthly basis, according to  Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the nation’s largest producer.  The government hasn’t specified how much it has raised or
how the funds will be used since announcing the tax in February
2010. Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee proposed this week to
use part 2 billion rupees from the collections to clean up
polluted lakes and rivers but didn’t elaborate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
