Joining the euro currency will only
be interesting for  Hungary  by 2020 and once the country has
reduced its debt to 50 percent of gross domestic product,
Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  was quoted as saying today.  Asked in an interview published in Austrian daily newspaper
Der Standard today whether the euro was still interesting for
Hungary at all, Matolcsy replied: "2020."  "We want to meet the Maastricht criteria first, but we also
want to achieve real convergence in terms of government debt,
employment and growth," he added, according to the Vienna-based
newspaper. "Once the government debt level reaches 50 percent of
output, we’ll join."  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
