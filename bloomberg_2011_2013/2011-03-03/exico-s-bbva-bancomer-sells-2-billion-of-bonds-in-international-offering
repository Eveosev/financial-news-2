Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer SA,
the Mexican unit of  Spain ’s second-largest bank, sold $2 billion
of bonds, matching the country’s largest corporate bond
offering.  The bank said in a statement that it sold $750 million of
five-year notes to yield 237 basis points, or 2.37 percentage
points, more than similar-maturity  U.S. Treasuries , and $1.25
billion of 10-year bonds at a spread of 312 basis points.  The sale is the country’s largest since  Petroleos Mexicanos 
sold $2 billion of notes in July, and also equals issues by
America Movil SAB in March 2010 and Pemex in 2009, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The issue will allow the bank to “consolidate and further
strengthen its liquidity and capital position,” the statement
said.  BBVA said in an e-mailed statement to the  Mexico  stock
exchange on Feb. 21 that it plans to sell as much as 60 billion
pesos ($5 billion) of debt in Mexico during the next five years.
The bank last issued debt in January, selling 5 billion pesos of
floating rate bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
