Estonia’s ruling Reform Party has
kept its lead in polls over opposition Center Party ahead of the
March 6 general elections, a poll commissioned by  Eesti
Paeevaleht  showed.  Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip ’s Reform received backing from
30 percent of respondents, followed by the the Center Party of
Tallinn Mayor Edgar Savisaar with 22 percent and Ansip’s
coalition ally, Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit of former Prime
Minister Mart Laar, with 20 percent, Paeevaleht reported, citing
a survey of 508 eligible voters by pollster Faktum & Ariko
between Feb. 23 to 28. Support for the Social Democrats was at
13 percent, it added. No margin of error was given.  The poll results would translate into 57 seats for the
coalition in the 101-member Riigikogu, the newspaper said. The
coalition now has a 51-seat majority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
