Spot gasoline in the  Gulf Coast 
advanced versus futures after ConocoPhillips reported a process
upset at a Borger, Texas, plant and Exxon Mobil Corp. was said
to have shut a fluid catalytic cracker at the Beaumont refinery.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 2.5 cents to 16 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:13 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
0.07 cent to $2.8452 a gallon.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the Gulf Coast
widened 0.12 cent to 4 cents a gallon.  The only catalytic cracker at the 359,000-barrel-a-day
Exxon plant restarted March 1, after shutting Feb. 28 because of
a leak, two people familiar with the plant’s operations said.
The unit is moving toward planned rates, according to the
people, who declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak for the refinery.  Emissions associated with the upset in a fluid catalytic
cracking unit at the Borger refinery began at 2 p.m. local time
yesterday and lasted six minutes, Houston-based  ConocoPhillips (COP) 
said in a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
