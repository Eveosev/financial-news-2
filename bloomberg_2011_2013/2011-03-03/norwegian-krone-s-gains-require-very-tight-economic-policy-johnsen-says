  Norway ’s government will conduct
“very” tight economic policy to curb any appreciation of the
krone that threatens the Nordic country’s competitiveness,
Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen said.  “Of course we are concerned about the competitiveness of
Norwegian business,” Johnsen said in an interview in Oslo
today. Norway needs a “very restrictive finance policy; this is
our contribution to not putting extra pressure on the
currency,” he said.  The krone yesterday jumped to a four-year high versus the
euro and was the best performing major currency against the
dollar, the euro and the yen last month as political unrest in
the Middle East intensified and oil touched $100 a barrel.
Norway, the world’s seventh-biggest oil exporter, funnels
revenue from energy exports into the world’s second-largest
sovereign-wealth fund in an effort to prevent the economy from
overheating.  A key government concern is shaping fiscal policy to avoid
putting more pressure on the central bank to raise  interest
rates , Johnsen said.  Oslo-based Norges Bank, which last raised the overnight
deposit rate in May bringing it to 2 percent, has signaled it
will resume tightening by the middle of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
