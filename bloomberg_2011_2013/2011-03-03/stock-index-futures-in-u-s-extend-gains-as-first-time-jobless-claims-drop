U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains, signaling the market may advance for a second day, after
an unexpected decrease in jobless claims bolstered confidence in
the labor market.  March contracts on the  S&P 500  rallied 1.1 percent to 1,320
at 8:31 a.m. in New York. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures
gained 1.1 percent to 12,150 and Nasdaq-100 Index futures
increased 1 percent to 2,346.25.  Applications for  unemployment benefits  decreased by 20,000
to 368,000 in the week ended Feb. 26, Labor Department figures
showed today. Economists forecast claims would climb to 395,000,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. The
total number of people receiving  unemployment insurance  fell to
the lowest level since October 2008.  The S&P 500 has climbed 93 percent from a 12-year low in
March 2009 as government stimulus measures, improving profits
and increased takeovers bolstered confidence in equities. Per-
share profit topped analysts’ estimates at 71 percent of the 468
companies in the gauge that have reported results since Jan. 10,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing
gauge may show that the economic recovery has broadened beyond
manufacturing, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Economists
forecast that the measure was little changed at 59.3 in February
after a 59.4 reading in January that was the highest since 2005.
The ISM will publish its report at 10 a.m. New York time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
