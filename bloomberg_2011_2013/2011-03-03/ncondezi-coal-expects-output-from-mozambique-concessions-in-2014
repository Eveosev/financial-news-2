Ncondezi Coal Co. may start
producing at two concessions in  Mozambique ’s northwestern Tete
province in the second half of 2014, said Nigel Walls, its chief
operating officer.  A feasibility study will be completed by July next year,
Walls said in an e-mailed response to questions today. Ncondezi
is doing drilling to test the quality of the coal, he said.  If the study “is positive and subject to financing, then
we should be in a position to start production during the latter
part of 2014,” Walls said.  Ncondezi has four concessions in the region, where  Vale SA (VALE5) ,
the world’s biggest iron ore exporter, and  Riversdale Mining
Ltd. (RIV)  also operate. Riversdale plans to start producing coal from
its Zambeze project in Tete province in 2014, David West, the
Australian company’s principal geologist in Mozambique, said
today. Mozambique expects to start exporting coal from July,
according to Mineral Resources Minister Esperanca Bias.  The two concessions Ncondezi are studying have a combined
potential of 1.8 billion tons, according to a document e-mailed
by Walls.  “A scoping study based on previous drilling and test work
was completed in April 2010 and confirmed the economic viability
of a 10 million ton per annum export thermal coal operation with
potential for coking coal,” Walls said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
