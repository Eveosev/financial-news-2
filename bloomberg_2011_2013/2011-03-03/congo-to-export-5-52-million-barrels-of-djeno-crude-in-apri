The Republic of Congo plans to ship
5.52 million barrels of Djeno crude in April, unchanged from
March, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The April shipment program comprises six cargoes of 920,000
barrels each, according to the plan.  The export plan of N’Kossa grade has yet to be released.    Total SA (FP) ,  France ’s largest oil producer, operates the two
fields in Congo. The crudes are sweet, or have low sulfur
content. N’Kossa is a lighter grade than Djeno and yields more
lucrative fuels such as gasoline and diesel when processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
