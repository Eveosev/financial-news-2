One of the two tankers bound from  Libya  that were anchored off the U.S. Gulf Coast moved into
Texas’s Sabine Pass, according to Bloomberg ship tracking data.  The ship, Torm Ugland, was last seen near Port Neches,
Texas, according to the data. The tanker was anchored off  Port
Arthur , Texas, yesterday.  The other tanker, Hellespont Progress, is still anchored
off the Gulf Coast.  Torm Ugland, which can carry as much as 73,708 metric tons
of oil products, left Libya’s Mellitah Terminal, a crude and
condensate port west of the nation’s capital, Tripoli, on Feb.
7. Hellespont Progress left the same port around Jan. 30.  Transactions with Libya are subject to oversight by the
Treasury Department’s  Office of Foreign Assets Control  since
U.S. President  Barack Obama  signed an executive order imposing
sanctions as of 8 p.m. Washington time on Feb. 25.  To contact the reporters on this story:
