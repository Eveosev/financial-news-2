The rand depreciated the most in
more than a week against the dollar as gold fell from a near-
record high on speculation turbulence in  Libya  may end.  South Africa’s currency weakened 0.7 percent to 6.9216 per
dollar, the biggest intraday decline since Feb. 22 by 5:49 p.m.
in Johannesburg. Earlier it strengthened as much as 0.3 percent,
the highest in more than six weeks. Against the euro, the rand
declined 1.1 percent to 9.6452.  Gold, which with platinum accounts for about a fifth of
South Africa’s export revenue, fell for the first day in five,
as much as 1.2 percent, before trading down 0.9 percent to
$1,421.65 an ounce after the  Arab League  said it is holding
discussions with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to intervene
in Libya’s civil crisis. Gold reached a record $1,440.32 an
ounce yesterday.  “The relationship between the rand and gold is still
positive, which means that the rand still tends to” weaken in
response to a lower gold price, Standard Bank Group Ltd.
analysts, including Johannesburg-based Michael Keenan, wrote in
a note to clients today.  Government bonds fell, with the 13.5 percent security due
September 2015 losing 34 cents to 121.484 rand. The yield
increased 7.6 basis points to 7.77 percent.  The  European Central Bank  kept its benchmark interest rate
at a record low of 1 percent when it announced its decision at
1:45 p.m. in  Frankfurt  today, as predicted by all 53 economists
in a Bloomberg survey. That compares with South Africa’s 5.5
percent main interest rate.  EBC President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said the ECB may raise  interest rates  next month to fight accelerating inflation
pressures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
