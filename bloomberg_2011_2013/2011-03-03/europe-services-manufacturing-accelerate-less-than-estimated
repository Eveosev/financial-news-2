Growth in  Europe ’s services and
manufacturing industries accelerated less than initially
estimated in February.  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in the 17-nation euro region in both industries rose to
58.2 from 57 in January, London-based Markit Economics said
today. That’s below an initial estimate of 58.4 released on Feb.
21. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “These data suggest that the economy is growing at a
quarterly rate of around 0.8 percent in the first quarter,
representing a marked upturn from the slowdown in the GDP data
seen in the second half of last year,”  Chris Williamson , chief
economist at Markit, said in today’s report. “It is encouraging
to see that surging output growth in manufacturing is being
accompanied by a gathering rate of expansion in the service
sector.”  A gauge of services advanced to 56.8 in February from 55.9
in the previous month, Markit said. An indicator of
manufacturing increased to 59 from 57.3 in January, it said on
March 1. Estonia joined the euro region this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
