The U.S. Energy Department offered
project developers Wagner Wind Energy and Independence Wind LLC
a conditional commitment for a $102 million loan guarantee for a
wind farm they are planning near Roxbury,  Maine .  The project is expected to connect to new transmission
lines to provide power to Central Maine Power Co., the local
utility, the Energy Department said today in a  statement .  The 50.6-megawatt Record Hill project, sponsored by the
Yale University Endowment fund, will have 22 turbines with
capacity of 2.3 megawatts each, from  Siemens AG (SIE) , according to
the statement.  “Record Hill introduces an innovative technology to the
U.S. that will boost domestic wind generation and help us reach
President Obama’s goal of doubling clean energy produced in
America by 2035,” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in the
statement.  The turbines feature a system of sensors and processing
software that allow them to continue to generate electricity
under turbulent conditions and with reduced wear and tear.  The Energy Department’s loan guarantee program has issued
or offered conditional commitments totaling almost $18 billion
to 20 clean energy projects, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
