Third-seeded  Andy Murray  swept into
the men’s final at the U.S. Open with a blustery four-set
victory today against No. 6 Tomas Berdych that was delayed by
rain and then bedeviled by gusting wind.  Murray, 25, of Britain will play his second U.S. Open
tennis final against either defending champion and second seed
Novak Djokovic of Serbia or No. 4 David Ferrer of Spain. Murray,
who defeated Berdych, 26, of the Czech Republic 5-7, 6-2, 6-1,
7-6 (9-7), was runnerup to Switzerland’s Roger Federer in 2008.  The women’s final between top-seeded Victoria Azarenka of
Belarus and three-time champion  Serena Williams  of the U.S. was
postponed to tomorrow because of bad weather expected this
evening.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
