The U.S. Open tennis championship
men’s semifinal between Andy Murray, the No. 3 seed from
Britain, and Tomas Berdych, the sixth seed from the Czech
Republic, began after a rain delay of more than an hour.  There’s an 80 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms
both this afternoon and tonight at the National Tennis Center in
New York, according to the National Weather Service.  Novak Djokovic, the defending champion from Serbia who is
seeded No. 2, is scheduled to take on fourth-seeded David Ferrer
of Spain in the other men’s semifinal this afternoon.  Serena Williams , the No. 4 seed from the U.S., plays top-
seeded  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus in the women’s final
tonight.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
