Jones  may miss up to two months after having surgery to repair
torn knee cartilage.  Jones suffered the injury in training this week and will
need six to eight weeks of rehabilitation, United said on its
website. The 20-year-old has yet to play this season after
injuring his back on the Reds’ summer tour.  United hosts Wigan in its next Premier League match on
Sept. 15.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
