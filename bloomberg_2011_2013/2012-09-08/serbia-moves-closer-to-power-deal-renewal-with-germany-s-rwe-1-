The Serbian government approved the
signing of an agreement between state-owned Elektroprivreda
Srbije and German utility  RWE AG (RWE)  as it seeks to increase power
production capacity.  The decision allows Energy Minister Zorana Mihajlovic to
sign the Memorandum of Understanding and Strategic Partnership
with RWE in Berlin next week, Dejan Milekovic, spokesman for the
minister, said in a phone interview. The deal will “ensure
stable and continued growth of the energy sector in Serbia,”
the government’s press office said in an e-mailed statement.  RWE’s investment through a joint venture with
Elektroprivreda may exceed 2.2 billion euros ($2.82 billion),
the Tanjug news agency reported, citing Deputy Premier
Aleksandar Vucic, who will also travel to Berlin next week. That
will include 1.2 billion euros to add a third unit to Serbia’s
lignite-fired Termoelektrana Nikola Tesla B plant, and about 1
billion euros in hydropower plants on the River Morava and the
River Drina.  Serbia  seeks to lure foreign investment to pull its economy
out of recession, narrow its current-account deficit and become
self-sufficient in power production.  Serbia would repay RWE “not in cash but through green
energy” and the arrangement may also include construction of
pumped-storage Djerdap 3 hydro plant on the Danube River, Vucic
told Tanjug without elaborating.  RWE and Elektroprivreda signed a preliminary agreement in
2009 that was to add as much as 3,000 megawatts of hydropower
capacity in the Balkan country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
