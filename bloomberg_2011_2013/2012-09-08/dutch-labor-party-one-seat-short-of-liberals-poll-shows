The Dutch  Labor Party  is just one
seat short of the Liberal Party as it continues to gain in
support, a poll by Maurice de Hond published last night ahead of
Sept. 12 elections showed.  Labor would get 32 seats if elections were held today,
compared with 30 on Sept. 6, the survey showed. Prime Minister
 Mark Rutte â€™s Liberals stood unchanged at 33 seats and the
Socialist Party would get 23 seats, according to the poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
