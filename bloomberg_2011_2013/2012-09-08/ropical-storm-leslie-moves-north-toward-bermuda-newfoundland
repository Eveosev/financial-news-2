Tropical Storm Leslie is moving
north in the Atlantic Ocean toward  Bermuda  and Newfoundland.  Leslie is advancing at 3 miles per hour (6 kilometers per
hour) and will pass east of Bermuda tomorrow, arriving in the
Newfoundland area by the middle of next week, the National
Hurricane Center said in an advisory at 2 a.m. Atlantic Standard
Time.  Swells generated by Leslie are affecting Bermuda and the
U.S. East Coast north of  Central Florida  and could cause life-
threatening surf, it said. The storm had maximum sustained winds
of 65 mph, unchanged from the last update from the center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
