Ethiopia ’s government has held peace
talks with the Ogaden National Liberation Front, an outlawed
ethnic-Somali rebel group, Communications Minister Bereket Simon
said.  “It’s a very positive step and we will pursue negotiations
up to the last and try to bring all concerned in that area to
the constitutional framework,” Bereket said in a phone
interview from the capital, Addis Ababa, today.  Proposals to end the conflict in the Ogaden area of
Ethiopia’s Somali regional state were agreed during initial
talks on Sept. 6 and Sept. 7 in Nairobi, the rebel group said in
an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
