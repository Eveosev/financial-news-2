The U.S. has invited Egyptian
President Mohamed Mursi to  Washington  in December following the
 U.S. presidential election  in November, the state-run Middle
East News Agency reported, citing Yasser Ali, Mursi’s spokesman.  Pooja Jhunjhunwala, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman,
declined to comment about whether the invitation had been
extended.  Mursi’s visit to  New York  on Sept. 23 won’t include a trip
to Washington, Ali said, according to MENA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
