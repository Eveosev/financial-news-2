A committee of Chilean government
ministers approved two coal-fired power stations to be built in
the northern part of the country, La Tercera reported, citing
Environment Minister Maria Ignacia Benitez.  The two power stations, South Cross Group’s Pacifico and
Americas Energy Fund’s Patache, would together add about 460
megawatts to  Chile ’s northern electricity grid, the newspaper
