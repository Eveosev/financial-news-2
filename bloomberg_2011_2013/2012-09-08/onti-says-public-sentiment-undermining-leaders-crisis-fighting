Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said euro-skepticism among voters is undermining the progress
leaders have made fighting the sovereign debt crisis.  “It’s paradoxical and sad,” Monti said today in
Cernobbio,  Italy , in a statement to reporters. “One can’t help
note a growing and dangerous sentiment of antagonism in member
states.”  The three-year crisis has taken its toll on voters from
Greece to Paris and produced a surge in popularity for
politicians who oppose European integration. In Italy, Monti’s
parliamentary coalition has lost ground in opinion polls to
euro-skeptic comedian Beppe Grillo, even as the prime minister’s
policies helped lower the country’s borrowing costs.  “Just when we hoped to complete the integration both at a
psychological level and in the public opinion -- so eventually
at the political level -- we are rather witnessing the opposite
trend,” said Monti as he stood next to European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy . Monti cited, “a number of conflicts aiming
at disintegration in almost all member states.”  Monti proposed holding a summit in  Rome  by next year to
discuss the threat posed by public sentiment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
