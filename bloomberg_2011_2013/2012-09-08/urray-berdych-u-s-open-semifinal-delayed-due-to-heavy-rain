Rain has delayed the U.S. Open
tennis championship semifinal between Andy Murray, the No. 3
seed from Britain, and Tomas Berdych, the No. 6 seed from the
Czech Republic.  There’s an 80 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms
both this afternoon and tonight at the National Tennis Center in
New York, according to the National Weather Service.  Novak Djokovic, the defending champion from Serbia who is
seeded No. 2, is scheduled to take on fourth-seeded David Ferrer
of Spain in the other men’s semifinal this afternoon.  Serena Williams , the No. 4 seed from the U.S., plays top-
seeded  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus in the women’s final
tonight.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
