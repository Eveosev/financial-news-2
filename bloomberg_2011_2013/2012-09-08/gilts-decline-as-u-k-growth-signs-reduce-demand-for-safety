U.K. government bonds fell this
week, with yields climbing to the highest level in two months,
as signs the economy is emerging from recession reduced demand
for safer investments.  Gilts dropped for the first time in three weeks as data
showed U.K. industrial production rose the most in 25 years and
indexes of services and manufacturing activity both beat
economists’ forecasts. U.K. government securities also declined
as the  European Central Bank  said it would buy euro-area bonds
to help contain the region’s debt crisis. The pound fell for a
fourth week against the euro.  “There’s been slightly better activity data, which is
negative for gilts,” said Jason Simpson, an interest-rate
strategist at Banco Santander SA in  London . “The ECB bond-
buying plan has also triggered a risk-on move, which has further
undermined gilts.”  The yield on the 30-year bond climbed eight basis points,
or 0.08 percentage point, this week to 3.03 percent at 5 p.m. in
London yesterday after rising to 3.14 percent, the highest level
since July 5. The 4.5 percent bond due in December 2042 fell
1.975, or 19.75 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 129.05.  The change in 10-year gilt yields was distorted as the U.K.
switched to a new benchmark bond during the week.  Industrial production rose 2.9 percent in July, the most
since February 1987, after falling 2.4 percent in June, the
 Office for National Statistics  said yesterday. An index based on
a survey of purchasing managers in the services industry climbed
to 53.7 in August, Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute
of Purchasing and Supply  said Sept. 4, beating the forecast of
51.2 in a Bloomberg survey. A figure over 50 signals growth.  Bond Buying  The ECB’s bond-buying plan will focus on government notes
with maturities of one to three years, Draghi said Sept. 6 at
the central bank’s policy meeting in  Frankfurt .  Gilts returned 3.3 percent this year through Sept. 6,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
2.7 percent, and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.1 percent.  The pound dropped 0.7 percent this week to 79.85 pence per
euro, after declining to 79.94 pence, the weakest level since
July 5. The U.K. currency rose 1 percent to $1.6016, climbing
above $1.60 for the first time since May 16.  Sterling has appreciated 1.3 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The dollar weakened 2 percent, and
the euro declined 3.4 percent.  The U.K. will sell 1.25 billion pounds of inflation-linked
bonds due in March 2034 on Sept. 11, and 3.5 billion pounds of
10-year securities on Sept. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
