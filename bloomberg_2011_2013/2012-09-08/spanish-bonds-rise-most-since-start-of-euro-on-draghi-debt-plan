Spanish bonds rose, pushing 10-year
yields down by the most in a week since the euro was introduced,
as the  European Central Bank ’s new bond-purchase program fueled
optimism that the region’s debt crisis will be contained.  Italian bonds also advanced, reducing the extra yield that
investors demand for holding the nation’s 10-year securities
instead of similar-maturity German bunds to the least in five
months. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said two days ago that policy
makers agreed to an unlimited debt-purchase program to cap
borrowing costs for so-called peripheral nations.  Ten-year bund 
yields rose by the most in six weeks.  “What the ECB did has effectively removed a risk of a
massive sell-off in Spanish and Italian notes,” said Mohit Kumar, the head of European fixed-income strategy at Deutsche
Bank AG in London. “If you are an investor, going short Italian
or Spanish bonds, especially those with short-dated maturities,
will have the poorest reward profile.” A short position is a
bet an asset will decline.  The Spanish 10-year yield dropped 122 basis points from
Aug. 31, or 1.22 percentage point, to 5.63 percent, as of 5 p.m.
 London  time yesterday. That’s the biggest one-week decline since
the euro was introduced in 1999. The 5.85 percent bond due in
January 2022 gained 8.365, or 83.65 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,271) face amount, to 101.505.  Spain ’s  two-year yields 
declined 94 basis points from last week to 2.72 percent, the
biggest weekly fall since the five-day period ended Aug. 3.  ‘Severe Distortions’  Draghi said that, when requested, asset purchases “will
enable us to address severe distortions in government bond
markets, which originate from, in particular, unfounded fears on
the part of investors of the reversibility of the euro.”  Italy’s 10-year yield dropped 77 basis points last week to
5.08 percent. The spread between Italian and German 10-year
yields shrank to as low as 3.44 percentage points yesterday, the
least since April 4.  Germany ’s 10-year yield climbed 18 basis points from Aug.
31 to 1.52 percent, the biggest increase in yield since the five
days through July 27. The two-year rate rose seven basis points
to 0.03 percent, from minus 0.035 percent at the end of last
week.  German bonds may extend a decline next week before the
Federal Finance Agency sells 5 billion euros of five-year notes
on Sept. 12.  Spanish bonds handed investors a 5.5 percent return since
the end of July while German debt fell 1.4 percent, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Italian bonds returned 6.4 percent
during the same period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
