The Louisiana State University
athletics department has agreed to transfer $36 million to
academic programs during the next five years and provide
additional revenue-sharing funds to ease budget pressures.  The LSU Board of Supervisors yesterday approved the policy
that calls for an initial annual transfer of $7.2 million to
support academic, research, public service and other missions in
order to share in the success of the athletics department,
according to the Baton Rouge-based university’s website.  Under the revenue-sharing portion of the plan, the
athletics department will put the first $3 million of a surplus
in athletics reserve accounts. Three-fourths of any excess
between $3 million and $5 million will go to athletics and the
remainder to other parts of LSU. Any profit above $5 million
will be split between athletics and the rest of the university.  In the past, the athletics department has transferred an
additional $4 million to the campus and taken financial
responsibility for the Academic Center for Student-Athletes at a
cost of $1.5 million to help offset a shortage.  The policy doesn’t affect the equal split of revenue from
LSU trademark licensing, nor does it affect tuition payments for
student-athletes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
