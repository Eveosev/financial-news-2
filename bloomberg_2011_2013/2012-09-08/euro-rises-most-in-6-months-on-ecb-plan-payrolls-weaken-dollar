The euro posted its biggest advance
in six months versus the dollar after European Central Bank
President  Mario Draghi  pledged to buy bonds to contain the
region’s debt crisis.  The dollar weakened versus all 16 of its most-traded
counterparts after a Labor Department report showing payrolls
rose less than forecast added to speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will undertake a third round of bond buying. The U.S. central
bank meets Sept. 12-13.  Canada ’s dollar rallied to the strongest
level in a year after employment grew. The Swiss franc fell the
most since November versus the shared currency on reduced demand
for safety.  “Draghi and payrolls were the two main events of the week
and in both cases the strong conclusion that followed both
outcomes was that the cavalry had come in,” said  Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at Westpac Banking
Corp. in  New York . “The Fed and ECB are saying they’re
underwriting risk, so there’s no point in sitting on cash. Sell
the dollar, buy risk.”  The 17-nation euro advanced 1.9 percent for the week to
$1.2786, touching $1.2817 yesterday, the highest level since May
22. The gain is the largest since the five days ended Feb. 24.
The shared currency had the largest weekly rise versus the yen
since Aug. 17. It fetched 100.25, with a 1/7 percent gain, and
reached 100.43, the most since July 4.  Weak Dollar  The yen rose 0.2 percent to 78.24 per dollar. It touched
78.02 the strongest since Aug. 1.  South Africa ’s rand was the
biggest winner against the dollar, rising 2.8 percent, while
 Brazil ’s real had the smallest gain versus the greenback at 0.1
percent.  Further euro gains may be limited as the 14-day relative
strength index for the euro versus the dollar rose above the 70
level yesterday for the first time since May 2011. A reading
above 70 signals an asset may have rallied too far too quickly
and is due for a correction.  The dollar may gain to $1.2650 if the Fed doesn’t announce
further monetary stimulus or sound “sufficiently dovish” at
its meeting, said  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency strategy at
 Wells Fargo & Co . in New York.  The euro has gained 1.9 percent in the past month among the
10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The yen fell 1.3 percent, and the dollar
declined 1.8 percent.  Forecast Level  At about $1.28, the euro is 5 percent above the $1.22
median year-end estimate of more than 50 analysts.  Futures traders  raised bets  that the shared currency will
decline against the dollar for the first time in four weeks.
Net-shorts rose by 745 to 102,306 in the week ended Sept. 4,
according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a record 214,418
reached June 5.  The Dollar Index fell 1.3 percent, touching 80.151, the
lowest since May 11. The gauge, which tracks the greenback
against six major trading partners is weighted 57.6 percent to
the euro. The measure has weakened 7.5 percent since the U.S.
central bank began buying debt in its quantitative easing
program in December 2008 as such measures tend to debase the
currency.  Yen Bets  Futures traders  increased  their bets that the yen will gain
against the dollar. Net longs totaled 24,007 on Sept. 4,
compared with 21,556 net longs a week earlier, according to
CTFC data.  The Swiss franc had its biggest weekly decline against the
euro since November on reduced haven demand. It touched 1.21550
yesterday, its weakest level since January.  The  Swiss National Bank  put a cap of 1.20 per euro on the
franc in September 2011 to limit its strength after investors
sought the currency as a refuge from the euro-area’s debt
crisis.  ECB action will provide further support to euro as it
removes “tail risk” of currency break-up,  Axel Merk , founder
and president of Merk Investments LLC in  Palo Alto ,  California ,
wrote to clients Sept. 6. The policy actions put the euro on
equal footing with other major currencies, he said.  Draghi said the ECB will target  government bonds  with
maturities of one to three years, including longer-dated debt
that has a residual maturity of that length. Purchases will be
fully sterilized, meaning the overall impact on the  money supply 
will be neutral, and the ECB will not have seniority, he said.  Price Swings  Implied volatility, which signals the expected pace of
currency swings, for the currencies of Group of Seven nations
fell to 8.04 percent yesterday, the lowest since October 2007,
according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co.  index . Lower volatility
makes investments in currencies with higher benchmark lending
rates more attractive because the risk in such trades is that
market moves will erase profit.  Australia ’s dollar rallied 0.6 percent against its U.S.
counterpart, touching the highest level against the dollar in a
month. Earlier it fell to a eight-week low after the central
bank kept its overnight cash-rate target at 3.5 percent on Sept.
4 and the economy slowed last quarter.  Traders are pricing in about a 70 percent chance the RBA
will lower the benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to
3.25 percent at its meeting next month, swaps data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Canada’s currency had its biggest gain in four weeks versus
the dollar after the nation added more jobs than projected,
fueling expectations of a central bank interest-rate increase.  Canada’s currency gained 0.8 percent to 97.86 cents per
 U.S. dollar . It touched 97.66, the strongest in a year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
