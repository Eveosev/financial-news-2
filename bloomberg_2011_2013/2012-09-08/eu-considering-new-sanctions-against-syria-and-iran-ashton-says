The European Union may impose
additional sanctions on Syria and  Iran  as it reviews the
effectiveness of those already in place, the EU’s foreign policy
chief  Catherine Ashton  said.  “We keep sanctions under review not only to consider
whether more sanctions should be taken but to make sure that the
enforcement of sanctions is done properly and any ability to
evade them is dealt with,” Ashton told reporters in Nicosia
today after a meeting of the EU’s foreign ministers.  While considering new sanctions,  Europe  has to support the
new United Nations envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, Ashton said.
“His approach will be to look for a political breakthrough that
clearly takes the people into their future and stops the
violence,” she said, adding that EU foreign ministers agreed to
increase humanitarian aid to Syrian refugees by 50 million euros
($64 million).  Ashton said that it is “critical” to urge Syrian groups
opposing President Bashar al-Assad to work together. “It is
also really important that the people in  Syria  feel that they
are part of that future and that means reaching out to minority
groups.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
