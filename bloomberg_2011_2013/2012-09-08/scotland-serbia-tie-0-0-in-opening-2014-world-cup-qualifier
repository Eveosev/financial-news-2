Scotland and Serbia tied 0-0 in
their opening qualifying match for the 2014 soccer  World Cup .  Both goalkeepers made late saves to keep the European Group
A match at Hampden Park in Glasgow scoreless. Scotland’s Allan
McGregor stopped Dusan Tadic’s shot after the striker got behind
the defense in second-half stoppage time and Serbia’s Vladimir
Stojkovic denied James Forrest moments later.  In Group A games last night, Belgium beat Wales 2-0 and
Croatia defeated Macedonia 1-0. Later today in Group B, Denmark
hosts the  Czech Republic .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
