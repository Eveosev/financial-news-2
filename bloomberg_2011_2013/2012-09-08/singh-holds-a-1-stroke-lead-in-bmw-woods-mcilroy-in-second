Vijay Singh  shot a 6-under 66 today
to take a one-stroke lead after the second round of the BMW
Championship, the third of four PGA Tour Playoff events.  Singh completed 36 holes at 13-under 131 at Crooked Stick
Golf Club in Carmel,  Indiana .  Tiger Woods  carded a 5-under 67 to share second place at
12-under 132 with Rory McIlroy, ranked No. 1 in the world, and
 Ryan Moore . McElroy, coming off a win in the Deutsche Bank
Championship, shot a 4-under 68 and Moore fired a 66.  “Today was a struggle,” Woods told reporters. “I fought
hard to shoot a number today, and the way I was hitting it, I
figured if I could get to double digits under par it would be a
good accomplishment. I got a couple more out of it.”  McIlroy, who is the leader in the FedExCup points, was a
co-leader after the first round.  “It wasn’t as good a day as yesterday,” McIlroy said. “I
didn’t hit the ball quite as well, but scored well and did
enough to go out there and shoot another good number and set
myself up in a good position going into the weekend.”  The top 30 on the FedExCup points list advance to the Tour
Championship in two weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
