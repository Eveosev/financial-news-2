Two magnitude 5.6 earthquakes shook
southwestern  China ’s Yunnan and Guizhou provinces yesterday,
killing at least 80 people, destroying more than 6,650 homes,
triggering landslides and disrupting power and communications.  There were 820 reports of injuries, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported today citing local authorities. Power and
communications were cut off and transportation disrupted in
Luozehe, the town in Yunnan’s Yiliang county that was worst hit,
Xinhua said. More than 200,000 people in Yunnan and 28,000 in
Guizhou have been relocated, it said.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  arrived at the quake-stricken areas to
oversee rescue efforts after midnight, Xinhua reported. A 7.9-
magnitude temblor in neighboring Sichuan province in May 2008
killed about 90,000 people after schools and buildings
collapsed, sparking protests and accusations that corrupt
officials turned a blind eye to substandard construction.  China allocated 1.05 billion  yuan  ($166 million) to Yunnan
province for quake relief, the Ministry of Finance said today on
its  website .  The State and provincial civil affairs authorities have
sent 21,000 tents, 31,000 quilts and 26,000 winter coats to
Yunnan, Xinhua reported. A total of 744,000 people were affected
by the earthquakes, it said. More than 60 aftershocks hit as of
6 p.m. local time, Xinhua said.  The death toll from yesterday’s earthquakes relative to
their strength is because of a high population density, weak
housing structures and the mountainous landscape, the People’s
Daily newspaper reported on its website, citing Huangpu Gang,
head of Yunnan’s earthquake bureau. The affected regions are
inhabited by 205 residents for each square kilometer compared
with the province’s average of 117, the newspaper said.  The second magnitude-5.6 quake jolted the border area of
Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan shortly after the first temblor
struck at 11:19 a.m. yesterday, according to the website of the
U.S. Geological Survey’s National Earthquake Information Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
