Austria’s Marcel Hirscher won a men’s
 World Cup  giant slalom in Val d’Isere, France, today for his
first victory of the season. Slovenia’s  Tina Maze  claimed the
women’s race in St. Moritz, Switzerland.  Hirscher, 23, who won the overall and giant slalom titles
last season, clocked a combined time of 1 minute, 54.10 seconds
today. Germany’s Stefan Luitz was second, 1.16 seconds back,
with Ted Ligety of the U.S. in third.  Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal leads the overall World Cup
standings on 440 points and Ligety has 402, with Hirscher on
380. Ligety tops the giant slalom discipline with 260 points,
while Hirscher has 240.  The 29-year-old Maze extended her lead atop the overall
women’s standings following a fourth victory this season. The
Slovenian had a win in a super combined race two days ago and
was second in yesterday’s super-G behind Lindsey Vonn of the
U.S.  Maze finished 0.08 second ahead of Germany’s Viktoria
Rebensburg today, with France’s Tessa Worley in third.  Maze leads the overall standings with 677 points, 234 more
than Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch, with Vonn another 29 points
back. Maze has 300 points in the giant slalom competition, 100
more than second-place Kathrin Zettel of Austria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
