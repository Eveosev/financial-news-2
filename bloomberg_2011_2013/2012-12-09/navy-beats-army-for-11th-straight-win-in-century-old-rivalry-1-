Keenan Reynolds scored on an 8-yard
run with 4:41 remaining in the game to give Navy its 11th
straight college football victory over rival Army, 17-13.  Reynolds, a freshman quarterback, completed 10 of 17 passes
for 130 yards and added 40 yards rushing as the Midshipmen came
from behind yesterday for their eighth win of the season.  Vice President  Joe Biden  was in attendance at the 113th
meeting of the military schools at Lincoln Financial Field in
Philadelphia. Navy has won 57 games. Army (2-9) was the victor
in 49 games in a series that dates back to 1890. Seven games
have ended in ties.  “The kid has been like that all year,” Navy coach Ken
Niumatalolo said of Reynolds in a televised interview before
being presented with the Commander-in-Chief’s trophy. “I’m
looking forward to going to the White House.”  Army controlled much of the game, running for 370 yards,
compared with 162 for Navy. The Black Knights were in position
for a go-ahead touchdown when fullback Larry Dixon fumbled a
handoff from quarterback Trent Steelman on a first-down play
with 1:04 remaining in the fourth quarter. It was Army’s sixth
turnover of the game.  Steelman, who has lost all four games he has played against
Navy in his collegiate career, left the field in tears and was
consoled by teammates.  The two teams were tied at 10-10 after the first half,
before Army scored on a 22-yard field goal by Eric Osteen. Army
was unable to hold the lead as Reynolds led Navy 80 yards down
the field on a seven-play series. The drive included a 49-yard
pass from Reynolds to Brandon Turner to set up the quarterback’s
winning touchdown run.  Navy, with an 8-4 record, will face  Arizona  State
University in a Dec. 29 bowl game in  San Francisco . The team
missed postseason play last season after eight consecutive
appearances. Army didn’t qualify for postseason play.  To contact the reporter on this story:
