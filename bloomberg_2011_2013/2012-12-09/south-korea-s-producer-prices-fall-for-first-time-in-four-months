South Korea ’s  producer prices  fell
from a year earlier for the first time in four months on lower
computer-component and fresh-food costs, according to a report
before the central bank’s decision on  interest rates  this week.  Prices fell 0.2 percent in November from a year ago after a
0.2 percent increase in October, the Bank of Korea said in a
statement today. They fell 0.6 percent from the previous month.  The Bank of Korea has cut interest rates twice this year to
support Asia’s fourth-largest economy. The nation may not meet
its growth estimate of 2.4 percent for this year as any
expansion in the fourth quarter will “not be strong,” BOK
director Jung Yung Taek told reporters in  Seoul  on Dec. 6.  The central bank will leave borrowing costs unchanged at
2.75 percent on Dec. 13, according to a Bloomberg News  survey  of
economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
