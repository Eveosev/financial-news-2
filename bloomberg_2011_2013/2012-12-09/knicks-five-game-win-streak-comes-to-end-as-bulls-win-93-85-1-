Luol Deng and Marco Belinelli each
scored 22 points as the Chicago Bulls defeated New York 93-85
yesterday, ending the Knicks’ five-game winning streak.  The Knicks played without leading scorer Carmelo Anthony,
who missed a second game with stitches in the middle finger of
his left hand. Anthony, who was injured in New York’s win over
Charlotte on Dec. 5, is the third leading scorer in the  National
Basketball Association  at 26.4 points per game.  Carlos Boozer  added 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Bulls,
who won their third straight game.  Raymond Felton  led the Knicks with 28 points, while  Tyson Chandler  added 14 points and 18 rebounds at Chicago’s United
Center. Felton hit 9-of-30 shots from the field, surpassing his
career-high in attempts by six shots.  Anthony, who warmed up before the game only to be kept out
of the lineup, said he expects to play today in Denver.  Elsewhere in the NBA yesterday, it was the Los Angeles
Clippers 117, Phoenix 99; Sacramento 99, Portland 80; Dallas 116,
Houston 109; Golden State 101, Washington 97; San Antonio 132,
Charlotte 102; Boston 92, Philadelphia 79; Miami 106, New
Orleans 90; Detroit 104, Cleveland 97; and Atlanta 92, Memphis
83.  To contact the reporter on this story:
