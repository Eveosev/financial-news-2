Brazil’s power regulator, known as
Aneel, won’t negotiate with power companies seeking further
changes to a measure that would require them to lower
electricity rates in exchange for automatic license renewals,
agency director Nelson Hubner told Estado de S.Paulo.  The government is seeking alternative plans to achieve a 20
percent reduction in electricity rates without the participation
of some companies, Hubner said in an  interview  published today.  One option would be to temporarily remove some taxes on the
energy industry, but this would require a contribution from the
Treasury, Hubner said.  If Belo Horizonte-based Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais
prevails in a potential court challenge to maintain licenses on
three of its main hydroelectric plants, the government would
honor the court’s decision, Hubner said.  Calls to the Aneel press office today by Bloomberg
News went unanswered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
