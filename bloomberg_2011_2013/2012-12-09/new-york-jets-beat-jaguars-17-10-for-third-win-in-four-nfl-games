The  New York  Jets beat the
Jacksonville Jaguars 17-10 while the  Washington Redskins  and
 Dallas Cowboys  both won to leave the  New York Giants  needing to
beat the New Orleans Saints today to retain their division lead.  The Redskins beat the Baltimore Ravens 31-28 in overtime
and the Cowboys won 20-19 with a last-second field goal at the
Cincinnati Bengals. Washington and Dallas improved to 7-6, while
the Giants are 7-5 ahead of the Saints’ visit today.  Shonn Greene  and Bilal Powell ran for second-half
touchdowns at EverBank Field in Jacksonville for the Jets, who
improve to 6-7 with their third win in four games. The Jaguars
drop to 2-11 with their sixth home defeat.  New York sealed the  National Football League  win when a
pass by Jaguars quarterback Chad Henne was intercepted by Ellis Lankster on the Jets’ 4-yard line with 15 seconds remaining.  Dan Bailey kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired at
Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati to seal the win for the
Cowboys, who trailed 19-10 midway through the third quarter.  Dallas players bowed their heads and some covered their
heart with a hand during a moment of silence before the game in
memory of teammate  Jerry Brown .  Cowboys defensive tackle Josh Brent is in custody on a
$500,000 bond after being charged yesterday with intoxication
manslaughter following a car crash that killed Brown. Cowboys
owner  Jerry Jones  said in an interview on Fox that the best way
his players could honor their deceased colleague was to win.  Redskins Win  Kai Forbath kicked a 34-yard field goal in overtime at
FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, to give the Redskins the
victory over local rival Baltimore.  Joshua Morgan, Alfred Morris and Pierre Garcon scored
touchdowns for Washington, whose fourth straight win came after
rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III left the game in the
fourth quarter with a knee injury.  Anquan Boldin of the Ravens caught first-half touchdown
passes of 19 yards and 31 yards from quarterback  Joe Flacco .  Baltimore leads the American Football Conference East
division with a 9-4 mark from Pittsburgh, which dropped to 7-6

Steelers quarterback  Ben Roethlisberger ’s return from a three-
game absence with rib and shoulder injuries.  The Atlanta Falcons (11-2) suffered their second defeat of
the season, falling 30-20 at the Carolina Panthers (4-9).
