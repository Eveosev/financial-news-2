Texas A&M  University quarterback
Johnny Manziel became the first freshman and the second Aggie to
win the Heisman Trophy in the 78-year history of college
football’s top individual award.  Manziel received 2,029 points, 323 more than University of
Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o. Kansas State quarterback
Collin Klein was third in balloting conducted by the Heisman
Trophy Trust.  Manziel, who turned 20 two days ago, totaled 4,600 yards of
offense this season to break the Southeastern Conference record
of 4,327 set by former Auburn University quarterback Cam Newton
during his Heisman-winning 2010 campaign. Manziel has passed for
3,419 yards and 24 touchdowns while rushing for 1,181 yards and
19 scores.  “This is a moment I have dreamed about since I was a
kid,” Manziel said in a televised interview. “I wish my whole
team could be up here with me. To be invited into this
fraternity, what a pleasure it is.”  A 6-foot-1 redshirt freshman from Kerrville,  Texas , Manziel
led Texas A&M to a 10-2 record in its SEC debut, the school’s
first 10-win season since 1998. He also had a showcase
performance that thrust him into the national spotlight,
throwing for 253 yards and two touchdowns in a 29-24 road win
against reigning national champion  Alabama  while rushing for 92
yards on 18 carries.  He is the second-youngest winner to earn the award
following Alabama’s  Mark Ingram , who was 19 when he won in 2009.  Manziel, nicknamed “Johnny Football,” becomes the second
Texas A&M player to win the Heisman Trophy, following halfback
John David Crow in 1957. A high school All-American, Manziel
landed in  College Station , Texas, last year after breaking an
oral commitment to attend the University of Oregon.  Redshirt Freshman  After redshirting during his first year -- delaying his
participation to lengthen his college eligibility -- Manziel
this season replaced National Football League first-round draft
pick Ryan Tannehill as the Aggies’ starting quarterback. Manziel
won the starting job two weeks before the school’s season-
opening game and thrived in the spread offense system used by
new coach Kevin Sumlin, who carried his success from the
 University of Houston  to the SEC.  Manziel started his collegiate career with a 20-17 loss
against the University of  Florida  and then accounted for 15
touchdowns in Texas A&M’s next three games. In a Sept. 29 win
against  Arkansas , Manziel totaled 557 yards of total offense to
break an SEC record that was set by Archie Manning in 1969. He
broke that mark two weeks later with 576 total yards in a win
against Louisiana Tech.  Manziel is the fifth player at college football’s top level
to pass for 3,000 yards and rush for 1,000 yards in the same
season, and the only freshman to do so.  Season’s Numbers  “You put Johnny’s numbers up against anybody in a single
season, not just this year, but any year -- anybody who’s ever
played the game,” Sumlin told reporters last week. “When
you’re talking about those types of numbers and you put that in
perspective with the league we’re playing in, the combination of
those two things tell you all you need to know.”  The Aggies finished ninth in the final Bowl Championship
Series rankings and play No. 11  Oklahoma  in the Cotton Bowl on
Jan. 4 in Arlington, Texas.  Former University of Oklahoma running back  Adrian Peterson 
had the highest previous finish for a freshman in the Heisman
voting, as the runner-up to University of Southern California
quarterback  Matt Leinart  in 2004. Quarterback  Michael Vick  was
third in the 1999 balloting as a freshman, as was running back
Herschel Walker in 1980.  Manziel is the 11th quarterback in the past 13 years to win
the Heisman Trophy as college football’s most outstanding player.
He received 424 first-place votes in the balloting, which is
conducted by a nationwide panel of media members and former
Heisman winners. Te’o had 321 first-place votes; and Klein 60.  Defensive Player  Te’o, a 21-year-old senior, was seeking to become the first
player to win the Heisman while playing only on defense. He led
a Notre Dame defense that allowed the fewest points in the
nation, recording a team-leading 103 tackles and seven
interceptions as the Fighting Irish went 12-0 and will play for
the BCS championship.  Klein, a 23-year-old senior, accounted for 37 touchdowns as
Kansas State went 11-1 and finished fifth in the BCS rankings.
Klein passed for 2,490 yards and 15 touchdowns while rushing for
890 yards and 22 scores.  The Heisman trophy is named in memory of John Heisman, a
former coach who as director of  New York ’s Downtown Athletic
Club helped create the award in 1935. Heisman died from
pneumonia less than a year later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
