GPT Group (GPT) , Australia’s second-
biggest diversified real estate trust, offered to buy  Australand
Property Group (ALZ) ’s industrial and commercial property assets and
development business.  The proposal involves Australand, controlled by Singapore’s
 Capitaland Ltd. (CAPL) , keeping its residential business and remaining
a listed entity, Sydney-based Australand said in a statement to
the Australian stock exchange today. The cash bid, whose pricing
was not disclosed, is incomplete, conditional and subject to due
diligence, it said, advising shareholders to take no action.  Australand’s industrial and office investment properties,
valued at A$2.3 billion ($2.4 billion) at June 30, will provide
about 70 percent of earnings this year, it forecast on Nov. 2.
Its new commercial and industrial development projects have an
end value of A$2.6 billion, it said on July 26. The residential
business, experiencing weakness in  Melbourne  and southeast
Queensland, will see lower sales volumes, it said.  “It wouldn’t make sense for Australand to sell its crown
jewels, which are helping support its residential business,”
Stuart Cartledge, managing director of Melbourne-based Phoenix
Portfolios, said in a telephone interview. “I can understand
why GPT don’t want to buy the whole thing because the last thing
they want is to get into residential development, but I don’t
think they can extract the best bits of Australand without
paying a premium.”  Australand  shares  jumped 6.3 percent to A$3.21 at the close
of trading in Sydney, the highest close since July 2008. GPT
rose 0.8 percent to A$3.63.  Offer Premium  With tenants including  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Ericsson AB’s
Australian operations, Australand saw occupancies at 99 percent
and will have fixed rental growth across most of its properties,
it said Nov. 2.  “GPT would need to offer a premium to book value to make
it attractive to Capitaland, which holds its ownership in
Australand at book, rather than market, value,” John Kim, head
or real estate research at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, wrote in a
note to clients. Australand is likely to be de-listed if the
transaction is successful given the asset value of residential
business is just A$1 billion and its earnings are volatile, he
said in the note.  Australand’s net tangible asset value was A$2 billion, or
A$3.46 a share, as of June 30, according to company statements.
Capitaland owns  59 percent  of Australand, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  GPT Expanding  GPT, which is seeking expansion by boosting  fund management ,
development projects and acquisitions, wants to enter talks with
Australand’s board, it said in a separate statement. GPT
announced its strategy to increase exposure to office, logistics
and business parks in June and a deal with Australand is in line
with that plan, it said.  GPT, which has about A$2 billion of debt capacity to keep
net debt under 35 percent of total assets, may need to sell
shares to fund the acquisition, Kim said.  The company, which has been conservative in its operations,
is unlikely to offer a premium for Australand, said Winston Sammut, Sydney-based managing director at Maxim Asset Management,
who owns shares in both companies.  “I would expect their offer price to be at a slight
discount or at Australand’s net tangible assets,” he said in a
telephone interview. “I don’t see much upside over the next 12
months, so it’s a bit premature to be paying above NTA.”  Demand Softening  Demand for prime industrial space in  Australia  may soften
due to a slowdown in the nation’s resources boom, weaker
economic expansion in  China  and unemployment growth, Los
Angeles-based broker CBRE Group Inc., said in a report in
November. Rental growth in prime office properties also eased in
the three months to Sept. 30 and is expected to slow in the next
year, as business confidence remains weak, the broker said.  Australand has appointed Fort Street Advisers as its
financial adviser and King & Wood Mallesons as its legal adviser,
the company said. GPT is being advised by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, spokesman Brett Zarb said by
telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
