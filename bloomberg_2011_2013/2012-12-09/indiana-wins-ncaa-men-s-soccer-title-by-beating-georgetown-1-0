Indiana University captured its
eighth men’s soccer national championship with a 1-0 win over
 Georgetown University  as junior midfielder Nikita Kotlov scored
the game’s lone goal in the 63rd minute.  Indiana (16-5-3) didn’t allow a goal in its final three
games after upsetting top-seeded Notre Dame 2-1 in double
overtime in the third round of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament. The Hoosiers were seeded 16th in the 48-
team field.  Indiana claimed its first men’s soccer title since winning
back-to-back championships in 2003-04. Third-seeded Georgetown
finishes the season with a 19-4-3 record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
