Some Republicans are softening to the
idea of raising tax rates on top earners in exchange for
discussing entitlement reform during so-called fiscal cliff
talks, according to Senator  Bob Corker .  “There’s a growing group of folks looking at this and
realizing that we don’t have a lot of cards,” the Tennessee
Republican said today on the “Fox News Sunday” program. “I
actually am beginning to believe that is the best route for us
to take” to achieve cuts in entitlement spending, he said.  Senator Chuck Schumer, a  New York  Democrat, appearing on
the same program, said Corker’s comments were encouraging. He
said the same sentiment is necessary from House Speaker  John
Boehner  before there can be any movement in the talks, aimed at
averting automatic spending cuts and tax increases scheduled for
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
