Japan ’s Liberal Democratic Party
Leader Shinzo Abe said he would decide whether to increase a
 sales tax  next year based on economic conditions in the second
quarter.  “It’s impossible to raise the tax if deflation deepens,”
Abe said during a Fuji television program today. A decision will
be made after data on economic conditions from April to June
become available next August, he said.  Polls show the LDP, the largest opposition party, is on
track to return to power it lost in 2009 after the Dec. 16
election, with an absolute majority in the Diet’s lower house.
Abe, in line to become prime minister, has called for
“unlimited” monetary easing to end more than a decade of
falling prices.  Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  won parliamentary
approval in August for his bill to raise the country’s sales tax
for the first time in 15 years.  The bill raises the tax to 8 percent in April 2014 and to
10 percent in 2015, and a clause allows for implementation to be
canceled based on an assessment of economic conditions. The last
sales tax increase in 1997 contributed to pushing the economy
into a 20-month recession, costing then-premier Ryutaro
Hashimoto his job.  To contact the reporter on this story:
