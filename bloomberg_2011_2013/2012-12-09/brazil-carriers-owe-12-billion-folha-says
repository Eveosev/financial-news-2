Brazil ’s telephone companies owe 25
billion reais ($12 billion) in unpaid taxes and fines to the
phone regulatory agency Anatel, newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo
 reported .  Oi SA (OIBR4) , Brazil’s third-largest telecommunications company,
has the biggest bill, owing 9.5 billion reais, according to a
report by a government research arm, which was obtained by the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  The report cited Anatel’s inefficient process and
bureaucratic hurdles in collecting fines, as well as legal
recourse that allows companies to fight charges in court.  Anatel has been pushing mobile carriers in the nation to
improve service. The agency temporarily banned companies from
selling new wireless plans in certain states earlier this year,
signifying it was taking a more aggressive regulatory approach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
