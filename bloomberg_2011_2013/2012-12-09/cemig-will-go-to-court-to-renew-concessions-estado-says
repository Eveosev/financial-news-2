Brazilian power company  Cia
Energetica de Minas Gerais (CMIG4)  said it will go to court to maintain
contracts on three of its main hydroelectric plants, President
Djalma Morais told Estado de S.Paulo.  Cemig, as the Belo Horizonte-based company is known, has
said it won’t seek license renewals under new rules that would
push rates lower because contracts on plants include a guarantee
of automatic renewal that precludes the government’s offer,
Morais said in an  interview  published today.  If the government refuses Cemig’s argument and auctions
licenses on the three plants, Cemig will participate in those
auctions, Morais said, adding that he’s waiting to see what the
final concessions measure approved by Congress and signed by the
President will look like before taking further steps.  A press official for Cemig in Belo Horizonte, who asked not
to be identified in accordance with internal policy, confirmed
the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
