De La Rue Plc (DLAR) , the world’s largest
printer of bank notes, said it will seek to win a contract 
printing notes for the Bank of England through 2025.  “We have a very strong relationship with the bank,” Rob Hutchison, De La Rue’s director of communications said by phone
from  Washington  today. “We will do everything we can to retain
the business.”  The bank issued a  tender  for the supply and security of
banknotes from 2015 to 2025, according to its website. Bidders
must express their interest by Jan. 31, 2013.  The contract is worth 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), the
Sunday Telgraph newspaper reported today, without citing anyone.  De La Rue became the preferred supplier of banknotes to the
Bank of England in 2002 and it bought the state’s printing works
in Debden, east of  London , a year later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
