Nelson Mandela , the former South
African president, remained in a hospital in Pretoria after
being admitted yesterday for undisclosed “medical attention,”
the Presidency said.  President  Jacob Zuma  visited Mandela in the hospital early
today, said  Mac Maharaj , spokesman for Zuma. “He found him
comfortable, and in good care,” Maharaj said in an e-mailed
statement. “We continue to appeal to the media and the public
to respect the privacy of Madiba and his family.” Madiba is
Mandela’s clan name.  Mandela, who turned 94 in July, was undergoing tests for an
undisclosed condition “consistent with his age” and was doing
well, Zuma’s office said in a statement yesterday. The Nobel
Peace Prize laureate underwent exploratory surgery for an
abdominal complaint in February and was hospitalized a year
before that for an acute respiratory infection.  Mandela spent 27 years in prison on an island near  Cape
Town  over his fight for black rights and became the country’s
first black president after apartheid, the official racial
segregation policy, ended in 1994. He negotiated a peaceful end
to the old regime with leaders of South Africa’s white minority
government and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. He
stepped down as president voluntarily in 1999.  To contact the reporter on this story:
