The Philadelphia Phillies acquired
third baseman  Michael Young  from the  Texas Rangers  for a pair of
right-handed relief pitchers, bolstering a position at which
they had seven different starters last season.  Young, 36, spent his first 13 Major League Baseball seasons
with the Rangers, making seven All-Star appearances, and is the
franchise’s all-time leader in hits, runs, doubles, triples and
games-played.  A career .301 hitter, Young batted .277 with eight home
runs and 67 runs batted last season. While he started at all
four infield positions for the Rangers, he’ll probably take over
at third base in Philadelphia, which had Placido Polanco, Kevin Frandsen, Mike Fontenot, Ty Wigginton, Pete Orr, Michael Martinez and Hector Luna all start at least one game at the
position this year.  “Michael brings a lot to our team, not just on the field,
but off it as well,” Phillies General Ruben Amaro Jr. said in a
 statement . “He has been one of the premiere hitters in the
 American League  for a decade and is someone who has a tremendous
presence in the clubhouse.”  Young in 2011 hit a career-best .338 with 11 homers and 106
RBI for Texas while leading the AL with 213 hits. He won the
2005 AL batting title with a .331 average.  The Rangers received Josh Lindblom, 25, and Lisalverto
Bonilla, 22, for Young. Lindblom was 3-5 with one save and a
3.55 earned run average in 74 games for the Phillies and Los
Angeles Dodgers last season, while Bonilla averaged 12.4
strikeouts per nine innings at the Class-A minor-league level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
