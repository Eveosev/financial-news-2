Storm Bopha turned back from its path
toward southern  China  and  Vietnam  and may dissipate within the
day after killing at least 540 people in the  Philippines  in the
nation’s most devastating cyclone this year.  The number of missing climbed to 827, with more than 1,000
injured, according to the  6 a.m. report  of the Manila-based
National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. Cold
air has weakened Bopha, with wind speeds dropping to 55
kilometers per hour, weather forecaster Samuel Duran said by
phone. The cyclone, seen headed to China or Vietnam on Dec. 7,
turned back yesterday, forecaster Meno Mendoza said.  Known locally as Pablo, Bopha packed winds of 175
kilometers per hour and gusts of 210 kilometers per hour when it
landed in Davao Oriental in southern Mindanao province the
morning of Dec. 4.  Bananas accounted for 67 percent of the 8.5 billion pesos
($208 million) in estimated damage, after the storm destroyed
plantations in Mindanao, Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala
told local radio today. More than 46,000 homes were damaged,
according to the state disaster agency’s latest bulletin.  The Southeast Asian nation is regularly battered by
cyclones that form over the  Pacific Ocean , causing devastation
that often prompts criticism of the government’s disaster-
response efforts. Storm  Washi  killed more than 1,200 people,
mostly in Mindanao, in December 2011. In September 2009, Storm
Ketsana flooded Manila and parts of Luzon, killing more than 400
people. Monsoon rains flooded half of the Manila region in
August.  President Benigno Aquino yesterday declared a state of
calamity in affected areas to allow the government to fix prices
of basic goods and local authorities to tap emergency funds.  Looting Reports  Some stores and warehouses in coastal towns of Cateel,
Baganga and  Boston  in Davao Oriental that still had no
electricity reported cases of looting, police Senior
Superintendent Rommil Mitra said yesterday. Unrecognizable, mud-
caked bodies lined the road of some of these towns, Interior
Secretary Mar Roxas said on Dec. 6.  Fatalities from Washi in 2011 surpassed the combined death
toll of 929 from the  Ketsana and Parma  storms in 2009, which
caused more than 38 billion pesos of damage. Typhoon Fengshen
killed about 1,300 people in June 2008 and caused about 7
billion pesos of damage to crops and irrigation. The death toll
from Fengshen included more than 900 people aboard a ship that
capsized.  Total damage caused by typhoons and other natural disasters
in 2011 reached 59.2 billion pesos, Economic Planning Secretary
Arsenio Balisacan said in August. That month,  inflation 
accelerated to 3.8 percent, the fastest pace in seven months, on
supply disruptions that followed flooding caused by torrential
rains.  To contact the reporters on this story:
