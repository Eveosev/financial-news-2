Clermont Auvergne beat defending
champion Leinster 15-12 in rugby’s Heineken Cup to end the Irish
team’s 17-game unbeaten run in  Europe ’s elite club competition.  All the points came from kicks, Morgan Parra converting
four penalties and Brock James having a drop goal for Clermont.
Jonathan Sexton got four penalties for the visitors.  Leinster, which won the competition three times in the past
four seasons, now trails leader Clermont by five points in Pool
5 following the third round of games. The French team was
winning its third straight match.  Also today, Cardiff lost 35-24 to Montpellier, the Welsh
club’s third straight defeat in Pool 6. Cardiff was hit by the
loss of scrum-half Lloyd Williams, dismissed for a foul tackle
on Benoit Paillaugue.  Paillaugue kicked 20 points and Pierre Berard, Mamuka
Gorgodze and Timoci Nagusa scored tries for the French team,
which moves to second spot in Pool 6, five points behind Toulon.  Leicester beat Treviso 33-25 in Pool 2, to move on to 10
points, three behind leader Toulouse.  Yesterday, Harlequins, Toulouse and Toulon all won to
maintain their perfect records. Harlequins routed Zebre 57-14,
Toulouse defeated Ospreys 30-14 and Toulon had a 17-6 win over
Sale Sharks.  Saracens and Munster lead Pool 1 on 10 points, Harlequins
has a six-point advantage over Connacht in Pool 3, and Ulster
leads Castres by six points in Pool 4 after three straight wins.  The six pool-winners and two best-placed runners-up qualify
for the quarterfinals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
