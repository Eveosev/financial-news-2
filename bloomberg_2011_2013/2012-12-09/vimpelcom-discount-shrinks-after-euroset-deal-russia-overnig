VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  rose last week to
trade at the smallest discount versus its emerging-market peers
in more than three weeks as the mobile provider moves beyond a
shareholder dispute and bolsters its presence in  Russia .  Shares of VimpelCom jumped 3.7 percent last week to a one-
month high in  New York , pushing the stock to 11.3 times
estimated earnings, compared with an average multiple of 13.2
for the  MSCI Emerging Markets Telecommunications Services Index. (MXEF0TC) 
It was the narrowest gap since Nov. 14. The  Bloomberg Russia-US
Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies traded in the U.S. climbed 2.8
percent to 95.41 last week, while the Dec. 7 evening session of
the futures on the RTS Index was canceled as the Moscow Exchange
tested their new platform.  VimpelCom has climbed 2 percent since Nov. 23, when Russia
agreed to withdraw its case against  Norway ’s  Telenor ASA (TEL)  for
boosting its stake in the phone company, a move that frees
VimpelCom to distribute dividends. The company, Russia’s third-
biggest mobile phone provider, said on Dec. 7 that it had raised
its stake in Euroset Holding NV to 50 percent, splitting the
Moscow-based retailer with  OAO MegaFon (MFON) , Russia’s second-biggest
mobile operator.  “People are expecting dividends will resume very soon and
are pleased,” Sergey Libin, an analyst at ZAO Raiffeisenbank,
who rates VimpelCom hold said in a phone interview Dec. 7 from
Moscow. “VimpelCom has successfully kept MegaFon from obtaining
a controlling stake in Euroset. They see potential in the
Russian market.”  Russia provided 42 percent of VimpelCom’s revenue last year
as the nation’s economy grew 4.3 percent. Gross domestic product
in Russia, the world’s largest energy exporter, will expand 3.5
percent in 2013 after rising 3.6 percent in 2012, according to
the median estimate of 35 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  Dividend Yields  MegaFon, which raised $1.7 billion in its initial public
offering last month, and its main shareholder billionaire
 Alisher Usmanov  paid a combined $1.07 billion for 50 percent of
Euroset. VimpelCom raised its stake in Euroset by 0.1 percent to
50 percent.  VimpelCom, controlled by Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman and Telenor, will hold its annual shareholder meeting on
Dec. 21.  A Moscow court had banned the Amsterdam-based company’s
Russian unit from paying dividends earlier this year because the
anti-monopoly service, knows as FAS, opposed Telenor’s moves to
increase its stake. The dispute was settled when Fridman
increased his voting stake in VimpelCom to 47.85 percent in
October. Telenor owns 43 percent of VimpelCom’s voting shares.  The company’s dividend yield was 4.1 percent over the past
12 months, compared with the 3.5 percent average for Russia-US
index companies.  Oil Drops  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, climbed 2.9 percent to $28.64 last
week, the highest level since Oct. 22. The evening trading
sessions of FORTS and the Standard market were canceled Dec. 7
as the Moscow Exchange tested its new SPECTRA platform,
according to a statement on its website.  Oil, which together with natural gas accounted for half of
Russia’s  federal budget  revenue last year, capped the first
weekly decline since early November on Dec. 7.  Crude for January delivery dropped 0.4 percent to $85.93 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices fell 3.4
percent last week and are down 13 percent this year. Brent oil
for January settlement lost 3.8 percent to $107.01 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, while  Urals crude ,
the country’s main export blend, rose 0.1 percent to $105.54 on
Dec. 7, trimming its decline last week to 3.8 percent.  Norilsk Rallies  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (NILSY) , the world’s largest producer of the
metal, surged 12 percent to $17.73, the biggest weekly gain in
two years. The company advanced 9.8 percent to 5,298 rubles, or
the equivalent of $171.85, in Russia’s Micex Exchange. One ADR
equals a 10th of an ordinary share.  The billionaire shareholders in Moscow-based Norilsk may
agree to distribute more than $10 billion in dividends as part
of an agreement to end a four-year battle over control,
according to three people with knowledge of the talks. The
company would pay the money on profit earned between 2012 to
2014, the people said on Dec. 5, asking not to be identified
because a final agreement hasn’t been signed.  Separately, Norilsk said on Dec. 7 that the first stage of
a facility to reduce emissions will start in late 2016 as the
company woos investors after Norway banned it from the country’s
wealth fund.  American depositary receipts of  OAO RusHydro (RSHYY)  traded in New
York fell 1.8 percent last week to $2.23. Shares on Russia’s
Micex Index rose 0.1 percent to 73.51 kopecks, or the equivalent
of 2.38 U.S. cents. One ADR is equal to 100 shares.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
rose 1.9 percent to HK$4.85 in Hong Kong trading as of 10:59
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
