ICAP Plc (IAP) , the world’s largest broker
of transactions between banks, cut Chief Executive Officer
 Michael Spencer ’s annual bonus by 29 percent as profit fell.  Spencer, 58, earned 2.78 million pounds ($4.3 million) in
bonus for the year ended March 31, London-based ICAP said in its
annual report published today. That compares with 3.9 million
pounds a year earlier. His total compensation declined to 4.2
million pounds from 5.51 million pounds.  The “difficult trading conditions during the year have
produced a lower financial outcome,” resulting a reduction in
the bonus pool for the three executive directors from the
previous year, ICAP said. The other two executive directors were
Iain Torrens and John Nixon.  ICAP’s  pretax profit  before exceptional items in the year
through March fell 20 percent to 284 million pounds as a slowing
economy and low  interest rates  crimped trading between firms.  Interdealer brokers such as ICAP act as a go-between for
banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives. They profit when prices fluctuate because more
traders use the products they trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
