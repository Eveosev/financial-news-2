Born in 1926 and growing up in
Chicago,  Hugh Hefner  was voted “Third Most Likely to Succeed”
in high school. After a stint in the army, he went to the
University of Illinois, where he met Mildred Williams. At 22,
Hefner was still a virgin.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In the spring of 1948, the two finally had sex. Thinking
that meant they now had to get married, the couple wed the
following year and moved in with his parents.  Unlike his wife, Hefner was obsessed by sex. He decided to
create a men’s magazine that didn’t make the audience feel
guilty about erotic desire, while also selling a smooth version
of U.S. consumerism.  For the first issue in 1953, he paid $500 for nude pictures
of  Marilyn Monroe  and six additional months of topless women.
Playboy was a hit from the beginning. The Hefners stayed married
until 1959.  I spoke with Thomas Dyja, author of “The Third Coast: When
Chicago Built the American Dream,” on the following topics:  1. Middle America  2. German Intellectuals  3. Sex & Rock  4. Regular Guy  5. Jet Planes  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  (Lewis Lapham is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
