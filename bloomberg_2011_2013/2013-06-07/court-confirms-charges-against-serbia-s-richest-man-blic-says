A Serbian court confirmed criminal
charges against Miroslav Miskovic, Serbia’s wealthiest man,
filed by a prosecutor for alleged  tax evasion  and abuse of
office, Blic newspaper reported, citing an unidentified
official.  The Higher Court in Belgrade also decided to keep Miskovic
in detention for another 30 days, the newspaper said. A special
prosecutor for organized crime indicted Miskovic, his son Marko
and nine associates, on May 9.  Lawyers at Jankovic, Popovic & Mitic, the  law firm 
representing Miskovic, weren’t immediately available for
