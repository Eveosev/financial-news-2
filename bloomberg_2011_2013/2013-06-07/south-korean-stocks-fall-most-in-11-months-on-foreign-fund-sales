South Korea ’s stocks fell the most in
11 months after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut its profit estimates
for Samsung Electronics Co. and foreign investors sold the most
domestic equities since August 2011.  The benchmark Kospi index dropped 1.8 percent to 1,923.85
at the close, the biggest loss since July 2012. Samsung
Electronics, the country’s most valuable company, slid 6.2
percent, the most since August 2012. Samsung accounted for
almost 70 percent of the Kospi’s losses.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) 
dropped 1.2 percent. Foreign funds sold a net 928.2 billion won
($831.1 million) of Kospi  index  shares today, Korea Exchange
Inc. data show.  “Samsung is leading the decline in South Korean stocks
today as some reports cite uncertainties in the company’s future
smartphone sales and some investors appear to be selling the
biggest South Korean stocks to brace for increasing volatility
in financial markets,” Seung Min You, chief strategist at
Samsung Securities, said by phone today.  Samsung Electronics, the world’s top smartphone maker, had
its share-price and earnings estimates cut at JPMorgan, which
said weaker-than-expected high-end smartphone shipments will
likely result in lower margins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
