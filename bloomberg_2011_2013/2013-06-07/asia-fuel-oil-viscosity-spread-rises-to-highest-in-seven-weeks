The spread between higher and low
quality fuel oil in Asia widened to the most in seven weeks as
 BP Plc (BP/)  and  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN)  boosted purchases of the more
expensive grade of the refined product.  The viscosity spread for the remainder of June, or the
 differential  between the price of 180-centistoke and 380-centistoke fuel oil, rose a seventh day to $15.75 a metric ton
at 12:55 p.m. in  Singapore . That’s the highest level since April
22, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BP, Glencore and
 PetroChina Co. (857)  bought a total of at least 1.06 million tons of
180-centistoke cargoes so far this month in the Platts window,
more than three times as much as was purchased in May, a
Bloomberg survey of traders who monitor the trading platform
shows.  “The viscosity spread is a lot stronger,” Alex Yap, an
analyst at Facts Global Energy, said by telephone from
Singapore. “Prices are quite likely to be supported.”  BP bought a total of 22 cargoes, or 440,000 tons, of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  during the four trading sessions on Platts
this month, the Bloomberg survey shows. Glencore purchased 18
shipments, or 360,000 tons, and PetroChina took 13 cargoes, or
260,000 tons. The supplies were mostly provided by Litasco SA
and Vitol Group, the survey shows. About 280,000 tons of the
fuel were traded in the Platts window in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
