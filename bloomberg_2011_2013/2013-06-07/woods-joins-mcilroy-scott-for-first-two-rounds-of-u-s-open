Tiger Woods , Rory McIlroy and  Adam Scott , golf’s three top-ranked players, will be grouped together
during the first two rounds of next week’s  U.S. Open .  The U.S. Golf Association, which stages the sport’s second
annual major championship, today on Twitter disclosed select
groupings for the event, which is scheduled for June 13-16 at
Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania.  Woods, a three-time U.S. Open winner, is seeking his first
major victory since capturing the 2008 Open at Torrey Pines in
San Diego. Northern Ireland’s McIlroy won the 2011 event at
Congressional Country Club near Washington, while Australia’s
Scott, 32, won the Masters Tournament in April for his first
Grand Slam victory. Scott’s current caddie,  Steve Williams ,
previously worked for Woods.  Woods, 37, and McIlroy, 24, have been paired together 12
times in their careers, with Woods recording the lower score
nine times. The trio will begin their first round at 1:14 p.m.
New York time, followed by a 7:44 a.m. second-round tee time.  Spain’s Sergio Garcia, who was criticized by Woods last
month after making comments that the 14-time major winner called
“hurtful” and “inappropriate”, will play alongside former
British Open champions Padraig Harrington of Ireland and Stewart Cink of the U.S.  Defending U.S. Open champion  Webb Simpson , 27, will play
with two-time winner Ernie Els, 43, of South Africa and 22-year-old U.S. Amateur champion Steven Fox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
