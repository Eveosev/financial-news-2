Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA and
Petroleo Brasileiro SA plunged after Standard & Poor’s lowered
the state-run companies’ credit outlook as Brazilian economic
growth slows and government debt levels rise.  Eletrobras, as the electricity producer is known, dropped
5.3 percent to 9 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo. Rio
de Janeiro-based Petrobras slid 3.2 percent to 18.84 reais. Both
companies are rated BBB, two levels above junk.  Standard & Poor’s revised their outlook to negative from
stable yesterday after doing the same for  Brazil ’s BBB rating
citing forecasts for a third year of “modest” economic growth
and “weaker” fiscal policy, the ratings company said in a
statement yesterday. The outlook cut for Eletrobras and
Petrobras “reflects the similar action” on Brazil, Standard &
Poor’s said in a separate statement.  Brazil’s central bank in April shifted its focus to
containing inflation by increasing the benchmark interest rate
for the first time in almost two years. Brazil’s economy has
posted growth below analyst forecasts for five straight
quarters. The economy expanded 0.55 percent in the first
quarter, less than the 0.9 percent median forecast of analysts
polled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
