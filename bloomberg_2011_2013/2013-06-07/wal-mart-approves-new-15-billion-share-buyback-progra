Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , which kicked
off its annual meeting today, approved a new $15 billion share
buyback program.  The new buyback program was effective yesterday and
replaces the previous $15 billion authorization, which had about
$712 million remaining, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company
said today in a statement.  The world’s largest retailer is grappling with myriad
challenges. Wal-Mart is trying to goose slowing sales gains in
the U.S. as such rivals as  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and the dollar stores
lure its customers. Overseas, the company is struggling to
ignite growth in China and other  emerging markets  even as it
probes allegations of bribery in  Mexico  and possible violations
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.  Wal-Mart is also contending with increasingly restive labor
groups clamoring for better working conditions. Protesters from
OUR Walmart, a union-backed organization of employees, descended
on Bentonville this week.  Wal-Mart has bought back about $36 billion in stock in its
four previous fiscal years, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. The buybacks have pushed the founding Walton family’s
stake in the company past 50 percent, giving Wal-Mart the
right under  New York  Stock Exchange rules to have a minority of
independent directors on the board. The company has said it has
no plans to take advantage of the rules.  Wal-Mart rose 1.4 percent to $76.67 at 10:40 a.m. in New
York. The shares gained 11 percent this year through yesterday
compared with a 14 percent rise for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index  To contact the reporter on this story:
