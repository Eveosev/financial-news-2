Russia ’s top grain producing area
Krasnodar received about half the normal amount of rainfall last
month, leaving winter grain with dry leaves and small seeds, the
state weather center  said .  The region received 37 millimeters (1.5 inches) of rain in
May and temperatures rose as high as 34 degrees Celsius (93
degrees Fahrenheit), about 3.8 degrees Celsius higher than
usual, the center said on its website today.  “These conditions affected the plumpness of winter grain
in May,” the center said.  Rainfall in early June improved growth conditions for
spring grain in the area and was too late to help winter
plantings, the center said.  Krasnodar harvested 8.8 million metric tons of grain, or
13 percent, of the national crop in 2012-13, according to state
statistics data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
