Occupations paying below-average
wages accounted for more than half of last month’s U.S. payroll
increase, a dynamic that may restrain  consumer spending  and the
economic recovery.  Retailers, the hospitality industry and temporary-help
agencies accounted for 96,300, or 55 percent, of 175,000 jobs
added in May, figures from the Labor Department showed today in
 Washington .  “It’s not just jobs, it’s the kinds of jobs we’re
creating,” said  Diane Swonk , chief economist at Chicago-based
Mesirow Financial Inc. “We need to see more broad-based and
even growth in the economy to see better jobs return. We’re
still relying too much on the part-time and contingent
workforce.”  The composition of the employment gain caused hourly
earnings for all employees to stagnate at $23.89 on average last
month, up a cent from April. They rose 2 percent over the past
12 months, compared with year-to-year increases averaging 3.5
percent in the 10 months leading up to the recession that began
in December 2007.  The leisure and hospitality industry, which includes
hotels, restaurants, casinos and amusement parks, added 43,000
workers to payrolls last month. On average, those employees are
paid $13.45 an hour, the lowest of any of the 10 major
employment categories, according to the Labor Department.  Retailers added 27,700 jobs in May, with an average hourly
wage of $16.63. Temporary help accounted for 25,600 jobs with an
average wage of $15.74 an hour.  Less Pay  Other lower-paying occupations, including ambulatory and
home health care services, also posted gains last month.  In contrast, construction companies, which pay employees an
average $26.06 an hour, added 7,000 jobs in May. Manufacturing,
which pays $24.22 an hour, lost 8,000 jobs.  It’s not unusual to see low-wage job growth when
unemployment is high, said Heidi Shierholz, an economist at the
 Economic Policy Institute  in Washington, which gets some of its
funding from labor unions.  “Low-quality jobs are always available but go unfilled
when there are other jobs,” Shierholz said. “At a time like
this, workers have to settle for anything they can get.”  There were 7.9 million people working part-time in May  for
economic reasons , meaning they preferred full-time work but
couldn’t get it, according to Labor Department data. While that
is down from the record 9.23 million reached in September 2010,
it’s up from the 4.4 million on average during the previous
expansion.  Twenty-one percent of all job losses during the recession
were in occupations paying median hourly wages of $13.83 or
less,  according  to the National Employment Law Project in  New
York , a non-profit employee-advocacy group. By contrast, those
occupations accounted for 58 percent of new positions during the
recovery from February 2010 to March 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
