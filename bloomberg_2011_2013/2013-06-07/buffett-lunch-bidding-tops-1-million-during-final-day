Warren Buffett’s annual charity
auction, in which bidders compete for a chance to dine with the
billionaire, drew a top offer of more than $1 million in the
final hours of the weeklong event.  Bidding passed the $1 million mark at about 5:57 p.m. today
in New York, according to the  event page  on  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s website.
Offers almost tripled in value during the final minute last
year, ending with a winning bid of $3.46 million.  Buffett, 82, the chairman and chief executive officer of
Omaha, Nebraska-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , has pledged his
fortune to charity. The world’s third-richest man, Buffett has
also helped raise more than $14 million for San Francisco’s
Glide Foundation with 13 years of lunch auctions.  “Warren Buffett is a person that we never thought would
come along,” Rev. Cecil Williams, who runs Glide, said in a
telephone interview. “What a great man, what a great gift and
what a great commitment he’s given us.”  Williams’s 50th anniversary at Glide was  celebrated  last
month by baseball’s San Francisco Giants. Glide serves meals and
provides social services to the poor on an annual budget of
about $17 million. The charity was brought to Buffett’s
attention by his first wife, Susan, a volunteer for the group.  The auction ends at 10:30 p.m. today. The winner and seven
companions get to dine with Buffett at the New York steakhouse
Smith & Wollensky.  This week’s winner may pay more than $4 million, Mohnish Pabrai, who was part of a group that paid $650,100 in 2007, said
in a telephone interview from  Irvine ,  California .  Buffett has dined with last year’s winner, who chose to
remain anonymous, the billionaire’s assistant said in an e-mail.  Glide Lunch With  Warren Buffett  Results:
