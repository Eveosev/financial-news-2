Thor Industries Inc. (THO) , the maker of
Airstream recreational vehicles and Champion buses, rose to its
highest closing price in more than five years after reporting
quarterly profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  surged 12 percent to $46.16 at the close in  New
York , the highest since Nov. 2, 2007. The Elkhart, Indiana-based
company’s stock has gained 23 percent this year, as the Standard
& Poor’s Midcap 400 Index climbed 16 percent.  Thor’s fiscal third-quarter net income increased to $43.8
million from $41.3 million a year earlier, according to a
statement yesterday. Excluding costs such as goodwill and asset
writedowns, earnings for the three months ended April 30 were 97
cents a share, the company said. The average of seven analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was 88 cents.  “We are now in the middle of the peak selling season for
the RV industry, when demand improves and discounting tends to
stabilize, leaving us in a strong position to finish out the
year,” Chief Operating Officer  Bob Martin  said in the
statement.  Sales of recreational vehicles are monitored as an economic
indicator because the motor homes and travel trailers are
discretionary purchases that consumers defer during a slump.  Thor’s quarterly  revenue  rose 13 percent to $1.05 billion.
The company reported the third-quarter results after the close
of New York trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
