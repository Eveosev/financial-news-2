Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the world’s
largest smartphone maker, fell the most in more than nine months
in  Seoul  after analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut profit
estimates, citing slowing demand for its flagship Galaxy S4.  The  shares  declined 6.2 percent to 1,427,000 won as of the
close of trade, the largest drop since Aug. 27. The stock was
the  biggest drag  on the MSCI Asia Pacific index.  Orders for the S4 smartphone, which went on sale last
month, are slowing on weak demand in Europe that may impact
profit margins, analysts led by JJ Park said in a report dated
yesterday, citing supply chain checks. JPMorgan cut its share-price estimate for Samsung by 9.5 percent to 1.9 million won and
lowered its 2013 earnings estimates by 9 percent.  “Compared to S3, S4 had stronger momentum in the first
quarter of launch,” the analysts wrote, affirming their
overweight  rating  on the stock. “But the following quarter’s
shipment is expected to be disappointing and its peak-quarter
number seems way below our previous estimates.”  JPMorgan now expects Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung’s
shipments of the S4 to be 60 million this year, compared with a
previous estimate of 80 million. Samsung sold 10 million units
of the S4 within 27 days, the company said.  It also unveiled a smaller, less-powerful version of the
phone last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
