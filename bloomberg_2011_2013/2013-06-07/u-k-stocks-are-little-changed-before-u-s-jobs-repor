U.K. stocks  rallied, trimming the
 FTSE 100 (UKX)  Index’s biggest weekly drop this year, as U.S. payrolls
topped forecasts and a gain in the  unemployment rate  boosted
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will maintain stimulus measures.  Bellway Plc (BWY)  added 1.4 percent after the homebuilder said
reservations in the past four months rose 31 percent as buyers
had greater access to mortgages.  Elan (ELN)  Corp. jumped to a 10-month
high in Dublin after Royalty Pharma increased its offer for the
Irish drugmaker to as much as $6.7 billion. BT Group increased
3.7 percent as Barclays Plc recommended investors buy shares of
the U.K.’s largest fixed-line company.  The FTSE 100 climbed 75.88 points, or 1.2 percent, to
6,411.99 at the close in  London . The index has still fallen 2.6
percent this week, the biggest drop since November, amid
speculation the Fed will tighten monetary policy by trimming
bond purchases as the  U.S. economy  strengthens. The FTSE All-Share Index also advanced 1.2 percent today, while Ireland’s
ISEQ Index rallied 1.4 percent.  “The market obviously thought that U.S. unemployment would
ease a bit,” said Carsten Hilck, who oversees about $6.5
billion at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in  Frankfurt . “As
this hasn’t happened there will be no ending of quantitative
easing. This has been driving the market so we’d better stay
above the 6.5 percent unemployment level.”  The U.S.  unemployment rate  climbed to 7.6 percent last
month from 7.5 percent in April, according to a Labor Department
report. Still, companies boosted payrolls by 175,000 workers
after they increased by a revised 149,000 in April. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated a gain of 163,000.  Fed Purchases  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  in May signaled the central
bank could curtail its bond buying if the job market improves in
a “real and sustainable way.”  Bellway advanced 1.4 percent to 1,334 pence. The U.K.
government’s Help to Buy initiative, which enables buyers to pay
a deposit as low as 5 percent of the property’s value, helped
the company have 160 reservations a week in the four months
through May 31, according to a statement today.  Elan jumped 5.3 percent to 9.97 euros in Dublin, its
highest price since July 23, 2012. Royalty Pharma raised its
takeover offer for the drugmaker to $13 per American depositary
receipt plus a contingent value right of as much as $2.50. The
offer was previously for $12.50 per ADR.  BT Group climbed 3.7 percent to 312.8 pence. Barclays
increased its rating on the  stock  to overweight, similar to a
buy recommendation, from equal weight. The phone company’s free
cash flow may increase as the take-up of BT’s fiber network
accelerates, according to analysts led by Maurice Patrick.  Severn Trent  Severn Trent Plc (SVT)  advanced 2.5 percent to 2,070 pence,
snapping four days of losses. Borealis Infrastructure Management

utility to 5.3 billion pounds ($8.2 billion).  Partnership Assurance Group Plc, a U.K. annuity provider
