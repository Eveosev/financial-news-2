Vietnam ’s bonds completed their best
week since March as investors bid for more than three times the
amount of government securities offered at an auction. The dong
was little changed.  The State Treasury sold 2 trillion dong ($95 million) of
five-year notes to yield 7.3 percent yesterday, with bids
received for 6.15 trillion dong, according to the Hanoi Stock
Exchange website. That compares with 7.78 percent at the
previous auction.  The “bid-to-cover ratio was three times, still implying
ample demand,” Saigon Securities Inc. wrote in a note today.  The five-year yield slumped 46 basis points, or 0.46
percentage point, in five days to 7.32 percent, the biggest
weekly decline since March 29, according to a daily fixing from
lenders compiled by Bloomberg. The rate rose eight basis points
today.  The dong traded at 21,016 per dollar as of 3:35 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 21,013 a week ago, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The State Bank of Vietnam set its reference rate
at 20,828, unchanged since December 2011, according to its
website. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent
on either side of the daily fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
