India’s rupee headed for a fifth
weekly drop on concern the  Federal Reserve  may scale back debt
purchases that have fueled fund flows to  emerging markets .
 Government bonds  rose.  Overseas investors bought $15.3 billion more local shares
than they sold this year through June 5, helping ease pressure
on the rupee from India’s record current-account  deficit . Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last month the central bank may
cut the pace of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing, in
the next few meetings if policy makers see indications of
sustained improvement in the U.S. jobs market.  “The withdrawal of QE by the Fed might not mean an
immediate withdrawal of funds from India but is more likely to
lead to a stoppage of flows,” said  Indranil Pan , chief
economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “The currency
will remain weak, specifically as reliance of India on global
flows continues to be strong due to the large current-account
deficit.”  The rupee fell 0.6 percent this week to 56.795 per dollar
as of 10:08 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency rose 0.1 percent today. It touched 57
yesterday, the weakest level since June 28, 2012.  One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, fell 34 basis points, or 0.34
percentage point, this week to 8.9 percent.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
bonds each month to keep borrowing costs low and spur the  U.S.
economy . Nonfarm payrolls data due today may provide an
indication of whether the purchases will be reduced.  Slowing Inflation  The shortfall in the current account, the broadest measure
of trade, was probably about 5 percent of gross domestic product
in the fiscal year through March 2013,  Reserve Bank  of India
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said last month. India, the world’s
largest gold buyer, increased import duties on the precious
metal this week to 8 percent from 6 percent to rein in the gap.  Wholesale  prices  rose 4.88 percent in May, the least since
2009, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before
official data due June 14.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government bonds due May 2023
fell four basis points this week and one basis point today to
7.21 percent, according to the central bank’s trading system.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 57.72 per
dollar, compared with 57.42 on May 31, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were at 57.69
versus 57.60. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
