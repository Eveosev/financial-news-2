Actis LLP , a London-based private
equity company and  Mainstream Renewable Power Ltd.  will develop
$1.4 billion of wind and solar projects in  Chile  to help curb
electricity shortages threatening the  mining industry .  Actis agreed to invest $290 million for a 60 percent stake
in developer Aela Energia, with the remaining shares held by
Dublin-based Mainstream, Actis said today in a statement. The
venture will build 600 megawatts of projects by 2016, boosting
Chile’s renewable capacity by 3.6 percent and providing power
for 131,000 homes.  Chile, the world’s biggest copper producer, needs to boost
electricity supplies as power shortages jeopardize its $104
billion mine-project pipeline. Energy Minister Jorge Bunster
said in April the nation will add 1,000 megawatts in 2013 as
power use grows 5.5 percent to 6 percent a year and demand from
mines jumps an estimated 68 percent in the coming decade.  “This platform is about meeting the needs of offtakers,
particularly large-scale industrial consumers in Chile who need
top-quality projects and competitive electricity prices,”
Mainstream Chief Executive Officer Eddie O’Connor said in a
separate statement.  Aela Energia will buy the projects developed by Mainstream
once financing contracts for the plants are signed. Mainstream
will manage construction and operations, it said.  Actis, with $5.2 billion of funds under management, has
already financed the  Cerro de Hula  project in  Honduras , the
nation’s first wind farm. Mainstream is developing more than
3,500 megawatts of renewable-energy plants in Chile and has
worked with Actis before on wind and solar in  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
