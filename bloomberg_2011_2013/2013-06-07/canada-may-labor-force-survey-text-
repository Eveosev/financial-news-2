Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by Statistics Canada.  Following little change the previous month, employment rose
by 95,000 in May, with most of the increase in full-time work.
This employment gain pushed the unemployment rate down 0.1
percentage points to 7.1%.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment grew 1.4% or
250,000, all in full-time work. Over the same period, the total
number of hours worked rose 1.1%.  In May, employment increased in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta,
New Brunswick and Manitoba, while it declined in Prince  Edward
Island .  Employment rose in construction; retail and wholesale
trade; “other services;” and business, building and other
support services.  All of the employment gains in May were among private
sector employees, offsetting losses over the previous two months
for this group.  Employment in May increased among youths and people aged 55
and over, while it was little changed for those aged 25 to 54.  Employment gains in several provinces  In May, employment in Ontario increased by 51,000, with
large gains in full-time work partly offset by losses in part-time work. With this gain, the unemployment rate fell 0.4
percentage points to 7.3%, the lowest since November 2008. Year-over-year growth was 2.0%, higher than the national average of
1.4%.  Employment in  Quebec  rose by 20,000 in May, offsetting
declines earlier in the year. The unemployment rate was 7.7%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment was up 1.3%.  In Alberta, employment increased for the second consecutive
month, up 19,000 in May. Despite this gain, the unemployment
rate for the province was up 0.4 percentage points to 4.8% as
more people participated in the labour force. On a year-over-year basis, employment growth in this province was 2.3%, all in
full-time work.  The number of workers in New Brunswick rose by 3,700 in May,
offsetting the decline in April. The unemployment rate for the
province was 10.5% in May. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment was down 1.3%.  Following a decline the previous month, employment in
Manitoba increased by 3,000 in May and the unemployment rate was
5.7%. On a year-over-year basis, employment was little changed.  In Saskatchewan, employment was little changed for the
fourth consecutive month. Nevertheless, year-over-year growth
was 2.9%, well above the national average.  Large gains in construction in May  Following two months of little change, construction rose by
43,000 in May. With this gain, construction was up 5.8% or
74,000 from 12 months earlier.  In May, employment in retail and wholesale trade increased
by 27,000. Over the previous 12 months, employment in this
industry rose 3.1% or 83,000.  Employment in “other services,” such as repair and
maintenance or private household services, increased by 22,000
in May. Despite this month’s gain, employment remained below its
level from 12 months earlier, down 5.5% or 45,000.  The number of workers in business, building and other
support services rose by 21,000 in May. Compared with 12 months
earlier, employment in this industry was up 5.6% or 38,000.  Employment rose by 95,000 among private sector employees in
May, and was little changed for public sector employees and the
self-employed. Compared with 12 months earlier, the number of
private sector employees increased 1.1% or 123,000. Public
sector employment was up 2.6% or 92,000, mainly from gains in
health care and social assistance. Self-employment was little
changed over this 12-month period.  Employment up among youths and people aged 55 and over  In May, employment was up 54,000 among youths aged 15 to 24,
with gains in Ontario, Quebec, and  Alberta . This increase pushed
their unemployment rate down 0.9 percentage points to 13.6%.
With the employment increase in May, year-over-year gains for
this age group totalled 48,000 (+2.0%).  Following two months of little change, employment among
people aged 55 and over rose by 34,000 in May, with gains for
both men and women, pushing the unemployment rate for this age
group down 0.3 percentage points to 5.8%. Over the previous 12
months, employment increased 142,000 (+4.4%), mostly a result of
population ageing.  Among people aged 25 to 54, employment was little changed
in May. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment for people
in this age group was up 60,000 (+0.5%).  Student summer employment  From May to August, the Labour Force Survey collects labour
market data about young people aged 15 to 24 who were attending
school full time in March and who intend to return to school
full time in the fall. The May survey results provide the first
indicators of the summer job market, especially for students
aged 20 to 24, as many students aged 15 to 19 are not yet out of
school for the summer. The data for June, July and August will
provide further insight into the summer job market. The
published data are not seasonally adjusted, and therefore
comparisons can only be made from one year to another.  The rate of employment among returning students aged 20 to
24, that is, the number of employed as a percentage of their
population, was 59.9% in May, similar to that of 12 months
earlier. Their unemployment rate was 15.5% in May, little
changed from a year earlier.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a
result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends
observed over longer time periods. Estimates for smaller
geographic areas or industries also have more variability. For
an explanation of sampling variability of estimates and how to
use standard errors to assess this variability, consult the
“Estimates quality” section of the publication Labour Force
Information (71-001-X).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=eng ) .  Each year, the LFS revises its estimates for the previous
three years, using the latest seasonal factors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
