 German 10-year bonds erased an
advance after a report showed U.S. companies added more jobs
than forecast in May.  The yield on the securities was little changed at 1.53
percent as of 1:39 p.m. London time, after earlier dropping as
much as four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.48
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
