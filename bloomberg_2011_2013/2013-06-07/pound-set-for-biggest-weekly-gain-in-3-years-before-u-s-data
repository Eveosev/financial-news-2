U.K. government bonds rose, with 10-year yields falling the most in a week, before a U.S. report
that analysts said will show job growth in the world’s biggest
economy slowed last month.  Benchmark yields dropped to the lowest level this month as
speculation the U.S. recovery is waning underpinned demand for
safer assets. The pound weakened for the first time in three
days against the euro after German industrial production
increased the most in a year. Sterling is still headed for its
biggest weekly gain in more than three years against the dollar.
The U.K. sold 2.5 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) of bills.  “The thing that dominates the day will be waiting for and
reacting to the payroll numbers,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a
fixed-income analyst at Investec Bank Plc in  London . “Bad
numbers shouldn’t be positive for anything really but they are
as they lead to easier monetary policy,” which supports gilts.  The U.K. 10-year yield fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.99 percent at 1:03 p.m. London time after
dropping as much as six basis points, the most since May 31. The
1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 rose 0.295, or 2.95
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 97.99. The yield earlier
fell to 1.97 percent, the lowest since May 31.  Gilts handed investors a gain of 0.5 percent in the past
three months through yesterday, according to the Bloomberg World
Bond Indexes. German bonds rose 0.1 percent and U.S. Treasuries
were little changed.  U.S. Payrolls  The U.S. Labor Department will say employers boosted
payrolls by 163,000 in May after adding 165,000 workers the
previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey before the data
is released at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington . The jobless rate held at
a four-year low of 7.5 percent, a separate survey showed.  The pound fell 0.3 percent to 85.14 pence per euro after
appreciating to 84.77 pence yesterday, the strongest since May
21. Sterling weakened 0.2 percent to $1.5570, trimming this
week’s gain to 2.5 percent, still the most since October 2009.  German industrial production jumped 1.8 percent in April
from the previous month, the biggest gain since March 2012, the
 Economy Ministry  said in Berlin. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast no change.  The pound may extend gains versus the dollar if it closes
above last month’s high of $1.5606, according to  Richard Adcock ,
a technical strategist at UBS AG in London.  The moving average convergence/divergence pattern, which
tracks the difference between a shorter- and longer-term moving
average, remains above zero, suggesting further gains, Adcock
wrote in a note to clients. The next “significant” resistance
level is at $1.5789, he wrote, referring to an area where sell
orders may be clustered.  The pound has strengthened 5 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 0.8 percent and the euro strengthened 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
