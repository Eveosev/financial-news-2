U.S.  stocks  rose for the week, ending
back-to-back losses for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as
American companies added more workers to payrolls than
economists forecast, signaling the economy continues to expand.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  increased 2 percent after approving a
$15 billion share buyback program. Gap Inc. jumped 3.8 percent
as it reported same-store sales for May that were higher than
estimates. Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. jumped 3.2
percent as a JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst said the companies’
experimental cancer drugs show promise.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and Verizon
Communications Inc. rallied at least 3.6 percent, pacing gains
among the biggest U.S. companies.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.8 percent to 1,643.38 for the week.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 132.55 points, or 0.9
percent, to 15,248.12. Both gauges slid in the prior two weeks.  The jobs report “was just weak enough to reduce
expectations that the Fed’s going to react and just strong
enough to suggest that the economy is hanging in there,” David Joy, the Boston-based chief market strategist at Ameriprise
Financial Inc., which oversees about $708 billion, said by
telephone. “It was a good report for equities,”  The  S&P 500  erased a weekly loss on the last trading day
after a Labor Department report showed payrolls rose 175,000
last month after a revised 149,000 increase in April that was
smaller than first estimated. The median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey called for a gain of 163,000. The  unemployment rate 
climbed to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent as a surge of people
entering the  labor force  swamped the number of positions
available.  Labor Market  The improvement in the labor market is a sign companies are
looking beyond fiscal restraint this quarter and are optimistic
enough about the prospects for demand in the second half of the
year. At the same time, bigger job and wage gains are needed to
move Federal Reserve policy makers closer to scaling back record
monetary stimulus.  Investors weighed mixed economic data earlier in the week
after a report from ADP Research Institute showed U.S. companies
hired fewer workers than projected in May amid  federal budget 
cuts and higher taxes. Separate data from the Commerce
Department showed U.S. factory orders in April fell short of
estimates. A gauge of  service industries , which covers almost 90
percent of the economy, rose more than forecast.  Telephone Shares  Telephone companies gained the most out of 10 S&P 500
industries, rallying 1.9 percent. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical
Index fell 0.5 percent for the third week of losses and the S&P
Supercomposite Homebuilding Index lost 2.4 percent as all 11
members in the measure slumped.  Fed stimulus and better-than-expected earnings have
propelled the  bull market  in U.S. equities into a fifth year and
driven the S&P 500 up 143 percent from a 12-year low in 2009.
The index has dropped 1.5 percent since closing at a record on
May 21, the day before Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  suggested
the central bank could curtail its $85 billion monthly bond
purchases if the job market improved in a “real and sustainable
way.”  The  Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) , or
VIX, lost 7.1 percent to 15.14 this week. The index, a benchmark
gauge for American  stock options , is down 16 percent this year.  Pfizer, the world’s largest drugmaker, jumped 3.8 percent
to $28.26 for the biggest gain in the Dow. Verizon
Communications gained 3.6 percent to $50.24.  Share Buyback  Wal-Mart gained 2 percent to $76.33, snapping a four-week
stretch of losses. The world’s largest retailer’s new buyback
program replaces the previous $15 billion authorization, which
had about $712 million remaining, the company said in a
statement.  Gap jumped 3.8 percent to $42.09. Total comparable sales
rose 7 percent last month, according to a statement from the
largest U.S. specialty apparel retailer. Analysts had projected
3.7 percent, on average, according to researcher Retail Metrics
Inc.  Health-care companies in the  S&P 500 (SPX)  added 0.8 percent as a
group. Merck rose 3.2 percent to $48.19 and Bristol-Myers Squibb
added 3.2 percent to $47.50 after JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott
said the two have promising cancer immunotherapies.  Bristol-Myers is “well in the lead” with a combination of
Yervoy, a medicine already on the market, with its experimental
immune therapy nivolumab, Schott wrote in a note to investors.
Meanwhile, Merck is rolling forward “the next agent to watch,”
he wrote.  ‘Key Call’  Yum! Brands Inc. climbed 8.5 percent to $73.52. UBS AG
raised its recommendation for the owner of KFC to buy from
neutral and added the company to its U.S. “key call” list,
saying sales and profitability in  China  will start to improve
from the impact of recent health scares in the country.  GameStop Corp. (GME)  jumped 11 percent to $36.75. Microsoft Corp.
responded to concerns about trade-in rights on its new Xbox One
console, saying users may sell titles back to retailers or give
them to friends provided they have approval from the publisher.
Microsoft said only “participating retailers” would broker
trade-ins, which is “particularly positive” for GameStop,
according to Piper Jaffray Cos.’  Michael Olson  in a note.  Iron Mountain Inc. tumbled 19 percent to $28.95 for the
biggest decline in the S&P 500, and Equinix Inc. slumped 5
percent to $192.57. The two technology companies said the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service is scrutinizing their eligibility to
convert to real estate investment trusts.  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM)  sank 6.4 percent to $39.61. The largest
maker of customer-management software agreed to buy ExactTarget
Inc. for about $2.5 billion, its biggest acquisition ever, to
expand in online marketing. The cash offer was 53 percent more
than ExactTarget’s closing price on the day before the deal was
announced.  Zynga Inc. tumbled 16 percent to $2.84. The biggest maker
of online social games said it will cut 520 jobs, or 18 percent
of its staff, and close some offices amid disappointing results
from its titles outside the “FarmVille” series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
