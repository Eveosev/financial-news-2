A weekend of protests in Istanbul's Taksim Square—and in other cities around the country—grabbed international headlines this week and even sparked a brief warning from the often unflappable U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which advised travelers to the city " to avoid all demonstrations ." It's reasonable advice anywhere in the world, but with frightening images of tear gas and flag-waving demonstrators, does Turkey remain a safe place for tourists? ( I get this question all the time, even when there aren't protests .) The short answer, say visitors currently in country, is yes. Condé Nast Traveler  reader Jonathan Pedersen and his son "caught a whiff of tear gas" during dinner on Saturday night, he said by telephone from Istanbul this morning, but they have no plans to change their itinerary, which will continue to Bodrum and Ephesus. "We are having a lovely day touring around the old part of the city, and there is no evidence of any trouble here," Pedersen said. He added that his guide Apo, with whom he was connected by  Turkey travel specialist Earl Starkey  (designer of  Condé Nast Traveler 's Turkey Iconic Itinerary ), was "totally on top of it" with regards to the security situation, which, while fluid, he characterized as normal. "I don't know how much of this is ritualistic political theater, but you kind of get that sense, don't you?" Pedersen asked rhetorically. But in contrast to revolutions that have swept through the Arab world in recent years, the demonstrations in Istanbul are "more akin to the Occupy Wall Street movement," said Starkey, who lives in Istanbul. What started as a protest against a plan to build a shopping mall in Taksim Square, long a center of public life and a frequently visited Istanbul landmark, has become  a flashpoint for simmering discontent about the use of public spaces across the country and frustration over the ten-year rule of Prime Minister Erdogan . Still, other travelers echo Pedersen's sentiments that Turkey is safe. Emilson Alonso, who landed in Istanbul with his family on May 28, spent four days in Istanbul before continuing on to Cappadocia, where he is now. He has seen some TV news reports and gotten updates on the protests from the Web, but "in terms of the trip, the plans, the sightseeing, nothing has changed," Alonso said. "I'm from Brazil, and I'm used to protests, and I used to live in Mexico City, where you have protests every day," he added. "This is nothing." Condé Nast Traveler  reader Greg Tomlinson is nearing the end of a two-week trip through the country, including stops in Istanbul, Fethiye, and Antalya, where he encountered a street blocked by protestors—and simply turned around without a problem. "It's all over the news, but these seem to be, from my perspective, pretty benign demonstrations," he said by telephone from Fethiye. "These things are not the kinds of things that should discourage anyone from coming over," he added. "It's a fabulous country." Staying Safe: The Takeaway Oftentimes, when there are demonstrations or conflagrations in large foreign cities, people in the U.S. assume the whole city or country is unsafe. The media images on which they base their apprehension don't show the huge number of people in that city or country living their normal everyday lives—or the often huge number of tourists on the normal, everyday tourist circuit, unaffected by the incidents. It's easy to perceive greater risk than there actually is. As Baruch Fischhoff, a professor of decision sciences at Carnegie Mellon, told me several years ago, "Every risk has a numerator and a denominator. The numerator is how many people got hurt. The denominator is how many people did not get hurt. The numerator is very visible, because it gets the media attention. The denominator is not, because it's not news. When you're actually in a foreign place, you get a concrete feeling for the extent to which nothing happens there." While there's not nothing happening in Istanbul's Taksim Square, "the rest of the city is functioning absolutely normally," Pedersen said. "There's kind of a happiness that this has happened."
