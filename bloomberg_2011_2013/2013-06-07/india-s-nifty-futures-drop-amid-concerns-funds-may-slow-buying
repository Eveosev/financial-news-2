Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures fell,
signaling benchmark indexes may extend a drop to a five-week
low, amid concerns overseas funds may pare this year’s record
purchases of local shares.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for June delivery dropped 0.4
percent to 5,904 at 10:14 a.m. in  Singapore . The underlying CNX
 Nifty (NIFTY)  Index lost less than 0.1 percent to 5,921.40 yesterday.
The S&P BSE Sensex slid 0.3 percent. The Bank of  New York  Mellon
India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares added 0.7 percent.  The Sensex declined to the lowest level since April 30
yesterday as the rupee weakened to a one-year low on concern the
U.S. Federal Reserve will curb asset purchases that have boosted
foreign inflows into  emerging markets . A weak rupee threatens to
stoke inflation, limiting the  Reserve Bank  of India’s scope to
extend monetary easing and boost an economy that grew at the
slowest pace in a decade last year.  “The easy money coming to some of the emerging markets may
pause, or there could be some second thoughts,” S. Krishnakumar, head of equities at Sundaram Mutual Fund, which
manages $2.6 billion of assets, said from Chennai in south
India. “This is a temporary reaction.”  Overseas investors bought a net $15.3 billion worth of
Indian shares this year through June 5, second only to  Japan 
among Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg. The average foreign
stake in companies in the S&P BSE 200 Index was 17.9 percent on
March 31, the highest quarterly proportion since Bloomberg began
compiling the data in 2009.  Policy Review  Foreign funds bought $28 million of local stocks on June 5,
according to data from the market regulator released yesterday.  The  Reserve Bank of India  cut the benchmark repurchase rate
by 25 basis points on May 3 to 7.25 percent, extending this
year’s decrease to 75 basis points, as inflation eased to a 41-month low in April. The central bank meets for its next policy
review on June 17.  India ’s  gross domestic product  grew 5 percent in the 12
months ended March 31, below the 10-year average of about 8
percent, official data showed May 31.  The Sensex has slumped 3.8 percent since climbing to its
highest level in more than two years on May 17, paring its
annual advance to 0.5 percent. The gauge is valued at 13.4 times
 projected 12-month profits , the cheapest since May 1. That
compares with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 10 times.  Still, earnings growth at India’s largest companies may
exceed forecasts as input and interest costs drop and the
economy recovers, Morgan Stanley and Reliance Mutual Fund
predict.  Profit for the 50 Nifty companies may expand about 16
percent to 18 percent in the year to March 31, said  Ridham Desai , managing director and head of India research at Morgan
Stanley.  Net income growth at the 30 Sensex firms has the
“potential of surprising” the 12 percent to 15 percent
increase forecast by analysts, according to Sunil Singhania,
head of equities at Reliance Capital Asset Management Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
