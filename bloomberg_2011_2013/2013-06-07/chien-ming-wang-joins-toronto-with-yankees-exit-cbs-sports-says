Pitcher Chien-Ming Wang signed with
the  Toronto Blue Jays  after being granted his release from the
 New York Yankees , CBSSports.com reported.  Wang, who signed a minor-league contract with the Yankees
in March containing an opt-out clause, will make his first start
next week, the  website said , without citing a source of its
information.  Yankees spokesman Jason Latimer confirmed in an e-mail that
Wang exercised the opt-out clause. Blue Jays spokesman Jay Stenhouse said in an e-mail that the team hadn’t announced
Wang’s signing.  Wang, a right-hander from Taiwan, played for the Yankees
from 2005 to 2009, posting a 55-26 record in 104 starts with a
4.16 earned run average. He won 19 games in both 2006 and 2007
before injuring his foot running the bases in a 2008 game, and
went 1-6 in 2009.  He left the Yankees as a free agent after that season and
played for the  Washington Nationals  in 2011 and 2012.  The 33-year-old Wang went 4-4 with a 2.33 earned run
average in eight Triple-A starts this season.  Toronto is 25-34 this season, 11 games behind the American
League East-leading Boston Red Sox. The Yankees are 35-25, 1 1/2
games out of the AL East lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
