Hog futures, trading little changed,
headed for the fourth straight weekly gain on signs of
increasing demand from U.S. meatpackers amid tight supplies.
Cattle prices fell.  Meatpackers processed 1.617 million hogs in the first four
days of this week, up 0.2 percent a year earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Spot  hogs  headed for the
seventh straight weekly increase, the longest rally since at
least January 2004, government figures show. Yesterday, futures
reached a 23-month high.  “Supplies continue to be seasonally tight, so packers have
to compete for supply,” Doug Houghton, a commodity analyst at
Brock Associates, said in a telephone interview from  Milwaukee .
“Demand is good enough that they have orders.”  Hog futures for July settlement fell less than 0.1 percent
to 95.775 cents a pound at 9:57 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Yesterday, the price touched 96.4 cents, the highest
for a most-active contract since July 7, 2011. A fourth weekly
gain would mark the longest rally since in more than two months.  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.4 percent to
$1.1955 a pound. Through yesterday, the commodity dropped 9.3
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement declined 0.4
percent to $1.441 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
