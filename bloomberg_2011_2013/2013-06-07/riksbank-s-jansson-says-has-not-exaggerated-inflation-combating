Sweden ’s Riksbank Deputy Governor Per Jansson defended the central bank’s record on inflation and said
it was within its mandate to also focus on debt imbalances when
setting  interest rates .  The policy maker said that “the Riksbank has not
exaggerated its inflation combating and that the average outcome
for inflation must be regarded as acceptable, in that a large
part of the deviation from target is due to interest rates
falling more than they have risen,” according to a text
released by the Stockholm-based bank today.  Sweden’s central bank said in April it probably will keep
its repo rate at 1 percent at its next meeting in July while not
ruling out a fifth rate cut since 2011. Policymakers are trying
to spur inflation closer to a 2 percent target without fueling
household credit growth.  Jansson also said in his speech in the Swedish capital that
 “the experiences of other countries in connection with the
financial crisis show that excessive debt can result in a
situation with weak demand, high unemployment and low
inflation,” and “giving consideration to risks in this area is
thus entirely in line with the Riksbank’s objectives and
mandate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
