Futures traders increased bets that
 Australia ’s dollar will weaken against its U.S. counterpart to
the most on record going back to 1993 as yield differentials
between the two currencies’ government debt shrink.  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in Australia’s currency
compared with those on a gain, known as net shorts, was 58,550
contracts on June 4, compared with 42,307 a week earlier,
figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading
Commission show.  Yields on 10-year Australian government bonds tightened to
1.08 percentage points relative to similar-maturity Treasuries,
the narrowest spread since November 2008. Investors are paring
holdings of higher-yielding assets amid speculation that the
Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus measures that have weakened
the dollar and lowered interest rates.  The Aussie dropped 1 percent to 96.06 per dollar in New
York. It is down 0.7 percent this week and off 8.6 percent this
year.  Bets the British pound will decline against the greenback
increased to the most since at least 1992. Net shorts on the
British pound rose to 77,738 contracts on June 4, compared with
74,525 a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
