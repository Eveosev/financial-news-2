The spread between light and heavy
crudes on the U.S.  Gulf Coast  widened to the highest level in
two months.  Light Louisiana Sweet, the benchmark light crude on the
Gulf, strengthened by $1.18 compared with Mexican Maya, the key
heavy oil imported to the Gulf, to a $8.80-a-barrel  premium  at
1:57 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It’s the highest level since April 3.  The widening spread could be a sign of Mexico trying to
maintain its crude market share in the U.S., said Amy Myers Jaffe, executive director of energy and sustainability at the
University of  California , Davis.  Petroleos Mexicanos , Mexico’s national oil company better
known as Pemex, adjusts the price of Maya at the start of every
month to make sure the crude is attractive to buyers. The LLS-Maya spread widened $2.35 a barrel on June 3, the first trading
day of the month.  “Pemex is trying to make sure their barrels don’t get
backed out of the Gulf Coast, because the netback for them to
sell to  Asia  is really terrible,” Jaffe said.  The U.S. imported 608,000 barrels a day of crude from
Mexico in March, down 30 percent from the previous month and the
lowest level since April 1990, according to U.S. Energy
Information Administration  data . The level dropped to 439,000
barrels last week, preliminary EIA data show.  Biggest Customer  “The biggest customer for Mexican crude is U.S. Gulf Coast
refiners,” said Ken Medlock, senior director of the Baker
Institute’s Center for Energy Studies at  Rice University  in
Houston. “To the extent that you see demand pressures working
against imports, you may see Mexico drop prices a little to try
to maintain market share.”  The LLS-Maya gap averaged $6.14 a barrel in May, below an
$11.46 mark over the past year and the lowest monthly average
since January 2012.  The  premium  of LLS to West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , grew 60 cents to $9.60 a barrel. That’s down from a
year-to-date high of $23 on Feb. 22. Heavy Louisiana Sweet also
increased 60 cents to a $9.80 premium.  Mars Blend and Poseidon premiums to WTI widened 35 cents to
$4.50 and $4, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
