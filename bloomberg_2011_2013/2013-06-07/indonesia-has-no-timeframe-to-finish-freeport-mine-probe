Indonesian authorities investigating
the cause of an accident that killed 28 people at  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ’s Grasberg complex have yet to reach
a conclusion and haven’t set a timeframe to complete the probe.  Technical discussions continue and data is still being
gathered, Thamrin Sihite, director general of coal and minerals
at the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry, told reporters in
Jakarta today. Grasberg, the world’s second-biggest copper mine,
will stay shut until the government gets the results of an
independent probe, Sihite said June 5.  The ministry is “result oriented, not time oriented,”
Sihite said today.  Investigators are seeking the cause of a tunnel collapse on
May 14 at Grasberg, which also produces gold. Another worker
died June 1 from a separate accident when material overflowed
from an ore bin and covered a truck during maintenance activity.  Freeport declined 1.5 percent to $30.57 at 9:58 a.m. in
Toronto.  The shares  have fallen 11 percent this year.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Escondida mine in  Chile  is the largest
copper mine.  To contact the reporters on this story:
