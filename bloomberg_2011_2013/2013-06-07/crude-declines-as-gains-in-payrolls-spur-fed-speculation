West Texas Intermediate crude rose to
a two-week high on speculation that demand for fuel will climb
after U.S. employment gained more than forecast.  Futures capped a 4.4 percent weekly increase after the
Labor Department reported payrolls advanced 175,000 in May,
beating the 163,000 median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The  unemployment rate  climbed to 7.6 percent from 7.5
percent in April as more Americans entered the  labor force . Oil
also gained with U.S. equities.  “We finally got some decent economic news,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy. “We have an upside surprise and
the market is taking off. Given the momentum and strength that
we are seeing generally, we can make a run to $100.”  WTI for July delivery advanced $1.27, or 1.3 percent, to
close at $96.03 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
the highest settlement since May 21. The volume of all futures
traded was 52 percent above the 100-day average for the time of
day at 2:34 p.m. The weekly gain was the first since May 10.  Brent for July settlement rose 95 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
settle at $104.56 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Volume was 13 percent above the 100-day
average. Brent’s  premium to WTI  shrank 32 cents to $8.53.  The payroll increase in May followed a revised 149,000
increase in April that was smaller than first estimated.
Retailers added jobs in May, the report showed.  ‘Good Sign’  “The jobs report is better than expectations and it’s a
good sign for fuel demand,” said  Michael Lynch , president of
Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
 Massachusetts . “It’s a boost for the market.”  The household survey, used to calculate the  unemployment
rate , showed a 420,000 increase in the size of the labor force,
pushing up the jobless rate.  “The gain in payrolls is more than expected and is
positive for oil,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker
at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  both jumped more than 1 percent. It was the
biggest advance for the  S&P 500  in seven weeks.  “The stock market is pushing higher and oil is tracking
the stock market,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
the Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The jobs report is better
than expected and it’s helping oil.”  Demand Rising  U.S.  total petroleum consumption  increased 2.7 percent last
week to 18.8 million barrels a day, the Energy Information
Administration said on June 5. Crude  inventories  fell 6.27
million barrels to 391.3 million, the biggest drop since
December. It reached an 82-year high the prior week.  “Inventories, although still high, are coming down, and
you have an improving economy here in the U.S.,” Kilduff said.  Crude fell earlier as the dollar strengthened against the
euro on concern that the  Federal Reserve  will slow its stimulus
policies. The bank has expanded its balance sheet to a record
$3.4 trillion with $85 billion of asset purchases a month, known
as quantitative easing, to spur growth and reduce unemployment.  “It’s not a bad report and the prospect of the Fed
tapering quantitative easing is looming out there,” said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based energy consultant.  Assessing Progress  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 that the
central bank is trying to assess whether it has seen “real and
sustainable progress in the labor market outlook.” If it has,
the Fed could “take a step down” in its pace of purchases in
the “next few meetings,” he said.  The dollar strengthened 0.2 percent against the euro after
paring an increase of 0.4 percent to $1.3192. A stronger dollar
reduces oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  WTI futures ranged from $91.26 to $95.92 for the past two
weeks before breaking above $96 today.  “The market has been moving sideways for a few days and
the reason is market participants are really trying to figure
out what the Fed is going to do next,” Schenker said. “No one
is sure, not even the Fed.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
July was 19.8 percent, compared with 21.8 percent yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 766,682
contracts as of 3:11 p.m. It totaled 685,952 contracts
yesterday, 15 percent higher than three-month average. Open
interest was 1.78 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
