German stocks  were little changed,
paring earlier gains, as investors awaited data on U.S. payrolls
and German industrial production.  The  DAX (DAX)  rose less than 0.1 percent to 8,102.88 at 9:46 a.m.
in  Frankfurt . The gauge has still fallen 3 percent this week.
The DAX rallied in all but one of the past 12 months as central
banks around the world maintained stimulus efforts. The broader
HDAX Index added less than 0.1 percent.  German industrial production stagnated in April after a 1.2
percent rise the previous month, according to economists before
the report at 12 p.m. Frankfurt time.  In the U.S., a Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington  will probably show that companies boosted payrolls by
163,000 workers last month, after hiring by 165,000 in April,
according to the median forecast from 90 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. The  unemployment rate  held at a four-year
low of 7.5 percent, according to the survey.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  in May suggested
the central bank could curtail its bond buying if the job market
improves in a “real and sustainable way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
