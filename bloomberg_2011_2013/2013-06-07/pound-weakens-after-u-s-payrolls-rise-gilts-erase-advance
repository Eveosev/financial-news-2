The pound fell the most in two weeks
against the dollar after American employers added more jobs in
May than economists forecast, weakening the case for further
Federal Reserve stimulus that would debase the U.S. currency.  Sterling dropped from near the strongest since February
versus the greenback as the Labor Department said U.S. payrolls
climbed by 175,000 after a revised 149,000 increase in April.
The pound weakened for the first time in three days against the
euro after German industrial production rose the most in a year.
U.K. government bonds fell as the Debt Management Office said in
an e-mailed statement it will offer a new security maturing in
July 2068 via banks in the week of June 24.  “Nonfarm payrolls is up about 10,000 above what it was
forecast to be,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the
corporate and institutional treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc
in  London . “It makes sense for the dollar to be bought back up
a bit against the pound.”  Sterling fell 0.4 percent to $1.5545 at 4:56 p.m. London
time after declining 0.7 percent, the biggest drop since May 22.
The U.K. currency has still gained 2.3 percent this week, the
most since October 2009. It climbed to $1.5684 yesterday, the
highest since Feb. 13. The pound weakened 0.2 percent to 85.05
pence per euro.  Sterling has strengthened 5.3 percent in the past three
months, the best performer of 10 developed-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 1.3 percent and the euro strengthened 2.3 percent.  Jobless Rate  While U.S. payrolls increased, the  unemployment rate  rose
to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent. Fed policy makers have said
they’ll maintain their $85 billion-a-month pace of asset
purchases until the labor outlook improves “substantially.”  German industrial production jumped 1.8 percent in April
from the previous month, the biggest gain since March 2012, the
 Economy Ministry  said in Berlin.  The U.K. 10-year yield climbed five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.07 percent. The 1.75 percent bond due in
September 2022 declined 0.38, or 3.80 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 97.315.  Gilts returned 0.5 percent in the past three months through
yesterday, according to the Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German
bonds rose 0.1 percent and U.S. Treasuries were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
