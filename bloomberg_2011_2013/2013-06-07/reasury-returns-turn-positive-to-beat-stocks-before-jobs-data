Treasuries advanced, extending their
first weekly gain since April, before a government report that
economists said will show U.S. job growth slowed last month.  Benchmark  10-year yields  approached the lowest in two weeks
as signs the recovery is losing momentum prompts investors to
pare bets the Federal Reserve will end bond purchases. The yield
jumped 11 basis points on May 22 when Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said officials may taper bond purchases if they become
confident gains in the economy will be sustained. A measure of
volatility in Treasuries reached the highest since June 2012.  “If you look at the consensus expectations, it’s not going
to be a too stellar number in terms of what we’ve had,” said
Rasmus Rousing, a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse Group
AG in Zurich. “The re-pricing that we saw after Bernanke was
quite significant and we simply don’t see that in the longer
term that these levels are sustainable.”  The 10-year  yield  dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.06 percent at 7:24 a.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent
security maturing in May 2023 gained 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000
face amount, to 97 9/32.  The yield has declined seven basis points this week, the
first drop since the period ended April 26. It fell to 1.99
percent yesterday, the lowest since May 24. The 10-year rate may
drop to 2 percent in 12 months, Credit Suisse’s Rousing said.  Job Growth  U.S. employers added 163,000 workers in May, down from
165,000 in April, based on a Bloomberg News survey of analysts
before the Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .
Gains have slowed after rising by 332,000 in February. The
unemployment rate will hold at a four-year low of 7.5 percent, a
separate survey showed.  Treasuries tumbled after the previous jobs report on May 3,
when the increase of 165,000 for April topped the forecast of
140,000 projected by a Bloomberg survey. The Labor Department
revised March’s reading to 138,000 from 88,000 and the jobless
rate unexpectedly dropped.  “If we see continued improvement, and we have confidence
that is going to be sustained, we could in the next few meetings
take a step down in our pace of purchases,” Bernanke told the
Joint Economic Committee of Congress on May 22. He also said
tightening policy too soon would endanger the recovery.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index climbed to 84.75 yesterday, the highest
since June 18, 2012. It has averaged 62.5 in the past 12 months.  Risk Index  Bank of America Corp.’s market risk  index  covering global
equities, commodities, bonds and currencies was negative 0.47
yesterday, matching the highest level since August. It is still
less than the average for the past decade, which is about zero.  “Because of market volatility, people are going back to
safe assets,” said Genzo Kimura, an investor in  Tokyo  at
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust, which oversees the equivalent of $43.6
billion. “The U.S. Treasury is a safe asset.”  Loomis Sayles & Co. is buying 30-year Treasuries, betting
the U.S. central bank will maintain its stimulus program.  The Fed’s bond-buying plan “will be around longer than the
market thought,” Matt Eagan, a co-portfolio manager of the
company’s Strategic Alpha Fund and Strategic Income Fund, told
reporters in  London . “The economy is not strong enough despite
the recovery. The market is getting ahead of itself. Even if the
Fed starts to taper, they will still be injecting liquidity into
the market.”  Treasuries handed investors a loss of 0.8 percent this year
through yesterday, according to the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond
Index. (BUSY)  The MSCI All-Country World Index of shares gained 8.2
percent including reinvested dividends, data compiled by
