Thailand ’s baht was set for a seventh
weekly slide, the longest run of losses since February 2009, and
 government bonds  fell on bets foreign funds will trim holdings
of local assets should the  Federal Reserve  reduce stimulus.  Global funds sold $568 million more of Thai equities than
they bought this week through yesterday, exchange data show.
Somchai Sujjapongse, director general of the finance ministry’s
fiscal policy office, said June 5 outflows are expected to be
temporary and the government has prepared measures to handle
inflows when they resume. The baht has dropped 6.6 percent from
a 16-year high reached in April on concern policy makers will
impose  capital controls  to curb excessive market volatility.  “Investors are unwinding their positions on riskier assets
amid speculation on whether the Fed will reduce its stimulus,”
said  Koji Fukaya , chief executive officer and foreign-exchange
strategist at FPG Securities Co. in Tokyo. “In the case of
Thailand, there’s lingering concern about capital controls.”  The baht declined 0.8 percent this week to 30.58 per dollar
as of 8:28 a.m. in Bangkok and touched 30.66 earlier, the
weakest level since Jan. 2, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
currency rose 0.1 percent today. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, this
week and eight basis points today to 6.34 percent.  Central Bank  Bank of Thailand has prepared measures to combat baht
volatility although they may not be used if they aren’t
necessary, Assistant Governor Paiboon Kittisrikangwan said May
29. The currency touched 28.56 on April 19 and April 22, the
strongest level since July 1997.  Global funds  pulled  a net $639 million from sovereign debt
since the end of April after net purchases of almost $12 billion
in the first four months of 2013, according to the Thai Bond
Market Association.  The yield on the 3.625 percent notes due June 2023 rose six
basis points this week to 3.57 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The rate was little changed today.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on May 22 that the U.S.
central bank could taper its $85 billion a month of bond
purchases if the nation’s employment outlook shows sustainable
improvement. Labor Department data today may show U.S. firms
added 163,000 jobs in May, compared with 165,000 the previous
month, according to the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
