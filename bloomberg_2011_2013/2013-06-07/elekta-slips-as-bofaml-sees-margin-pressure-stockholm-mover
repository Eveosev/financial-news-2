Elekta AB (EKTAB)  fell the most in three
months as Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch said
profitability at the maker of radiation-surgery equipment could
be disappointing, due to research spending and pricing pressure.  Elekta declined as much as 5 percent, the steepest intraday
fall since March 5, and was trading down 4 percent at 102.60
kronor at 10:56 a.m. in Stockholm. Trading volume was 63 percent
of the three-month daily average.  “We view ongoing double-digit top-line growth as already
reflected in consensus and believe operating margins could
disappoint,” Justin Morris, an analyst at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, said in a note.  Elekta is increasing expenditures on research and
development to maintain market-share gains while gross margins
are under pressure by price competition, Morris said. He lowered
his rating on the stock to underperform from neutral.  Elekta’s shares have risen 1.2 percent this year, giving
the Stockholm-based company a market value of 39 billion kronor
($6.0 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
