The trustee for convicted Ponzi
scheme mastermind  Bernard Madoff ’s defunct brokerage, who has
appealed a ruling by a Manhattan federal judge that permits  New
York  Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to complete a $410
million settlement with Madoff investor J. Ezra Merkin, accused
the judge of “abuse of discretion” in saying the trustee
waited too long to stop the deal.  Trustee Irving Picard said he wasn’t trying to stop the
settlement “for all time,” only until he had taken money from
Merkin. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff also erred in “holding
that the trustee had an obligation to rush to the courthouse and
file suit,” rather than negotiating with Schneiderman for a
delay, as he had tried to do, Picard said in a filing with the
 U.S. Court of Appeals  in New York yesterday.  The settlement will compensate Merkin investors who lost
money in the  Ponzi scheme  and aren’t eligible for compensation
from the Madoff estate run by Picard, the attorney general has
said. Picard, who also has appealed rulings barring him from
collecting $30 billion from banks, seeks to take $500 million
from Merkin for a different set of Madoff investors. Rakoff
dismissed what he called Picard’s entire effort to “derail” the
accord, saying that by law, he waited too long to assert his own
claim as trustee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
