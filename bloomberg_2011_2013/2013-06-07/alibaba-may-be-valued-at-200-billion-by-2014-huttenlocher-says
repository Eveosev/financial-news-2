Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.,  China ’s
largest e-commerce company, may have a market value of as much
as $200 billion by the end of 2014 after an initial public
offering, said Carl Huttenlocher, chief investment officer of
hedge-fund company Myriad Asset Management Ltd.  SoftBank Corp. (9984) , a Tokyo-based wireless carrier with a 35
percent stake in Alibaba, may see its market value boosted by as
much as 75 percent as a result, according to Huttenlocher, whose
Hong Kong-based company now manages $2.3 billion of assets.  Alibaba may have an IPO this or next year that values the
Hangzhou, eastern China-based company at as much as $100
billion, rivaling the $104 billion Facebook Inc. got at its May
2012  IPO (FB)  price, analysts including Eric Qiu at Guosen Securities
Co. have said. Facebook has a market value of $55.5 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Alibaba, which made founder Jack Ma a billionaire, will
benefit from China’s expanding retail market, increasing use of
Internet and smartphones, and a fragmented retail market,
Huttenlocher said. Ma said last year that the company may go
public within five years.  “It’s much easier to gain share in a fast-growing pie,”
he said at the first  Karen Leung Memorial Investor Conference  in
Hong Kong yesterday. “The e-commerce market in China is an
enormous and very fast growing market that we feel is also
getting share from the offline retail market. Alibaba is the
dominant company in the sector and has pricing power.”  Internet Buying  Retail sales in China are growing 14 percent a year,
against 3 percent in the U.S., Huttenlocher, a former Asia head
of New York-based Highbridge Capital Management LLC, said.  About 42 percent of Chinese use the Internet now, compared
with more than 80 percent in the U.S., he said. The top 20
traditional offline retailers in China command less than 10
percent of the market share, lower than the 40 percent to 50
percent in the U.S., he said.  The projection of a market value of $150 billion to $200
billion by end-2014 assumes 14 percent of Chinese retail sales
will be conducted online by 2015, Huttenlocher said. Alibaba,
especially its Tmall.com unit, may have a shrinking share of a
bigger market yet it also takes into account its pricing power
as the dominant e-commerce company, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
