Soybeans gained, set for a sixth
weekly advance, the longest such rally in four years, as
increased demand from importers drained supply from last year’s
crop. Corn and wheat declined.  Soybeans for delivery in July, before this year’s harvest,
rose 0.3 percent to $15.325 a bushel by 10:11 a.m. in  Singapore ,
taking the weekly advance to 1.5 percent. Futures haven’t seen
six straight weekly gains since June 2009.  Exporters in the U.S., set to regain its ranking as the top
grower and shipper, already sold 36.62 million metric tons of
the 36.74 million tons the government predicted will be shipped
by Aug. 31, the Department of Agriculture said. Cumulative sales
through May 30 are up 260,600 tons from a year earlier, before
the country was hit by the worst drought since the 1930s.  “Supply of old-crop soybeans is quite tight,”  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at Astmax Asset Management Inc.
said from  Tokyo  today. “People are waiting for much higher
prices. There’s no reason to sell for now.”  Inventories of soybeans in the U.S. will plunge 26 percent
to 125 million bushels (3.39 million tons) before this year’s
harvest, the smallest in nine years, the USDA said May 10. The
Washington-based agency may pare that estimate to 124 million
bushels when it updates its outlook on June 12, according to the
average estimate of as many as 30 analysts and trading firms
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Corn for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to $5.475 a
bushel in  Chicago , set for a 3.4 percent loss this week. Wheat
for July delivery slid 0.2 percent to $6.965 a bushel for a 1.3
percent loss this week.  Importers including  South Korea  and  Mexico   canceled 
purchases of U.S. wheat, resulting in a net reduction in export
 sales  of about 33,200 tons in the week ended May 30, the USDA
said yesterday. That cut the total sales for delivery in the
year ended May 31 to 27.098 million tons, it said.  The cancellations were reported by exporters after the USDA
said an unauthorized, genetically modified strain was found in
Oregon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
