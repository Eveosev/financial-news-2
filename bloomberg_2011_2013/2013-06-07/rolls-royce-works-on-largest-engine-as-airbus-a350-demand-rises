Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/) , the sole
engine provider on the Airbus SAS A350 due to fly for the first
time in days, will begin testing parts of its most powerful
engine yet as demand rebounds for the plane’s stretch version.  The engine for the A350-1000, the largest version, will be
an upgrade of the turbine now installed on the test plane Airbus
is preparing for first flight, said Chris Young, Rolls’s program
director. An engine to show output can grow to 97,000 pounds of
thrust from 84,000 pounds will run soon, he said.  Rolls-Royce’s stakes are high on the Airbus long-range
plane, where it remains the only engine provider with
exclusivity rights on the -1000 type. The large jet, which aims
to take on the  Boeing Co. (BA)  777-300ER powered by General Electric
Corp., has booked a series of commitments from  Cathay Pacific (293) 
Airways Ltd and British Airways after previously slower sales.  “The -1000 is really starting to gain market acceptance,”
Young said. “It is all about growing the engine now to 97,000
pounds of thrust.”  The TrentXWB-97, as the A350-1000s turbine is called, will
introduce a larger engine core, new coatings and a novel
adaptive coating system to deliver the enhanced performance,
Young said. Many of those technologies will be demonstrated this
year using a current-standard engine, before the first proper
model enters testing next year, he said.  Wide-Body Reliance  Rolls-Royce has bet heavily on the large airliner market
after reducing its role in the single-aisle segment last year
with the exit from the International Aero Engines joint venture.
The new Airbus long-range jet has been its most successful
program, with sales to power more than 600 planes, including 110
A350-1000s.  Like the current A350-900 engine, the larger version will
first fly on an Airbus A380 where one of four Trent 900
superjumbo engines will be replaced with a TrentXWB to gather
data. The A350-1000’s maiden flight is due 2016, Young said.  Rolls plans to start building engines for the first A350
customer plane to go to Qatar Airways Plc. in the fourth
quarter.  Rolls, which lost out to GE to power Boeing’s renewal of
the popular 777 long-range plane, expects the Chicago-based
planemaker to launch the 787-10X, the largest Dreamliner model,
said Pam Robertshaw, program executive for the Trent 1000 that
powers the Dreamliner.  Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA) , which plans to
buy 30 787-10s once Boeing formally approves the program, said
on June 7 that it picked Rolls engines.  The new engine, called the Trent 1000-TEN, will feature
technology pioneered on the A350 powerplant. Rolls-Royce will
introduce the first development engine of the -TEN program at
the end of this year, Robertshaw said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
