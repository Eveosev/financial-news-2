Angola , Africa’s biggest oil producer
after Nigeria, plans to merge agencies for tax collection and
customs by 2017 to help reduce its dependence on petroleum,
according to an analyst at the  London School of Economics .  Tariffs on oil will account for about 80 percent of tax
revenue this year, Emily Anderson, a researcher at LSE, said in
a presentation today in Luanda, the capital. The government is
integrating its agencies to help boost tax earnings from non-oil
industries to 20 percent of gross domestic product within four
years from 7.5 percent in 2011, she said.  “The Angolan government has relied on revenues from the
easy-to-tax oil industry,” said Anderson, who is writing a book
on post-civil war tax reforms in Mozambique and Angola. “The
tax base here remains very narrow and increasing receipts from
other sectors will be critical for maintaining stability.”  Angola is rebuilding its $114 billion economy after a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002. It pumped 1.87 million
barrels of crude a day in May, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The government has separate tax regimes for the  petroleum
industry , negotiated with companies including  Total SA (FP) ,  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  BP Plc. (BP/)  In mining, corporate taxes were cut in
November to 25 percent from 35 percent.  Gilberto Luther, associate director of the government’s tax
reform project, confirmed the merger of the revenue agencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
