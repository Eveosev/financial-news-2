The celebration of  World Environment Day , on June 5, was, as it is every year, the occasion for living high-mindedly, for making resolutions that never endure and for pledging penance for sins of carbon and consumption.  For the past 40 years, the United Nations Environment Program has diligently found a "theme" for June 5 every year to focus global awareness on the environment. These phrases vary in their scope and in imperative intensity. Sometimes they're just plain nouns (human settlements, 1975; desertification, 1984). More recently, they've incorporated a call to action: "Our Earth -- Our Future -- Just Save It!" (1999), "Kick The Habit -- Towards A Low Carbon Economy" (2008) and, my favorite, "Your Planet Needs You -- UNite to Combat Climate Change" (2010). That's the story of the UN right there: fantastically good intentions UNdone by self-congratulation and rhetorical excess. This  year's theme  is especially hortatory, beginning with four consecutive verbs before settling on an object: "Think.Eat.Save. Reduce Your Foodprint." The UNEP website  explains : There isn't a very logical argument in these sentences, with their implication that reducing food wastage would result in hungry people getting the food they need or the absence of distinctions between different situations that might seem to constitute wastage. There's a world of difference between the meal left unfinished at the restaurant table and the produce that spoils on an Indian farm for want of adequate cold-storage facilities. A much better elaboration of the nuances of this theme was provided by the Indian environmentalist Sunita Narain on the website of the Indian environmental magazine Down To Earth. In a piece called " Eating right to save the planet ," Narain looked at the theme from the point of view of the developing world: Narain's views reflect the decentralizing ethos of Indian environmentalism, a  set of diverse schools  whose origins and concerns make for a narrative very different from the environmentalism of the West over the last four decades. Good overviews of the trajectory of the Indian movement can be found both in Narain's 2002 essay " Changing environmentalism " and the Indian historian Ramachandra Guha's " The Rise and Fall of Indian Environmentalism ." Environmentalisms across the world all stress ecological consciousness, sustainability and conservation of scarce natural resources, but as Guha explains: To get a sense of the range of modern Indian environmentalism and its contributions, you might start with  Mahatma Gandhi 's  prescient (if austere) thinking about  industrialism , agrarianism and ethical consumption. There also is the work of  Anil Agarwal ,  Madhav Gadg il ,  Chandi Prasad Bhatt ,  Vandana Shiva ,  Amita Baviskar ,  Darryl D'Monte  and Mahesh Rangarajan. (A single go-to book might be Guha's overview from 2006, " How Much Should a Person Consume ?" ) The ideas of many of these thinkers animated the debates at a small  seminar  in central New Delhi on World Environment Day. A group of environmentalists was brought together by a local organization,  Green Circle of Delhi , to offer a vision of the year 2025. One thinker drew attention to the city's prolonged  mismanagement of its river, the Yamuna . Another outlined the problems with the failed experiment in 2008 with a  bus rapid transit system . A third drew attention to the  establishment  in the last decade of two large biodiversity parks and pointed to trade-offs forced by rapid urbanization and migration. A fourth asked if the municipal corporation's beautification drives, combined with the  eviction  of the poor from unauthorized settlements, didn't amount to a kind of  bourgeois environmentalism . These thoughts seemed more grounded and more cogent than those advanced by UNEP's 2013 campaign.  If "India is a macrocosm, and may be the worldâ€™s default setting for the future," as the writer Patrick French claims in his recent book " India: A Portrait ," then the local debates might be extrapolated to other environmental movements, particularly in the developing world. As Gunnel Cederlof and Mahesh Rangarajan  write  in a recent issue of the journal Conservation & Society: Now there's a theme for a future World Environment Day: "India and China: UNpleasant environmental questions."
