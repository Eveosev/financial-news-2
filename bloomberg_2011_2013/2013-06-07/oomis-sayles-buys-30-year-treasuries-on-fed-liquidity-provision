Loomis Sayles & Co. is buying 30-year
Treasury bonds on a bet that the  Federal Reserve  will continue
printing money, according to money manager, Matt Eagan.  The Fed’s bond-buying plan “will be around longer than the
market thought,” Eagan, who is co-portfolio manager of the
Loomis Sayles Strategic Alpha Fund and Strategic Income Fund,
told reporters in London today. “The economy is not strong
enough despite the recovery. The market is getting ahead of
itself. Even if the Fed starts to taper, they will still be
injecting liquidity into the market.”  The firm is increasing its duration risk, Eagan said.
Duration is a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to changes in
interest rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
