General Electric Co. (GE)  Chief Financial
Officer Keith Sherin will take over as head of the company’s
finance unit as soon as this summer, according to a person
familiar with the situation.  He will succeed Mike Neal, 60, who plans to step down as GE
Capital chief executive officer, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the move hasn’t been publicly
announced. GE Capital CFO Jeff Bornstein will replace Sherin,
54, at GE, the person said.  The transition will come as GE Capital faces more scrutiny
from the Federal Reserve, which identified it as a potential
risk to the financial system this week. Sherin also will lead
efforts to further shrink the unit as GE CEO Jeff Immelt focuses
on boosting profit from industrial products such as jet engines,
locomotives and medical scanners.  Seth Martin, a spokesman for Fairfield, Connecticut-based
GE, declined to comment on the moves. The Wall Street Journal
reported the changes yesterday.  GE Capital had $538 billion in assets as of March 31,
larger than all but six U.S. banks, according to data compiled
by the Fed. The unit posted profit of $7.4 billion on $46
billion in revenue last year.  Immelt has pledged to reduce ending net investment, a
measure of GE Capital’s balance sheet that excludes non-interest-bearing liabilities and cash, by more than 25 percent
to as little as $300 billion by the end of next year.  GE may divest some GE Capital businesses through an initial
public offering, Immelt said at a conference with analysts and
investors last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
