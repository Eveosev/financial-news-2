Dubai, the U.A.E's capital of bling, might be best known for zillion-star hotels, but for a different taste,  Frying Pan Adventures  offers the city's first food tours. Food fanatic Arva Ahmed leads three- to four-hour crawls around old Dubai, where you'll sample treats from the Middle East and beyond: flaky Egyptian sweet-cheese-filled  fiteer  pastry; bumpy, chewy Iranian  sangak  bread; and  momos —pan-fried Nepalese dumplings. Since many places lack signs and even addresses, Ahmed's guidance is invaluable, and you'll get to eat with your hands and actually walk—a novelty in this car-crazy metropolis (tours, $95 per person).
