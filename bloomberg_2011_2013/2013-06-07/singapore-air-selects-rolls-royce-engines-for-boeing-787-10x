Singapore Airlines Ltd. (SIA)  selected
 Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/)  engines to power the 30  Boeing Co. (BA) 
787-10X jets it ordered last week as the first buyer of the new
Dreamliner model and for planes at discount subsidiary Scoot.  Southeast Asia’s biggest carrier chose the Trent 1000
engines over a General Electric Corp. engine available for the
aircraft, Singapore Air said in a statement today. The order is
conditional upon Boeing formally launching the 787-10X.  Singapore Air last week agreed to order 30 Boeing 787-10Xs
and 30 more Airbus SAS A350-900s, also powered by the London-based engine maker, as the region’s economic growth spurs  travel
demand . Chief Executive Officer Goh Choon Phong is adding more
planes and has upgraded business-class cabins as he faces
increasing competition from Emirates and other airlines
expanding in  Southeast Asia .  Rolls-Royce will provide Trent 1000s also to power the 20
787s Singapore Air’s Scoot Pte unit will operate from next year,
the carrier said.  Singapore Air signed a letter of intent with Rolls-Royce
for a service package for both deals. Under the agreement,
Rolls-Royce will be responsible for the provision of
maintenance, repair and overhaul services for the engines, as
well as for spare engine support, the airline said.  Singapore Air  shares  fell 1.05 percent to S$10.35 in the
city today, before the announcement. The stock has dropped 3.7
percent this year.  Last week’s agreement with Boeing comprises 30 firm-ordered
787-10Xs for delivery from the 2018-19 financial year. The deal
with Airbus comprises 30 firm-ordered A350-900s, on top of 40
placed previously, for delivery from the 2016-17 financial year,
plus options for 20 more. The options may be converted into firm
orders for larger A350-1000s on which Rolls-Royce is the
exclusive engine provider.  Rolls also provides the engines for Singapore Air’s A380
superjumbos and last year opened a turbine assembly facility in
the city-state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
