TiVo Inc. (TIVO) , the digital-video-recorder
pioneer, settled a patent dispute with Google Inc.’s Motorola
Mobility unit, Cisco Systems Inc. and  Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC)  for
$490 million.  TiVo has agreed to enter into certain patent-licensing
arrangements with Cisco and Google, the company said today in a
statement. The payment will bring the total from awards and
settlements related to the use of certain parts of TiVo’s
intellectual property to about $1.6 billion. The company also
said it has authorized a $200 million stock-buyback plan.  The settlement averts a trial that was scheduled to start
next week, and eliminates one of the last holdouts in licensing
Alviso, California-based TiVo’s technology.  “We are pleased to reach an agreement that brings our
pending litigation to an end and further underscores the
significant value our distribution partners derive from TiVo’s
technological innovations,” Tom Rogers, chief executive
officer, said in the statement. “Further, this settlement
significantly enhances our already strong balance sheet,
bringing our cash position to over $1 billion before inclusion
of future expected payments of at least $400 million from prior
settlements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
