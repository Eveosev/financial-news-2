Royal KPN NV (KPN) , the Dutch phone company
partly owned by  Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil SAB (AMXL) , gained as much
as 6 percent after Sanford C. Bernstein raised its
recommendation as the Dutch business may perform better than
investors expected.  KPN traded 4.6 percent higher at 1.53 euros as of 10:13
a.m. in Amsterdam, valuing the company at 6.5 billion euros
($8.6 billion), and bringing the two-day gain to 9.7 percent,
the largest such advance since April 11. Bernstein raised KPN to
outperform from market-perform and increased the target price 12
percent to 1.85 euros.  “Our survey gives us some room for optimism regarding
results recovery in 2014 and reason to believe that some things
could go right,”  Robin Bienenstock , a London-based analyst at
Bernstein, said in the note published today. She raised her
estimates for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, now forecasting a 2.2 percent decline in 2014
after a 13 percent drop this year.  KPN raised about 3 billion euros through a share sale to
invest in operations and reduce debt. The company has scrapped
dividends planned for 2013 and 2014. The phone operator needs to
strengthen its balance sheet after spending 1.35 billion euros
on wireless spectrum to increase network speed for customers
using smartphones for surfing the Web, downloading music and
watching videos.  “Structural ills are now not only well-known but priced
in, and although the probability of a lot of good things
happening to this company is low, they could create a
theoretical increase in value up to 2.40 euros per share,”
Bienenstock said. A sale of the German business would be
possible if business gets worse, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
