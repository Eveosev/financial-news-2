Boeing Co. (BA)  overcharged the Pentagon’s
primary parts-buying agency $13.7 million in 1,469 parts orders
after government personnel failed to negotiate “fair and
reasonable prices,” according to the Pentagon’s inspector
general.  The inspector general recommended that the  Defense
Logistics Agency  “implement available options to recover from
Boeing the overpayment” and renegotiate for overpaid parts, it
said in a report  summary  posted today on its website. It didn’t
say which military systems the parts were for.  “Pricing problems occurred because DLA Aviation
contracting officers did not conduct a fair and reasonable price
analysis,” according to the audit summary. “If prices are not
corrected, DLA Aviation will continue to overpay on future sole-source spare parts procured from Boeing.”  Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher said in an e-mail that the
Chicago-based company had no immediate comment. The inspector
general’s summary said the defense agency provided comments that
were responsive to its criticism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
