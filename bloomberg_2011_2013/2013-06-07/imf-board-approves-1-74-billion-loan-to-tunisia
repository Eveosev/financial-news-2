Tunisia was approved for a $1.74
billion loan over two years from the International Monetary
Fund, the Washington-based lender said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “Tunisia has embarked on a moderate economic recovery
while facing a challenging international economic environment
and pursuing a political transition,” the IMF said in the
statement. “A fragile banking sector, pressing social demands,
widespread regional disparities, and high unemployment are key
challenges, together with widening external and fiscal
deficits.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
