Twilio Inc., a provider of voice and
texting services to mobile-application developers, raised $70
million from venture capitalists as it seeks new customers in
retail, transportation and hospitality.  The funding is being led by  Redpoint Ventures  and includes
Bessemer Venture Partners and Draper Fisher Jurvetson, San
Francisco-based Twilio said today. Redpoint’s Scott Raney will
join Twilio’s board, the company said.  Twilio, founded in 2008, is riding a boom in mobile
messaging, as companies such as car-hire app Uber Technologies
Inc. and  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  use its service to reach customers over
wireless devices. Twilio, which said it has expanded into more
than 40 countries and doubled sales in each of the past three
years, didn’t disclose revenue or other financials.  Most of Twilio’s 150 employees work in a new headquarters
in San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood. All staff
members are required to create their own messaging apps upon
joining.  The market for messaging services could be worth billions
of dollars, according to Jeff Lawson, Twilio’s co-founder and
chief executive officer.  “We helped developers and corporations realize they can
tap the power of the cloud for voice and messaging services,”
Lawson said in an e-mailed statement. “This represents a
multibillion-dollar market opportunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
