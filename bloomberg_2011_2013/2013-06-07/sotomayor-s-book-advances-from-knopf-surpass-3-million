U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor collected $1.9 million last year for her memoir,
bringing her total to more than $3 million, according to a
financial disclosure form released today.  Sotomayor received a $1 million advance in April 2012 and
another $925,000 in December from the publisher, Knopf Doubleday
Group. That’s on top of a $1.175 million advance she earned in
2010.  In the book, “My Beloved World,” the court’s first Latina
justice tells the story of her life until she became a federal
trial judge in 1992. The book, which describes her childhood in
a  New York  City housing project and her Puerto Rican roots, has
been on best-seller lists since its release in January. The book
has been published in English and Spanish.  Sotomayor’s disclosure form suggests she paid cash when she
bought a two-bedroom condominium in Washington’s U Street
Corridor for $660,000 a year ago. Although Sotomayor lists the
mortgage for her New York apartment as a liability -- she still
owes between $250,000 and $500,000 -- she didn’t list any
mortgage for her Washington home.  Sotomayor, 58, is one of two sitting justices to have
written their memoirs. Justice Clarence Thomas’s 2007 book
traced his life from his childhood in rural  Georgia  through his
1991 Supreme Court nomination and the sexual harassment
allegations that almost derailed his confirmation.  Outside Income  Supreme Court associate justices earn $213,900 a year. They
may supplement their salaries through teaching and book sales.  Chief Justice John Roberts, who makes $223,500 a year,
collected an additional $20,000 by teaching at New England
School of Law’s study-abroad program in Malta.  Justice Antonin Scalia earned $26,500 from five teaching
assignments, plus $63,992 in book royalties. Scalia’s most
recent book is “Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal
Texts.”  Justice Elena Kagan received $15,000 for teaching at
Harvard Law School. Thomas earned $10,000 by teaching a course
at George Washington University School of Law.  Justice Stephen Breyer received royalties of $30,891. His
latest book is “Active Liberty: Interpreting our Democratic
Constitution.”  Breyer’s disclosure form reveals that he sold his  Amgen
Inc. (AMGN)  stock, worth between $15,000 and $50,000, in August. The
sale let Breyer take part when the court  ruled  in February that
the biotechnology company had to defend against claims it misled
investors about the safety of two drugs for anemia.  Roberts sold his holdings in  Dell Inc. (DELL)  and  Intel Corp. (INTC)  In
each case the shares were worth between $50,000 and $100,000.  Justice Samuel Alito, who received an extension of time to
file, was the only justice whose annual disclosure form wasn’t
released.  To contact the reporter on this story:
