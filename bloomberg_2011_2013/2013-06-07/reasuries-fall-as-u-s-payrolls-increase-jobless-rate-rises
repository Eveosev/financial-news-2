Treasuries fell for a sixth
consecutive week as higher-than-forecast employment growth
supported speculation the  Federal Reserve  will taper its bond-buying program with economic growth exhibiting momentum.  Yields on benchmark  10-year notes  sustained their longest
streak of weekly increases in four years even with the Labor
Department’s report showing the  unemployment rate  rose to 7.6
percent in May. The Fed will trim its monthly purchases of
Treasuries and mortgages to $65 billion in October, a smaller
cut than previously forecast, from the current $85 billion,
economists in a Bloomberg survey projected before the report.  “The economy is showing that things are getting better,”
said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president of fixed-income
trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York. “I don’t think
the Fed is going to wait until the race is over. The market is
trying to figure out what will be a fair number.”  The 10-year note  yield  climbed 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 2.17 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield rose four
basis points on the week. The price of the 1.75 percent security
due in May 2023 slid 26/32, or $8.13 per $1,000 face amount, to
96 7/32.  Thirty-year (USGG30YR)  bond yields increased nine basis points to 3.33
percent. They touched 3.34 percent, the highest level since May
31. They rose six basis points on the week.  A measure of  volatility  in Treasuries climbed yesterday to
almost a one-year high.  Bets Reversed  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators reversed
bets and wagered that 10- and 30-year Treasuries prices will
increase, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. Speculative long positions, or bets on a rise, on 10-year
notes outnumbered short positions by 19,684 contracts on the
Chicago Board of Trade in the week ended June 4. Last week,
traders were net-short 35,505 contracts.  On 30-year bonds, longs outnumbered short positions by
2,369 contracts. Last week, traders were net-short 27,251
contracts.  Payrolls swelled by 175,000 jobs after a revised 149,000
increase in April that was smaller than first estimated. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a gain of
163,000. The  unemployment rate  rose from 7.5 percent, the lowest
since December 2008, as more people entered the  labor force .  The economy added an average of 179,000 positions a month
to nonfarm payrolls in 2011 and 2012, according to Labor
Department data.  “The number was right in line,” said  William Larkin , a
fixed-income portfolio manager who helps oversee $500 million at
Cabot Money Management Inc., from Salem,  Massachusetts . “The
market was expecting a restraining growth number.”  Volatility Climbs  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch MOVE index was at 81.53 today, after climbing to
84.75 yesterday, the highest since June 2012. It has averaged
62.5 in the past 12 months.  Trading volume handled by ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt  dropped 3.78 percent to
$463.3 billion, from $481.6 billion yesterday. Volume surged to
$662 billion on May 22, the highest level in data going back to
2004, according to ICAP. The average daily volume this year is
$306.84 billion.  Treasuries have lost 1.7 percent since the end of April,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, amid
speculation the Fed will slow the pace of its asset purchases.
The U.S. central bank, which next meets June 18-19, is buying
$45 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion of mortgage-backed
securities each month to hold down borrowing costs.  Sustained Improvement  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told Congress May 22 policy
makers could cut the pace of its purchases if they see signs of
sustained improvement in growth. He also said tightening policy
too soon would endanger the recovery.  The central bank will pare its purchases to $35 billion of
Treasuries and $30 billion of mortgage bonds at the Oct. 29-30
meeting of the  Federal Open Market Committee , according to the
median estimate in a survey of 59 economists this week. In a
similar survey before the Fed’s April 30-May 1 meeting,
economists expected the Fed to cut total purchases to $50
billion in the fourth quarter.  Gross Outlook  Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest bond fund, said
the Fed is unlikely to reduce its asset purchases after the
unemployment rate climbed from a four-year low and the Labor
Department report showed hourly earnings were little changed at
$23.89 in May from the previous month.  “I don’t think today’s report says anything about tapering
at all,” Gross, co-founder and co-chief investment officer of
Pacific Investment Management Co., said in a radio interview on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and  Mike McKee .
Bernanke “won’t taper. But I think ultimately in order to get a
more normal economy, the Fed has got to move  interest rates  up
to more normal levels.”  The Fed has held its benchmark  interest-rate  target for
overnight lending between banks in a range of zero to 0.25
percent since 2008 to support the economy. Bernanke has said
he’ll keep it at virtually zero until unemployment falls to 6.5
percent while inflation is projected at no more than 2.5
percent. The  consumer price index  increased 1.1 percent in April
from a year earlier, the Labor Department reported on May 16.  Treasuries due in a decade or more are at almost the
cheapest level since July 2011 relative to global peers with
comparable maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Yields on  U.S. debt  were 50 basis points higher
than those in an index of other sovereign debt yesterday. Yields
climbed to 60 basis points in the two trading days ending June
3, the cheapest in almost two years.  ‘Best House’  “The U.S. is the best house in the neighborhood, and a lot
of people are going to continue to buy U.S. obligations,” said
Richard Schlanger, who helps invest $20 billion in fixed-income
securities as vice president at Pioneer Investments in  Boston .  The Treasury 10-year yield will end the year at 2.19
percent, according to the median forecast of economists and
strategists in a Bloomberg News survey. That would be the
highest  year-end  yield since 2010, when it was 3.29 percent. The
yield was 1.76 percent at the end of last year and 1.88 percent
at the close of 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
