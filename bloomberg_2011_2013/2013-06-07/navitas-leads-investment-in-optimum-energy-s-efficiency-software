Navitas Capital  led a $12.2 million
venture capital investment in Optimum Energy LLC to fund
development of software that’s designed to reduce electricity
use in buildings.  Existing investor Columbia Pacific Advisors LLC also
participated, Jonathan Shaw, Optimum’s senior marketing manager,
said today by e-mail.  The investments will support development of the company’s
software that uses “predictive diagnostics” to manage in real-time heating and cooling systems in buildings and cut associated
energy costs by as much as half, Shaw said. Seattle-based
 Optimum  plans to sell its software to Fortune 500 companies and
large government organizations, he said.  U.S. commercial buildings  consumed  about 36 percent of the
country’s electricity last year, according to the U.S. Energy
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
