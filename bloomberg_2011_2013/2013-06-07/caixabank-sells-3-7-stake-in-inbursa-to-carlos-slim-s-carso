CaixaBank (CABK)  SA, Spain’s third-largest
bank, sold a 3.7 percent stake in Mexican lender Grupo
Financiero Inbursa to billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s Inmobiliaria
Carso.  CaixaBank sold the stake for 387 million euros ($512
million) and booked a gain of 33 million euros, the company said
in an e-mailed statement today. The  Barcelona-based lender  plans
to sell another 6.4 percent of Inbursa to institutional
investors, cutting its stake to as little as 9 percent.  Spanish banks are raising capital to bolster their balance
sheets before the  European Central Bank , set to take over

market saddled the banking system with about 180 billion euros
of soured assets.  Caixabank rose 0.8 percent to 2.72 euros in Madrid trading
