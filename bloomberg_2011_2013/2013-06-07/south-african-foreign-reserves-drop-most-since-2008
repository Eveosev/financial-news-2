 South Africaâ€™s foreign-currency
reserves fell the most in more than four years in May after the
government repaid a loan.  Gross reserves  fell 4.3 percent from the previous month to
$48.2 billion, the Pretoria-based central bank said on its
website today. Net reserves declined to $45.4 billion from $45.8
billion in April.  South Africa repaid a loan of 1.3 billion euros ($1.7
billion) last month, while a stronger dollar cut the value of
holdings of other currencies in reserves, the central bank said.  The bank has been building reserves to act as a buffer
against currency volatility. The rand slumped 11 percent against
the dollar in May, taking its decline in the first five months
of the year to 16 percent. The currency fell 0.2 percent to
9.883 per dollar as of 8:15 a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
