Pierre Mauroy, the former French
prime minister who pushed through major policy changes in the
early 1980s under Socialist President  Francois Mitterrand , has
died. He was 84.  The office of French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault
confirmed Mauroy’s death. Mauroy had been operated for  lung
cancer  a year ago and died of complications from the disease,
 Agence France-Presse  said.  “He served Mitterrand with great honor,” Jacques Attali,
an adviser to Mitterrand, said on i-Tele television. “He was
determined to prepare France for the 21st century.”  Mauroy had been the mayor of the northern city of Lille
since 1973 and was a major figure in the Socialist Party when
Mitterrand was elected in 1981.  He implemented Mitterrand’s electoral promises of cutting
the  retirement age  to 60 from 65, nationalizing banks and wide
swathes of industry and raising welfare payments and the minimum
wage. He also boosted  government spending  on research and on the
arts.  Mitterrand reversed some of those policies in 1983 after his
early policies led to higher inflation, budget deficits and a
run on the French franc.  Mauroy resigned as prime minister in 1984 after public
protests forced him to abandon a plan to cut funding to private
schools. Most of the nationalized companies were sold off under
subsequent governments.  Mauroy ran the French socialist party from 1988 to 1991 and
was mayor of Lille until 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
