Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC) , a Calgary-based
 oil company  that operates in Colombia, rose to the highest in
two months after drilling partner Platino Energy Corp. said it
was starting a well on a “significant” prospect.  Canacol 2.1 advanced percent to 5,280 pesos at 1:21 p.m. in
Bogota, the highest intraday price since April 12. It was the
biggest gainer on the benchmark Colcap index, which fell 0.2
percent.  Platino started its first exploration well on the  Coati
Block  in Colombia and expects to release drilling results in the
third quarter, the company said in a statement today. Canacol
said last month it agreed to acquire a 20 percent stake in the
block.  Coati, located near the border with  Ecuador , is “one of
the most significant conventional exploration targets in
Colombia this year,” Platino chief executive officer Tomas Villamil said in the statement. Last month, Villamil said Coati
is Platino’s largest potential prospect.  Calgary-based Platino’s Canadian-traded shares gained 6.3
percent to C$1.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
