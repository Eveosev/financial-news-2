Glencore Xstrata Plc failed to buy
 North Sea  Forties crude at a lower price than yesterday. The
company sold Russian Urals blend at a bigger discount than the
last trade in northwest Europe, the first transaction in more
than two weeks.  The North Sea Buzzard field restarted this morning after an
equipment glitch yesterday, said three people with knowledge of
the matter who asked not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Daily exports of Azeri Light crude from a port in  Turkey 
will decline by 1.2 percent in July from this month, a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Glencore didn’t manage to buy Forties for June 24 to June
29 at 10 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That compares with its purchase yesterday at
parity to the benchmark.  No bids or offers were made for Ekofisk and Oseberg today.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days was unchanged at 5 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $104.36 a barrel on the
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $103.65 in the previous session. The August contract was at
$104.14 at the same time today, a discount of 22 cents to July.  Buzzard was pumping at 120,000 to 130,000 barrels a day at
about 6 a.m. this morning, one of the people said. The field was
halted yesterday after an equipment failure. An earlier fault
caused output to be disrupted during the weekend of June 1-2.  ConocoPhillips (COP)  shut its Ekofisk fields in early June for
about one month of planned maintenance, Stig Kvendseth, a
Stavanger, Norway-based spokesman for the company said today in
an e-mailed statement.  “The Greater Ekofisk Area has scheduled shutdowns every
three years for maintenance,” he said. The Eldfisk field, which
flows into the Ekofisk stream, was halted late May for about 70
days, according to the company.  One shipment of 650,000 barrels of Flotta crude for June
26-28 loading will be exported, according to a revised loading
program obtained by  Bloomberg News . The original shipping
schedule for June showed no exports.  Mediterranean/Urals  Glencore sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals for June 26 to
June 30 loading to Total SA at 50 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the survey showed. That
compares with a discount of 40 cents for the last trade on May
22.  Glencore failed to sell 80,000 tons of Urals for June 17 to
June 21 loading at a discount of 85 cents a barrel to Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , 25 cents less than
its offer yesterday, according to the survey.  Urals in the Mediterranean fell by 12 cents to a discount
of 50 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was 15 cents a barrel
to the benchmark, versus a 12-cent discount yesterday.  Shipments of Azeri Light crude from Ceyhan will total 21.6
million barrels, or 696,774 barrels a day, in July, compared
with 705,000 barrels a day in June, according to a shipping
schedule.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend rose 3 cents to a premium
of $2.21 a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
