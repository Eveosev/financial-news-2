France  banned sending bank notes,
coins and precious metals in mail shipments, according to a
government decree.  Jewelery with a value of at least 100,000 euros ($132,040)
can only be mailed with a statement of value by registered mail
or with a declaration of deposit and delivery, according to the
May 21  decree , which was published on the governmentâ€™s legal
website May 23.  The value of objects included in registered mail shipments
must not exceed the level of insurance picked by the sender at
the time of deposit, according to the decree.  To contact the reporter on this story:
