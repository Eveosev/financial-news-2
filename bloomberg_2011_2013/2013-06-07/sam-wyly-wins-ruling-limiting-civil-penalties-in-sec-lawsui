Sam Wyly, the former  Michaels Stores
Inc. (MIK)  chairman sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for alleged insider trading and securities fraud, won
a ruling limiting the civil penalties the agency can seek.  U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan in an
order today agreed with Wyly that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in
February bars the SEC from seeking civil penalties more than
five years after the alleged violations.  A tolling agreement between the SEC and Wyly in 2006, which
stops the clock on the statute of limitations, will limit any
civil penalties to violations that occurred after Feb. 1, 2001,
according to the judge’s order. The SEC alleges that Wyly and
his late brother Charles made fraudulent and false filings as
early as 1992, according to the ruling.  In addition to civil penalties, the SEC seeks about $550
million in disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. The judge’s ruling
on civil penalties didn’t address the SEC’s disgorgement
request.  John Nester , an SEC spokesman. said in an e-mail that the
agency is reviewing the decision.  The SEC sued in 2010, after a six-year investigation, and
accused the brothers of using “an elaborate sham system of
trusts and subsidiary companies” in the  Isle of Man  and  Cayman
Islands  in a 13-year scheme to hide their ownership of stock in
four public companies on whose boards they sat.  The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Wyly, 10-cv-05760, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
