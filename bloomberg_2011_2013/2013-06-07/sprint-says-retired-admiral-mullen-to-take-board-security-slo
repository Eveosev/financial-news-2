  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  said retired
Admiral Mike Mullen will join the board as an independent
director following its proposed transaction with  SoftBank Corp. (9984) ,
becoming the designated member overseeing security matters.  Mullen will oversee Sprint’s compliance with an agreement
the company made with U.S. government agencies to win approval
for the transaction, the company said today in a statement.
He’ll also be the government’s main contact on security.  SoftBank, based in Tokyo, is seeking to show its $20.1
billion deal to take control of Sprint won’t compromise
government communications on the U.S. carrier’s network. The
company also agreed last month not to purchase  network equipment 
from Chinese manufacturers.  Mullen, 66, was the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of
Staff from 2007 to 2011, the highest rank in the nation’s armed
forces.  To contact the reporter on this story:
