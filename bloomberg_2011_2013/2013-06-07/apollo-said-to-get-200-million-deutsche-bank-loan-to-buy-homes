Deutsche Bank AG (DB)  arranged a $200
million credit facility for  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  to buy
U.S. single-family rental homes, according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  The loan will allow Apollo to buy, renovate and rent the
properties, said the person, who requested anonymity because the
deal hasnâ€™t yet been announced. Apollo, founded in 1990 as a
private-equity firm, manages $114 billion of assets and is an
investor in Haven Realty Capital LLC, an El Segundo, California-based manager of single-family homes.  The bank line is at least the third by Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank to money managers who are seeking to take
advantage of the recovering  housing market  following its worst
crash since the Great Depression. Private-equity firms have been
among the biggest buyers of foreclosed and distressed homes
across the U.S. to turn into rentals, helping to turn what has
historically been a mom-and-pop business into an institutional
asset class.  Deutsche Bank in March led a syndicate of lenders offering
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the largest U.S. owner of single-family
homes with about 26,000, an expansion of its credit line to $2.1
billion from $600 million to buy houses. It also arranged a $100
million loan for asset manager Five Ten Capital LLC the
following month.  Renee Calabro , a spokeswoman for the bank,
declined to comment on the Apollo credit line, as did Melissa Mandel Kvitko, a spokeswoman for New York-based Apollo at
public-relations firm Rubenstein Associates.  Haven managed about 1,000 houses in California, Nevada and
Illinois as of March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
