European stocks advanced as a report
showed U.S. employment increased more in May than forecast.  The Stoxx 600 climbed 0.3 percent to 292.44 at 1:33 p.m. in
London. The benchmark gauge is still heading for a weekly
decline of 2.9 percent amid growing speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will scale back monetary stimulus measures as soon as
September.  U.S. payrolls rose 175,000 last month after a revised
149,000 increase in April that was smaller than first estimated,
Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington . The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 163,000 gain. The
 unemployment rate  rose to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  in May suggested the central
bank could curtail its bond buying if the job market improves in
a “real and sustainable way.”  In  Germany , the Bundesbank cut its forecasts for growth in
Europe’s largest economy for this year and next. The Frankfurt-based central bank reduced its 2013 growth projection to 0.3
percent from the 0.4 percent predicted in December, and said the
economy would expand by 1.5 percent in 2014, compared with the
previous estimate of 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
