Lincoln National Corp. (LNC)  led a rally
among insurance companies as Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP
analysts said the firm may increase share buybacks and boosted
their  price target .  Lincoln  gained  3.2 percent to $35.74 at 10:34 a.m. in New
York, the most on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index. All
22 companies in the gauge advanced as equities rallied and bond
yields rose after an increase in U.S. payrolls.  The insurer will probably  repurchase  $450 million of shares
this year, after Chief Financial Officer Randy Freitag said the
company bought back $150 million in the second quarter,
according to Sandler O’Neill analysts led by Ed Shields. They
raised their 12-month price target on the Radnor, Pennsylvania-based company to $39 from $37.  “We believe that LNC will repurchase more shares than the
$400 million guidance” for 2013, the analysts wrote in a
research note today, using Lincoln’s ticker symbol.  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  gained 1 percent after Labor Department
figures showed U.S. employers added 175,000 workers in May. The
10-year Treasury yield rose 6 basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 2.14 percent.  Life insurers invest payments from clients in bonds and
other assets to generate profits and meet future obligations.
Interest rates near record lows have pressured results at the
companies.  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and  Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU) , the
largest U.S. life insurers, advanced at least 2 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
