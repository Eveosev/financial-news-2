Peru’s President  Ollanta Humala 
turned down a request from the family of jailed former leader
 Alberto Fujimori  to release him from jail.  Humala took the decision this morning after a government
commission found the 74-year-old Fujimori isn’t terminally ill,
said Justice Minister Daniel Figallo in a televised news
conference.  Fujimori was jailed in 2009 for human rights violations by
government-linked death squads committed during his 10-year rule
that ended in 2000. Fujimori’s family sought his release from
prison on humanitarian grounds, citing recurring tongue cancer,
depression and  weight loss .  “The request, the facts and the conditions don’t justify a
humanitarian pardon,” Figallo said. Fujimori “isn’t terminally
ill. Nor does he have a serious, incurable, degenerative
illness.”  Fujimori is credited with laying the foundations of the
Andean nation’s economic boom by ending hyperinflation, luring
foreign investment and defeating the Shining Path, a Maoist
insurgency. He received a 25-year jail sentence for ordering two
massacres of civilians.  Humala defeated the former president’s daughter Keiko
Fujimori in 2011 elections by 3 percentage points. Her Fuerza
Popular party holds the largest number of seats in Congress
after Humala’s Gana Peru party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
