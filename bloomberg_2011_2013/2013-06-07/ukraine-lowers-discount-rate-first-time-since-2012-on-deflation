Ukraine’s central bank cut its
benchmark rate for the first time in more than a year, reducing
it to the lowest since 2004 after the country recorded  deflation 
for a seventh month.  The  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy  in Kiev cut the  discount  rate
to 7 percent, effective June 10, from 7.5 percent yesterday,
according to a  statement  on its website today. That’s the first
change since March 2012.  Ukraine’s economy shrank 1.3 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier as demand waned for the country’s exports
such as steel. Consumer prices fell 0.4 percent in May on an
annual basis, the state statistics committee said yesterday.  “The rate cut will be positively accepted by the market
and will boost lending,” Governor Ihor Sorkin said in the
statement. “Together with other measures taken by the central
bank and the government, it will promote economic activity in
the country and will help the stability of the banking system.”  Neighboring Belarus yesterday cut its benchmark  interest
rate  to 23.5 percent in its fourth reduction this year and
 Serbia ’s central bank unexpectedly lowered its benchmark to 11
percent. Elsewhere in eastern  Europe , Poland and  Hungary  cut
rates to record lows in the past two weeks, while the Czech
central bank is considering currency sales with rates at
effectively zero.  -- Editors: Paul Abelsky, Leon Mangasarian  To contact the reporter on this story:
