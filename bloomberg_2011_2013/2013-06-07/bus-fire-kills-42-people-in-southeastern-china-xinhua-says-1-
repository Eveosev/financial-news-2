A bus burst into flames on an
elevated lane in southeastern  China ’s Fujian province yesterday,
killing at least 42 people and injuring at least 33, the
official Xinhua News Agency said, citing authorities.  The bus caught fire in Xiamen at about 6:30 p.m. local time
when it was 500 meters away from the the Jinshan bus stop,
Xinhua said, citing an unidentified city official. The cause of
the fire is under investigation, the news service reported.  Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang give
“instructions” on handling the fire, Xinhua reported. The
government has sent a work team lead by Minister of Public
Security Guo Shengkun to the scene, the news agency said.  On June 3, a fire at a poultry plant in the northeastern
province of Jilin killed 120 people. The nation’s deadliest
blaze in 13 years prompted Chinese President Xi Jinping to order
an investigation.  The Fujian Daily gave the death toll for the Xiamen fire at
48, without citing anyone.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
