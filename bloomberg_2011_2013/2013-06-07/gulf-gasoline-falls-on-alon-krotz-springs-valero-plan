U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline weakened
versus New York futures as  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  restarted a unit
at Krotz Springs,  Louisiana , and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  neared
completion of work at a  Texas  site.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, in the Gulf slid
1.75 cents to  16 cents  a gallon below futures at 12:44 p.m. on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Reformulated gasoline, or
RBOB, dropped 1.25 cents to a discount of  1 cent .  The differentials widened after Alon’s 83,000-barrel-a-day
Krotz Springs plan resumed production on a reformer unit that
had been shut for repairs since a fire in late April, according
to a company statement. The plant’s throughput for the second
quarter is projected to reach 60,000 barrels a day.  A shut hydrocracker at Valero’s Port Arthur, Texas,
refinery is expected to restart within the next week after
undergoing 30 days of maintenance that began May 9. Work
included catalyst changeouts on the 45,000-barrel-a-day unit,
according to  Bill Day , a company spokesman based in  San Antonio ,
who said maintenance continues today.  The return of such units may boost Gulf Coast utilization
rates and add to already  seasonally high  inventories of gasoline
in the region, known as PADD 3.  Stockpiles of motor fuel soared to  77 million barrels  in
the week ended May 31, the highest level for this time of year
in data going back to 1990, according to U.S. Energy Information
Administration data. Gulf refiners processed  8.28 million 
barrels a day of crude and other feedstock, or about 91 percent
of refinery capacity.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf, a rough measure of
refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , fell 59 cents to $20.97 a barrel. The same spread for
Light Louisiana Sweet oil dropped $1.19 to $11.37 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
