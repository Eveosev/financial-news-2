Italy’s government bonds rose,
pushing 10-year yields down the most in more than two months, as
data showing U.S. companies added more jobs than economists
forecast in May boosted demand for higher-yielding assets.  Spanish securities also gained as the U.S. Labor Department
said payrolls rose 175,000 last month after adding a revised
149,000 in April. German, Belgian, Dutch and Austrian bonds fell
as demand for safer assets waned. Euro-area government bonds
slid yesterday, pushing Spanish and Italian 10-year yields up
the most in six weeks, after European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi said the economy will return to growth by year-end,
reducing the need for additional stimulus.  “There is a relief rally in Italy and Spain,” said
Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV
in Amsterdam. “The market overreacted to the ECB meeting.
Today’s payroll data shows an improvement in job market which
points to better economic conditions in U.S. Hence, the data is
supportive for risky assets.”  Italian 10-year yields fell 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, to 4.19 percent at 4:51 p.m.  London  time, the
biggest decline since April 5. The 4.5 percent security due in
May 2023 climbed 1.4, or 14 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,322) face
amount, to 102.84. Yields rose 23 basis points yesterday, the
most since Feb. 26.  The rate on similar-maturity Spanish bonds fell 15 basis
points to 4.54 percent, while  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose
three basis points to 1.55 percent after earlier sliding to as
low as 1.48 percent, the least since May 31.  ‘Still Problems’  Loomis Sayles & Co. sold all its Spanish bonds while
retaining some Italian securities, Boston-based money manager
Kenneth Buntrock said today.  “We’ve been opportunistic about buying Italian and Spanish
bonds,” Buntrock said at a media briefing in London. “There
are still problems in the region. We are concerned about
growth.”  Belgium ’s 10-year yield climbed four basis points to 2.34
percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Austrian debt
increased three basis points to 1.95 percent. Dutch 10-year
yields added two basis points to 1.89 percent.  The ECB cut its main interest rate by a quarter of a
percentage point at its May meeting, when policy makers also
considered taking the unprecedented step of charging banks to
park funds with it overnight as a means of stoking lending to
boost the region’s economy.  Draghi yesterday said the ECB had kept additional stimulus
measures, including negative deposit rates, “on the shelf.” He
was speaking after policy makers left the  refinancing rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent.  Portuguese 10-year bonds declined, pushing the yield on the
securities up seven basis points to 6.14 percent. It earlier
climbed 24 basis points to 6.31 percent, the highest since April
15.  Italian bonds handed investors a return of 2.7 percent this
year through yesterday, according to the Bloomberg Italy
Sovereign Bond  Index. (BITA)  Spanish securities gained 5.3 percent,
while German bonds lost 0.8 percent, separate indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
