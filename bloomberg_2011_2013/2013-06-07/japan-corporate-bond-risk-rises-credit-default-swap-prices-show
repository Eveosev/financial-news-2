The cost of insuring corporate bonds
against non-payment in  Japan  climbed, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 0.5 basis point to 99
basis points as of 9:32 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The gauge is poised to end the week up 2.5 basis points,
after jumping 13 last month, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 0.5 basis point
to 121.5 basis points as of 9:56 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The benchmark, which has ranged from 96.1
basis points to 127.5 basis points this year, is set for its
first decline in three days, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 127 basis points
as of 8:39 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
prices show. The measure, which rose yesterday to its highest
since Nov. 16, is on course for its fourth straight weekly
increase, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of
creditworthiness, while a drop suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
