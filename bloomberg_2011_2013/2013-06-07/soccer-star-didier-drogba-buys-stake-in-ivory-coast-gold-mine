Didier Drogba , an Ivorian footballer
and former striker for London’s Chelsea, bought a 5 percent
stake in the Ity gold mine in Ivory Coast as part of a sale of
state assets to a company led by Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris , a government official said.  Drogba, who won the European  Champions League  with Chelsea
in 2012 and currently plays for Turkey’s Galatasaray, made the
investment through a company called Didier Drogba Group, Bruno Kone, a government spokesman, said by phone today from Abidjan,
the commercial capital. Drogba, 35, has served as the captain of
Ivory Coast’s national soccer team, known as the elephants  Ivory Coast sold part of its holding in the mine to a group
including Canadian miner La Mancha Resources Inc., Drogba’s
company and other private investors, Kone said. Sawiris is the
chairman of Montreal-based La Mancha.  La Mancha will now control 55 percent of the mine, an
increase from the 45.9 percent it previously held, Kone said.
 Ivory Coast  will 35 percent while private investors hold 10
percent.  Ity, which is in the west of Ivory Coast, has been open
