Azerbaijan’s ruling party nominated
President  Ilham Aliyev  for a third term in office, pitting him
against the largest-ever alliance of opposition parties.  YAP, as the governing party is known, also re-elected
Aliyev as its chairman and his wife Mehriban as a deputy, at a
congress in the Azeri capital of Baku today, according to a
 statement  on the president’s website.  Aliyev, who took over from his father after a disputed
election 10 years ago in the first dynastic succession in the
former Soviet Union, is looking to prolong his family’s four-decade-long hold on power. The Caspian Sea nation, where  BP Plc (BP/) 
and partners have invested more than $40 billion in energy
projects since 1994, is the largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union  after Russia and  Kazakhstan .  The country’s main opposition parties plan to field a
single candidate to challenge Aliyev in elections slated for
October. Groups including Musavat, or Equality, People’s Front,
Open Society, the Forum of Intellectuals and the El (People)
movement said today they were united behind the National Council
of Democratic Forces.  The goal of the alliance, led by Oscar-winning playwright
Rustam Ibrahimbayov, is to win the election and ensure a
peaceful transition to democracy, according to a statement
distributed to reporters in Baku.  To contact the reporter on this story:
