General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Opel brand will
stop making its Astra hatchback in Ruesselsheim,  Germany , in
2015 to make space for the Zafira minivan now made at the Bochum
site scheduled to close by the end of next year.  The company’s plant in Gliwice,  Poland , will increase Astra
production to make up for the lost volume, Ulrich Weber, a
spokesman for the company, said by phone today.  GM is reducing European production in an effort to stem
losses in the region that have totaled more than $18 billion
since 1999. The Detroit-based manufacturer said it would close
the Bochum factory after workers rejected an offer of job
security until 2016 in exchange for wage cuts.  “It’s a normal transition from one model to the other and
a process that will evolve step by step,” Weber said.  Ruesselsheim will stop producing the Astra before the
second half of 2015, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported today.
Weber didn’t comment on the exact timing.  About 50,000 five-door Astra models were manufactured in
Ruesselsheim last year, comparable to the amount of Zafira vans
made in Bochum, Weber said. The Astra competes with  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) ’s best-selling Golf model.  Ellesmere Port  The next version of the Astra will be built in Gliwice and
Ellesmere Port,  England , from 2015. Workers at the British
plant, operated by the Vauxhall brand, accepted wage cuts as
part of labor deal that will run into the early 2020s.  The site employs 2,122 people producing three types of
Astra, and has an annual capacity of 187,000 vehicles, according
to the  company’s website . The next-generation Astra will add 700
jobs at Ellesmere Port and guarantees an output of at least
160,000 cars a year, the company said.  Combined Opel and Vauxhall new car registrations in Europe
declined 5.2 percent to 279,409 vehicles in the four months
through April, compared with a market fall of 7 percent,
according to the  ACEA industry group . The Brussels-based
organization will publish May figures next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
