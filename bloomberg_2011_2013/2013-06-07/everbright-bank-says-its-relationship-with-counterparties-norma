China Everbright Bank Co. (601818)  said its
relationships with all trading counterparties are normal after
Market News International reported that it failed to repay an
interbank loan from  Industrial Bank Co. (601166)  on time yesterday.  The Beijing-based lender said in an e-mailed statement that
its relationship with Industrial Bank is good and that “all
liquidity indicators for Everbright Bank are good.”  The 6 billion yuan ($978 million) transaction was between
the local branches of the banks and Everbright Bank has already
paid a fine, Market News reported, citing three unidentified
people. Lu Hongfei, an investor relations officer at Industrial
Bank, decline to comment.  The rate lenders charge one another on overnight loans
jumped the most in almost two years today as shrinking capital
inflows led to a cash squeeze before a three-day holiday.  Shares of Industrial Bank, part-owned by a unit of HSBC
Holdings Plc, fell 1.4 percent to 17.10  yuan  at the 11:30 a.m.
break in Shanghai. Everbright Bank declined 0.7 percent to 2.98
yuan. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.8 percent as
money-market rates jumped. Both the one-day repurchase rate and
the one-month Shanghai interbank offered rate climbed to 16-month highs today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
