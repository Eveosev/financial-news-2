Gasoline futures rose as equities
advanced after a Labor Department report that the U.S. added
more jobs than forecast last month. Crack spreads narrowed.  Futures extended a weekly gain as the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rallied as much as 1 percent after a report showing a jobs
gain of 175,000 in May was balanced by an uptick in the jobless
rate, indicating the  Federal Reserve  may not see enough
improvement in the labor market to warrant reducing its economic
stimulus efforts.  “On balance, the report has been viewed as positive, but
not strong enough for the Fed to change its action,” said
Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd.,
a research company in  London .  Gasoline for July delivery rose 1.82 cents, or 0.6 percent,
