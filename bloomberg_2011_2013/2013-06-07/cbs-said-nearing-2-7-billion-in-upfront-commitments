CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s broadcast network has
almost completed negotiations for prime-time advertising
commitments totaling about $2.7 billion for the coming TV
season, said a person with knowledge of the situation.  The network’s ad rates are 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent
higher than a year earlier, said the person, who requested
anonymity because the talks are private. CBS is targeting
advance commitments for 70 percent to 80 percent of its ad
inventory in the TV season that begins in September, the person
said.  Dana McClintock, spokesman for New York-based CBS, declined
to comment.  The New York Times reported on the status of CBS
negotiations earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
