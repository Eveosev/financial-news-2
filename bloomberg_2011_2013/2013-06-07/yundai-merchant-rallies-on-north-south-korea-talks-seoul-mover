Hyundai Merchant Marine Co. (011200)  surged by
the daily limit in Seoul trading, leading gains among companies
that have businesses in  North Korea , after South Korea agreed to
hold government-level talks with the communist regime.  Hyundai Merchant, the biggest shareholder of Hyundai Asan
Corp., which manages a resort in Mount Geumgang in North Korea,
rallied 15 percent at 11:46 a.m. today, the most since Nov. 30,
2010. The stock is the best performer in the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index. Romanson Co. and  Shinwon Corp. (009270) , two South Korean
companies that operate plants in the Gaesong industrial complex,
jumped at least 14 percent.  South and North Korea yesterday agreed to hold negotiations
on reopening a jointly run industrial park in Gaesong, in what
will be their first government-level talks since the complex was
shut in April, marking the latest sign of easing tensions after
months of hostility.  “Investors believe that  South Korea  has a bigger stake in
the upcoming talks compared to ones held in the past,” Park Sung Hyun, an analyst at Hanwha Securities, said in Seoul. “The
talks were also proposed at a time when the relationship between
North Korea and China seems to be improving, giving a boost to
investor sentiment.”  The North also proposed discussing re-opening North Korea’s
Mount Geumgang luxury resort, which was closed in 2008 after its
soldiers killed a South Korean guest.  The  Kospi index  fell 1.5 percent, poised for its lowest
close since April 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
