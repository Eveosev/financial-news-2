Greece’s  economy contracted  for an
19th straight quarter in the first three months of this year as
consumption and investment declined.  Gross domestic product fell a revised 5.6 percent from a
year earlier, compared with a 5.7 percent drop in the fourth
quarter, according to an e-mailed statement from the Athens-based Hellenic Statistical Authority. The drop is more than a
May 15 initial estimate of 5.3 percent.  GDP declined 6.4 percent in 2012 and the International
Monetary Fund said in a report this week it will contract 4.2
percent this year before output expands in 2014. That contrasts
with the view of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, which forecasts a seventh year of recession for
 Greece  in 2014, with output shrinking 1.2 percent.  Gross fixed capital formation dropped 11.4 percent from a
year earlier, while final consumption expenditure was down 8.3
percent. Greece’s external trade deficit shrank 22.9 percent in
the first quarter as imports dropped 7.8 percent.  The first-quarter contraction, which is based on available
non-seasonally adjusted data, is the smallest annual decline
since the third quarter of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
