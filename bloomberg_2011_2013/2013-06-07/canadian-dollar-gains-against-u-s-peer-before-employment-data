The Canadian dollar gained versus its
U.S. counterpart before data forecast to show that  Canada  added
jobs in May for a second month.  Payrolls (CANLNETJ)  grew by 15,000 after a 12,500 increase the
previous month, according to the median of 25 forecasts in a
survey by Bloomberg. Employment in the U.S. grew by 163,000
workers after increasing by 165,000 in April, according to
another survey. The Canadian currency advanced the most in
almost a year yesterday as Bank of Canada Governor Stephen
Poloz, in his first public comments, reiterated his
predecessor’s view that rates will rise as the economy grows.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, rose 0.3 percent to
C$1.0235 per  U.S. dollar  at 8:14 a.m. in Toronto after touching
C$1.0234. One loonie buys 97.70 U.S. cents.  Crude-oil futures rose 0.5 percent to $95.22 a barrel in
 New York  and the Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index  of 24 commodities
gained 0.4 percent.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year government bond yields rose,
with yields falling two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 2.02 percent. The 1.5 percent security maturing in June 2023
traded at C$95.34.  To contact the reporter on this story:
