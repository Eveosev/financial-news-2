Cinven Partners LLP, a London-based
private equity firm, said it will reap seven times its
investment in U.K. annuity provider Partnership Assurance Group
Plc’s initial public offering.  The stock sale will give Partnership a market value of 1.54
billion pounds ($2.4 billion), making it eligible for inclusion
in the FTSE 250 Index, the company said in a statement today.
Cinven sold about 300 million pounds of shares in the IPO and
will keep a 52 percent stake valued at 800 million pounds.  Cinven bought Partnership for 158 million pounds in August
2008 from London-based Phoenix Equity Partners, financing the
investment entirely with equity from its fund. It’s taking the
insurer public after motor insurer Esure Group Plc raised 604
million pounds in an IPO in March and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc raised about 1.3 billion pounds by selling stakes in
Direct Line Group Plc, Britain’s biggest home and motor insurer.  “Partnership has been a strong investment for Cinven,”
Peter Catterall, a partner at Cinven, said in an e-mailed
statement. “Cinven will remain a significant shareholder in
Partnership in order to continue participating in its future
growth.”  Annuities combine elements of investment and insurance
products by offering guaranteed annual payouts to retirees. The
company’s operating profit rose 42 percent to 112 million pounds
in 2012.  Partnership Assurance sold 32.5 million new shares for 385
pence each in the offering to raise about 125 million pounds to
pay down debt. The insurer’s owners sold 94 million shares, and
Cinven may sell a further 19 million shares through the
overallotment option.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Bank of America  Corp. managed the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
