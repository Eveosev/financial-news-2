Sasol Ltd. (SOL) , the worldâ€™s biggest coal-to-fuel producer, said its Sasol New Energy unit saved 4.5
million rand ($452,000) in water costs by repairing leaking
pipes in residential areas near its Sasolburg industrial
complex.  The unit of the Johannesburg-based company repaired the
plumbing in 50,000 houses in Evaton and Sebokeng, it said in a
statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
