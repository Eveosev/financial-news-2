UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
has been placed under formal investigation by Paris prosecutors
as  France  steps up efforts to combat  tax evasion .  Judges Guillaume Daieff and Serge Tournaire are probing the
Swiss bank for illicit solicitation of clients, said Agnes
Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutors’
office. The action comes a week after UBS’s French unit was put
under formal investigation for complicity in illicit marketing.  The prosecutors are widening an inquiry over client
practices at UBS’s French business after putting three
individuals under formal investigation in 2012. French tax
investigators last year searched the bank’s offices in cities
including Strasbourg, Lyon and Paris.  “This is not a new issue,” Zurich-based UBS said in an e-mailed statement today. “UBS does not tolerate any activities
intended to help its clients circumvent their tax obligations.”  The Swiss bank was also given the status of material
witness in covering up  tax fraud  and illicit marketing,
Thibault-Lecuivre said, a designation which allows it have a
lawyer present during questioning.  The bank “will continue working with the authorities in
France within the applicable legal framework to arrive at a
resolution to this matter,” UBS said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
