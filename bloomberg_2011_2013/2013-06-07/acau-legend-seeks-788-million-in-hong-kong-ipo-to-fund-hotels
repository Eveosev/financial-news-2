Macau Legend Development Ltd ., the
casino operator backed by former Macau lawmaker David Chow, is
seeking as much as $788 million in an initial public offering to
finance new hotels in the world’s biggest gaming hub.  The company is offering 2.05 billion shares in  Hong Kong  at
HK$2.30 (30 cents) to HK$2.98 apiece, according to a term sheet
obtained by  Bloomberg News . New stock accounts for about 86
percent of the sale, the terms show.  Macau Legend, which operates casino venues under  SJM
Holdings Ltd. (880) , is starting the biggest gaming IPO in Hong Kong
since  MGM China Holdings Ltd. (2282) ’s $1.6 billion offering in May
2011. The company doesn’t have a casino license of its own,
according to a  filing  to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  Dynam Hong Kong Co. is investing $35 million in the IPO as
a cornerstone investor, the terms show. CLSA Ltd., Citic
Securities Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG are among banks
managing the sale, according to the terms.  Macau Legend plans to use about 37 percent of the IPO
proceeds to finance construction of the Prague Harbor View
Hotel. Another 30 percent will be used for the Palace Hotel, the
terms show. Macau Legend shares will start trading on Jun 27,
according to the terms.  Key assets of the company include the Landmark Macau hotel,
the  Pharaoh’s Palace  casino and the Macau Fisherman’s Wharf
complex, today’s exchange filing shows.  SJM is one of just six operators in Macau that have
government permission to run their own casinos. It operates some
casinos in partnership with companies that don’t have their own
licenses.  Chow served as a legislator in Macau from 2005 to 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
