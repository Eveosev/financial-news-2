Copper rose for the first time in
three days amid growing concerns that a shutdown of the world’s
second-biggest mine will curb supplies and a weakening dollar
may boost the appeal of metals as an alternative investment.  Copper for delivery in three months gained as much as 0.6
percent to $7,376 a ton on the London Metal Exchange and was at
$7,351.50 at 11:22 a.m. in  Seoul . Futures for delivery in July
gained 0.2 percent to $3.3265 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc.’s operations at the
Grasberg mine in  Indonesia  will stay shut until an independent
probe concludes, a government official said last week. The
government said the investigation may take as long as three
months. The Dollar Index, a gauge to measure the greenback’s
value against six major currencies, yesterday slipped by the
most since March 2009.  “Concerns about curbed supply from the Grasberg mine
remain at a time when we see some signs of recovering demand in
 China ,” Will Yun, a commodities analyst at Hyundai Futures
Corp., said by phone from Seoul today. “Copper premiums in
China are rising, meaning demand there is solid.”  A tunnel collapse at Grasberg on May 14 killed 28 people
and another worker died June 1 in a separate incident. Closing
the mine for three months would remove 140,000 tons of supply,
Macquarie Group Ltd. estimates.  Copper buyers in  Shanghai  pay $135 a ton more than LME
futures, up from $55 last year, Metal Bulletin data show. Copper
for delivery in October declined 0.3 percent to 52,730  yuan 
($8,599) per ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  On the LME, zinc and aluminum rose, while lead was little
changed. Nickel fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
