Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  traded near the lowest level in nine months as the
price of  iron ore  fell and investors continued to reduce
positions in the last trading day before a holiday.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.6 percent to 3,402 yuan ($555) a
metric ton, the lowest level for a most-active contract since
Sept. 7, and was at 3,417 yuan at 10:53 a.m. Futures are little
changed this week after falling for the past three weeks.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port in  China 
fell 2.3 percent to $113.90 a dry ton yesterday, according to
the Steel Index Ltd. The steelmaking ingredient fell to $110.40
a dry ton on May 31, the lowest since October. Investors trimmed
open interest on the most-actively traded contract for the past
four days, bourse data showed. Financial markets in China will
be closed for holiday between June 10 and June 12.  “The market continues to see bearish signs such as high
output and low raw-material prices,” Wang Yongliang, an analyst
at Beijing CIFCO Futures Co., said by phone from Tianjin today.
“Most investors will wait to see the situation after the
holiday before committing into their position.”  The  average spot price  for rebar fell 0.2 percent to 3,439
 yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
