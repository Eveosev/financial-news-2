Spanish  industrial output  declined
for a 20th month in April, contracting less than economists
forecast, as the euro area’s fourth-largest economy remains
mired in a recession the government predicts will end this year.  Production at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for
the number of working days fell 1.8 percent from a year earlier,
after declining a revised 0.8 percent in March, the National
Statistics Institute in Madrid said in an e-mailed statement
today. That compares with economists’ forecast of a 2.6 percent
decline, according to six estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey .  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is counting on exports to end
a six-year  slump  after changing labor rules to help companies
cut payroll costs. Gross domestic product contracted for a
seventh quarter in the first three months of the year as the
toughest austerity measures in the nation’s democratic history
and a 27 percent unemployment rate sap domestic demand.  Still, foreign sales reached a record high last year, and
the country posted its first  trade surplus  in more than four
decades in March. Companies such as swimming-pool supplier
 Fluidra SA (FDR)  have succeeded in boosting sales close to pre-crisis
levels by finding foreign buyers to offset slumping demand in
Spain.  The statistics office had initially reported a 0.6 percent
contraction in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
