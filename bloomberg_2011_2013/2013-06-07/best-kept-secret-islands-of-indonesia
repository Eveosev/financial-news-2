I went in search of dragons and found sapphire-blue starfish instead. It wasn't just a few, mind you, but a constellation nesting in a translucent bay within Indonesia's Komodo National Park. There's an obvious metaphor or two in that—the futility of expectations, the power of beauty over the beast—but I'm easily distracted, and at the time, while snorkeling just a few strokes off tiny Kanawa island, I'd become too preoccupied by the parade of neon fish gliding past my mask to give those frightful dragons (overfed lizards, really) any thought at all. In between swims, I'd sit under the bamboo roof of Kanawa's only restaurant, facing an empty beach of sparkling golden sands, play chess on a battered wooden board with one of the local guides, and seriously consider not writing about this island. Why not keep it to myself a little while longer. By that point in the trip, having already hop-scotched around six Indonesian islands, I was feeling quite pleased with myself. Years earlier, I had fallen hard for Bali but later discovered I wasn't the only woman in its life. I remember reading, with a sinking heart, that Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir Eat, Pray, Lovedoubled the number of visitors to the island, and that was before Julia Roberts arrived on the scene. Granted, even Hollywood couldn't spoil a place as enchanting as Bali, but still, I was ready to move on. And I knew just the person to help. As luck would have it, my brother's wife, Sumena, is both Indonesian (born in Sumatra) and an ardent traveler. "You do know," she pointed out, in her eminently sensible way, "that Indonesia has thousands of other islands—thousands—that hardly anyone visits. Or at least hardly any Americans." It took some time—years, in fact—before Sumena finally agreed to travel with me to the other Indonesia. Given that the Indonesian archipelago consists of more than four hundred volcanoes, many of them still twitchy, its messy topography is easily explained. The exact number of islands ebbs and flows with each tectonic rumbling, but these days the country's tourism office counts 17,508, all shapes and sizes, spattered around the equator. Only 6,000 are inhabited. From east to west, the island chain stretches across an area as wide as the continental United States. More from  Condé Nast Traveler : Indonesia does not lack variety. Don't take my word for it: The nineteenth-century British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, Darwin's more modest peer, rhapsodized about its astonishing biodiversity in his seminal work The Malay Archipelago. Wallace wrote that the wildlife on Bali differs as much from that of the neighboring island of Lombok, a mere fifteen miles away, as America's animals differ from Europe's. The contrast between the critters on Java (the most populous island) or Borneo (the wildest) and Sulawesi (the most mountainous) is still more striking, he noted. Orangutans, man's smartest relative, live on Sumatra (the largest island) and Borneo—and nowhere else in the world. Likewise, Komodo dragons are found only on a few small islands in the southeast. On Sulawesi alone are a bunch of endemic animals so quirky that they warrant their own Pixar film, starring, say, the feisty dwarf buffalo, the timid tailless monkey, and the nightlife-loving civet. But Indonesia's diversity is hardly limited to wildlife. Each of the country's roughly three hundred ethnic groups has its own language, customs, and food. Though Islam is the dominant religion (Indonesia has the world's largest Muslim population), the Balinese are mostly Hindu. Other islands have a majority Christian population, courtesy of the Portuguese spice traders and the Dutch missionaries, while Buddhism is widely practiced among the seven-million-strong Chinese community (which includes my sister-in-law's family). Animism, with its high-maintenance spirit gods, is alive and well in the rural areas, though some of its more notorious practices—headhunting, cannibalism—have gone out of fashion. Violent ethnic conflicts flare up every so often, and the country grapples with its own homegrown terrorist groups, which carried out devastating bombings in Bali in 2002 and 2005 and in Jakarta in 2003 and 2009. But Indonesia's complex geography and long history as a cultural crossroads, not to mention the government's vigorous counter-terrorism efforts, have mostly helped to keep the peace. Sumatra Over dinner in northern Sumatra one night, my new friend Imam isn't interested in discussing his country's cultural diversity, nor my country's. "Have you seen Toy Story 2? What about A Bug's Life?" He interrogates me tenaciously, as only a ten-year-old could. We are in his family's modest, cheerfully decorated home in the town of Bukit Lawang, the gateway to Gunung Leuser (Mount Leuser) National Park, where I have spent the morning stalking orangutans. Imam's father, Masno, is the chef at the Bukit Lawang Ecolodge, a colony of tidy bungalows and carefully tended gardens just outside the park. He and his wife also run their own place, Masno Café and Cake, out of their home. The restaurant was closed that night, but Masno has invited me to join his family for dinner, preceded by a lesson in Indonesian home cooking. I sit with him, his bubbly wife, Misnawati, and Imam on a mat in their living room, weighing peanuts and palm sugar on a small scale and measuring the rest of the ingredients for the gado-gado: star anise, tamarind, chili, ginger, garlic—all collected from the backyard garden. Aceh province, where police raided a jihadist training camp last year and where some villages have recently adopted sharia law, is just a mountain range away. But here in this Muslim home, where Misnawati lowers her voice and wrinkles her nose when she frets about Sumatran-born terrorists, where Imam's DVD collection rivals my niece's and nephew's in Los Angeles, and where Masno vacuum-seals the gado-gado for me to take home to New York, it might as well be in a different galaxy. I am already reaping the rewards of being one of the few foreigners in a place that is genuinely happy to see them and—rather poignantly, I think—eager to welcome many more. Admittedly, Gunung Leuser is one of the most popular tourist attractions on Sumatra, and giant tour buses do occasionally barrel down the main roads. But considering that Sumatra (twice the size of Great Britain) welcomes about 1.6 million foreign visitors a year while Bali, about the size of Delaware, gets more than two million, you can see how Bukit Lawang might feel somewhat lonely. Sumena has opted to meet me on the next leg of the trip, so I travel on my own to Bukit Lawang—but never stay that way for long. I arrive on a Sunday afternoon, just as the local families are settling into picnics on the rocky banks of the Bohorok River, which fronts my hotel. Several of the chattering, head-scarved women invite me to join them. The orangutans I've come to see are, if not quite as hospitable, at least obliging. Within the first ten minutes of my four-hour jungle trek, a mother and her gangly baby make a brief cameo, using their astonishingly long arms (twice as long as their legs) to leap to the tree just ahead of me, then rest for a bit while munching on termites, digging them out of their mud-built nests with sticks. I can barely make out Baby since she's farther up the tree and well hidden by the dense foliage. But Big Momma is clearly visible, and she's watching me just as intently as I'm watching her—only she's much less pleased about the encounter. Her patchy red hair frames an oblong face, wide-eyed with wariness, while her sinewy hundred-pound (at least) frame looks ready to pounce if need be. When she's finished with her snack, she hurls the empty termite nest a few inches from my feet. I don't blame her for being pissed. Man has not been kind to orangutans. The population has been decimated by decades of poaching and rapacious deforestation. Sumatran orangutans are critically endangered (their Bornean cousins are merely endangered), with fewer than seven thousand left in the wild. The primary culprit these days is the palm oil plantations that blanket north Sumatra and much of Borneo, leaving fewer and fewer suitable stomping grounds for the red ape. As I carefully negotiate my way around the steep, narrow, rain-soaked trails on Gunung Leuser, my hiking guide tells me that it's the formidable terrain which keeps the illegal loggers and the palm oil corporations from hacking away at the park, but it's hardly big enough to accommodate the entire species. Having stared, if only for a few minutes, at that deeply expressive face and those amazingly humanlike features—orangutans share ninety-seven percent of our DNA—I find it unthinkable that the species could disappear from the wild within the next twenty years, as biologists warn. Borneo Indonesia shares custody of Borneo, the world's third-largest island, with Brunei and Malaysia, but Indonesia claims the southern two-thirds of the pie and calls it Kalimantan. Sumena meets me at the airport in Jakarta just as we're about to board the two-hour flight to Balikpapan, East Kalimantan's second-largest city. The realization that there are any cities at all on Borneo is a big disappointment. More crushing still is news of a Starbucks. The Borneo of my imagination, fueled in large part by Eric Hansen's colorful 1988 memoir, Stranger in the Forest, was a Kipling-esque wilderness peopled by tattooed warriors and trance-dancing shamans. Instead, we're met at the gate by a middle-aged man in khakis and a collared shirt, our guide Petrus, and led to an SUV in the parking lot. The sad truth is that to a great degree, one of the world's wildest and oldest places has been tamed and modernized; its abundant natural resources—gold, timber, oil, and coal—ruthlessly exploited, its cities filled with spiffy shopping malls catering to industry executives. But Hansen's Borneo does still exist. Much of Kalimantan remains covered in an ancient forest that is home to the Dayak tribes, who hunt wild pigs with poisoned spears and bamboo blowpipes. Hansen penetrated that mysterious world by spending ten months walking 2,400 miles across the island. We take a shortcut. By nightfall, Sumena and I are sipping tea on the upper deck of a wooden houseboat, handcrafted and painted eggshell blue, steaming down the Mahakam River. Borneo is stitched together by four mighty rivers, including the 610-mile Mahakam and untold tributaries, and many villages are accessible only by boat. The Mahakam, I'm told, is the most touristed of the waterways, but at least for the first part of our journey, it has all the scenic beauty of a Costco parking lot, and there's not another foreigner in sight. The river is wide and flat and a gloomy greenish-brown, with massive barges carrying mountains of coal occasionally chugging past, temporarily filling the air with an acrid stench. Our private houseboat is tidy but spartan. We sleep on mats on the upper deck and take bucket showers in a plywood bathroom barely bigger than the toilet. That first night, we're forced to yell at each other to be heard above the deafening rumble of the engine. The next morning, we climb off the houseboat and into a motorized canoe. We glide past riverside villages lined with sawmills, general stores, and stilted, tin-roofed homes—some the same rickety affairs found throughout Southeast Asia, others freshly painted lilac, mint green, or butter yellow, their windows framed in lace curtains, hulking satellite dishes precariously rigged out front. The best-kept of all the buildings is the village mosque, often sharing the same cheery color palette as its neighbors and topped with a silver dome that reflects the sepia river water. (So popular are these silver domes that they're often sold in assorted sizes along the road.) Before long, the villages fall behind us and we're motoring through a slate-gray lake, nothing in sight but water buffalo and their posses of egrets. Beyond the lake, we curve into a narrow waterway and begin drifting through the very jungle I have in my mind's eye. Both banks are thick with ironwood trees, their gnarled trunks casting long shadows across the water's surface. Monkeys screech and lope along the shore. Metallic-blue kingfishers and yellow butterflies the size of my fist dip in and out of the tableau. Occasionally a fallen log blocks our passage ("Illegal loggers," growls Petrus), and the boatman uses an ax to muscle our way through. Our destination is the village of Mancong, home to members of the Dayak Benuaq, who once collected enemies' heads as others might collect rare works of art—for the prestige. (Then again, the heads were also meant to ward off evil spirits, so who's to say which is the more laudable pursuit.) But that was a century ago. Today's Dayak Benuaq are more interested in cultivating rice and courting tourists. The six-hundred-person village has a beautifully carved longhouse, which is used for weddings and funerals, as the elementary school, and to stage weekly ceremonial dances for tour groups. Ordinarily, I try to keep miles away from this kind of artificial spectacle, but Petrus tells us that the money the villagers earn from visitors is partially what keeps the indigenous traditions alive—especially in villages such as this, where the families are increasingly a mixed lot of Muslims, Christians, and animists. As soon as we hop out of the canoe and walk up the long wooden dock into town—we're the only visitors in Mancong that day—the full force of the afternoon heat hits us. The dancers, on the other hand—thirty or so villagers ranging in age from toddlers to grannies—are milling about in front of the longhouse, looking perfectly cool and composed. Even the women, who are dressed in heavy, exquisitely embroidered sarongs and silk tops, don't seem to mind the scorching sun. Sulawesi An island the shape of a cartoon dragon, Sulawesi has four colossal peninsulas and an interior riven by mountains. Most visitors flock to the dive resorts in the north, but I'm drawn inland, to the Tana Toraja region, a series of luscious green valleys ringed by violet peaks. You don't just stumble on a place this wonderfully strange. Reaching it requires equal parts resolve and patience. The closest airport is in Makassar, a seething seaport two hundred miles (and several fog-prone mountain passes) away, and the drive from there takes close to ten hours. If one were to order up the quintessential Indonesian landscape, Tana Toraja would be it, with its terraced rice fields, conical-hatted farmers, and the ubiquitous sweet scent of cloves. Look a little closer and there are telltale signs that you're in a place like no other. Those paddies are littered with graves chiseled into every stray slab of limestone. (I quickly learn that the dearly departed are a big part of everyday life for the roughly 400,000 Torajans in the region.) Then there's the distinctive architecture. Many villagers continue to build houses and rice barns in the traditional Torajan style, marked by colorfully painted, hand-carved facades and giant saddle-shaped roofs. One of the local guides tells us that this design, called tongkonan, is meant to mimic the horn of the Torajan people's beloved buffalo. But a local guidebook—a dusty little treatise we unearth at a souvenir shop in Rantepao, Tana Toraja's main town—suggests that the roofs are modeled after ancient praus (Indonesian and Malay sailboats). Legend has it that the first Torajans were Proto-Malay seafarers from Cambodia and Indochina who, a few thousand years ago, made their way to Sulawesi's highlands by traveling up the Sa'dan River. Once on dry land, they turned theirpraus into homes; either that, or they simply built houses the same way they built boats. My guidebook, Toraja: A Unique Culture, by Amir Achsin, goes on to explain that the Torajans still adhere to a traditional class system, with the highest caste owning the most land and buffalo, while the lowest "has nothing but bones and muscles." Known as kaunan, which means slave, "they rely on rich people who are responsible for their welfare," Achsin writes. Fortunately, he adds, the number of kaunan are dwindling with the rise in education. We're staying at the Toraja Heritage Hotel, a sprawling complex with a pool and a gym that looks as though it were built for a tourist boom that never happened. Although a huge buffet is set up for breakfast, we share the dining room with just two other guests, a couple of French retirees. We can't linger too long, it turns out, because our guide—another Petrus (this one Torajan)—has snagged us an invitation to a funeral. Toraja death rituals are famously elaborate, and outsiders are welcome at certain ceremonies. After the missionaries came calling in the first half of the twentieth century, Torajans folded Christianity into their own singular belief system, called Aluk Todolo, in which ancestors' souls play a big role. Honoring the dead ensures good fortune; not doing so brings bad luck and deep shame. "It's embarrassing not to have a ceremony," says Petrus. "If you don't pay your mother and father back in this way, you'll always be in debt." Not surprisingly, since honoring the dead Torajan-style costs a bundle, the upper classes seem to have a lock on the good fortune. The funeral that we attend, for a grandmother in her eighties, is held weeks after her death—and after the family has had a private ceremony. (Burials often take place months, even years, after the death.) For the customary death feast, which lasts several days, we join hundreds of friends and relatives on a large, muddy field near the family home. Most guests have brought sacrificial buffalo and pigs; as foreigners, we're merely expected to gift sugar, cigarettes, or a few rupiah. The mood is more convivial than solemn. We sit on a makeshift bamboo platform, eating palm-sugar cookies and watching a troop of costumed dancers. If it weren't for the casket in the middle of the field and the pigs being hauled away for slaughter, we might be at a county fair. The next day, we visit one of Toraja's prime attractions, the hanging graves at Kete'-Kesu', where some of the decaying coffins, overflowing with skulls and bones, are suspended from the side of the cliff. Stone steps lead up the rock face so visitors can get a close-up view. I'd be more spooked by the scene if it weren't for the young couple canoodling on the stairway and the gaggle of schoolkids asking me to take their picture next to a coffin. As it is, this amalgamation of life and death feels oddly comforting. Java Jakarta and Yogyakarta may share an island, but they could not be less alike. The capital is as steaming and brazen as you might expect of a city with nine million inhabitants, while Yogyakarta, a two-hour flight away, is much smaller (population: 400,000) and more bookish. It's home to Indonesia's best university and to Java's biggest traditional and contemporary arts scene, with many of the best galleries housed in thatched-roof cottages surrounded by rice fields. The artistic tradition is no surprise given the island's impressive lineage—the Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms that ruled for centuries built several elaborately designed religious monuments here, most notably Borobudur, a 113-foot-high pyramid. For one of the world's great construction projects, frustratingly little is known about it. The Buddhist Çailendra dynasty, which ruled Central Java in the eighth and ninth centuries, commissioned it—but why and exactly when, as well as what the name Borobudur means, only Buddha knows. As world landmarks go, Borobudur is pleasurably compact. It takes me no time at all to reach the top just before sunrise. From there, surrounded by stupas, I see a few headlights on the highway below, but they're dwarfed by the mountains beyond. Four volcanoes surround the temple, only one of which is dormant. Merapi has the dubious honor of being the most active volcano in all of Indonesia (its frequent eruptions—the last was in 2010—coat the temple's thousands of statues and reliefs in ash). One minute we're climbing up the temple steps in complete darkness, and the next we're watching daybreak bathe hundreds of massive stone Buddhas in gold. "Look at the mist," I hear a woman tell her companion as they watch the sun creep above the mountains. "You can imagine you're in nirvana." Flores I know embarrassingly little about Flores before my arrival. And what I do know—that hobbitlike hominids once lived here, and that giant man-eating lizards still do—should have kept me far away. But the hobbits are long gone, and I owe it to my reptile-obsessed nephew to issue a firsthand report on the fearsome Komodo dragon. Sumena has returned to the States, and I am once again venturing solo, so I ask my travel agent to plan my itinerary and arrange for a guide. Cornelius—a churchgoing, beer-drinking chatterbox—picks me up at the airport and takes me directly, via fishing boat, to Rinca, one of the three main islands that make up Komodo National Park (the others being Komodo and Padar). Though the dragons hog the spotlight, Cornelius tells me that the area has some of the world's best diving and snorkeling, which accounts for the smattering of luxe live-aboards we see in the bay. The park, along with Flores, belongs to a chain of islands known as Nusa Tenggara, which forms the southern sweep of the Indonesian archipelago. Lombok, Bali's increasingly developed neighbor, as well as the Gili Islands, a pod of party spots for young Australians (see "Infinite Indonesia"), are also part of Nusa Tenggara. They all share the same crystalline waters and—with the exception of Lombok—end-of-the-earth vibe. Flores and the islands just offshore, including Kanawa, are among the loveliest, with their brilliant-green hills and white sand beaches. On Rinca, we spend the afternoon hiking around a scrubby, Hades-hot forest hunting the so-called dragons. The young park ranger who accompanies us explains that they're actually a kind of monitor lizard, which can grow to ten feet and weigh up to three hundred pounds. When we find one, a few feet from the footpath, I quickly zoom my camera lens onto its yellow forked tongue and the bulging muscles of its neck, while the guide rattles off interesting traits: They like to eat deer, pigs, younger dragons—and humans, too. "How fast can it run?" I ask. "Oh, very fast," the ranger says. "Twelve miles per hour." I back away slowly. The next day, I'm scheduled to take another excursion to Komodo Island for more dragon trekking, but the boat ride is four hours each way and I've had my fill of savage beasts. I text Guy Joseph, a young Brit who works for one of the local dive operators, and ask if I'm making a mistake by skipping Komodo. "Go snorkeling instead. You'll have more fun," he texts back. I do, and he is right. I may not have hit all 17,508 islands, but I saw enough of the other Indonesia to know that I'll keep trying. More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
