European stocks advanced, rebounding
after the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index fell to its lowest level in
more than six weeks yesterday, as a U.S. report showed employers
added more workers last month than forecast.  Severn Trent Plc rallied 2.5 percent after a consortium of
investors raised their takeover offer for the U.K. utility. Elan
Corp. gained 5.3 percent after Royalty Pharma increased its
offer to buy the Irish drugmaker. Royal KPN NV jumped 6 percent
after Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. raised its rating on the stock.
 Ipsen (IPN)  SA rose 2.1 percent after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised
buying the shares.  The Stoxx 600 climbed 1.3 percent to 295.4 at the close of
trading. The benchmark gauge still fell 1.8 percent this week,
its biggest weekly drop since April, amid growing speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will scale back monetary stimulus measures
as soon as September.  “A really weak number, say below 90,000, would have been
very bad for equities,” said Andreas Nigg, head of equity and
commodity strategy at Vontobel Asset Management in Zurich. “A
really good number above 250,000 would also have been bad as
that would’ve been more fuel for those looking for the Fed to
exit. So, a number slightly better than expected is probably the
best we could have hoped for in these uncertain times.”  Payrolls in the world’s biggest economy rose 175,000 in May
after a revised 149,000 increase in April that was smaller than
first estimated, a report from the Labour Department showed. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 163,000 gain
last month. The  unemployment rate  rose to 7.6 percent from a
four-year low of 7.5 percent as more Americans entered the
labour force.  Curtail Stimulus  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  in May suggested the central
bank could curtail its bond buying if the job market improves in
a “real and sustainable way.”  In  Germany , the Bundesbank cut its  forecasts  for growth in
Europe’s largest economy for this year and next. The Frankfurt-based central bank reduced its 2013 growth projection to 0.3
percent from the 0.4 percent predicted in December, and said the
economy would expand by 1.5 percent in 2014, compared with the
previous estimate of 1.9 percent.  Severn Trent rallied 2.5 percent to 2,070 pence in  London 
after a consortium of investors including Kuwait Investment
Office, Borealis Infrastructure Management Inc. and Britain’s
Universities Superannuation Scheme raised their offer for the
U.K. utility to 5.3 billion pounds ($8.22 billion).  Elan Offer  Elan gained 5.3 percent to 9.97 euros in Dublin after
Royalty Pharma increased its offer to buy the Irish drugmaker by
5 percent to $6.7 billion. The all-cash bid of $13 per American
depositary receipt is higher than a previous bid of $12.50 and
compares with the $12.68 closing price on June 6.  KPN rallied 6 percent to 1.55 euros.  Sanford Bernstein 
raised its recommendation on the Dutch phone operator partly
owned by  Carlos Slim ’s America Movil SAB to outperform from
market perform, meaning investors should buy the shares.  Ipsen rose 2.1 percent to 27.60 euros after Goldman Sachs
upgraded its rating on the French drugmaker to buy from neutral,
citing a turning point in its transition to growth.  Belgacom SA added 2.9 percent to 17.44 euros. Morgan
Stanley raised the stock to equal weight from underweight,
saying the stock has fallen 30 percent from its peak last year
and that even if it cut its dividend by about 31 percent, it
would still yield 9 percent.  Bellway Reservations  Bellway Plc (BWY)  advanced 1.4 percent to 1,334 pence after the
U.K. homebuilder said reservations in the past four months rose
31 percent from a year earlier as the government’s Help to Buy
initiative gave customers greater access to mortgages.  Elekta AB (EKTAB)  fell 3.8 percent to 102.80 kronor, posting the
worst performance on the equity gauge. Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch cut its rating of the Swedish manufacturer of
radiation-surgery equipment to underperform from neutral,
meaning investors should sell the stock. BofAML said profit
could be disappointing because of research spending and pricing
pressure.  Hochtief AG (HOT)  declined 2 percent to 50.58 euros. Berenberg
Bank AG reduced its recommendation on Germany’s biggest builder
to hold from buy, citing a worsening outlook for Australian
construction and mining.  Lanxess AG, which makes specialty chemicals, plastics and
rubber used in car tires, dropped 1.5 percent to 55.89 euros.
European chemical shares may face cyclical pressures in the
second half of the year as low  consumer confidence  depresses
volume and margins, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in a note.  National benchmark indexes gained in 16 of the 18 western-European markets today.  France ’s CAC 40 added 1.5 percent,
Germany’s DAX climbed 1.9 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose
1.2 percent.  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 11 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
