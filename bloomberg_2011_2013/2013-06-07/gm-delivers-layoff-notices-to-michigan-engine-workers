General Motors Co. (GM) , which is
investing $390 million at a Michigan engine plant, said it will
lay off 430 workers as the factory is shut down for retooling.  The Romulus plant near  Detroit  will make a new, more fuel-efficient V-6 engine once work resumes in late 2015, Robert
Wheeler, a GM spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Our employees know this was coming for a while and that
it will require them being laid off during that period,” he
said. The 430 permanent employees will be furloughed in
different phases beginning in August, he said. Detroit-based GM
said it also has 130 temporary employees that it has no
obligation to retain under its United Auto Workers contract.  GM has said it plans to invest $1.5 billion in North
American facilities this year as the automaker introduces about
20 new or refreshed vehicles to increase sales, gain market
share and boost profits.  GM  gained  1.7 percent to $35.03 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 22 percent this year, compared with a 15
percent increase for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
