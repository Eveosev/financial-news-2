The  Chicago  Blackhawks twice rallied
to defeat the host Los Angeles Kings 3-2 and move within one win
of a place in the Stanley Cup finals.  The Blackhawks lead the best-of-seven Western Conference
finals three games to one and can advance to the National Hockey
League championship series with a win at United Center in
Chicago on June 8.  The series winner will play the Boston Bruins or the
Pittsburgh Penguins for the NHL title. The Bruins can sweep the
Eastern Conference finals with a home win in Game 4 tonight.  Slava Voynov put the defending Stanley Cup-champion Kings
ahead after three minutes, 28 seconds at Staples Center in Los
Angeles last night.  Bryan Bickell tied it 13:16 into the first period and
Dustin Penner restored the Kingsâ€™ lead after 2:12 of the second.
Patrick Kane tied it again with 1:39 left in the period and
Marian Hossa gave the Blackhawks their first lead 1:10 into the
third period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
