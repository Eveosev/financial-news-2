Croydon Pension Fund  will double its
investment with BlueCrest Capital Management LLP, the hedge-fund
firm started by  Michael Platt , after the British municipal
pension plan pulled its money from Fauchier Partners LLP.  The program will put 14 million pounds ($22 million) with
BlueCrest after terminating its investment with Fauchier because
of poor returns, Nigel Cook, Croydon’s head of pensions and
treasury management, said by telephone.  “Performance was the key factor,” Cook said of the
decision. “It was disappointing, and board members felt that
they were looking for something more from Fauchier.” He
wouldn’t give details of Fauchier’s returns, citing a
confidentiality agreement with the  fund manager .  Croydon put 14 million pounds in BlueCrest’s  AllBlue Fund (BABS) ,
which invests in other BlueCrest  hedge funds , in December 2009.
At the same time, it invested a similar sum in Fauchier’s
Jubilee Absolute Return Fund, a fund of hedge funds.  The pension provider is yet to decide whether to add to its
existing holding in AllBlue or invest in another fund managed by
BlueCrest, Cook said. Croydon has no plans to expand its hedge-fund investments beyond the current amount, Cook said.  Permal Group, a unit of  Legg Mason Inc. (LM) , acquired Fauchier
Partners in March. Cook said that takeover wasn’t a factor in
the decision. Alastair Crabbe, a spokesman for Permal, and Ed Orlebar, a spokesman for BlueCrest, both declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
