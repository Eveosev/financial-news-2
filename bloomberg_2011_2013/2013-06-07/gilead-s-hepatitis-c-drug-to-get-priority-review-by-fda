Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) , the world’s
largest maker of HIV medicines, said its experimental hepatitis
C pill, sofosbuvir, will receive a priority marketing review by
U.S. regulators.  Gilead applied to gain approval of the drug in combination
with ribavirin, a current treatment, as an oral therapy for
patients with two types of the virus and with ribavirin and
interferon for patients with other types of the infection who
have never received treatment. The Food and Drug Administration
has set a target review date of Dec. 8, Foster City, California-based Gilead said today in a statement.  Gilead is competing with drugmakers including  Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. (BMY)  and  AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)  to gain approval for oral hepatitis C
treatments that don’t involve injections of interferon, which
can cause flu-like symptoms. Hepatitis C attacks the liver and
can lead to liver cancer. The virus affects about 150 million
people worldwide and the market for new pills is estimated at
$20 billion.  A priority review, granted to drugs that may provide major
advances in treatment, speeds FDA evaluation to eight months,
rather than usual 12.  Gilead gained 3 percent to $52.89 at the close in New York
before the announcement. The stock has more than  doubled  in the
past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
