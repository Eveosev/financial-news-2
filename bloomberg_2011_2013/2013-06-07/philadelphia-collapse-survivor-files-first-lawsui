Nadine White, one of 14 people pulled
alive from the rubble of a collapsed Philadelphia building,
sought more than $50,000 in compensation in the first lawsuit
filed over the accident that killed six.  White filed the lawsuit yesterday in Philadelphia County
Court of Common Pleas seeking compensation from STB Investments
Corp., the owner of the four-story building that collapsed June
5 onto an adjacent thrift shop, and Nicetown House Development
Corp., which does business as Griffin Campbell Construction, the
primary contractor in the building’s demolition.  The court filing doesn’t provide details of White’s
complaint, stating only that more than $50,000 is sought and a
 jury trial  is requested. Richard Basciano of  New York  and
Griffin T. Campbell of Philadelphia are also named as
defendants.  Philadelphia Treasurer Nancy Winkler’s daughter, Anne
Bryan, was one of the six people who died when the building
collapsed, according to the mayor’s office.  The cause of the collapse is being probed, Michael Nutter,
Philadelphia’s mayor, said in a statement.  “We will fully investigate this tragedy and get to the
bottom of what happened, how, when and why,” the mayor said.
“We will determine further actions that must be taken to
prevent such tragedies in the future.”  The case is White v. Basciano, 000987, Court of Common
Please of Philadelphia County (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporters on this story:
