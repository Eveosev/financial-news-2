Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) ,
 India ’s biggest mortgage company, expects central bank approval
soon for a plan to borrow $500 million overseas to finance home
loans for the poor.  The proceeds from the dollar-denominated borrowing will be
used to fund low-cost “affordable housing” projects, V. Srinivasa Rangan,  executive director  at the Mumbai-based
company, said in an interview at his office on June 5.  The  Reserve Bank  of India unveiled rules in December to
allow property developers, mortgage companies and National
Housing Bank, a regulator for home finance lenders, to raise
funds abroad to finance mortgages for the needy. The total that
can be raised under the program for all companies is $1 billion.  “I guess the approval should come soon,” Rangan said.
“We had applied for $500 million with RBI. Currently, this is
the window available for housing finance companies to borrow
overseas.”  Mortgage lenders will cap individual home loan amounts at
2.5 million rupees ($43,800), and the cost of the property
cannot exceed 3 million rupees under the rules. About half the
population in India’s financial hub, Mumbai, lives in slums.  India’s housing industry is largely unregulated and opaque
and consumers are often unable to access sufficient information
or hold builders accountable, according to the government. Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s cabinet approved a bill this month
seeking to regulate the residential housing industry to protect
home buyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
