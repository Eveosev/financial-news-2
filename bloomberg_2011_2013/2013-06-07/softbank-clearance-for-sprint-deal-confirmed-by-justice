SoftBank Corp. (9984)  cleared a U.S.
security review of its proposed $20.1 billion purchase of  Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S) , the  Justice Department  said, confirming a
statement from the companies.  The department said it had “no objection” to the deal in
a letter posted today on the Federal Communications Commission’s
website. The FCC is the final U.S. agency reviewing the bid.  Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  has made a $25.5 billion counteroffer
for Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint, the third-largest U.S.
wireless carrier.  The FCC has gone beyond its 180-day goal for reviewing the
SoftBank deal and faces no deadline for deciding whether to
approve the purchase by the Tokyo-based company’s bid to jump
into the U.S. market.  Dish, based in Englewood,  Colorado , has urged the agency to
delay any action on the SoftBank offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
