The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  dropped as Brazil’s
credit rating outlook was cut to negative by Standard & Poor’s,
which cited sluggish economic growth.  State-controlled oil company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR3)  and
government-run power utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA
slumped as S&P also revised their credit outlooks to negative.
Homebuilder  Gafisa SA (GFSA3)  rallied after agreeing to sell Alphaville
Urbanismo SA to AE Investimentos.  The Ibovespa fell 1.1 percent to 52,318.29 at 10:26 a.m. in
Sao Paulo, extending this week’s decline to 2.2 percent and the
yearly drop to 14 percent.  “The decline this year is based on the same reasons S&P
pointed out to justify its decision, so the agency is confirming
investors’ perceptions,” Marcel Kussaba, the head of equity
research at Quantitas Asset Management, said in a phone
interview from Porto Alegre,  Brazil .  Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, fell 2 percent
to 19.07 reais. Eletrobras declined 3.7 percent to 9.15 reais.
Gafisa rallied 1.5 percent to 4.13 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
