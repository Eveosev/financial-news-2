Russian shares rose for the first
time in three days as OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  rebounded from a four-year low
and oil increased before U.S. data forecast to show more jobs
were added in the biggest crude consumer.  The ruble-based  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.6 percent, the most on
a closing basis since May 28, to 1,325.25 at 11:40 a.m. in
Moscow, trimming a decline this week to 1.8 percent. Crude,
which together with natural gas contributes 50 percent of
 Russia ’s budget revenue, traded near the highest price in seven
days. Mechel, the nation’s biggest coking coal producer, snapped
a seven-day drop of 26 percent.  “Oil is trading at high levels; if it continues to rise,
Russian stocks will recover,” Vitaly Kupeev, an analyst at
Allianz Investments in Moscow, said by phone. “Mechel was
completely sold off; now investors are buying the stock. The
Russian market was oversold on fears the global stimulus program
will be curbed.”  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi yesterday said
the region’s economy should stabilize and recover at a subdued
pace and that more stimulus measures were being left “on the
shelf.”  Europe  is Russia’s biggest trade partner. Employers in
the U.S. probably created as many jobs in May as in the month
before, according to a Bloomberg survey before data due at 8:30
a.m. in  Washington .  Bear Market  The  RTS Index (RTSI$) , which this week entered a  bear market , rose
0.4 percent to 1,292.51. On the benchmark Micex, 44 stocks
increased while six dropped. The measure’s 14-day relative
strength index climbed to 37 today, seven points above the level
which indicates to some analysts that an index is poised to
advance. The  RTS ’s RSI traded within two points of the oversold
level.  Russia-dedicated funds posted $117 million in outflows in
the week ended June 5, according to an e-mailed note from
UralSib Capital, which cited EPFR Global data. This is the
second consecutive week of outflows, after Russia-dedicated
funds lost $78 million the week earlier.  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 45 percent
below the 30-day average. Mechel increased 3.3 percent to 88.90
rubles, after its American depository receipts rose 2.6 percent
to $2.82. The stock’s RSI rose to 25 after falling to 21.  Europe Growth  The $2 trillion economy of Russia is expanding at the
weakest pace since a 2009 contraction. Inflation in Russia
accelerated for a second month in May to the fastest pace in 21
months, limiting the central bank’s scope to cut  interest rates ,
the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said on June 4.  The ECB yesterday cut its growth forecast for this year,
predicting the region’s economy will shrink 0.6 percent from an
estimate of minus 0.5 percent made in March. Policy makers
raised their 2014 forecast to show growth of 1.1 percent.  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, the day
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central
bank could reduce the pace of its asset purchases if officials
see signs of sustained improvement in growth. The Fed buys $85
billion of debt a month to support the economy by putting
downward pressure on interest rates.  Russia’s economy will probably expand 2.3 percent in the
second quarter, according to the median estimate of nine
economists in a Bloomberg survey. That’s less than the 2.5
percent projection a month earlier. The Economy Ministry lowered
this year’s growth forecast to 2.4 percent from 3.6 percent in
April while the central bank kept its refinancing  rate  on hold
for an eighth month in May.  Cheapest Equities  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s biggest lender, increased 0.6
percent to 97.38 rubles. The bank’s five-month profit rose to
157 billion rubles ($4.85 billion) from 155 billion rubles,
according to a statement today.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of commodities added 0.1
percent. Brent oil advanced 0.5 percent to $104.12 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange while crude climbed
0.3 percent to $95.05 in  New York , bringing a gain this week to
3.3 percent.  Urals crude , Russia’s major export blend, increased
0.1 percent to $103.23.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5
times its 12-month estimated earnings, compared with a multiple
of 10 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Ten-day price swings
on the Micex rose to 18.953 today. The Micex has lost 10 percent
this year, underperforming benchmark indexes in  India ,  China ,
Poland and  Hungary .  The Russian Volatility Index tumbled 4.6 percent to 27.68.
The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian
companies in the U.S. increased 0.5 percent to 85.87 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
