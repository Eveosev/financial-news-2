Scatec Solar, a Norwegian solar
developer in which Japanese trading company  Itochu Corp. (8001)  has a
stake, will sell solar power for 20 years to Eskom Holdings SOC,
the South African state-owned utility.  The electricity sales agreement was signed May 9 with power
generation expected to start at the end of 2014, Itochu said in
a statement today.  Scatec is building a plant in Linde in the Northern Cape
province and another in Dreunberg in Eastern Cape, which will
have a combined capacity of 115 megawatts, Daisuke Soda, an
Itochu spokesman, said by phone today.  Itochu has a 37.5 percent stake in Scatec Solar, while
Scatec AS has a majority stake, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
