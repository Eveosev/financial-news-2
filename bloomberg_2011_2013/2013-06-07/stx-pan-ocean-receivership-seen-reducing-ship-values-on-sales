Following are comments from Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an Oslo-based analyst at Arctic Securities
ASA, on the effect on the shipping market of  STX Pan Ocean Co. (028670) ’s
filing for court receivership.  Stavseth commented by e-mail today. A drop in rates left
STX unable to pay off its debt. The company has a fleet of ships
that haul cargoes from grains to cars, its website showed.  “Every vessel is for sale. They are trying to sell what
they think have best value first. The general approach will be
redeliver charter tonnage and sell assets. So more vessels in
sale and purchase market. It may act as a trigger for lower
valuations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
