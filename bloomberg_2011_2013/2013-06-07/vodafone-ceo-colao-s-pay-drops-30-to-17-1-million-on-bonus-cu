Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  Chief Executive
Officer  Vittorio Colao  saw his 2013 pay drop 30 percent on a cut
in bonus from the carrier’s long-term incentive plan.  Colao’s total compensation for the year ended March 31
amounted to 11 million pounds ($17.1 million), compared with
15.8 million pounds a year earlier, according to the Newbury,
England-based company’s  annual report  released today. Income
from long-term incentives fell 34 percent to 7.5 million pounds,
while salary was little changed at 1.1 million pounds.  Vodafone froze base pay for 2013 and 2014 for executive
directors, and almost all members of the executive committee.
The board “is always mindful of both wider conditions as well
as what is happening elsewhere within Vodafone” when
restricting pay, according to the report.  The world’s second-largest wireless carrier last month
reported a 4.2 percent drop in full-year revenue to 44.4 billion
pounds, the first decline since 2005. The company wrote down 7.7
billion pounds on operations in Spain and  Italy  as those
economies’ outlook worsened and competition intensified.  Lowell McAdam, the CEO of Vodafone’s partner in the U.S.,
Verizon Communications Inc., received $14 million in total
compensation last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Verizon owns 55 percent of  Verizon Wireless  and Vodafone holds
the remainder.  Vodafone’s corporation tax came to zero for the second year
in a row in its home country. It had 294 million pounds in
adjusted operating profit in the U.K. for the year ended March
31, down from 402 million pounds a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
