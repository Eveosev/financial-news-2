China’s stocks  fell, capping the
benchmark gauge’s first weekly decline in six weeks, as money-market rates jumped and economists forecast a report tomorrow
will show export growth slowed last month.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , the nation’s biggest
refiner, slid 1.6 percent after the government said it will cut
gasoline prices. Industrial Bank Co. dropped 1.7 percent, adding
to an 8.1 percent slump this week.  China Coal Energy Co. (601898)  led
declines among coal producers. China’s exports may have grown
7.4 percent, half of April’s 14.7 percent, based on the median
estimate of 38 economists. The government will release
industrial output, retail sales, and inflation data on June 9.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell for a seventh day, losing
1.4 percent to 2,210.90 at the close. It slid 3.9 percent this
week, the first decline since the week ended April 26, amid
concerns about slowing economic growth and tighter liquidity.  “Liquidity is tighter in the short term and that’ll weigh
on sentiment,” said Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at Hengsheng
Hongding Asset Management Co. in  Shanghai , which manages $19
million. “The consensus expectations are that the economic data
will be stable and there’s no surprise on either the upside or
the downside. The market is expected to consolidate after the
recent correction.”  The CSI 300 Index lost 1.7 percent to 2,484.16. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong
Kong  sank 1.8 percent. China’s financial markets will be shut
from June 10 to June 12 for the Dragon Boat Festival. The
Bloomberg China-US 55 Index added 1 percent yesterday.  Banks Drop  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 9.2 percent from this
year’s high set on Feb. 6. It trades at 9.1 times 12-month
estimated earnings, compared with the seven-year average of 15.5
times,  data  compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Trading volumes in the index were 10 percent lower than the
30-day average today, while 30-day  volatility  was at 13.7, the
lowest since Dec. 3, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A gauge of financial companies including lenders fell 5.1
percent this week, the most in two months. Industrial Bank,
part-owned by a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, dropped 1.7 percent
to 17.04  yuan .  Shanghai Pudong Development Bank Co. (600000)  dropped 1.1
percent to 9.35 yuan, extending losses to 11 percent this week.
China Everbright Bank Co. slid for a fourth day, losing 0.7
percent to 2.98 yuan.  Tight Liquidity  China Everbright Bank said its relationships with all
trading counterparties are normal after Market News
International reported that it failed to repay an interbank loan
from Industrial Bank on time yesterday.  The nation’s overnight money-market rate climbed to a 16-month high on speculation a cash shortage will worsen as foreign
capital inflows ease. The one-day  repurchase rate  climbed as
much as 2.5 percentage points to 8.67 percent in Shanghai. The
People’s Bank of  China  injected a net 160 billion yuan ($26
billion) of capital into the financial system this week, the
most since February, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Tight liquidity conditions pose risks as  China’s economy  is
highly leveraged, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. Regulations
on shadow banking activity and speculative capital inflows have
likely reduced liquidity, while next week’s holiday has brought
forward demand in early June, Nomura economist Zhang Zhiwei
wrote in a report.  Sinopec,  Asia ’s biggest oil refiner, slid 1.6 percent to
6.60 yuan. PetroChina Co., the nation’s second-largest refiner,
lost 1.1 percent to 8.28 yuan.  The government will cut gasoline prices by 95 yuan per ton
and diesel prices by 90 yuan, the National Development and
Reform Commission said in a statement yesterday.  Economic Outlook  China Coal, the nation’s second-largest coal producer, fell
1.6 percent to 6.32 yuan.  Datong Coal Industry Co. (601001) , the third
largest, dropped 1.7 percent to 7.34 yuan.  A crackdown on fake invoices used to disguise money flows
is probably cutting China’s trade figures, Nomura’s Zhang.
Analysts in a separate survey last month said January-April
export growth was overstated by 4 to 13 percentage points.  Inflation probably accelerated to 2.5 percent last month,
while industrial output grew 9.4 percent, up from 9.3 percent in
April, Bloomberg economist surveys showed.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Chan Tien Hin  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
