Indonesian stocks fell, with the
benchmark index heading for the biggest weekly decline in a
year, on speculation this year’s rally has been excessive.  The  Jakarta Composite index  slid 1.9 percent to 4,905.62 at
the 11:30 a.m. local-time break, paring this year’s gain to 14
percent. The gauge lost 3.2 percent this week, the most since
the five days ended May 18, 2012. The Jakarta index hit a record
high of 5,214.98 on May 20, driving its price-earnings ratio to
20 times, the highest since December 2010. PT Semen  Indonesia ,
the nation’s biggest cement maker, fell 6.3 percent.  PT Unilever
Indonesia (UNVR)  lost 5.5 percent.  “Indonesia has run up sharply, so there’s profit-taking,”
Abdul Jalil Abdul Rasheed, an investment director at Invesco
Asset Management Ltd., said in Singapore by phone. “It’s always
short-term capital that pushes market valuations upwards. When
that is taken out, it causes panic. Panic is good sometimes.”  Foreign institutional investors sold a net $171.2 million
of Indonesian equities on June 3, the most since Aug. 19, 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They were net sellers
in the 10 days through June 5 amid speculation  China ’s economic
growth will slow and the U.S. Federal Reserve may scale back
stimulus spending.  Unilever Indonesia, a unit of the world’s second-biggest
consumer goods company, dropped 5.3 percent today. The shares
fell as investors viewed recent gains as excessive, Kalvin Lie,
an analyst at Panin Sekuritas in Jakarta, said. Unilever rose 19
percent last month. Semen Indonesia headed for its biggest drop
since June 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
