Canada  is threatening to target U.S.
beef and pork in retaliation over stricter country-of-origin
labeling rules for meat.  Canada is preparing to step up its complaint against the
U.S. rules through the  World Trade Organization ’s dispute-resolution process, Canadian Trade Minister Ed Fast and
Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said in an e-mailed joint
statement today.  The Canadian government released a list of commodities for
“possible retaliation,” they said. The list includes beef and
pork, cheese, corn, steel pipes and wood furniture.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said May 23 it will
tighten provisions that specify where animals are born, raised
and slaughtered, even after the WTO backed complaints from
Canada and Mexico that challenged the policy.  “Our government is extremely disappointed that the  United
States  continues to uphold this protectionist policy that the
WTO has ruled to be unfair and call on the U.S. to abide by this
WTO ruling,” Fast and Ritz said in the statement.  The goal of publishing the list is to put pressure on the
Obama administration and Congress, Ritz told reporters on a
conference call today from  Vancouver .  “The Americans find themselves in a political box,” he
said. “They have nailed the lid on themselves and we’re more
than happy to start smashing that box apart with them.”  Canada would retaliate by imposing tariffs on some of the
products in the list, and tariffs could be imposed in as soon as
18 months, Ritz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
