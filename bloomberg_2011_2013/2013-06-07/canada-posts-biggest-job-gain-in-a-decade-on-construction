Canada ’s economy  added  the most jobs
in more than a decade in May led by full-time employment ranging
from construction to retailing, suggesting resilience in
domestic demand while foreign trade remains weak.  Employment rose by 95,000 in May, the most since August
2002, and the  jobless rate  fell to 7.1 percent from 7.2 percent
even as more Canadians joined the workforce, Statistics Canada
said today in Ottawa. The job gain tripled the highest of 25
forecasts in a Bloomberg economist survey that predicted no
change in the unemployment rate.  Payrolls have kept rising even with modest  output growth  in
the world’s 11th largest economy, restrained by what the central
bank calls the weakest export recovery since World War II.
Unemployment will remain at or above 7 percent for another year
according to a separate Bloomberg survey.  “No question this is a staggering report, which puts a
much healthier glow on the outlook for Canadian growth,” said
 Doug Porter , chief economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
“However, the volatility in Canada’s employment reports puts a
massive warning label on this release.”  The Canadian dollar extended gains after the report, and
strengthened 0.7 percent to C$1.0191 per  U.S. dollar  at 4:30
p.m. in Toronto. One dollar buys 98.13 U.S. cents. Canadian
 government bonds  fell, with the yield on the two-year security
rising to 1.13 percent, the highest since February, from 1.05
percent yesterday.  The employment gain was the second largest on record. On a
 percentage basis , the 0.5 percent increase was the largest since
March 2012.  ‘Good Sign’  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said the report is a “good
sign” that government policies are working in an e-mailed
statement. The data come after Statistics Canada said May 31
that economic growth accelerated to a 2.5 percent annualized
pace in the first quarter from 0.9 percent in the last three
months of last year.  “It’s providing some support to indications we are seeing
stronger growth over the first half of this year over the
disappointing second half of last year,” said  Paul Ferley ,
assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.  Construction accounted for almost half the gains in May,
rising by 42,700. The retail and wholesale category rose 27,200,
followed by the “other services” category at 21,500 and
business and building services at 21,300.  Full-time Jobs  Full-time employment rose by 76,700 in May while part-time
work advanced by 18,200, Statistics Canada said. Private
companies added 94,600 workers and public-sector employment rose
by 6,600. More than 80,000 people joined the  labor force  in May,
pushing the participation rate to 66.7 percent from 66.5
percent.  Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, had its jobless
rate decline to the lowest since November 2008, falling to 7.3
percent on a 50,600 job gain.  Workers designated by  Statistics Canada  as employees rose
by 101,200 while the self-employed decreased by 6,200.  Average hourly  wages  of permanent employees rose 2 percent
in May from a year earlier, lagging the prior reading of 2.8
percent.  The labor market still hasn’t returned to where it was
before the last recession. Unemployment averaged 6.2 percent in
the five years before Canada’s last recession began around the
end of 2008, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz told lawmakers
yesterday the economy suffered long-lasting damage from that
recession and likened the global recovery to a postwar
reconstruction.  “Canada will have another couple months of strong growth”
based on gains in new job listings, Kelly Dixon, president of
the Workopolis job-search website, said in a telephone
interview. Lowering the  unemployment rate  will be more
“difficult,” she said.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada today said that the
nation’s labor  productivity  rose 0.2 percent in the first
quarter, the fastest in more than a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
