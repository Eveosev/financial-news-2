U.S. stock-index futures rose after a
report showed employment increased more than forecast in May and
the jobless rate climbed from a four-year low as more Americans
entered the  labor force .  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index futures expiring this month
added 0.3 percent to 1,626.70 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York .  Payrolls rose 175,000 last month after a revised 149,000
increase in April that was smaller than first estimated, Labor
Department figures showed today in Washington. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for a 163,000 gain. The
 unemployment rate  rose to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent.  Investors have scrutinized labor-market data as Fed policy
makers continue to debate whether the economy is strong enough
to begin reducing monetary stimulus. Data yesterday showed
initial jobless claims fell by 11,000 to 346,000 in the week
ended June 1. A report June 5 indicated companies in the U.S.
hired fewer workers than projected in May.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
