South African pace bowler Morne Morkel will miss the remainder of the  International Cricket
Council ’s Champions Trophy after straining his quad in the
Proteas’s loss to India yesterday.  Chris Morris will take Morkel’s spot in South African
squad, the  tournament’s organizers  said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “Morne had a MRI scan done on him last night and it
confirmed a Grade 1 injury to his left qaudricep muscle,”
Proteas team manager Mohammed Moosajee said in the statement.
“His recovery time will take almost three weeks because the
scan also detected a tear to the connecting tissue that
surrounds the muscle which is called a myofascial tear, so that
rules him out of the tournament.  South Africa  is grouped with Pakistan, West Indies and
India, which defeated the Proteas by 26 runs yesterday in
Cardiff.  Australia said earlier today that captain  Michael Clarke 
has been ruled out of his side’s first group match of the ICC
Champions Trophy against England because he hasn’t recovered yet
from a back injury. He may be available to play against New
Zealand.  Sri Lanka  is the fourth team in Group A.  To contact the reporter on this story:
