Rubber rebounded on speculation that
companies in  China , the world’s largest user, may step up
purchases after the Lunar New Year holiday to replenish
stockpiles amid tightening supply.  The July-delivery contract gained as much as 2.1 percent to
501.3 yen a kilogram ($6,090 a metric ton) before settling at
498.9 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The most-active
contract had the biggest one-day drop since Jan. 26 yesterday,
retreating from a record 504 yen reached on Feb. 4.  China will resume trade tomorrow after the weeklong holiday.
Natural-rubber inventories monitored by the  Shanghai  Futures
Exchange stood at 58,673 tons, 61 percent below last year’s peak
of 151,832 tons, the bourse said on Feb. 1.  “Rubber is buoyed by expectations that Chinese buying may
gather pace,” Kazunori Kokubo, general manager at Tokyo-based
broker Yutaka Shoji Co., said today by phone. “The approach of
wintering is another support to the market.”  Farmers reduce tapping during the so-called wintering
period from February to May, when trees shed leaves and latex
production drops. Thai rubber output declines as much as 60
percent during wintering compared with peak levels, according to
the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries.  “Key rubber plantation areas in  Thailand ,  Indonesia  and
Malaysia are entering the low-production season around the end
of the month,” Chaiwat Muenmee, an analyst at DS Futures Co.,
said by phone from Bangkok, forecasting that prices will gain.  Improved Demand  Rubber futures have gained 20 percent this year, extending
last year’s 50 percent rally, as rising car sales led by China
and  India  improved demand for tires. Output from Thailand,
Indonesia and Malaysia, which account for about 70 percent of
global supply, were curbed as a La Nina has led to higher-
than-average rains in parts of  Southeast Asia . The weather event
started in June and usually lasts for nine months or more.  The Thai cash price extended gains to an all-time high of
185.80 baht ($6.06) per kilogram today on concern there may be
supply shortages in Thailand and  Malaysia  during the low-output
period, the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand said today.  The Shanghai market is closed today for the Lunar New Year.
May-delivery rubber in Shanghai climbed to a record 41,850 yuan
($6,350) a ton on Jan. 31.  Natural-rubber consumption in China may rise 9 percent to
3.6 million tons this year, while rubber use in India may gain
5.2 percent to 991,000 tons, according to the Association of
Natural Rubber Producing Countries.  Natural-rubber output in India, the fourth-biggest producer,
gained 2.8 percent in the 10 months through January as favorable
weather and record prices boosted production, the state-run
 Rubber Board  said yesterday.  Production totaled 749,950 tons in the April-to-January
period, compared with 729,250 tons a year earlier, the board
said in a statement. Output was 98,800 tons last month, little
changed from 97,500 tons a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
