  Portugal ’s sale of 3.5 billion euros
($4.8 billion) of five-year notes yesterday takes the nation
close to meeting its funding needs before some securities mature
in April, according to Royal Bank of Canada Europe Ltd.  “The syndication met healthy demand,” Norbert Aul, a
rates strategist in London, wrote in an investor note dated
yesterday. “This clearly eases the refinancing pressure of the
upcoming bond redemption wall.”  Portugal’s sale of the securities maturing in February 2016
drew more than 7 billion euros of bids from 160 participants,
debt office IGCP said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.
Investors from Portugal bought 31 percent of the notes, the
largest group, followed by U.K. buyers with 23 percent of the
debt, it said. Asia investors bought 7 percent. The nation took
advantage of an “attractive window” for the sale of notes,
which were priced to yield 6.457 percent, IGCP said.  While Portugal has covered about 30 percent of its bond
funding target for this year, it probably needs another sale
before the debt redemption in mid-April, RBC said. The nation’s
financing costs at current levels “cannot be sustainable over
the long run, while the next refinancing wall is mounting even
higher in June,” Aul wrote in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
