Asian stocks fluctuated as gains by
financial companies after  National Australia Bank Ltd . reported
higher profit were tempered by losses among Taiwanese technology
firms.  National Australia Bank, Australia’s fourth-largest bank,
climbed 1.9 percent in Sydney and  Commonwealth Bank of Australia ,
the biggest by market value, rose 0.8 percent. Gigabyte
Technology Co. lost 3.6 percent in Taipei after reports it will
recall computers with flawed Intel Corp. chips, while Powerchip
Technology Corp.,  Taiwan ’s largest memory-chip maker, slid 1.4
percent after reporting a loss.  “Overall, corporate earnings and corporate activity are
broadly supportive of the notion that economies are in a solid
recovery phase,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1
billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “With levels of
corporate activity, particularly in the U.S., appearing to
accelerate, the confidence in a more robust future appears to be
increasing.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.2 percent to 139.69
as of 7:44 p.m. in Tokyo, set to close at its highest level
since Jan. 19. The benchmark gauge last week climbed 1.4 percent
for the sharpest weekly increase this year as improving
corporate earnings overshadowed concern over  Egypt ’s political
instability.  Financial stocks contributed the most to the MSCI Asia
Pacific index’s gains today, while technology companies were the
biggest drag.  U.S. Deals  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 0.4 percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.5 percent, and  South
Korea ’s Kospi Index retreated 0.6 percent after earlier climbing
0.5 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.3 percent after
advancing 0.3 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index rose 0.6 percent in New York yesterday
after Danaher Corp. agreed to acquire Beckman Coulter Inc. for
$6.8 billion, and Ensco Plc said it will buy Pride International
Inc. for $7.3 billion.  “Stocks will likely continue to rise since U.S. business
sentiment is improving steadily,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who
oversees about $450 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment
Management Co. “As global competition intensifies, strategic
M&A that is aimed at strengthening competitiveness by expanding
the scale of operations is spreading globally.”  National Australia Bank advanced 1.9 percent to A$25.48 in
Sydney after posting an 18 percent increase in first-quarter
profit and saying it’s well placed to absorb fallout from
government banking reforms and natural disasters.  Australian Financials  Rival Commonwealth Bank, the nation’s biggest lender by
market value, climbed 0.8 percent to A$53.92 and  Westpac Banking
Corp ., the second biggest, added 1.1 percent to A$23.66. Lenders
included in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that since January 1
have reported earnings that exceeded analyst estimates outnumber
those that have disappointed by almost three-to-one, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  KDDI Corp., Japan’s second-largest mobile-phone company,
rose 5.8 percent to 506,000 yen after Credit Suisse Group AG
raised its rating to “outperform.” In  Seoul , Doosan Infracore
Co., South Korea’s largest construction-equipment maker, gained
3.9 percent to 30,950 won as JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised its
investment rating to “overweight” from “neutral.”  Earnings Statements  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.2 percent this year
to the last close, compared with gains of 4.9 percent by the S&P
500 and 4.7 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the  S&P 500  and 11.4 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Today, 30 of the 1,019 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 347 that have
reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 139 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 109 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gigabyte Technology Co. lost 3.6 percent to NT$31.05 in
Taipei, where markets resumed trading after the Lunar New Year
holiday.  Asustek Computer Inc . sank as much as 2.3 percent
before recovering losses. The two companies will recall personal
computers containing flawed Intel chips, Apple Daily News
reported Feb. 3.  That will reduce Asustek’s revenue this month by more than
NT$1 billion ($34 million), the newspaper reported, citing David
Chang, the company’s chief finance officer, while Gigabyte said
in a news release that consumers may contact retail stores about
the recall.  Powerchip Technology fell 1.4 percent to NT$6.89 after
reporting a fourth-quarter net loss of NT$8.33 billion, compared
with profit of NT$1.6 billion a year earlier, the Hsinchu,
Taiwan-based company said in a Jan. 31 statement. Its shares
previously traded on Jan. 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
