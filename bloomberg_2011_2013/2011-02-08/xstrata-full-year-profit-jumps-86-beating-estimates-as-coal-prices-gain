  Xstrata Plc , the largest exporter of
coal used for power, said annual profit surged 86 percent as
rising demand in emerging markets pushed up prices, and forecast
lower Asian growth this year.  Net income before exceptional items rose to $5.15 billion
from $2.77 billion a year earlier, Zug, Switzerland-based
Xstrata said today in a statement. That beat the $5.02 billion
average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Developing economies and China in particular appear set
to continue to achieve wholly respectable high single-digit
growth rates in 2011,” Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis said
in the statement. Growth will be below 2010 levels because of
inflation and government measures to contain expansion to within
“manageable levels,” he said.  Xstrata’s earnings advanced as commodity prices jumped. The
average price of power-station coal at  Australia ’s Newcastle
port, a benchmark for  Asia , rose to $99 a metric ton in 2010
from $72 a year earlier, according to McCloskey Group. Copper,
Xstrata’s other main product, averaged $7,558, up 45 percent.  “Overall these were a strong and impressive set of
numbers,” David Butler, a London-based analyst at JPMorgan
Cazenove, said in a note to investors, citing unit cost savings
of $541 million.  Shares Gain  Xstrata rose 25 pence, or 1.7 percent, to 1,492.5 pence by
the 4:30 p.m. close of London trading.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization totaled $10.39 billion, compared with the $10.08
billion average estimate of 18 analysts. Xstrata posted earnings
per share of $1.77, beating the $1.72 average projection of 21
analysts. Net debt fell 38 percent to $7.6 billion.  Xstrata plans to boost output 50 percent through 2014 to
take advantage of Asian demand.  China , the biggest coal user,
raised purchases to a record 165 million tons in 2010, according
to a Jan. 21 report by the General Administration of Customs.
That may reach 210 million tons this year,  Helen Lau , a Hong
Kong-based analyst at UOB Kay Hian Ltd., said on Jan. 11.  Xstrata’s coal output fell 6 percent in 2010 to 79.9
million tons after planned closures and heavy rains in Australia
curbed production. Mined copper output rose to 913,500 tons from
907,000 tons, contributing $2.2 billion to operating profit,
while copper cathode, a finished form of the metal, declined 1.5
percent to 715,499 tons, the company said. Copper was the
largest contributor to earnings last year, followed by coal.  Coal, Copper  The company retains 25 percent of  Lonmin Plc  after ending a
hostile bid for the platinum producer in October 2008 as metal
prices plunged. Xstrata is studying options for its Lonmin
holding, including selling the stake, Davis said today in a
telephone interview.  “There will be a rational solution to the Lonmin
investment,” he said. “When the time is right we’ll try to do
something which is very value-creating for our shareholders.”  Xstrata will continue to focus on organic growth projects,
while not ruling out acquisitions, Davis said. The company’s
growth projects are “as transformational as any significant
transforming acquisition we’ve done in the past,” he said.  The company is interested in acquiring Drummond Co.’s
Colombian coal assets, two people with knowledge of the matter
said in December. Xstrata was the only bidder to submit a fully
funded offer for the $8 billion unit by a deadline that month,
the London-based  Sunday Times  said in January.  “Drummond has very good assets in  Colombia  but the
decision on what to do with them really is Drummond’s, not
ours,” Davis said today, declining to comment on whether
Xstrata had negotiated on or bid for the unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
