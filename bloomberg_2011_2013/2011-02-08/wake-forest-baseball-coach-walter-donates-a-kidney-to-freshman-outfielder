Wake Forest University  baseball coach
Tom Walter donated a kidney to freshman outfielder Kevin Jordan,
a draft pick of the  New York Yankees .  In a procedure performed yesterday at the Emory Transplant
Center in Atlanta, Walter, 42, had a kidney removed and given to
the 19-year-old Jordan, according to the university’s  website .
Both operations were a success and both men should make a full
recovery, the website said.  Jordan, who was picked by the Yankees in the 19th round of
2010 Major League Baseball Draft, suffers from  ANCA vasculitis ,
an autoimmune disease that causes the destruction of blood
vessels through inflammation. Jordan was diagnosed in April
2010, after losing 20 pounds during a bout with the flu. Doctors
discovered that his kidney function was 15 percent to 20 percent
normal and said a transplant would be necessary, according to
the university.  In December, after Jordan’s family members were deemed
incompatible for donation, Walter decided to undergo testing. On
Jan. 28, the first day of spring practice, he was informed that
he and Jordan were a match, the university said on the website.  Walter is entering his second season as coach of the Demon
Deacons, posting an 18-37 record last year. Prior to his arrival
at the school in Winston-Salem,  North Carolina , he spent five
years at the University of  New Orleans .  To contact the reporter on this story:
