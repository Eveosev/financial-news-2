Epir Technologies Inc., a U.S.
developer of photovoltaic materials, said it produced solar
cells on commercial glass from polycrystalline cadmium
telluride, turning light into power with higher efficiency.  Tests demonstrated a maximum efficiency rate of 15.2
percent, the Bolingbrook, Illinois-based company said in a
statement. The U.S. Energy Department’s National Renewable
Energy Laboratory supervised the experimental test results.  “This achievement elevates Epir to the very small group of
solar companies and research facilities that have reproducibly
fabricated CdTe solar cells with greater than 15 percent
efficiency,” Timothy Coutts, fellow emeritus of the Golden,
Colorado-based laboratory, said in the statement.  Epir, led by Chief Executive Officer Siva Sivananthan, is
among technology companies that are developing thin-film solar
cells as a cheaper alternative to conventional silicon-based
cells. Thin film uses materials that are laid in sheets onto
surfaces of roof shingles or building blocks. One of those is
the compound formed from cadmium and tellurium.  A spokesman with the federal research laboratory wasn’t
available for comment today before normal business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
