     Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) --  3M Co ., the maker of  Post-It Notes 
and films to brighten TV screens, approved a stock-repurchase
plan of as much as $7 billion and increased its quarterly
dividend by 5 percent.  The dividend will rise to 55 cents a share from 52.5 cents,
payable March 12 to shareholders of record on Feb. 18, 3M said
today in a statement. 3M’s new share-buyback plan has no set
closing date, the  St. Paul , Minnesota-based company said.  3M, which generated $4.1 billion of free  cash flow  last
year, is steering cash to shareholders after spending at least
$2 billion on acquisitions in 2010. The buyback amount matches
the repurchase announced in February 2007, the highest in 3M’s
history, Jacqueline Berry, a spokeswoman, said in an interview.  The new dividend payment falls short of the projected
increase to 56 cents, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.
Dividends will probably keep increasing between the rate of
inflation and the rate of earnings growth, and the company will
place “a little more emphasis on stock repurchases” this year,
Chief Executive Officer  George Buckley  said Jan. 25.  3M had about 712 million shares outstanding as of Dec. 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Based on today’s
closing price, the buyback plan would cover about 78.2 million
shares, or about 11 percent of those outstanding.  The shares rose as much as $1.38 to $90.85 in extended
trading, after closing up 68 cents to $89.47 at 4 p.m. in the
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
