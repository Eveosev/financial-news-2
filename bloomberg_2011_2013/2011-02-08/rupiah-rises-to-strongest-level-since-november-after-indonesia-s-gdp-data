  Indonesia ’s rupiah strengthened to
the highest level in almost three months after the economy
expanded at the fastest pace in six years last quarter.  Government bonds  advanced.  Gross domestic product increased 6.9 percent in the three
months through December from a year earlier, the most since the
quarter ended December 2004, the statistics bureau said
yesterday. The currency has advanced 1.6 percent so far this
month, the third-best performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded
currencies, as exchange data show overseas funds bought $21
million more shares than they sold during the period.  “Investors are comfortable with the positive outlook on
Indonesia’s economy,” said Wiwig Santoso, head of treasury and
markets at PT Bank DBS Indonesia in Jakarta. “Funds seem to be
flowing into the country.”  The rupiah rose 0.5 percent to 8,913 per dollar as of 3:15
p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency touched 8,910, the strongest level since Nov. 12.    Bank Indonesia  unexpectedly lifted its  reference rate  to
6.75 percent from a record-low 6.50 percent on Feb. 4, the first
increase since October 2008, as inflation accelerated in January.  Consumer prices in Southeast Asia’s biggest economy rose
7.02 percent last month from a year earlier, after a 6.96
percent gain in December, Central Bureau of Statistics data
showed Feb. 1.  Government bonds gained for a third consecutive day, with
the yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 dropping two
basis points to 8.68 percent, according to midday prices by the
Inter-Dealer Market Association. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Overseas funds  have increased their holdings of Indonesian
government debt to 195 trillion rupiah ($21.7 billion) as of Feb.
1, from 191.2 trillion rupiah by the end of November, according
to the  finance ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
