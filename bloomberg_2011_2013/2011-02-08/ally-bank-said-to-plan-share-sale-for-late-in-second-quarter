Ally Financial Inc. filed for an
initial public offering of the U.S. government’s majority stake
as part of the auto and home lender’s plan to regain its
independence.  The size, price and timing for the sale haven’t been set,
Detroit-based Ally said today in a statement. Ally chose
 Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  to underwrite the sale, according to the
statement.  The U.S. Treasury Department holds a 74 percent stake in
Ally’s common shares after funding at least three rounds of aid
totaling $17.2 billion during the financial crisis. Ally,
formerly known as GMAC Inc., was deemed crucial to the survival
of the  auto industry  by U.S. regulators.  Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter, 64, returned the
lender to profitability last year with $1.08 billion in net
income. The company had almost collapsed as losses piled up from
subprime home lending.  Ally made more new-car loans than any other lender last
year, according to Experian Automotive, a Costa Mesa,
California-based firm that tracks auto-lending data. The company
remains one of the biggest lenders to dealers of  General Motors
Co. (GM) , its former parent, which still has a stake in Ally. Other
stakeholders include investors affiliated with Cerberus Capital
Management LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
