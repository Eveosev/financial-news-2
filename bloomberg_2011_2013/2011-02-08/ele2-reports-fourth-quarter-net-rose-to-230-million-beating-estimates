  Tele2 AB ,  Sweden ’s second-largest
telephone company, reported fourth-quarter net income that beat
estimates as it expanded in  Russia  and reached profit in  Croatia .  Net income was 1.50 billion kronor ($230 million), from
1.10 billion kronor a year earlier. Revenue from continuing
operations gained 1.6 percent to 10.1 billion kronor. Analysts
had anticipated net income of 1.12 billion kronor on sales of
10.1 billion kronor.  The margin for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization increased to 25 percent in the quarter from 23
percent a year earlier, helped by Russia and Croatia. Higher
smartphone usage boosted revenue in Sweden. Tele2 plans to seek
new mobile licenses in Russia this year, Chief Executive Officer
Mats Granryd said in a  statement  today.  “Preparing ourselves for a more data-centric future, be it
either through data licenses or technology-neutral regulation,
we will continue to look for opportunities to expand our
existing footprint,” Granryd said.  The company signed up 755,000 new Russian customers in the
quarter, 34 percent less than a year earlier, to reach 18.4
million users. It aims to exceed 20 million Russian customers
this year.  “Tele2 Russia will keep looking for possibilities to
carefully expand its operations through new licenses as well as
by complementary acquisitions,” the company said.  Tele2 targets capital expenditure of no more than 5.5
billion kronor this year, excluding licenses, and aims to
improve profitability in Russia as it adds subscribers.  The company proposes a 27-kronor dividend on its 2010
earnings.  The formerly unprofitable Croatian unit recorded 3 million
kronor in profit at the Ebitda level as Tele2 rolled out a data
network and made less use of roaming.  The company signed a 2.5 billion-kronor credit facility
with five banks, it said in a separate statement.    TeliaSonera AB  is Sweden’s biggest telephone company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
