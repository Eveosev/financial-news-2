UBS AG,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank,
said concern over the euro-region sovereign debt crisis and the
impact of central bank asset purchases increased market
volatility, boosting its currency business.  “This resulted in subdued client risk-appetite, especially
in credit, where revenues declined, and emerging markets,
although it benefited our foreign exchange business,” the bank
said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
