European online job advertisements
showed the biggest annual gain since the end of the recession,
recruiter  Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW)  said.  The Monster Employment Index Europe rose 26 percent in
March to 131 from 125 a year earlier, New York-based Monster
said in a report today. The index advanced from 125 in February,
driven by demand from factories in Germany, Sweden and  France .  Demand was strongest among manufacturers and maintenance
and repair companies. That offset reduced hiring from European
governments that are trying to slash deficits and in state-
funded arts industries.  “Manufacturing and exports remain a key driver of
recruitment across the continent,” Alan Townsend, Monster’s
head of operations for Europe, said in the report. “It is still
very apparent that household and government spending trends are
continuing to weigh on recruitment activity across the arts and
public-sector industries.”  Online job vacancies in manufacturing, maintenance and
repair rose 64 percent across  Europe  in March from a year
earlier, while ads for engineers rose 42 percent. Offers for
accountants, auditors and tax consultants rose 14 percent.
Demand in banking, finance and insurance rose 5 percent.  Germany, Sweden and France posted the biggest increases
with gains of 45 percent, 22 percent and 21 percent,
respectively.  Monster’s employment index is based on job-search websites
from all European Union members, including Monster Worldwide’s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
