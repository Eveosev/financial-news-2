Australia applied to Cricket World
Cup organizers for permission to replace injured batsman  Mike Hussey  and spin bowler Nathan Hauritz in its 15-man squad.  Cricket Australia said today it sought approval for Callum
Ferguson to replace Hussey and Jason Krejza to take Hauritz’s
spot. Hussey was ruled out with a hamstring tendon injury and
Hauritz by a shoulder dislocation.  Selectors “determined that the best strategy to ensure a
successful campaign is for Australia to enter the tournament
with a fully fit squad of fifteen from the first game,”
Chairman of Selectors Andrew Hilditch said in an e-mailed
statement.  Captain Ricky Ponting is “going well” in his
rehabilitation following a finger fracture, Australian team
physiotherapist Alex Kountouris added.  Australia starts its bid to win a fourth straight  World Cup 
title Feb. 21 against Zimbabwe in Ahmedabad. The tournament will
be co-hosted by  India , Sri Lanka and Bangladesh from Feb. 19 to
April 2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
