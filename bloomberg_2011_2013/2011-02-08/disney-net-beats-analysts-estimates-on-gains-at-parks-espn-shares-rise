  Walt Disney Co ., the world’s biggest
theme-park company, reported first-quarter profit that beat
analysts’ estimates after an increase in attendance at its
resorts and advertising sales growth at ESPN. The shares rose.  Net income rose to $1.3 billion, or 68 cents a share, from
$844 million, or 44 cents, a year earlier, Burbank, California-
based Disney said today in a statement. Profit beat the 56-cent
average of 23 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
rose 10 percent to $10.7 billion, also topping estimates.  The recovering economy drove attendance gains at Disney
theme parks and advertising growth at cable networks led by
ESPN.  Anthony DiClemente , an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in  New
York , predicted 3 percent higher attendance at parks in  Orlando ,
Florida. Analysts on average projected sales of $10.5 billion.  “Their strength was across the board,” said Michael Morris, an analyst with Davenport & Co. in Richmond,  Virginia ,
who recommends the stock. “They were ahead of my expectations
and that of the Street on nearly every front.”  Theme-park income increased 25 percent to $468 million as
revenue expanded 8 percent to $2.87 billion. Earnings at
Disney’s TV operations gained 47 percent to $1.07 billion,
boosted by gains at ESPN, which aired two newly acquired college
bowl games in the quarter.  Disney’s cable revenue gained 16 percent to $3.07 billion,
led by higher fees and advertising sales at ESPN and the Disney
Channel. Profit increased 42 percent to $771 million.  The company’s ABC broadcast unit boosted revenue 4 percent
to $1.58 billion as Disney’s local TV stations increased
advertising sales. Profit increased 64 percent to $295 million
after ESPN took over the Rose Bowl telecast and ABC reduced its
news and daytime production cost.  Disney rose 3.4 percent to $42.60 in extended trading. The
shares added 24 cents to $41.18 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading and have advanced 9.8 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
