U.S. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates 
praised  Egypt ’s military for an “exemplary” response to the
country’s political turmoil and urged the government to press
forward with promised changes at “a steady pace.”  “Continuing to move forward on this and fulfilling the
promises that have been made, I think, is quite critical,” said
Gates, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon today after an
unrelated ceremony with French Defense Minister Alain Juppe. The
Egyptian military’s handling of the situation has “made a
contribution to the evolution of democracy and what we’re seeing
in Egypt,” Gates said.  The transition under way should be “orderly,” Gates said,
in his first public remarks on the Egyptian crisis since
demonstrations began two weeks ago demanding the ouster of
President  Hosni Mubarak . Gates has spoken at least four times
with his Egyptian counterpart, Defense Minister Field Marshal
Hussein Tantawi, who also became deputy prime minister in a
Cabinet reshuffle by Mubarak in response to the protests.  Egyptian protesters packed Cairo’s Tahrir Square again
today in what have largely been peaceful gatherings since last
week, when the square was the scene of violent confrontations
between the demonstrators and pro-Mubarak loyalists.  Gates praised the Egyptian military’s conduct during the
events. Human rights groups have been critical of actions by the
military police, including detentions of activists over the
weekend.  Military Behavior  “The Egyptian military has behaved relatively responsibly
on Tahrir Square,” said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for
New York-based Human Rights Watch. “But to say that their
behavior has been exemplary overall is extremely unfortunate,
given their documented involvement in the arrest and torture of
Egyptian activists and journalists in the last few days.”  The White House today called for the Egyptian government
“first and foremost” to “stop arresting protesters and
journalists.” Authorities also must end harassment, beatings
and detentions of reporters and activists, White House press
secretary  Robert Gibbs  said.  State Department spokesman  Philip J. Crowley , while calling
the Egyptian military “constructive,” said yesterday that the
U.S. had raised issues of abuses. He said news reports had cited
military police units “involved at some point” in alleged
abuses.  ‘Pivotal Role’  The Egyptian army at times has intervened to keep opposing
groups apart in Tahrir Square.  The Obama administration “needs to be careful here,”
Malinowski said. “The Egyptian people respect their military
and accept that it has a pivotal role to play in a transition,
but they do not want to live in a military state.”  Egypt needs “a transition that continues to move forward,
and a transition where people can see a steady pace in
implementing the number of reforms that have been announced and
to which the Egyptian government has committed,” Gates said.  Vice President  Omar Suleiman  has been leading talks with
opposition groups and has promised democratic changes, including
amendments to the Egyptian constitution and relaxing news media
restrictions.  “I think that the Egyptian military has conducted itself
in an exemplary fashion during this entire episode,” Gates
said. “They have acted with great restraint and, frankly, they
have done everything that we have indicated we would hope that
they would do.”  Juppe, at the Pentagon to sign a statement of principles on
space cooperation with Gates, said Egypt should adopt changes
“without violence and as soon as possible,” under a timeline
worked out by the Egyptians.  Power Vacuum  One of the first priorities must be for the opposition to
get organized, Juppe said. Analysts including Soner Cagaptay of
the Washington Institute for Near East Policy have said years of
repression have hindered the development of viable opposition
groups that could successfully challenge the regime in organized
elections.  U.S. officials and partner nations in  Europe  and the region
also have expressed concern that any power vacuum during a
transition might allow Islamist groups, such as the Muslim
Brotherhood, to dominate.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  cited such a prospect
during a security conference in Munich over the weekend, saying
Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman’s transition process may
provide a way of easing Mubarak aside without allowing “forces
at work in any society” to “derail the process to pursue their
own agenda.”  Juppe today rejected any notion that Western nations must
either back authoritarian regimes or face “Islamic chaos.”  “We now have to bet on democratic forces that will emerge
and will not confiscate democracy in favor of other things after
elections, as unfortunately has happened elsewhere. I think this
bet must be taken.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
