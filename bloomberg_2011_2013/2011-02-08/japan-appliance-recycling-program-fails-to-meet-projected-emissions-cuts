Japan’s recycling program for
electric appliances cut only about one-sixth of an earlier
estimate for carbon dioxide emissions, according to the latest
projections, officials said.  “It is true our estimate was rough,” Environment Minister
Ryu Matsumoto said at a briefing today. He said the original
estimate was “based on an assumption that consumers would trade
an item made in 1995 for another of the same size.”  The  Environment Ministry  made an estimate before the start
of the recycling program in May 2009 that reductions would be 4
million metric tons through March 2010, Takeo Sugii, a deputy
director at the ministry, said by phone.  In March 2010, the ministry reviewed the program and cut
its reduction estimate to 690,000 tons, he said.  The discrepancies occurred because the earlier estimate was
made using products made in 1995 as a baseline and that “may
have been too old,” Sugii said.  He also said consumers are buying bigger television sets,
which use more power even though they have higher efficiency.  The “Eco Point System” program allows consumers to earn
points that are tradable for goods and gift certificates when
they switch to energy efficient television sets, air
conditioners and fridges.  The program, introduced by the government to promote the
use of energy efficient products and curb emissions, is due to
end next month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
