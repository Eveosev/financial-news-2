The pound rose against the dollar for
the first day in four after a house-price gauge showed the
highest reading since July and the British Retail Consortium
reported a jump in sales.  The U.K. currency stayed near the strongest level in almost
three weeks against the euro. The number of real-estate agents
and surveyors saying prices fell exceeded those seeing gains by
31 percentage points last month, the  Royal Institution  of
Chartered Surveyors said. Sales at stores open at least 12
months, measured by value, rose 2.3 percent from a year earlier
in January, according to the BRC. Britain is due to sell 1
billion pounds ($1.6 billion) of inflation-linked bonds today.  The pound gained 0.3 percent to $1.6156 as of 7:58 a.m. in  London . Against the euro, it was little changed at 84.39 pence,
after appreciating to 83.89 pence yesterday, the strongest level
since Jan. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
