A  Walt Disney Co . unit and four other
movie studios sued the operators of Hotfile.com for copyright
infringement, claiming the website facilitates the theft of
motion pictures and television content.  News Corp.’s Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., Universal
City Studios Productions LLLP,  Sony Corp .’s Columbia Pictures
Industries Inc. and  Time Warner Inc .’s Warner Bros.
Entertainment Inc. joined Disney in the suit, according to a
complaint filed today in federal court in Miami.  “Hotfile is a commercial online hub for distributing
popular entertainment content without authorization, including
hundreds of thousands of copies of the plaintiffs’ copyrighted
works,” according to the complaint.  Users of Hotfile pay a monthly fee to download content,
including movies playing in theaters, from the company’s
computer servers, the studios said in their complaint. Hotfile
is operated by Anton Titov, who is also a named defendant,
according to the filing.  Titov and a Hotfile representative didn’t immediately
return an e-mail message seeking comment.  The  Motion Picture Association  of America Inc. today
announced the suit in an e-mailed statement.  The case is Disney Enterprises Inc. v. Hotfile Corp.,
11-20427, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida
(Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
