President  Barack Obama  will ask
Congress next week to approve a six-year, $53 billion program
for construction of a national high-speed and intercity rail
network, Vice President  Joe Biden  said.  “There are key places where we cannot afford to sacrifice
as a nation -- one of which is infrastructure,” Biden said in a
speech today at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia. Obama
submits his fiscal 2012 budget to Congress on Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
