  Robert Bosch GmbH , the world’s
biggest automotive supplier, settled a U.K. lawsuit accusing  SGL
Carbon SE  of overcharging for graphite products during a price-
fixing cartel uncovered more than a decade ago.  Terms of the accord are private and neither company was
ordered to pay the other’s costs in the case, Justice Gerald Barling wrote yesterday in a  notice  on the website of the
 Competition Appeal Tribunal  in London.  Stuttgart-based Robert Bosch’s settlement doesn’t involve
the other customers or cartel participants in the four-year-old
lawsuit by  Valeo SA , France’s second-largest car-parts maker and
St. Louis-based  Emerson Electric Co . The other defendants in the
case include Morgan Crucible Co. and Schunk GmbH.  The companies sued after the European Union in 2003 fined
Wiesbaden, Germany-based SGL and other cartel members a total of
101 million euros ($137 million) for fixing prices on graphite
products from 1988 to 1999. While Morgan Crucible received
immunity from the fines because it was the first to cooperate,
its former Chief Executive Officer Ian Norris was sentenced to
18 months in prison in a U.S. case over his role in the cartel.  Robert Bosch spokesman Achim Schneider and SGL spokeswoman
Corinna Gemein declined to immediately comment when reached
today by phone.  In a related case, the cartel members were sued in  London 
in December by Deutsche Bahn AG and other rail companies in
Britain, Germany and Italy, seeking to recover overpayments for
carbon and graphite products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
