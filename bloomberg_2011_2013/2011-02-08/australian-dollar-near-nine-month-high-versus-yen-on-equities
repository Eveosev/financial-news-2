The  New Zealand  dollar fell against
most of its major counterparts after Finance Minister Bill English told parliament it was “possible” the nation’s economy
slipped into recession in the second half of last year.  The Australian dollar earlier traded close to this year’s
high before a report tomorrow that is forecast to show  Australia 
had its longest stretch of jobs growth since 2007. The currency
dropped as stocks slumped.  “English’s comments continue a tried and tested tradition
of kiwi leaders trying to talk the New Zealand dollar down,”
said  Adrian Foster , Hong Kong-based head of financial-market
research for  Asia  at Rabobank Groep NV.  New Zealand’s dollar fell 0.4 percent to 77.17 U.S. cents
at 12:13 p.m. in  New York , from 77.51 yesterday. It weakened 0.4
percent to 63.56 yen.  Australia’s currency dropped 0.4 percent to $1.0102 from
$1.0146 yesterday and $1.0228 on Jan. 3. It bought 83.23 yen
from 83.57 yesterday, when it reached 83.73, the most since May
13.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent.  New Zealand’s currency fell after English said that the
nation’s recovery is going to have some challenges. The economy
may have contracted in the fourth quarter of 2010, entering its
second recession in two years, he said.  Gross domestic product in New Zealand shrank 0.2 percent in
the three months through Sept. 30, and a report last week
showing a decline in fourth-quarter employment added to evidence
of a second-straight quarterly contraction.  Australian employers added 17,500 jobs in January, an 11th-
straight month of gains, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before the statistics bureau reports the data
tomorrow. The  unemployment rate  was unchanged at 5 percent, the
lowest since January 2009, the survey shows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
