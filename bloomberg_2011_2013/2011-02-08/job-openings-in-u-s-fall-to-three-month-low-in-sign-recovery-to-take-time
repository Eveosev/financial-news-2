Job openings in the U.S. decreased in
December to the lowest level in three months, signaling a
sustained labor-market recovery will take time to develop.  The number of positions waiting to be filled fell by
139,000 to 3.06 million, the fewest since September, the Labor
Department said today in  Washington . The number of people hired
also dropped, as did the number of workers fired.  Employers added a fewer-than-forecast 36,000 jobs in
January while the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 9
percent, the lowest level since April 2009, the Labor Department
reported last week. Growth in the world’s largest economy will
need to accelerate to make up for the almost 9 million jobs lost
in the recent recession.  “We have weak labor demand on one side and weak hiring
activity on the other,” said Henry Mo, an economist at Credit
Suisse in  New York . “The pace of recovery is very slow, and at
the current pace we need three or four years to merely get back
to where we were” before the recession.  Stocks rose as weekly retail sales rebounded, offsetting
concern over rising interest rates in  China . The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4 percent to 1,324.57 at the 4 p.m.
close in New York, the highest level since June 2008.  Job openings decreased 4.3 percent in December, the biggest
drop since May, from a revised 3.2 million in the prior month,
the Labor Department report showed.  Biggest Decrease  The decline was led by a 100,000 drop among professional
and business services, which include accountants, computer
systems experts and temporary-help agencies. Construction firms
followed with 63,000 fewer openings in December.  Government agencies showed the biggest increase in help
wanted, which climbed by 114,000.  Compared with the 14.5 million Americans who were
unemployed in December, today’s figures indicate there were 4.7
people vying for every opening, up from about 1.8 when the
recession began in December 2007. The number of jobless fell to
13.9 million last month, pushing the  unemployment rate  down, the
Labor Department reported Feb. 4.  Today’s report helps shed light on the dynamics behind the
monthly employment figures. Private payrolls, which exclude
government positions, rose by 50,000 workers in January, the
Labor Department figures showed last week.  Hiring, Firing  Employers took on 4.18 million workers in December, down
30,000 from the previous month, according to today’s report.
Total firings, which exclude retirements and those who left
their jobs voluntarily, decreased to 1.84 million from 1.85
million a month before.  An increase in the number of people voluntarily leaving
jobs may be one sign Americans feel more confident about finding
other work. About 1.99 million people quit their jobs in
December, representing 48 percent of all separations. That was
up from 1.75 million, or 42 percent, in December 2009.  In the 12 months ended in December, the economy created a
net 900,000 jobs, representing about 51 million hires compared
with about 50.1 million separations, today’s report showed.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  on Feb. 3 said the
U.S. needs to see faster job growth for a sufficient time before
policy makers can be assured the economic recovery has taken
hold.  Bernanke’s View  “With output growth likely to be moderate for a while and
with employers reportedly still reluctant to add to their
payrolls, it will be several years before the unemployment rate
has returned to a more normal level,” Bernanke said in a speech
at the  National Press Club  in Washington. “Until we see a
sustained period of stronger  job creation , we cannot consider
the recovery to be truly established.”  Fed policy makers have signaled they will stick to their
plan to keep buying as much as $600 billion in debt through June
to spur growth.  Lowe’s Cos., the second-biggest U.S. home-improvement
retailer, plans to add 8,000 to 10,000 weekend sales positions
to improve staffing at the busiest time of the week. The
Mooresville, North Carolina-based chain also will cut 1,700
middle-management jobs as profit growth trails that of larger
rival Home Depot Inc.  The two largest U.S. automakers are expanding. Ford Motor
Corp., based in Dearborn, Michigan, plans to hire more than
7,000 workers in the next two years. Larger rival General Motors
Co., based in  Detroit , will add a third shift and about 750 jobs
to its assembly plant in Flint,  Michigan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
