  Hong Kong  Exchanges & Clearing Ltd.,
the world’s biggest listed stock exchange by market value, is in
the process of upgrading its securities market trading system.  The new system will initially boost its capacity 10-fold to
30,000 orders per second, and can be further increased to
150,000 orders per second, according to a government statement.  The upgrade will also cut the average order processing
latency to 9 milliseconds from 150 milliseconds, the statement
said. Hong Kong Exchanges’ Chief Executive Charles Li said in
May the bourse would roll out a new trading system by the end of
2011.  Exchanges worldwide are competing to improve high-frequency
trading settings. The Tokyo Stock Exchange has introduced its
Arrowhead system that processes orders in 2 milliseconds
compared with 2 to 3 seconds previously.  Australia ’s ASX Ltd.’s
Genium INET platform, launched last year, cut the average trade
time to 250 microseconds from three milliseconds. A microsecond
is a millionth of a second.    Singapore Exchange  plans to start using the world’s fastest
system, SGX Reach, on Aug. 15, according to a statement dated
Jan. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
