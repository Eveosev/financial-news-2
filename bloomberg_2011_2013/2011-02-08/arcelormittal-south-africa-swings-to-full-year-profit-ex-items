  ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd ., the
steelmaker that reported a fourth-quarter loss today, said it
expects a “significant” turnaround in earnings as demand and
prices advance.    ArcelorMittal   South Africa , the continent’s biggest
steelmaker, posted a loss excluding one-time items of 495
million rand ($68.5 million), compared with a profit of 469
million rand a year earlier. The company returned to profit over
the full year, it said today in a statement.  “A significant turnaround in earnings is anticipated for
the first quarter 2011 compared to the loss for the last quarter
of 2010,” the steelmaker said, citing higher demand for the
alloy and rising prices. “This will be partially offset by an
increase in some raw-material prices, mainly scrap.”  Net income was 1.35 billion rand in 2010, compared with a
loss of 478 million rand a year earlier, the Vanderbijlpark-
based company said in the statement. Sales rose 18 percent to
30.2 billion rand.  South African steel demand rose over the year after the
country emerged from its first recession in 17 years, boosting
spending on cars and appliances. Benchmark hot-rolled coil
prices climbed 27 percent to an average $670.55 a metric ton as
the global financial crisis eased.  Iron Ore Costs  A stronger rand made some imported materials cheaper last
year, reducing the cash cost of steel sales by 2.5 percent,
according to the statement. Cost gains were countered by higher
iron-ore prices after a supply agreement with  Kumba Iron Ore
Ltd . was scrapped. The change in contract terms is the subject
of arbitration.  ArcelorMittal South Africa fell for a third day, declining
61 cents, or 0.7 percent, to 84.74 rand as of 9:22 a.m. in
Johannesburg, valuing the company at almost 38 billion rand.  Full-year earnings excluding one-time items were 3.43 rand
a share, missing the 4.45-rand median estimate of eight analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, is the
largest shareholder in the South African company.
