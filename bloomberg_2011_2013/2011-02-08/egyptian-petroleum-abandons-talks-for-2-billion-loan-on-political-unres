Egyptian General Petroleum Corp., the
state oil company known as EGPC, abandoned talks with banks for
a $2 billion loan amid anti-government protests, according to
three bankers with direct knowledge of the deal.  Negotiations are on hold until calm has returned to the
region, said the people, who didn’t want to be identified
because the transaction is private. When the company renews
talks, potential loan arrangers will need to submit new
proposals and terms, the people said.  EGPC’s Chief Executive Officer Abdalla Ghorab didn’t
immediately respond to three phone calls seeking comment. The
Cairo-based company initially asked banks to submit bids for the
five-year pre-export financing deal by Jan. 17, a week before
the crisis erupted.  “Banks will be adopting a cautious stance towards Egyptian
deals until there is more clarity on the political situation,”
said John Starling, a director for HSBC Holdings Plc’s loan
syndicate in  London .  Protests in the Egyptian capital to topple the 30-year
regime of  Hosni Mubarak  continued today as the government vows
progress within a month toward free elections and opposition
leaders negotiate with Vice President  Omar Suleiman .  To contact the reporter on this story:
