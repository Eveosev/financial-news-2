European Ryder Cup captain Jose Maria Olazabal will use only two wild-card picks in selecting his team
for next year’s golf event.  Olazabal asked the  European Tour  for a change back to the
selection process used from 1995 to 2009 as he attempts to
retain the Ryder Cup in the U.S.  Colin Montgomerie  requested
three wild-card, or captain’s, picks for last year’s event.  “I looked over the last few qualification processes, going
back to 2004, and was satisfied that my proposal would give me
the strongest team on paper,” Olazabal, who was named captain
Jan. 18, said in a  statement .  The qualifying system will also change, with the five
leading players on the European Tour points list automatically
making the 12-man team. That will be followed by the top five on
the world ranking list, a reversal of the system Montgomerie
used last year. Olazabal will then choose the final two team
members.  The U.S. team is decided with the top eight players
determined by a points system compiled by the PGA of America.
Captain  Davis Love III  will then make four wild-card picks.  The  2012 Ryder Cup  will be played at Medinah Country Club
in  Chicago  from Sept. 28-30.  Europe  won the event 14 1/2 to 13
1/2 at Celtic Manor, Wales, in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
