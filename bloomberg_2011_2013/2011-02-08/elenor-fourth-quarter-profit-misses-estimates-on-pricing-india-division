  Telenor ASA , the Nordic region’s
largest phone company, reported fourth-quarter profit that
missed analysts’ estimates as some mobile-service pricing fell
and spent money on its Indian division.  Net income declined to 2.1 billion kroner ($365 million)
from 2.17 billion kroner a year earlier, Fornebu, Norway-based
Telenor said today in a  statement . Sales rose 11 percent to 24.9
billion kroner. Analysts had predicted profit of 2.56 billion
kroner on sales of 24.3 billion kroner.  Lower roaming service charges pared mobile revenue in  Norway . Telenor also stepped up marketing in Sweden and  Denmark 
as competition increased. Asian revenue rose 13 percent in
established operations, and Telenor reported a gain of 1.3
billion kroner from its holdings in VimpelCom Ltd. The Norwegian
company said it forecasts revenue growth exceeding 5 percent
this year, excluding acquisitions or disposals.  “Going forward, we expect significant long-term effects
from the ongoing investments in network modernizations,” Chief
Executive Officer Jon Fredrik Baksaas said in the statement.  Telenor proposed a dividend of 3.80 kroner per share.  The Uninor division in  India , in which Telenor reached a
majority stake last year, reported a fourth-quarter operating
loss of 1.27 billion kroner. Subscriptions in the quarter rose
by 4.3 million for a total 12.3 million at the end the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
