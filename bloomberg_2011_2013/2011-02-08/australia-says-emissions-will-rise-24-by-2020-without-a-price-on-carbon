  Australia ’s carbon emissions are
expected to climb 24 percent between 2000 and 2020 without an
initiative to make companies pay for burning fossil fuels such
as coal, the government estimated.  Emissions are projected to grow by 1.8 percent a year
between 2010 and 2020 amid a rise in coal and liquefied natural
gas exports, according to  a report  released today by the
Australian Climate Change Department. That compares with average
annual growth of 0.4 percent in the prior decade.  Australia, the world’s biggest exporter of coal, needs to
impose a price on greenhouse gas emissions after setting a
target of generating 20 percent of its power from renewable
energy by 2020, Climate Change Minister  Greg Combet  said.  “More needs to be done, and that’s why we need a carbon
price, soon,” Combet said in an e-mailed statement. “Without a
carbon price underpinning long-term investments in renewable
energy, low emissions gas generation and energy efficiency, the
report anticipates that new coal-fired generators will continue
to be built, and there is a risk of falling short of the
government’s target.”  The government is committed to at least a 5 percent cut in
emissions by 2020 compared with 2000 levels, the report shows.
Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  has said lawmakers must
decide this year on a way to introduce a carbon price.  Emissions from coal mines and oil and gas projects,
including LNG ventures, are expected to make up almost half of
the forecast growth in emissions during the next decade,
according to the government report.  To contact the reporter on this story:  James Paton  in Sydney   jpaton4@bloomberg.net .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
