  Kindred Healthcare Inc  is to acquire  RehabCare Group Inc . for about $900 million in stock and cash,
the Wall Street Journal reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  The deal, which is expected to be announced later today,
will give RehabCare investors $35 a share, with $26 of that in
cash and the rest in Kindred stock, a 37.4 percent premium to
Mondayâ€™s closing share price, the newspaper said.  Kindred is getting financing from JPMorgan Chase, Morgan
Stanley and Citigroup Inc., and will assume $400 million in
RehabCare debt, the WSJ said.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
