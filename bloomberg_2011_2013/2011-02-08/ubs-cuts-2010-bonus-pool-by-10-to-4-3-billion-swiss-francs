  UBS AG , Switzerland’s biggest lender,
cut its 2010 bonus pool by 10 percent as fourth-quarter
investment-banking profit slumped.  The bonus pool, including pay that is being deferred into
future years, amounts to 4.3 billion Swiss francs ($4.5
billion), down from 4.8 billion francs for 2009, the Zurich-
based bank said today. UBS’s investment-banking profit fell 75
percent in the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period
following a loss in the third quarter of 2010.  “We’re responding to the fact that although we do have a
profit this year, toward the end of the year the performance in
some of our divisions fell short of our ambitions,” UBS Chief
Financial Officer John Cryan told reporters on a call today.  UBS follows  Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. in cutting 2010 compensation for traders, investment bankers
and other employees due to a drop in revenue and increased
regulatory pressures. UBS has revamped its compensation system
by increasing fixed salaries as a proportion of the total,
deferring some pay and introducing claw-back provisions.  Goldman Sachs’s compensation and benefits expense fell 5
percent to $15.4 billion in 2010 as the firm’s revenue dropped
13 percent and the number of employees rose. JPMorgan’s
investment bank cut average pay for employees 2.4 percent to
$369,651 last year, the bank said last month. Deutsche Bank AG
boosted average compensation per worker at its corporate and
investment bank by 4.5 percent in 2010 as income at the unit
climbed. The bank reserved enough to pay an average 372,765
euros ($507,370) to each employee at the division.  ‘Right Balance’  Chief Executive Officer Oswald Gruebel told investors in
November that UBS has to pay “competitively” to retain key
staff as the bank tries to strike “the right balance” between
capital building, dividend payments and employee remuneration.  UBS’s investment bank had earnings of 75 million francs in
the last three months of the year on low client activity and
higher costs. The unit had a pretax profit of 2.17 billion
francs for 2010, about a third of UBS’s mid-term goal of 6
billion francs.  Each employee with total compensation above 250,000 francs
will receive at least 60 percent of the bonus in shares deferred
over three years, while members of the executive board will have
more than 75 percent of their variable compensation deferred,
the bank said. Awards are also subject to claw-back provisions.  Bonus Plans  The bank is booking 2.69 billion francs in costs related to
bonuses in 2010, with the rest deferred into future years,
compared with 2.9 billion francs booked in 2009, Cryan said.  UBS told employees last week that they’ll be informed about
their individual 2010 bonuses on Feb. 16, a week later than
originally planned. Bonuses will be paid in the first days of
March to employees in the U.S. and in mid-March in  Switzerland ,
while bankers in the U.K. will receive them at the end of this
month, spokeswoman Eveline Mueller-Eichenberger said.  The delay was needed “in light of the reviews we still
have to do, the need to ensure all checks are completed
consistent with regulatory requirements and to ensure high
quality execution of the payment process,” the bank’s human
resources department told staff in a memo last week. UBS
confirmed the contents of the memo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
