Cricket  Australia  ordered independent
reviews of the governance of the sport in the country and
national team performance following the 3-1 Ashes loss to
England last month.  The Melbourne-based governing body said today the two
separate reviews would begin later this month and wants them
completed by its annual general meeting in October.  “We will confirm the names of review participants once the
scoping has been agreed and before they start discussions with
the wide range of stakeholders involved in the respective
issues,” Cricket Australia Chairman Jack Clarke said in an e-
mailed statement.  The move mirrors that made by the England and Wales Cricket
Board in 2007 after England lost an Ashes series 5-0 for the
first time in 86 years. While it’s not yet known who will
conduct the review into team performance, former Australian
Football League commissioner Colin Carter and David Crawford,
who led a government-funded inquiry into soccer in Australia in
2002, will assist with the governance review, Clarke said.  Australia’s 3-1 Ashes defeat was its first home loss to  England  for 24 years and worst series reverse since 1988-89. The
touring team only had to bat once in Adelaide, Melbourne and
Sydney as Australia lost three matches in a series by more than
an innings for the first time in 134 years of Test cricket.  “The reviews will get underway once the terms of
reference, scope and timelines have been finalized by the
independent consultants to be engaged by the board,” Clarke
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
