  South Africa  won’t lift a moratorium
on new prospecting rights in the Mpumalanga province when it
ends the ban at the end of March for the nation’s eight other
provinces, the South African Press Association said, citing
Mineral Resources Minister Susan Shabangu.  Some applications were granted in ecologically sensitive
areas of the province and these need to be addressed first, the
Johannesburg-based news service said. It may take another three
months before the moratorium over Mpumalanga applications will
be lifted, the minister was quoted as saying to reporters at the
Mining Indaba in  Cape Town  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
