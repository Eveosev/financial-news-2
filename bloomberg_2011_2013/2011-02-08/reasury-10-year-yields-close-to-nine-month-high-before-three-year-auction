Treasuries fell, with three-year
notes declining for a seventh straight day, as the U.S. prepared
to sell $32 billion of the securities in the first of three note
and bond auctions this week totaling $72 billion.  The difference in yield between 2- and 30-year Treasuries
narrowed for a second day as the  Federal Reserve  bought $2.2
billion in Treasuries maturing between August 2028 and November
2040 as part of its plan to bolster the economy. A measure of
small business confidence rose, adding to evidence the economy
is accelerating. Treasury will auction $24 billion of 10-year
debt tomorrow and $16 billion of 30-year bonds on Feb. 10.  “The climb higher in yield in the rates market over the
last few days should help bring demand to the market for the
three-year auction,” said Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York
at Tradition Asiel Securities Inc., an interdealer broker. “The
demand for longer-end auctions are more in question at these
levels, and we are still seeing some concession.”  Three-year note yields rose five basis points to 1.29
percent at 11:30 a.m. in  New York . The seventh-straight increase
in yield was the longest streak since December 2009. The price
of the 1 percent security maturing in January 2014 fell 4/32, or
$1.25 per $1,000 face value, to 99 5/32.  Yield Pattern  Ten-year yields rose three basis points to 3.66 percent,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The rate climbed to 3.69
percent yesterday, the highest since May 4. Ten-year yields have
risen from a low of 2.33 percent last year, set on Oct. 8, on
signs of growth in the U.S., including a drop in the  unemployment rate  to a 21-month low in January.  The 2-year to 30-year yield curve narrowed three basis
points to 3.91 percentage points after the spread hit a record
high of 4.02 percent on Feb. 1. The 2-year yield reached 0.79
percent, the most since June.  Treasuries have handed investors a loss of 1.2 percent this
year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lunch indexes,
underperforming the 4.8 percent rise in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  An index of confidence among U.S. small businesses rose to
94 in January; the most since 2007, from December’s 92.6, the
Washington-based  National Federation of Independent Business  is
forecast to say today, according to 12 economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  ‘Economic Picture’  “The economic picture is driving the price action as we’ve
seen same improvement over a wide swath of the globe that is
helping to push yields higher,” said Christian Cooper, head of
U.S. dollar derivatives trading in New York at Jefferies & Co.,
one of the 20 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “The
market is more sure of itself around supply and the Fed
purchases. The question going forward is whether we will begin
to import inflation, and if the Fed will be able to get ahead of
it.”  The 10-year yield will advance to 3.81 percent by year-
end, according to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities
companies with the most recent forecasts given the heaviest
weightings.  The  University of Michigan  consumer sentiment index rose to
75 this month from 74.2 in January, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey before the report
Feb. 11. U.S. data a day earlier will show applications for
jobless benefits declined, another survey showed.  Pre-Auction Trading  The three-year notes scheduled for sale today yielded 1.35
percent in pre-auction trading, compared with 1.027 percent at
the previous sale of the securities on Jan. 11.  Investors bid for 3.06 times the amount of debt offered
last month. The average for the past 10 auctions is 3.15.
Indirect bidders, which include foreign central banks, bought
39.4 percent of the securities, versus the 10-sale average of
41.3 percent.  “Weak auctions at these levels would be a strongly bearish
sign for Treasuries, and we will be monitoring the price action
closely,”  George Goncalves , head of interest-rate strategy at
Nomura Holdings Inc., a primary dealer,  wrote in a note to
clients. “Auctions at these higher yield levels should begin to
draw out some sidelined cash.”  The Fed plans to buy $6 billion to $8 billion of Treasuries
maturing between February 2015 and July 2016 tomorrow as part of
its $600 billion plan to buy Treasuries to boost the economy.  Fed Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said the
quickening U.S. recovery means policy makers need to take
“quite seriously” their commitment to review the $600 billion
monetary-stimulus program.  “The distinct improvement in the economic outlook since
the program was initiated suggests taking that re-evaluation
quite seriously,” Lacker said today in a speech in  Newark ,  Delaware . “That re-evaluation will be challenging, because
inflation is capable of accelerating, even if the level of
economic activity has not yet returned to pre-recession trend,”
he said.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Feb. 3 that he needs
to see “a sustained period of stronger  job creation ” before
deeming the recovery firmly established. Bernanke testifies
tomorrow before the House Budget Committee.  To contact the reporters on this story:
