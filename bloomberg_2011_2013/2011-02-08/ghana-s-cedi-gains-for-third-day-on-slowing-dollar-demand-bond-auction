  Ghana ’s cedi appreciated for the
third day versus the  U.S. dollar  as demand for the foreign
currency by importers subsided and banks sought cedis before a
Feb. 16 bond auction.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
strengthened 1.5 percent to 1.5175 per dollar at 1:03 p.m. in
Accra, from a close of 1.5405 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Requests for dollars by importers of “petroleum, vehicles
and consumables has reduced,” Kwabena Owusu, a currency trader
in the Accra office of  Access Bank Plc , said in a phone
interview.  Higher demand for the cedi before the Bank of Ghana’s
scheduled auction of three-year bonds also aided the currency’s
gain, he added. It strengthened 3.5 percent against the dollar
since Feb. 4, when the central bank announced the date of the
bond auction. It weakened 5.2 percent of its value in January,
its biggest monthly drop since June 2008, on uncertainty over
when the sale would take place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
