Oil in New York rose from the lowest
in eight days on signs of demand increases after an industry-
funded report showed crude stockpiles dropped for the first time
in five weeks in the U.S.  Futures advanced as much as 0.8 percent after the American
Petroleum Institute said yesterday inventories fell 558,000
barrels to 346 million barrels last week. A U.S. Energy
Department report today may  show supplies  in the world’s biggest
consumer of the commodity climbed 2 million barrels, according
to a Bloomberg News survey.  “The market will closely watch the official U.S. EIA oil
inventory data,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity research at
Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne, said in
a note today. The industry report showed a “surprise” decline
as imports fell and refinery use climbed, he said.  The March contract gained as much as 69 cents to $87.63 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
and was at $87.40 at 4:02 p.m. Singapore time. Yesterday, it
lost 54 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $86.94, the lowest close since
Jan. 27. Prices are 19 percent higher than a year ago.  Brent crude for March settlement rose as much as 64 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $100.56 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London. Prices exceeded $100 for an eighth
consecutive day.  London Brent’s premium to West Texas Intermediate, the
crude grade traded in New York, narrowed today to $12.89 a
barrel as WTI’s gains outpaced the European benchmark. The price
difference yesterday reached a record $12.98, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The gap averaged 76 cents last year.  API Inventories  U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 1.5 million barrels in the
Gulf Coast region, according to the API data yesterday. Supplies
in the Petroleum Administration for Defense District 2,
consisting of the Midwest states, dropped by 1.3 million.
Inventories at the  Cushing , Oklahoma, delivery point for New
York oil futures declined from a record, dropping 927,000 to
37.5 million.  “The API report was encouraging,”  Stephen Schork ,
President of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova, Pennsylvania,
said in a report today. “The only significant build in crude
inventories was on the West Coast which, due to its geographical
disparity, is often overlooked by the markets. All told this was
the most bullish report the API has released in weeks, but will
the DOE corroborate?”  Crude imports dropped 11 percent last week to 8.6 million
barrels, the API data showed.  Energy Department  Gasoline supplies gained 3.2 million barrels to 239.7
million barrels, the API said.  Motor fuel inventories  probably
increased 2.6 million barrels from 236.2 million a week earlier,
according to the median of 16 analyst estimates before the
government report today. The projected advance would leave
stockpiles at the highest level since Feb. 26, 1993.  Distillate fuel levels, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, dropped 538,000 barrels to 160.7 million, the
industry group reported.  Supplies  probably slipped 1 million
barrels, or 0.6 percent, from 164.1 million, the inventory
survey showed.  Tens of thousands of Egyptians filled Cairo’s Tahrir Square
yesterday as Vice President  Omar Suleiman  sought to convince
demonstrators that the government is serious about moving toward
democracy while stabilizing the economy.  Crude prices in New York surged 7 percent in the five days
after protests against the government of Egyptian President
 Hosni Mubarak  raised concerns that oil flows through the country
might be disrupted.  To contact the reporters on this story:
