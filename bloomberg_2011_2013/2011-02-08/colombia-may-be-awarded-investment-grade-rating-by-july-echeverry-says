Ratings firms may upgrade  Colombia 
to investment grade in the first half of this year, though the
exact timing depends on the companies, Finance Minister Juan
Carlos Echeverry said on a conference call with investors.    Standard & Poor’s  in July raised its outlook on Colombia’s
foreign debt to positive, followed by Moody’s Investors Service
in September. S&P, Moody’s and  Fitch Ratings  all rate the
securities one level below investment grade.  Colombia may be the next Latin American country to be
raised to investment grade, Joydeep Mukherji, senior director of
Latin American sovereign ratings for S&P, said in a conference
call on Jan. 11.  Colombia lost its investment grade rating with Moody’s
Investors Service 11 years ago when insurgent violence and a
banking crisis helped trigger six straight quarters of
contraction in 1998 and 1999. S&P also cut Colombia below
investment grade in 1999.  Colombia’s peso fell 0.01 percent to 1,869.15 per  U.S.
dollar  at 9:18 a.m. New York time, from 1,868.90 yesterday. The
yield on Colombia’s benchmark 11 percent bonds due July 2020
rose 0.27 percentage point to 8.092 percent, according to
Colombia’s stock exchange.  The central government’s budget deficit last year was 3.9
percent of gross domestic product and the consolidated budget
deficit was 3 percent, according to preliminary  figures ,
Echeverry said.  The ministry had earlier projected a deficit of 4.3 percent
for the central government and 3.6 percent for the consolidated
budget deficit.  The government maintained its projection for the 2011
central government deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP, though
Echeverry said the deficit may come below 4 percent this year.
The consolidated  budget deficit  estimate was widened for this
year to 3.5 percent from an earlier estimate of 3.2 percent,
Echeverry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
