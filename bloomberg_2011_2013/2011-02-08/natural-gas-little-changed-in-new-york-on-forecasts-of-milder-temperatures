Natural gas futures declined to the
lowest price in almost 12 weeks on forecasts of moderating
temperatures that may limit demand for the heating fuel.  Gas slipped for a fourth day in  New York  as National
Weather Service forecasts showed that warmer-than-normal weather
is likely in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and South from Feb. 13
through Feb. 17. The Energy Department today raised its forecast
for 2011 gas production by 1.5 percent.  “The market has had spring on its mind for several weeks
now,” said Jay Levine, the president of Enerjay LLC, an energy
brokerage in  Portland ,  Maine . “In this case, the price is
signaling that the market has little or no fear of future supply
versus demand.”  Natural gas for March delivery fell 6.4 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $4.04 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Nov.
18. The futures have declined 25 percent from a year ago.  The low temperature in New York on Feb. 15 may be 40
degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius), 12 degrees above normal,
according to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.
The low in  Chicago  may be 31 degrees, 10 degrees above normal.  “We do have some moderating temperatures later this
month,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst with Tradition Energy
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Weak fundamentals have kept gas
prices below $5 this winter for the first time in nine years.”  U.S. heating demand may be 22 percent below normal levels
from Feb. 14 through Feb. 18, according to Weather Derivatives
in Belton, Missouri.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  Milder Weather  “The temperature outlook suggests the worst is behind us
in terms of cold this heating season, though winter weather to
date has sure been supportive,” Canaccord Genuity analysts
including  Cameron Horwitz  in Houston said in a note to clients
today.  Energy Department data scheduled for release Feb. 10 may
show a larger-than-normal withdrawal from gas  inventories  for
the week ended Feb. 4, analysts predicted. The department may
report a reduction in stockpiles of 192 billion cubic feet,
according to the median of 11 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  The five-year average withdrawal for the week is 159
billion, according to department data. A decline of more than
164 billion cubic feet would erase a 0.2 percent surplus to the
five-year average.  Higher Production  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas production in
2011 and increased its outlook for this year’s  gas prices , the
department’s monthly  Short-Term Energy Outlook  showed. Marketed
gas production will average 62.32 billion cubic feet a day in
2011, up from 61.38 billion estimated in January, the department
said.  Gas prices at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana,
will average $4.16 per million British thermal units, up 3.5
percent from January’s estimate of $4.02, according to the
report from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  “Increasing consumption, especially in the electric power
sector, contributes to higher prices and more economic incentive
for producers to resume drilling,” the EIA said in the report.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
403,325 as of 2:40 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 295,000. Volume reached a record 510,442 yesterday, according
to Chris Grams, a spokesman for CME Group Inc., which owns the
Nymex. Open interest was 883,157 contracts. The three-month
average open interest is 796,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
