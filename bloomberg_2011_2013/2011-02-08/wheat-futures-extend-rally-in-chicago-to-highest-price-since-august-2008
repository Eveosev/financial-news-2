Wheat futures rose to a 29-month high
on signs that countries are boosting grain inventories after
food inflation spurred unrest in North Africa.    Egypt , the world’s biggest importer, bought 55,000 metric
tons from the U.S. in a tender on Feb. 5. Iraq, Turkey,
Bangladesh and Algeria have issued tenders since Feb. 6, and
Iran and  Saudi Arabia  may be in the market “soon,” the CME
Group Inc. said in a report on its website.  “We had all these tenders that showed up over the
weekend,” said  Jeff McReynolds , the owner of McReynolds
Marketing and Investments in Hays, Kansas. “It still shows a
lot of demand showing up in the world market, and it hit all at
once.”  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 15.5 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $8.745 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $8.8075, the highest for a
most-active contract since Aug. 25, 2008.  Prices surged 81 percent in the past year as drought
slashed supplies in Russia and floods eroded crops from Canada
to  Australia . Tens of thousands of Egyptian protesters have
rallied in the streets, chanting that the government is
“illegitimate” as surging food costs and high unemployment
sparked unrest.  Wheat was the fourth most-valuable U.S. crop in 2009 at
$10.6 billion, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
