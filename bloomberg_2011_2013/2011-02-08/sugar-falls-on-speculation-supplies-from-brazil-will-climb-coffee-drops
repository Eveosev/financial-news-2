Sugar futures fell as rising output
in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer, and prospects for
slowing demand in  China  eased concern for tight global
inventories. Orange juice and coffee also declined.  China raised interest rates today for the third time since
mid-October to curb inflation that is accelerating as the
economy expands. Raw-sugar prices that touched a 30-year high
last week probably will drop this year as Brazil boosts output,
Lindsay Jolly, a senior economist at the  International Sugar
Organization , said Feb. 1.  “Brazil is going to have a record crop,” said  Shawn Hackett , the president of Hackett Financial Advisors in Boynton
Beach, Florida. “There is simply not going to be a scarcity of
sugar.”  Raw sugar for March delivery dropped 1.2 cents, or 3.7
percent, to 31.48 cents a pound at 10:59 a.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . Before today, prices jumped 25 percent in the
past year, touching 36.08 cents on Feb. 2, as adverse weather in
Brazil, India and Australia damaged crops.  Brazil produced 39.4 million tons of sugar in the season
that ran from April to November, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.  In London, refined-sugar for May delivery dropped $24.90,
or 3.2 percent, to $753.90 a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  China raised its key interest rates before a report that is
forecast to show inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in 30
months.  “Any time you tighten monetary policy, you’re slowing down
economic growth, and the demand from China will slow down,”
Hackett said.    Orange-juice  futures for March delivery fell 1.9 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $1.706 a pound on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery declined 0.55
cent, or 0.2 percent, to $2.4902 a pound on ICE. In London,
robusta-coffee futures for March delivery fell $13, or 0.6
percent, to $2,202 a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
