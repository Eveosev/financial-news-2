OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, Russia’s
largest mining company, is looking for potential platinum group
metal investments in  South Africa  and projects in Indonesia as
the company seeks to diversify outside of its home country.  “We’re quite optimistic about business development in
South Africa,” Roman Panov, head of international operations,
said in an interview in Cape Town today. Norilsk is also seeking
opportunities in Indonesia to diversify geographically, he said.  Norilsk operates in Russia, Australia, Finland and Botswana
and produces nickel in a venture with  African Rainbow Minerals
Ltd . in South Africa, the largest platinum manufacturing nation.
Platinum, used in jewelry and to curb pollution, is typically
associated with metals including palladium and rhodium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
