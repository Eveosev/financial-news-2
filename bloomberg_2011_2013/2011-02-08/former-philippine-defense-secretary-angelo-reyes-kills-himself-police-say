Former Philippine Defense Secretary
Angelo Reyes, under congressional investigation for allegedly
taking more than $1 million from the military for his personal
use, shot himself to death in  Manila , police said.  Reyes, 65, shot himself in the chest after visiting his
motherâ€™s grave this morning, Eastern Police District Director
Francisco Manalo said by phone. Reyes died 45 minutes after he
was rushed to a Manila hospital, Health Secretary Enrique Ona
said in a televised press briefing.  Former military budget officer George Rabusa last month in
a congressional hearing accused officials including Reyes of
authorizing no-bid equipment purchases and accepting at least 50
million pesos ($1.1 million) each in retirement money. Reyes
denied the charges.  As chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,
Reyes in 2001 deserted former President  Joseph Estrada  and
joined a peaceful mass uprising that ousted the former president
and installed  Gloria Arroyo . He was defense secretary from 2001
to 2003, and later became secretary of the departments of
environment and energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
