Gold may gain for the first time in
three days in New York on speculation demand will increase as
China returns from holiday and as the dollar’s rally stalls.  China’s markets are due to reopen tomorrow after the Lunar
New Year. The People’s Bank of China raised  interest rates  for
the third time since October after growth accelerated and
inflation stayed above 4 percent for a third month. The dollar
declined against the euro before a report forecast to show U.S.
consumer confidence improved. Gold typically moves inversely to
the dollar.  “The first reaction was a bit of profit taking” after the
China rate announcement, said Narayan Gopalakrishnan, a Geneva-
based trader at bullion refiner MKS Finance SA. “With the
Chinese New Year almost over, more guys may be coming in to
buy.”  Gold futures for April delivery added $2.50, or 0.2
percent, to $1,350.70 an ounce at 8:11 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal for immediate delivery in  London  was 0.1 percent
lower at $1,350.28.  Bullion rose to $1,354 an ounce in the morning “fixing”
in London, used by some mining companies to sell output, from
$1,347.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Gold prices “are up slightly this morning as the dollar
declines, encouraging investors back into the market,” Fairfax
IS said today in a report. China is the second-biggest jewelry
user after India, according to GFMS Ltd.  China Rates  The benchmark one-year lending rate will increase to 6.06
percent from 5.81 percent, effective tomorrow, the People’s Bank
of China said on its website today. The one-year deposit rate
will rise to 3 percent from 2.75 percent.  Bullion has declined 5 percent this year as signs the
economic recovery is strengthening curbed demand for a
protection of wealth. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
testifies tomorrow at a hearing of the House Budget Committee.
He said last week that the U.S. needs to see faster employment
growth for a sufficient time before policy makers can be assured
the economic recovery has taken hold.  Pictet & Cie.,  Switzerland ’s biggest closely held private
bank, cut the share of gold in euro-denominated portfolios for
the first time since 2004 on expectations the 17-nation currency
will strengthen. Euro-clients should reduce gold to 6 percent of
their portfolios from 10 percent, Chief Investment Officer Yves Bonzon said in an interview at the Geneva-based money manager.  $2,000 Gold  Bonzon reiterated the bank’s expectation that prices will
climb to $2,000 an ounce by 2015. HSBC Global Asset Management’s
$2.5 billion Absolute Return fund halved its gold holdings to 3
percent in January in the second reduction in three months,
head  Charles Morris  said in an interview from London today.  Bullion held in exchange-traded products dropped 2.12
metric tons to 2,025.42 tons yesterday, the lowest level since
June 8, data compiled by Bloomberg from 10 providers show.
Holdings reached a record 2,114.6 tons in December.  The ratio of gold to silver dropped to near the lowest
level since December 2006. An ounce of gold bought as little as
45.62 ounces of silver in London today. The ratio fell to 45.54
on Jan. 3.  “With the recent bout of economic optimism in the markets,
demand for gold as a hedge against uncertainty is reduced,”
said Ong Yi Ling, Singapore-based investment analyst with
Phillip Futures Pte. “Hence, gains in gold could be capped. On
the other hand, silver may benefit more from the economic
recovery” as industrial use increases.  Silver for March delivery in  New York  was little changed at
$29.36 an ounce. Palladium for March delivery lost 0.2 percent
to $817.75 an ounce, after climbing to $834.50 on Feb. 4, the
highest price since March 2001. Platinum for April delivery was
0.2 percent lower at $1,840 an ounce. It reached $1,863.40 on
Feb. 4, the highest level since July 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
