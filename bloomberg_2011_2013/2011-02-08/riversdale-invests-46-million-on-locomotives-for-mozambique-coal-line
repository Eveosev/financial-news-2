  Riversdale Mining Ltd . will invest
$46 million in locomotives to carry coal from its Benga mine in
Mozambique to Beira port, Anthony Martin, the company’s
executive director for Mozambique, said.  Riversdale, based in Sydney, will buy 11 locomotives and
200 wagons for the rail line, Martin said today in an interview
in the northwestern Tete province. The locomotives and wagons
will probably be delivered in April before the mines starts
exporting coal in September, he said.  The Benga mine is expected to produce 5.3 million metric
tons of brute coal a year by the second half of this year, he
said. Output may rise to 20 million tons of brute coal a year by
2013 of which 10 million tons will be exported, Martin said.  The project, jointly owned by  Tata Steel Ltd .,  India ’s
biggest steel producer, has an estimated coal reserve of 502
million tons., according to Riversdale’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
