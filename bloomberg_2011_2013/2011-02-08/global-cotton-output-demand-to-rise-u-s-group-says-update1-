Global cotton output may climb 5.7
percent in the year starting Aug. 1 as farmers increase planting
after prices surged to a record, said Jordan Lea, the president
of the American Cotton Shippers Association.  Production will rise to 122 million bales, Lea, also the
chairman of Greenville, South Caroline-based Eastern Trading
Co., said today at an industry conference in  Washington . The
crop in the year ending July 31 will be 115.46 million bales,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Jan. 12. Annual
consumption may climb 2.9 percent, Lea said.  Prices have more than doubled in the past year, reaching a
record $1.8122 a pound on Feb. 3, after flooding slashed crops
in Pakistan and Australia and demand surged in  China , the
world’s biggest buyer. Acreage in U.S., the leading exporter,
may rise 14 percent this year, the National Cotton Council said
on Feb. 5.  “The surge in prices was mainly because of adverse weather
conditions, demand from China, government interventions and
global political tensions,” Lea said. “The  hedge funds  and  index funds  have led to temporary speculation in prices.”  Consumption in the year ending July 31 will be 116.58
million bales, the USDA has forecast. A bale of cotton weighs
480 pounds (218 kilograms).  The American Cotton Shippers Association is based in
Memphis, Tennessee.  Cotton for March delivery gained 0.78 cent, or 0.4 percent,
to settle at $1.7529 at 2:51 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
