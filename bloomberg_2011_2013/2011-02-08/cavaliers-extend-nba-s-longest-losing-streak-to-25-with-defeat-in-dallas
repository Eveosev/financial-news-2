The  Cleveland Cavaliers  broke their
own National Basketball Association record for futility,
extending their losing streak to 25 games with a 99-96 defeat
against the  Dallas Mavericks .  The Cavaliers two nights ago surpassed the single-season
record for losses. They also tied the NBA record for consecutive
losses, equaling the franchise’s 24-game skid over two seasons
in 1982 and 1983.  This year’s Cavaliers squad now holds the record alone
after last night’s game in Dallas, where Cleveland lost after
failing to get off a potentially tying 3-point shot before time
expired.  “Just another way to come out on the other end of the
stick,” Cavaliers forward  Antawn Jamison  said in a televised
interview. “We had an opportunity to extend the game there at
the end, but just came up short.”    Cleveland  last year had an NBA-best 61-21 regular-season
record with LeBron James winning a second straight Most Valuable
Player award. Without James, who signed with the Miami Heat as a
free agent in July 2010, the Cavaliers’ 8-44 record this season
is the worst in the league.  Cleveland hasn’t won since Dec. 18 -- a 109-102 overtime
victory against the  New York Knicks  -- and has lost 35 of its
last 36 games overall.  The Cavaliers now play eight straight games at home,
including the next three against teams with losing records in
the Detroit Pistons (19-32), the Los Angeles Clippers (19-31)
and Washington Wizards (13-37). The Wizards are 0-25 on the road
this season and visit Cleveland on Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
