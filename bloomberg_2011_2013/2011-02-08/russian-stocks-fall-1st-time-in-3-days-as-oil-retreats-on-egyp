Russian stocks fell the most in more
than seven months as oil, the country’s key export earner, slid
after  China  raised  interest rates  in a bid to cool growth.  The 30-stock Micex Index tumbled 2.1 percent to 1,729.53 by
the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-
biggest oil producer, slid 2 percent. VTB Group, the nation’s
second-largest lender, dropped 4.9 percent, its lowest close in
more than three months. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
decreased 1.3 percent to 1,910.50.  Oil fell as much as $1.60, or 1.8 percent, to $85.88 a
barrel during trading hours in Moscow after China raised its key
rates as growth accelerated and inflation stayed above 4 percent
for a third month. High oil prices have helped lift the Micex
2.5 percent so far this year, beating the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index’s 2.1 percent drop.  “This might prove to be one instance when markets pay
slightly more attention to the hike,” Julian Rimmer, a trader
of Russian shares at CF Global Trading, said in e-mailed
comments. “Commodities are, in the short term, all looking
stretched except for gold.”  Copper futures for March delivery slid 0.2 percent, to
$4.564 a pound at 10:42 a.m. on the Comex in  New York . Gold rose
1.4 percent to $1,367.40 an ounce as investors sought a hedge
against rising consumer prices.  The China rate move could trigger a 30 percent correction
on the Micex, Gregory Klumov, chief investment officer at
Moscow-based Everest Asset Management, which oversees about $300
million, said.  VTB Tumbles  “The China news should pull oil further into the grave and
that in turn will weigh on Russian stocks,” Klumov said today
in e-mailed comments. Klumov last month added a 10 percent
short, a bet a security will fall in value, to his fund’s
Russian exposure.  VTB plunged to its lowest in more than three months, losing
4.9 percent to 9.64 kopeks as the lender attempted to sell a 10
percent stake worth about $3 billion by the end of this week.  “VTB is coming under added pressure in difficult markets
due to the amount of shares they are trying to sell,” said  Luis
Saenz , London-based director of international sales at brokerage
Otkritie Securities Ltd., in a phone interview.  Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA may buy a 0.9
percent stake in VTB and private equity fund TPG Capital a 0.3
percent stake, according to the calculations based on VTB’s
share price on Feb. 4. A VTB spokesman, who decline to be named,
citing company policy, said yesterday the results of an investor
roadshow would be known Feb. 11.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, Russia’s biggest mining company,
lost as much as 2.2 percent one day after it suspended a share
buyback because of a court order by United Co. Rusal. It closed
down 1.9 percent at 7,239.09 rubles.    Russia ’s drop is a consequence of having been one of the
best performing markets over the last couple of months,” Peter
Westin, chief strategist at Aton Capital in Moscow, said by e-
mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
