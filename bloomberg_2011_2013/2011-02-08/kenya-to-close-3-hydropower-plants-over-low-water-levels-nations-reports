Kenya Electricity Generating Co., the
country’s largest power producer, will shut down three hydro
plants with a total capacity of 23.3 megawatts because of low
water levels,  Daily Nation  reported, citing Joel Ngugi,
operations manager in charge of the Eastern region.  Five hydropower facilities, which produce almost 60 percent
of hydro electricity in the east African nation, will continue
operating, the Nairobi-based newspaper cited Ngugi as saying.
Hydropower accounts for about 65 percent of the country’s total
power generation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
