French citizens in  Burkina Faso 
should be cautious near northern borders with Mali and Niger,
countries that have seen an increase in kidnappings by an al-
Qaeda-affiliated group, said  France ’s Cooperation Minister Henri
de Raincourt.  “Even if the situation is different in  Burkina Faso , it is
advisable to remain careful,” he said after meeting with
President Blaise Compaore in Ouagadougou, the capital, today.  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility for
a rise in the kidnappings of tourists, diplomats and workers in
northwest Africa. Seven people were abducted in the northern
Niger mining town of Arlit in September, and two French
nationals were killed last month after they were kidnapped from
a restaurant in the capital, Niamey.  French President Nicolas Sarkozy visited Mali following the
February 2010 release of aid worker Pierre Camatte, who had been
held for three months by the al-Qaeda affiliate. In August, two
Spanish nationals who were also kidnapped in  Mali  were released
and flown to the Burkinabe capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
