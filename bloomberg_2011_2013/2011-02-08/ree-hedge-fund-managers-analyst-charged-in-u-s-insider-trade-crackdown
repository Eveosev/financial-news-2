Three hedge fund portfolio managers
and a hedge fund analyst were charged today in New York federal
court with  insider trading , U.S. prosecutors said in a statement
announcing a noon press conference in Manhattan.  Two of the portfolio managers were charged with obstruction
of justice, according to Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.  The charges come amid a nationwide federal crackdown on
insider trading that has implicated  hedge funds , technology
companies and so-called expert networking firms.  The U.S. has brought insider trading charges against more
than 30 people since October 2009 as part of the probe. A trial
in the case at the center of the investigation, against former
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, is scheduled to
begin Feb. 28 in New York.  Prosecutors didnâ€™t identify the four new defendants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
