Most European stocks rose as better-
than-estimated results from ArcelorMittal to  Swedbank AB  and  Swatch Group AG  outweighed  China ’s third increase in interest
rates in four months.  ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, and
Swedbank, Sweden’s largest bank by branches, gained at least 2
percent. Swatch rallied 5.8 percent after the world’s biggest
watchmaker said profit increased 42 percent in 2010.  UBS AG 
surged 4.3 percent as Switzerland’s largest bank attracted net
new money from wealthy clients for a second straight quarter.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped less than 0.1 percent to
288.56 at the 4:30 p.m. close of trading in London as four
stocks climbed for every three that fell. The gauge has surged
to near the highest level since September 2008 amid optimism
that the economic recovery is accelerating and as European
governments introduced policies to support indebted countries
using the single currency.  “Earnings are very positive,” said Philipp Musil, who helps
manage about $11 billion at Semper Constantia Privatbank AG in
Vienna. “Investors have more and more confidence in the market
and the economy. The private investor is seeking yield and he
only finds it in risky assets.”  More than 73 percent of the 305 companies in the U.S.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index that reported results since Jan. 10
have topped per-share earnings projections, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In Europe, 57 percent beat forecasts, the
data show.  Benchmark Indexes  National benchmark indexes gained in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. Germany’s DAX Index advanced 0.5 percent and
the U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.7 percent, while France’s CAC climbed
0.4 percent.  China raised its key  interest rates  for the third time
since mid-October today. The benchmark one-year lending rate
will increase to 6.06 percent from 5.81 percent and the deposit
rate will climb to 3 percent from 2.75 percent, effective
tomorrow, the People’s Bank of China said.  “The theme that allowed markets to progress last year was
growth of emerging markets, and we see that growth may be
slowing,” said Matthieu Giuliani, a  fund manager  at Palatine
Asset Management in Paris, which oversees about $5.5 billion.
“There are inflationist signs and that incites China and other
countries to progressively raise rates. This can weigh on those
countries and on Europe and the U.S., which rely on emerging
markets for growth.”    ArcelorMittal  Advances  ArcelorMittal rallied 2.8 percent to 28.02 euros, the
highest since May. The steelmaker reported fourth-quarter
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of
$1.85 billion, beating the $1.68 billion median estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Swedbank climbed 5.2 percent to 105 kronor. The bank
reported fourth-quarter net income of 2.75 billion kronor ($427
million) compared with a loss of 1.8 billion kronor a year
earlier. Analysts had estimated net income of 2.33 billion
kronor, according to a survey compiled by Bloomberg.  Swatch increased 5.8 percent to 413.7 Swiss francs after
the watchmaker said profit increased 42 percent in 2010 as it
sold more Breguet and Omega watches in Asia.  UBS gained 4.3 percent to 18.25 francs, the highest price
since September. Switzerland’s biggest bank attracted net new
money from wealthy clients for a second straight period even as
fourth-quarter net income missed estimates.  Tele2, Automakers    Tele2 AB  climbed 3.2 percent to 147.5 kronor as the
wireless operator with units in the Nordic countries and Russia
said fourth-quarter net income rose to 1.5 billion kronor from
1.1 billion kronor a year earlier. Analysts on average expected
net income of 1.12 billion kronor, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Carmakers had the best performance among 19 industry groups
in the Stoxx 600, rising 3.3 percent, as Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s biggest automaker, raised its full-year profit forecast
by 40 percent as sales in Asia and other emerging markets
exceeded its estimates.    Bayerische Motoren Werke AG , the largest maker of luxury
cars, jumped 4.7 percent to 61.59 euros, while PSA Peugeot
Citroen soared 4.3 percent to 31.20 euros.  Valeo SA , France’s
second-largest auto-parts supplier, surged 7.3 percent to 44.97
euros for the biggest gain in the Stoxx 600.    Volkswagen AG  rose 3.3 percent to 122.90 euros as Europe’s
largest carmaker agreed to give 100,000 western German workers a
3.2 percent pay increase to avert strikes as it boosts
production to match record demand.  Premier Oil Falls    Premier Oil Plc  sank 6.8 percent to 1,994 pence, the
biggest decline in the Stoxx 600, after saying its Catcher North
well found less oil and gas than expected.    ARM Holdings Plc  lost 2.6 percent to 595 pence after

and music companies to “neutral” from “outperform.”    Givaudan SA  lost 3.5 percent to 924.5 francs as the maker
