  Kenya ’s shilling fell, heading for
the lowest level in a week, as dollar demand by fuel retailers
rose and on concern unrest in  Egypt  may cut tea sales to the
biggest buyer of the country’s leaves.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy slumped as
much as 1 percent to 81.97 per dollar and traded 0.2 percent
down at 81.30 by 1:15 p.m. in Nairobi from a close of 81.15
yesterday. A close at this level would be the weakest since Jan.
31.  “The shilling has weakened due to high demand for dollars
by the oil sector as global prices rise and as the expected
inflows from tea sales are likely to be affected by the crisis
in Egypt, one of the main export markets for Kenyan tea,”
Bernard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd.,
said in a telephone interview today.    Brent crude  has traded at about $100 a barrel on concern
political upheaval in Egypt remains unresolved. Brent for March
delivery climbed as much as 0.67 percent to $99.95 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange today.  Egypt is the  biggest importer  of the leaves from Kenya,
according to the Tea Board of Kenya.  The country is the biggest exporter of black tea worldwide
and the leaves are the nation’s biggest foreign-exchange earner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
