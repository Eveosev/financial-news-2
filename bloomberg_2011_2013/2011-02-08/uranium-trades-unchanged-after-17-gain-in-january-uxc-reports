Uranium prices were unchanged in the
past week after gaining 17 percent in January, the biggest
month-on-month increase for the nuclear fuel since June 2007,
according to  Ux Consulting Co.   Uranium-oxide concentrate for immediate delivery traded at
$73 a pound in the week to yesterday, UxC said in an e-mailed
report today, based on the most competitive offer tracked by the
Roswell, Georgia-based company. That compares with $70 on Jan.
25, according to UxC.  “It appears that the market has found at least a temporary
balance as offers reflect a tighter range,” UxC said in the
report. “Although spot volumes reflect that activity levels
remain moderately high, most market participants view the market
as quieting down over the past week.”  Uranium prices, which reached a high of $136 a pound in
2007 before falling to about $40, have risen since mid-2010 as  China  increased the use of nuclear power to curb emissions from
burning coal.  Spot prices may rise to $75 a pound by the second quarter
after China’s imports of the nuclear fuel in December gained 38
percent from the previous month, Macquarie Group Ltd. said in a
Jan. 22 report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
