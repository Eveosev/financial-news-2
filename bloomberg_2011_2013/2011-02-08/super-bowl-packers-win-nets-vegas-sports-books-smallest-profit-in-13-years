  Las Vegas  sports books had their
smallest profit from  Super Bowl  bets in 13 years as the favored
Green Bay Packers beat the Pittsburgh Steelers.    Nevada ’s 183 sports books won $724,176 from the $87.5
million in Super Bowl wagers, according to figures released by
the state’s Gaming Control Board.  The Packers beat the Steelers 31-25 in the  National
Football League ’s championship game on Feb. 6, topping both the
2 1/2-point spread at most Las Vegas casinos and 45-point
projected point total, or over/under.  Nevada’s sports books were still able to make a slight
profit in part because of the commission they charge on standard
wagers and Super Bowl proposition bets, said RJ Bell, president
of Las Vegas-based handicapping information website  Pregame.com .
Bell said prop bets -- such as whether Packers quarterback  Aaron
Rodgers  would pass for more than 300 yards or the Steelers’
defense would score a safety -- now account for about 50 percent
of all Super Bowl wagers.  “Packers and ‘Over’ was by far the worst possible result
for the sports books, and even so they ended up net winners,”
Bell said in an e-mail. “This is a great example of the steep
uphill climb the average player faces trying to win.”  The profit for Nevada’s sports books was the lowest since
1998, when they made $472,033 off Denver’s 31-24 win over Green
Bay. The only time Las Vegas failed to make a profit on Super
Bowl wagers in that span was three years ago, when sports books
lost a combined $2.6 million after the  New York Giants  beat the
heavily favored New England Patriots, who entered the game
unbeaten.  Nevada’s sports books have won a net $115 million on the
Super Bowl since 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
