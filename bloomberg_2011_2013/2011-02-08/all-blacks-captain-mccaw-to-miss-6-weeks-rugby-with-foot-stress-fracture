  New Zealand  captain Richie McCaw was
ruled out of rugby for about six weeks because of a stress
fracture in his right foot, his Canterbury Crusaders team said.  McCaw, who led the All Blacks to 13 wins from 14 Tests last
year, will have a small screw inserted into the fifth metatarsal
of his right foot after consulting a foot and ankle surgeon
today, the Crusaders said.  “The injury is obviously disappointing but it’s not likely
to be one that will bother me in the long term,” McCaw, 30,
said in an e-mailed statement from the Crusaders.   The Christchurch-based team said it had already planned for
McCaw to skip the first two rounds of the revamped Super Rugby
competition starting next week “after a long year of rugby in
2010.” New Zealand will host the 2011  Rugby World Cup  in
September and October.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
