  Husky Energy Inc . is operating its
Lloydminster upgrader in Saskatchewan at reduced rates after a
fire Feb. 2, according to a company spokesman.  “Damage is not deemed to be extensive,”  Graham White  said
in an e-mail. “It was in a subsidiary plant that supplies
product to the main coker unit, but did not damage the coker.”  Husky will operate the upgrader at lower rates while
repairs are completed, according to Graham.  The Lloydminster upgrader processes about 75,000 barrels of
heavy oil a day into 66,000 barrels of a synthetic crude blend,
along with petroleum coke, sulfur and other products, according
to the company’s 2009  fact sheet .  To contact the reporter on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
