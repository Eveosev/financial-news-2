The Swiss franc fell to its lowest
level in two months as stocks rose amid optimism the global
economic recovery is taking hold, damping demand for the safety
of  Switzerland ’s assets.  The franc weakened against all of its 16 most-traded peers
as the MSCI World Index of equities strengthened 0.3 percent and
U.S. 10-year Treasuries declined. Swiss unemployment held at the
lowest in almost three years in January, data showed today.  “The Swiss franc is in an awkward position with risk
easing,” said Peter Rosenstreich, chief market analyst at ACM
Advanced Currency Markets in Geneva. “The  risk premium  that’s
built into the Swiss franc is going to be unwound unless we
encounter a rash of risk aversion.”  The Swiss currency slumped 0.9 percent to 1.3099 per euro
as of 3:48 p.m. in London, after touching 1.3102, the weakest
level since Dec. 8. Against the dollar, it weakened 0.3 percent
to 95.87 centimes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
