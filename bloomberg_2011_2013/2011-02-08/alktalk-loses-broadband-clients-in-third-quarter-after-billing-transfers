  TalkTalk Telecom Group Plc , the
U.K.’s second-largest broadband company, lost broadband
subscribers in the fiscal third quarter as it transferred
customers from an acquired company to its billing system.  The company lost 25,000 subscribers in the quarter as it
sought to integrate Tiscali Spa’s U.K. unit which it bought in
May 2009 for 236 million pounds ($381 million). The company
moved customers to its own billing system at the end of January,
it said today in a statement.  “This has caused some disruption and that disruption can
be cumulative,” Chief Executive Officer Dido Harding said today
in a phone interview. “Almost whoever had bought Tiscali was
going to have to face up to doing this, and not doing it is
worse.”  In November, Harding had lowered the company’s forecast for
broadband net additions to focus on transferring customers to
TalkTalk’s own network. The company said at the time the
customer base would be broadly flat in the second half of the
fiscal year. TalkTalk had 4.2 million customers at the end of
the third quarter.  The London-based company was split off from Carphone
Warehouse Plc in March. It will cut 580 jobs to as it targets 40
million pounds to 50 million pounds of savings by removing
duplication in some back-office functions, Harding said.  TalkTalk also said today the timing of the start of an
Internet-connected television joint venture, named YouView, is
under review. The company had said it would start by mid-2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Jonathan Browning  in  London
