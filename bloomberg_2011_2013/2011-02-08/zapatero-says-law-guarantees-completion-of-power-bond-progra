Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez
Zapatero said a law introduced by his government guarantee that  Spain  will complete a 22 billion-euro ($30 billion) program of
bond sales that will repay the power companies that have
subsidised electricity prices over the past decade.  Separately, Zapatero said during a debate in the Spanish
Senate today the subsidies earned by photovoltaic generators are
guaranteed in future. Zapatero in December cut the above-market
rates solar plants earn. Plant operators said the decision
breached a legal guarantee.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
