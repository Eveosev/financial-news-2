  Volkswagen AG ,  Germany ’s biggest
automotive employer, agreed to give 100,000 western German
workers a 3.2 percent pay raise to avert strikes as the carmaker
boosts production to match record demand.  The pay increase kicks in May 1, with workers receiving a
one-time payment of 1 percent of their base annual salary for
the first three months of the deal, the Wolfsburg, Germany-based
automaker said today. The 16-month contract runs from Feb. 1
through May 31, 2012.  The agreement with VW, which employs 170,000 people in
Germany, may be a benchmark for other unions seeking a bigger
reward for workers in a country leading  Europe ’s economic
recovery. The carmaker is struggling to keep up with demand
after a components shortage halted production at the main
Wolfsburg factory last month. VW aims to increase 2011 sales by
5 percent after record 2010 deliveries of 7.14 million vehicles.  “The fact that this went through without much ado reflects
the high capacity utilization at VW,” said  Tim Schuldt , an
analyst at Equinet AG in  Frankfurt  with a “buy” recommendation
on the shares. “They absolutely wanted to avoid disruptions to
production because of walkouts.”  VW’s preferred shares advanced as much as 2.20 euros, or
1.9 percent, to 121.20 euros and were up 1.5 percent to 120.80
euros as of 10:35 a.m. in Frankfurt trading. The stock has
dropped 0.5 percent this year, valuing the carmaker at 54
billion euros ($73.5 billion).  Inflation Concerns  Rising wage demands come as annual price gains in the euro
area accelerated to 2.4 percent in January, the fastest in more
than two years, and import-price inflation in Germany is running
at the fastest pace in 29 years. The  European Central Bank  is
concerned that rising inflation rates feed into higher wage
demands, causing so-called second-round effects.  ECB Executive Board member Juergen Stark said Jan. 26 the
bank would be ready to raise  interest rates  if second-round
effects materialize. The ECB, which aims to keep inflation just
below 2 percent, last week kept the benchmark lending rates at 1
percent for a 22nd month.  The initial offer from VW last month was for a 2.9 percent
raise in base salaries starting June 1, plus a 300-euro one-time
payment for the period from February to May under a 23-month
agreement. IG Metall had wanted 6 percent more pay and a 12-
month contract. Deutsche Post AG is the biggest stock-listed
employer in Germany, with 207,000 workers in the country.  Good Development  “VW tried to keep the underlying pay increase below 3
percent at all costs,” IG Metall’s chief negotiator Hartmut Meine said today at a press conference in Hanover, Germany.
“But eventually they accepted the need to grant workers a share
in VW’s good economic development.”  VW said in November it plans to invest 51.6 billion euros
in the automotive business through 2015 to help reach a goal of
surpassing  Toyota Motor Corp . in sales and profit. The company
aims to create 50,000 jobs globally by 2015, with about 10
percent of the new positions in Germany, the second-biggest
market for VW, after  China .  Jochen Schumm, VW’s pay negotiator, had said a 2.7 percent
pay-raise agreement for engineering workers that IG Metall
reached with German manufacturers including  General Motors Co .’s
Opel division and  Ford Motor Co .’s local unit in February 2010
should be the guideline for VW’s negotiations.  “We had no choice but to pay heed to the economic
situation, which has changed enormously” since last February,
Schumm said today. He declined to specify the cost burden the
new wage pact will inflict on VW’s coffers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
