Wheat futures advanced for a second
day as importers in the Middle East returned to the global
market, draining supplies.  March-delivery wheat gained as much as 0.5 percent to $8.63
a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, before trading at $8.605
at 1:57 p.m. Singapore time.  Egypt, the world’s biggest wheat buyer, bought 170,000 tons
of soft wheat and canceled a tender for hard wheat, Nomani
Nomani, vice chairman of the General Authority for Supply
Commodities, said in Cairo on Feb. 5.  Turkey’s state grain board is seeking to buy 300,000 metric
tons of milling wheat in a tender, Reuters reported yesterday.
Iraq issued a tender to buy 100,000 tons of wheat on Feb. 6,
after buying 300,000 tons from  Australia  and the U.S., the news
agency reported separately yesterday.  Wheat prices are supported by “heavy buying from the
Middle East countries after  Egypt  started importing wheat
again,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte.,
said by phone from Singapore.  Global wheat demand will outstrip production for the first
time in three years, draining stockpiles to 178 million tons at
the end of this season, according to a Jan. 12  estimate  by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . That would be the lowest since
the 2008-2009 marketing year, according to the agency’s data.  March-delivery corn was little changed at $6.75 a bushel in
Chicago after advancing to $6.825 yesterday, the highest price
since July 15, 2008.  Higher corn prices have encouraged some feed millers to use
wheat from Australia instead, Mitch Morison, general manager
commodities for Melbourne-based AWB Ltd., said in an e-mailed
statement today.  High Values  “High corn values are also encouraging feed-grain
customers to focus on Australian feed-wheat in preference,”
Morison said. “Interest for feed in  Europe ,  Korea  and the
Philippines is providing good support to prices and provides a
very positive picture for growers,” he said.  Soybeans for March delivery climbed 0.2 percent to $14.275
a bushel in Chicago, the first gain in four days.  The soybean harvest in  Brazil ’s Mato Grosso state, the
nation’s biggest producer, is progressing at a slower pace this
year, the state’s crop research institute said.  Farmers had completed 2.8 percent of the harvest as of Jan.
27, down from 9.9 percent at the same time last year, the
institute said yesterday in an e-mailed report.  Brazil is the world’s largest soybean exporter after the
U.S., according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
