  Swatch Group AG , the world’s largest
watchmaker, may acquire component makers to help achieve annual
sales of 10 billion Swiss francs ($10.5 billion) within four
years, Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said.  The maker of Omega watches may spend 250 million francs to
300 million francs to increase capacity, and 150 million francs
on distribution, he said in an interview. Biel, Switzerland-
based Swatch can finance that “easily” with its  cash flow ,
Hayek said.  “There are some companies around that would deserve better
management, and if we would take them over, it would be added
value for these companies and their shareholders,” the CEO
said. He declined to identify potential candidates and said he
has no definite acquisition plans.  Swatch Group’s cash pile increased 66 percent to 1.83
billion francs at the end of 2010, which could help fund
acquisitions or investments in components and distribution,
Hayek said. The maker of Breguet timepieces today reported a 42
percent gain in full-year profit, more than analysts had
estimated, led by sales in  Asia .  Swatch bearer shares rose as much as 2.5 percent in Zurich
trading and was up 8.8 francs, or 2.3 percent, at 400 francs as
of 10:39 a.m. The stock is down 4.1 percent this year.  Swatch Group’s board will discuss the possibility of a
share buyback, Hayek said, declining to say whether he expects
the company to do one.  Sales may rise 10 percent to 15 percent a year over the
medium-term, assuming sufficient production capacity and a
weakening of the Swiss franc, Hayek said. The company has no
need at the moment to buy other watch brands.  ‘Fantastic Portfolio’  “The Swatch Group has a fantastic portfolio of brands,”
he said.  Net income rose to 1.07 billion Swiss francs in 2010 from
759 million francs in 2009, the maker of Blancpain watches said
today. The average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed in the past
28 days was 1.05 billion francs.  Swatch Group last month said gross revenue rose 19 percent
to 6.44 billion francs in 2010, led by demand for luxury brands
in Asia, central  Europe  and the Middle East. Asia accounted for
more than half of  Switzerland ’s watch exports last year, and  Hong Kong  was the largest single market for the industry, the
Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry said last week.  “China will go on and on for years and years,” said Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets in Zurich with a
“buy” recommendation on the stock.  2011 Outlook  The outlook for 2011 is “positive despite the unfavorable
currency constellation at present,” Swatch Group said.  The franc’s 11 percent increase against the dollar and 19
percent gain against the euro in 2010 weighed on last year’s
profitability at the maker of Longines watches.  The watchmaker’s operating margin widened to 23.5 percent
from 17.6 percent in the previous year as factories were busier.  “Swatch has made excellent progress in raising margins
despite adverse currency and raw materials,” Alessandro Migliorini, an analyst at Helvea SA, wrote in a client note.  The company said it will increase its dividend 25 percent
to 5 francs per bearer share and 1 franc per registered share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
