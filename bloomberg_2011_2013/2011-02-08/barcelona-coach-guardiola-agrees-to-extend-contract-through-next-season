  Barcelona  coach Josep Guardiola
agreed to extend his contract with the Spanish soccer champion
until the end of next season, the club said.  “The signing will take place in the next few days,”
Barcelona said on its website last night.  Guardiola, 40, replaced Frank Rijkaard in June 2008 after
coaching the Catalan club’s second-string. His contract was due
to expire at the end of the current campaign.  Barcelona has won eight trophies since Guardiola took over,
including back-to-back Spanish league titles, the 2009 Champions
League and the Club  World Cup . Barca is seven points clear atop
La Liga after securing a record 16th straight victory in Spain’s
elite division four days ago.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
