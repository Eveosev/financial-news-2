South African bonds rose for a second
day as an easing of  Egypt ’s political crisis boosted demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The 13.5 percent security due September 2015 climbed 19
cents to 121.41 rand, pushing down the yield by 5 basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.86 percent as of 1:07 p.m. in
Johannesburg. The 10.5 percent bond due December 2026 climbed 26
cents to 115.75 rand, reducing the yield by 3 basis points to
8.65 percent.  Egypt’s credit risk fell to the lowest level since anti-
government protests began two weeks ago following negotiations
between opposition leaders and Vice President  Omar Suleiman  on
constitutional changes needed to end the 30-year rule of
President Hosni Mubarak. The parties have made “big progress,”
Egyptian billionaire  Naguib Sawiris , a participant in the talks,
said on Bloomberg Television.  “It looks like there will be some resolution in Egypt,
which in this time zone is positive from a risk point of view,”  Ian Scott , a trader at Stanlib Asset Management in Johannesburg,
said by telephone. “There’s also some consolidation in the
market after the recent bout of weakness.”  South African bonds suffered their biggest monthly decline
in almost two years in January as foreign investors sold the
assets on bets the yields of other nations would rise faster
than in Africa’s biggest economy. Brazil, China, Poland, South
Korea, Malaysia and Australia have all started raising  interest
rates , boosting their yield advantage over  South Africa , where
the benchmark rate is at a 30-year low.  Rates, Rand  Central bank Governor Gill Marcus said the 5.5 percent main
interest rate is expected to remain “relatively stable for some
time,” following a unanimous decision by the monetary policy
committee to leave it unchanged on Jan. 20.  The rand gained 0.3 percent to 7.2438 per dollar. Against
the euro, it lost 0.6 percent to 9.8841.  A government report today showed South Africa’s jobless
rate, the highest of 61 countries tracked by Bloomberg, fell to
24 percent in the fourth quarter as the recovery in Africa’s
biggest economy gained momentum. The unemployment rate slid from
25.3 percent in the previous three months, Statistics South  Africa  said in a report released in Pretoria today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
