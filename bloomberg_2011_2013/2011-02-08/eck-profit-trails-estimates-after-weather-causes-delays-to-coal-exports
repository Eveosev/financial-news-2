  Teck Resources Ltd ., the world’s
second-largest metallurgical-coal exporter, reported fourth-
quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates after coal sales
rose less than expected.  Net income declined 12 percent to C$361 million ($363
million), or 61 cents a share, from C$411 million, or 70 cents,
a year earlier, the Vancouver-based company said today in a
statement. Earnings excluding a charge to refinance debt and
other one-time items were 93 cents a share, the company said.
That trailed the C$1.16 average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. Teck’s sales advanced 30 percent to C$2.81 billion
from C$2.17 billion a year earlier.  Severe winter conditions in the fourth quarter in British
Columbia delayed some railway shipments of coal to ocean
terminals near  Vancouver , the company said on Jan. 19. Fourth-
quarter sales of coal used in steelmaking were 6.03 million
tons, less than the 6.3 million predicted by  Jorge Beristain , a
Greenwich, Connecticut-based mining analyst at Deutsche Bank AG.  “Sales in the quarter were lower than expected due to
extremely cold weather during the month of November, which
disrupted coal handling at the Vancouver ports,” the company
said in the statement.  Teck’s full-year coal sales were 23.1 million tons,
compared with the 23 million to 23.8 million forecast by the
company on Oct. 26.  Teck fell 56 cents to $63 at 4:24 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange trading. The shares advanced 99 percent in the past 12
months through today’s close.    Australia ’s BHP Billiton-Mitsubishi Alliance is the world’s
largest exporter of metallurgical coal.  (Teck scheduled a conference call for tomorrow at 11 a.m.
