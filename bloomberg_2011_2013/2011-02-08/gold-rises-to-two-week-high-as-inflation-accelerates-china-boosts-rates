Gold futures climbed to a two-week
high on demand for a hedge against rising consumer prices, after  China  increased borrowing costs to slow inflation. Silver
advanced to a one-month high, topping $30 an ounce.  China joined India, Indonesia, Thailand and  South Korea  in
boosting  interest rates  this year as Asian policy makers seek to
cool the economies leading a global rebound. A report in China
is forecast to show inflation in the country expanded at the
fastest pace in 30 months. World food prices rose to a record in
January and probably will remain elevated, the United Nations
said last week.  “People are buying gold as an inflation hedge,” said  Matthew Zeman , a trader at LaSalle Futures Group in Chicago. “A
more hawkish tone on the part of central banks is going to have
people concerned about inflation.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose $15.90, or 1.2
percent, to settle at $1,364.10 an ounce at 1:15 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Earlier, the price reached $1,368.70, the
highest since Jan. 20.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, said it would accept the metal as collateral for
trading.  The bank “is saying gold is safe enough to use as a store
of value,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “They feel that gold is a stable
asset class, and this is going to support a new wave of
investors.”  Last year, gold rose 30 percent, the 10th straight annual
gain, partly because escalating sovereign debt in Europe
increased the chances of defaults on  government bonds .  Gold also may attract technical buyers after rallying above
its 20-day moving average, near $1,352, Zeman said.  Silver Rally  Silver futures for March delivery gained 92.8 cents, or 3.2
percent, to settle at $30.271 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier,
the price reached $30.285, the highest since Jan. 4.  Silver, which has wider industrial applications than gold,
rose 84 percent last year and touched a 30-year high of $31.275
on Jan. 3, before dropping as low as $26.30 on Jan. 28.  “Ever a fickle mistress, silver bestows its favors
alternately between gold and the industrial sector, reflecting
its hybrid fundamentals,” analysts at Societe Generale said
yesterday in a report. Copper reached a record yesterday.  Palladium futures for March delivery advanced $19.40, or
2.4 percent, to $838.45 an ounce on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Platinum futures for April delivery rose $17.70, or 1
