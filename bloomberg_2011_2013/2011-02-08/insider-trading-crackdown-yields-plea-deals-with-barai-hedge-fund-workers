Samir Barai, a hedge fund portfolio
manager, and Donald Longueuil, a hedge fund research analyst and
managing director, were accused of  insider trading  by federal
prosecutors in New York as two other men pleaded guilty to
related charges.  Barai, the founder of Barai Capital Management LP,
surrendered to authorities and Longueuil was arrested at his
Manhattan home today, according to the  Federal Bureau of
Investigation . Noah Freeman and Jason Pflaum, both hedge fund
research analysts, reached plea agreements with prosecutors
yesterday, and are cooperating with the government, according to
court papers.  The charges come amid a U.S. crackdown on insider trading
that has implicated  hedge funds , technology companies and so-
called expert networking firms.  The U.S. has brought insider-trading charges against more
than 30 people since October 2009 as part of the probe. A trial
in the case at the center of the investigation, against former
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam, is scheduled to
begin Feb. 28 in  New York . He denies wrongdoing.  An earlier complaint in the U.S. investigation of insider
trading filed against Winifred Jiau alleged she worked with a
co-conspirator, who that complaint didnâ€™t identify. That person
is Barai, according to court papers today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
