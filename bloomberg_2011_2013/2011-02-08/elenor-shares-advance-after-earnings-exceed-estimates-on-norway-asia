  Telenor ASA , the Nordic region’s
largest phone company, rose the most in two months in Oslo
trading after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that beat
analyst estimates.  Telenor climbed as much as 2.90 kroner, or 3.3 percent, to
91.90 kroner, the biggest intraday jump since Dec. 2. The stock
traded 2.7 percent higher as of 12:34 p.m.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization was 6.96 billion kroner ($1.21 billion), more than
the 6.86 billion kroner average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. The company improved its margin in Norway,
Thailand and  Malaysia  as data use on handsets increased.  Asian revenue rose 13 percent in established operations,
and Telenor reported a gain of 1.3 billion kroner from its
holdings in VimpelCom Ltd. The Norwegian company said it
forecasts revenue growth exceeding 5 percent this year,
excluding acquisitions or disposals, approximately in line with
growth for last year.  “Capital returns are strong for a growth stock,” Andrew Lee and other Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report.  Sales rose 11 percent to 24.9 billion kroner, beating the
average Bloomberg estimate of 24.3 billion kroner. Net income
declined to 2.1 billion kroner from 2.17 billion kroner a year
earlier, Fornebu, Norway-based Telenor said today in a
 statement . Analysts had predicted profit of 2.56 billion kroner.  “Going forward, we expect significant long-term effects
from the ongoing investments in network modernizations,” Chief
Executive Officer Jon Fredrik Baksaas said in the statement. The
company forecast this year’s Ebitda margin to be about 31
percent from 30.8 percent last year.  Telenor proposed a dividend of 3.80 kroner per share. The
company will consider share buybacks in coming quarters, Chief
Financial Officer Richard Olav Aa said on a teleconference.  The Uninor division in  India , in which Telenor reached a
majority stake last year, reported a fourth-quarter operating
loss of 1.27 billion kroner. Subscriptions in the quarter rose
by 4.3 million for a total 12.3 million at the end the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
