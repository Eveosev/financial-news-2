  New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
stopped a proposed natural-gas facility 16 miles (26 kilometers)
off the state’s coast, citing potential environmental risks.  The governor, a first-term Republican, said he was using
authority granted to him by the federal Deepwater Port Act to
veto the project. The decision prevents Liberty Natural Gas from
building and operating an offshore port to receive foreign
vessels transporting liquid natural gas to the U.S.  Christie’s administration in November filed a motion to
intervene in opposition to Liberty Natural’s application. The
company’s proposal also includes construction of a 9.2-mile
onshore pipeline from Linden to Perth Amboy, and 44 miles of
submerged pipeline to transport as much as 2.4 billion cubic
feet a day of  natural gas  from the deepwater port to shore,
according to a statement from Christie’s office.  “I take very seriously our obligation to protect the
environmental health of our coastal waters,” Christie, 48, said
in the statement. “We must ensure that our 126 miles of
shoreline remain an economic driver for tourism and that our
fishing and shellfish industries remain healthy and productive
now and for future generations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
