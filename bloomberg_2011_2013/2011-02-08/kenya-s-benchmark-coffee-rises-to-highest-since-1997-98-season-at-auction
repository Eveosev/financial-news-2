  Kenya ’s benchmark coffee grade
rallied to the highest level since the 1997-98 season at an
auction today, tracking higher prices in the global market, the
Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The top AA grade sold for as much as $1,022 for a 50-
kilogram (110-pound) bag, compared with $810 a week earlier, the
exchange said by e-mail from the capital, Nairobi.  “Prices are rising because we have low stocks in the
country,” Kizito Keya, a coffee trader at Mumba Coffee Ltd.,
said by phone from Nairobi. “The rising in global prices is also
helping the market rally.”  The March delivery contract for arabica, the coffee variety
produced by Kenya, traded at $2.482 a pound at 11:40 a.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York , 5 cents from a 13-year high of $2.536
reached on Feb. 3. The commodity has surged 78 percent in the
past year on concern that supplies from Brazil and  Colombia  may
be limited.  The average price for the grade increased 0.2 percent to
$506.62 a bag compared with last week, while supplies of the
grade declined 0.5 percent to 6,157 bags, it said.  The average price for all the coffee sold climbed 4.6
percent to $412.99 a bag from $394.87 last week after supplies
declined, the exchange said.  Some dealers had good-quality beans while the bulk were
average because of a reduction in supplies from the Mt. Kenya
region, Keya said.  Sales fell 11 percent to 8,822 bags worth $4.45 million,
from $4.75 million last week, the exchange said. Supplies at the
11th auction of the 2010-11 season fell 7.8 percent to 19,295
bags from the previous sale, the agency said.  Kenya’s coffee production in the 12 months through
September may decline 27 percent to 40,000 metric tons of the
beans from the previous forecast of between 49,000 and 55,000
tons, James Wahome, the quality manager at the Coffee Board of
Kenya, said on Jan. 17.  The country produced 45,000 tons last season. Kenya
harvests the bulk of its crop from October through December,
while a secondary crop is reaped from April to June.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
