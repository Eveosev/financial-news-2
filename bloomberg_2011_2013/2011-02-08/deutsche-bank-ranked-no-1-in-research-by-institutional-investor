  Deutsche Bank AG  jumped to number one
in Institutional Investor magazine’s annual ranking of European
equity research analysts, ending  UBS AG ’s nine-year run in the
top slot.  The Frankfurt-based lender was placed sixth last year in
the magazine’s all-Europe research team rankings, according to
data posted on Institutional Investor’s  website  today. UBS was
placed second this year and Bank of America Corp. third,
according to the survey of 1,900 money managers.  Credit Suisse
Group AG  and JPMorgan Cazenove, placed joint second last year,
fell to fourth place to tie with  Morgan Stanley .  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest bank, said last week that
full-year revenue from equity sales and trading rose 17 percent
to 3.11 billion euros ($4.24 billion) from 2009. Anshu Jain, who
became sole head of the corporate and investment banking unit in
July, is investing in equities and commodities to lower
dependence on debt trading.  “We have invested consistently in research in recent years
and are pleased that our clients recognise the quality, focus
and timeliness of our analysis,” David Folkerts-Landau, global
head of research at Deutsche Bank, said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporters responsible for this story:
