  ArcelorMittal , the world’s biggest
steelmaker, reported a fourth-quarter loss and forecast a
“stronger” year in 2011 as demand rebounds.  The net loss was $780 million compared with net income of
$1.1 billion a year earlier, the Luxembourg-based company said
today in a statement. Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization was $1.85 billion, beating the
average estimate for $1.68 billion of 17 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “2010 continued to be a challenging year,” Chief
Executive Officer  Lakshmi Mittal  said in the statement. “The
gradual underlying demand recovery continues and we expect 2011
to be stronger than 2010.”  Ebitda will be $2 billion to $2.5 billion in the first
quarter, it said, compared with the average estimate of $2.03
billion of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Prices for hot-rolled steel coil, a benchmark product used
in cars and buildings, fell 9.8 percent in the fourth quarter to
505 euros ($684) a metric ton, following an 8.2 percent drop in
the third quarter, according to data compiled by Metal Bulletin.  Nippon Steel Corp., Japan’s biggest producer, cut its full-
year profit forecast on Jan. 28 on falling prices and floods in  Australia  that pushed up raw material costs. Posco, the world’s
third-largest steelmaker, had a bigger-than-expected drop in
quarterly earnings, and U.S. Steel Corp. last month reported an
eighth straight net loss.  Steelmakers face volatile prices as they buy  iron ore  and
coal for immediate delivery or in quarterly supply accords after
the collapse of a decades old annual pricing system.  ArcelorMittal, formed by the takeover of Arcelor SA by
Mittal Steel Co. in 2006, said in November it would welcome a
return to annual pricing because of the difficulty of predicting
costs and passing them onto customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
