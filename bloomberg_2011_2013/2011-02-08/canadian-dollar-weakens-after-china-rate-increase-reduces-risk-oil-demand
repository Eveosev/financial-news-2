  Canada ’s dollar fell from within one
cent of a two-year high against its U.S. counterpart as  China ’s
interest-rate increase limited demand for commodities.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, declined versus all of its
major counterparts except the Swiss franc. Futures on crude oil,
Canada’s biggest export, touched the lowest level in more than a
week, and natural gas dropped.  “The rate hike in China has put some pressure on commodity
prices,” said Charles St-Arnaud, a foreign-exchange strategist
at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  New York . “The Canadian dollar has
been really driven this year by higher commodity prices.”  The loonie slid 0.4 percent to 99.52 cents per  U.S. dollar 
at 5 p.m. in Toronto, from 99.08 yesterday. It touched 98.32
cents on Feb. 4, the strongest level since May 2008. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0048.  The Canadian dollar extended its losses after a $32 billion
U.S. sale of three-year Treasury notes drew the lowest demand
since May 2007 for the category of bidders including foreign
central banks. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes surged,
bolstering the U.S. dollar.  Commodity prices fell after China’s rate hike, pushing
natural gas futures down 0.9 percent. Canada is the third-
largest producer of natural gas.  Futures on crude oil decreased as much as 1.8 percent to
$85.88 a barrel, the lowest level since Jan. 28, before falling
0.1 percent to $87.42.  China’s benchmark one-year lending rate will increase to
6.06 percent from 5.81 percent, effective tomorrow, the People’s
Bank of China said on its website. The one-year deposit rate
will rise to 3 percent from 2.75 percent.  Bonds Drop  Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note up six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 3.49 percent. The yield touched 3.50 percent, the
highest level since May 18. The price of the 3.5 percent
security maturing in June 2020 slid 45 cents to C$100.10.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 1.1 percent to 1.6741
Brazilian reais, from 1.6923 yesterday. The loonie decreased 1
percent to 7.2288 rand, from 7.3007.  Canada’s dollar has at least touched a level stronger than
parity with its U.S. counterpart every day since Dec. 27, the
longest such period since December 2007.  “People are already long Canada and don’t want to go
longer at these levels,” said  Amelia Bourdeau , a currency
strategist at UBS AG in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . A long is a bet
the price of an asset will increase.  Loonie Positioning  Bets the Canadian dollar will gain against the U.S.
currency have fallen from 47,757 on Jan. 11, the highest level
since May, according to figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the Canadian dollar
compared with those on a drop was 33,814 on Feb. 1, compared
with net longs of 31,719 a week earlier.  To contact the reporter for this story:
