  Mvelaphanda Resources Ltd . gained to
the highest in more than eight months after saying it will spin
off its shares in  Northam Platinum Ltd ., which then plans to buy
the South African mining investment company.  Mvelaâ€™s stock surged as much as 2.27 rand, or 6 percent, to
39.97 rand, its highest intraday level since May 28, and was
trading at 39.24 rand as of 9:48 a.m. in Johannesburg.  Northam will buy Mvela once it has distributed its shares
in the platinum miner to investors and bought out Afripalm
Resources Ltd., the Johannesburg-based companies said in a joint
statement today. Northam will offer 9.6 of its shares for every
100 Mvela shares, based on a Northam share price of 47 rand, and
valuing the takeover at 982.8 million rand, the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
