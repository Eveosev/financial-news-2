  Exxon Mobil Corp .’s refinery in Baton
Rouge, Louisiana, is performing maintenance on a fluid catalytic
cracker and associated units that will last several weeks, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Allexon, based in Fairfax, Virginia, said the refinery
began the turnaround on Feb. 5.  Catalytic crackers are the main gasoline-making units at a
refinery. The Baton Rouge plant, second-largest in the U.S.
after Exxon’s refinery in Baytown, Texas, has a fluid catalytic
cracking capacity of 243,000 barrels a day, according to the
U.S. Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration.  The EIA’s 2010 refinery capacity report does not say how
many catalytic crackers are at the Baton Rouge plant, and
Allexon said he had “no further details to share.”  The Baton Rouge refinery processes domestic crudes from  Louisiana , Texas, Mississippi and Alaska, according to the
company’s website. It also imports crude from Mexico, the  North
Sea , West Africa,  South America , Central America and the Arabian
Gulf.  The plant can process 525,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
