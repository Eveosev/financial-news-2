     Feb. 8 (Bloomberg) -  Avon Products Inc ., the world’s
largest door-to-door cosmetics merchant, fell as much as 6.9
percent, the most in more than three months, after fourth-
quarter sales and profit missed analysts’ projections.  Avon declined $1.76 to $27.59 at 9:38 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the largest drop since Oct.
28. Excluding some items, Avon’s profit fell to 59 cents a
share, Avon said today in a statement. That compared with the
66-cent average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose
1.3 percent to $3.18 billion, also trailing predictions.  Service disruptions in  Brazil  and “weak performance” in  Russia  ate into sales last quarter, Chief Executive Officer
Andrea Jung said in the statement. Latin America accounts for
about 40 percent of New York-based Avon’s total sales, while  North America  makes up about one-fifth.  Avon expects “mid-single digit” revenue growth this year,
Jung said in the statement. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast 9.5 percent revenue growth.  Jung is rejiggering Avon’s portfolio and has identified
higher-end skin care and mother and baby products as potential
growth areas. The New York-based company bought jewelry company
Silpada Designs Inc. last year.  Earnings exclude the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation
and restructuring costs. On that basis, earnings were 68 cents
in the year-earlier quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
