  DBS Group Holdings Ltd .,  Southeast
Asia ’s biggest bank, said individual customers in  Singapore  are
now able to purchase and deposit yuan to take advantage of  China ’s currency appreciation and rising interest rates.  Investors may buy yuan in Hong Kong’s offshore market using
accounts with a minimum S$50,000 ($39,290) of funds, V Arivazhagan, head of consumer treasury products at DBS, said at
a press briefing today in Singapore. Yuan bought using the
facility can’t be transferred to onshore accounts in China.  Interest rates range from 0.735 percent for a one-month
deposit of less than 250,000 yuan ($37,965) to 1.085 percent for
six-month deposits involving sums of at least 2.5 million yuan
but less than 5 million yuan, according to a document DBS e-
mailed to priority-banking customers. The bank offers a maximum
0.6 percent interest on local-currency amounts of less than S$1
million placed with it for two years, according to its  website .  “This allows investors to participate in the potential
appreciation of the yuan and the rising  interest rates ,”
Arivazhagan told reporters.  Banks in mainland China pay interest of 2.5 percent on six-
month deposits and 3.55 percent on two-year deposits, rates that
are capped by the central bank. The People’s Bank of China
raised its benchmark policy rates twice in the fourth quarter to
combat inflation, lifting the six-month rate by 52 basis points
and the two-year rate by 76 basis points. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Appreciation Prospects  The yuan has appreciated 3.5 percent to 6.5938 per dollar
in  Shanghai  since a two-year peg was relaxed in June and
economists surveyed by Bloomberg predict it will climb a further
4.7 percent in 2011, based on the median of 25 forecasts.
China’s financial markets have been shut since Feb. 1 for the
Lunar New Year holiday and will reopen tomorrow.  The yuan, also known as the renminbi, was 0.2 percent
stronger today at 6.5515 per dollar in  Hong Kong  as of 3:39 p.m.
local time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s 0.6
percent higher than the last closing level in Shanghai. The
premium reached 2.6 percent on Oct. 19, the widest since
offshore trading began in July.  “We expect more appreciation of the renminbi of about 5
percent per year,” Lim Say Boon, Chief Investment Officer at
DBS in Singapore, said at today’s briefing. “If there are any
surprises, it’s likely to be on the upside.”  China’s consumer prices rose 4.6 percent from a year
earlier in December, after a 5.1 percent advance the previous
month that was the biggest since July 2008. Inflation
accelerated to 5.4 percent in January, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed before data next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
