Prime London home prices will
increase in 2011 and over the next five years because of a
shortage of properties and rising demand from domestic buyers,
 Cluttons LLP  said.  Values across the U.K. may rise 2.5 percent a year, with
central London properties gaining 5 percent, the London-based
real-estate broker said today in a five-year forecast. Improved
economic conditions and the return of bonuses should drive
further growth, it said.  British buyers are returning to the market to compete with
overseas investors who have been motivated by lower prices and a
weak pound, Cluttons said. This year, prices may gain 1 percent
nationwide and 2.5 percent for prime central London properties,
defined as homes in central London districts including Belgravia
and Chelsea. It doesn’t set a price threshold.  “We are seeing very strong price growth as buyers compete
for the limited supply of prime property available, which is
driving the market to levels in excess of the 2007 peak,” James
Hyman, partner for residential sales, said in the statement.
“The return of the domestic buyer to the market can in part be
attributed to the return of bonuses increasing buying power.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
