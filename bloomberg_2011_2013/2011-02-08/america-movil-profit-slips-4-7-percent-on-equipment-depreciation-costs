  America Movil  SAB, Latin America’s
largest wireless carrier, said fourth-quarter profit fell 4.7
percent as costs to depreciate older technology increased.  Net income fell to 24.2 billion pesos ($2.01 billion), or
60 centavos a share, from 25.4 billion pesos a year earlier,
Mexico City-based America Movil said yesterday in an e-mailed
statement. Sales rose 6 percent to 162 billion pesos.  The pace of technological advances in the market is growing
so quickly that America Movil had to reduce the value on its
books of older equipment, the company said. It categorized 8.9
billion pesos of its 26.8 billion pesos in depreciation and
amortization expenses in the quarter as “extraordinary
charges.”  Manuel Jimenez, an analyst with Ixe Grupo Financiero SAB in  Mexico  City, had forecast net income of 23.4 billion pesos and
sales of 159.2 billion pesos.  “We’re seeing a lot more intensive use of smartphones and
a migration from pre-paid plans into broadband service,”
Jimenez said in an interview before the earnings report. “This
should give greater stability to the company and higher revenue
this year.”  The company also recorded an extraordinary deferred tax
credit of 5 billion pesos in  Brazil .  Depreciation charges represented 16.5 percent of sales in
the fourth quarter compared with 14.3 percent in the previous
three-month period, America Movil said. The charges will decline
to 12 percent throughout 2011, the company said.  Subscriber Gains  America Movil, whose largest shareholder is Mexican
billionaire  Carlos Slim , controls Telefonos de Mexico SAB, the
nation’s largest fixed-line and Internet provider, and Telmex
Internacional SAB, the regional fixed-line unit. The company is
seeking to expand into markets including  Costa Rica  and  Serbia .  The company added 8.2 million mobile subscribers to close
the quarter with 225 million. The biggest additions came in
Brazil and Mexico.  America Movil expects to add as many as 17 million mobile-
phone subscribers in 2011, compared with 24 million last year.
The forecast would give the company a subscriber growth rate of
7.6 percent, down from 12 percent in 2010. America Movil last
year forecast 64 million subscriber additions through 2014,
excluding the U.S.  America Movil dropped 58 centavos to 33.96 pesos in Mexico
City trading. The shares have fallen 4.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
