  Wells Fargo & Co ., the biggest U.S.
home lender, said Chief Financial Officer Howard I. Atkins is
retiring for personal reasons and will be replaced by Chief
Administrative Officer Timothy J. Sloan, effective immediately.  Atkins, who turns 60 this week, is leaving the San
Francisco-based bank after 10 years, according to a statement
today from Wells Fargo. His departure “is unrelated to the
company’s financial condition or financial reporting,” the bank
said. His retirement becomes effective in August, following an
unpaid leave of absence that starts immediately, the bank said.  Sloan, 50, has been with Wells Fargo for 23 years, said
Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, 57, in the statement. Sloan
moved into his current post last year and previously served as
head of commercial banking, real estate and specialized
financial services.  Wells Fargo is ranked fourth by assets among U.S. lenders.
Atkins’ tenure included guiding the bank through its takeover of
Wachovia Corp. after the  Charlotte , North Carolina-based lender
almost collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
