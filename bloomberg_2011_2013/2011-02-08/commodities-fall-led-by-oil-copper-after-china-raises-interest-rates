Commodities fell after  China , the
world’s biggest buyer of energy, industrial metals and soybeans,
raised  interest rates , crimping raw materials demand.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI spot index of 24 raw materials
dropped 0.6 percent to 642.22 by 12:02 p.m. in London as crude
oil dropped 1.3 percent and wheat declined 0.8 percent. Copper
lost 1.2 percent, the biggest decline in two weeks.  China raised interest rates for the third time since mid-
October after growth accelerated and inflation stayed above 4
percent for a third month. Wheat has jumped 76 percent in the
past month, and global food prices gained to a record last
month, according to the  United Nations .  “The hike is mainly an effort to cool down the economy,
which is more or less the same thing as saying that you want to
cool down energy and industrial metal consumption,” said Filip
Petersson, an analyst at Stockholm-based bank SEB AB. “If you
take things one step further, there is a fear that the Chinese
economy could overheat and get out of control and that Chinese
authorities will have to go to extreme measures to cool it down,
thereby triggering a hard landing of the economy, which would
have a major impact on industrial metals and energy
consumption.”  Oil, Copper  Crude oil for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell as much as $1.60, or 1.8 percent, to $85.88 a
barrel, the lowest price since Jan. 28, and was last at $86.37.  Brent crude  for March settlement was down $1.10, or 1.1
percent, at $98.15 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in London, extending its 2.5 percent drop of the past two days.  Copper for delivery in three months declined $123 to $9,922
a ton. Investors in China probably hold “significant amounts”
of industrial metal stockpiles, and higher rates will “increase
the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding commodity
investments and lead to the liquidation of physical metal
inventories,” Royal Bank of Scotland analyst Daniel Major said
by e-mail today.  Corn fell 0.7 percent to $6.7025 a bushel and soybeans
declined 0.3 percent to $14.1975 a bushel.  Precious metals held gains, with gold up 0.2 percent to
$1,353.65 an ounce and palladium rising 0.2 percent to $819.50
an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
