Gasoline advanced on speculation that
refinery shutdowns may limit stockpiles of the motor fuel and
after U.S. business confidence increased, boosting speculation
that the economy and fuel demand may improve.  Futures rose the most in seven days as  Valero Energy Corp .
stopped production at a 75,000-barrel-a-day fluid catalytic
cracker at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery. Exxon Mobil Corp.’s  Baton Rouge ,  Louisiana , plant shut a catalytic cracker Feb. 5
for several weeks. Confidence among U.S. small companies climbed
in January to a three-year high.  “We continue to have a rash of refinery problems and
refineries down in maintenance,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago . “And any time you
show small business confidence, it improves the economic outlook
and should be a positive for the market.”  Gasoline for March delivery added 4.37 cents, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $2.4942 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The gasoline crack spread, based on March
contracts, widened $2.38 to $17.82 a barrel, an eight-month
high.  Valero, the largest U.S. independent refiner, also shut its
Aruba refinery after a water tank collapsed Feb. 4.  Sunoco Inc.’s Philadelphia refinery was scheduled to shut a
crude unit and a fluid catalytic cracker this month, Lynn Elsenhans, the company’s chief executive officer, said in a
conference call with investors Feb. 4.  “When a cat cracker goes down, then we lose gasoline
supplies,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  Rising Optimism  The National Federation of Independent Business optimism
index increased to 94.1, the highest level since the recession
began in December 2007, the Washington-based group said today.  Stockpiles of gasoline probably rose 2.6 million barrels
last week, according to the median estimate of 16 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg News. Gasoline inventories rose 6.15 million
barrels in the week ended Jan. 28 to 236.2 million, the highest
since March 1993, according to Energy Department data. Demand,
measured by deliveries to wholesalers, slipped to the lowest
level since February 2010.  “Even with the refinery issues, look at the level of
stockpiles out there,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
146,713 contracts as of 3:21 p.m. in  New York , 29 percent above
the average during the past three months. Heating oil volume was
119,469 contracts, 5.7 percent above the three-month average.  Cold Snap  Heating oil gained as colder weather was projected for the
U.S. Northeast. A frigid blast driven by winds of 30 miles an
hour will send New York City temperatures plunging more than 20
degrees today as arctic cold grips much of the U.S.  “I would expect this was a pop from the weather,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security Analysis Inc in
Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Heating oil inventories in the week ended Jan. 28 dropped
6.7 percent to 39.2 million, the lowest level since May 2009,
according to Energy Department data.  Heating oil for March delivery added 2.57 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $2.7318 a gallon, the first increase in
four days.  The heating oil crack spread, based on March contracts,
added $1.62 to $27.80 a barrel, the highest level since July
2008.  The premiums of gasoline and heating oil over West Texas
Intermediate oil widened as European benchmark Brent crude
futures advanced to the highest level versus WTI, the U.S.
benchmark, since at least April 2003. The spread, based on March
futures traded on Nymex and ICE Futures Europe, increased $1.21
to a record-high $12.98 a barrel.  Distillate Supplies  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
probably fell 1 million barrels, according to the survey.  Distillate stockpiles fell 1.58 million barrels to 164.1
million in the week ended Jan. 28 and demand increased 4.9
percent, according to department data. Inventories of heating
oil dropped 6.7 percent to 39.2 million, the lowest level since
May 2009.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, lost 0.5
cent to $3.117 a gallon yesterday, AAA said on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
