U.S. stocks rose, sending the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  higher for a seventh straight day, as  McDonald’s Corp . led a rally in consumer companies after
reporting higher-than-estimated monthly sales.  McDonald’s jumped 3.2 percent, the most since May, after
January same-store sales increased 5.3 percent. Urban Outfitters
Inc. climbed 3 percent after Citigroup Inc. analysts raised
their rating on the shares.  The Dow climbed 24.98 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,186.61
at 10:29 a.m. in New York, extending its longest streak of gains
since July and rising to the highest level on a closing basis
since June 16, 2008. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased
0.2 percent to 1,321.12, also the highest since June 2008.  Earlier declines came amid concern that higher  interest
rates  in China will slow the global economic recovery.  U.S. stocks rose yesterday as takeover announcements and
improving earnings bolstered investors’ optimism. Almost three-
quarters of the companies in the  S&P 500  that have reported
quarterly results since Jan. 10 have topped analysts’
projections for per-share profit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Earnings for S&P 500 companies rose 29 percent in 2010, the
fastest growth since 1995, and will rally 15 percent this year,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
