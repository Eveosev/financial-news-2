Anglo Irish Bank Corp. Chairman Alan Dukes said the nation’s lenders may need about a further 50
billion euros ($68.2 billion) of capital, more than absorbing a
bailout fund for the banks.  The Dublin-based government has already poured 46 billion
euros into the banks, and can tap 35 billion euros of extra
capital under a bailout agreed last year with the  International
Monetary Fund  and European Union.  “A clean banking core will require something in the region
of 50 billion euros,” Dukes, 65, a former finance minister,
said in an e-mailed copy of a speech today. “A clean banking
restructuring implies the acceptance of irrecoverable losses.”  The bailout provides for an initial 10 billion euros in
capital to be available to the banks, with another 25 billion
euros if needed, as lenders grapple with loan losses after the
collapse of a decade-long real-estate boom.  Irish central bank
Governor  Patrick Honohan  said last month that he would be
“disappointed and surprised” if the entire 35 billion euros
was needed.  The state has injected 29.3 billion euros into nationalized
Anglo Irish. Dukes, appointed as chairman in June, said the
remaining “black hole” in the Irish financial system may
amount to between 20 billion euros and 40 billion euros.  Filling that gap requires “long term 20 year to 30 year
funding, on which there will be no return,” Dukes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
