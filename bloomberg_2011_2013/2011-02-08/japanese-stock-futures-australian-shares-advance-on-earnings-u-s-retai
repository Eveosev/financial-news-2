(Corrects gain in S&P 500 in fifth paragraph.)  Japanese  stock futures  and Australian
shares rose as companies reported improving earnings and U.S.
retail sales rebounded.  American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world’s largest automaker, jumped 4.5 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo yesterday after the company raised its
profit forecast. Those of Honda Motor Co., a competitor, gained
1.3 percent. Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , the country’s
biggest lender, climbed 2.3 percent in Sydney after the bank
said fiscal first-half profit increased.  “Although there are factors of uncertainty, the  U.S.
economy  is steadily improving and the environment is getting
supportive for stocks,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities
manager in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,680 in  Chicago , compared with 10,630 in Osaka,
Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,670 in  Osaka  at
8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained
0.6 percent today, and  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index climbed 0.2
percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index gained 0.4 percent yesterday in  New
York  after the International Council of Shopping Centers said
weekly retail sales increased 2.2 percent in the week ended Feb.
5 following four straight declines, and as McDonald’s Corp.
rallied after reporting higher-than-estimated monthly results.  China Reopens  China’s stock market reopens today following a one-week
break for the Lunar New Year. Yesterday, the People’s Bank of
China raised the one-year lending rate by a quarter point to
6.06 percent and the one-year deposit rate an equivalent amount
to 3 percent.  “There will be a wait-and-see mood in the market as people
want to see how the Chinese market moves after the Chinese New
Year holidays,” Nikko Cordial’s Nishi said.  Today, 31 of the 1,019 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 374 that have

according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.6 percent this year
to the last close, compared with gains of 5.3 percent by the S&P
500 and 4.6 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark were valued at 14.2 times estimated earnings on
