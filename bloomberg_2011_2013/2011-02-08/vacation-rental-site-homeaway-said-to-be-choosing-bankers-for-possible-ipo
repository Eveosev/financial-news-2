HomeAway.com Inc. , the vacation
rental website, is choosing bankers for an initial public
offering, two people with knowledge of the plans said.  No time frame for a decision was provided by the people,
who declined to be named because the talks are private.
Companies planning to go public hire banks before filing a
prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  HomeAway has raised about $500 million in private capital
since it was founded in 2005. More Web companies may be
preparing to go public following last month’s IPO filing by
LinkedIn Corp., the business-networking site that disclosed
plans to raise $175 million in a share sale. IPOs picked up in
2010 after the biggest two-year drought in at least 38 years.  Eileen Buesing, a spokeswoman for Austin, Texas-based
HomeAway, declined to comment.  The company has more than 540,000 vacation rental listings
in 120 countries, according to its website. Homeowners pay an
annual fee of about $300 to list, and the site is free for
renters. In addition to HomeAway.com, the company runs Vacation
Rentals by Owner, or  VRBO.com , and VacationRentals.com.  Austin  Ventures, also based in Austin, and Redpoint
Ventures in  Menlo Park ,  California , first invested in HomeAway
in 2005. Redpoint, along with  Palo Alto , California-based
Technology Crossover Ventures and Institutional Venture
Partners, invested  $250 million  in 2008.  Super Bowl Ad  Todd Chaffee, a partner at Menlo Park-based Institutional
Venture, said at the time that the financing “gives HomeAway
significant resources to accelerate both organic growth and
growth through strategic acquisitions.”  HomeAway gained notoriety this week after running a Super
Bowl advertisement that depicted a family fighting for space in
a hotel room. The scuffle resulted in a fake baby being launched
into a glass wall and sliding down with a smushed face. HomeAway
later apologized and removed the ad from its website.  “We created the ‘test baby’ campaign to highlight pitfalls
when families squeeze into small spaces, and to shed light on
the benefits of space, value and privacy of vacation rentals,”
Chief Executive Officer Brian Sharples said in a  statement . “We
feel we made a mistake in judgment, and for that all of us at
HomeAway are truly sorry.”  Last year, HomeAway bought Escapia Inc. and Instant
Software Inc., providers of software for vacation rentals, which
together represent almost 1,700 property-management customers,
HomeAway said in October. The acquisitions lifted the company’s
workforce to 735.  Competition is emerging.  Airbnb Inc. , a San Francisco-based
startup, has customers renting property in more than 9,000
cities in 170 countries, according to its website. The company,
founded in 2008, received $7.2 million in funding late last year
from  Sequoia Capital  and  Greylock Partners . Unlike HomeAway,
Airbnb customers list their property for free, and the company
makes money by taking a cut of each transaction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
