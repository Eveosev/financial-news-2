Palm oil  climbed to the highest
level in more than a week on speculation that a rebound in
demand will boost exports from  Malaysia , reducing inventories in
the world’s largest producer after  Indonesia .  The contract for delivery in June advanced 1.1 percent to
2,441 ringgit ($782) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest price at close for the most-active
contract since March 11. Futures have tumbled 27 percent in the
past year as demand slowed.  Exports from Malaysia gained 11 percent to 927,665 tons in
the first 20 days of this month from the same period in
February, surveyor Intertek said. Shipments rose 14 percent to
922,987 tons, estimates from Societe Generale de Surveillance
show. Inventories dropped to 2.44 million tons in February from
an all-time high of 2.63 million tons in December, according to
the Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Malaysia maintained a 4.5 percent
tax on shipments of crude palm oil for a second month in April.  “When prices are more attractive there’ll be some buyers
coming into the market,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. “The tax for April is the same so there’s
really no rush for them to push something out ahead of April.”  Palm prices may be near a bottom as demand increases in
part as supplies of  soybean oil  tighten, Oil World said
yesterday. Exports of soybean oil, which like palm can be used
in cooking and biofuel, from the top three shippers slumped 23
percent in February from a year earlier, the Hamburg-based
researcher said, referring to Argentina, Brazil and the U.S.  Soybean oil for May delivery climbed 0.3 percent to 49.64
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May gained 0.6 percent to $14.155 a bushel. Soybean oil was
about 1.4 times costlier than palm.  Refined palm oil for September delivery advanced 0.2
percent to close at 6,344  yuan  ($1,021) a ton on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil ended little changed at 8,100
yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
