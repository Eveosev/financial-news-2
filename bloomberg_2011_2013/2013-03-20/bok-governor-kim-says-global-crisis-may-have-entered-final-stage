 The central bank chief of Asia’s
fourth-largest economy said the crisis that rocked the global
economy and financial system in recent years may have entered
its final stage.  “We can’t say the crisis is very near an end yet but we’re
in a process of wrapping it up gradually,”  Bank of Korea 
Governor Kim Choong Soo said at a meeting with economists in
 Seoul  today. He didn’t refer to Cyprus, where lawmakers
yesterday rejected a levy on  bank deposits  as part of a
financial bailout of the nation.  In the U.S., housing-market gains are rippling through the
world’s biggest economy, more than four years after a property
meltdown triggered the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., a freeze in credit markets and a global recession. Korean
policy makers are focused on the outcome of a Federal Reserve
meeting that ends today as U.S. officials consider an early end
to so-called quantitative easing, Kim said today.  The Bank of  Korea  will consider domestic growth and
inflation and global conditions for trade when setting monetary
policy, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
