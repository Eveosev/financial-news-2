U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said the levy on  banks  will be increased for a
sixth time to ensure lenders don’t benefit from a cut in
corporation tax.  The tax on balance sheets will rise to 0.142 percent from
next year, Osborne told Parliament today in  London . It increased
to 0.13 percent this year.  “As with previous reductions in the corporate  tax rate , I
do not intend to pass the benefit onto to the banking sector,”
Osborne said.  The levy is designed to raise at least 2.5 billion pounds
($3.8 billion) a year, while ensuring banks contribute to
reflect the risks they pose to the financial system and economy,
according to the Treasury. Osborne cut  corporation tax  by 1
percentage point to 20 percent from April 2015, he said.  Gross domestic product will increase 0.6 percent this year,
compared with a previous forecast of 1.2 percent, Osborne said
as he delivered his annual budget statement today, citing the
 Office for Budget Responsibility ’s predictions.  -- Editor: Jon Menon  To contact the reporter on this story:
