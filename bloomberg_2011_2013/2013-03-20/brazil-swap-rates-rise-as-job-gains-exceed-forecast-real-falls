Brazil ’s swap rates climbed,
erasing declines, as employers created more jobs in February
than forecast, spurring speculation the central bank will
increase borrowing costs to contain inflation.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2016 rose for the
first time in five days, increasing two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 9.04 percent at 5:36 p.m. in Sao Paulo
after dropping five basis points. The real depreciated 0.2
percent to 1.9883 per U.S. dollar.  Employers added a net 123,446 jobs last month after a net
increase of 28,900 in January, the Labor Ministry reported at 3
p.m. in Brasilia. The median forecast of analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a net gain of 95,148.  The jobs report “was surprising, a lot stronger than the
market expected,” Paulo Nepomuceno, a fixed-income strategist
at Coinvalores CCVM in Sao Paulo, said in a telephone interview.  The swap rates dropped earlier after  Folha de S. Paulo 
reported that increases in borrowing costs will be decided by
the central bank, not the market, indicating that policy makers
will wait until May to lift  interest rates  from record lows
instead of a boost next month. The newspaper cited unidentified
government assistants; the central bank declined to comment when
reached by  Bloomberg News .  Minutes of the central bank’s March 5-6 meeting indicated
that an increase in the target lending rate from 7.25 percent
wasn’t imminent as policy makers said “a cautious management of
monetary policy” was needed. The monetary policy committee will
next meet April 16-17 and May 28-29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
