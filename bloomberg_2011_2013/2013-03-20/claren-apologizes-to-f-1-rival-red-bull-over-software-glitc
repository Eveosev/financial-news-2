McLaren apologized to Formula One
rival  Red Bull  after a software problem with an engine control
unit it supplies to all teams affected  Mark Webber  in the
season-opening Australian Grand Prix.  Webber qualified second on the grid alongside Red Bull
teammate Sebastian Vettel in  Melbourne  three days ago, though
the glitch contributed to him dropping to seventh by the end of
the opening lap. He finished his home race in sixth place.  “The electronic units themselves ran without incident in
Melbourne, but there was a software-related issue that meant
that Mark Webber’s car’s garage data system had to be re-started
during the formation lap,” a statement from the McLaren Group
read. “That disrupted his preparations for the start of the
race, for which Mark and the team has our apology. We are
working together with them to prevent any recurrence.”  McLaren Electronics Systems, a division of the McLaren
Group that also comprises the F-1 team, supplies standard engine
control units to all teams in the 2013 world championship. The
units act as a car’s primary data system.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
