A  shareholders’ meeting  to resolve
disputes that are holding up construction funding of Mongolia’s
$6.6 billion Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine is yet to be set,
Mining Minister Davaajav Gankhuyag said today.  Mongolia’s state-owned news agency Montsame reported on
March 14 that a meeting will take place on March 20, citing
Minister of Economic Development Nyamjav Batbayar.  The mine is currently operating on a month-to-month budget
with funds from  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , which owns 66 percent of the
project through its Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. unit. Mongolia
owns the rest.  Tax dues and cost overruns are among issues that remain in
dispute, Gankhuyag said at a press conference in Ulan Bator.  The government alleges that the project has gone 40 percent
over budget, while  Rio Tinto  says the figure is closer to 18
percent. Mongolia says it will only approve the 2013 budget when
it sees a complete feasibility study for phase two of the
project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
