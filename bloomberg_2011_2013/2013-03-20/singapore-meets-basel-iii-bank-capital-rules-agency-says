The  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  said Singapore successfully implemented an overhaul
of international bank-capital rules.  An assessment by regulators found that “Singapore’s
overall capital regime is in line with the requirements of the
Basel framework,” the group said in a statement on its website.  Any deviations from the so-called Basel III rules “were
not considered by the assessment team to be material,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
