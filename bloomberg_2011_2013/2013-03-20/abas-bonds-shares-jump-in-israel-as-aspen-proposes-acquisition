Habas H.Z. Investments (1960) (HBS)  bonds
rallied, sending the yield down the most on record, after
Israeli real estate investor  Aspen Group Ltd. (ASGR)  offered to buy
shares of the company and give bondholders stock.  The yield on the 180 million shekels ($49 million) of 5
percent notes due August 2018 slumped 601 basis points, or 6.01
percentage points, the most on record, to 46.95 percent at the
close in Tel Aviv. Shares of the Tel Aviv-based company, which
plunged 79 percent in the past 12 months, gained 9.3 percent to
1.072 shekels.  Israel ’s 4.25 percent benchmark 2023  government
bonds  yielded 4.03 percent, up two basis points.  Aspen proposed buying all Habas shares and offering debt
holders stock in the company, it said in a statement to the Tel
Aviv bourse today. Habas, which also develops real estate, said
this month there are “significant doubts” it will manage to
make debt payments in May and August.  “If Aspen’s offer goes through this would result in a more
liquid owner,” Jaap Kuin, an analyst at ING Bank NV in
Amsterdam, said by phone. “A more cash-rich owner may also help
strengthen NSI’s balance sheet.”  Habas attributed its repayment doubts to the drop in shares
of Hoorn Netherlands-based  Nieuwe Steen Investments NV (NISTI) , in which
it owns a 20.5 percent stake. That stock, down 44 percent in the
past year, rose 3.2 percent today. Nieuwe reported a third-
quarter loss of 30.1 million euros ($39 million) as a result of
property revaluations and portfolio writedowns.  Habas Family  Aspen, which has free cash flow of 170 million shekels, is
also offering Habas a credit line of 5 million euros, according
to today’s statement. The Habas family  controls  40 percent of
Habas, while 23 percent are owned by billionaire Ofer family.  The Tel-Bond 40 Index of corporate bonds rose for a second
day, advancing 0.1 percent to 284.15. One-year  interest-rate
swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates over the
period, increased less than one basis point to 1.60 percent.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government notes of
similar maturity, rose eight basis points to 265, implying an
average annual inflation rate of 2.65 percent over the period.  The shekel strengthened 0.4 percent to 3.6731 a dollar at
4:47 p.m. in  Tel Aviv , boosting the monthly appreciation to 1.1
percent, the third-best performer among 31 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
