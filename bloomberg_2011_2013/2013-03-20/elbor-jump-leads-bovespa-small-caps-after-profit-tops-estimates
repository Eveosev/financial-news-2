Helbor Empreendimentos SA (HBOR3) ,  Brazil ’s
cheapest homebuilder on a price-to-earnings basis, jumped the
most in a month after reporting profit that beat analysts’
estimates.  Shares rose 3.3 percent to 12.50 reais at 2:11 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, which would be the biggest advance on a closing basis
since Feb. 15. It was the best performer on the BM&FBovespa
Small Cap index, which slid 0.6 percent.  Earnings per share more than tripled in the fourth quarter
from the same period a year earlier to 1.044 reais, exceeding
the average estimate for 37 centavos among three analysts,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg after the company
released results late yesterday.  The results back up Helbor’s strategy to target faster
growing areas of the country as economic expansion stays
sluggish, Luiz Mauricio Garcia, an analyst at  Banco Bradesco
SA (BBDC4) ’s brokerage unit, wrote in a note to clients dated today.  Brazil’s gross domestic product growth slowed to 0.9
percent last year from 2.7 percent in 2011.  Helbor lost 3.6 percent this year through yesterday while
the small cap index declined 2.6 percent during that same
period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
