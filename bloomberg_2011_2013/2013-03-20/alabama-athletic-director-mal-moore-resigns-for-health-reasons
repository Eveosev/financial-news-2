University of  Alabama  Athletic
Director Mal Moore is leaving after more than 14 years in the
position because of undisclosed health problems.  Moore, 73, played football at Alabama under former coach
Paul “Bear” Bryant from 1958-62 and became an assistant coach
under Bryant after graduating from the school. Moore has been a
part of 10 national championship football teams as a player,
coach and athletic director, a role he assumed in 1999.  Moore’s resignation takes effect immediately and he becomes
a special assistant to Alabama President Judy Bonner, the school
said in a  statement .  “I am at a point that I can no longer fulfill my duties as
athletics director in the true championship manner the position
requires,” Moore said. “While I have to focus on my health
issue, I look forward to maintaining an ongoing working
relationship with this great university.”  Alabama’s football program has won three national titles in
the past four years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
