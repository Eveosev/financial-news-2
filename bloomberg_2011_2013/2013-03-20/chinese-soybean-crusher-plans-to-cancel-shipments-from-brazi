Shandong Chenxi Group Co., a
Chinese soybean crusher and trader, said it plans to cancel
orders for almost 2 million metric tons of Brazilian cargoes
because of shipment delays.  The company ordered about 10 cargoes of Brazilian soybeans
to be delivered in February and March yet only two have arrived,
Shao Guorui, general manager for oilseeds at the company in
northern  China â€™s Shandong province, said by telephone today.  Chenxi may cancel about 30 cargoes, which are scheduled to
be delivered by July, he said. It may also buy soybeans from
domestic ports or reorder cheaper supplies from  Argentina , Shao
said.  Reuters earlier reported the plans to cancel the shipments.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: William Bi in
