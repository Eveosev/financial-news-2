BlackBerry (BBRY)  rose 6.5 percent after
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  analyst  Ehud Gelblum  raised his rating on the
stock to the equivalent of buy, saying the new BlackBerry 10
smartphone lineup will boost profit margins.  The stock climbed to $16 in  New York , reaching the highest
price in more than a month. Shares of the Waterloo, Ontario-
based company have increased 35 percent this year.  As existing users upgrade to newer phones, it should
“meaningfully” drive up profitability and the average selling
price for a BlackBerry, two key benchmarks for the company,
Gelblum said today in a note. He estimates that gross margin --
the percentage of sales left after production costs -- reached
33 percent in February, up from 31.6 percent in November.  BlackBerry, formerly known as  Research In Motion Ltd. (BB) , is
counting on the new Z10 and Q10 phones to regain market share
after years of losing ground to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iOS  and Google
Inc.’s Android platform. Android, used by Samsung Electronics
Co., and iOS together accounted for 91 percent of global
smartphone sales in the fourth quarter, according to IDC.
BlackBerry’s share dropped to 3.2 percent.  Gelblum, who is based in New York, raised his rating to
overweight from underweight and boosted his target price to $22
from $10. Still, the probability that BB10 emerges as a
“viable” third operating system remains small, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
