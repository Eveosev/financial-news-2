Serbia and the  European Aeronautic
Defence & Space Co. (EAD) , the parent of Airbus SAS, are in talks on
the lease of four aircraft as national carrier JAT Airways AD
revamps its fleet.  Serbia is looking for a “newer generation of aircraft,”
the Serbian Transportation Ministry in Belgrade said in an e-
mailed statement. “Talks have begun with Airbus on firming up
the lease of four aircraft” to upgrade the fleet. It gave no
further details.  The government said Nov. 6 it wants to buy four 180-
passenger aircraft and lease eight more planes for JAT. Prime
Minister Ivica Dacic is expected to hold talks on the purchase
next month when he travels to Paris for an official visit to
meet French Premier Jean-Marc Ayrault, according to the
statement.  Serbia made an advance payment of about $23.5 million to
Airbus more than a decade ago for a purchase of eight planes
before canceling the order. The government wants to include that
amount in talks for the new planes with Toulouse, France-based
Airbus.  The Balkan country is considering selling JAT to Etihad
Airways PJSC, the third-biggest Gulf airline, Finance Minister
Mladjan Dinkic said Oct. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
