Ethanol weakened against gasoline
by the most in three weeks after the motor fuel rallied and as
the biofuel fell on higher output.  The spread widened 9.12 cents to 53.13 cents a gallon, the
most since March 1, after gasoline surged. Ethanol declined
after  production  of the biofuel rose 1.5 percent to 809,000
barrels a day in the week ended March 15, the first gain in
three weeks, the Energy Information Administration said today.  “The market finally got that bounce in production,”
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago , said by
telephone. “I would think of this as a relief selloff.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery dropped 2 cents, or
0.8 percent, to $2.585 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, a
one-week low.  Gasoline futures for April delivery jumped 7.12 cents, or
2.3 percent, to settle at $3.1163 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  Corn for May delivery gained 4 cents to $7.325 a bushel in
Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, widened to
minus 11 cents a gallon from minus 8 cents. The amount doesn’t
include revenue from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a
byproduct of ethanol production, which can be fed to livestock.  Valero Start  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest U.S. ethanol
producer, restored operations at a plant in Bloomingburg,  Ohio ,
and plans to restart a mill in Linden,  Indiana . At least 19
ethanol plants have been idled since June as companies curbed
output because of Midwestern drought, according to the  Renewable
Fuels Association  in  Washington .  “You’re seeing the margins for plants in the Midwest
improve enough to get some of those back online,”  Jason Ward ,
an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Inc. in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview.  The U.S. imported ethanol for the first time in three
weeks,  bringing in  27,000 barrels a day last week, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm said in the report. Brazil, which
uses sugarcane to make the fuel, is the largest supplier of
ethanol to the U.S.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  sold for $2.37 a gallon last
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In U.S. cash market trading, ethanol slipped 3.5 cents to
$2.61 a gallon in Chicago, 3 cents to $2.67 on the  Gulf Coast ,
and 2.5 cents to $2.73 in New York. The biofuel rose 1 cent to
$2.875 on the West Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stockpiles Slip  Stockpiles of the U.S. biofuel slid 1.2 percent to 18.5
million barrels last week, a seventh weekly drop, the EIA said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 95 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, up from 93 percent the
previous week, the report showed.  Refiners must blend 13.8 billion gallons of ethanol, or
900,000 barrels a day, this year and 14.4 billion next year,
according to a U.S. biofuels law.  Ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers fell 8 cents, or
10 percent, to 69 cents yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The certificates peaked March 8 at $1.06. RINs are
assigned to each gallon of fuel introduced the market, then
submitted by refiners to the Environmental Protection Agency to
show compliance with the law.  Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, fell 9 cents, or 11 percent, to 74
cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
