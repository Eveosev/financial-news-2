Peru ’s benchmark borrowing costs in
dollars dropped from the highest level in seven months as the
 Federal Reserve  pledged to maintain U.S. monetary stimulus,
spurring demand for higher-yielding assets.  The  extra yield  investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 145 basis points at 3:59 p.m. in Lima,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The gap was 152 yesterday, the
highest since July 26.  The Fed said it will keep up its bond buying at a pace of
$85 billion a month and hold its target interest rate near zero.
Unemployment remains high while inflation is relatively low, Fed
Chairman  Ben Bernanke  said.  “The Fed statement and Bernanke’s speech offered further
reassurance that the Fed will remain accommodative for quite
some time,” said Bret Rosen, a Latin America strategist at
Standard Chartered Bank in New York.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.5910 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to prices from Datatec. Peru’s central bank said on
its website that it bought $40 million in the foreign-exchange
market today, paying an average 2.5931 soles per dollar.  The central bank is in favor of relaxing the limit on
private pension funds’ investments abroad, bank President Julio Velarde told reporters in Lima. Policy makers on Feb. 15
increased the limit on the funds’ foreign portfolio to 34
percent from 32 percent as part of measures designed to curb the
sol’s rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
