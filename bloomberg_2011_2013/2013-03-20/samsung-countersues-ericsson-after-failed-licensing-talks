Samsung Electronics Co. countersued
Ericsson AB for patent infringement, claiming it unlawfully used
the South Korean phone maker’s technology and breached an
agreement.  Asia ’s biggest technology company is asking that Ericsson’s
lawsuit against it for alleged patent violations be thrown out
as the claims are invalid, according to papers filed March 18 in
 U.S. federal court  in  Texas .  Ericsson, the world’s largest maker of wireless networking
equipment, sued Samsung in November after failing to extend a
licensing deal after years of negotiations. The two companies
have also filed complaints against each other with the
International Trade Commission over alleged patent
infringements.  “Over the course of two years of negotiations between the
parties, Ericsson has engaged in a pervasive and pernicious
pattern of refusing to grant licenses to Samsung on fair,
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms,” Samsung said in its
filing.  Stockholm-based Ericsson had said in its lawsuit that it
offered to extend its previous licensing agreement with Samsung
on such terms and the Suwon, South Korea-based company refused.  The case is Ericsson Inc. v  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  Ltd.
