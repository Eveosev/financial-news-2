CEZ AS (CEZ)  rose from its lowest level
in more than seven years after the biggest Czech power utility
said it will probably exceed its profit estimate this year and
as the price of electricity increased from a record low.  The stock rose as much as 1.3 percent and ended the day up
0.1 percent at 564.50 koruna with share turnover at 145 percent
of the three-month daily average. CEZ tumbled 17 percent this
month through yesterday to the weakest since August 2005.  CEZ said yesterday it signed a deal with Czech Coal to fuel
its Pocerady power plant, which will boost 2013 operating profit
by 1.5 billion koruna ($76 million) to 2 billion koruna and may
help the utility top its earnings targets. The company also said
it agreed to sell its Chvaletice plant to Litvinovska Uhelna AS
for 4.1 billion koruna, a transaction that will add about 2
billion koruna to its net income.  “This one-time profit could have a positive impact on the
dividend to be paid next year,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at
 Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in  Prague , wrote in a report to clients today.  CEZ will probably pay 45 koruna a share this year, the same
amount as in 2012, according to analyst  forecasts  compiled by
Bloomberg. The Prague-based company cut the payout from 50
koruna in 2011 and 53 koruna in 2010 as falling electricity
prices dented profits.  Relative Strength  Power for next-year delivery in  Germany , where CEZ exports
part of its output, bounced from a record low today, rising 0.4
percent to 40.40 euros per megawatt-hour. Low electricity prices
may hurt the company’s earnings in 2014, Chief Executive Officer
Martin Novak said in a Feb. 1 interview with  Bloomberg News .  CEZ shares’ previous decline sent their 14-day relative
strength index, or RSI, down to 27 yesterday, below the 30 level
suggesting in technical analysis that the asset may be oversold
and set to rebound. The RSI increased to 28 today.  The yield on CEZ’s euro-denominated bonds maturing in April
2025 retreated 4 basis point, or 0.04 percentage point, to a
record low of 2.67 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
