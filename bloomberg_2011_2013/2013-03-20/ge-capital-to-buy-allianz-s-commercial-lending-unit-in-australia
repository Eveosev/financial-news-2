General Electric Co. (GE) ’s finance unit
agreed to buy an Australian commercial lending subsidiary of
 Allianz SE (ALV)  for an undisclosed amount.  GE Capital will acquire Allianz Finance Pty, which has a
loan book of A$400 million ($415 million) and lends to companies
with annual revenue of A$10 million to A$250 million, GE said in
an e-mailed statement.  GE Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  is making inroads
on his pledge to shrink GE Capital’s balance sheet and reduce
its contribution to earnings. The unit’s ending net investment,
a measure of its assets, fell to $419 billion as of Dec. 31, an
18 percent decline since January 2009.  “GE Capital already has relationships with one in four
mid-market companies in Australia,” said Aaron Baxter, GE
Capital’s head of commercial finance in Australia. “The
acquisition of the Allianz Finance business allows us to deliver
on our strategy of growing our commercial finance offering to
this segment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
