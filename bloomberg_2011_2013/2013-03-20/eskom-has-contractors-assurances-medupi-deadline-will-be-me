Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., which
supplies 95 percent of  South Africa ’s power, says it has
guarantees from two contractors that its 91.2 billion rand ($9.8
billion) Medupi plant will be operational by the end of the
year.  Hitachi Kaefer and  Alstom SA (ALO)  gave the state-owned power
utility “assurances in writing that they will deliver in time
to enable the December deadline to be met,” spokeswoman Hilary
Joffe said in an e-mailed response to questions today. “We are
doing our utmost as Eskom to make the December date for first
synchronization to the grid,” she said.  The 4,800 megawatt plant, which is grappling with strikes
and faults, is being built to alleviate power shortages in
 Africa ’s biggest economy that led to blackouts and halted mines
for at least five days in January 2008.  “We have asked contractors for mitigation plans,” Joffe
said.  Paul O’Flaherty, Eskom’s finance director and head of group
capital, will be ’’spending more time’’ at the site as requested
by the board and the chief executive, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
