Yields on Polish  government bonds 
rose for a third day after the  Finance Ministry  sold more bonds
than it planned at an auction amid investor concern over how the
euro area will cope with problems caused by Cyprus.  The yield on  five-year bonds  climbed five basis points to
3.485 percent, the highest in more than a week, at 2:52 p.m. in
Warsaw after  Poland  sold 8.08 billion zloty in bonds due in 2015
and 2018. The target had been 6 billion zloty.  “It is not an easy market,” Esther Law, a strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  London , said in e-mailed comments today.
“External factors are very uncertain and it’s difficult to know
what’s going to happen at their next auction. If they can place
as much as they can in the short end, why not?”  The ministry sold 5.03 billion zloty in bonds due in April
2018, which were priced to yield 3.432 percent, a record low for
a government auction, with demand at 5.63 billion zloty. It also
sold 3.05 billion zloty of notes maturing in July 2015 with the
yield at 3.456 percent, also a record low.  The auction confirmed Poland’s position as a “regional
safe haven,”  Piotr Marczak , head of the Finance Ministry’s
public debt department, said in an e-mailed statement.  The zloty appreciated as much as 0.4 percent before the
auction as the  European Central Bank  pledged to provide
liquidity to Cyprus, giving it time to renegotiate a financial
rescue package. The currency last traded less than 0.1 percent
stronger at 4.1635 per euro, after weakening 0.5 percent in the
previous two days on concern that Cyprus’s bailout plan may
trigger a return in the euro region’s crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
