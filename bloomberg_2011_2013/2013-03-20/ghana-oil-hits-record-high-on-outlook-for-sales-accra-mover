Ghana Oil Co. (GOIL) , the second-biggest
operator of fuel stations in the West African nation, reached a
record high as sales of new engine lubricants boost revenue
outlook, according to African Alliance Securities Ltd.  The stock gained 2.1 percent to 99 pesewas by the 3 p.m.
close in Accra, the highest since November 2007 when Bloomberg
began compiling the data. More than 16,000 shares traded, or
about 85 percent of the three-month daily average volume.  “The products are very specific, targeting different
groups of vehicle users,” Derrick Mensah, a stock analyst at
African Alliance, said by phone from Accra. Goil, as the company
is known, is “leveraging on its wide network of fuel stations.
I expect the products to impact positively on revenue this
year,” he said.  The company started promotional campaigns for the products
that are targeted mainly at commercial-vehicle drivers,
spokesman Cyril Oppong said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
