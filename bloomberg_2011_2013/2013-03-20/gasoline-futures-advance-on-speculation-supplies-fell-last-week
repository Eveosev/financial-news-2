Gasoline futures advanced,
reversing an earlier decline to the lowest level in almost three
weeks. Crack spreads widened.  Prices gained 2.3 percent after falling to $3.0203 a gallon
when the Energy Information Administration reported that
refiners  processed  the most oil in two months in the seven days
ended March 15. The April crack spread versus WTI widened $2.19
to $37.92 a barrel after touching $34.62 at 10:53 a.m. after the
EIA report was released.  “We put in the bottom 20 minutes after the report. We have
been rallying off of that,”  Stephen Schork , the president of
Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , said by phone.
“It might be you’ve got some people coming in and swooping in
and buying up the cracks on that initial sell-off from the
report.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 7.12 cents to settle at
$3.1163 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on trading

produce more summer-grade gasoline,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil
market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company in
 London .  Supplies of  distillates , including heating oil and diesel,
fell 672,000 barrels to 119.8 million, the lowest level in three
