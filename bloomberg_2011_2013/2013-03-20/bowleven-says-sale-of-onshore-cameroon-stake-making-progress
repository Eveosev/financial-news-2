BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , a U.K. oil explorer
in Cameroon, said it’s getting closer to selling a 50 percent
stake in its Bomono permit.  The company has been in talks with a national  oil company 
for about nine months, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Hart said
today in a telephone interview. BowLeven, which currently owns
100 percent of the license, opened up discussions with other
parties when negotiations stalled, though they’re now back on
track, he said.  “It’s been a protracted experience,” Hart said. “It’s
taken longer than we’d hoped, but I think we’ll get there in the
end.”  BowLeven said it had cash of $65 million at the end of
February and is fully funded through to a final  investment
decision  on the fertilizer plant that the Scottish explorer
plans to provide gas for from 2016. That decision should come by
the end of the year, Hart said.  “We’re slowly putting together the jigsaw to get to
project sanction,” Hart said. “We’re in a good position to
move forward with the development.”  BowLeven rose 5 percent to 100 pence, the highest in almost
a year. The shares reversed earlier losses of as much as 7.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
