Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
second-biggest mining company, set up a joint venture with
 Mozambique  Mining Exploration Co. to explore for coal in the
country’s Tete province.  The Changara Mines venture will be 75 percent-held by a
unit of Rio and the rest by Mozambique Mining, London-based Rio
said in a statement. Rio will transfer three exploration
licenses to the venture, it said.  “We want to develop a global competitive coal industry to
contribute to Mozambique’s prosperity,” Eric Finlayson, Rio’s
local director, said in the statement yesterday. The U.K.
company will fund the prospecting and research, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
