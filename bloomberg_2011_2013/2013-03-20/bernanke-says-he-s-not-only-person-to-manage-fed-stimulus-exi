Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said he doesn’t see himself as the only person
qualified to lead the U.S. central bank in the years ahead,
adding that he has briefly discussed his future plans with
President Barack Obama.  “I have spoken to the president a bit but I really don’t
have any information for you at this juncture,” Bernanke, 59,
said in response to a question at a press conference today at
the Fed headquarters in  Washington . “I don’t think I’m the only
person in the world who can manage the exit” from the central
bank’s record stimulus.  Bernanke’s second term as Fed chairman expires in January
2014. He said at a Dec. 12 news conference that he was
“very much engaged in the difficult issues that we’re
discussing‘‘ and that he had ‘‘not been spending time thinking
about’’ his future.  ‘‘One of the things that I hoped to accomplish and was not
entirely successful at’’ was ‘‘to try to depersonalize to some
extent monetary policy,’’ Bernanke added today.  Bernanke took over as Fed chief in 2006 after being
appointed by President George W. Bush, a Republican. He started
a second term in 2010 after being re-appointed by President
 Barack Obama , a Democrat.  Bernanke also served as Fed Board governor from 2002 to
2005, when he left to take the position as chairman of President
Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
