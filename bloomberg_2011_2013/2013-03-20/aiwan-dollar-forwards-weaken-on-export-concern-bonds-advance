Taiwan dollar  forwards fell to a
one-month low before a government report that is forecast to
show export orders shrank last month as demand cooled in  China ,
the No. 1 destination for the island’s shipments. Bonds gained.  Overseas orders probably fell 3 percent in February from a
year earlier, compared with an 18 percent gain in January,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
China’s  imports  slumped 15.2 percent in February, the most since
January 2012, according to a March 8 report.  “The key market to monitor is China where economic
stimulus has been weaker than expected, which should have some
downside impact on demand,” said Andrew Tsai, an economist at
KGI Securities Co. in Taipei. “I expect the Taiwan dollar to be
on a depreciation trend in the short term.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.1 percent to
NT$29.766 per dollar as of 9:37 a.m. in  Hong Kong , the lowest
since Feb. 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
local dollar was 0.1 percent stronger at NT$29.772, according to
prices from Taipei Forex Inc.  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a gauge
of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.48
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on the 1.125 percent government bonds due March
2023 dropped two basis points to 1.311 percent, according to
Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank lending  rate
was steady at 0.388 percent, a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
