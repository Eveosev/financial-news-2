JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, is making it easier for customers to fight payday-
lending abuses.  JPMorgan will stop processing multiple requests for payment
on checks that have already been returned due to insufficient
funds when payday lenders and other billers are suspected of
seeking “inappropriate payments,” the New York-based company
said today in a statement.  The change, which takes effect in May, “is intended to
address payday lenders and others who present repeated payments
to customers that are not in the spirit of their signed
agreement with the customer,” JPMorgan said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
