The yield on India’s 2022 bonds
rose to the highest level in almost six weeks after the central
bank said yesterday the room for more interest-rate cuts is
“quite limited.”  The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered its  repurchase rate  to
7.50 percent from 7.75 percent yesterday, and said high food
costs are “exacerbating the challenge for monetary management
in anchoring inflationary expectations.” Wholesale-price
inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 6.84 percent in February
from a year earlier, while  consumer prices  rose 10.91 percent.
Yields may drop as the monetary authority announced it will buy
debt this week, according to Barclays Plc.  “There may be no more rate cuts immediately as the RBI
will wait for confirmation that inflation is easing,” said
Philippe Petit, a Singapore-based senior investment manager at
Pictet Asset Management SA, which oversees $29 billion of
emerging-market debt. “Any bond rally from here will not be
massive.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.92 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s
the highest since Feb. 5.  The RBI will buy a maximum 100 billion rupees ($1.8
billion) of bonds maturing 2014, 2016, 2017 and 2026 on March
22, it said in a statement after the market closed yesterday.
The central bank will continue to use measures such as open-
market operations to manage cash conditions, it said.  Foreign Purchases  India  will auction 162.4 billion rupees of debt-purchase
quotas to foreign investors today, according to a notification
on the capital markets regulator’s website. Overseas funds
should look to buy the debt, Barclays recommended in a research
note today, predicting inflation and growth will warrant a 50
basis point reduction in the policy rate by mid-2013.  Gross domestic product in  Asia ’s third-largest economy rose
4.5 percent in the last quarter of 2012, the slowest pace since
2009, and the government forecasts an annual growth rate of
about 5 percent, the least in a decade.  “Inflation remains at a level which is not conducive for
sustained economic growth,” RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said
in a statement yesterday. “Accordingly, even as the policy
stance emphasizes addressing the growth risks, the headroom for
further monetary easing remains quite limited.”  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.54 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
