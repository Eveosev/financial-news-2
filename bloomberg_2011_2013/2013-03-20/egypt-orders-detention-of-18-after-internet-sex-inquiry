Egyptian prosecutors ordered the
detention of 17 women and a Lebanese man pending investigations
into allegations of using the Internet for commercial phone sex.  The suspects were ordered detained for four days after
security forces raided a company office they use and confiscated
phones and computer devices there, according to a statement from
the Giza security directorate. The owner of the company, an
American of Lebanese descent who is not among those arrested,
lives in Lebanon and owns satellite channels that he uses to
encourage calls to international numbers used for sex chats, it
alleged.  Investigations showed “gang members” recruited female
university students through job ads in newspapers and then
agreed with them to perform acts “that run contrary to
morality,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
