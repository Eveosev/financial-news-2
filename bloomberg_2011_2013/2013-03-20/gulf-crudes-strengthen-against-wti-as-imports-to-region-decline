Gulf Coast crudes strengthened
against domestic benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate after a
government report showed reduced imports to the region.  Oil  imports to the PADD 3 region , which includes the Gulf
Coast, fell by 129,000 barrels to 3.3 million in the week ended
March 15, according to a report by the Energy Information
Administration, the statistics arm of the Energy Department.  Gulf Coast crudes Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet increased their premiums to WTI. LLS gained $1 to $23.25 a
barrel and HLS 85 cents to $24.10 at 2:05 p.m. New York time,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Other domestic oils also strengthened. Poseidon’s premium
gained 60 cents to $19 a barrel and Mars Blend 60 cents to
$18.85. Thunder Horse gained 75 cents to a $21 premium and
Southern Green Canyon was unchanged at $15.25 above WTI.  In Texas’s Permian Basin, WTI Midland weakened by 20 cents
to trade at a 45-cent discount to the same grade delivered to
the U.S. supply hub in Cushing,  Oklahoma .  Refiners neared the end of maintenance season after planned
turnarounds between January and March took 1.13 million barrels
a day of crude processing capacity offline, according to IIR
Energy, a Sugar Land, Texas-based energy-information provider.
From April to June, that figure will drop to 676,000 barrels.  Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Wood River,  Illinois ,  refinery  returned a
120,000-barrel-a-day crude unit to full rates, and plans to
return a 150,000-barrel-a-day unit within a week, said a person
familiar with the matter on Mar. 18.  On the Gulf Coast,  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Port Arthur,
Texas,  refinery  restarted its 57,000-barrel-a-day hydrocracker
over the weekend after it had been shut since March 7 for
repairs, a spokesman said by e-mail Mar. 18.  Canadian crudes Western Canada Select narrowed the discount
to WTI by $2 to $18 a barrel. Syncrude weakened 25 cents to a $6
premium. Index trading for April delivery for the grades ended
on March 15. Most of the volume in Canadian grades is traded
during the index period, which begins on the first of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
