Argentina’s President  Cristina
Fernandez de Kirchner  introduced the following controls since
her re-election in October 2011 to stem capital outflows and
shore up central bank reserves.  Some dates are approximate and are subject to revision as
more information becomes available. The list starts with the
latest measures and ends with the first.  2013:  March 18: Argentina increases a tax on credit- and debit-card
purchases made abroad and on foreign shopping by Internet to 20
percent from 15 percent. The tax agency extends the tax to
purchases of tickets for international travel and package tours,
and to the payment of foreign services such as hotel
accommodation, restaurant dining and car hire.  March 14: Central bank restricts the use of credit and debit
cards for placing bets abroad.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Feb. 22: Capital outflows fell 84 percent in 2012 to the lowest
since 2006 after Fernandez tightened currency controls.  The  central bank  said outflows totaled $3.4 billion in 2012
after $21.5 billion left the country in 2011. The economy
received a net inflow of $163 million in the fourth quarter, the
second consecutive quarterly inflow.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  2012:  Sept. 6: Central bank revokes authorizations for private banks
and exchange houses to operate in the country’s airports and
ports. The measure was taken to protect tourists from
“abusive” practices such as using unfair exchange rates, the
bank said.  Sept. 3: The tax agency extends the 15 percent tax advance on
credit-card purchases made abroad to include debit cards and to
international Internet purchases using credit cards.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Aug. 30: Tax agency Director Ricardo Echegaray tells credit-card
companies to add a 15 percent tax advance to all purchases their
clients make abroad. The tax agency will review credit-card
statements to check if travelers exceed the $300 duty-free
allowance on goods brought into the country.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  July 17: The government extends the time allowed for some mining
companies to repatriate export revenue to as many as 180 days.
The government also extends the deadline for laboratories and
agriculture companies to repatriate export revenue.  July 5: The central bank issues a list of acceptable reasons to
justify foreign currency purchases. The list doesn’t include
savings nor future purchases of real estate. All dollar
purchases for any reason other than those on the list are
“suspended,” the bank says.  Individuals are allowed to buy a limited amount of dollars
for purposes including foreign travel, mortgage payments and to
send to family members traveling abroad who run out of money.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  June 8: The central bank suspends the minimum reserve
requirement on dollar deposits for two months as savers withdraw
the U.S. currency from bank accounts.  June 6: President Fernandez says she’s switching her savings
into pesos from dollars and urged aides to do the same.
Fernandez says she would convert money she invests in fixed-term
dollar deposits to pesos because “it’s more profitable.”  ----------------------------------------------------------------  May 28:  Argentina  further tightens control of the exchange
market, requiring residents who want to buy foreign currency for
travel abroad to provide details of the trip to the tax agency.  May 18: The central bank announces capital outflows slowed in
the first quarter due to the tighter controls on the exchange
market. Investors withdrew $1.6 billion, compared with $3.3
billion in the fourth quarter of 2011.  May 15: The tax agency tightens rules to clamp down on foreign-
exchange trading outside the regulated market. The agency said
it will monitor more closely people who buy U.S. dollars in the
official market and then sell them in the unregulated market to
profit from the higher price for dollars paid by dealers outside
official channels.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  April 1: The central bank limits dollar withdrawals from cash
machines overseas to individuals who have dollar-denominated
accounts. The move prevents Argentines who only have peso
accounts from fueling capital flight by withdrawing dollars at
cash machines while they are abroad.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  March 22: The Senate approves changes to the central bank’s
charter to allow the government unlimited use of the bank’s
international reserves to pay debt. The changes also enable the
institution to boost loans to the government to help cover a
widening budget deficit.  March 14: The government tells  oil companies  to boost output to
help cut imports. Subsequently, YPF SA, the country’s largest
oil company, loses 12 licenses in five provinces.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Feb. 17: The central bank reports capital flight slowed from a
record pace in the fourth quarter. Investors withdrew $3.3
billion from  South America ’s second-biggest economy in the
October-through-December period, down from $8.4 billion in the
previous quarter.  Feb. 1: Argentina tightens controls on imports, prompting
complaints from  Brazil , the country’s main trade partner.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Jan. 26: The central bank increases from Feb. 1 capital
requirements for banks that distribute payments to shareholders
to 75 percent more than the minimum required for financial
institutions from 35 percent previously.  ---------------------------------------------------------------
-2011:  Dec. 22: The Senate approves an anti-terrorism law that states
the buying or selling of foreign currencies outside the official
market may be considered an act of terrorism. Prison sentences
of as long as eight years can be imposed for “conduct that
affects the economic and financial order.”  Dec. 1: The central bank reports that capital flight accelerated
to the fastest pace in at least four years in the third quarter
as investors concerned about inflation and a weakening peso
pulled cash out of the country.  Capital flight totaled $8.4 billion in the July-to-
September period compared with $6.1 billion the previous
quarter. Outflows rose to $18 billion in the first nine months
of 2011 from $9.2 billion a year earlier. ----------------------
------------------------------------------  Nov. 3: The government’s representative on the board of YPF SA
votes against a 2.81 billion peso dividend to shareholders,
including controlling company  Spain ’s Repsol.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  Oct. 31: Individuals and companies are required to obtain
authorization from the federal tax agency before purchasing
foreign currency.  Oct. 27: The central bank sets new rules requiring foreign
investors to register currency inflows tied to investments in
property and other local assets. Those who fail to register
funds brought into the country will need to seek the central
bank’s permission before they can repatriate any proceeds.  Oct. 26: Argentina orders oil, gas and mining companies such as
Xstrata Plc, Total SA, Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Pan American
Energy LLC to repatriate all future export revenue.  Fernandez also orders insurance companies to bring back all
investments and funds held abroad.  Oct. 25:  Tax agency officials visit  Buenos Aires  exchange
houses, ordering customers who are seeking to buy as little as
$100 to fill out currency exchange forms and provide
identification and proof of income. Jose Sbattella, head of
Argentina’s anti-money laundering agency, says the government is
trying to crack down on investors who use other people to buy
dollars for them.  Oct. 23: Fernandez is re-elected with 54 percent of votes, the
most obtained by a presidential candidate since Juan Domingo
Peron in 1973.  To contact the reporter on this story:
