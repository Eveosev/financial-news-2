Peregrine Financial Group Inc.’s
Chapter 7 trustee won court approval to create three classes of
firm commodity customers, a ruling that he said may lead to full
repayment for one class of account holders.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Carol A. Doyle in  Chicago  today
approved trustee Ira Bodenstein’s request to divide account
holders based on who traded on U.S. commodity exchanges, who
traded on exchanges outside the country, and who holds warehouse
receipts for taking or making delivery under commodity
contracts.  That division may enable customers who traded on foreign
commodities exchanges to be repaid in full, Bodenstein said
after the hearing.  “We anticipate that they’ll get close to all their
money,” Bodenstein said. There may even be a surplus, he said.  Peregrine, a Cedar Falls, Iowa-based commodities firm with
offices in Chicago, filed to liquidate in July after the
 National Futures Association  said more than $200 million in
customer funds were missing.  Firm founder Russell Wasendorf Sr., who is now serving a
50-year federal prison sentence for fraud and embezzlement,
stole mostly from customers who traded on U.S. exchanges, the
trustee said.  Doyle in September approved Bodenstein’s request to make a
$123 million interim payout to account holders.  The case is In re Peregrine Financial Group Inc., 12-
bk-27488,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Northern District of  Illinois 
(Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
