Euro-area  consumer confidence 
increased less than economists forecast in March amid signs the
economy is struggling to pull out of a recession.  An index of household confidence in the currency bloc rose
to minus 23.5 from minus 23.6 in February, the European
Commission in Brussels said in an initial estimate today.
Economists had forecast minus 23.2, according to the median of
26 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey .  The 17-nation currency blocâ€™s economy recorded a decline of
0.6 percent in the fourth quarter, the worst performance since
2009. The negative trend will continue in the first three months
of 2013, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The
European Commission sees the economy shrinking 0.3 percent this
year after a 0.5 percent contraction in 2012. Euro-area
unemployment rose to 11.9 percent in January from a revised 11.8
percent in December.  The commission is scheduled to publish the final numbers
for March  consumer confidence  and the wider indicator of euro-
area economic confidence on March 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
