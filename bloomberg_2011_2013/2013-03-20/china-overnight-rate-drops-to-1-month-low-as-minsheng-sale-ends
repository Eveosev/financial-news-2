China’s overnight money-market rate
fell to a one-month low as China Minsheng Banking Corp.’s
convertible bond sale ended, releasing funds from unsuccessful
bidders back into the financial system.  The Beijing-based lender raised 20 billion  yuan  ($3.2
billion) from the offering, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Guotai Junan Securities Co. estimates the issuance had locked up
450 billion yuan of capital, and excess funds are being returned
starting today. The Ministry of Finance sold 22 billion yuan of
10-year notes today at 3.5198 percent, according to a trader at
a  finance company  that participates in government debt auctions.  “Liquidity is released after the Minsheng bond sale,”
said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants
Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender. “But liquidity was
quite loose to begin with. The repo rate will stay around the
current level in the next one to two months.”  The one-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 2.05 percent as of 10:57 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It touched 2 percent earlier, the
lowest level since Feb. 21.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, was unchanged at 3.27
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.91 percent government bonds due April
2015 rose one basis point to 3.09 percent, according to the
Interbank Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
