Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili’s party said it’s ready to back constitutional
changes to curtail his powers as demanded by Premier Bidzina Ivanishvili’s ruling coalition, easing political tensions.  Saakashvili’s United National Movement also proposed a non-
binding test vote before the official poll tomorrow to determine
whether Ivanishvili’s Georgian Dream has enough votes to pass
the proposal, Davit Bakradze, a lawmaker for the president’s
party, said in a televised speech on Rustavi 2 late yesterday.  The proposed constitutional changes that would abolish
Saakashvili’s right to fire the Cabinet have soured relations
between the two political forces since Ivanishvili’s coalition
unexpectedly won elections last October. Saakashvili has said
repeatedly that he had no intention of using that power.  Georgian Dream needs at least 100 votes to pass the
amendments. It holds 83 lawmakers, while Saakashvili’s party has
54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
