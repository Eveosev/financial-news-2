Panamanian firefighters struggled
to bring a fire under control at the Central American nation’s
largest landfill site, prompting health warnings as clouds of
smoke blanketed the capital,  Panama  City.  The fire started in the Cerro Patacon municipal dump at
about 6:30 p.m. yesterday and may take three days to put out,
Panama America newspaper reported, citing Angel Delgado, a
spokesman for the fire department.  Those living by the dump, situated near a national park
about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) outside the city, should avoid
inhaling the smoke, Panama’s civil defense agency said on its
twitter account today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
