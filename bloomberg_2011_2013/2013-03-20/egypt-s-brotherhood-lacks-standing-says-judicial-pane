A top Egyptian judicial advisory
body said the Muslim Brotherhood, the country’s biggest Islamist
organization and President Mohamed Mursi’s backer, has no legal
standing.  The non-binding report by the judicial panel today comes
ahead of a ruling by an administrative court due later this
month on lawsuits demanding the organization be disbanded.  Tensions between  Egypt ’s Islamists and the judiciary
escalated after Mursi’s Nov. 22 decree expanding his powers,
which paved the way for the passage of an Islamist-backed
constitution amid opposition from secularists. The Brotherhood’s
legal status has been in dispute for decades, and the group was
banned under  Hosni Mubarak , who was ousted in 2011.  The timing of the recommendation is “sensitive” and
“raises questions,” Ahmed Aref, a spokesman for the
Brotherhood said by phone, adding the organization was working
on changing its legal status. “We are ready for any court
decision,” he said.  A ruling by the court against the Brotherhood would raise
questions about Mursi’s legitimacy and that of the Brotherhood’s
political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, which won Egypt’s
first post-Mubarak parliamentary election, said Khalil al-Anani,
a political scientist at Durham University in the U.K.  To contact the reporters on this story:
