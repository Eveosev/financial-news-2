Italy’s cereal-import costs
declined 12 percent last year on lower wheat purchases, industry
group Associazione Nazionale Cerealisti said.  Grain and cereal-product imports fell to 10.7 million
metric tons costing 3.19 billion euros ($4.1 billion) from 12.8
million tons and 3.60 billion euros in 2011, Anacer, as the
organization is known, wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Italy is  Europe ’s largest wheat importer, trade figures
show. Italians on average eat about 144 kilograms (317 pounds)
of wheat per capita annually, the most of any Western country,
the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization says.  The country’s soft-wheat imports declined to 4.19 million
tons costing 1.03 billion euros last year from 5.10 million tons
bought for 1.25 billion euros in 2011, Rome-based Anacer said.
Buying of durum wheat, the hard variety used to make pasta, slid
to 1.54 million tons for an import bill of 470 million euros,
from 2.26 million tons and 643 million euros.  Corn purchases fell to 2.65 million tons from 2.68 million
tons, while the value of shipments increased to 640 million
euros from 623 million euros, according to Anacer.  Including spending on oilseed and protein-crop products,
the value of imports dropped to 4.85 billion euros from 5.15
billion euros.  Last year’s cereal-industry exports were worth 2.91 billion
euros, little changed from 2011, Anacer said. Pasta shipments
rose to 1.63 billion euros from 1.51 billion euros. Italy is the
world’s biggest maker of the foodstuff, according to the
International Pasta Organisation.  Italy’s grain-trade deficit shrank to 1.95 billion euros
from the year-earlier shortfall of 2.24 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
