Puerto Rico’s general-obligation
credit grade was lowered by  Fitch Ratings  to one level above
junk as the commonwealth’s budget gap has increased.  Fitch downgraded Puerto Rico, a self-governing U.S.
commonwealth, to BBB- from BBB+, the ratings company said today.
The outlook is negative.  Economic and revenue underperformance “has significantly
increased the size of the operating imbalance for the current
fiscal year and the gap presented to the commonwealth as it
develops a budget for 2014,” Karen Krop, a Fitch analyst, wrote
in a report.  “The current-year deficit is now projected to be well
above the $1.1 billion originally forecast,” the report said.
Moody’s Investors Service estimates the gap may be almost $2.2
billion.  Puerto Rico has $10.6 billion of general-obligation debt,
according to Fitch. Puerto Rico bonds are tax-exempt in all U.S.
states.  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s also grade the commonwealth’s
general-obligation bonds one step above junk with a negative
outlook.  -- Editors: Mark Tannenbaum, Stephen Merelman  To contact the reporter on this story:
