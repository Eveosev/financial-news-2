Barclays Plc (BARC) , the U.K.’s second-
largest bank by assets, paid nine senior executives 40.3 million
pounds ($61 million) in bonuses, less than a year after the bank
was fined for manipulating benchmark  interest rates .  Rich Ricci , head of its investment bank and one of the last
members of former Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond ’s
management team, was awarded 5.7 million shares valued at 17.6
million pounds, London-based Barclays said today in a statement.
CEO Antony Jenkins was given 1.8 million shares valued at 5.59
million pounds.  Barclays, which was fined 290 million pounds in June for
rigging the London interbank offered rate, is cutting 3,700 jobs
to reduce annual costs by 1.7 billion pounds this year. The
lender in February posted a net loss of 1.04 billion pounds for
2012, its first in two decades, as it set aside an additional 1
billion pounds in the fourth quarter to compensate clients
wrongly sold  interest-rate swaps  and loan insurance.  “The share releases detailed in this announcement include
deferred shares awarded from previous years’ annual performance
bonuses and, in some cases, vesting of historical long-term
incentive plans,” the bank said in the statement. “Barclays
has revised its remuneration policy and all future incentive
awards short and long-term, will be based on the new
principles.”  The shares fell 0.8 percent to 295.2 pence in London
trading today.  Wealth Unit  The awards compare with 28.5 million pounds shared among
eight executives last year.  The head of the wealth unit, Thomas Kalaris, was given 5.5
million pounds of stock. Finance Director Chris Lucas, who said
last month he would retire as soon as a successor is found, was
awarded 1.23 million pounds.  The shares were valued at 308.1 pence apiece when the award
was made, Barclays said.  Ashok Vaswani, head of Barclays’s U.K. retail unit; Valerie Soranno Keating, head of Barclaycard; General Counsel Mark Harding; Chief Risk Officer Robert Le Blanc and Shaygan Kheradpir, its chief operations and technology officer also
received awards.  Fewer Barclays employees were paid 1 million pounds last
year than in 2011, according to its annual report published
March 8. The lender awarded 428 workers more than 1 million
pounds in 2012, compared with 473 in 2011.  The average bonus given to employees fell 13 percent to
13,300 pounds, while awards at the investment bank declined 17
percent from the previous year to 54,100 pounds, Barclays said
in February. Some 45 percent of all investment-bank employees
got no bonus for 2012.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Edward Evans  To contact the reporter on this story:
