South African corn futures declined
for the first time in four days as the rand strengthened against
the dollar, making the price of locally produced grain more
attractive.  White corn for delivery in July, the most active contract,
fell 0.5 percent to 2,359.80 rand ($254) a metric ton, the most
since March 14, on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in the same month,
dropped 0.4 percent to 2,301 rand a ton.  The rand was trading at 9.2509 per dollar at 9:20 a.m. and
it strengthened 0.4 percent to 9.2159 at the close of the
futures exchange, shortly before the central bank left its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged.  “The rand was weaker during trade, but it strengthened
again after the market closed, causing a slight drop in
prices,” Thys Grobbelaar, an analyst at Klerksdorp, South
Africa-based Senwes Ltd., said by phone.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
White corn is a staple food, while the yellow variety is mainly
used as  animal feed .  Wheat for May delivery gained 1.2 percent to 3,468 rand a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
