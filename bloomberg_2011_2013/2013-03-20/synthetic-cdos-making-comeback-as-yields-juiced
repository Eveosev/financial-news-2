Derivatives that pool credit-
default swaps to make magnified bets on corporate debt,
popularized in the last credit bubble, are making a comeback as
investors search farther afield for alternatives to bonds at
record-low yields.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  is among banks that have sold as much as $1
billion of synthetic collateralized debt obligations this year,
following $2 billion in all of 2012, according to estimates from
the New York-based lender. Trading in so-called tranches of
indexes that use a similar strategy to juice yields rose 61
percent in the past month.  Synthetic credit, which amplified the financial crisis five
years ago, is enticing investors after corporate-bond yields
dropped to less than half the 20-year average. By betting on the
degree to which a group of companies will default, a CDO may pay
relative yields of more than 5 percentage points, four times
that of a typical credit-swaps transaction on similar debt.  “That’s a valid strategy for this part of the credit
cycle: Don’t stretch on  credit quality , but rather leverage your
exposure to better-quality credit,”  Ashish Shah , the head of
global credit investment at New York-based AllianceBernstein LP,
which oversees $256 billion in fixed-income assets, said in a
telephone interview.  Pooling Swaps  New York-based Citigroup offered one synthetic CDO trade to
hedge funds this year that pooled credit swaps insuring against
defaults of 125 corporate borrowers, according to a person
familiar with the pitch and a copy of a proposed portfolio
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The investor would start bearing losses in the pool when
they reached 5 percent and would be wiped out if losses exceeded
7 percent, getting paid at least 500 basis points annually for
three years. A simple credit-swaps trade on the same companies
would have paid at least 130 basis points, according to the
marketing document.  Unlike many of the synthetic deals created during the
market’s peak before 2008, the transaction pitched by Citigroup
wasn’t to be sold to investors in the form of securities and
wasn’t graded by ratings companies.  About $2 billion notional of similar trades were created
last year and between $500 million and $1 billion in 2013,
Mickey Bhatia, the head of structured credit at Citigroup, said
in an interview. The trades average between $10 million and $30
million, he said, declining to comment on any specific
transactions.  ‘Desperate Search’  “Investors are in a desperate search for yield,” said
David Knutson, a credit analyst at Legal & General Investment
Management America. “CDO products offer incremental yield to
plain-vanilla transactions.”  Elsewhere in credit markets, a benchmark gauge of corporate
credit risk in the U.S. increased as banks,  hedge funds  and
other money managers moved trades into a new version of the
credit-default swaps index.  Series 20 of the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index, used to hedge against losses on company debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, traded at 89 basis points, or 9.2
basis points higher than Series 19 as of 11:24 a.m. in  New York ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The new series should
trade 9 basis points wider than the old benchmark, based on the
cost of the individual credit-default swaps on companies in each
index, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts.  Block, Genworth  New versions of Markit Group Ltd.’s indexes are created
every six months. Companies are replaced if they no longer have
appropriate credit grades, aren’t among the most actively traded
borrowers or fail to meet other criteria. Block Financial LLC
and  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  were added to the new version while
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and CenturyLink Inc. were
removed.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  The U.S. two-year interest-rate swap spread, a measure of
debt-market stress, decreased 1.7 basis points to 16.56 basis
points as of 11:25 a.m. in New York. The measure narrows when
investors favor assets such as corporate debt and widens when
they seek the perceived safety of  government securities .  Index Tranches  Bonds of  Charlotte , North Carolina-based  Bank of America
Corp.  are the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate
securities by dealers, accounting for 6.3 percent of the volume
of dealer trades of $1 million or more as of 11:19 a.m. in New
York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Index tranches are sliced up according to risk, with some
investors agreeing to insure against the first few defaults
among the pool of companies. Most trades have been in the lower-
ranked tranches, with maturities of one to three years and
predominantly in the U.S. and  Europe , Bhatia said.  “It’s to do with the macroeconomic view,” with more
certainty in the near-term than out 10 years, as well as
liquidity concerns about the ability to sell in the secondary
market, he said.  Synthetic CDOs  Sales of bespoke synthetic CDOs are climbing after the
market all but shut down during the financial crisis in 2008.
After the amount of credit protection sold through CDOs in that
period climbed to about $1 trillion, investors took losses of up
to 90 percent on deals that bet heavily on financial firms that
failed during the crisis, including  Lehman Brothers  Holdings
Inc. and Icelandic banks.  In the mortgage market, CDOs that packaged home-loan
securities and were given top AAA ratings by S&P wiped out
investors in a matter of months, according to a lawsuit by the
 Justice Department  filed Feb. 4 in  Los Angeles .  Synthetic CDOs “enabled securitization to continue and
expand even as the mortgage market dried up and provided
speculators with a means of betting on the housing market,” the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Committee wrote in a 2012  report . “By
layering on correlated risk, they spread and amplified exposure
to losses when the housing market collapsed.”  As the  Federal Reserve  holds its benchmark  interest rate 
near zero for a fifth year, investors including pension funds
and hedge funds are again seeking out more structured debt or
derivatives that offer greater yields than the bonds or loans
underlying them.  Yield Alternatives  Average yields on investment-grade corporate bonds dropped
to 2.82 percent on March 18, 3.16 percentage points below the
average since 1993, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch U.S. Corporate Index. Yields have fallen from a record 9.3
percent in October 2008, the month after Lehman Brothers filed
for bankruptcy.  Sales of collateralized loan obligations, which pool
together the senior secured debt of speculative-grade companies,
surged more than fourfold last year to $55 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America expects $75 billion
to be created this year.  In the index tranche market, the simplest form of a
synthetic CDO where investors bet on the degree to which
companies in credit-swaps benchmarks will default, trading also
is increasing.  MBIA, Radian  Net outstanding contracts on tranches of the current
version of the Markit CDX investment-grade index climbed to
$1.48 billion in the week ended March 15, from $919 million a
month earlier, according to the  Depository Trust & Clearing
Corp. , which runs a central repository for the market. The
market has expanded 71 percent in the past year.  By comparison, tranche trades on Series 9 of the index,
created in September 2007 when the synthetic CDO market was near
its peak, have dropped 42 percent to $37.2 billion. Series 9 of
the index is tied to  121 companies , all of which were investment
grade at the time, including Armonk, New York-based MBIA Inc.’s
now junk-rated MBIA Insurance Corp. unit and Philadelphia-based
Radian Group Inc.  Trading in synthetic CDOs will continue to rebound even
after global bank capital rules and the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act make
derivatives more expensive to trade and hold, Peter Tchir,
founder of New York-based TF Market Advisors, said in a March 15
e-mail to clients.  “There’s going to be this bigger search for yield and
spread, and tranches are a natural way to do it,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
