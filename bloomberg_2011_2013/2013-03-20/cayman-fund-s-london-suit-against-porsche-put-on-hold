Porsche Automobil Holding SE (PAH3) ’s U.K.
dispute with a Cayman Islands-based investment fund was put on
hold while a court in Stuttgart,  Germany , decides where the case
should be heard.  The U.K. case must be stayed until the Stuttgart Regional
Court decides “whether the courts in Germany or England” take
precedence in the proceedings, according to a court order dated
March 6 and made public today.  Pendragon (Master) Fund Ltd. is seeking $195 million from
the German carmaker stemming from its failed takeover bid for
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  more than four years ago amid accusations of
market manipulation. Elliott International LP and 11 other hedge
funds agreed to drop their suit against Porsche on March 7.  Calls to Porsche’s press office and lawyers acting for
Pendragon weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
