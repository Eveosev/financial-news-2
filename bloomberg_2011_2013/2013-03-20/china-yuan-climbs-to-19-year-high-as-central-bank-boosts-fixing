The  yuan  rose to a 19-year high
after the People’s Bank of  China  set the currency’s reference
rate at the strongest level since Jan. 15 amid U.S. Treasury
Secretary Jacob L. Lew’s visit to Beijing for talks.  The central bank boosted the yuan’s  fixing  by 0.07 percent
to 6.2716 per dollar today. Lew, who has pledged to press China
to adopt a market-determined exchange rate, will have separate
meetings with Premier Li Keqiang and PBOC Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan . The greenback rose against the euro today as
investors sought havens after the Cypriot parliament voted down
a bank-deposit levy needed to secure a bailout.  “It may be because the U.S. Treasury Secretary is in
Beijing,” said Andy Ji, a foreign-exchange strategist in
 Singapore  at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia. (CBA)  “If you look at
the U.S. dollar move, naturally the fixing should be for a
stronger dollar.”  The yuan gained 0.05 percent to 6.2127 as of 10:53 a.m. in
Shanghai, prices from China Foreign Exchange Trade System show.
It touched 6.2120 today, the strongest level since the
government unified the official and market rates at the end of
1993. China limits the currency’s movement to 1 percent on
either side of the daily fixing.  Xi Jinping  Lew, who succeeded Timothy F. Geithner, last month cited
“progress” by China on the currency and said more needs to be
done. He met Chinese President Xi Jinping yesterday and
discussed the exchange rate, the global economy and the
situation in Cyprus among various issues during the 45-minute
meeting, according to a U.S. official who asked not to be
identified.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, China’s currency was little
changed at 6.2097 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.05 percent to
6.3138 in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The contracts traded at a 1.6 percent discount to the spot rate
in  Shanghai .  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.25 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
