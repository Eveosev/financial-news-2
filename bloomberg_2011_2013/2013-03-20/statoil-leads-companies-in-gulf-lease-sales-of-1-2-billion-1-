A federal sale of oil-drilling
rights in the  Gulf of Mexico  drew more than $1.2 billion in high
bids today, making it one of the top 10 sales of its kind in the
past four decades.  A venture of  Statoil ASA (STL) , the biggest Norwegian energy
company, and a Samson Offshore LLC held the top bid among 407
submitted on 320 separate tracts, according to the U.S.
Department of Interior’s offshore leasing bureau. The venture
bid $81.8 million for a single lease.  “This sale serves as a reminder that the Gulf of Mexico
will continue to play a key role” in U.S. oil production, Tommy Beaudreau, the head of the  Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ,
said on a conference call with reporters.  BOEM estimated that the 39 million acres available for sale
could result in the production of as many as 890 million
barrels of oil and 3.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest U.S. oil company, had high
bids valued at $220.3 million, the most of any company,
according to the agency. Exxon made offers on eight blocks.
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , submitted the 38 high bids, valued at
$139.8 million, the agency said.  The agency must now review the bids before declaring the
final winner for each block. A total of 52 offshore energy
companies submitted bids, Interior said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
