West Texas Intermediate oil rose
the most in almost two weeks after the  Federal Reserve  said it
will keep up its pace of bond buying to spur economic growth and
U.S. inventories unexpectedly dropped.  Prices advanced 0.9 percent as the Fed pledged to keep up
$85 billion in monthly purchases until “the outlook for the
labor market has improved substantially,” according to a
statement released at the end of a two-day gathering of policy
makers. Most economists in a Bloomberg survey before the meeting
forecast the central bank will halt the stimulus in the first
half of 2014. Supplies fell for the first time since January.  “Stimulus is not going away anytime soon,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge
fund that focuses on energy. “There is going to be plenty of
money coming into the system and it should help engender further
gains for crude.”  WTI futures for April delivery, which expired today, rose
80 cents, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $92.96 on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the biggest gain since March 7. The more
actively traded May contract was up 98 cents, or 1.1 percent, at
$93.50. The volume of all futures was 15 percent below the 100-
day average for the time of day at 3:46 p.m., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for May settlement increased $1.27, or 1.2 percent,
to end the session at $108.72 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. It closed at $107.45 yesterday, the
lowest level since Dec. 10. The volume of all futures was 20
percent below the 100-day average. Brent’s premium over the
same-month WTI contract was $15.22, up from yesterday’s $14.93.  Asset Purchases  The Fed’s asset purchases will remain divided between $40
billion a month of mortgage-backed securities and $45 billion a
month of  Treasury securities , the central bank said. It began
the third round of large-scale asset purchases in September.  The central bank also left unchanged a statement that it
plans to hold the target interest rate near zero as long as
unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and inflation is
projected to be no more than 2.5 percent.  Prices also rose as U.S.  inventories  fell 1.31 million
barrels in the seven days ended March 15 to 382.7 million, the
first decline since Jan. 11, according to the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a gain of 2 million.  West Coast  The biggest supply drop was on the West Coast, where
stockpiles decreased 2.75 million barrels. A change in oil
supplies in the area, classified by the department as PADD 5, is
sometimes disregarded by traders because the region’s
distribution system is isolated from the rest of the U.S. said
Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche
Capital Advisors.  Excluding the West Coast, supply rose 1.44 million barrels.  “If you take out West Coast, inventories actually had a
build,” Zahir said. “Overall, it’s a mixed report. Demand is
still pretty weak.”  Total petroleum  consumption  dropped 4.5 percent to 17.8
million barrels a day in the week ended March 15, the weakest
level since Jan. 4.  U.S. crude  production  slipped 9,000 barrels a day from the
highest level since 1992 to 7.15 million. Stockpiles at Cushing,
 Oklahoma , the largest U.S. oil-storage hub and the delivery
point for New York-traded futures, shrank by 286,000 barrels to
49 million, the EIA reported.  Cyprus Tax  Oil also gained as the  European Central Bank  is likely to
delay a vote on emergency support for Cyprus, two people
familiar with the deliberations said, giving the government and
euro-area officials more days to forge a deal after a banking-
tax measure was defeated yesterday.  While the island country accounts for less than half a
percent of the euro-region economy, the fight over the bank tax
risks triggering new turmoil in the financial crisis that began
in 2009 in  Greece . The European Union accounted for 16 percent
of the world’s oil demand in 2011, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  “Oil is going back and forth on the Cyprus situation,”
said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the Price Futures
Group in  Chicago .  The euro gained as much as 0.8 percent to $1.2979. A
stronger euro and weaker dollar increase dollar-denominated
oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI crude options
expiring in May was at 18 percent at 3:45 p.m. in New York, down
from 19.2 percent yesterday. The figures are down from 24.7
percent on Feb. 21.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 404,454
contracts as of 3:47 p.m. It totaled 680,198 contracts
yesterday, 25 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.65 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
