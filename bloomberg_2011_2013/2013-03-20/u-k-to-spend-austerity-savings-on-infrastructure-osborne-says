The U.K. government will increase
spending on infrastructure projects by an annual 3 billion
pounds ($4.6 billion) from 2015 as Chancellor George Osborne
seeks to boost economic growth.  The measure will raise funding for projects such as  road
construction , railway extensions and renewable energy by 15
billion pounds over a 10-year period, Osborne said in his budget
statement to parliament in  London  today.  Capital spending  had
previously been set to fall from about 2015, he said.  “By investing in the economic arteries of this country, we
will get growth flowing to every part of it,” Osborne said.
Cutting infrastructure spending at a time of low growth is not
“sensible,” he added.  Osborne, 41, is under pressure to boost growth, which has
been hurt by budget cuts and the euro region’s fiscal crisis,
after the country lost its AAA credit rating last month. The
government today cut its economic growth forecasts for this year
and next to 0.6 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.  Paul Deighton, the former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
executive who helped build London’s 2012 Olympic venues, will
lead the government’s renewed drive to expand infrastructure
projects across the country, Osborne said.  ‘Good Move’  “Reassigning 3 billion pounds annually from current to
capital expenditure is a good move for infrastructure,” Nigel Wilson, Chief Executive Officer of  Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN) ,
the U.K.’s biggest manager of U.K. pension assets, said in e-
mailed remarks following the budget. Deighton’s “challenge is
not just about finance: it is about speeding the process to
deliver more projects, faster,” he added.  Public sector gross investment will remain at 50.4 billion
pounds in the 2015 to 2016 period compared with 2014 to 2015,
before increasing to 51.3 billion pounds in 2016 to 2017 and to
52.1 billion pounds the following year, the government said in
the  budget . That’s down from 69 billion pounds in 2009 to 2010,
the last year of  Gordon Brown ’s government.  The failure to build new infrastructure is weighing on
growth in an economy that is still 3.2 percent below its peak at
the start of 2009, according to gross domestic product data
published by the  Office for National Statistics  in January.  Only 1.2 percent of the 576 projects highlighted in the
government’s National Infrastructure Plan have been completed or
are operational, the  Labour Party  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
