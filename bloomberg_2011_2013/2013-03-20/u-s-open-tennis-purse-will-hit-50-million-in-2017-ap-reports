The U.S. Open tennis Grand Slam
will almost double its player prize money to $50 million by
2017, the Associated Press reported.  The  New York  tournament, one of tennis’ four annual majors,
also plans to switch back to a Sunday men’s final in 2015 after
having it on Monday in 2013 and 2014, the AP said, citing United
States Tennis Association officials it didn’t identify.  The tournament, which runs for two weeks in August and
September at the National Tennis Center, offered prize money of
$25.5 million last year, the AP said, and will pay out $33.6
million this year.  The USTA plans to announce the changes today, the AP
reported. USTA spokesman Chris Widmaier didn’t respond to an e-
mail sent late last night seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
