Gold is poised to retreat 1.8
percent this year as demand may decline if instability in global
financial markets eases and consumption drops,  Australia ’s
Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics said.  Prices may average $1,638 an ounce in 2013 from $1,668 a
year earlier, the Canberra-based bureau said in a  report  today.
That compares with a December forecast of $1,738 for 2013.  Global mine production may increase to 2,956 tons in 2013
from 2,836 tons last year, the report said. World fabrication
consumption, which includes jewelry, electronics and coins, may
decline 1.3 percent to 2,580 tons in 2013, it said. Central
banks may purchase 550 tons in 2013, compared with 536 tons last
year, the bureau said.  Gold production in Australia may increase 5.9 percent to
270 tons in the year starting July 1, today’s report said. The
country may export 347 tons in 2013-2014 from 320 tons a year
earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
