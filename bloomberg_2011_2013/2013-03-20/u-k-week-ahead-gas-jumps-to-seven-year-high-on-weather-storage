U.K. natural gas prices for next-
week delivery rose to the highest in more than seven years as
forecasters predicted temperatures 8 degrees Celsius below
normal and storage inventories approached record-low levels.  Within-day, next-day and month-ahead gas prices also
advanced, according to Marex Spectron Group Ltd. data compiled
by Bloomberg. The average U.K temperature will be 0.2 degrees
Celsius (32 Fahrenheit) next week, compared with a 10-year
average of 8.2 degrees, MetraWeather data using the ECMWF model
show. Inventories at Rough, the U.K.’s largest gas-storage
facility, fell to 3,029 gigawatt-hours yesterday, approaching a
record 2,924 gigawatt-hours reached March 19, 2010,  National
Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  The weather in the U.K. next week will be “breezy and very
cold for the time of year,” the  Met Office  said on its website.
There will be “a lot of dry weather with a mixture of variable
cloud, snow showers in northern parts especially, and sunny
intervals. Temperatures are likely to be well below normal in
all areas.”  Next-week gas jumped as much as 14 percent to 98 pence a
therm at 2:30 p.m. London time. Within-day gas added 11 percent
to 97 pence a therm and the day-ahead contract increased 13
percent to 98 pence a therm.  Gas for April climbed 1.2 percent to 69.65 pence a therm.
That’s equivalent to $10.56 per million British thermal units
and compares with $3.92 per million Btu of front-month U.S. gas.  Inventories Shrink  Rough inventories fell 283 gigawatt-hours (27 million cubic
meters) yesterday, leaving less than 11 days of storage if
withdrawals continue at the same rate, according to National
Grid data. Flows from Rough were at a rate of 11 million cubic
meters a day today.  Imports from  Belgium  were at 72 million cubic meters a day,
approaching a record 78 million, National Grid data show. Flows
from  Norway , the U.K.’s biggest source of imported gas, were at
116 million cubic meters a day, versus a 10-day average of 100
million, Gassco AS data show.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 322
million cubic meters, the most since March 14, and up from a
seasonal norm of 276 million, grid data show.  Norwegian gas production was cut by 12.2 million cubic
meters a day today,  Statoil ASA (STL)  said on its website.  Gas accounted for 33 percent of U.K. power production at
1:40 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 41 percent, nuclear 17
percent and wind 3.1 percent.  Electricity for tomorrow surged 10 percent to 67.20 pounds
a megawatt-hour, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
