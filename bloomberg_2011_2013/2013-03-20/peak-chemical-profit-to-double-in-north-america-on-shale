North American chemical makers will
earn twice what they did in the last cyclical peak as cheap
natural gas combines with an improving global economy to boost
exports, an industry consulting group said.  Petrochemical earnings globally will peak in 2017 as rising
demand outpaces new production capacity, Dave Witte, a senior
vice president at  IHS Inc. (IHS) , said today at the IHS World
Petrochemical Conference in Houston. Pretax profit per ton will
double in North America from the last peak in 2008, while
earnings in Asia and Europe will follow past trends, Witte said.  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  are among producers
planning new U.S. plants that make ethylene, a chemical building
block, from ethane and other natural gas liquids, which have
dropped in price with increased production from shale rock
formations. Much of the new production will be exported to fast-
growing emerging markets, Witte said.  “North America is not a growth market, but we are back in
the game as an exporter to the world,” Stephen Pryor, president
of Exxon’s chemical business, said at the conference.  As production in  North America  rises, the least competitive
European assets that use oil-derived naphtha will be shut, said
Gary Adams, IHS chief advisor. About 2 million tons of annual
ethylene capacity may need to close in Europe as North American
exports increase, Graeme Burnett, a senior vice president at
 Total SA (FP) , said at the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
