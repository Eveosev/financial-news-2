Denmark’s central bank cut its
economic growth forecast for this year as the Nordic nation
struggles to withstand a recession in  Europe  and extricate
itself from a burst property bubble in 2008.  Gross domestic product will grow 0.8 percent in 2013, the
Copenhagen-based bank said today, lowering a 1.3 percent
December forecast. The expansion will be 1.7 percent in 2014,
compared with a 1.8 percent prior estimate, the bank predicted.  The government also yesterday lowered its forecast after
the economy contracted 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter. The
Danish economy shrank 0.6 percent last year for the worst
economic contraction since the peak of the global financial
crisis in 2009. The country is struggling to emerge from a burst
housing bubble in 2008 that’s depressed consumer spending and
caused at least a dozen bank failures.  “Denmark will have higher growth than the  euro zone  and it
appears that will be the case into 2015,” Central bank Governor
Lars Rohde told a press conference in Copenhagen. “Consumption
has been held up and there’s quite a big potential for the
economy to be released when confidence returns. For consumers
that will largely be related to the  property market .”  The $312 billion economy will be helped this year by a 0.7
percent gain in  consumer spending  and 1 percent rise in public
spending, the central bank forecast. Housing investments will
slide 0.6 percent, compared with a December estimate for a 1.7
percent gain.  Five years into the global financial crisis, the Social
Democrat-led government has turned to corporate tax cuts to
support the economy. The move, which was announced last month,
follows income tax breaks and government payouts of more than 27
billion kroner ($4.7 billion) that had failed to spur consumer
demand.  Denmark has a fixed exchange rate policy and pegs its krone
to the euro. The central bank uses policy to target a krone rate
of 7.46038 against the common currency. The bank in January
raised its lending rate to 0.3 percent from 0.2 percent. It also
increased its deposit rate to minus 0.1 percent from minus 0.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
