Nam Long Investment Corp. , a real-
estate company, plans to sell shares on the Ho Chi Minh City
Stock Exchange next month after a rally for the stock market
made it  Asia ’s second-best performer this year.  The Ho Chi Minh City-based company will offer 95.5 million
shares at a price of 27,000 dong on April 8, Chief Operating
Officer Nguyen Vinh Tran said in a phone interview.  The benchmark  VN Index (VNINDEX)  of the Ho Chi Minh City Stock
Exchange has rallied 18 percent this year, the best-performing
measure in Asia after  Japan . The gauge, which jumped 18 percent
last year, rose 1.4 percent today.  The market “is rebounding, so listing at this time would
be good for us,” Tran said. “Even though the property market
is still gloomy, with our right business strategy, we believe
the company will still make a profit and investors can get good
returns.”  Vietnam ’s  property market  is “frozen and faces many
difficulties” with about 112 trillion dong of real-estate
projects unsold, according to a January posting on the website
of the National Assembly’s Economic Committee. Credit growth may
remain slow in the first few months of 2013, Prime Minister
Nguyen Tan Dung said on Jan. 1.  Nam Long focuses mainly on affordable housing, Tran said.
There will be “very high demand” because prices are
“reasonable” for a majority of customers, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
