England  batsman  Kevin Pietersen 
will miss the final cricket Test in the series with New Zealand
because of an injury to his right knee.  The 32-year-old hurt the joint during fielding practice
earlier this month and scans found bone bruising and possible
cartilage damage, the England and Wales Cricket Board said today
in an e-mailed statement.  “The injury is likely to require ongoing assessments and a
likely 6-8 week period of rest and rehabilitation,” the ECB
said in the statement. “Pietersen has therefore been withdrawn
from all cricket including the Indian Premier League.”   The final Test between England and New Zealand starts in
two days in Auckland, with the first two matches ending in
draws.  New Zealand , which has lost eight of its past 13 elite
five-day matches, last won a series against England 14 years
ago.  England is also missing spin bowler Graeme Swann, who
started two months of rehabilitation after an operation to
remove excess bone formation in his right elbow earlier this
month.   The 33-year-old Swann, whose 212 Test wickets are the
second-most by an England spinner, was ruled out of the series
with New Zealand and had surgery in the U.S.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
