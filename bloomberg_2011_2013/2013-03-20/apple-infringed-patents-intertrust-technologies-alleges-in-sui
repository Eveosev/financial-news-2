Intertrust Technologies Corp., a
developer of digital rights management software jointly owned by
 Sony Corp. (6758)  and  Royal Philips (PHIA)  Electronics NV, sued  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  for
allegedly infringing 15 patents related to mobile-device
security.  Apple’s iPhone, the iPod touch, iPad product lines, laptop
computers, Apple TV and App Store are built on secure computing
technologies developed and patented by Intertrust, the company
said in a complaint filed today in Oakland, California, federal
court. Intertrust has previously sued  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  over
patents. The software maker settled and licensed the technology
in 2004 for $440 million, according to the complaint.  “Apple’s decision to free-ride off Intertrust’s
innovations has caused, and continues to cause, substantial harm
to Intertrust,” according to the complaint.  Intertrust is seeking a court order barring further
infringement and sales of products that infringe the patents,
lost profit damages, a reasonable royalty and a finding that the
infringement was willful, which would triple damages.  Amy Bessette, a spokeswoman at Cupertino, California-based
Apple, declined to comment on the patent lawsuit.  The case is Intertrust Technologies Corp. v. Apple Inc.,
13-1235, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
