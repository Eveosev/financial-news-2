Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy  said he expects to cut his forecast for economic growth
this year, bowing to pressure from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund .  Spain’s economy will probably contract by more than the
government’s forecast of 0.5 percent as recession in the euro
region curbs demand for the country’s exports and spending cuts
damp the domestic economy, Rajoy told the parliament in  Madrid 
today. The euro-zone economy will shrink by 0.3 percent in 2013,
the EU said last month.  “All this can force us to modify our forecasts,” the
premier told lawmakers. “I think we will change our
forecasts.”  The Spanish economy is suffering from the sixth year of an
economic slump that has pushed unemployment to a record 26
percent. The pace of contraction in  service industries 
accelerated in February from the previous month, according to a
survey of companies published March 5.  The IMF forecast the Spanish economy will shrink by 1.5
percent this year while the EU expects a 1.4 percent
contraction.  “These forecasts have to be particularly conservative to
make budget deficit-path projections credible,” Economy
Minister Luis de Guindos told reporters outside the chamber.  To contact the reporters on this story:
