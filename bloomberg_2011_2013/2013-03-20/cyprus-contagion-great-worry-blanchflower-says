Former Bank of England policy maker
 David Blanchflower  said the risks of spillover effects from
turmoil in Cyprus are a concern.  “The contagion is a great worry,” he said in an interview
with  Tom Keene  on Bloomberg Television today. “If you can’t
solve a small problem, you’ve made it clear to the markets that
you can’t deal with big ones.”  A rescue package to keep Cyprus in the euro was thrown into
limbo after the nation yesterday rejected an unprecedented levy
on  bank deposits . Germany and its euro-area allies maintained
pressure on the island’s politicians today to raise a planned
5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) by drawing funds from Cyprus
bank accounts in return for 10 billion euros in external aid.  Officials from the so-called troika of the  European Central
Bank , the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Commission are in Cyprus discussing further capital controls and
the possible extension of a bank holiday through the end of the
week, a European official familiar with the talks said on
condition of anonymity because the discussions are confidential.  “The prescription is that we’ve got to go sort this out
because the banks eventually have to open,” said Blanchflower,
who now teaches at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. “My big 
worry is -- exactly what happened in Ireland -- firms who had 
money in those banks started to pull them out.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
