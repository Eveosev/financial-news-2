British Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  was challenged about how London’s Evening
Standard newspaper came to reveal details of his budget before
he announced it.  Around 15 minutes before Osborne began speaking in
Parliament, the Standard’s Twitter feed posted an image of its
 front page , showing details of lower growth figures and higher
borrowing, as well as cuts in duty on alcohol, a freeze in fuel
duty, a rise in the income-tax threshold and a corporation-tax
cut. Labour treasury spokesman  Ed Balls  waved a printout of the
page at Osborne as he began delivering his budget statement.  “The whole budget, including the market sensitive fiscal
forecasts, were in the Standard before he rose to his feet,”
Labour leader  Ed Miliband  said. “I hope he will investigate.”  While elements of U.K. budget statements are often reported
in advance, comprehensive leaks are rare. In 1947, a previous
chancellor, Hugh Dalton, resigned after leaking details of his
budget to a reporter, who got them into print before Dalton
began speaking.  “An investigation is immediately under way into how this
front page was made public and the individual who tweeted the
page has been suspended while this takes place,” the
newspaper’s editor, Sarah Sands, said in an e-mailed statement.
“We have immediately reviewed our procedures. We are devastated
that an embargo was breached and offer our heartfelt
apologies.”  In 1996, Ken Clarke’s entire budget was leaked to the  Daily
Mirror , which returned the documents to the Treasury without
printing the contents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
