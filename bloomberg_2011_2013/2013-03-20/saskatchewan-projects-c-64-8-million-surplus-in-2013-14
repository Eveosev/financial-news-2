Saskatchewan Finance Minister Ken
Krawetz is forecasting a C$64.8 million ($63.2 million) surplus
for the next fiscal year while spending more on public works.  Revenue will rise to C$11.61 billion in the fiscal year
starting April 1 from C$11.40 billion while spending grows to
C$11.54 billion from C$11.39 billion, according to the plan
Krawetz presented today in the provincial capital Regina.
Infrastructure spending will grow 7.6 percent to C$847.5
million.  “One of the biggest challenges of growth is making sure we
have the infrastructure we need for a growing economy,” Krawetz
said in the prepared text of his budget remarks.  The plan is based on a forecast of 2.6 percent economic
expansion this year and 3.1 percent next year, led by
investments to develop potash deposits and growth in employment
and population. The western Canadian province, a major wheat
producer, is home to  Potash Corp. (POT) , the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, and  Cameco Corp. (CCO) , the
largest uranium producer.  The budget assumes potash prices will rise to $413.84 a ton
next year from $388.99 this year, with both figures lower than
last year’s $444.15. Wheat prices will increase to C$286.86 a
metric ton next year from C$274.02 this year.  The province’s surplus for the fiscal year ending March 31
was cut to C$8.8 million from an original C$95 million as
spending exceeded forecasts. The budget also cut property tax
rates while increasing levies on tobacco and alcohol, and
deferred a plan to reduce the corporate  tax rate  to 10 percent
from 12 percent, which was scheduled to happen by 2015.  Savings Fund  Half of the surplus will be transferred into a special
savings fund, raising its total to C$695.1 million next year.
The surplus before such transfers is projected to widen to
C$163.8 million for fiscal 2014-15.  Saskatchewan’s borrowing requirement will rise to C$1.59
billion in 2013-14 from C$1.39 billion this year, most of which
is for government-owned corporations, according to the budget
documents.  The province has about C$8.7 billion in outstanding bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Saskatchewan’s debt is
rated Aa1 by Moody’s Investors Service and AAA by  Standard &
Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
