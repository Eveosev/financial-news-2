A benchmark gauge of corporate
credit risk increased as banks, hedge funds and other money
managers moved trades into a new version of the credit-default
swaps index.  Series 20 of the Markit CDX North America Investment Grade
Index, used to hedge against losses on company debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, traded at 90.7 basis points, 8.8
basis points higher than Series 19 as of 8:02 a.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The new series should
trade 9 basis points wider than the old benchmark, based on the
cost of the individual credit swaps on companies in each index,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts.  New versions of Markit Group Ltd.’s indexes are created
every six months. Companies are replaced if they no longer have
appropriate credit grades, aren’t among the most actively traded
borrowers or fail to meet other criteria. Block Financial LLC
and  Genworth Financial Inc. (GNW)  were added to the new version while
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. and CenturyLink Inc. were
removed.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
