Russian “dirty money” won’t move
from Cyprus to  London , newspaper tycoon Alexander Lebedev said.  “This money may come into Hyde Park One or the pockets of
a few lawyers, but otherwise it will still be kept outside
Britain,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV today. “It
will be sitting outside in offshore jurisdictions” like  Latvia ,
 Lithuania , Belize and the Marshall Islands, Lebedev said.  London welcomes all legitimate investment from overseas,
Mayor Boris Johnson said March 18. “On the red carpet front,
we’re pretty promiscuous,” he said in a Bloomberg TV interview.
Russia’s benchmark stock index sank to a three-month low that
day on concern Cyprus’s planned deposit levy would hurt local
companies and banks. The country’s lawmakers rejected the
proposal yesterday.  Russian lenders and companies had about $31 billion placed
in Cypriot banks or their own units at the end of 2012,
according to a report from Moody’s Investors Service March 13.
At least $30 billion in further exposure comes from bank loans
to Cypriot companies of Russian origin, the ratings company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
