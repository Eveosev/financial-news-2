Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S.
drugstore chain, had its biggest two-day rally in eight months
after  AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC)  yesterday agreed to handle its
pharmaceutical distribution.  Walgreen  rose  2.9 percent to $46.02 at the close in  New
York  and has increased 8.5 percent in the past two days, the
biggest increase since July. The Deerfield, Illinois-based chain
has gained 24 percent this year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index has advanced 9.3 percent.  The pact that allows  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania-based
AmerisourceBergen to distribute branded and generic drugs will
reduce costs and boost sales of cancer and other specialty
medicines for Walgreen. The accord will start in September and
last 10 years, the companies said in a statement yesterday.  As a part of the agreement, Walgreen and Alliance Boots
GmbH also gained the option to acquire as much as 7 percent of
AmerisourceBergen’s  equity  in the open market, plus warrants for
16 percent of the shares. Walgreen bought a 45 percent stake
last year in Alliance Boots GmbH for $6.7 billion to create a
global chain of pharmacies.  Walgreen has more than 8,000 U.S. locations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
