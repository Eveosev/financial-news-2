Thousands of Muslims protested in a
southern Egyptian town after the family of a young woman said
she may have run off with a Christian, rekindling religious
tensions in an already polarized nation.  The demonstration, involving about 2,000 people in the town
of al-Wasta in the province of Bani Sweif, erupted amid reports
the young woman had converted to Christianity and fled to  Turkey 
with a young man, the state-run Ahram Gate reported. The college
student’s family accused the church of facilitating her
disappearance, the news website said.  The incident late yesterday threatened to reignite tensions
in  Egypt  as Islamist President Mohamed Mursi struggles to
restore order and revive the economy. Muslims-Christian tensions
have been rife, particularly in the southern part of the country
which has traditionally been an Islamist stronghold.  Security forces cordoned off the area around the local
church and police station, while shop owners shuttered their
stores fearing clashes.  The protest comes at a time when some Islamists have begun
setting up community groups to undertake policing
responsibilities in the south, to compensate for what they say
is the lack of police presence. Police disappeared from the
streets in the initial days of the 2011 uprising against  Hosni Mubarak  and have yet to fully resume their duties.  To contact the reporter on this story:
