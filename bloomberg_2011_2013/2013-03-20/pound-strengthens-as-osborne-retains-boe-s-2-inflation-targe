The pound advanced as Chancellor of
the Exchequer  George Osborne  said the government will keep the
Bank of England’s 2 percent target inflation target and allow
room for “tradeoffs” in the decision-making process.  Sterling pared a drop versus the euro. The government is
reviewing the central bank’s remit, including the potential
provision of forward guidance on interest rates, Osborne said
today in parliament.  Government bonds  pared a decline.  The pound strengthened 0.3 percent to $1.5138 at 1:05 p.m.
London time. It was 0.2 percent weaker at 85.48 pence per euro
after earlier sliding 0.8 percent.  Sterling has weakened 4.7 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. It fell amid speculation the Bank
of England would boost its asset-purchase program to revive the
economy and counter the impact of Osborne’s austerity program.
The central bank last increased the target for bond purchases in
July, increasing it by 50 billion pounds to 375 billion pounds.  Inflation has stayed above the Bank of England’s 2 percent
target for each of the past 39 months. The next central bank
policy decision is scheduled for April 4 and Governor  Mervyn
King  is due to be replaced in July by  Mark Carney , who currently
heads Canada’s central bank.  U.K. government bonds returned 1.2 percent this month
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
