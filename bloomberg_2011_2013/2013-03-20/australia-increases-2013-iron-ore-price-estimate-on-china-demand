Australia, the world’s biggest
iron-ore exporter, raised its price estimate for this year on
expectations that increased steel consumption will boost imports
into leading buyer China.  Prices will average $119 a metric ton in 2013, compared
with a December estimate of $106, the Bureau of Resources and
Energy Economics said in a  report  today, referring to rates at
Australian ports. The country may ship 554 million tons of the
steelmaking raw material in 2013, against 543 million tons
estimated in December and 488 million tons in 2012, it said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its estimate to $139 yesterday
for ore delivered in China, while Morgan Stanley said March 7
the raw material had peaked and would decline over the rest of
the year. Prices surged 55 percent from a three-year low in
September as economic growth in China accelerated and port
inventories in the country slumped.  “The announced approval of infrastructure investment
packages in late 2012, particularly expansions to rail networks,
as well as continued growth in commercial and residential
construction are expected to support higher steel consumption,”
the bureau said. China’s steel production may increase to 737
million tons in 2013 from 709 million tons last year, it said.  Growth Estimate  China will expand 8.1 percent this year after the weakest
annual growth in 13 years in 2012, the median estimate of
analysts compiled by Bloomberg shows. The country will spend 650
billion  yuan  ($105 billion) on rail-related fixed-asset
investment in 2013, Rail Minister Sheng Guangzu said in January.  So-called apparent consumption of steel in China, which
includes production and net imports, may rise 4.6 percent to
708.8 million tons in 2013, according to the mean estimate of
six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The country’s iron-ore
 imports  will climb to 773 million tons this year from 745
million tons in 2012, according to today’s report.  Inventories at Chinese ports fell to 66.3 million tons in
the week ended March 8, the lowest since March 2009, according
to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. Stockpiles were
67.2 million tons in the week to March 15, its data show.  New iron-ore supplies and slower growth in steel demand
will weigh on prices in the year’s second half, Greg Lilleyman,
 Rio Tinto Group’s (RIO)  president of Pilbara operations, said
yesterday. Steel demand growth in China slowed from 20 percent
in 2010 to 2.1 percent last year, according to Citigroup Inc.  Rio, Vale  Goldman Sachs also cut its ratings and price targets for
some miners of the ore yesterday, weighing on shares of  Vale SA (VALE5) ,
the world’s biggest producer,  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the biggest
mining company, and Rio, the second-largest exporter.  China on March 1 imposed its toughest real-estate curbs in
a year, ordering the central bank to raise down-payment
requirements and interest rates for some second mortgages, as
well as enforcing a property sales tax.  The bureau’s price forecast referred to iron ore with 62
percent content free-on-board Australia. The same  grade  of ore
delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin fell 0.2 percent to
$134.10 a dry ton today, according to The Steel Index Ltd.
Goldman said yesterday iron ore free-on-board Australia may
average $131 a ton in 2013.  Swaps traded today at $131.50 a ton for April and $118.50
for October, according to GFI Group Inc. data. Iron ore is
measured in dry tons, or metric tons less moisture. At Tianjin
port moisture can account for 8 percent to 10 percent of weight.  To contact the reporter for this story:
