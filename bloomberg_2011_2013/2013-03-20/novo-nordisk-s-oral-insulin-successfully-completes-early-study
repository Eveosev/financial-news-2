Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOB) ’s oral insulin
successfully completed an early-stage study, according to the
Danish drugmaker’s partner,  Merrion Pharmaceuticals Plc (MERR) ,
bringing what would be the first product of its kind a step
closer to market.  The goals of the clinical trial, the first of three phases
of human testing usually required by regulators for marketing
approval, were to test the insulin tablet’s safety,
tolerability, exposure and effect on blood-sugar levels, Dublin-
based Merrion said today in a statement.  Insulin, a hormone used by the body to convert blood sugar
into energy, is currently only available as an injection for
diabetics whose bodies either don’t produce enough insulin or
have become resistant to it. Merrion’s Gipet technology was used
in the formulation of Novo’s oral insulin, known as NN1954.
Merrion will receive payments when the product meets certain
goals during development under a 2008 agreement between the
companies.  Eighty-three people were enrolled in the trial, which began
in May and ended in October, according to an entry on the U.S.
government website  clinicaltrials.gov .  To contact the reporter on this story:
