The  San Francisco 49ers  signed
kicker Phil Dawson and wide receiver Marlon Moore to one-year
contracts, the National Football League team said.  Dawson, 38, was selected for his first Pro Bowl last season
after making 29 of 31 field-goal attempts, including all seven
from more than 50 yards. He’s 29th in NFL history, and seventh
among active players, with 1,271 points scored.  “Phil has performed at a high level throughout his career
and has a lot of experience managing the elements, which is a
valuable asset,” 49ers General Manager Trent Baalke said in a
statement.  The 49ers released  David Akers  on March 6, a month after he
kicked three field goals in the 34-31 Super Bowl loss to
the Baltimore Ravens.  Moore, 25, signed with the  Miami Dolphins  as an undrafted
free agent on April 30, 2010. In three seasons in Miami, he
played in 29 games, recording 12 receptions for 244 yards and
two touchdowns.  The  New York Giants  signed wide receiver Louis Murphy, who
played with Carolina last season. Murphy, 25, has 115 receptions
for 1,707 yards and seven touchdowns in four seasons, including
25 catches with the Panthers in 2012.  The Giants also agreed on a contract with quarterback  David Carr , who will be the backup to starter Eli Manning for the
third straight season, ESPN reported, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the situation.  Carr, 33, attempted only three passes over the past two NFL
seasons behind Manning, who has started 135 straight regular-
season games for the Giants dating to 2004.  First Pick  Carr was the first pick in the 2002 NFL draft and spent his
first five seasons with the Houston Texans, where he completed
60 percent of his passes for 59 touchdowns and 65 interceptions.
He was a backup to Manning in 2008 and 2009, then spent one
season with the 49ers before returning to New York.  The Ravens signed defensive end Marcus Spears to a two-year
contract. The 30-year-old was released last week by the  Dallas
Cowboys  after eight years.  Quarterback  Matt Hasselbeck , released by the Tennessee
Titans, signed with the  Indianapolis Colts . The 37-year-old will
be the backup to Andrew Luck.  Center Brad Meester, 35, rejoined the Jaguars, signing a
one-year deal to play a 14th season. Meester, a second-round
draft pick in 2000, has spent his entire career in Jacksonville.  To contact the reporter on this story:
