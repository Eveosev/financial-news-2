Zijin Mining Group Co.,  Sprott
Inc. (SII) , and Americas Now Resources Investment Management Corp.
will establish a $500 million metals and minerals fund,
according to a statement filed with the Hong Kong Exchange
today.  Zijin, Chinaâ€™s biggest gold miner by market value, will
contribute $100 million to the fund that will invest primarily
in equities and debt instruments related to gold, precious
metals, copper and minerals. Sprott, a Toronto-based  fund
manager , will provide $10 million and at least five percent of
aggregate capital contributions, the company said in the
statement.  Zijin reported Feb. 18  that its unaudited full-year net
income fell to 5.2 billion yuan ($833 million) or 0.238 yuan a
share, from 5.7 billion yuan, or 0.262 yuan a share, a year
earlier as selling prices for some metals dropped and production
costs increased. The decline in profit is its first for a full
year, according a statement filed on the exchange that day.  Americas Now will provide technical and marketing services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
