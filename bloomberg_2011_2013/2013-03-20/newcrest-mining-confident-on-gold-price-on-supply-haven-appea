Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s
largest gold producer, expects prices for bullion will “stay
strong” in the medium term supported by supply constraints and
the metal’s appeal as a haven.  Gold may trade between $1,500 to $2,000 per ounce this
year,  Greg Robinson , chief executive officer of the Melbourne-
based company, told reporters today at conference in Hong Kong.
Bullion for immediate delivery last traded at $1,612.70 an
ounce.  “If I look at the preconditions for the gold price in the
medium term, I think about monetary supply,  currency
devaluation , interest rate, inflation, political economic
drivers,” he told the conference. “I’m confident about the
gold price. I expect them to stay strong for the medium term.”  Bullion has rallied for the past 12 years as nations
pledged more stimulus to support economic growth and as central
banks boosted purchases. Spot gold rose above $1,600 an ounce on
March 18 for the first time this month after an unprecedented
levy on bank deposits in Cyprus increased investors’ demand for
protection of wealth.  “There’s more reasons to own gold today than there have
ever been reasons to own gold,”  Eric Sprott , the founder and
chairman of Canadian fund manager  Sprott Inc. (SII) , said today at the
conference. “I hardly think the crisis is over. The crisis is
in full bloom.”  Newcrest shares closed unchanged in Sydney at A$22.50. The
stock has gained 1.4 percent this year, compared with the 3.9
percent decline in spot gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
