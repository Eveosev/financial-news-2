The ruble climbed the most in more
than two months against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket as oil rose and companies bought the local currency to
make tax payments.  The ruble strengthened 0.3 percent against Bank Rossii’s
basket to 34.9178 as of 12:16 p.m. in Moscow, the strongest
advance on a closing basis since Jan. 8. The currency gained 0.3
percent versus the dollar to 30.88 and added 0.2 percent to
39.8750 versus the euro. Government ruble bonds due Feb. 2027
climbed, cutting the yield three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.47 percent, the lowest this week.  Crude oil,  Russia ’s main export earner, climbed as much as
0.7 percent to $108.24 a barrel in  London . Russian companies

Finance Minister is meeting his Cypriot counterpart for loan

loans to Cypriot companies of Russian origin, the ratings
