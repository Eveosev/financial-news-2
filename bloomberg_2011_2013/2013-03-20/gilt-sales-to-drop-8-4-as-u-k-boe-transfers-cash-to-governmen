U.K. gilt sales will decline 8.4
percent in the next financial year as a cash transfer from the
 Bank of England ’s bond holdings reduces the Treasury’s borrowing
needs.  Britain will issue 151 billion pounds ($228.8 billion) of
gilts in the period beginning next month, the London-based Debt
Management Office said today. That compares with 164.8 billion
pounds planned for the current fiscal year and a median forecast
of 161 billion pounds in a Bloomberg survey of 19 of 21 primary
dealers that trade directly with the debt agency. The sale plans
were released after Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
delivered the budget report to parliament.  The back-to-back decline in bond sales is the first since
the DMO took over gilt management from the Bank of England in
1998. Gilt issuance reached a record high of 227.59 billion
pounds in the fiscal year ended March 2010.  The DMO said it will raise 42.6 billion pounds from short-
maturity gilts, or securities due within 7 years, 30 billion
pounds from medium-term debt and 32.6 billion pounds from bonds
with maturities longer than 15 years. It will sell 35.8 billion
pounds of inflation-protected bonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
