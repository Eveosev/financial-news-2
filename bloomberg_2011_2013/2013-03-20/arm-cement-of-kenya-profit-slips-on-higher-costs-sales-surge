ARM Cement Ltd. (ARML) ,  Kenya ’s second-
biggest producer of the building material, said full-year profit
advanced 8 percent, missing estimates, as sales surged.  Net income advanced to 1.25 billion shillings in the 12
months through December, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement e-mailed by the city’s stock exchange today. Revenue
surged 39 percent to 11.4 billion shillings, it said.  Profit missed the median estimate of 1.32 billion shillings
forecast by three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company has had higher sales in the first two months of
the year versus in 2012 and “expects to register another year
of strong growth, and improved profitability on the back of new
capacity in  Tanzania ,” according to the statement.  Last year, the company commissioned a grinding plant in Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, boosting capacity to 1.85 million metric
tons from 1.1 million tons, according to its  website .  ARM, formerly known as Athi River Mining Ltd., proposed a
five-for-one share split last year that came into effect Dec.
24. The stock has rallied 53 percent this year, the fourth-best
performing company on the Nairobi Securities Exchange. The  NSE
All-Share Index (NSEASI)  has advanced 19 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
