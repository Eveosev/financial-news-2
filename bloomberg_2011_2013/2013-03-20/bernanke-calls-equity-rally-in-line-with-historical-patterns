Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the central bank isn’t targeting asset prices with
its monetary policy, calling the stock market’s recent rally in
line with historical patterns.  “We are not measuring success in terms of the stock
market” even as “we do monitor the entire financial system”
including equity markets, he said at a press conference today in
Washington. “We don’t see anything that’s out of line with
historical patterns. While the Dow may be hitting a high, it is
is nominal terms” not real terms, he said.  “There has been increased optimism about the economy” and
the share of income going to profits has risen, so higher stock
prices aren’t surprising, Bernanke said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which was 0.7 percent
higher at 1,558.52 at 3:31 p.m. in  New York , has advanced 9.3
percent this year. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  reached a
record this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
