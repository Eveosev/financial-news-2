BG Group Plc (BG/) , the U.K.’s third-
largest natural gas-producer, agreed to a long-term sale of
liquefied natural gas to India.  BG will supply state-owned  Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. (GSPC) 
with as much as 2.5 million tons a year of LNG, the Reading,
U.K.-based company said today in a statement. BG will initially
sell 1.25 million tons a year in 2015, and the contract will run
for up to 20 years, it said.  India, one of the world’s fastest-growing large economies,
consumes almost 35 percent more gas than it produces, according
to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Asian prices for
LNG currently trade at about $16.79 per million British Thermal
Units, compared with as low as $3.49 in the U.S, according to
data from Poten & Partners.  “We have been active in  India  for more than 15 years and
it is a large and important market that we understand well,” BG
Chief Executive Officer Chris Finlayson said. “We expect the
country to lie third among LNG importing countries by 2025,
behind Japan and  China .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
