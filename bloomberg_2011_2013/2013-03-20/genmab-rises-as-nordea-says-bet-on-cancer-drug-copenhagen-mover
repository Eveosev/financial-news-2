Genmab A/S (GEN)  rose the most in a week
in Copenhagen trading after Nordea Bank AB said an experimental
cancer treatment that the Danish company is developing with
 Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  will boost the share price.  Genmab rose 4.2 percent,  the most since  March 13, to 125.40
kroner at 12:40 p.m. in the Danish capital, with trading volume
at 143 percent of the three-month daily average.  Findings presented at a scientific session that Nordea
hosted confirm Genmab’s daratumumab is “a clearly unique
asset” in the growing market for treating multiple myeloma, the
bank said. Nordea repeated a strong buy recommendation on the
shares of the Copenhagen-based drugmaker.  “We believe that daratumumab could be the next big thing
in multiple myeloma,” Michael Novod, an analyst with Nordea in
Copenhagen, said in the note.  The market for multiple myeloma is “set to grow rapidly,”
approaching $9 billion in 2020 amid better diagnosis and
treatment of the disease, Novod said. The cancer starts in the
plasma cells in bone marrow.  Genmab and partner J&J, which is based in  New Brunswick ,
 New Jersey , are discussing “all options” for speeding up
regulatory approval of daratumumab, Chief Executive officer Jan Van de Winkel said in a March 7 phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
