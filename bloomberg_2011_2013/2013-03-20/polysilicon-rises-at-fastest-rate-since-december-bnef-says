The price of polysilicon, the raw
material for most solar panels, rose 3.4 percent last week at
the fastest rate since it hit a record low in December,
Bloomberg New Energy Finance data show.  The average spot price of the material was $17.61 per
kilogram last week compared with $17.03 a week earlier, a survey
by the research firm shows. The price, which tumbled about 40
percent during 2012, has risen almost 10 percent
this year after producers reduced output to curb oversupply.  The spot price is recovering from its mid-December average
of $15.83 a kilogram, its lowest level in at least a decade.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
