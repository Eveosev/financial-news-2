U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said the government will commit 3.5 billion
pounds ($5.3 billion) to help new home buyers by offering and
guaranteeing loans.  The government will provide an equity loan of up to 20
percent of the value of a newly built home under the “Help to
Buy” program announced by Osborne in his annual budget report
to lawmakers today.  “Help to Buy is a dramatic intervention to get our housing
market moving,” Osborne said in the House of Commons. “For
newly built housing, government will put up a fifth of the cost,
and for anyone who can afford a mortgage but can’t afford a big
deposit, our mortgage guarantee will help you buy your own
home.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron  is using homebuilding to help
stimulate the economy, which is at risk of entering an
unprecedented triple-dip recession. The Bank of England’s
Funding for Lending Scheme has eased conditions in the home-loan
market and the government has also tried to bolster the housing
industry by simplifying planning laws.  A potential buyer would have to make a down payment of 5
percent to get the government loan, which is interest free for
five years and will be offered starting in April, Osborne said.
Loans will be made available to buyers of new homes valued under
600,000 pounds, he said.  The new program broadens an existing one beyond first-time
buyers and those who make less than 60,000 pounds a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
