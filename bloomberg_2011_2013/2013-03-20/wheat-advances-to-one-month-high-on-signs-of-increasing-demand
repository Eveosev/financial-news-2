Wheat futures advanced to the
highest level in almost a month on speculation this year’s slump
in prices is attracting buyers of the U.S. crop.  Wheat for May delivery gained as much as 0.9 percent to
$7.285 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, the costliest for
the most active contract since Feb. 22. Futures were at $7.2675
at 10:07 a.m. Singapore time on a trading volume that was 50
percent above the 100-day average for that time of day.  Japan  is planning to buy 76,848 metric tons of U.S. wheat
at a tender tomorrow, the agriculture ministry said yesterday.
Tunisia is seeking to buy 67,000 tons of soft wheat for delivery
in May, the state grains agency said.  “We see a lot of demand for U.S. wheat from importers,
which is supporting the market,” Joyce Liu, an analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte. said by phone from Singapore today.  Corn for May delivery lost 0.1 percent to $7.28 a bushel in
Chicago, while soybeans for delivery in the same month gained
0.7 percent to $14.16 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
