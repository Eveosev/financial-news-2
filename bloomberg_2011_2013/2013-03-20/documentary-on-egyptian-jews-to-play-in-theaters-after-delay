A documentary about  Egypt ’s Jews
will play at three local movie theaters next week after security
officials held up its screening, the director said.  Makers of “Jews of Egypt” have been cleared to screen the
film starting March 27, director Amir Ramses said today by
phone. Ramses, who has accused Egyptian authorities of targeting
the movie because of its content, said it was regrettable that
after the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak ’s autocratic regime,
“security agencies still have a right to block films.”  The movie’s scheduled March 13 screening in theaters was
called off after security officials delayed authorization,
producer Haitham Al Khamissi said in a statement earlier this
month. Censorship official Abdel Sattar Fathy said at the time
that the documentary makers scheduled the screening before
receiving a permit and that he was pressing security agencies to
clear it for screening.  The documentary examines how the Jews of Egypt were
transformed “in the eyes of Egyptians from partners in the same
countries to enemies,” during the first half of the 20th
century, according to its website.  “I think the word ‘Jews’ still sparks security concerns,”
said Ramses, the director.  Fathy reiterated today that authorization was a routine
procedure.  Egypt’s once-vibrant Jewish community has nearly
disappeared since  Israel ’s creation in 1948, with many escaping
hostility, expulsions and attacks fueled by the Arab-Israeli
wars. Fewer than 100 live in Egypt today, down from 75,000 in
1948, according to the Jewish Virtual Library, an online
encyclopedia.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
