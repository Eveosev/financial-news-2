Somalia’s new government, greater
naval cooperation and more armed security aboard ships has cut
piracy to the point that pirates have had no successful hijacks
this year, according to a group formed to stop the attacks.  Somali pirates tried and failed to seize two ships in the
 Gulf of Aden  in 2013, after incidents fell almost fourfold to 36
last year versus 2011, said  James Hughes , co-chairman of the
Contact Group on Piracy Off the Coast of Somalia.  “The international community needs to continue with its
efforts to ensure sufficient force generation,” he said today
in an interview in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. The joint
operation of around 20 ships drawn from navies from the European
Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Russia and  China 
and others, is an “unprecedented level” of multilateral
cooperation, Hughes said.  The cost of piracy off Somalia in 2011 was estimated at
$6.9 billion, including $1.3 billion spent on military
operations and $1.2 billion on armed guards and vessel security,
according to a report in February last year by  One Earth Future
Foundation .  To contact the reporter on this story:
