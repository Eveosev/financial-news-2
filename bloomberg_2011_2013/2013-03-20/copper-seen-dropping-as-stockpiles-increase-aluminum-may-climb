Copper is poised to decline 2
percent this year as supply outpaces demand and boosts
stockpiles, while aluminum may advance as demand gains, said
 Australia ’s Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics.  Copper may average $7,788 a metric ton in 2013 from $7,948
a year earlier, the Canberra-based  bureau  said in a report
today. The bureau in December forecast $7,675 for this year.
World inventories may surge 16 percent to 1.3 million tons in
2013, or three weeks of consumption, it said. That compares with
a December forecast of 1.1 million tons.  Prices fell to a seven-month low yesterday on concerns that
 Europe ’s debt turmoil will damp the economy and property curbs
will erode demand in  China , the biggest user. The country’s
industrial output had the weakest start to a year since 2009 and
copper imports slid to the lowest in 20 months in February, when
there was a weeklong New Year holiday. Stockpiles are rising at
an “alarming” rate, Barclays Plc said March 18.  “Copper consumption is forecast to grow, primarily in
emerging economies, but by a lower amount than the increase in
production,” today’s report said. “The increase in supply will
come from a number of large recently commissioned mines in
Indonesia, Peru and Mongolia ramping up to full production.”  Copper for delivery in three months slipped as much 1.2
percent to $7,486.25 a ton on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday, the lowest level since Aug. 21. The metal traded at
$7,577 at 10:02 a.m. Singapore time today.  Aluminum may average $2,075 a ton in 2013 from $2,017 last
year as consumption increases, the bureau said. That compares
with a December estimate of $2,118 for 2013. Alumina, the
principal raw material in aluminum, may average $342 a ton this
year from $319 in 2012.  Nickel may average $17,586 a ton in 2013 from $17,505 last
year, the report said. Zinc may average $1,983 a ton this year
from $1,947 last year, it said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
