Chile ’s government will develop a
municipal desalination plant for the city of Copiapo in the
Atacama Desert after growing demand for water dried out aquifers
and led to rationing last year.  The government will bring the first stage of the plant
online in 2017 and a second stage by 2024, Magaly Espinosa, the
country’s superintendent of water services, said at the  Water
Week Latin America  conference in Vina Del Mar, Chile today.  Chile rationed water supply to Copiapo’s 158,438 residents
last year after 27 aquifers were exhausted, forcing the
government to seek a deal with mining companies  Anglo American
Plc (AAL)  and  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  to share their water
rights with the city. Both companies are also building
desalination plants to run their copper mines in the Atacama
region.  “We can assure clients that there will be enough supply,”
Espinosa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
