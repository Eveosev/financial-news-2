Uganda ’s revenue in the first seven
months of the 2012-13 financial year fell 2.5 percent below
target as lower oil imports reduced duties, the Uganda Revenue
Authority said.  Tax collection in East Africa’s third-biggest economy from
July through February amounted to 4.57 trillion shillings ($1.73
billion), the agency said in an e-mailed statement from Kampala,
the capital. The deficit for the period is 115 billion
shillings, it said.  The nation’s oil imports in February declined 2.1 percent
from a year earlier because of problems at neighboring Kenya’s
Mombasa port, Uganda’s gateway to the sea, the agency said.
Gasoline imports declined 6.1 percent to 39.1 million liters,
while diesel dropped 6 percent to 59.3 million liters from a
year ago levels, the authority said.  Uganda, which relies on donors including U.S., U.K,
Germany, European Union, Denmark,  Norway  and Japan to fund a
quarter of its annual budget, targets collecting 7.2 trillion
shillings in taxes this year, according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
