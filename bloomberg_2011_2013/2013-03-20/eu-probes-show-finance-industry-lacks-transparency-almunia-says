European Union investigations into
Libor rates and the credit-default swap market show the
financial industry has a “worrying” lack of transparency, the
European Union’s competition chief said.  “As long as the industry remains so opaque, the temptation
will also remain to flout competition rules,” EU Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in a speech in  Melbourne 
today. “And when companies yield to it, the European Commission
will intervene. The industry needs a genuine change of
culture.”  The EU regulator in Brussels is investigating possible
collusion between Markit Group Ltd. and 16 investment banks
including  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
after suspending a parallel probe into clearing deals between
nine of the lenders and ICE Clear  Europe .  Almunia said today that the EU regulators in their probe of
the credit-default swap market “want to make sure that a number
of large investment banks have not prevented the development of
trading platforms for CDS.”  Separately, the commission is also probing manipulation of
benchmark  interest rates  such as the London Interbank Offered
Rate and Euribor.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS)  have all said they were quizzed by the EU over benchmark
interest rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
