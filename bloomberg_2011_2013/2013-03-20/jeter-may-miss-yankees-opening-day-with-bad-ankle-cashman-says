Derek Jeter may miss the  New York 
Yankees’ opening game of the Major League Baseball season as he
recovers from a broken ankle that required surgery, General
Manager Brian Cashman said today.  Cashman spoke to reporters at the Yankees’ spring training
camp a day after Jeter, the team’s captain and All-Star
shortstop, was pulled from the lineup with soreness and
stiffness in his left ankle.  “It’s a possibility,” Cashman said. Jeter has said
repeatedly that he will be ready for the regular season.  The Yankees, who open the season at home against the Boston
Red Sox on April 1, already are without first basemen Mark
Teixeira and outfielder Curtis Granderson at least through May,
and third baseman Alex Rodriguez through midseason.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
