U.S.  stocks  rose, snapping a three-
day decline in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as the  Federal
Reserve  will keep up its bond buying to stimulate the economy
and euro-area leaders weighed options for Cyprus.  Homebuilders rallied, as  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  gained 4.8 percent
after posting first-quarter  earnings  that beat projections.
Adobe Systems Inc. climbed 4.2 percent as the software maker
reported sales and profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates.
 FedEx (FDX)  Corp. slumped 6.9 percent as it lowered its 2013 earnings
forecast amid a widening customer shift to cheaper overseas
shipments. Oracle Corp. tumbled 7.5 percent after the close of
regular trading as sales and profit missed estimates.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  advanced 0.7 percent to 1,558.71 at 4 p.m. in
 New York , trading within seven points of its record reached in
2007. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 55.91 points, or 0.4
percent, to 14,511.73. About 5.9 billion shares traded hands on
U.S. exchanges today, 6.3 percent below the three-month average.  “The Fed essentially did what’s to be expected, which is
to reinforce that the economy still needs support,” Hank Herrmann,  Overland Park , Kansas-based chief executive officer of
Waddell & Reed Investment Management Co., said in a phone
interview. His firm manages $103 billion. “Cyprus just reminds
us all the fragility of the economic circumstances in  Europe . As
you look at the economic data, pretty much everywhere outside
the U.S. has been equally unconvincing in terms of any kind of
expansion.”  More than three years into the expansion, the central bank
led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  is pressing on with open-ended
purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities to boost the pace
of growth and heal a labor market still scarred by the deepest
recession since the Great Depression.  Bull Market  The S&P 500 has  surged 130 percent  from a 12-year low in
2009 as companies reported better-than-estimated earnings and
the Fed embarked on three rounds of bond purchases to stimulate
the economy. The benchmark index rose to within two points of
its 2007 record last week while the Dow hit an all-time high.  The  Federal Open Market Committee , at the conclusion of a
two-day meeting in  Washington , left unchanged its statement that
it plans to hold its target interest rate near zero as long as
 unemployment  remains above 6.5 percent and inflation is
projected to be no more than 2.5 percent.  Policy makers lowered their expectations for the
 unemployment rate  at the end of the year to a range of 7.3
percent to 7.5 percent, from a previous forecast of 7.4 percent
to 7.7 percent. The economy will expand 2.3 percent to 2.8
percent this year, they estimate, compared with their earlier
forecast of 2.3 percent to 3 percent growth.  Cyprus Rejection  Stocks rallied earlier today as euro-area leaders weighed
options for Cyprus. Investors speculated that the  European
Central Bank  will continue to support the country’s banks until
next week, after lawmakers in the Mediterranean nation rejected
an unprecedented levy on  bank deposits .  “In a lot of ways what’s happening in Cyprus only serves
to reinforce the Fed’s current policy,” Richard Helm, a
portfolio manager at New York-based Cohen & Steers, which
oversees more than $40 billion, said in a phone interview. “It
puts to bed that the Fed might raise rates sooner than later if
you do have issues re-emerging in Europe.”  Nine of 10  S&P 500  groups  gained  as consumer companies
climbed the most, rising at least 1 percent. The Chicago Board
Options Exchange  Volatility Index (VIX) , which measures the cost of
using options as insurance against declines in the S&P 500, slid
12 percent to 12.67, after a 27 percent jump over two days. The
gauge, known as the VIX, is down 30 percent this year.  Homebuilders Rally  An S&P index of  homebuilders  climbed 3.7 percent to the
highest level since July 2007. Builders are benefiting from
revived demand for new homes as the inventory of existing houses
for sale shrinks and buyers take advantage of  mortgage rates 
that are close to record lows.  Lennar jumped 4.8 percent to $43.40. The third-biggest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue said earnings rose in the fiscal first
quarter as prices and sales increased amid the broadening
national housing recovery.  Toll Brothers Inc., the largest U.S. luxury-home builder,
added 5.9 percent to $36.53. Orders are up 49 percent for the
spring, Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley said today on
Bloomberg Television.  A Bloomberg gauge of U.S.  airlines  gained 2.3 percent to
49.90, its highest level since February 2008. The airline group
IATA said global airlines are on track to post profit 40 percent
higher than the previous year, due to strong passenger demand,
cargo improvement and industry consolidation in domestic
markets.  Airlines Surge  Alaska Air Group Inc. surged 3.4 percent to a record $63,
while Delta Air Lines Inc. jumped 3.2 percent to $17.07. U.S.
Airways Group added 2.7 percent to $17.23, the highest level
since 2007.  Adobe (ADBE)  gained 4.2 percent to $42.46, as the maker of
Photoshop software reported sales for the quarter ended March 1
of $1.01 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $985.8
million. Profit excluding some items was 35 cents a share,
exceeding the average analyst projection of 31 cents.  BlackBerry, formerly Research In Motion Ltd., increased 6.5
percent to $16. Morgan Stanley raised its rating on the
Canadian-based phone company to overweight from underweight. The
BlackBerry 10 device may boost gross margins and average selling
prices, Morgan Stanley analyst Ehud Gelblum said in a note.  Discount Retailers  Family Dollar Stores Inc. rallied 3.8 percent to $60.36,
pacing gains among discount retailers. Dollar Tree Inc. advanced
4 percent to $46.16, while Dollar General Corp. rose 4.2 percent
to $49.79.  FedEx fell 6.9 percent to $99.13. The operator of the
world’s largest cargo airline said profit in the fiscal year
through May will be $6 to $6.20 a share, down from an earlier
forecast of as much as $6.60. Both the projection and fiscal
third-quarter profit trailed analysts estimates.  The company, an economic bellwether because it moves goods
as varied as medical supplies and auto parts, is in the midst of
a $1.7 billion restructuring to compensate for customers moving
away from the fastest, most lucrative deliveries. Starting in
April, it will decrease capacity to and from  Asia  and put low-
yielding shipments in less expensive networks, Chief Executive
Officer  Fred Smith  said.  Oracle Corp. tumbled 7.5 percent to $33.10 as of 4:50 p.m.
in New York. The company posted fiscal third-quarter sales and
profit that missed analysts’ estimates as customers chose
competitors’ Web-based software.  Cintas Corp. dropped 4.5 percent to $43.88 after the
provider of restroom supplies and entrance mats said it expects
full-year earnings per share of $2.50 to $2.54. That compares
with a previous forecast of $2.50 to $2.58.  To contact the reporters on this story:
