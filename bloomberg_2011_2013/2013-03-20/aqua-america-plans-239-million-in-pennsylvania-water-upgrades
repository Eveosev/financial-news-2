Aqua America Inc. (WTR) , the second-
largest U.S. water utility by market value, is planning $239
million in infrastructure upgrades across  Pennsylvania  in 2013,
mostly in Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties.  The projects underscore efforts “to renew and rehabilitate
our water and wastewater systems and replace the aging areas of
our distribution systems that deliver water to our customers
throughout the Commonwealth,” said Aqua Pennsylvania Inc. unit
President Steve Tagert in today’s statement. Last year the
company spent $259 million on improvements in the state.  The announcement comes a day after the U.S. drinking water
and sewage infrastructure earned a barely passing grade of D
from the American Society of Civil Engineers. American Water
Works Co. is the biggest U.S. water utility. Aqua America is
based in  Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania.  To contact the reporter on this story:
