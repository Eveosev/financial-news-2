J.C. Penney Co. (JCP) , which last week
asked a Delaware judge to schedule a trial in April over its
dispute with bondholders threatening to declare the company in
technical default, said today it received a letter from holders’
lawyers withdrawing and rescinding the default.  J.C. Penney sued bondholders Feb. 4 after lawyers claiming
to represent holders of more than 50 percent of its 7.4 percent
notes due in 2037 accused the company of defaulting by signing a
credit agreement in January 2012 without providing proper
security for investors. Bondholders set a May 5 deadline to
remedy the alleged default, J.C. Penney said in its complaint.  The company said in a filing last month in Delaware
Chancery Court that the improper default claims could put the
company at risk of demands for payment on more than $2.8 billion
in debt. The company’s credit ratings have been slashed in the
past year as Chief Executive Officer  Ron Johnson ’s turnaround
plan struggles to take hold.  J.C. Penney has $325.6 million of the 7.4 percent notes
outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt
traded March 19 at 81 cents on the dollar to yield 9.408
percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The case is J.C. Penney Co. Inc. v. US Bank National
Association as Indenture Trustee, 8276, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
