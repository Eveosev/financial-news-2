The U.S. is offering as much as $10
million for information on two American citizens with ties to
the Somalia-based terrorist group al-Shabaab, the FBI said
 today .  The rewards from the U.S. State Department total $5 million
apiece for intelligence leading to the arrests or convictions of
Jehad Mostafa, a former resident of San Diego, California, and
Omar Hammami, a former resident of Daphne,  Alabama , the Federal
Bureau of Investigation announced. Both individuals are on the
FBI’s Most Wanted Terrorist list.  Hammami was indicted by a federal court in Alabama in
September 2009 on charges that included providing material
support to al-Shabaab. He moved to Somalia in 2006 and has
served as a propagandist for al-Qaeda linked al-Shabaab, helping
recruit English-speaking youth through writings, rap songs and
video statements, State Department officials said.  Mostafa was indicted in October 2009 on similar charges by
a federal court in  California . He re-located to Somalia in 2005
and has served as a “media expert” and leader of foreign
fighters for al-Shabaab, according to the State Department.  The State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security
operates the Rewards for Justice program, which since its
inception in 1984 has paid out more than $125 million for
information resulting in the arrests or convictions of alleged
terrorists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
