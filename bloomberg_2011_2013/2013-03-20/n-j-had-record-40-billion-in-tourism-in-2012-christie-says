New Jersey had a record $40 billion
of tourism in 2012, even with  Hurricane Sandy , Governor Chris
Christie said.  Visitor spending, capital investment and general government
support of tourism surpassed the previous record of $39.5
billion reached in 2007, a 2.6 percent increase over 2011,
according to Christie’s office.  Most damaged boardwalks will be rebuilt and open by
Memorial Day, Christie told reporters today in Atlantic City.  “While these 2012 results are positive and encouraging, we
are still facing the challenges of the aftermath of Superstorm
Sandy,” Christie said. “We must continue to look to the future
and continue the steady progress of rebuilding.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
