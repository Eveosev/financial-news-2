Kenya ’s shilling weakened the most
in two weeks as businesses sought dollars for their month-end
obligations and on continued concern over a challenge to the
presidential election result.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy retreated as
much as 0.4 percent, the most since March 6, to 85.80 per dollar
and traded 0.2 percent down at 85.60 by 1:10 p.m. in the
capital, Nairobi.  Outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga, whose dispute of the
2007 election triggered ethnic clashes that left more than 1,100
people dead, filed a petition on March 16, challenging the
victory of Uhuru Kenyatta in the March 4 ballot. The nation’s
highest court, which has 14 days to rule, held its first seating
today and scheduled a pre-trial conference on March 25, Chief
Justice Willy Mutunga told reporters.  “The shilling has weakened on growing demand for dollars
as businesses prepare to settle their end month bills,”
Jeremiah Kendagor, head of trading at Nairobi-based Kenya
Commercial Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview. “The ongoing
presidential petition brings uncertainty in the market.”  The shilling rose 0.9 percent from the March 4 vote to
March 13, when demand for dollars picked up after business
resumed.  The Central Bank of Kenya offered 12 billion shillings
($140 million) in seven-day repurchase agreements, an official
who asked not to be identified in line with policy said by phone
today. The bank uses the repos to reduce money supply and
support the shilling.  Uganda’s currency weakened 0.5 percent to 2,639.50 per
dollar, while the Tanzanian shilling weakened 0.8 percent to
1,637.70 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
