(Corrects company in headline, second paragraph.)  Bolivia ’s President Evo Morales
reduced electricity rates in the capital by 60 percent after
seizing assets from Spain’s  Red Electrica de Espana SAU , state
news agency  ABI  reported.  Electricity rates in La Paz were cut to 60 centavos (9
cents) a kilowatt-hour from 1.50 bolivianos  after a unit of
state power company  Empresa Nacional de Electricidad  took over
Red Electrica’s four units in Bolivia, ABI said, citing Morales.  Morales said the state company known as Delapaz will invest
11 million bolivianos in Iberdrola’s assets, which the
government seized in May 2012, according to the news agency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
