Elisa Oyj (ELI1V) , Finland’s largest
wireless carrier by subscribers, fell the most in six weeks as
Nordea Bank AB warned aggressive promotional offers may eat away
at first-quarter margins.  Elisa fell as much as 2 percent, the biggest intraday drop
since Feb. 7 and the largest decline among  Finnish benchmark
stocks , and lost 1.7 percent to 16.39 euros at 12:32 p.m. in
Helsinki. Volume exceeded 460,000 shares, about 81 percent of
the three-month daily average.  “We are increasingly concerned about the impact on Elisa
of continued campaigning,” Sami Sarkamies, an analyst at Nordea
in Helsinki, said today in a note. He downgraded his
recommendation to sell from hold, lowering the 12-month price
estimate to 15 euros from 17 euros. “Elisa’s soft third quarter
and especially fourth quarter reports managed to raise eyebrows
after several years of it performing like clockwork.”  Elisa’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization fell to 123.8 million euros ($160 million) in the
fourth quarter from 129.7 million euros a year earlier, missing
analysts’ estimates.  Promotions, including two-year mobile packages with the
first year discounted by as much as 50 percent, have continued
through January and February with some signs of easing during
late March, Sarkamies said.  “While the market has remained healthy owing to a surging
mobile broadband market, slowing subscriber growth could spark
unhealthy competitive action,” Sarkamies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
