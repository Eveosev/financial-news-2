German stocks  advanced, rebounding
from a three-day decline, as European policy makers weighed
options for Cyprus after lawmakers rejected a bank deposit levy.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and Commerzbank AG gained at least 1
percent as a gauge of lenders rose the second most of the 19
groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)  HeidelbergCement AG
advanced to its highest price since October 2008, following a
measure of European construction companies higher.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  gained 0.7 percent to 8,001.97 at the close
of trading in  Frankfurt . The gauge has risen 5.1 percent this
year as reports pointed to a strengthening global economy amid
speculation that central banks will maintain stimulus measures.
The broader HDAX Index increased 0.6 percent today.  “Cyprus is in the center of the discussions after the
local parliament denied the short-term solution,” Roger Peeters, chief executive officer at Close Brothers Seydler
Research in Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mail. “It will be
important for the  capital markets  that politicians in the  euro
zone  find a solution soon. Cyprus is small but the announcement
effect should not be underestimated.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the DAX
was 16 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden has called for the
17 euro-area finance ministers to reconvene as soon as possible
to put together a new package for Cyprus, after the country’s
lawmakers rejected the bank levy, throwing into limbo a bailout
package designed to keep Cyprus in the euro.  Banks Advance  Deutsche Bank AG,  Germany ’s biggest lender, gained 1.4
percent to 32.44 euros.  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the country’s second
largest, increased 1.2 percent to 1.21 euros.  HeidelbergCement, the world’s third-largest cement maker,
advanced 2.4 percent to 58.17 euros as a gauge of European
construction companies rose the most on the Stoxx 600.  Dialog Semiconductor Plc (DLG) , a creator of energy-efficient,
highly integrated mixed signal circuits, added 4.7 percent to
12.24 euros. Berenberg Bank AG upgraded the shares to buy from
hold, citing full-year 2012 results that alleviated concern
about the company’s development costs, acquisition risks and
valuation.  Metro AG slipped 2.4 percent to 22.38 euros, paring
yesterday’s gains. Germany’s biggest retailer forecast a decline
in operating profit as it invests in its Cash & Carry unit and
the economy remains challenging in southern and eastern  Europe .  Rheinmetall AG (RHM)  slid 6.9 percent to 38.14 euros, its biggest
decline since November 2011. The automotive, electronics,
defense and engineering group forecast earnings before interest
and taxes will fall to as little as 240 million euros in 2013
from 301 million euros in 2012, because of restructuring costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
