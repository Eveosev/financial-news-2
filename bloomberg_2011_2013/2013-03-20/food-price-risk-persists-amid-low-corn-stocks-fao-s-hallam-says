Agricultural markets face more
risks that could drive food prices up rather than down this
year amid low corn stocks, said David Hallam, director of trade
and markets at the Food & Agriculture Organization.  “It’s wrong to assume that everything’s back to normal,”
Hallam said in an interview in Geneva yesterday. “There are
still worrying signs, maize stocks are very low. There are still
upside risks, more upside than downside.”  The FAO’s index of world  food prices  fell for a fifth month
in February on a decline in grain prices. Corn prices in  Chicago 
have dropped 9.8 percent from a peak in August last year on an
outlook for increased U.S. planting.  While the United Nations’ FAO index has dropped 12 percent
from a February 2011 record, the gauge has more than doubled
from a decade ago. The FAO expects commodity crops to remain
more expensive than before the 2007-08 food crisis on slowing
productivity gains and as biofuels have become profitable
independent of government policies, Hallam said.  “We’ve been saying ever since 2007-08, we don’t expect
prices to fall back to pre-2006 levels,” Hallam said. “The
slowdown in yield growth is not going to be reversed overnight
and biofuels are not going to go away. And they’ve been putting
a floor under the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
