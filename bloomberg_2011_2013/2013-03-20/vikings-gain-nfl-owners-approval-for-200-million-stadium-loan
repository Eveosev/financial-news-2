National Football League owners
agreed to loan the  Minnesota Vikings  $200 million toward the
cost of a new $975 million stadium in downtown  Minneapolis .  “This significant portion of financing is a major step
forward for the stadium project,” Jeff Anderson, a spokesman
for the Vikings, said last night in an e-mail. “We’re thrilled
to have the NFL’s full confidence and support.”  The NFL’s 32 owners voted at a meeting in Phoenix to help
finance the project from the league’s stadium fund, after the
Vikings last year agreed with state and local government
officials on a deal for taxpayers to pay about $498 million.  The state will contribute about $348 million of the
building costs, using gambling money. The city will redirect
$150 million from existing convention center and tourism taxes
to build the stadium and about $7.5 million a year to run it.  The Vikings agreed to pay $477 million, including the $200
million from the NFL, for construction costs and about $13
million a year for operating and capital expenses at the
stadium, which will be built on the site of the Metrodome.  The loan will be repaid from a portion of premium-seat
revenue at the new stadium.  Construction work is scheduled to begin in the third
quarter of this year and be completed in time for the 2016 NFL
season.  Greg Aiello  and  Brian McCarthy , spokesmen for the NFL,
didn’t immediately reply to e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
