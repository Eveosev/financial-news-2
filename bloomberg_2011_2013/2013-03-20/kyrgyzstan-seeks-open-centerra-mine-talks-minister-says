(Corrects amount of claim in last paragraph.)  Kyrgyzstan will renegotiate a 2009
project agreement with  Canada ’s  Centerra Gold Inc. (CG)  for its
Kumtor mine in an open and transparent manner, said Economy
Minister Temir Sariev.  “The government’s standpoint of view is, ‘let’s work on it
with accordance with the law,’” Sariev said yesterday in an
interview in  Hong Kong  through a translator. “Nobody is talking
about closure of the mining site or stopping the operation.”  Centerra’s shares have dropped 33 percent in Toronto this
year after the Kyrgyz parliament resolved that the project
agreements for Kumtor should be renegotiated. The company has
operated the mine, 33 percent held by the government, since 1997,
according to a  presentation  on its website.  Centerra is in “constructive dialogue” with the nation,
John Pearson, vice president of  investor relations , said
yesterday in Hong Kong.  The company also said last month it had received a claim
for about $315 million from the Kyrgyz State Agency for
Environmental Protection and Forestry for alleged environmental
damages at the project. The mine is expected to produce 600,000
ounces of gold this year, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
