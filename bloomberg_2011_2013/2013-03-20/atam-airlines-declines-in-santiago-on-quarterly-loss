Latam Airlines Group SA (LAN) , the
airline created by the merger of Chile’s Lan and  Brazil ’s Tam,
dropped to the lowest since 2011 as deal-related costs led to a
bigger-than-expected loss.  Latam fell 1.8 percent to 10,570 pesos at 12:16 p.m. in
Santiago, which would be its lowest closing price since October
2011. The  Ipsa (IPSA)  benchmark index advanced 0.1 percent.  The carrier reported yesterday a net loss attributable to
shareholders of $51.1 million in the fourth quarter, compared
with profit of $115 million a year earlier. The average  estimate 
of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a loss of $32.5
million.  “Merger costs and the level of synergies obtained affected
profit,” analysts at the brokerage unit of Chilean lender Banco
de Credito & Inversiones said in an e-mailed note today. “The
company’s performance and the challenges reaching its cost-
saving goals will lead us to review our estimates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
