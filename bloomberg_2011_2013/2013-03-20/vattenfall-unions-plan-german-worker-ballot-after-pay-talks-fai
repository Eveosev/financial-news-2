Vattenfall AB’s German workers will
be balloted on possible labor protests after three unions said
talks on pay and  job security  collapsed.  The electricity company’s proposals on preserving
positions, training and wages, presented in a third round of
negotiations covering 15,000 employees, were all unacceptable,
the IG BCE, Ver.di and IG Metall unions said in a joint
statement.  The company offered raises of 2.75 percent for this year
and 1.75 percent 2014, as well as terms for avoiding mass
firings through February 2016 in any reorganization, Stockholm-
based Vattenfall’s German unit said in a separate statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
