Repsol SA’s Petronor refinery in
Bilbao,  Spain , started a desulfurization unit and three other
plants after maintenance, according to a company official.  Desulfurization unit G4 resumed yesterday, and sulfur
recovery unit SR3B, hydrodesulfurizer HD3 and hydrogen
production unit H4 restarted on March 6, the official said in an
e-mailed response to questions, asking not to be identified in
line with corporate policy. The units were halted on March 2,
the company said earlier this month.  The Bilbao refinery can process 220,000 barrels of crude a
day, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
