The Healthcare of Ontario Pension
Plan, a pension fund manager in  Canada ’s most populous province,
posted a 17 percent return on investments in 2012, led by U.S.
stocks, international equities and real estate.  Investment income was about C$6.8 billion ($6.6 billion)
last year, compared with C$4.2 billion in 2011, according to
Chief Executive Officer Jim Keohane. HOOPP, as the fund is
known, managed a record C$47.4 billion in assets as of Dec. 31,
up from C$40.3 billion a year earlier, the Toronto-based fund
manager said today in a statement.  “2012 really was an exceptional year, everything came
together and all the positioning we had worked well,” Keohane
said in a telephone interview from Toronto. “I don’t expect
that’s going to happen every year.”  HOOPP’s results topped the 10 percent return of Ontario
Municipal Employees Retirement System and the 9.6 percent return
of Caisse de Depot et Placement du  Quebec , Canada’s largest
pension fund manager. HOOPP beat the 9.4 percent median return
of Canadian pension funds in 2012, based on a Jan. 29 report by
Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Investor Services unit.  Keohane said he’s being “selective” in looking for
investments around the world as he doesn’t see valuations
“being particularly attractive at the moment” for assets
including private equity.  Commercial real estate, an asset that returned more than 18
percent last year for HOOPP, is still of interest.  “We are looking at things outside of Canada,” Keohane
said. “We see better values in  Europe , there’s a lot of
dislocation in Europe so there’s some decent stuff available
there at the moment.”  HOOPP oversees retirement funds for 274,000 nurses, medical
technicians, food services staff, laundry workers and other
healthcare workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
