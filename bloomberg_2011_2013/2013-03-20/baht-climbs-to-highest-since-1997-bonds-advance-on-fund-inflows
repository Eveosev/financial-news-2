Thailand ’s baht rose to its
strongest level since July 1997 and government bonds advanced
for a seventh day as the nation’s improving economy attracts
overseas capital.  The baht’s gains are being driven by the inflows, Bank of
Thailand Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said yesterday, adding
that the central bank will closely monitor the currency, which
has seen the biggest advance in Asia this year. Global funds
bought $2.4 billion more sovereign debt than they sold this
month through yesterday after net purchases of $2.7 billion in
February and $3.7 billion in January, data from the Thai Bond
Market Association show.  “The economy is very solid and the central bank seems to
be quite tolerant with the baht’s gains,” said Kozo Hasegawa, a
foreign-exchange trader in Bangkok at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corp. “But because the pace of appreciation was so fast, the
tolerance doesn’t mean they won’t intervene at all, and we may
see some correction soon.”  The baht climbed 0.5 percent to 29.18 per dollar as of 9:30
a.m. in Bangkok and has strengthened 4.8 percent this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It earlier touched the
1997 high of 29.15 and advanced 0.8 percent yesterday, the
biggest gain since Jan. 2.  Bond Sales  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.81 percent, the lowest
since Jan. 24.  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said March 11 that the
government is targeting annual economic growth of 4 percent to 5
percent over the long term, after a 6.4 percent expansion in
2012. The Bank of Thailand raised its 2013 forecast in January
to 4.9 percent from an October prediction of 4.6 percent and
signaled it will revise the estimate higher.  The government will sell 14 billion baht ($480 million) of
bonds due in 2019 and 6 billion baht of securities maturing in
2061 today, its debt sale calendar shows. The yield on 3.625
percent notes due June 2023 declined one basis point to 3.58
percent, the lowest level since Feb. 11, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
