Belgium’s capacity to generate
nuclear power will be halved by the end of this month as the
Tihange-1 reactor is shut down, L’Echo reported.  Tihange-1 will be closed from March 30 through May 21 for
maintenance, and the shut-down won’t affect customers, the
Brussels-based newspaper reported today, citing a spokesperson
for Electrabel SA, the Belgian subsidiary of  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA.  The Tihange-2 and Doel-3 reactors were shut down
previously, meaning that generation capacity will be halved for
a month or two, L’Echo reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
