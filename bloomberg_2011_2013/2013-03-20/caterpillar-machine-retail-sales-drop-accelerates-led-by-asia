Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the biggest maker
of construction and mining equipment, said global retail machine
sales fell 13 percent in the three months through February.  The drop was more than triple the 4 percent decline
reported in the three months through January, the Peoria,
Illinois-based company said today in a filing. Asia-Pacific
sales declined 26 percent from the same period a year earlier
while North American sales were 12 percent lower. The Europe,
Africa and Middle East region slid 9 percent.  Latin America  was
up 3 percent.  “It’s continued weakness,” Larry De Maria, a New York-
based analyst for William Blair & Co. who has the equivalent of
a buy rating on the shares, said in an interview today. Some
markets that were strong a year ago such as Asia “could reverse
in the second half,”  De Maria  said.  The bigger drop in the Asia-Pacific region may partly
reflect that the Chinese Lunar New Year was in February this
year while a year ago it was in January, he said. The market in
China, the world’s biggest for construction equipment, slows
down during the holiday festivities and picks up in the
following month, he said. China represents about 3 percent of
Caterpillar sales, according to the company.  Caterpillar fell 1.5 percent to $86.94 at the close in New
York, making it the worst performer on the 30-member  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  today. The shares have declined 3 percent
this year while the index rallied to a record 14,544 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
