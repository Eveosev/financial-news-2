Air Berlin Plc (AB1) ,  Europe ’s third-
biggest discount carrier, said a recovery plan will take longer
to execute because of high fuel prices and slow economic growth.  The additional challenges suggest the path to sustainable
profitability will be “longer than was expected,” the German
carrier said in its annual report today, though sales will rise
 this year  and the company is still seeking an operating profit.  Air Berlin will pare its fleet by 13 planes in 2013 while
pursuing 900 job cuts in a push to lift earnings by 400 million
euros ($418 million) by 2014. It posted net income for the first
time since 2007 last year only after selling control of its
frequent-flier program to No. 1 investor Etihad Airways PJSC.  “Despite the major progress we have achieved in reducing
our costs and increasing our efficiency, we have not yet reached
out goal, namely sustainable profitability,” Wolfgang Prock- Schauer, who took over as chief executive officer in October,
said in the report. The Berlin-based company needs to “further
reduce our costs” to be competitive, he added.  The fleet will be cut to 142 planes from 155 by the end of
2013, with eight aircraft arriving and 20 exiting, some via the
early termination of leases. Air Berlin plans to reduce capacity
by about 5 percent after cutting it 7.4 percent in 2012, when 15
jetliners were stood down, Chief Financial Officer Ulf Huettmeyer said at a press conference.  Suppliers and service providers are also being asked to
contribute to efforts to reduce expenses, the annual report
said. Reducing debt to about 500 million euros is also a major
objective this year for the company, which is cooperating more
closely with Etihad, whose CEO,  James Hogan , and chief financial
officer, James Rigney, sit on its board.  Air Berlin shares traded 1.5 percent lower at 2.52 euros as
of 1:43 p.m. in  Frankfurt  after earlier declining as much as 4.7
percent. The stock has advanced 64 percent so far this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
