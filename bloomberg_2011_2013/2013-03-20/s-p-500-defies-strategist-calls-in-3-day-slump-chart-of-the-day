Wall Street strategists predicted
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index will exceed the current record
just in time for its first three-day decline of the year.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how strategists’ average year-
end estimate in a Bloomberg survey compares with the  S&P 500 ’s
current value and the index’s closing high of 1,565.15, set on
Oct. 9, 2007.  After rising to within 0.1 percent of the peak on March 14,
the S&P 500 dropped 1 percent through yesterday. Strategists at
Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Morgan Stanley have raised year-end estimates in the
past week.  “It is hard to see what causes a major market
correction,”  Adam Parker , chief U.S. equity strategist at
Morgan Stanley, wrote in a report two days ago. Parker, based in
 New York , called for the S&P 500 to finish the year at 1,600. He
raised his forecast by 12 percent, the biggest percentage among
the four firms.  Strategists’ average year-end figure is 1,571, six points
higher than the closing record, according to the survey of 16
securities firms. The projection rose this week for the first
time since Jan. 31.  The most optimistic view belongs to  Sean Darby , Jefferies
Group LLC’s chief global equity strategist, whose year-end call
is at 1,673 after a 6.9 percent increase on March 12. Darby,
based in Hong Kong, was added to the survey this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
