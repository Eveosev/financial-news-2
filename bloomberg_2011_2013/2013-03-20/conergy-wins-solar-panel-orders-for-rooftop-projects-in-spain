Conergy AG (CGYK) , a German solar-energy
company, will supply 3.3 megawatts of solar panels to two
rooftop projects in Spain.  Conergy won orders from local developer Prosolia to supply
a 1.8-megawatt project in Sesena south of Madrid and a 1.5-
megawatt plant in Tenerifeâ€™s capital Santa Cruz, the Hamburg-
based company said today in an e-mailed statement, without
disclosing terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
