U.S. automakers and South Korean
affiliates  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)  and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  are boosting
their share of sales to younger U.S. buyers at the expense of
Japanese brands, according to a pair of market researchers.  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Chrysler Group LLC
increased their share of retail registrations to 18- to 24-year-
olds by 1.9 percentage points and to 25- to 34-year-olds by 1.5
points since 2008, according to R.L. Polk & Co. and Edmunds.com.
South Korean brands gained 6.8 points and 5.1 points worth of
share among those buyers last year.  After losing a generation of buyers to Japanese automakers
led by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and Honda Motor Co., GM, Ford and
Chrysler are gaining ground in the smaller car segments that
attract young American consumers. The Detroit automakers’ share
of the U.S. small and mid-sized car market will grow to 33
percent next year, from 26 percent in 2009, according to
researcher LMC Automotive.  “U.S. automakers have burst onto the scene in recent years
with small, fuel-efficient and affordable cars that really
appeal to a young set of buyers,” Jessica Caldwell, an analyst
with Santa Monica, California-based Edmunds, said in a
statement.  Japanese automakers led the industry by registering 42.6
percent of retail sales to 18- to 24-year-olds and 42.9 percent
to 25- to 34-year-olds last year, according to data compiled by
Polk. The brands lost 9.8 percentage points and 7.7 points of
share in those categories since 2008, the data show.  European automakers increased their share of retail sales
to 18- and 24-year-olds by 1.1 percentage points to 7.1 percent
and 25- to 34-year olds by 1 point to 9.8 percent since 2008,
according to the data.  U.S. auto sales may rise to 15.1 million this year from
14.5 million last year, the average estimate of 18 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg in January. In a separate survey,
analysts’ average estimates were for little change to market
share for GM, Ford, Toyota and Chrysler this year, with growth
led by  Volkswagen AG, (VOW)  Honda and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)   To contact the reporter on this story:
