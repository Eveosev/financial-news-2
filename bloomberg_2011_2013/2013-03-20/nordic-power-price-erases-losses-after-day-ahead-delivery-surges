Nordic power for next quarter
erased losses after the day-ahead price rose to the highest in
more than three months.  April-through-June contracts closed unchanged at 38.35
euros ($49.69) a megawatt-hour on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy
exchange in Oslo after falling as much as 1.3 percent. Power for
next month gained 1 percent to 41.35 euros.  Power for delivery around the clock  tomorrow  will cost
56.36 euros a megawatt-hour on average, following today’s
auction on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo. That’s the
highest since Dec. 12, and 16 percent more than the day-ahead
price set yesterday. It’s also below the financial contract for
tomorrow on Nasdaq OMX, which earlier closed at 50 euros.
Forward contracts frequently track movements in prompt prices.  “Cold weather and rising power use pushed tomorrow’s spot
price surprisingly high, with some analysts earlier predicting a
maximum price of 53 euros,” said Morten Tronsen, a trader at
Oslo-based Encatra AS. “The forward market is meanwhile
underpinned by a worsening hydrological balance, since
hydropower producers limit production to get a better price.”  The amount of water and snow available to generate
electricity in the region may be 21.2 terawatt-hours below
normal for the time of year in two weeks, down from minus 17.9
terawatt-hours today, Markedskraft data on Bloomberg showed.
Drier weather typically boosts prices because the region gets
more than half of its power from hydroelectric plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
