The pound reversed its decline
against the dollar after the minutes of the Bank of Englandâ€™s
policy meeting this month showed Governor Mervyn King was
defeated for a second month in a vote to expand stimulus.  Sterling gained 0.3 percent to $1.5139 at 9:41 a.m. London
time, after earlier slipping by as much as 0.5 percent. It was
little changed at 85.32 pence per euro, after earlier slipping
by as much as 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
