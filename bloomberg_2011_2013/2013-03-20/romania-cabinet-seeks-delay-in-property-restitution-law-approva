Romania wants to delay approval of
a property-restitution bill to confirm it satisfies the European
Court of  Human Rights , Prime Minster Victor Ponta said.  The Cabinet, which had planned to seek a confidence vote on
March 26 to speed the law’s approval, will ask the Strasbourg-
based court for an extra month to pass it, Ponta said today in a
televised speech in the capital, Bucharest.  “We want to have certainty that we won’t need to change
the legislation again,” he said. “That’s why we’ll hold
detailed talks with European specialists on the text of the law
before having it approved.”  Romania has set up  Fondul Proprietatea SA (FP) , which owns
shares in the country’s biggest companies including  OMV Petrom
SA (SNP) , to compensate citizens for property confiscated under
communism. Still, it continues to face lawsuits at the human-
rights court from citizens who’ve missed out on damage payments.
The court had asked the government to draw up a law to resolve
the matter by April 12.  Claims, comprising the return of property and cash
payments, may total 8 billion euros ($10.3 billion), the
government estimates. The budget won’t be affected before 2017,
when the cash payments will begin, Minister Delegate for Budget
Liviu Voinea said March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
