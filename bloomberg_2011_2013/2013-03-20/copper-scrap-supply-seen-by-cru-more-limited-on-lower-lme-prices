Supply of copper scrap has become
more limited since mid-February as lower prices of the refined
metal on the  London  Metal Exchange encouraged recyclers to
withhold supplies, according to researcher CRU.  Chinese smelters have found availability of scrap metal
“particularly tight,” Piotr Ortonowski, a consultant at CRU in
London, said by e-mail March 18.  “Chinese buyers are looking overseas to secure material,”
Ortonowski said. The U.S. is one source being considered in
China, and scrap supplies in the U.S. are “poor,” he said.  Copper for delivery in three months dropped to $7,486.25 a
metric ton on the London Metal Exchange yesterday, the lowest
level since Aug. 21 as European debt turmoil curbed demand for
commodities. The metal declined 4.3 percent in February and is
down 4.4 percent this year.  There has been more buying interest from  Asia  in  Europe 
with “little Chinese presence noted,” Ortonowski said. Most
scrap consumers in Europe have enough supplies, with weak demand
matched by poor supply, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
