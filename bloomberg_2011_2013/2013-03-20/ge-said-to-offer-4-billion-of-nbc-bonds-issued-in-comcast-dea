General Electric Co. (GE)  sold $4
billion of bonds issued by  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBCUniversal unit
after receiving the debt as a part of a $16.7 billion payment
for its remaining stake in the broadcaster.  NBC’s $700 million of three-year notes pay 50 basis points
more than the three-month London interbank offered  rate , while
an equal amount of five-year notes pay 68.5 basis points more
than the floating benchmark, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The broadcaster’s $1.1 billion of 1.662 percent,
five-year debt yields 85 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and a $1.5 billion portion of 1.974 percent bonds due
2019 pay a spread of 120 basis points.  A combination of senior unsecured debt with a weighted
average interest rate of 1.51 percent, along with cash and
preferred shares, was used to pay GE for selling its 49 percent
equity stake in NBC, Comcast said yesterday in a regulatory
filing announcing the deal’s completion. Comcast will back that
debt, with NBC paying the parent an annual guarantee fee.
Comcast had owned 51 percent of the business before agreeing in
February to buy GE’s stake.  The bonds were graded A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, the
ratings company said in a March 1 statement.  Libor, the rate at which banks say they can borrow from one
another, is the standard for about $360 trillion of financial
products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
