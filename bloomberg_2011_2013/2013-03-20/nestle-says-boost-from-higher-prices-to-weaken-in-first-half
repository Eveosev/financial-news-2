Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s largest food
company, said the benefits it has derived from price increases
will start to diminish in the first half.  “The pricing action that was taken in the last 18 months
will start to dissipate,” Chief Financial Officer Wan Ling Martello said at a meeting with analysts in  London  available via
the company’s website. The Vevey, Switzerland-based company made
similar comments when it reported full-year results, she said.  Higher prices boosted Nestle’s sales by 2.8 percentage
points in 2012 and 3.6 percentage points in 2011. The Nespresso
capsule maker last month reported the slowest sales growth in
three years and said it expects 2013 to be as challenging as
last year. Even so, the company said it was confident of meeting
its target for organic sales growth of 5 percent to 6 percent.  “We will deliver the Nestle model in 2013,” Martello said
today, although “there will be some lumpiness, some volatility
when it comes to phasing” of sales growth.  Nestle faces more testing comparisons in the first quarter,
which a year ago had stronger pricing benefits and an additional
day due to a leap year, Martello said.  The  shares  pared gains and were up 0.3 percent at 68.35
Swiss francs at 11:10 a.m. after rising as much as 1 percent.  The company defines organic growth as sales growth
excluding acquisitions, disposals and currency shifts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
