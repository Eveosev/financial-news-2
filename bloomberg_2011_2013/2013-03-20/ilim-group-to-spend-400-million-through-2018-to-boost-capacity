OAO Ilim Group (ILIM) ,  Russia â€™s biggest
timber and pulp producer, plans to invest about $400 million on
road building and machinery through 2018 to increase capacity.  The investment also seeks to cut main production costs 20
percent from $33.5 a cubic meter (35 cubic feet) of raw forest
material, said Igor Sapunkov, director for forest strategy.  Ilim utilizes about 88 percent of its 10.5 million cubic
meters of annual forest resources, he told a Moscow timber
conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
