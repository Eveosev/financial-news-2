The  World Bank  and its private
sector arm, the  International Financing Corporation , are ready
to finance energy projects in the Balkans, home to some of
 Europe ’s few untapped renewable sources.  “The Balkans is one of a few regions in Europe with a
number of undeveloped sites” for making power from renewable
sources, while more developed parts of the continent are
“prepared to pay a rather high price for the supply,” Loup
Brefort, the World Bank’s representative in  Serbia , said at a
business forum in Belgrade today. Public-private partnerships
and joint ventures are probably the best way to develop such
projects, he said.  The Washington-based lender could finance the public part
of such partnerships, while the IFC could provide financing
needed for the private portion, Brefort said.  The investments would help the region deal with an economic
slump and create jobs amid high unemployment, he said. “The
governments in the region should welcome foreign investors with
open arms because it’s a win-win, for the countries and for the
investors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
