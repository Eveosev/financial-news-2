Schoeller-Bleckmann Oilfield
Equipment AG (SBO) , the Austrian maker of directional drilling gear
used to tap deepwater oil, fell in Vienna trading after orders
receded and a proposed dividend failed to meet expectations.  The stock dropped as much as 2.7 percent to 80.57 euros,
the  worst performer  on the 20-member Austrian Traded Index, and
traded at 80.75 euros at 12:16 p.m. The Ternitz-based company
proposed a 1.50 euro dividend, below the 1.70 euro payout
forecast in data compiled by Bloomberg.  The order intake “points to a decline of sales from
2013,” according to a note from Baader Bank analyst Christine
Reitsamer, who advised investors to sell the stock. Fourth-
quarter orders dropped 31 percent to 85 million euros ($110
million), she wrote.  Recently customers have sought to “optimize their capital
expenditures and inventories as they tend to invest more in
repairing tools than purchasing new equipment,” the company
said in a statement. While the trend to repair rather than
replace gear has continued into the first quarter,  oil prices 
over $100 a barrel “will further drive demand.”  Schoeller-Bleckmann has benefited from rising oil prices
that have pushed companies to extract crude from hard-to-reach
places. The company is expanding its Austrian manufacturing
capacity to meet demand for its drilling gear from deepwater
platform operators and shale-oil miners.  Schoeller-Bleckmann’s full-year 2012 net income rose 43
percent to 76.2 million euros after sales jumped 25 percent to
512 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
