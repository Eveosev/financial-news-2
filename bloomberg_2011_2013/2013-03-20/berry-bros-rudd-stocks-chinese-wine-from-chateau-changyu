Berry Bros. & Rudd, the 314-year-
old London wine merchant, has become the first major U.K.
retailer to stock Chinese wines in its permanent range,
according to a statement from the company.  Berry is offering four wines from Changyu, part of  Yantai
Changyu Pioneer Wine Co. (200869)  based in Shandong, northeast  China .
They include a red Chateau Changyu Moser blended from Cabernet
Sauvignon and Merlot grapes typical of  France ’s Bordeaux region
and three sweet ice wines made from frozen grapes.  Chinese appetite for imported Bordeaux and Burgundy has
helped sustain the global market over the past five years as the
economic downturn in the U.S. and the debt crisis in  Europe 
damped demand elsewhere. Now China is looking to export its own
wines.  “It was only a matter of time before it entered the
international wine market,” Mark Pardoe, Berry’s buying
director, said in the e-mailed statement. “This is a first step
towards serious international recognition.”  China is already the world’s eighth-largest producer of
wine, and the U.K. supermarket chain Waitrose Ltd. stocked
Chinese wine for a period last year, the Berry statement said.  To contact the reporter on the story:
