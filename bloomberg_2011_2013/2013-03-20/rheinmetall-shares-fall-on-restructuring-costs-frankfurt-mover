Rheinmetall AG (RHM)  fell the most in 17
months after the maker of armored military vehicles and
artillery systems announced unexpected restructuring charges
that will impair earnings this year.  Rheinmetall shares fell as much as 10 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since October 2011, and traded down 7.8 percent at
37.75 euros as of 1:46 p.m. in Frankfurt on volume five times
the three month daily average. The shares have risen 4 percent
this year, valuing the Dusseldorf, Germany-based company at 1.5
billion euros ($1.9 billion).  Rheinmetall plans restructuring measures cutting 2013
profit by 60 million euros to 80 million euros as it tries to
improve profitability and generate savings of 55 million euros
to 70 million euros from 2015, the company said in a statement
today. The restructuring plan, focused on the defense business,
will also aim to boost  cash flow  to allow for acquisitions,
Rheinmetall said.  “The additional restructuring costs are a big negative
surprise,” Markus Turnwald, a Frankfurt-based analyst at  DZ
Bank  with a buy recommendation on the shares, said in a note.
The company’s 2013 outlook “disappoints substantially.”  Sales this year should reach 4.8 billion euros to 4.9
billion euros, after rising 6 percent to 4.7 billion euros last
year, the company said.  “2013 will become a year of transition toward improved
profitability,” Chief Executive Officer Armin Papperger said in
the statement.  The company will continue to pursue more business abroad,
he said. Order intake from  Asia  and the  Middle East  grew to 27
percent of group total last year, from 14 percent the year
prior.  To contact the reporter on this story:
