Chevron Corp. (CVX)  plans to shut a
hydrotreater at its Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi in the
first week of April for six weeks of maintenance, according to a
person familiar with the work.  The refinery’s coker is still shut following about six
weeks of maintenance and may restart next week, said the person,
who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t
public. Recent turnaround work also took place on a crude
distillation unit and vacuum distillation unit, another person
familiar with the work said.  The Pascagoula  plant  has the capacity to process 330,000
barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It produces 39 percent gasoline, 23 percent diesel and 15
percent jet fuel, according to Chevron’s website.  A hydrotreater removes sulfur, metal and other impurities
from refined products.  Sean Comey , a  San Ramon , California-based spokesman for
Chevron, said the company doesn’t comment on routine maintenance
and will continue to supply customers with products without
interruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
