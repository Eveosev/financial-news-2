Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , rose the most this month after
saying it will pay less for a tax than earlier estimated.  The  shares strengthened  2.3 percent, the biggest increase
since Feb. 28, to 409 forint by the close in Budapest. The
benchmark BUX stock  index  rose 1.7 percent.  Magyar Telekom is paying 7.2 billion forint ($31 million)
for a utility tax this year, it said in a  statement  to the
Budapest Stock Exchange today. In November, the company said it
expected to pay 9 to 11 billion forint per year on the levy. The
lower-than-estimated cost means Magyar Telekom’s dividend, which
management proposed at 50 forint for the 2012 business year, may
not fall as much in future years as investors expected, said
Gergely Gabler, a Budapest-based analyst at broker Equilor
Befektetesi Zrt.  “The market doesn’t regard the 50 forint level as
sustainable but with the lower utility tax payment a 40 forint
dividend may now be more doable,” Gabler said in a phone
interview.  Magyar Telekom can pay a dividend as long as the company’s
net debt ratio is between 30 percent and 40 percent, financial
news website  investor.hu  reported today, citing Chief Executive
Officer Christopher Mattheisen. Magyar Telekom’s net debt ratio
was 34 percent last year, allowing the company to pay 50 forint
in dividends, Mattheisen said, without commenting further on
future payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
