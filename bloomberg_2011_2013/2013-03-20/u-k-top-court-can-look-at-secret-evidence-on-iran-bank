The U.K.  Supreme Court  can consider
secret evidence against an Iranian bank that wasn’t made public
in a case over government sanctions because of national-security
concerns.  The country’s highest court ruled it could review the
evidence against Bank Mellat in private if it needed to, though
it wasn’t convinced it was “necessary” to use that power, the
nine-judge panel said in a message sent to the parties in the
case after a hearing yesterday.  The British government in 2009 banned any company operating
in the U.K. from dealing with Tehran-based Bank Mellat as part
of rules designed to prevent the development of nuclear weapons
by  Iran . The bank claimed the restriction is illegal and took
the case to the Supreme Court, which will hear the matter today.  Bank Mellat’s lawyers argued yesterday that it wouldn’t be
fair for top court judges to see parts of a lower court ruling
that were issued in private. A litigant has “a fundamental
right to know the case against him and to answer it,” said
Michael Brindle, a lawyer for the lender.  The government wants to extend the use of closed trials to
include civil cases where evidence might compromise national
security. The Justice and Security Bill, currently being debated
by British lawmakers, has been criticized by lawyers and civil
rights groups who argue it will erode the right to a fair trial.  A call to the U.K. Treasury’s press office wasn’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
