Egyptian authorities arrested
prominent Salafi leader Gamal Saber in connection with clashes
between two families in a Cairo district that left three people
dead and dozens injured, officials said.  Saber, a leading campaigner for former Salafist
presidential candidate Hazem Abu-Ismail, was arrested last night
after accusations that his son stabbed to death a 15-year-old
boy during a football match in the street on March 18, Mohamed
Gohar, deputy sheriff of Road El-Farag police station, said by
phone.  The families of both boys had been exchanging gunfire and
Molotov cocktails for two days following the death of high
school student Saad Dorra and “police forces couldn’t contain
the situation,” Gohar said. Many shops and at least 70 cars
parked along the street were damaged in the fighting, state-run
Ahram Gate reported yesterday. Prosecutors ordered the arrest of
30 people including Ahmed Saber, Gamal’s son, Ahram reported.  Egypt has suffered from a general increase in violence in
the two years since the uprising against  Hosni Mubarak .  To contact the reporter on this story:
