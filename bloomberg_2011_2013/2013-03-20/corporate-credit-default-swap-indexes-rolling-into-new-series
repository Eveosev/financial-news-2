The latest series of indexes
measuring the cost of protecting against default on corporate
debt started trading today.  Gauges of credit-default swaps on companies in  Europe ,  Asia 
and  Australia  rolled into their 19th series. The 20th version of
the Markit CDX North America Investment-Grade Index also opens
today and the new Markit iTraxx Japan series starts tomorrow.
New benchmarks are created every six months when companies are
added or dropped depending on their ratings, cost of protection
and ease of trading.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-
default swaps linked to 50 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings cost 478 basis points at 9:30 a.m. in  London ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 428
basis points for Series 18 at the close yesterday.  The Markit iTraxx Europe index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was at 121 basis points, compared with
115 yesterday. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the
senior debt of 25 banks and insurers was at 170, after closing
at 162, and the subordinated index was 294 basis points, up from
293.  Four constituents changed in Europe’s investment-grade
benchmark and six in the high-yield measure. Constituents of the
financial gauges didn’t change.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($12.9 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
