Abengoa SA (ABG) , the Spanish company
that has developed desalination plants from  Algeria  to India,
said a new unit in China is a “model” to expand in the world’s
most populous nation.  Abengoa financed the $177 million Qingdao project entirely
through Chinese banks, Guillermo Bravo, a vice president at
Abengoa, said at the  Water Week Latin America  conference in Vina
Del Mar,  Chile , today. The project will generate $865 million in
revenue, he said.  “This is a model to follow going forward,” he said.  China is turning to desalination to boost supplies in its
arid northeast and has awarded contracts to Abengoa and Israel’s
IDE Technologies Ltd. to build plants. China plans to triple its
desalination capacity to 2.2 million cubic meters a day by 2015,
according to the Chinese National Development and Reform
Commission.  The Qingdao plant at the second-largest port in northern
 China  can produce 100,000 cubic meters of drinking water a day
from seawater, enough to supply the needs of half a million
people, according to Abengoa.  The company began building the plant in 2010 and will
operate and maintain it for 25 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
