Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) , the
renewable-energy unit of  Italy â€™s biggest utility, started
building a 120 million-euro ($155 million) plant in Tuscany that
will tap underground heat to produce electricity.  The 40-megawatt facility will use two turbines to generate
about 310 million kilowatt-hours of power a year, Rome-based
Enel said in a  statement  on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
