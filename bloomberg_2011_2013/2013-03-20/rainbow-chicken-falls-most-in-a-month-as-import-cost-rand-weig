Rainbow Chicken Ltd. (RBW)  fell the most
in a month after Remgro Ltd. Chief Executive Officer Jannie Durand said imports and a weakening rand will continue to weigh
on earnings at  South Africa ’s largest chicken producer.  The stock fell 2.4 percent to 16 rand by 3 p.m. in
Johannesburg, the biggest decline since Feb. 18 on a closing
basis. About 355,000 shares were traded, 1.8 times the three-
month daily average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Remgro has a 73.4 percent stake in Rainbow.  Yellow corn, used mainly as  animal feed , has risen 12
percent on the South African Futures Exchange this year, while
an increase in chicken imports has cut producers’ ability to
raise prices and recoup expenses. The rand has declined 8.7
percent against the dollar this year, the worst slide among
emerging-market currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
