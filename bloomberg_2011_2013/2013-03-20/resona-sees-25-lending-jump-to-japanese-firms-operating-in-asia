Resona Holdings Inc. (8308) ,  Japan ’s
fifth-largest bank by market value, plans to boost loans to
Japanese businesses expanding in  Asia  by 25 percent within a
year, its incoming president said.  Kazuhiro Higashi, who takes the post on April 1, is
targeting 50 billion yen ($521 million) in new loans to domestic
companies with operations in countries including China, Thailand
and  Indonesia  by March 31, 2014, he said in an interview. Such
loans total 40 billion yen so far this fiscal year.  “We’re seeing growing interest in Asia expansion among our
clients,” Deputy President Higashi, 55, said March 13. “We’ve
had more than 700 consultations on the subject over the last six
months -- that’s been quite a surprise.”  Resona, which depends entirely on domestic business,
follows bigger Japanese rivals including Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. in tapping credit demand from faster-
growing economies as deflation and a shrinking population  limit 
growth at home. The bank is now seeking a tie-up with a
Malaysian lender, similar to an alliance struck with Manila-
based  Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCB)  last year, he said.  With no banking licenses outside of Japan, Resona has
relied on partners such as  State Bank of India , the nation’s
largest lender by assets, to boost loans to domestic companies
with offshore operations.  Bailout Payback  The bank is among lenders that were rescued by taxpayers
after collapsing under bad loans in the wake of Japan’s property
and stock-market bubble in the 1990s. The government has
injected 3.1 trillion yen into Resona since 1999.  The Tokyo-based bank owes the government 872 billion yen,
including 610 billion yen of preferred shares and 262 billion
yen of common stock.  Following rival  Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. (8309) ’s
bailout repayment announcement earlier this month, Higashi said
there is no change to his bank’s payback  plan  announced in
November 2010. About 450 billion yen of preferred stock remains
to be bought back by March 2016 as part of that plan, he said.  Shares of Resona have surged 33 percent this year in Tokyo,
and rose 1.4 percent to 520 yen as of 9:42 a.m., the price at
which the government bought them. Japan’s benchmark Topix Index
has gained 23 percent this year.  “We don’t plan to take any action because of the rally in
the shares,” Higashi said, two days after Sumitomo Mitsui
Trust, bought back 200 billion yen of its own shares from the
government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
