Russia , which opposed a European
Union decision to tax Cypriot deposits, should contribute to
burden-sharing in solving the country’s banking crisis, BNP
Paribas SA Chairman  Baudouin Prot  said.  “It seems desirable that Russia participates in a global
solution,” Prot said at a conference in Paris today in comments
confirmed by his press office. “It seems reasonable to try
solutions so that it’s not uniquely European middle-class
taxpayers that are asked to pay for the consequences of the
Cypriot banking system crisis.”  BNP Paribas, France’s largest bank based in Paris, exited
the Cypriot banking system “years ago” and has “practically”
no exposure to the country, Prot said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
