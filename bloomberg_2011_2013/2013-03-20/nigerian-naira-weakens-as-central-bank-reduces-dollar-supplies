The naira depreciated to the lowest
in almost a week as the  Central Bank of Nigeria  offered fewer
dollars at an auction, offsetting its decision to hold the key
lending rate at a record high to support the currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer fell 0.2
percent to 158.95 per dollar by 4:19 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Abuja-based bank sold $280 million at a foreign-
currency auction today, less than the $300 million given out at
the previous sale on March 18, it said in an e-mailed statement.
The Monetary Policy Committee kept its benchmark  interest rate 
at a record high of 12 percent for a ninth consecutive meeting
yesterday to support the naira.  “Traders reacted to lower dollar supply by the central
bank amid rising demand,” Sewa Wusu, an analyst at Lagos-based
Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone. “The policy rate should
boost naira overtime as it checks liquidity of the local unit.”  In the next week, the naira should trade at about 158.7 per
dollar with monetary policy support, Kunle Ezun and Kenneth
Asenime, analysts at Ecobank Transnational Inc. in Lagos, wrote
in an e-mailed note to clients today.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 declined 34 basis points to 11.26 percent in the
secondary market, according to yesterday’s data compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the
$500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 declined 10 basis
points to 4.232 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened 0.1 percent to 1.9373 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
