BioLineRx Ltd. (BLRX)  tumbled the most on
record after an experimental treatment for schizophrenia failed
to help patients in a mid-stage clinical trial, prompting the
Israeli drugmaker to end development of the compound.  BioLine, based in  Jerusalem , plunged 51 percent to $1.87 at
12:01 p.m. in New York, the lowest price since July 2011, when
the shares were listed in the U.S. The Bloomberg Israel-US
Equity Index of the biggest Israeli companies in the U.S. rose
for the first time in four days, adding 0.8 percent.  The treatment, BL-1020, didn’t meet the trial’s main goal
of improving cognitive function compared with risperidone, a
generic drug, BioLine said in a statement. The American
depositary receipts had gained 51 percent this year through
yesterday. Shares in Tel Aviv dropped 52 percent to 6.82
shekels, or $1.86 today.  “For the stock price to be cut in half, in our view, seems
excessive,” Raghuram Selvaraju, an analyst at New York-based
Aegis Capital Corp., said in a phone interview. He cut his
share-price estimate today by 36 percent to $7 and kept a buy
rating on BioLine. “All the institutional investors I spoke
with thought it would fail.”  The biopharmaceutical company said in the statement that
research and development costs will drop this year and in part
of 2014 by about $6 million to $7 million.  Schizophrenia is a disabling brain disorder, affecting
about 1 percent of Americans, according to the National
Institute of Mental Health.  To contact the reporter on this story:
