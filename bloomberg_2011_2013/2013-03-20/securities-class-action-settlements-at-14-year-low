The number of securities class-
action settlements fell to a 14-year low in 2012 while their
average dollar value rose to an all-time high, a research study
found.  The 53 court-approved settlements reported last year
represent a more than 45 percent decline from the 10-year
average since 2002, and the average settlement increased to
$54.7 million in 2012 from $21.6 million in 2011,  Cornerstone
Research  concluded in a report released today.  “Based on the volume of recent securities class action
filings, the unusually low number of settlements reported in
2012 is unlikely to persist in the future,” said Laura E.
Simmons, senior adviser of Cornerstone. That’s based on higher
numbers of filings in recent years that may come to settlement
later, she said. For 2008 and 2009, there are 70 cases yet to be
resolved, she said.  “Settlement trends are often best viewed over time periods
longer than a year,”  Joseph Grundfest , a law professor and
director of the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action
Clearinghouse, said in the statement. “A lull in last year’s
data suggested a pickup for this year.”  The Cornerstone researchers said such cases historically
take years to settle, and the decrease in the number of
settlements last year may be traced to fewer lawsuits being
filed in 2009 and 2010. Since 2007, the median time for
settlement was 3.3 years, the researchers said.  ‘Significant Slowdown’  They also cited a “significant slowdown in the initial
public offering market in 2008 and 2009” as a possible cause
for a dip in some 2012 settlements.  Cornerstone found that a third of the settlements in 2012
were in the financial services industry, with the technology and
pharmaceutical industries being the next most prevalent sectors.  Institutional investors are being seen more as plaintiffs
in securities class-action lawsuits, the study determined. Since
2006, institutions and public pension funds have been settling
more lawsuits, with public pensions serving as lead plaintiffs
in 49 percent of settled cases, compared with 6 percent in 2003,
according to Cornerstone.  The organization, based in  Menlo Park ,  California , provides
economic and financial consulting and expert testimony, with
consultants across the country.  In one case cited by Simmons, Motorola Solutions Inc. last
May won final federal court approval of a $200 million
settlement with shareholders who sued the company and top
executives in 2007 for allegedly overstating its prospects
during the prior year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
