Nigeria’s central bank Governor
Lamido Sanusi said he won’t renew his contract when his five-
year term expires next year.  Sanusi, who has led the bank of  Africa ’s biggest oil
producer since June 2009, said it was never his intention to
stay longer than one term. He was speaking in an interview with
CNBC Africa in Abuja, the capital.  Appointed in the midst of a debt crisis that threatened the
collapse of the nation’s banking system, Sanusi, 51, fired the
chief executives of eight lenders within four months of taking
office. An audit of banks at the time found evidence of
mismanagement and reckless lending.  In 2011, he was named central bank governor of the year by
London-based The Banker magazine.  Nigerian  inflation  probably won’t accelerate too far above
10 percent this year, Sanusi told CNBC. The inflation rate rose
to 9.5 percent in February from 9 percent in the previous month.  “We don’t think we are going to see inflation above double
digits this year,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
