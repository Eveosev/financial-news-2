Veolia Environnement  SA,  Europe ’s
biggest water company, plans to cut about 10 percent of the
workforce at its water division in  France  to reduce costs.  The 1,500 job cuts will be on a voluntary basis and
negotiated with unions, said a company official who declined to
be named because the process hasn’t been finalized. The plan was
discussed with unions yesterday.  Veolia plans to unveil new cost-saving targets in May and
has started cutting jobs in France through voluntary departures
and not replacing employees who leave, Chief Operating Officer
Francois Bertreau said last month. He was charged with cutting
costs and reorganizing operations in November when he was
appointed.  Veolia Chief Executive Officer Antoine Frerot, more than a
year into a two-year plan to curtail debt and scale back
Veolia’s geographic reach, has changed top managers and shuffled
the board to weather an industry slowdown.  Veolia reported net income of 394 million euros ($510
million) in 2012, compared with a loss of 490 million euros a
year earlier. Net financial debt totaled 11.3 billion euros at
the end of December, down from 14.7 billion euros a year
earlier. Veolia sees net borrowing at no more than 9 billion
euros by year-end.  Veolia will sell small and mid-sized assets in 2013, Chief
Financial Officer Pierre-Francois Riolacci has said. It sold 3.7
billion euros of assets in 2012 and expects that figure to
expand to 6 billion euros with this year’s divestments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
