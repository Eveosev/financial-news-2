The  Nigerian Stock Exchange  plans
to list five exchange-traded funds this year to increase
products available to investors, Chief Executive Officer Oscar Onyema said.  The bourse will also carry out research to prioritize the
start of futures and options trading next year, with a goal of
deepening the market, he said at a conference in Lagos, the
commercial capital today.  The Lagos-based exchange will start a corporate governance
index this year, which will “capture top companies” and
encourage others to list, Onyema said. Regulations for listing
on the Alternative Securities Market will also be reviewed this
year to get more small and medium companies to list, he said.  The bourse is sub-Saharan Africa’s second-biggest after
 South Africa ’s. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange (NGSEINDX)  All-Share Index has
risen 18 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
