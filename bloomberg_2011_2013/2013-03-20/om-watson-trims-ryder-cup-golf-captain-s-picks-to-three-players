U.S. Ryder Cup captain  Tom Watson 
will select three wild-card players for his 2014 team, one less
than in the past two editions.  Watson, an eight-time major tournament champion, is
changing the selection process to encourage players to earn
their way onto the team for the biennial matches in  Scotland .  “Giving our players one more opportunity to earn a spot on
merit, I believe, is the right thing to do,” Watson said in a
statement released by the PGA of America. “I will use all
possible resources in choosing these three captain’s choices to
complete the best possible team in order to win the Cup back for
the  United States .”  Watson, 63, will make his choices in September 2014, prior
to the 40th Ryder Cup at Gleneagles in Perthshire, Scotland.  The top nine U.S. players will automatically earn spots on
the team through a points system based on prize money. Players
will begin accumulating points on April 14, following the
 Masters Tournament , the first of golf’s four annual majors.  Watson, who also served as captain in 1993, is seeking to
lead a U.S. rebound from last year’s final-day collapse.  Europe 
equaled a 13-year-old record by the Americans for the biggest
comeback in the competition’s history, rallying from a 10-6
deficit beginning the last session to win the three-day matches
at Medinah Country Club outside Chicago 14 1/2 to 13 1/2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
