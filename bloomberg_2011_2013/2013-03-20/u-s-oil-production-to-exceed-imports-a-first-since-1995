U.S. crude oil production in the
fourth quarter will exceed imports for the first time since
1995, as booming fields in North Dakota and  Texas  put the nation
on track to surpass a quarter-century output record.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration, the research
arm of the Energy Department, said domestic crude production
will be 2 million barrels a day higher than imports at the end
of 2014, as oil from outside the U.S. is forecast to drop late
in that year.  “This projected change is primarily because of rising
domestic crude oil production, particularly from shale and other
tight rock formations in North Dakota and Texas,” the agency
said in a “ Today in Energy ” note posted on its website.  In global markets today, West Texas Intermediate oil rose
after its steepest plunge in a month. Brent futures rebounded
from their lowest level since December. U.S. crude stockpiles
fell 413,000 barrels last week, the American Petroleum Institute
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
