Defending national champion the
 University of Kentucky  was eliminated by Robert Morris
University 59-57 in the opening round of men’s college
basketball’s National Invitation Tournament.  Mike McFadden hit two free throws with 8.7 seconds left in
last night’s game to give eighth-seeded Robert Morris (24-10)
the upset victory against top-seeded  Kentucky  (21-12) at the
Charles L. Sewall Center in Coraopolis,  Pennsylvania .  Robert Morris missed the National Collegiate Athletic
Association tournament after losing to Mount St. Mary’s in the
Northeastern Conference tournament. Kentucky was not chosen for
the 68-team NCAA tournament, which it won last year.  “It’s probably the greatest consolation prize you can
possibly have,” Robert Morris coach Andy Toole told reporters.  Lucky Jones scored 15 points and Russell Johnson had 14 for
the Colonials. Archie Goodwin scored 18 points and Jarrod Polson
had 10 points for the Wildcats, who lost six of their final 10
games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
