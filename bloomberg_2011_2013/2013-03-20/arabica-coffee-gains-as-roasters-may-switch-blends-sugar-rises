Arabica coffee climbed for the
first time in eight trading sessions in New York on speculation
roasters may add more of the beans favored by  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  to
blends. Sugar and cocoa in the city also rose.  Arabica futures touched $1.3255 a pound yesterday, the
lowest since June 2010. The commodity lost 37 percent last year,
making it the worst performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
gauge of 24 raw materials. Robusta beans, used in instant
coffee, climbed 12 percent this year after advancing 6.3 percent
in 2012. The premium arabica commands over robusta slid to 35.4
cents a pound yesterday, the lowest since December 2008. That
may attract roasters to arabica beans.  “It has been a steady grind lower for New York the last
couple of weeks,”  Keith Flury an analyst at Rabobank
International in  London , said by e-mail today. “The early
bounce today may rest on concerns the selloff may be overdone.
We are at that $1.33 a pound level we were at before the 2010
rally. That level has offered support in the past and also
now.”  Arabica coffee for delivery in May rose 0.6 percent to
$1.3385 a pound by 8:17 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Robusta coffee for delivery in May fell 0.3 percent to $2,148 a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  Arabica’s premium over robusta will need to stay at 35
cents to 40 cents for one or two quarters before roasters make
significant changes to blends, said  Rodrigo Costa , director of
trading at Caturra Coffee Corp. in Elmsford, New York.  Robusta Beans  Robusta futures fell for a third day as rain is forecast in
 Vietnam , the world’s largest producer of the variety. Showers
and thunderstorms will be scattered across the country today,
according to weather forecaster AccuWeather.  Raw sugar for May delivery gained 0.8 percent to 18.46
cents a pound on ICE. White sugar for May delivery was up 0.4
percent to $532 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Above-average rainfall in the second quarter is set to
disrupt harvesting of the sugar cane crop in  Brazil ’s center
south, the country’s main growing region, according to Somar
Meteorologia. Rain may be about 30 percent above the historical
average from April to June, according to Celso Oliveira, a
meteorologist at the Sao Paulo-based weather forecaster.  Cocoa for May delivery advanced 1.5 percent to $2,130 a ton
in  New York . Cocoa for May delivery rose 1.1 percent to 1,433
