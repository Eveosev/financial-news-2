The Philippine peso fell to a two-
week low and government bonds advanced after foreign investors
pulled money from local stocks as the benchmark share gauge
extended its retreat from a record.  Funds based overseas sold $47 million more local stocks
than they bought in the first two days of this week, exchange
data show. The Philippine Stock Exchange Composite  Index (PCOMP)  has
lost 6.1 percent since reaching its highest close on March 6.
The dollar gained against most major currencies today as
investors favored the safest of assets after the Cypriot
parliament voted down a bank-deposit levy needed to secure a
bailout, risking renewed tumult in  Europe .  “There are stock-market outflows and the dollar is a bit
strong against other currencies because of the Europe concern,”
said  Jonathan Ravelas , chief market strategist at  BDO Unibank
Inc. (BDO)  in  Manila . “The stock market is overvalued.”  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 40.737 per dollar in
Manila, according to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
40.763 earlier, the lowest level since March 7. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, increased 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 3.82 percent.  The yield on the 6.125 percent government bonds due October
2037 dropped six basis points to 4.13 percent, according to noon
fixing prices from the Philippine Dealing & Exchange Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
