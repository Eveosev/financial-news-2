Arabtec (ARTC)  Holding Co. will use most
of the proceeds from a rights offer and bond sale to bolster its
oil and gas installation business.  Arabtec, the  United Arab Emirates ’ biggest construction
company, last month announced a plan to raise 6.4 billion
dirhams ($1.74 billion). The company will expand its Target
Engineering unit “through geographic growth and some
acquisitions,” giving it a better chance of winning contracts
worth $7 billion, according to a statement today.  The company, which helped build the world’s tallest tower
in Dubai, is also expanding its affordable housing, power and
infrastructure units after Abu Dhabi-based Aabar Investments
increased its direct stake to 21.6 percent. Arabtec plans to
raise $650 million in a rights offer this year and, if
necessary, will carry out a share sale of a similar size next
year, the company said.  Arabtec scrapped a plan to sell convertible bonds and may
instead issue $450 million of bonds this year or next if funding
is needed, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
