Airvana Network Solutions Inc.  was
granted a preliminary injunction in its intellectual-property
lawsuit against Ericsson AB, the world’s largest maker of
wireless networks.  Airvana, a Chelmsford, Massachusetts-based provider of
network-infrastructure software, sued Ericsson in February 2012
for more than $330 million, accusing the Stockholm-based company
of developing software based on Airvana trade secrets and using
it to operate wireless  network equipment  to avoid paying license
fees.  New York State Supreme Court Justice Barbara Kapnick, in an
order dated yesterday, granted Airvana’s request for an
injunction blocking Ericsson from “using, operating, testing or
deploying” certain hardware unless it’s using software licensed
from Airvana.  “Airvana has met its burden of showing that it will suffer
irreparable harm absent the requested injunctive relief,”
Kapnick wrote.  Kathy Egan, a spokeswoman for Ericsson in the U.S., didn’t
immediately respond to a voice-mail message seeking comment on
the ruling.  The case is Airvana Network Solutions Inc. v. Ericsson
Inc., 650360-2012,  New York  State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
