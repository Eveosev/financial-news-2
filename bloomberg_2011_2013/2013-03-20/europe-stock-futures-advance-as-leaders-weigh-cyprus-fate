European stocks climbed, snapping a
three-day loss for the benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index, as the
region’s policy makers weighed options for keeping Cyprus in the
euro area.  Deutsche Bank AG and BNP Paribas SA paced a rebound in
banks, both rising at least 1 percent. U.K. homebuilders rallied
as Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced a new
program to support British housing. Rheinmetall AG lost 6.9
percent after forecasting lower earnings in 2013.  The Stoxx 600 advanced 0.3 percent to 296.5 at the close of
trading, after falling 1 percent in the past three days. The
gauge retreated yesterday before Cypriot lawmakers voted on the
5.8 billion-euro ($7.5 billion) bank-deposit levy which was
rejected after the close of trade.  Cyprus is “not a really major economic issue,” Laurence D. Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc., told  Susan
Li  on Bloomberg Television in Hong Kong. “It’s a $10 billion
issue. To me, this is just temporary. I think Cyprus was just
one of the elements that people are saying ‘let me pause here’.
We are going through a digestive stage right now.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in 15 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slipped 0.1 percent,
Germany’s DAX climbed 0.7 percent and  France ’s CAC 40 jumped 1.4
percent.  New Package  Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden called for the 17
euro-area finance ministers to reconvene quickly to put together
a new package for Cyprus, after the rejection of the levy threw
an earlier bailout plan into limbo.  The  European (SXXP)  Central Bank, whose Governing Council meets
today in  Frankfurt , is likely to delay the decision on supplying
emergency funds to Cypriot banks, two people familiar with the
matter said.  Policy makers don’t need to vote on whether to extend or
halt Emergency Liquidity Assistance to Cypriot banks at their
two-day meeting that ends tomorrow, the people said.  Kathimerini reported that a preliminary deal has been
reached to sell Cyprus Popular Bank to Russian investors, paving
the way for a reduction of 4 billion euros in the country’s
financing needs. Spokesman Christos Stylianides told Bloomberg
News that no deal had been reached.  Deutsche Bank paced a rebound in euro-area lenders, gaining
1.4 percent to 32.44 euros. The shares snapped a three-day
decline even as  Germany ’s largest bank said it raised its
litigation reserves 33 percent to 2.4 billion euros.  BNP Paribas SA rose 3.1 percent to 42.24 euros and Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA added 2.4 percent to 7.40 euros. A
 gauge  of the euro-area’s largest banks rallied 2.3 percent after
falling 6.8 percent over the previous three sessions.  British Housing  In the U.K., George Osborne told Parliament in his annual
budget that the forecast for economic growth this year was cut
by half to 0.6 percent as he lowered corporation tax and set out
an updated central-bank remit to aid Britain’s recovery.  The Chancellor also announced a new Help-to-Buy program to
support the housing industry. He committed 3.5 billion pounds
($5.3 billion) to help first-time buyers purchase newly built
houses and offered guarantees sufficient to support 130 billion
pounds of mortgages.  Taylor Wimpey Plc  paced a rally in homebuilders, climbing
6.1 percent to 90.85 pence, its highest price since May 2008.
Persimmon Plc rallied 4 percent to 1,010 pence, the highest
since November 2007. Barratt Developments Plc jumped 6.6 percent
to 255.6 pence, the highest price since April 2008.  Vivendi, Mediaset  Vivendi SA jumped 4.4 percent to 16.22 euros, the biggest
gain in four months, after people familiar with the matter said
it’s considering spinning off telecommunications provider SFR,
its biggest unit.  Mediaset (MS)  SpA gained 5.5 percent to 1.65 euros after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. raised its recommendation for the shares to
neutral from sell, citing their recent drop. The stock has
tumbled 19 percent since Jan. 18.  Elementis Plc (ELM)  climbed 3.8 percent to 275 pence, its highest
price since at least 1988, after JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded
the chemical company to overweight, equivalent to a buy rating.
The brokerage also raised its  price estimate  by 50 percent to
300 pence.  Dufry AG advanced 3.3 percent to 120.50 Swiss francs as UBS
AG raised its recommendation for the operator of duty-free shops
to buy from neutral. The bank increased its price target to 138
francs.  Royal  Imtech (IM)  NV climbed 2.6 percent to 10.01 euros after
saying that its financial restructuring is on track as its
lenders agreed to continue the current financing arrangements.
The Dutch provider of 2012 London Olympics stadium
infrastructure also said the remaining 200 million euros of a
bridging loan will become available to company.  Rheinmetall Outlook  Rheinmetall tumbled 6.9 percent to 38.14 euros after the
engineering group forecast earnings before interest and taxes
will fall to as low as 240 million euros, missing the average
analyst estimate of 295 million euros. The company cited
restructuring related costs.  ThyssenKrupp AG lost 2.2 percent to 16.99 euros after Dow
Jones reported that offers for the company’s steel plants in
Brazil and  Alabama  came in below its expectations. The sale
could cause further writedown of about $1.3 billion because the
bids are below the current book value of $5 billion, Dow Jones
said, citing two people familiar with the transaction.  Metro AG dropped 2.4 percent to 22.38 euros. Germany’s
biggest retailer forecast a decline in operating income in the
first nine months of 2013, citing investment in its Cash & Carry
