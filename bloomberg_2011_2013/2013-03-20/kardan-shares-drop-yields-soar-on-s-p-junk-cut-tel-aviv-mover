Kardan NV (KRNV) ’s shares dropped the most
on record and bond yields soared as Standard & Poor’s Maalot cut
the company to junk and new regulations in  Romania  derailed
plans for a shopping mall.  The  shares  tumbled 24 percent, the most since they were
listed in 2003, to 2.812 shekels at the close in Tel Aviv. The
yield on Kardan’s 1.19 billion shekels ($324 million) of 4.45
percent bonds maturing February 2016 soared 515 basis points, or
5.15 percentage points, to 27.39 percent. The TA-25 benchmark
stock index was little changed.  S&P reduced its credit rating for Kardan by two levels to
ilBB, two steps below investment grade, on a delay in selling
assets “critical” for the company to fulfill its “significant
debt repayments” in the first quarter of 2014. Separately,
Kardan said a change in the Romanian law won’t permit  Globe
Trade Centre SA (GTC) , in which it owns a 28 percent stake, to develop
a land plot in Bucharest.  “The S&P rating cut and the GTC Romanian announcement are
pushing the shares lower today,” Noam Pincu, a Tel Aviv-based
analyst at Psagot Investment House Ltd., said today by phone.
“We are hoping the company will be able to sell its asset in
China to give the company the tens of million of euros it needs
to pay its 2014 debt.”  Kardan has debt maturities of about 176 million euros ($228
million) to the end of 2014, S&P said today. The company had
cash and liquid financial assets of about 64 million euros at
the end of December, the ratings company said.  Negotiations between Kardan Land  China  and an unidentified
international fund to sell a 50 percent stake in the mixed-use
project Europark Dalian ended, the company said on March 17.
Kardan Land China is resuming discussions for the sale of the
project with other funds and investors, it said March 17.  “Kardan’s liquidity profile, which we had already assessed
as ‘weak’ according to our criteria, has been weakened further
after the breakdown in negotiations over Europark Dalian,” S&P
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
