Urbi Desarrollos Urbanos (URBI*) ,  Mexico ’s
third-biggest publicly-traded homebuilder by sales, gained for
the first time in nine sessions, snapping a losing streak during
which the shares fell 41 percent.  Urbi surged 6.4 percent to 3 pesos at the close of trading
in Mexico City, rising from a record low of 2.82 reached
yesterday. As recently as last year, the stock had traded as
high as 20.89 pesos. Mexico’s benchmark IPC index rose 1 percent
today  Shares of the country’s homebuilders have plunged this year
amid disappointing earnings results, negative cash flow figures
and changes in government housing policy to promote more
capital-intensive apartment construction.  “Investors are thinking that the sell-off has been
exaggerated,” said Carlos Hermosillo, an analyst with Grupo
Financiero Banorte SAB in a telephone interview. “I would be
wary of being positive just yet.”  Corp. Geo SAB (GEOB) , the country’s second-biggest homebuilder,
rose 0.7 percent to 6.88 pesos, also the first gain since March
6.  Desarrolladora Homex SAB (HOMEX*) , the biggest homebuilder, fell 5.9
percent to 19.67 pesos, extending its plunge to nine days.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. this week cut its rating on
Culiacan-based Homex to sell from the equivalent of hold and
lowered its price targets for Mexicali-based Urbi and Mexico
City-based Geo. Credit Suisse Group AG maintained its
recommendation of the three companies at the equivalent of sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
