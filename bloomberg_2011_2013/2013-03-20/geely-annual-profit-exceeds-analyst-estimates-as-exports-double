Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. (175) , the
publicly traded unit of  China ’s biggest independent automaker,
reported annual profit beat analyst estimates after exports
doubled.  Net income  climbed 32 percent to 2.04 billion  yuan  ($328
million), or 0.26 yuan a share, the company said in a statement
to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange today. That exceeded the 1.86
billion average of 23 analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Geely, which seeks at least half of its sales coming from
overseas by 2015, more than doubled its  exports  last year,
compared with a decline in local deliveries. Chinese automakers
have lost market share on continued concerns over quality and as
foreign automakers introduce lower-priced models.  The  automaker , a unit of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.,
rose as much as 4.3 percent. It gained 3.8 percent to HK$3.85 as
of 2:08 p.m. in Hong Kong trading, headed for the biggest gain
since Feb. 28. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  rose 0.6 percent.  Revenue rose 17 percent to 24.6 billion yuan. That exceeded
the 24.4 billion yuan average of 30 analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Geely is projecting vehicle sales to rise 16
percent to 560,000 units this year, it said in January.  Geely’s parent company, which owns Volvo Cars, said last
month it will invest 100 million pounds ($151 million) in London
black cab maker Manganese Bronze Holdings Plc in the next five
years to help turn the company profitable. Geely wants to have
Manganese Bronze export its black cabs to other countries,
spokesman Victor Yang said last month.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
