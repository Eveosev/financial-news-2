The world’s growing food demand
will create a “progressive scarcity” in existing water
supplies, according to the United Nations  Food and Agriculture
Organization .  Water used in farming will rise 70 to 90 percent through
2050 as food demand doubles over the same period in emerging
countries, Pasquale Steduto, principal officer of the FAO’s
water development and management unit, said today at an event in
Vina Del Mar,  Chile .  Global food demand will increase 60 percent through 2050,
Steduto said at the  Water Week Latin America  conference. That
will strain the world’s water supply as 1 liter of water is
required to provide every kilo-calorie of food, he said.  “This situation will bring us to a progressive scarcity,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
