The yield premium investors demand
to hold  Indonesia ’s 10-year bonds over two-year notes reached a
nine-month high on concern the government may reduce fuel
subsidies, which would quicken inflation. The rupiah fell.  Managing the use of subsidized fuel is a priority and
limits may be imposed on sales to privately owned vehicles,
Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said March 14. The government
has no plan to raise fuel prices in April, Julian Aldrin Pasha,
a spokesman for President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, said
yesterday.  Consumer prices  rose 5.31 percent in February from a
year earlier, the most since June 2011, official data show.  The gap between yields on the two- and 10-year bonds
widened to 118 basis points as of 3:24 p.m. in Jakarta, compared
with 115 yesterday, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show. That was the most since June 19, 2012. The
yield on the government’s 11 percent notes due October 2014 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.29 percent,
while the rate on debt due May 2023 was steady at 5.47 percent.  “Whether or not the government will adjust the subsidies
is uncertain, which has turned investors cautious,” said I Made Adi Saputra, a fixed-income analyst at PT Nusantara Capital
Securities in Jakarta. “The shorter-term notes will be
preferred to guard against inflation. Yields on longer-term
bonds may keep rising from here.”  The rupiah weakened 0.3 percent to 9,734 per dollar, prices
from local banks show. It traded at a 0.4 percent premium to the
one-month non-deliverable forwards, which fell 0.2 percent to
9,772, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,733 per dollar today by the Association of Banks in  Singapore ,
compared with 9,705 yesterday.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
declined 12 basis points to 5.86 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
