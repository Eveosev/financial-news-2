JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  will add
premium seats on some transcontinental jets, leaving  Southwest
Airlines Co. (LUV)  as the lone airline among the seven biggest U.S.
carriers with coach-only service.  JetBlue will offer the premium seats and Wi-Fi Internet
service on daytime flights between New York’s John F. Kennedy
airport and Los Angeles and San Francisco starting next year,
Chief Commercial Officer Robin Hayes said today at an investor
event in New York.  He didn’t elaborate on how many seats or whether the
company plans a separate first-class cabin. The carrier will
share more details later this year, he said.  The move will boost revenue and help JetBlue compete with
 United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ,  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  and AMR
Corp.’s American Airlines. All three have first-class cabins and
compete for passengers in JetBlue’s hometown of New York, the
nation’s busiest aviation market.  JetBlue needs premium seats “to be truly competitive” on
transcontinental service, Hayes said.  The top route from New York’s John F. Kennedy Airport is
Los Angeles, followed by San Francisco, according to the Bureau
of Transportation Statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
