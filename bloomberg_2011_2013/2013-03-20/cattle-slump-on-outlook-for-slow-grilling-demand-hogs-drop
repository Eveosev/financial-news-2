Cattle futures extended a decline
on speculation that persistent cold weather in the U.S. will
keep consumers from grilling outdoors, signaling lower meat
demand. Hog prices also fell.  Cold weather is expected to persist through the rest of
March across large Midwest and East Coast cities. From March 20
to 29, temperatures in the central U.S. may be 8 to 14 degrees
Fahrenheit below normal, according to MDA Weather Services. When
temperatures warm up, more people grill outdoors, boosting meat
demand, said  Christian Mayer , a market adviser at Northstar
Commodity Investments Co. in  Minneapolis .  “Domestic demand was probably hurting already,” Mayer
said in a telephone interview. “The cold weather’s not helping
at all.”  Cattle futures for June delivery dropped 0.2 percent to
$1.2075 a pound at 9:52 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Yesterday, the commodity touched $1.201, the lowest for the
most-active contract since July 18. Prices fell as low as $1.202
earlier today.  Wholesale  beef  retreated 0.8 percent yesterday to $1.9418 a
pound, the biggest decline since Feb. 15, U.S. Department of
Agriculture data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement slid 1.1 percent
to $1.38825 a pound in Chicago.  Hog futures for June settlement fell 1.1 percent to 87.275
cents a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
