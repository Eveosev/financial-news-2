Stocks in Switzerland  advanced for a
fourth day, with the benchmark index reaching a three-week high,
as health-care and luxury-goods shares rose.  Novartis AG (NOVN)  and  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  climbed, contributing the
most to the benchmark gauge’s gain. Cie. Financiere Richemont
SA, the owner of the Cartier brand, advanced 1.6 percent.  Meyer
Burger Technology AG (MBTN)  fell after reporting a first-half loss in a
preliminary report.  Cytos Biotechnology AG (CYTN)  plunged 7.6 percent
as the developer of an experimental drug for allergic asthma
posted a wider loss in the second quarter.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  gained 0.3 percent to 8,001.32 at
9:41 a.m. in Zurich. The equity benchmark climbed 2.1 percent
last week as the European Central Bank said interest rates will
remain low for an extended period of time. The broader Swiss
Performance Index added 0.2 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the SMI was about equal to the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the U.S., Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President
Richard Fisher yesterday said investors should not expect the
central bank to come to their rescue every time asset prices
fall.  “Financial markets may have become too accustomed to what
some have depicted as a Fed Put,” Fisher said in a speech in
 Portland , Oregon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
