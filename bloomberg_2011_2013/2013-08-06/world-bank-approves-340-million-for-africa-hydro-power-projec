The World Bank said its board
approved $340 million of financing for a hydroelectric project
intended to provide electricity to 62 million people in  Rwanda ,
Tanzania and Burundi.  The Regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric Project has a total
cost of $468.6 million and will eventually have generation
capacity of 80 megawatts, according to a statement released
today by the Washington-based bank. Each country is getting
$113.3 million from the bank’s International Development
Association unit, which offers zero-interest loans and grants to
the poorest countries, it said.  The so-called run-of-the-river project aims to spur
economic development and hiring, bolster regional cooperation
and minimize the environmental impact, according to the
statement. Four percent of Burundi’s population has access to
electricity. The rate is 13 percent in Rwanda and 15 percent in
Tanzania, according to the lender.  The African Great Lakes region where the project is located
has high levels of poverty and low levels of key services, the
bank said. Burundi  ranked  161st out of 190 in terms of gross
domestic product in 2012, according to World Bank data. Rwanda
was 141st and Tanzania 93rd.  In May, the World Bank pledged $1 billion in funding for
the region to help increase trade, expand road networks and
boost electricity generation, with projects including the Rusomo
Falls project and $100 million to boost agriculture. This is the
first operation in the initiative, according to today’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
