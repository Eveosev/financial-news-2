Newcastle United  signed striker Loic Remy on a season-long loan from Queens Park Rangers, the Premier
League soccer club said on its  website .  Remy scored six goals in 14 games after moving to QPR from
Marseille in January. The 26-year-old Frenchman almost joined
Newcastle at the time before signing with the  London  team.  “I was very flattered by the club’s interest in me back in
January and also very happy that they showed interest in me
again this summer,” he said.  Remy said he’s making the move to help his international
career following QPR’s relegation to the second-tier
Championship.  “The Premier League is the best league in the world and
that’s where I want to play,” he said. “I am very motivated
this year to get into the World Cup squad for my country. I know
in order to do that I need to have a big season and a successful
campaign with Newcastle United.”  Remy has four goals in 18 appearances for the French
national team.  Newcastle opens its Premier League season at  Manchester
City  on Aug. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
