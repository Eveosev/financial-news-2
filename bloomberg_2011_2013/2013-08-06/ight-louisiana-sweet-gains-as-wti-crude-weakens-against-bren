Light Louisiana Sweet strengthened
against West Texas Intermediate as the U.S. benchmark lost
ground to Brent, while other oils produced on the  Gulf Coast 
were mixed.  WTIâ€™s discount to its European counterpart widened by 74
cents to $2.88 a barrel, based on settlement prices, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. When the U.S. grade loses to
Brent, it can raise the value of domestic oils that compete for
space in Gulf Coast refineries with foreign crudes priced
against the international benchmark.  LLS gained 20 cents a barrel against WTI to a premium of
$5.25 at 2:05 p.m. in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost 15 cents a barrel to a premium
of $4.80. The premium for  Thunder Horse  was unchanged at $2.90 a
barrel, while Mars Blend gained 30 cents to 40 cents a barrel
over WTI and Poseidon rose 35 cents to a premium of 30 cents.  Bakken crude from  North Dakota  fell 15 cents to a discount
of $4 a barrel to WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
