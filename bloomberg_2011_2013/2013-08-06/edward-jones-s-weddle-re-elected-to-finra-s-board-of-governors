Edward Jones ’s James Weddle and
Robert Keenan of St. Bernard Financial Services Inc. were
elected to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s Board
of Governors at its annual meeting.  Weddle, a managing partner at St. Louis-based Edward Jones,
will serve a second term as one of Finra’s three large-firm
governors, the industry-funded regulatory group said today in a
statement.  Keenan, chief executive officer of St. Bernard, a broker-dealer in Russellville, Arkansas, will fill one of the three
small-firm governor slots.  Shelly Lazarus, former chairman and CEO of advertising firm
Oglivy & Mather, was appointed as a public governor. Lazarus
replaces Shirley Jackson, president of  Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute , who held the position since 2007.  Vanguard Group Inc.’s  John Brennan  was re-appointed as an
investment company affiliate. Public governor re-appointments
include William Heyman of Travelers Cos., John Schmidlin,
formerly of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and  Gary Stern , ex-Federal
Reserve Bank of Minneapolis president.  Governors are selected for three-year terms and can’t serve
more than two in a row. The 22-member board includes Finra’s
CEO, 11 public governors and 10 industry governors representing
large, medium and small firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
