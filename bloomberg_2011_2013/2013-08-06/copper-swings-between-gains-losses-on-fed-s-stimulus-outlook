Copper swung between gains and losses
as investors weighed declining stockpiles against speculation
the Federal Reserve will soon be able to taper stimulus. Zinc
fell for the first time in five days while lead rose for a fifth
session.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $6,970.25 a metric ton at 11:15
a.m. in  Tokyo  after trading between a 0.2 percent advance and a
0.2 percent drop. Futures for delivery in September on the Comex
lost 0.4 percent to $3.1570 a pound.  The Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing
index for the U.S. rose to 56 in July, above the median estimate
of 53.1 and June’s 52.2 reading. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President Richard Fisher said the central bank is closer to
slowing bond purchases that have stoked global equity gains.
Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the LME fell for a 14th session.  “Everyone is speculating when Fed may reduce stimulus and
that’s the key driver for all markets,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
senior trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in  Seoul . A
decline in stockpiles on the LME and  China ’s bonded warehouses
would limit a further decline in prices, he said.  LME copper inventories fell 0.3 percent to 606,900 tons,
data from the bourse showed yesterday. Orders to remove the
metal from warehouses rose 2.3 percent, the most since June 27,
to 324,300 tons.  Stockpiles in China’s bonded warehouses fell 63 percent to
300,000 tons in the four months through July, reducing total
stockpiles in the world’s biggest user to three weeks of
consumption, Judy Zhu, an analyst at Standard Chartered Plc,
said in a report on Aug. 2. The bank estimated total copper
inventories in China at about 500,000 tons, compared with a peak
of more than 1 million tons in March, she said.  Copper for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 50,110  yuan  ($8,183) a ton.  On the LME, zinc sank 0.3 percent to $1,864.50 a ton after
stockpiles monitored by the LME jumped 1.6 percent to 1.06
million tons yesterday, while lead gained 0.1 percent to $2,125
a ton. Aluminum and nickel were little changed, while tin slid
for the first time in five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
