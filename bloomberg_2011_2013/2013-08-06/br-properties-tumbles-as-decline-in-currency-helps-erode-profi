Brazilian real estate developer  BR
Properties SA (BRPR3)  fell the most in five weeks after profit trailed
estimates for the first time in 11 quarters, dragged down by a
weaker real.  The shares dropped 3.3 percent to 18.46 reais at 2:35 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, the biggest decline on a closing basis since July
2. The  Ibovespa (IBOV)  equity benchmark slid 1.7 percent.  Adjusted net income decreased 85 percent to 49.2 million
reais ($21.5 million) in the second quarter from a year earlier,
according to a regulatory filing yesterday after the market
closed. That compares with an average  estimate  of 66.4 million
reais among four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The financial
loss was 176 million reais, worse than expected, analysts at
Banco Bradesco SA’s brokerage unit led by Edigimar Maximiliano
wrote today in a research note to clients.  Part of that amount “refers to losses on the Brazilian
currency depreciation’s impact on the company’s dollar-denominated indebtedness,” and part is related to financial
derivatives, the analysts wrote.  Sao Paulo-based BR Properties has fallen 28 percent this
year, while the Ibovespa has declined 22 percent. The real lost
8.1 percent in the first half of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
