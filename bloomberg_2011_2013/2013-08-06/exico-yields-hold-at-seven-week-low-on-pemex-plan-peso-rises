Mexico ’s peso bond yields held at a
seven-week low on speculation President Enrique Pena Nieto’s
plan to open the country’s energy sector to more private
investment will spur demand for the nation’s securities.  Yields on debt maturing in 2014 were unchanged at 4.07
percent at 10:28 a.m. in Mexico City, matching the lowest level
on a closing basis since June 14, which was touched yesterday.
The peso climbed less than 0.1 percent to 12.6419 per dollar.  Pena Nieto will seek to amend articles of the constitution
to break the monopoly of  Petroleos Mexicanos , known as Pemex, in
the state-run oil industry, according to two people with direct
knowledge of the bill who asked not to be named because it will
be officially presented by tomorrow.  “There’s an expectation for the possibility of flows
coming into the local market demanding Mexican assets ahead of
the energy-reform proposal,”  Mario Copca , a currency and fixed-income strategist at Metanalisis SA, said in a telephone
interview from Mexico City. “This can influence the downward
movement” in yields.  Foreigners boosted holdings of Mexico’s fixed-rate bonds to
a record in May amid speculation the government would open up
the  energy industry  to more private investment, which Pena Nieto
says may help double projected 2013 growth of 2.8 percent.  Mexico’s  Finance Ministry  plans to offer 7.5 billion pesos
($593 million) in fixed-rate government peso bonds maturing in
2023 today as part of its weekly debt auction handled by the
central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
