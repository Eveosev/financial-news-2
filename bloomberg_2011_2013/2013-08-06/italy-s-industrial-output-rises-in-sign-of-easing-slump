Italian industrial  output  increased
in June, indicating the country is slowly emerging from its
longest slump since World War II.  Production rose 0.3 percent from May, when it increased 0.1
percent, national statistics office  Istat  said in Rome today.
That matched economists’ forecasts, according to the median of
20 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Output fell 2.1 percent
in June from a year earlier when adjusted for working days.  Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s government is struggling to
revamp the country’s economy while maintaining the budget rigor
demanded by the European Union. With banks curbing lending to
companies and  consumer spending  hurt by joblessness, the economy
has contracted since the third quarter of 2011. Istat will
release gross-domestic-product data for the second quarter at
11:00 a.m. today.  The  Bank of Italy  predicts the economy will shrink 1.9
percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
