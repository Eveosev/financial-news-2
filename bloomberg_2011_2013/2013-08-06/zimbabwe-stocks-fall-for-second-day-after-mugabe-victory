Zimbabwe ’s main stock index fell for
a second day after President Robert Mugabe won re-election.
Banks stopped issuing new loans and his party said it will press
ahead with a program to force foreign companies to cede assets
to black Zimbabweans or the government.  Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe Ltd ., the biggest bank by market
value plunged 20 percent to 44 cents, adding to yesterdays’ 15
percent decline, and the benchmark Zimbabwe Stock Exchange
Industrial Index declined 2.2 percent after plummeting 11
percent yesterday, Zimbabwe’s IH Securities said in an e-mail.
The mining index fell 6.2 percent. The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange
is yet to release its own figures.  Mugabe’s victory, which extends his 33 years in power, was
rejected by his main rival, Morgan Tsvangirai and his Movement
for Democratic Change, because of allegations that the vote was
unfair because hundreds of thousands of MDC supporters were
prevented from voting.  Most banks in Zimbabwe have stopped making new loans
because of concern about economic policy under the new
government, two chief executive officers of lenders said,
declining to be identified because they didn’t want to anger the
government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
