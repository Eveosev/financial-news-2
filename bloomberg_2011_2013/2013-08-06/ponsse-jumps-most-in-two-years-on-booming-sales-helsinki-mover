Ponsse Oyj, the Finnish maker of
forestry machines, advanced the most in two years in Helsinki
trading after reporting a jump in sales.  The shares gained as much as 11 percent, the most since
Aug. 10, 2011, and rose 9 percent to 6.45 euros at 10:52 a.m.
with volume almost seven times the three-month daily average. It
was today’s  biggest gain  on the Nasdaq OMX Helsinki All-Share
Index.  Ponsse’s  second-quarter  net sales rose 13 percent to 83.6
million euros ($111 million) and its operating profit margin
increased to 10.1 percent of sales from 8.3 percent a year
earlier, according to a statement to the Helsinki stock exchange
today.  “The active demand in the Russian and Finnish markets had
a significant effect on performance in the second quarter,”
Chief Executive Officer Juho Nummela said in a statement. “Our
order intake improved and order books developed favorably.”  Ponsse “significantly extended its foothold” in  Latin
America  and a revival in construction in the North American
market is benefiting the company, it said. Ponsse projected a
positive impact on full-year results from customers’ “positive
work situation,” combined with new products and maintenance
services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
