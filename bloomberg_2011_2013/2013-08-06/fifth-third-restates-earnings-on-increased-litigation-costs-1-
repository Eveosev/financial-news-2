Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) , the largest
lender based in Ohio, said second-quarter earnings were $12
million less than previously reported as it added to a reserve
for litigation costs.  Fifth Third boosted the reserve by $18 million, which
reduced earnings per share by 1 cent, according to a regulatory
filing today by the Cincinnati-based firm. The adjustment means
the bank had net income of $591 million, or 65 cents a share, in
the quarter ended June 30.  “We don’t discuss our reserves related to individual
situations,” Larry Magnesen, a bank spokesman, said in an e-mail. “We have a variety of legal and regulatory matters
pending, and we make adjustments in our reserves for those types
of matters.”  Fifth Third fell 1.4 percent to $19.32 at 11:13 a.m. in New
York. Shares have gained 27 percent this year compared with the
29 percent  advance  of the 24-company  KBW Bank Index. (BKX)   To contact the reporters on this story:
