Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  named Alex Dibelius and Clare Scherrer to new leadership positions at a
unit that provides strategic and financial advice to industrial
clients.  Dibelius was appointed chairman of the global industrials
group and Scherrer co-head, alongside Dusty Philip, according to
an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News, whose contents were
confirmed by the bank.  Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is No. 3 in global
industrials deals this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank advised on transactions including
Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP’s sale of German energy-metering business Ista International GmbH to CVC Capital
Partners Ltd. in April.  Scherrer, currently chief operating officer of the global
industrials group, is the third female executive to be promoted
to a management role at the investment bank this year. The
others include Kate Richdale, who was named the head of
investment-banking services in Asia, and Christina Minnis, who
last month was appointed co-head of healthcare Americas.  Dibelius is currently co-head of the global industrials
group and has overall responsibility for the firm’s business in
 Germany ,  Austria , and Central and Eastern Europe, the memo says.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
