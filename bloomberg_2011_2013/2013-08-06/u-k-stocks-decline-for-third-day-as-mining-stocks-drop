U.K. stocks  retreated for a third day
as a gauge of mining companies declined the most in a month,
outweighing a report that showed manufacturing output climbed
more than forecast.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  lost 11 percent after the gold and silver
producer cut its interim dividend by 68 percent from a year
earlier because precious metals have slumped.  InterContinental
Hotels Group Plc (IHG)  gained the most in almost two years after
posting a 20 percent gain in first-half profit as revenue from
the Americas rose.  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  climbed 2.9 percent
after saying sales increased in the first half of this year.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slid 15.37 points, or 0.2 percent, to
6,604.21 at the close of trading in London. The gauge has still
 rallied 9.5 percent  from a low on June 24 as the  Federal Reserve 
said it remains flexible on the pace of bond buying and as the
 Bank of England  gave forward guidance on  interest rates  for the
first time. The broader FTSE All-Share Index and Ireland’s ISEQ
Index both slipped 0.3 percent today.  “The market has got a bit ahead of itself and any pullback
would make a lot of sense,” said  Andy Lynch , a portfolio
manager at Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in London. “We
have a few companies we’d like to buy at lower levels. Economic
and corporate fundamentals are slowly improving. The Fed can’t
be there forever. You can’t have your parents around all the
time. At some point you have stand on your own two feet.”  U.K.  manufacturing output  increased 1.9 percent in June
after shrinking for two consecutive months, a report from the
 Office for National Statistics  showed today. Total industrial
production  rose  1.1 percent in June, after remaining unchanged
in May. Both readings exceeded the median economist predictions.  Earnings Estimates  Companies on the FTSE 100 will post combined earnings of
522.7 pence a share this year, according to analysts’
 projections compiled  by Bloomberg. That would be a 56 percent
increase from 2012, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Analysts
predicted sales will increase 5.3 percent in 2013.  The U.K. economy will probably grow 1 percent in 2013 and
1.6 percent in 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Last year,
the economy grew at its slowest pace since 2009.  In the U.S., Fed Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher 
told investors yesterday that the central bank will not rescue
them every time asset prices fall.  Fed Stimulus  “Financial markets may have become too accustomed to what
some have depicted as a Fed put,” Fisher said in a speech in
Portland, Oregon. “Some have come to expect the Fed to keep the
markets levitating indefinitely.”  Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans  will speak to
reporters in Chicago after the close of European trading today.  Fresnillo sank 11 percent to 924.5 pence after cutting its
half-year dividend to 4.9 cents per share from 15.5 cents in
2012. Gross profit slumped 27 percent to $518.9 million in the
first six months of the year, the Mexico City-based commodity
producer said in a statement.  A gauge of London-listed  mining companies  dropped 2.9
percent, its largest decline since July 5. Randgold Resources
Ltd. slid 5.6 percent to 4,428 pence as gold traded at its
lowest price in more than two weeks, while Rio Tinto Group lost
1.5 percent to 2,999.5 pence.  InterContinental rallied 6.4 percent 2,030 pence. Operating
profit before exceptional items and tax climbed to $338 million
from $281 million a year earlier, the owner of the Holiday Inn
hotel chain said in a statement. The company also said it will
pay a special dividend totaling $350 million and increase its
interim dividend to 23 cents a share.  Standard Chartered , the lender which  depends  on Asia for
most of its revenue, climbed 2.9 percent to 1,567.5 pence. Sales
increased 6.6 percent to $9.99 billion, as revenue from  Hong
Kong , Africa and India rose, the bank said today.  Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN)  gained 2.3 percent to 201.9
pence, extending its highest price in 14 years. The biggest
manager of U.K. pension-fund assets increased its  interim
dividend  by 22 percent to 2.4 pence a share. That beat the
average analyst estimate of 2.28 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
