Richard Gere’s heart  may be taken , but for a cool $65 million you can have the next best thing — his  Strongheart Manor estate . Property records indicate that the 63-year-old actor is unloading the estate, located at an  undisclosed address in North Haven, NY . The private 6-acre estate with panoramic waterfront views is undeniably one of the most breathtaking spots in all of Long Island. Dock permits allow you to house vessels of your choice, ready to sail on the open waters. The 12,000-square-foot, 12-bedroom, 12-bath mansion boasts vintage East Coast luxury and modern furnishes. Built in 1902, it has a charm reminiscent of Gere’s famous character in “Pretty Woman” — calm but persistent. Factor in the sprawling lawns, blooming gardens, outdoor fireplace pavilion and balconies with unbeatable views, and before you know it, you will be swooning like a lovesick teenager. The neutral-shaded interior of the home holds an appeal that chooses to speak quietly rather than brag. The spacious gourmet kitchen is suitable for whipping up dishes for any household event, from a Sunday brunch to a birthday gala. Since its initial construction, the estate has been renovated and expanded into the opulent property it is today. A notable feature is the tranquil teahouse that sits beside a waterfront pond. For those humid days when you are faced with conflicting desires of avoiding the thick air and basking in the sun, look no further than the home’s large sunroom. Beat the heat with a dip in the pool, shaded by lush trees. In addition to the Strongheart Manor house, 3 single and separate lots house 2 additional guesthouses, perfect for accommodating friends and family during a weekend retreat. Gere may soon be able to qualify for senior citizen discounts but with his lasting good looks and acting skills, there is no slowing down for him. Recent films include the raunchy, star-studded comedy “Movie 43″ and “Arbitrage,” a performance that yielded him a  Golden Globe nomination .
