Tata Power Co. (TPWR)  plunged 15 percent in
Mumbai trading, the  biggest  decline in more than nine years,
after unexpectedly reporting a first-quarter loss.  The  shares  of  India ’s second-largest power generator
declined to 71.40 rupees, the most since May 17, 2004. The stock
has  fallen  35 percent this year, compared with a 3.6 percent
drop in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.  Tata Power reported a group loss of 1.15 billion rupees
($19 million) in the three months ended June 30, compared with a
profit of 1.46 billion rupees a year earlier, the company said
in a stock exchange statement. A Bloomberg survey of 19 analysts
had estimated a profit of 2.2 billion rupees. The rupee’s 8.6
percent plunge in the quarter increased interest costs and led
to currency losses.  Tata Power, which  reported  losses for two straight years,
has written off 26.5 billion rupees as impairment expenses on
its 4,000 megawatt Mundra power plant in the western state of
Gujarat after a regulatory change in  Indonesia  raised imported
coal prices.  “Forex losses have hit the company at the operational
level,” said Sachin Mehta, an analyst with Centrum Broking Pvt.
in Mumbai. “A depreciating rupee makes imported coal costlier
and raises costs for the Mundra plant which was anyway
unprofitable.”  Total Cost  The total cost for the quarter was 79.2 billion rupees,
compared with 63.5 billion rupees a year earlier, according to
exchange filings. Finance costs almost doubled to 9 billion
rupees.  The rupee touched a record low of 61.64 per dollar today.
The currency has weakened almost 11 percent this year, the
biggest decline in Asia after the Japanese yen.  The power utility earned a profit before finance costs and
taxes of 961.9 million rupees from its coal mining business in
the quarter, down 63 percent from a year earlier.  The company is seeking cheaper coal assets in the U.S.,
 Canada  and Colombia, Managing Director Anil Sardana said in an
interview in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
