Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB , Latin
America’s biggest retailer, fell to the lowest level in six
weeks as shopper traffic slowed in July and those that visited
its stores spent less.  Walmex, as the company is known, fell 1.2 percent to 34.42
pesos today in Mexico City trading, the lowest closing level
since June 25. The benchmark IPC index of 35 Mexican companies
was little changed.  Sales at Mexican stores open at least a year fell 3.1
percent in July from a year earlier, the Mexico City-based
company said yesterday in a regulatory filing. Credit Suisse
Group AG had projected a 2 percent decline. Consumers spent less
in each visit, with average purchase sizes declining 0.1
percent, a measure known as average ticket. That’s the first
drop since 2010, according to Credit Suisse calculations based
on  Walmex (WALMEXV)  data. Traffic slowed by 3 percent, the retailer said.  The report “will be a negative catalyst for the shares,”
Credit Suisse analysts including Antonio Gonzalez and Armando
Perez wrote in the research note dated yesterday, citing
“weakness in both ticket and traffic.” The bank maintained its
 recommendation  at the equivalent of sell.  Total sales climbed 0.8 percent to 33.4 billion pesos
($2.64 billion) in the period, according to the Walmex
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
