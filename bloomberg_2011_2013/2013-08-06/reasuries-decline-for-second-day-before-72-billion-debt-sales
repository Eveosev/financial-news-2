Treasuries declined before the
government sells $32 billion of three-year notes amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  may reduce its bond-purchase
program by year-end.  The difference between yields on five-year securities and
10-year notes widened to the most in almost two years as a
report showed the U.S.  trade deficit  narrowed in June to the
lowest level since October 2009. The U.S. is scheduled to sell
$24 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow and $16 billion of 30-year
bonds the following day.  “The market has built in a decent concession out the curve
and we’re back to fairly attractive levels,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in
New York, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“Supply is the main focus of the week.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  climbed two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 2.66 percent at 12:05 p.m. in  New
York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75
percent note maturing in May 2023 dropped 6/32, or $1.88 per
$1,000 face amount, to 92 7/32.  Thirty-year bond yields climbed three basis points to 3.75
percent, touching almost the highest since August 2011.  Yield Difference  The  gap  between yields on five-year notes and 10-year
Treasuries touched 1.26 percentage points today, reaching the
widest since September 2011. Historically, a steeper so-called
yield curve reflects investors anticipating faster economic
growth.  The three-year notes being sold today yielded 0.64 percent
in pre-auction trading. The previous three-year auction, on July
9, drew  bids  for 3.35 times the amount of debt offered, up from
2.95 times on June 11. The yield was 0.719 percent, the highest
level since June 2011.  Indirect bidders, the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 35.6 percent of the securities last month,
the most at the monthly auctions since September.  “There’s definitely still strong demand at auctions,”
said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist in New York at
broker-dealer BTIG LLC. “We think they will still go, but the
August jobs report is going to be crucial,” he said referring
to speculation on Fed cut-backs on its stimulus program this
year.  Treasury Returns  Investors in U.S. government securities have lost 2.8
percent this year, according to the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond
Index. (BUSY)   U.S. debt  gained 2 percent in 2012.  The securities have lost 3.3 percent in the past three
months, according to the index. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
told Congress May 22 that the Fed may cut the pace of bond
purchases if policy makers see indications of sustained growth.
Ten-year yields have climbed from 2.04 percent on that day.  The Fed is buying $45 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion
of mortgage debt each month to put downward pressure on  interest
rates , including $5.65 billion in Treasuries maturing between
May 2018 and April 2019 today.  Tapering of bond-buying “may be delayed if Yellen has a
big vote,” Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  wrote
today in a note on Twitter, referring to  Janet Yellen , the Fed’s
vice chairman.  Policy makers are discussing whether the economy has
improved enough for them to start reducing the purchases. The
central bank’s large-scale asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing, have  swelled  its balance sheet to more than
$3.5 trillion.  Economic Reading  The  U.S. trade deficit  shrank to $34.2 billion from a
revised $44.1 billion in May that was smaller than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported in  Washington . The
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 72 economists called
for a $43.5 billion deficit. Exports increased to an all-time
high while imports fell to a three-month low.  Treasuries investors were neutral this week, as the
percentage of short bets that prices of the securities will fall
equaled bets prices will rise, according to a survey by JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The percentage of investors in the survey betting that
Treasury prices will drop rose to 15 percent in the week ending
yesterday, up from 11 percent the previous week. An equal amount
of 15 percent was also long, down from 17 percent of investors
the previous week. A long position is a bet prices will
increase. About 70 percent of the clients surveyed by the
primary dealer were neutral, just below the 72 percent in the
previous week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
