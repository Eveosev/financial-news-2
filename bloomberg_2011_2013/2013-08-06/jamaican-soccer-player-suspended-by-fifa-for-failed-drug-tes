World soccer governing body FIFA
provisionally suspended a member of Jamaica’s national team for
failing a drug test during  World Cup  qualifying.  FIFA said in a  statement  the player and a Jamaica team
official, neither of whom were identified, were banned for an
initial period of 30 days and that an investigation has been
opened.  The player tested positive in his “A” sample for a
prohibited substance following a qualifying match in  Honduras  on
June 11 and has waived his right to have the “B” sample
analyzed, FIFA said.  Both the player and official have until Aug. 12 to request
a hearing and must submit a statement, along with all related
and supporting evidence, to the governing body by Aug. 19.  FIFA said its anti-doping regulations prohibit the naming
of any players or officials, the prohibited substance or the
consequences imposed until it’s been determined at a hearing
that a violation has occurred.  Jamaican track athletes Asafa Powell, Veronica Campbell-Brown and Sherone Simpson have recently tested positive for
banned substances, although they’ve denied knowingly taking
them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
