Crude oil options volatility fell
with the underlying futures amid speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will reduce stimulus.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September was 21.34 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 4 p.m., down from 22.07 yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery fell
$1.26 to settle at $105.30 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices have
tumbled 2.5 percent since reaching a 16-month high on July 19.  The futures retreated as Fed Bank of Chicago President
 Charles Evans  said he wouldn’t rule out a decision next month to
taper the central bank’s bond-buying program.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $110 calls, which fell 23 cents to 15 cents a barrel
on volume of 4,370 lots as of 4:02 p.m. September $100 puts were
the second-most active, rising 5 cents to 16 cents on volume of
3,073 contracts.  Bullish bets, or calls, made up 54 percent of electronic
trading volume. In the prior session, puts accounted for 55
percent of the 73,235 contracts exchanged.  October $90 puts were the most-active options yesterday
with 5,139 lots exchanging hands as they rose 1 cent to 13 cents
a barrel. October $95 puts gained 2 cents to 38 cents a barrel
on volume of 3,850 contracts.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
38,207 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 36,690 lots
and December $105 calls with 34,635.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
