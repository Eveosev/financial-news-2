The difference between yields on
Treasury three-year notes and 30-year bonds widened to the most
in almost two years before the U.S. sells the securities as part
of its auctions this week.  The so-called  spread  increased to 3.14 percentage points,
the highest level since September 2011, according to closing
price data compiled by Bloomberg. The gap signals investors are
demanding higher yields to own bonds instead of riskier assets
with potentially greater returns, such as stocks, as the economy
grows. The U.S. is scheduled to sell $32 billion of three-year
notes today, $24 billion of 10-year debt tomorrow and $16 billion
of 30-year bonds on Aug. 8.  “The economy is improving,” said Hajime Nagata, who helps
oversee the equivalent of $120.3 billion as an investor in  Tokyo 
at Diam Co., a unit of Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co. “Thirty-year
bonds are not favorable. People prefer to hold stocks.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  were little changed at 2.65
percent as of 8:15 a.m. London time, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader data. The price of the 1.75 percent note due in May 2023
was at 92 10/32. Yields were 0.60 percent on three-year notes
and 3.74 percent for 30-year bonds.  U.S. notes and bonds due in a decade or more are the
world’s worst-performing government securities, indexes tracked
by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies show. The securities fell 10 percent in the three
months ended yesterday, the biggest loss of 144 indexes.  Comparative Returns  Notes due in one to three years were little changed.
Shorter-maturity Treasuries tend to track what the Fed does with
its benchmark  interest rate , which banks charge each other on
overnight loans. Policy makers have kept the target for the rate
in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008.  Stocks in the MSCI All-Country World Index returned 2.7
percent including reinvested dividends, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Reserve Bank  of  Australia  cut its benchmark interest
rates by a quarter point to a record low of 2.5 percent. The
nation’s 10-year  yield  rose 14 basis points to 3.74 percent.  The last U.S. three-year auction on July 9 drew  bids  for
3.35 times the amount of debt offered. The average for the last
10 sales is 3.44 times.  Indirect bidders , the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 35.6 percent of the securities, the most
at the monthly auctions since September.  Improving Economy  Treasuries fell yesterday as a report showed  service
industries  expanded more than forecast in July, adding to signs
the  U.S. economy  is improving and boosting speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will reduce its stimulus program by year-end.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s non-manufacturing
index increased to 56 July from 52.2 the prior month. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists called for a
gain to 53.1.  Data today will show the trade deficit shrank and job
openings increased, according to the surveys.  The Fed is buying $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage
debt each month to put downward pressure on interest rates.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index fell to 72.66 basis points
yesterday, approaching the lowest level since May. The average
in 2013 is 67 basis points.  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was $197.8 billion.
Volume this year has averaged $317.9 billion.  “Yields should slowly trend higher in response to better
growth conditions, resulting in poor total returns,”  Bob Doll ,
a senior investor at Nuveen Investments Inc., wrote on the
company’s  website  yesterday. The Fed will “will begin to
gradually wind down” its bond purchases after its September
meeting, according to Doll, who helps oversee $224 billion at
Chicago-based Nuveen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
