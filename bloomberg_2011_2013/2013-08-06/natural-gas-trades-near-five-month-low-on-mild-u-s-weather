Natural gas fluctuated in New York
near a five-month low amid forecasts for hotter-than-usual
weather in  Texas  that would spur demand from  power plants .  Gas moved between gains and losses as Commodity Weather
Group LLC, predicted above-normal temperatures across most of
Texas through Aug. 20. The high in Dallas on Aug. 19 may be 102
degrees Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), 5 more than average, according
to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania.  “The forecasts through mid-August aren’t looking
supportive,” said  Phil Flynn , a senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “If we don’t see more cooling-degree
days and power generation, it’s going to weigh on the market.”  Natural gas for September delivery fell 0.1 cent to $3.318
per million British thermal units at 10:14 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  after settling at $3.319 per million Btu
yesterday, the lowest closing price since Feb. 22. Trading
volume was 32 percent below the 100-day average. Prices have
declined 1 percent this year.  The discount of September to October futures narrowed 0.1
cent to 2.6 cents.  September $3.20 puts were the most active options in
electronic trading. They were unchanged at 5.4 cents per million
Btu on volume of 152 at 10:10 a.m. Puts accounted for 72 percent
of trading volume. Implied volatility for at-the-money options
expiring in September was 32.71 percent at 10 a.m., compared
with 31.88 percent yesterday.  Texas Weather  “Texas is the only show in town for exceptional heat,”
 Matt Rogers , president of Bethesda, Maryland-based CWG, said
today in a note to clients. Temperatures in the Northeast and
Midwest may be 3 to 5 degrees below the nor from Aug. 11 to Aug.
20, he said.  Electricity generators, the largest consumers of U.S. gas,
will account for 32 percent of demand this year, data show from
the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm.  “The cooler nights of late August get into the minds of
traders about what lies ahead,”  John Kilduff , partner at Again
Capital LLC and editor of the Energy OverView newsletter in New
York, wrote today. “It might not be a bad idea to acquire some
length in the back of the market, ahead of the rush of winter.”  Gas inventories probably expanded by 74 billion cubic feet
last week, based on the median of five  analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Estimates ranged from increases of 64
billion to 79 billion. Supplies rose by 25 billion cubic feet
the same time last year and the five-year average gain for the
period is 42 billion, EIA data show.  Stockpiles totaled 2.845 trillion cubic feet in the week
ended July 26, 1.2 percent below the  five-year average  for the
seven days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
