Canada ’s dollar weakened versus all
of its 16 most-traded counterparts except the South African rand
as commodities including oil, the nation’s biggest export,
dropped for a third day.  The currency traded at almost a two-week low versus the
U.S. dollar amid speculation an Aug. 9 report will say Canada’s
economy failed to create as many jobs in July as economists
forecast after data last week showed U.S. payrolls grew less
than projected. Canadian  government bonds  fell, pushing  10-year (GCAN10YR) 
yields almost to a two-year high.  “We’ve lost our advantage because commodity prices are
much lower, and that’s basically being reflected in the Canadian
dollar,” said Aaron Fennell, a futures specialist at Bank of
 Nova Scotia ’s Scotia McLeod unit, by phone from Toronto.  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is nicknamed for the
image of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, depreciated 0.2
percent to C$1.0377 per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It
reached C$1.0403 on Aug. 2, the weakest level since July 18. One
Canadian dollar buys 96.37 U.S. cents.  The benchmark 10-year government  bond  fell, pushing the
yield up three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.52
percent. The yield climbed as much as six basis points to 2.55
percent after touching 2.60 percent on Aug. 2, the highest since
August 2011. The price of the 1.5 percent security due in June
2023 lost 23 cents today to C$91.22.  Futures on crude oil decreased 0.8 percent to $105.72 a
barrel in  New York  and touched $104.86, the least since July 31,
while Standard & Poor’s  GSCI index  of raw materials dropped 0.7
percent. The S&P 500  Index (SPX)  of U.S. stocks fell 0.6 percent.  Three Months  Canada’s dollar lost 1.6 percent in the past three months
versus nine developed-nation peers tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Index. The currencies of  Australia  and  New
Zealand , fellow commodity exporters, slid 11 percent and 5.5
percent. The greenback rose 2.1 percent.  The Canadian currency remained lower as data showed the
nation’s trade deficit narrowed in June from a May total that
was larger than previously estimated. The  gap  was C$469 million
($453 million), down from a revised C$781 million the prior
month,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast the deficit would be C$510
million, from a previously estimated $300 billion in May.  The nation’s economy is being weighed down by what the  Bank
of Canada  calls the slowest export recovery since World War II,
hampered by a strong currency and a lack of corporate
competitiveness.  Options Premium  The cost to insure against declines in the Canadian dollar
versus its U.S. peer increased to the highest in almost a month.
The three-month so-called 25-delta risk-reversal rate rose to
1.45 percent, matching the most on a closing basis since July
10. Risk reversals measure the premium on options contracts to
sell Canadian dollars versus buying U.S. contracts that do the
opposite.  Implied volatility for three-month options on the Canadian
dollar versus its U.S. counterpart rose to 7.2 percent, from 7.1
percent at the end of last week. It touched 6.8 percent on July
22, the lowest since May 13 on a closing basis, after reaching a
one-year high of 8.9 percent on June 24. Implied volatility is
used to set option prices and gauge the expected pace of
currency swings.  Economists in a Bloomberg survey estimated the government’s
employment report this week will show Canada  added  10,000 jobs
after dropping 400 in June. The  U.S. economy  created 162,000
jobs in July, the Labor Department said Aug. 2, versus a
projection of 185,000.  “All eyes this week are on the employment number in
Canada,” said Blake Jespersen, managing director of foreign
exchange at Bank of Montreal, by phone from Toronto. “Maybe
markets are expecting a slightly weaker number after the
disappointment in the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
