China plans to increase standards for
domestic infant-formula producers amid fresh concerns about  food
safety  after Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. warned of tainted
ingredients in some products.  The government is seeking public feedback on new rules for
the baby-milk industry, according to a  statement  posted on the
China Food and Drug Administration’s website yesterday. The
regulations, published in draft form, will require producers to
own milk sources and have research and development capability,
the agency said.  Fonterra’s announcement this week that it found the
bacteria that causes botulism in about 38 metric tons of whey
protein concentrate it produced is the latest incident in
China’s milk industry. The Auckland-based company in January had
to assure China that traces of an agricultural chemical found in
some milk posed no health risks.  In 2008, locally made melamine-contaminated milk powder
killed six infants in  China . Fonterra’s partner Sanlu Group, one
of 22 companies that sold formula made from tainted milk,
collapsed in the industrywide scandal.  China’s new rules will raise management and production
requirements for the industry, especially on the purchasing of
raw and supplementary materials, according to the CFDA. In a
separate statement, the agency listed the 128 companies licensed
to produce infant formula in China.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
