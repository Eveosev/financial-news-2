Canada ’s trade deficit narrowed in
June as exports rebounded from a two-month slump, led by
shipments of cars and aircraft.  The nation’s trade gap was C$469 million ($453 million)
during the month, down from a revised C$781 million in May,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg forecast the June deficit would be C$510 million, the
median of 20 responses.  Canada’s economy is being weighed down by what the  Bank of
Canada  calls the slowest export recovery since World War II. The
May trade gap was the 18th in a row and extends the longest
streak of deficits in a quarter century. The agency today also
revised the past three monthly merchandise trade balances to
show wider deficits. The gap in May was initially reported at
C$303 million.  The data suggest “trade was a very slight drag on gross
domestic product growth last quarter,”  Doug Porter , chief
economist at Bank of Montreal, said in a note to investors.  The Canadian dollar depreciated 0.3 percent to C$1.0389 per
 U.S. dollar  at 10:05 p.m. in Toronto.  Canada’s economy probably grew by an annualized 1.6 percent
in the second quarter, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  earlier, down from a 2.5
percent pace in the first quarter.  Planes, Automobiles  Exports rose 1.4 percent to C$39.6 billion in June, after
falling 2.5 percent in the previous two months. Aircraft and
other transportation equipment rose 24 percent to C$1.72
billion, while motor vehicle shipments were up 5.5 percent to
C$5.79 billion. Shipments abroad of energy products declined 1.4
percent to C$8.73 billion.  Imports rose 0.6 percent to C$40.0 billion, as energy-product shipments into Canada surged 20 percent to C$3.83
billion, the statistics agency said.  The volume of exports rose 2.1 percent and import volumes
fell 0.5 percent,  Statistics Canada  said. Volume figures adjust
for price changes and can be a better indicator of how trade
contributes to economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
