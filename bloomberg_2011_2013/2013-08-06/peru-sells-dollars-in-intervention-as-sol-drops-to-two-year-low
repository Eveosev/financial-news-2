Peru ’s sol dropped to its weakest
level since May 2011, prompting the central bank to intervene to
bolster the currency.  The sol depreciated 0.3 percent to 2.7990 per U.S. dollar
at today’s close on speculation the Federal Reserve will reduce
stimulus measures that have boosted emerging-market assets. The
currency extended its decline this year to 8.7 percent,
according to prices from Datatec. The difference in yields on
U.S. Treasury five- and 10-year securities was the widest in
almost two years.  With longer-term “Treasury yields gradually climbing,
we’ve seen clients moving to more liquid markets,”  Alejandro Cuadrado , the head of Latin American currency strategy at  Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , said in a phone interview from New
York. “People have been dropping out of the sol trade.”  Banco Central de Reserva del Peru sold $10 million of U.S.
currency in the foreign-exchange market today to stem the sol’s
decline, extending its sales since July 2 to $580 million.  The bank also sold 90 million soles in dollar-linked
certificates of deposit, according to its website. Earlier
today, it offered 300 million soles of the securities, which are
due in two months and were priced to yield 0.25 percent.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due in
August 2020 increased eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage
point, to 5.05 percent at 3:20 p.m. in  Lima , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.49 centimo to 116.23
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
