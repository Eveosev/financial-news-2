Brazil’s real climbed from a four-year low on speculation the central bank will intervene to stem
the currency’s declines to curb inflation.  The real appreciated 0.3 percent to 2.2983 per  U.S. dollar 
at 5:01 p.m. in  Sao Paulo  after falling yesterday to 2.3060, the
weakest since March 2009, boosting import prices. Swap rates on
contracts maturing in January 2015 climbed one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 9.70 percent after falling eight basis
points and dropping 28 basis points last month.  “The central bank is trying to protect the 2.30 per dollar
level because it’s scared inflation is getting out of control,”
 Eduardo Suarez , Latin America currency strategist at Bank of
 Nova Scotia  in Toronto, said in a telephone interview.  The central bank sold $1.7 billion of foreign-exchange swap
contracts on Aug. 2 to support the currency in the 21st day of
auctions since May 31. The real’s three-month historical
volatility was 13.6 percent today, the highest among major Latin
American currencies.  Central bank president Alexandre Tombini said in an e-mailed statement today that proper management of monetary policy
will limit the tendency of a weaker real to quicken inflation.
The monetary authority may sell currency credit lines as needed,
Tombini said.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA index climbed 6.24
percent in July from a year earlier after a 6.70 percent
increase in the prior month, according to the median forecast of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before tomorrow’s report from
the national statistics agency.  Swap rates fell earlier today after the Getulio Vargas
Foundation’s IGP-DI index of wholesale, construction and
consumer prices rose 0.14 percent in July, slower than the 0.20
percent median forecast.  Brazil ’s central bank raised the  target lending rate  by a
half-percentage point on July 10 to 8.50 percent, the third
consecutive increase this year from a record low 7.25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
