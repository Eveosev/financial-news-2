Rebels linked to al-Qaeda overran a
military airport in northern Syrian following months of fighting
and captured several officers and soldiers, the Syrian
Observatory for  Human Rights  said.  The final offensive to seize Minnigh Airport in Aleppo
Province began when two non-Syrian  suicide bombers  detonated an
armored vehicle at the airport’s headquarters yesterday, the
Britain-based group said on its Facebook page. Militants from
the Islamic State of  Iraq  and the Levant, which is affiliated
with al-Qaeda, led the operation, the Observatory said.  At least 10 rebels were killed in the assault, about 37
kilometers (23 miles) north of the city of Aleppo, the group
said, citing reports from a network of activists on the ground.  Syria ’s Information Ministry said troops loyal to President
Bashar al-Assad were clashing with rebels at the airport,
according to state-run SANA news agency.  The facility was not in service and is devoid of military
equipment and aircraft, it said, adding that all the guards
there are fine and “the armed terrorist groups are receiving
very severe losses around and inside the airport.”  The assault is part of an anti-Assad uprising that began in
March 2011 and has killed at least 100,000 people, according to
UN estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
