Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the second-largest U.S. lender, told Pennsylvania regulators that it will
cut 209 jobs from a unit servicing troubled mortgages.  The firm is eliminating positions at 1120 Boyce Road in
Pittsburgh by Sept. 30, according to a  notice  released yesterday
on the Pennsylvania Department of Labor website.  Bank of America has announced more than 1,500 job cuts in
its legacy assets and servicing division this year, shuttering
facilities in Texas, New Jersey and upstate New York. The
business, led by Ron Sturzenegger, had 31,700 full-time
employees at the end of June. That figure will drop as the bank
pushes to reduce costs caused by overdue customers.  “Compared to peak levels in 2011, today we have fewer than
half the numbers of customers who need the specialized programs
and support of this team,”  Jumana Bauwens , a Bank of America
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail.  The company is based in Charlotte, North Carolina and
 employed  more than 257,000 people at midyear, second among U.S.
banks behind  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)   To contact the reporter on this story:
