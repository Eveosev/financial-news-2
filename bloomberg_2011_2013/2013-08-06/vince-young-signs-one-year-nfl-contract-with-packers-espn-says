Quarterback  Vince Young  joined the
Green Bay Packers, returning to the National Football League
after the former first-round draft pick was cut in the preseason
a year ago and went unsigned.  Young, 30, last appeared in an NFL regular-season game in
2011, when he made three starts for the Philadelphia Eagles
after  Michael Vick  was injured. The two-time Pro Bowl selection
was cut by the Buffalo Bills during the 2012 preseason.  Young may compete with Graham Harrell to be the backup to
Packers starting quarterback  Aaron Rodgers . Young had a 31-19
record over six seasons as a starter for the Tennessee Titans
and Eagles, passing for 8,964 yards with 46 touchdowns and 51
interceptions.  The Packers are also interested in seeing whether Young’s
mobility can help them prepare for their first two regular-season games, in which Green Bay’s defense faces Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers and Robert Griffin III of
the Washington Redskins, ESPN reported. The Packers didn’t
disclose financial terms of Young’s one-year contract.  Young was the third pick in the 2006 draft after Mario Williams and  Reggie Bush .  To contact the reporter on this story:
