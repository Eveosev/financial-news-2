Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) ’s board of
directors said there had been no financial impropriety by
Chairman Kolapo Lawson after he repaid loans to the bank.  Lawson has repaid 1.6 billion naira ($10 million) to
Ecobank’s  Nigeria  unit and the board has “unanimously”
reaffirmed its confidence in its chairman, Jeremy Reynolds, a
spokesman at the Lome, Togo-based lender, said by e-mail today.  The Asset Management Corp. of Nigeria, created by Nigeria’s
government to buy lenders’ bad loans in 2010, said last week
that it reached a repayment agreement with Lawson over
outstanding debts owed to the agency.  “The board has made clear that it has no outstanding
concerns and I now wish to concentrate once again on leading
Ecobank to further success,” Lawson said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Founded in 1985, Ecobank has expanded into  France  and 34
African countries. It has representative offices in Beijing,
Dubai, Johannesburg,  London  and Luanda, Angola. The bank’s
assets were $21 billion at the end of June.  Ecobank’s  shares  fell 0.6 percent to 14.61 naira at 12:42
p.m. in Lagos, the Nigerian commercial capital. The stock gained
29 percent this year, compared with a 24 percent gain for the
10-member Nigerian Stock Exchange Banking 10 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
