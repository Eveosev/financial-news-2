Manila Water Co. (MWC)  fell the most in six
weeks in Philippine share trading after a report claimed the
state regulator may reject requests from water distributors in
the nation’s capital to increase rates.  Manila Water sank 4.3 percent to 31.05 pesos at 11:06 a.m.
local time, heading for the sharpest loss since June 24.  Metro
Pacific Investments Corp. (MPI) , owner of Maynilad Water Services
Inc., declined 2.9 percent to 4.95 pesos, bound for the steepest
drop since July 10.  The government may refuse Manila Water and Maynilad Water
Services’s requests, InterAksyon.com reported, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the matter. The regulator may
even cut fees charged by both utilities, according to the
report. Manila Water and Maynilad won government contracts in
1997 to provide water to the Philippine capital. The state
regulator reviews their tariffs every five years.  Emmanuel Caparas, head of Metropolitan Waterworks and
Sewerage System Regulatory Office, didn’t answer mobile phone
calls and text messages seeking comment.  DMCI (DMC) , a shareholder at Maynilad Water, sank 1.2 percent,
heading for a sixth day of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
