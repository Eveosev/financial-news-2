The U.S.  Justice Department  filed
civil claims today against Bank of America Corp. over a 2008
mortgage-bond deal that soured as housing prices collapsed.  The Justice Department announced the suit alleging the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank defrauded investors in
connection with the sale of more than $850 million in
residential mortgage-backed securities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
