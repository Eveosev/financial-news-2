Rubber declined for a second day as a
strengthening Japanese currency reduced the appeal of yen-based
contracts and amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  will soon be
able to cut stimulus.  The contract for delivery in January dropped as much as 1
percent to 243.4 yen a kilogram ($2,484 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange, before trading at 244.4 yen at 11:28
a.m. Futures have fallen 19 percent this year.  The yen rose against all major peers amid speculation the
 Bank of Japan  will refrain from adding to stimulus at a meeting
starting tomorrow. The Institute for Supply Management U.S. non-manufacturing index came in above the median estimate for July,
as Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said
policy makers are closer to slowing bond purchases.  “The decline in rubber is being driven by a stronger
yen,” said Kazunori Kokubo, managing director at Yutaka Shoji
Singapore Pte.  Rubber for delivery in January dropped 0.3 percent to
18,220  yuan  ($2,976) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 77.25 baht ($2.46) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
