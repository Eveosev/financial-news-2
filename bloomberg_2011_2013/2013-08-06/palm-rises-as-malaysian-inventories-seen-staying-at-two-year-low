Palm oil advanced as output in
 Malaysia , the largest producer after  Indonesia , probably
expanded more slowly than a year earlier in July, keeping
inventories at the lowest level in more than two years.  The contract for October delivery climbed 0.3 percent to
2,246 ringgit ($692) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives. Palm oil for local physical delivery in August was
at 2,310 ringgit today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
exchange will be closed from the second half of tomorrow and on
Aug. 8 and 9 for the Eid festival.  Output expanded 10 percent to 1.56 million tons in July
from a month earlier, according to the median of estimates from
two plantation companies and three analysts compiled by
Bloomberg. Production jumped 15 percent from a month earlier in
2012. Reserves held at 1.65 million tons, matching inventories
in June, the lowest since March 2011, the survey showed. Exports
gained 2.7 percent to 1.45 million tons.  “There is an expectation that output will be lower than
last year because we had a bumper harvest in the second half of
the year,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance Investment
Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “Weaker production should keep
stockpiles from rising too quickly. It should keep stocks below
2 million tons for the next few months.”  A weaker currency also supported the market as it made
ringgit-denominated contracts more attractive, which may lead to
an increase in purchases from price-sensitive countries like
India or  Pakistan  in the near term, Tan said. The ringgit fell
2.6 percent last month, the most since May 2012.  Soybean oil for delivery in December fell 0.4 percent to
43.02 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November declined 0.3 percent to $11.7975 a bushel. Refined palm
oil for January delivery fell 0.4 percent to close at 5,422  yuan 
($886) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange. Soybean oil
gained 0.2 percent to end at 7,008 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
