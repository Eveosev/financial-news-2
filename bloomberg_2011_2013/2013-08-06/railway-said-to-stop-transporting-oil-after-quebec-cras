Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway
Ltd.  plans to cease transporting oil, about a month after a
crude-carrying train derailed and exploded in a  Quebec  town, the
Montreal Gazette  reported .  Rail traffic through Lac-Megantic, Quebec, could resume as
early as this week, without petroleum cargo, Chairman Edward Burkhardt said in an interview with the newspaper. The company’s
insurance agreed to cover cleanup costs, though payments haven’t
been made yet, the Gazette said today, citing Burkhardt.  A parked, unmanned train carrying crude rolled downhill
into Lac-Megantic and blew up on July 6, killing 47 people and
incinerating 30 buildings. It’s estimated that 1.5 million
gallons of crude oil were spilled at the scene, according to a
legal complaint filed on July 22.  Burkhardt said in a Bloomberg interview on July 19 that the
carrier, whose parent is closely held Rail World Inc., is
evaluating its financial viability. Messages left today for
Burkhardt at Rosemont, Illinois-based Rail World weren’t
immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
