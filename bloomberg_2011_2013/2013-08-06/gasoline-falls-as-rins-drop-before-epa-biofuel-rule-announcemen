Gasoline slid to a four-week low as
the value for 2013 Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
fell before the government announced final requirements for
blending alternative fuels.  Futures sank as much as 2.2 percent after RINs touched 85
cents, the lowest since May 28, before recovering to 90 cents at
1:50 p.m., data compiled by Bloomberg show. Refiners must buy
the credits in lieu of blending ethanol into gasoline to meet
federal requirements. The Environmental Protection Agency today
gave refiners and blenders more time to meet the rules and more
flexibility.  “This implies they will reduce the requirement in 2014,”
said Mark Anderle, a trader at Truman Arnold Cos. in Dallas.
“This ruling probably creates more questions than answers.”  Gasoline for September delivery declined 3.69 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.9137 a gallon at 1:54 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , on trading volume that was 50 percent above
the 100-day average.  Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners must use a
certain amount of renewable fuels each year, with the amount
based on their share of the fuel market. Refiners can meet their
obligation by blending ethanol into gasoline or by purchasing
credits from other producers. RINs are certificates attached to
each gallon of biofuel. Once the ethanol is added to petroleum,
the blender can keep the RIN to submit to the EPA to show
compliance with the law, or trade it to another party.  Renewable Mandate  The EPA today left unchanged this year’s mandate for
refiners to use a total 16.55 billion gallons of renewable
fuels, while extending the deadline to comply with the 2013
quota by four months, and signaling it plans to reduce the legal
mandate of 18.15 billion gallons set for 2014. Refiners have
appealed to Congress to eliminate the mandate.  Gasoline was also under pressure as  inventories  in the week
ended July 26 were the highest for this time of year in records
going back to 1990, according to data from the Energy
Information Adminstration.  The EIA will probably report tomorrow that gasoline
stockpiles fell 500,000 barrels last week, according to the
median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.  Spot gasoline in the Chicago market slipped 1 cent to an
18-cent discount to futures today as  BP Plc (BP/)  has ramped up rates
on the biggest crude unit at its Whiting, Indiana, refinery to
225,000 barrels a day after being shut in November to be rebuilt
to process mostly heavy Canadian crude.  Inventory Build  “If there is a big product build this week with Whiting
back online, products could get hammered,” said Jason Schenker,
president of Prestige Economics LLC, an Austin, Texas-based
energy consultant. “There’s already elevated risk because of
what’s going on at Whiting.”  Schenker estimates inventories rose 1.2 million barrels.  The motor fuel’s  crack spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 6 cents to $17.42 a barrel.
Gasoline’s  premium  over Brent narrowed 62 cents to $14.61.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, slipped 0.6 cent to
$3.608 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its
website. Prices are 1.1 cents below a year ago.  Distillate stockpiles, including heating oil and diesel
probably held steady, the survey showed.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery declined 4.8
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $3.0042 a gallon on trading volume
that was 22 percent above the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
slipped 48 cents to $21.15 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  fell
$1.13 to $18.36.  To contact the reporter on this story:
