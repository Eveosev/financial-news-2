Standard & Poor’s  cut its outlook on
 Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.  on concern the demise of a
Russia-led venture that trades potash fertilizers will heighten
competition and reduce prices.  S&P reduced Potash Corp.’s ratings outlook to negative from
stable after OAO Uralkali,  Russia ’s largest potash producer,
withdrew last week from a marketing venture, Belarusian Potash
Co., the credit-rating company said today in a statement.
Uralkali also said it planned to increase production volumes to
full capacity.  Potash Corp.’s financial results could be “meaningfully
hurt” by increased competition and lower prices for the crop
nutrient.  “The negative outlook reflects our expectation that
industry conditions in the potash sector could become
significantly more competitive in the near-term thereby
depressing Potash Corp.’s earnings and stretching its credit
metrics beyond our leverage threshold,” S&P said in the
statement.  Up until now, Belarusian Potash, Uralkali’s joint venture
with Belaruskali, and Canpotex Ltd., a venture owned by Potash
Corp. and two other North American producers, have dominated
potash exports by representing their members in supply and
pricing negotiations. That has meant that the producers don’t
compete individually against each other in most export markets.  Potash Corp. rose 1.7 percent to C$30.54 at the close in
Toronto.  The shares  of the Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based company
have fallen 25 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
