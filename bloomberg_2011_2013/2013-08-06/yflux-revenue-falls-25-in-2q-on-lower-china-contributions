Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) ,  Singapore ’s biggest
publicly traded water company, reported a 25 percent drop in
revenue from a year ago in the second quarter, citing lower
contributions from China.  Sales declined to S$138.4 million in the three months ended
June 30 from S$183.6 million in the same period last year,
according to a statement to the Singapore stock exchange
yesterday. Second quarter net income was S$17.7 million, higher
than S$17.5 million a year ago, according to the statement.  The company’s lower revenue from China was due to “macro
factors,” according to the statement. The water company
withdrew from two water projects at the Hechuan Industrial park
in Chongqing City because of a “forseeable low off-take volume
of the water,” it said.  China ’s  economy  grew 7.5 percent from a
year earlier in the April-June period, slowing for a second
straight quarter and extending the longest streak of sub-8
percent expansion in at least two decades.  An interim dividend of 0.7 Singapore cents per share is
declared for the six months ended June 30, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
