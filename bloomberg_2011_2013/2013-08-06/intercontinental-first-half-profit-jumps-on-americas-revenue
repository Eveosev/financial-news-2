InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG) ,
the world’s largest provider of hotel accommodation, said first-half profit rose 20 percent and that it boosted its dividend
after revenue in the Americas region increased. The shares rose
the most in a year.  Operating profit before exceptional items and tax climbed
to $338 million from $281 million a year earlier, the Denham,
England-based company said in a statement today. The company
said it will pay a special dividend totaling $350 million and
increase the interim dividend by 10 percent to 23 cents a share.  “Our high-quality pipeline, broad geographic spread and
fee-based model give us confidence in the outlook, despite the
ongoing challenging economic conditions in some of our
markets,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Solomons said in the
statement.  The owner of the Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza brands is
benefiting from growing demand for accommodation in the
Americas, which account for about half of the company’s sales.
Revenue in the region rose 14 percent to $457 million. Group
revenue increased 7 percent to $936 million.  InterContinental rose as much as 6.9 percent to 2,039 pence
in London trading, the most in a year, making it the best
performer on the  FTSE-100 index , which fell as much as 0.8
percent. The shares have gained 18 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of about 5.3 billion pounds ($8.2
billion).  Revpar Gains  Net income climbed to $340 million, or 126.4 cents a share,
from $271 million, or 91.9 cents, a year earlier. Revenue per
available room, an industry measure of occupancy and sales, rose
3.7 percent globally, the company said. Revpar in the Americas
rose 4.5 percent, compared with a gain of 0.4 percent in Europe
and a 0.1 percent drop in Greater China.  InterContinental is trying to sell its  New York  Barclay
hotel, which it began marketing in May, as the company focuses
on managing hotels instead of owning them.  “This is a particularly challenging asset to sell because
it is in need of a major renovation,” Chief Financial Officer
Thomas Singer said on a call with reporters. “We estimate a new
purchaser will have to invest in excess of $100 million.”  InterContinental in March said it agreed to sell its London
Park Lane Hotel to investors from the Middle East for 301.5
million pounds. At the time, the company said it had sold 191
hotels for $6.1 billion since becoming an independent company in
2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
