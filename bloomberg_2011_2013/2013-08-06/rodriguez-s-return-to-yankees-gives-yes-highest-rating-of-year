The return of Alex Rodriguez to the
 New York  Yankees just hours after he was handed a record-long
drug suspension from baseball helped produce the highest
television rating of the season for the team’s regional network.  Last night’s game between the Yankees and the  Chicago  White
Sox in Chicago drew a 4.3 rating on the Yankees Entertainment &
Sports Network, according to figures provided by YES.  The previous high was a 4.2 for the Yankees’ game against
the New York Mets on May 27, according to YES.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
