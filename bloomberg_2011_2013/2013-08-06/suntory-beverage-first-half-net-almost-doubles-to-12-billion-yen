Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd. (2587) , the
drinks maker that started trading in July after Japan’s largest
public offering this year, reported first-half profit almost
doubled as it pared costs and benefited from a weaker yen.  Net income surged 96 percent to 12 billion yen ($122
million) in the six months ended June from a year earlier, the
beverage maker said today. Sales climbed 11 percent to 518
billion yen.  The weaker Japanese yen boosted sales at Suntory Beverage
by 30 billion yen, Executive Officer Nobuhiro Yasui said at a
press conference in  Tokyo  today. The currency has fallen about
12 percent against the dollar this year as Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe pushed for monetary easing and economic stimulus measures.  The cost reduction helped boost operating profit at its
domestic business by 32 percent to 16.9 billion yen in the first
half, the company said. Net income also benefited from a special
profit of about 3 billion yen from an insurance gain and the
reevaluation of some bottling assets, the company said.  The seller of Boss coffee and Orangina soda, plans to
double sales to 2 trillion yen by 2020. It bought 51 percent of
 PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) ’s soft drink business in  Vietnam  this year.  President Nobuhiro Torii said last month the company could
spend as much as 500 billion yen on acquisitions and will start
internal discussions on targets as early as September.  The beverage group bought France-based Orangina Schweppes
Group for 300 billion yen in 2009 and paid 600 million euros in
the same year for New Zealand’s Frucor Beverages Group.  The parent Suntory Holdings Ltd., which remains unlisted,
owns about 60 percent of the soft drink company. Suntory
Beverage shares have risen 17 percent from its IPO price.  Suntory Beverage listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on July
3 after the biggest initial public offering in  Japan  this year.
The beverage group raised about $4 billion by selling shares at
3,100 yen each, priced near the low end of the indicative range
amid volatile market conditions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
