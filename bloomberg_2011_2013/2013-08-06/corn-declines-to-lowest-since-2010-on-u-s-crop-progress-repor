Soybean futures fell to an 18-month
low on speculation that wet, cool weather will boost crops in
the U.S., the world’s biggest grower. Corn dropped, while wheat
gained.  Cool temperatures are expected in the northern Great Plains
and Midwest, and rain will fall from Missouri to  Tennessee , DTN
said. About 64 percent of the soybean crop was in good or
excellent condition as of Aug. 4, up from 63 percent a week
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  showed yesterday.  “We’re getting some rain throughout the Midwest this
morning, and the forecast is for above-normal precipitation, so
there’s room for prices to go lower,”  Brian Hoops , the
president of Midwest Market Solutions in Springfield, Missouri,
said in a telephone interview.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 1.4 percent to
settle at $11.6725 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Earlier, the price touched $11.6525, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Jan. 17, 2012. The oilseed has
dropped 17 percent this year on speculation that the U.S. crop
will climb to a record in 2013.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$4.5925 a bushel. Earlier, the price touched $4.55, the lowest
since Oct. 4, 2010. In July, the grain dropped 6.3 percent, the
sixth straight decline and the longest slump since 1996.  Wheat futures for September delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$6.505 a bushel.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
