Jamba Inc. (JMBA)  fell the most since 2011
after the seller of juices and snacks reported second-quarter
sales that trailed analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  tumbled 13 percent to $13.92 at 3:09 p.m. in  New
York  after dropping 16 percent, the biggest intraday decline
since Nov. 23, 2011.  Revenue totaled $67.3 million for the quarter that ended
July 2, the Emeryville, California-based company said in a
statement yesterday. The average of six estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was $70.4 million. Earnings per share matched the
36-cent average projection.  “The decline is simply the fact that second-quarter sales
didn’t meet expectations,” Conrad Lyon, a B. Riley & Co.
analyst, said today in a telephone interview. “The majority of
names in the restaurant sector have displayed similar results.
Some have postulated that it’s consumers firing all the
gunpowder on buying big-ticket items, be it cars, or be it
second homes, refinancing homes, sucking up their discretionary
cash.”  Lyon, who is based in  Los Angeles , recommends buying the
stock. Jamba  shares  had gained 43 percent this year through
yesterday, as the Russell 2000 Index rose 25 percent.  Jamba seeks to boost future sales through a long-term focus
on labor and supply-chain strategies, as well as marketing
initiatives, Chief Executive Officer  James White  said on a
conference call yesterday.  The company maintained its forecasts of 2013 growth in
comparable sales from company-owned stores of 4 percent to
6 percent and annual revenue from consumer packaged goods
$4 million to $5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
