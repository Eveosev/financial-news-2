Slovak residential property prices
fell 0.8 percent from April to June for a second quarterly drop,
as rising unemployment depressed demand for housing, the central
bank said.  The average price for residential property declined to
1,230 euros ($1,631) per square meter (10.8 square feet) from
April to June, compared with 1,240 euros in the first quarter,
Narodna Banka Slovenska said on its website today in the capital
Bratislava. Prices gained 0.2 percent from a year earlier.  The economy of the export-oriented eastern euro-area member
is slowing because of the blocâ€™s debt crisis, driving
unemployment to a nine-year high earlier this year. The average
price of residential property has fallen 21 percent from a peak
in the second quarter of 2008.  Prices varied from 587 euros a square meter in the Nitra
region of western Slovakia, to 1,667 euros in the capital,
Bratislava.  To contact the reporter on this story:
