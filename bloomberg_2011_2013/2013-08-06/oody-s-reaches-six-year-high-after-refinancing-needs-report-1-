Moody’s Corp. (MCO)  climbed to the highest
level in more than six years after the owner of the second-largest credit rater released a report forecasting corporate
borrowers will have “significant” refinancing needs.  Shares rose 2.5 percent to $70.96 in  New York  trading, the
most since June 2007. Non-financial corporate issuers have
“significant refunding needs, especially in 2016 and 2017,”
New York-based Moody’s said in a slide presentation  posted  today
on its website.  Demand for ratings services has boosted earnings as
companies take advantage of borrowing costs that reached a
record low last quarter. Yields on corporate bonds fell to an
unprecedented 3.09 percent on May 2, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate & High Yield Index.
Global issuance of $2 trillion in the first six months exceeded
offerings for the corresponding period in 2012, when a record
$3.98 trillion was sold for the full year, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Moody’s, whose founder John Moody helped start the credit
ratings business in 1909, reported second-quarter  revenue  of
$537.3 million from grading debt, advancing from $441.2 million
in the similar 2012 period, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales from company ratings increased 37 percent to
$262.9 million from $191.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
