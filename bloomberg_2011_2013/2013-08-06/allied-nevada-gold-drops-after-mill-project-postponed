Allied Nevada Gold Corp. (ANV) , the
operator of the Hycroft mine in  Nevada , fell the most in more
than four years after posting a drop in earnings and deferring
plans to build a processing plant at the site.  Allied Nevada, which said in April it might build the
130,000-ton-a-day mill in phases, declined 26 percent to $4.37
in  New York , the biggest slide since December 2008.  Second-quarter net income fell to $4.23 million, or 4 cents
a share, from $6.14 million, or 7 cents, a year earlier, the
Reno, Nevada-based company said today in a statement. Revenue
rose 75 percent to $59 million.  Production and sales from Hycroft, in northern Nevada,
didn’t meet forecasts because of problems with the leach-pad
process, which is used to extract metal from the ore, Allied
Nevada said July 22. The company, which is working on a plan to
improve leaching, is also grappling with  gold prices  that have
dropped 23 percent this year.  “ Cash flow  from operations remains weak, partly resulting
from the sharp gold and silver price declines during the second
quarter,” Allied Nevada said in today’s statement.  The company said it will defer construction of the mill at
Hycroft until it has completed a new feasibility study to
optimize the project. There’s no forecast on how long that may
take or what the project may eventually cost, Allied Nevada
said.  Hycroft will process at a reduced rate until 2021, Adam Graf, a New York-based analyst at Cowen Securities LLC, said in
a note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
