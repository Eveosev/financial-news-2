London  Mayor Boris Johnson said he
will stage a repeat next year of the  Ride London 100  cycling
event that led to traffic disruption on Aug. 4.  Roads in the U.K. capital and bridges over the River Thames
were closed for the event, which involved nearly 16,000
cyclists, leading to complaints over the shutdown and consequent
traffic jams. Johnson heard more criticism in his monthly phone-in show on London’s LBC radio station today.  “I want to renew my apologies to all the people driving
around London who felt inconvenienced,” the mayor said. “But I
do think it was worth it, folks.”  The event, sponsored by Prudential Plc and organized by the
mayor’s office, saw amateur cyclists including Johnson pedal a
100-mile (160-kilometer) route through London and into Surrey,
to the southwest of the city, as well as a professional road
race.  Johnson also said he has been told that a tricycle is being
built in the style of London’s Barclays Plc-sponsored hire bikes
as a gift from the mayor for Prince George, the son of Prince William and third in line to the U.K. throne, who was born on
July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
