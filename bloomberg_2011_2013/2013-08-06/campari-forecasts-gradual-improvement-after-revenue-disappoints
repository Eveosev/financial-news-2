Davide Campari-Milano SpA (CPR) , the maker
of Skyy vodka and Wild Turkey bourbon, said it expects
“gradual” improvement in the second half after reporting sales
in the first six months of 2013 that missed analyst estimates.  Revenue advanced to 698.6 million euros ($928 million)
from 618.3 million euros a year earlier, the Milan-based company
said in a statement today. Analysts on average predicted revenue
of 711 million euros, according to a survey compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales excluding the effect of acquisitions and
disposals slid 3.3 percent, partly due to a change in Italy’s
shipment laws.  “We expect the business to continue improving gradually
over the second half of 2013, driven by sustained brand building
across key brand-market combinations and the strengthening
resonance of the brand portfolio in new geographies,” the
company said.  Chief Executive Officer Bob Kunze-Concewitz is bringing
Campari products to new markets and expanding into new
categories as a sluggish economy restrains growth in  Europe .
Campari added Appleton rum to its portfolio last year with the
acquisition of Lascelles DeMercado & Co.  Campari shares rose as much as 2.6 percent and were up 2.5
percent at 6.085 euros at 11:44 a.m. in Milan. The stock has
gained about 8 percent in 12 months.  The distiller returned to a “positive organic
performance” in the second quarter, it said, with sustained
growth in  North America ,  Russia  and  Argentina .  Earnings before interest and taxes fell to 120.5 million
euros in the period, from 143.8 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
