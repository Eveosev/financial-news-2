Tunisia’s  Societe Nouvelle Maison de la Ville de Tunis , which operates French supermarket chain Monoprix, plans to open 57 branches in  Libya  even as sporadic violence threaten to further destabilize the North African nation.  The company will open a branch in November and another two in 2014, Karim Benkhir, Monoprix’s branch manager in the capital, Tripoli, said in an interview Aug. 1. While the company aims to complete the expansion plan within five years, it’s aware there is a possibility of delays, he said.  SNMVT plans to expand Monoprix’s network even as armed militia, who helped depose and kill late President  Muammar Qaddafi  in 2011, use violence to influence political and economic decisions.  Six branches are planned in Tripoli, Benkhir said. The nation’s first Monoprix supermarket receives an average of 1,200 visitors a day, up from 757 when the branch first opened, Benkhir said. More than 90 percent of the stocked goods are imported, he said.  SNMVT also plans to expand to  Egypt  and  Algeria , Benkhir said without providing details. The company’s shares have declined 5.2 percent this year to 26.09 dinar yesterday. That compares with an 0.06 percent gain in the benchmark Tunis Stock Exchange index.
