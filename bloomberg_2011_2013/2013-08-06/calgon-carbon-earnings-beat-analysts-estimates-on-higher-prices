Calgon Carbon Corp. (CCC) , the Pittsburgh-based provider of water-purification systems, reported second-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates as prices
increased.  Net income increased 19 percent to $13 million, or 24 cents
a share, from $10.9 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier,
Calgon said today in a statement. That exceeded by 2 cents the
average of seven analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales fell 5.4 percent to $140.4 million. The drop was offset by
increased prices and higher demand in Japan, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
