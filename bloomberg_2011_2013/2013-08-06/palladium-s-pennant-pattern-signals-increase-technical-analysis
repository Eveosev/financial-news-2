Palladium, the only precious metal
posting a gain this year, will extend a rally if the price
breaks above a pennant formation, according to technical
analysis by Matt McKinney at Zaner Group LLC.  The pennant, formed by a series of lower highs and higher
lows with narrower intraday ranges, signals a “breakout,”
McKinney said. The price will rise 6.8 percent to $772 an ounce
by the end of the month from yesterday’s settlement if the metal
tops $754 in the next week, he said. The commodity rose 9.9
percent last month after slumping 12 percent in June. The 50-day
moving average topped the 100-day measure yesterday for the
first time since May.  “It looks ready to go up the way it came down,” McKinney
said in a telephone interview from  Chicago . “Also, if the 50-day is able to break meaningfully above the 100-day average, it
will be bullish for the long term.”  Through yesterday, palladium futures in New York gained 2.8
percent this year to $722.80. Silver tumbled 35 percent, gold
slumped 23 percent and palladium dropped 7.4 percent.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts use charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
