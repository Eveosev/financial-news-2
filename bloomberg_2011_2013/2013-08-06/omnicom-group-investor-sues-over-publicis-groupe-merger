An  Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC)  investor sued
to stop the company’s proposed merger with  Publicis (PUB)  Groupe SA, a
combination that would create the world’s biggest advertising
company, saying the terms are unfair to Omincon shareholders.  Shareholder Paul Ansfield filed the suit in New York State
Supreme Court against Omnicom, its board and Publicis over the
transaction, which was unveiled on July 29. Pending regulatory
and stockholder approvals, the deal is expected to be completed
by the first quarter of 2014.  “Defendants have attempted to spin the proposed
transaction as ‘merger of equals,’ even though Omnicom
stockholders are being forced to give up much more for their
portion of the combined company than Publicis is giving up for
their portion of the combined company,” Ansfield said in a
court filing.  If approved, the union of Paris-based Publicis and New
York-based Omnicom will overtake market leader WPP Plc, creating
an advertising powerhouse with $35 billion in market value and
about 41 percent of total spending by the top 10 media agencies
in the world, according to data compiled by Advertising Age.  Joanne Trout, a spokeswoman for Omnicom in  New York , said
by phone she didn’t have an immediate comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Ansfield v. Wren, 652737/2013, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
