Shuaa Capital PSC (SHUAA) , the investment
bank controlled by Dubai’s ruler, posted its first quarterly
profit in almost two years as the company’s asset management and
investment banking divisions boosted revenue.  Shuaa, which has reported  quarterly losses  since the third
quarter of 2011, said second-quarter profit was 1.3 million
dirhams ($354,000) compared with a 15.9 million-dirham loss a
year earlier, according to a statement to the Dubai stock
market. Revenue rose 95 percent to 43.4 million dirhams.  The bank, which has reported annual losses since 2008 as
the global financial crisis led to a drop in volumes on local
stock markets, completed a restructuring program to reduce
assets, cut jobs and generate recurring revenue. The company
stopped offering retail brokerage and said in October it plans
to boost lending to small and medium-sized businesses and high-net-worth individuals to improve profit margins.  “We have continued to deploy our balance sheet lending to
companies both in the U.A.E. and in  Saudi Arabia , where there is
significant demand for secured asset-backed lending,” Executive
Chairman Sheikh Hasher Al Maktoum said in the statement.  Shuaa’s assets at the end of June were 1.4 billion dirhams,
including 241 million dirhams in cash, as well as a slight
reduction in liabilities to 265 million dirhams.  To contact the reporters on this story:
