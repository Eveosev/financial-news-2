Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Inc. (RBA) , the
industrial equipment auctioneers, soared the most in four years
after reporting better-than-estimated earnings and boosting its
dividend.  Ritchie, based in Burnaby, British Columbia, jumped 7.4
percent to C$20.74 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the biggest gain since
May 2009. The shares are little changed this year.  The company  posted  adjusted second-quarter earnings of 28
cents a share, ahead of the 27-cent average estimate of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Ritchie conducted 72 auctions in 14 countries in the
quarter. Auction revenue rose 1 percent to $128.3 million
compared with $127.2 million in the same period a year ago, the
company said in a release.  “We continue to make progress in growing our sales force
and delivering solid results from our ‘at risk’ business, and we
believe the full impact of those strategies will be demonstrated
in our future performance,” said  Peter Blake , Ritchie’s chief
executive officer, said in a statement.  The company raised its quarterly  dividend  to 13 cents a
share from 12.25 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
