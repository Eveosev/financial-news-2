YuMe Inc. (YUME) , a provider of online-video
advertisements, is pricing its initial public offering below the
expected range, said a person with knowledge of the deal.  The IPO, set for later today, will come in lower than the
$12 to $14 a share the company projected in its  prospectus , said
the person, who asked not to be named because the terms haven’t
been disclosed. Scott Lahde, a YuMe spokesman, declined to
comment.  Tremor Video Inc. (TRMR) , a YuMe competitor, has slid 20 percent
since its IPO in June, a sign of weakening investor demand. At
the bottom of the range, Redwood City, California-based YuMe
would be valued at $380 million, less than Tremor’s market
capitalization of $397.4 million. Both companies compete with
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  and a host of startups in the video-ad market.  Based on sales in the 12 months that ended in March, at $12
a share YuMe would be valued at 3.1 times revenue, compared with
a  price-to-sales  ratio of 3.5 for Tremor and 5.2 for Google.
YuMe’s first-quarter revenue rose 33 percent to $26.6 million
from $20.1 million a year earlier, and the company’s net loss
widened to $3.34 million from $1.49 million.  Like many technology companies when they go public, YuMe
warned in its prospectus that it “may not be profitable in the
future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
