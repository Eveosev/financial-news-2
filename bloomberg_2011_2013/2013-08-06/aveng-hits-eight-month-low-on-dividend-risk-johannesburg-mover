Aveng Ltd. (AEG) , a South African builder,
fell to the lowest in eight months on concern deteriorating
fiscal 2013 earnings may put the company’s dividend at risk.  The stock fell as much as  6.1 percent  in Johannesburg and
closed down 2.6 percent at 26 rand, the lowest price since Nov.
29, for a market value of 10.1 billion rand ($1.02 billion).
Trading volume was 50 percent above the three-month daily
average. The share lost 11 percent yesterday.  Aveng, based in Johannesburg, said yesterday headline
fiscal 2013 earnings will be as much as 10 percent lower than a
year earlier. Labor disruptions are delaying projects and
hurting profitability, the company said in a statement.  “Aveng indicated that its South African and African
division is likely to see losses widen on lower revenue, margin
compression as well as significant increase in loss
provisions,” Dirk Noeth, a Cape-Town based analyst at Avior
Research (Pty) Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“This, along with a capital demand from its mining division is
expected to have an adverse afffect on cash balances which, in
our view, could put the dividend at risk.”  The stock has fallen 14 percent over two days, losing 1.6
billion rand in value. Aveng now trails rival  Murray & Roberts
Holdings Ltd. (MUR)  by 380 million rand in market capitalization, data
compiled Bloomberg show.  “The share reaction is a bit of a knee-jerk reaction, but
also reflective of a loss of investor confidence,” Noeth said.
“At current levels, its probably overdone.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
