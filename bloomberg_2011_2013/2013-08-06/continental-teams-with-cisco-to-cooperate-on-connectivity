Continental AG (CON) , Europe’s second-largest auto-parts maker, is teaming with  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  to
work on developing technology for connected vehicles.  “We believe that the Internet does not just come into the
car, but that the car becomes a part of the Internet,”
Continental Chief Executive Officer Elmar Degenhart said in a
statement. “We think the best way to unlock the opportunities
of the connected vehicle is to look for collaborations.”  Continental and Cisco, the biggest maker of networking
equipment, today are showcasing a connected vehicle at the
Center for Automotive Research’s annual seminar in Traverse
City,  Michigan . Internet connectivity has become critical for
carmakers as customers demand vehicles with more technology.  Stuttgart, Germany-based  Daimler AG (DAI)  will provide live
traffic information and a Wi-Fi hotspot in the next-generation
Mercedes-Benz S-Class coming out later this year. The long-term
objective of many automakers is to provide fully automated
driving which would require a stable and secure Internet
connection.  “The objective is to start development projects with
carmakers as soon as possible,” Continental spokesman Sebastian
Fillenberg said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
