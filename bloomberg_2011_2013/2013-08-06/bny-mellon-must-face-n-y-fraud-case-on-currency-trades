Bank of New York Mellon Corp.  must
face a lawsuit by the New York Attorney General that accuses the
world’s largest custody bank of defrauding clients in foreign-exchange transactions.  Justice  Marcy Friedman  of New York state Supreme Court in
in Manhattan ruled fraud claims brought by the state Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman can proceed, according to a decision
dated yesterday.  BNY Mellon was sued in 2011 by Schneiderman, who accused
the bank of a 10-year fraud through the pricing of foreign-exchange transactions for private and government clients.
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara also has a lawsuit pending
against the bank over the same issue.  BNY Mellon spokesman Kevin Heine didn’t immediately comment
by e-mail on the judge’s decision.  The case is People of the State of New York v. Bank of New
York Mellon Corp., 114735-2009, New York state Supreme Court
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
