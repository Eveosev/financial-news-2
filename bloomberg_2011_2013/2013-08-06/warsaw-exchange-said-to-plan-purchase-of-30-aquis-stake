The  Warsaw Stock Exchange  is in talks to buy a 30 percent stake in Aquis Exchange Ltd., the London-based trading system, as central Europe’s largest bourse seeks to expand outside its home market, according to three people familiar with the situation.  The purchase would make the Polish company the biggest shareholder in Aquis and give the Warsaw bourse a seat on the board, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the talks are private. Aquis will remain an independent company with its own trading system, they said. Aquis would like to raise as much as 13 million pounds ($20 million) from the sale, according to two of the people.  The Warsaw bourse, founded two years after  Poland ’s communist government collapsed in 1989, is expanding overseas as Chief Executive Officer Adam Maciejewski seeks growth. The exchange and the Vienna bourse said in April they will decide in a few months whether to start advanced merger negotiations after the Austrian operator proposed “friendly” consolidation.  Spokesmen for the Warsaw exchange and Aquis declined to comment on the company’s plans.  The Polish exchange lists 443 companies on its main market, including PKO Bank Polski SA, the largest bank in Poland, and PZU SA, the country’s biggest insurer, with a combined value of 777 billion zloty ($246 billion). Trading volume has soared almost four-fold over the past decade.  Index Boost  The Warsaw bourse said today it will boost the size of its benchmark index to 30 companies from 20 to help increase trading volumes and attract new listings.  Alasdair Haynes, the former chief executive officer of alternative trading venue Chi-X  Europe  Ltd., founded Aquis last year. The platform plans to begin operations in October, offering trading of stocks listed on Europe’s 15 biggest markets, and is working to win U.K. regulatory approval. If the sale to Warsaw proceeds, employees will own 25 percent of Aquis and private investors will hold 45 percent.  Haynes led Chi-X Europe until rival Bats Global Markets Inc. bought the company in 2011.
