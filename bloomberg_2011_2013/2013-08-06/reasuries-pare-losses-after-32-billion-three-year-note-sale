The  difference  in yields on Treasury
five-year and 10-year securities reached the widest in almost
two years as a narrowing  U.S. trade deficit  added to signs the
economy is recovering as the  Federal Reserve  considers reducing
its bond-buying plans.  Benchmark 10-year notes pared losses as the U.S. sold $32
billion in three-year securities at a yield of 0.631 percent,
compared with a forecast of 0.636 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of eight of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers. Fed Bank of
 Chicago  President  Charles Evans  indicated that a tapering of the
central bank’s bond-buying program in September is possible.  “There’s a steepening of the curve,” said Justin Lederer,
an interest-rate strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in  New York ,
a primary dealer. “We’re looking at data and we’re seeing what
the Fed does. We’ll see if the September tapering is in place or
if it gets pushed backed.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  climbed one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2.64 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note
maturing in May 2023 dropped 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 92 11/32.  The yield on the current three-year note was little changed
at 0.6 percent.  Yield Curve  The  difference  between yields on five-year notes and 10-year Treasuries reached 1.26 percentage points today, touching
the widest since September 2011. Historically, a steeper so-called yield curve reflects investors anticipating faster
economic growth.  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was $248 billion, down
from the average of $316 billion this year.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was 78.18. The figure has
fallen from 117.89 on July 5, which the highest level since
December 2010.  Investors in U.S. government securities have lost 2.8
percent this year, according to the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond
Index. (BUSY)   U.S. debt  gained 2 percent in 2012.  The securities have lost 3.3 percent in the past three
months, according to the index. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
told Congress May 22 that the Fed may cut the pace of bond
purchases if policy makers see indications of sustained growth.
Ten-year yields have climbed from 2.04 percent on that day.  Fed View  The Fed’s Evans, speaking to reporters today, said the
central bank probably will have bought at least $1.2 trillion of
bonds from January 2013 until the time he sees the current
quantitative-easing program ending in mid-2014.  “We’ve seen good improvement in the labor market, there’s
no question in my mind about that,” Evans said in Chicago.
“I’m still wanting to see greater evidence that it’s a
sustainable improvement” and “I would clearly not rule” out a
decision to begin dialing back the purchases in September.  A report Aug. 2 showed the U.S. added 162,000 jobs in July
and the  unemployment rate  dropped to 7.4 percent, the lowest
since December 2008.  The Fed is buying $45 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion
of mortgage debt each month to put downward pressure on  interest
rates .  Jobs Data  “We think they will still go, but the August jobs report
is going to be crucial,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global
strategist in New York at broker-dealer BTIG LLC, referring to
speculation on Fed cut-backs on its stimulus program this year.  The central bank’s large-scale asset purchases have  swelled 
its balance sheet to more than $3.5 trillion.  Treasury yields rose earlier as a report showed a narrowing
deficit. The U.S. trade deficit shrank 22.4 percent to $34.2
billion from a revised $44.1 billion in May that was smaller
than previously estimated, the Commerce Department reported
today in  Washington .  The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of 72 economists
called for a $43.5 billion deficit. Exports increased to an all-time high while imports fell to a three-month low.  At today’s auction of three-year notes,  indirect bidders ,
an investor class that includes foreign central banks, purchased
41.4 percent of the notes, the highest level since August 2011
and compared with an average of 26.1 percent for the past 10
sales.  Auction Detail  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with an average of 19.9 percent
for the past 10 auctions.  Today’s offering is the first of three note auctions this
week totaling $72 billion. The government will sell $24 billion
in 10-year debt tomorrow and $16 billion in 30-year securities
on Aug. 8.  The sales will raise $2.4 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $69.6 billion, according to
the  U.S. Treasury .  Investors bid $2.92 for each dollar of the $1.289 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
