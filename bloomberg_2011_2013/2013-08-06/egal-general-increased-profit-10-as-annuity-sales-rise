Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN) , the
biggest manager of U.K. pension assets, reported a 10 percent
increase in first-half profit, boosted by acquisitions and sales
of annuity products.  Operating profit  climbed to 571 million pounds ($876
million) in the six months to June 30, compared with 518 million
pounds a year earlier, the London-based company said today in a
statement. That fell short of the 582 million-pound average
forecast of 19 analysts provided by the company.  “Bulk annuities and related retirement solutions for
corporates are up ten-fold,” Chief Executive Officer Nigel Wilson said in the statement. “We are successfully evolving our
strategy from a post-financial crisis focus on cash, to one
based on cash plus growth plus selective acquisitions.”  The firm raised its interim dividend 22 percent to 2.40
pence a share, beating analysts’ estimate of 2.28 pence. Net
cash generation climbed 23 percent to 500 million pounds, while
individual annuity sales jumped 44 percent to 754 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
