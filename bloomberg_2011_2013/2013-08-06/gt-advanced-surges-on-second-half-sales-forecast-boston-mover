GT Advanced Technologies Inc. (GTAT) , a U.S.
supplier of manufacturing equipment for solar and energy-efficient lighting products, gained after saying second-half
sales will increase.  GT Advanced advanced 5.6 percent to $5.47 at the close in
New York, the most since July 30.  In the third and fourth quarters of this year “we do
expect a real pickup in order rates,” Chief Executive Officer
Tom Gutierrez said on a conference call today.  Second-quarter sales for the Merrimack, New Hampshire-based
company increased less than 1 percent to $168.3 million from a
year earlier. GT Advanced reiterated yesterday that full-year
revenue would be $500 million to $600 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
