Apache Corp. (APA)  said it’s unsure whether
it will be able to secure long-term extensions for exploration
concessions on almost 3 million acres in Egypt that were set to
expire at the end of the year.  Egypt has granted six-month extensions for concessions
expiring this year, the Houston-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. As of the end of 2012, Apache had
almost 3 million net undeveloped acres that were to expire at
the end of 2013, with more than 285,000 expiring next year and
more than 954,000 set to expire in 2015, the filing showed.  “We continue to seek longer term extensions but cannot
assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis
or otherwise on terms agreeable” to the company and  Egypt ,
Apache said in today’s filing. “There are currently no reserves
recorded on this undeveloped acreage and Apache will not make
future investments in these areas unless the present concessions
are extended.”  Egypt’s military removed the country’s president from power
in July. Apache’s operations in the western desert of Egypt
haven’t experienced production interruptions, according to
today’s filing, and the company has continued to see development
lease approvals for its drilling plans.  “Renewing concessions is a normal part of doing business
internationally,” Bill Mintz, an Apache spokesman, said in a
phone interview today. He said the company is discussing the
matter with Egypt and remains an active driller in the country.
The company plans to continue its exploration program on other
concessions, Mintz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
