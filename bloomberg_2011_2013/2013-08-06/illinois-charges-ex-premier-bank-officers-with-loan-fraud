Four ex-Premier Bank executives were
charged with fraud for soliciting bribes for loans, hiding poor
financial conditions and using federal bailout money in a scheme
that cost taxpayers $70 million when the bank failed.  The defendants, former directors and officers of state-chartered Premier Bank of Wilmette,  Illinois , were arrested at
their homes on July 10 and arraigned today in Cook County
Criminal Court on a multi-count indictment, Illinois Attorney
General Lisa Madigan said in an e-mailed statement.  The bank failed more than a year ago, resulting in a loss
of $64.1 million to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Madigan
said. The case couldn’t be immediately confirmed through court
records.  Defendant Zulfikar Esmail of Evanston, Illinois, engaged in
a criminal shakedown scheme, demanding bribes and ownership
stakes for his children from a grocer seeking loans and lines of
credit, Madigan said. Esmail also ordered construction work to
be done at his home and had invoices made to show the work was
done on the bank, she alleged.  Bank officers submitted fraudulent reports to the state
misrepresenting the bank’s financial condition, and received
$5.6 million in taxpayer money from the Troubled Asset Relief
Program to further the scheme, Madigan said.  There was no listing for Esmail in directory assistance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
