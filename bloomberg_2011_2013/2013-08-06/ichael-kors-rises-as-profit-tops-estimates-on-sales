Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. (KORS) , the
luxury-goods company founded by the designer of the same name,
rose the most in three months after first-quarter profit topped
analysts’ estimates amid surging North American sales.  The shares  climbed  3.7 percent to $70.39 at the close in
New York, the biggest gain since April 25. The Hong Kong-based
company’s shares have risen 38 percent this year, compared with
a 19 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Profit in the quarter ended June 29 was 61 cents a share,
and revenue increased 54 percent to $640.9 million, the company
said in a statement today. Analysts estimated profit of 49 cents
and sales of $571.6 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue in North America, Kors’s largest region, rose
46 percent.  “Our exceptional first quarter financial results
demonstrate the sustained strong demand for the Michael Kors
luxury brand,” Chief Executive Officer John Idol said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
