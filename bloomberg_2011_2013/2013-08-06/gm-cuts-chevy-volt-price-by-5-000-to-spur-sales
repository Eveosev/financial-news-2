General Motors Co. (GM) , facing
disappointing Chevrolet Volt sales, cut the starting price of
the plug-in hybrid sedan by $5,000 to compete against the less-expensive and better-selling Toyota Prius and Nissan Leaf.  The 2014 Volt, arriving in U.S. dealerships later this
month, will start at $34,995, the Detroit-based automaker said
today in an e-mailed statement. The price cut comes, in part, to
make sure the Volt shows up in online shopping searches along
with the Prius and Leaf, which start, respectively, at  $25,010 
and  $29,650 , including destination fees, GM said.  “GM is getting with the times,” Michelle Krebs, a senior
analyst with Edmunds.com, a website that tracks auto pricing,
said in an e-mail. “Consumers want electric and plug-in hybrid
vehicles at prices competitive with other vehicles without the
advanced technology.”  GM loses money on each Volt it sells while not disclosing a
specific figure. The model, which is eligible for a $7,500 U.S.
tax credit, was introduced in 2010 and has struggled to meet
some sales targets. Volt is GM’s flagship car for its efforts to
have about 500,000 vehicles on the road by 2017 with some form
of electrification. The car can travel 38 miles (61 kilometers)
on battery power before a gasoline engine engages.  “We have made great strides in reducing costs as we gain
experience with electric vehicles and their components,”  Don Johnson , Chevrolet U.S. sales vice president, said in the
statement.  Volt Sales  While Volt sales rose 9.2 percent through July, deliveries
slipped 3.3 percent last month. That followed a 53 percent gain
in June when the average cost of incentives per Volt was $6,195,
according to Edmunds, citing the most recent month with
available data.  Leaf sales accelerated this year after  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  in
January added an S version of the Leaf that’s cheaper than the
SV and SL models. Unlike the Volt, the Leaf has no extended
range engine. Leaf sales more than tripled to 11,703 through
July from 3,543 during the same period a year earlier,
outselling Volt in the U.S. by 60 vehicles.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Prius is the most frequently traded-in
vehicle for a Volt, GM said in the statement.  U.S. sales of the Prius were little changed through July
with 143,508 deliveries. Those results include sales of a plug-in version of the Prius, which saw deliveries slip 8.3 percent,
according to researcher Autodata Corp. The plug-in Prius starts
at  $32,810 . Toyota also sells a subcompact Prius c that sells
for  $19,890 .  Consumer Reports  GM fell 2.1 percent to $35.96 at the close in  New York . The
shares have surged 25 percent this year, compared with a 19
percent climb for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  GM created the Volt to help add a green sheen to its image
and compete against Prius.  The Volt, chosen as 2011’s North American Car of the Year,
succeeded in satisfying its customers, with 92 percent of survey
respondents telling  Consumer Reports  they would buy one again.  Even with the accolades, the car struggled to garner the
kinds of sales sought by Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson,
who had forecast global Volt sales of 60,000 in 2012, before
settling for about half that amount.  In late April, Akerson said GM was working to cut the price
of producing the Volt by as much as $10,000 each without
removing features for the next-generation version which he
indicated could come out in 2015 or 2016.  “We know we have to reduce costs,” Akerson said during an
interview in April. “We’ve got to look at smart ways at getting
it better positioned from a price perspective and that means
we’ve got to take cost out of it.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
