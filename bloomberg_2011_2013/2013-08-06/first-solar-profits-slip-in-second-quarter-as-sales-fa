First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest U.S.
solar-panel manufacturer, reported lower second-quarter profit
as sales slipped 46 percent. The shares slumped in late U.S.
trading.  Net income fell to $33.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from
$111 million, or $1.27, a year earlier, Tempe, Arizona-based
First Solar said today in a statement. Excluding one-time items,
per-share profit was 14 cents below the 53-cent average of 16
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales declined to
$519.8 million from $957.3 million.  The company expects earnings of $3.75 to $4.25 a share this
year, down from a May forecast of $4 to $4.50. Sales will be
$3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. The shares declined 8.3 percent to
$42.85 at 4:40 p.m. in New York, after the close of regular U.S.
trading.  “It was a miss, clearly,” Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at
Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston, said today in an
interview. “They missed our estimate pretty badly. It was
really a top line miss.”  Chief Executive Officer Jim Hughes is seeking buyers for
new power plants First Solar will build with its panels to
replace the large projects it’s contracted to complete by 2015.
The company isn’t signing enough new deals to keep its pipeline
filled, said Dan Ries, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC in New
York.  “We do not believe they are booking new business for late
2015 and 2016 at the pace needed to remain fully utilized,”
Ries said yesterday in a note to clients. He estimated First
Solar needs to sign contracts for at least 500 megawatts each
quarter to keep factories running at capacity. “Thus far in
2013 it has not approached that pace.”  Power Plants  First Solar sold the 139-megawatt Campo Verde project in
 California  in April and won approval in June to begin
construction on a 50-megawatt plant in New Mexico that will
deliver power to El Paso Electric Co. for 20 years.  First Solar has anticipated sales of $3.8 billion to $4
billion this year as it recognizes revenue from the 550-megawatt
 Desert Sunlight  project it’s expected to complete in Southern
California in 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
