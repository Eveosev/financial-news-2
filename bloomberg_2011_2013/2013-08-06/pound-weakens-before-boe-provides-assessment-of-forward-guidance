The pound weakened for the first time
in four days against the euro before the Bank of England
presents a review tomorrow of implementing forward guidance in
its quarterly Inflation Report.  Sterling dropped from the strongest in a week versus the
single currency even after data showed Britain’s industrial
production rose more in June than economists forecast. Central
Bank Governor Mark Carney will present the central bank’s
assessment of the use of thresholds and interest-rate guidance
in the Inflation Report as requested by the government.  Five-year gilts  dropped for a sixth day as the Debt Management Office
sold 4.5 billion pounds ($6.91 billion) of the securities.  “Going into the Inflation Report, we favor being
positioned bearish on the pound,” said Michael Sneyd, a
currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in  London . “Not only are
they likely to implement forward guidance, they are also likely
to implement thresholds or give a positive spin on their
assessment of thresholds in such a way to suggest that they
could be introducing” them in the future, he said.  The U.K. currency weakened 0.3 percent to 86.56 pence per
euro at 4:45 p.m. London time after appreciating to 86.19 pence,
the strongest level since July 26. The pound was little changed
at $1.5373 after rising to $1.5392, the highest since July 29.  There’s a 68 percent probability sterling will weaken to
its 2013 low of 88.151 pence per euro by year-end, according to
an FX Rate Forecast model based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Not Warranted’  Carney has already taken steps to curb higher borrowing
costs, saying at the central bank’s policy meeting last month
that the “implied rise in the expected future path of bank rate
was not warranted” by economic developments. He introduced
forward guidance in April 2009 when he was governor of the Bank
of  Canada .  He will align Bank of England policy closer to the Federal
Reserve’s by linking guidance on interest rates to economic
developments, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 43
economists published last month. Twenty-three said the governor
will opt to link a pledge on loose policy to economic data,
while 18 said he will use a period of time.  “Caution of a surprise by Carney has prevented sterling
from benefiting from the improved economic data and the modest
backing up of interest rates,” analysts at Brothers Harriman &
Co. led by Global Head of Currency Strategy Marc Chandler in New
York, wrote in a note to clients. “Barring a significant
surprise from Carney, we suspect sterling could trade higher;
recover further against the euro, where the ECB is likely to
keep rates low for longer.”  Sterling may test its July high near $1.5435, they wrote.  Pound’s Decline  The pound has weakened 1.5 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro rose 5.9 percent and the dollar
gained 5 percent.  The five-year gilt yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.40 percent after climbing to 1.43
percent, the highest level since July 8. The 1.25 percent
security due in July 2018 fell 0.09, or 90 pence per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 99.28.  The 10-year yield was little changed at 2.48 percent.  The Debt Management Office sold additional five-year gilts
at an average yield of 1.405 percent, compared with 1.422
percent at the previous auction on June 20 and a record-low
0.787 percent set at a sale in November.  Gilts lost investors 3.5 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries
dropped 2.8 percent and German bonds declined 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
