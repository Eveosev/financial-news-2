(Corrects profit figures in first and second paragraphs.)  Natixis SA (KN) , the investment-banking
and asset-management unit of  France ’s second-largest lender by
branches, reported a 29 percent decline in second-quarter profit
after booking an accounting charge tied to its own debt.  Net income on a pro-forma basis dropped to 248 million
euros ($330 million) from 349 million euros a year earlier, the
Paris-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today. The bank
took a 20 million-euro charge on its debt, after booking a 91
million-euro gain in the year-earlier period.  The pro-forma figures exclude costs related to the decision
to sell back its holdings in French regional banks Banques
Populaires and Caisses d’Epargne, Natixis’s parents.  Natixis, whose common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 9.7
percent at the end of June, will make a 2 billion-euro
exceptional dividend payment to shareholders on Aug. 19 after
completing the sale of the holdings today. The bank announced
the planned payout in February.  Revenue at the savings unit, which includes asset
management, insurance and private banking, rose 13 percent, it
said. While pretax profit at Natixis’s savings division rose 15
percent in the second quarter, corporate- and investment-banking
pretax earnings fell 6 percent, hurt by lower capital-markets
revenue, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
