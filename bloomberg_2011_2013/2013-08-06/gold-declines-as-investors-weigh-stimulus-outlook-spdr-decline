Gold futures tumbled, capping the
longest slump in 11 weeks, on speculation that the  Federal
Reserve  will scale back U.S. bond purchases.  Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans , who has backed
monetary stimulus, said today that the labor market showed
“good improvement.” He indicated a cut in debt purchases may
begin in September. In July, gold rose 7.3 percent, the most
since January 2012, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that
it’s too early to decide whether to pare asset buying next
month.  “The downward pressure in gold is testament to the belief
that tapering is likely to start sooner rather than later,”
Carlos Perez-Santalla, a New York-based broker at Marex North
America LLC, said in a telephone interview. “The mood is very
bearish.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 1.5 percent to
settle at $1,282.50 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest drop for a most-active contract since July 5.
Earlier, the price touched $1,278.10, the lowest since July 18.
The commodity declined for the sixth straight session, the
longest slump since mid-May.  Futures have fallen 23 percent this year as some investors
lost faith in gold as a store of value amid an equity rally and
low inflation.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded product backed by the metal, have slumped 32 percent in
2013 to the lowest since February 2009.  Silver futures for September delivery declined 1 percent to
$19.523 an ounce on the Comex, the biggest drop since July 26.
Trading was 28 percent below the average in the past 100 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price has tumbled
35 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery dropped 1.4 percent to $1,427.80 an ounce, the
biggest decline since July 26.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell 1.7 percent
to $722.80 an ounce, the lowest settlement since July 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
