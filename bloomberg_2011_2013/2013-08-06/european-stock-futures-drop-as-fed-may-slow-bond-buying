European stocks  declined as comments
from Federal Reserve policy makers fueled speculation the
central bank will begin tapering stimulus next month, and as
companies from Salzgitter AG to Lanxess AG cut profit forecasts.  Salzgitter,  Germany ’s second-largest steelmaker, tumbled 12
percent after saying it expects a pretax loss of about 400
million euros ($530 million) this year. Lanxess lost 4.3 percent
after saying it sees no increase in demand in the second half.
InterContinental Hotels Group Plc rose 6.4 percent after posting
an increase in first-half profit.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index lost 0.4 percent to 303.5 at the
close of trading. The benchmark gauge erased earlier gains of as
much as 0.4 percent as Fed Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said in an interview with Market News International
that if economic growth and  job creation  pick up as expected,
the central bank should proceed with the “removal” of its
asset purchases, and as investors awaited remarks from Fed Bank
of Chicago President  Charles Evans .  “It looks like markets on both side of the pond are
nervous ahead of Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans,
who is due to talk later,” Stephane Ekolo, a strategist at Kyte
Group Ltd. in London, wrote in an e-mail. “Taper talk was at
the origin of the selloff, with Fed President Lockhart cited as
saying it could start curtailing its bond-buying program at any
of three remaining FOMC meetings.”  The Stoxx 600 added 1.8 percent  last week  as European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said  interest rates  in the
euro zone will remain low for an extended period.  Fisher Comments  Fed Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher , one of the
most vocal critics of quantitative easing, yesterday warned
investors not to rely on stimulus.  “Financial markets may have become too accustomed to what
some have depicted as a Fed put,” or the idea that the central
bank will loosen credit after a market decline, Fisher said
yesterday in a speech in  Portland ,  Oregon .  National benchmark indexes retreated in 14 of the 18
western-European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 0.2
percent, Germany’s DAX fell 1.2 percent and France’s CAC 40
slipped 0.4 percent.  Salzgitter tumbled 12 percent to 25.27 euros, its biggest
decline since March 2009. The steelmaker expects a pretax loss
of about 400 million euros this year amid a slump in demand due
to the deterioration of the European economy. “The ongoing
recession in many European countries has put pressure on the
European  steel industry  in the form of a structural crisis,” it
said yesterday after the close of regular trading.  Lanxess Forecast  Lanxess retreated 4.3 percent to 44.48 euros after it cut
its profit forecast for 2014 and predicted no recovery in
second-half demand. The Cologne, Germany-based company said it
won’t achieve its Ebitda target for next year of 1.4 billion
euros. It forecast earnings for this year of 700 million euros
to 800 million euros.  Munich Re (MUV2) , the world’s biggest reinsurer, dropped 4.9
percent to 145.25 euros after it said second-quarter profit fell
35 percent, missing analysts’ estimates, as claims arising from
natural disasters rose. Net income dropped to 529 million euros
from 808 million euros a year earlier, trailing the 557.1
million-euro average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , a gold miner in Africa, declined
5.6 percent to 4,428 pence. Fresnillo Plc, the world’s biggest
primary silver producer, sank 11 percent to 924.5 pence after
cutting its interim dividend by 68 percent from a year earlier
because of a slump in precious-metal prices.  A gauge of commodity producers fell the most among the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600.  InterContinental Gains  InterContinental Hotels  rose 6.4 percent to 2,030 pence
after the world’s largest provider of hotel rooms reported
first-half net income of $340 million, compared with $271
million a year earlier.  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  added 2.2 percent to 4.26 euros. Italy’s
biggest bank said second-quarter  net income  climbed to 361
million euros from 169 million euros a year earlier. That was in
line with the 360 million-euro average estimate of eight
 analysts surveyed  by Bloomberg. The Milan-based bank posted a
254 million-euro return from the buyback of 4.2 billion euros of
senior securities in April, according to a statement today.  Royal DSM NV (DSM)  gained 6.4 percent to 56.02 euros. The Dutch
chemical company posted second-quarter profit that beat analyst
estimates after a $3.1 billion-acquisition spree and as it cut
costs. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization jumped 19 percent to 345 million euros. That
exceeded the 333 million-euro average estimate of 11 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
