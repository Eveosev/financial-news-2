Britain’s economic growth  accelerated
in three months through July as  consumer spending  strengthened,
according to an estimate from the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research.  Gross domestic product  rose 0.7 percent compared with a 0.6
percent gain in the second quarter, the London-based institute,
whose clients include the  Bank of England  and the U.K. Treasury,
said in a statement today. Niesr repeated its forecast that it
doesn’t expect GDP to reach its peak of early 2008 until 2015.  The acceleration suggests “a narrowing of the U.K.’s large
negative output gap,” the institute said. “Consumer spending
growth has underpinned the recent gains in economic momentum, in
spite of the continued decline of real consumer wages.”  The estimate follows data today showing that  industrial
production  rose 1.1 percent in June as factory output surged the
most in a year. Reports in the past week showed that
manufacturing, construction and  services  all strengthened in
July. Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  will tomorrow present
the central bank’s new economic forecasts as well as an
assessment on using forward guidance as a policy tool.  To contact the reporter on this story:
