Interpublic Group of Cos. , the
second-largest U.S. advertising company, won dismissal of a suit
by a former executive demanding $381 million for his alleged
role in company’s gains from the sale of  Facebook Inc. (FB)  stock.  New York state Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten threw
out the suit in a ruling dated Aug. 2 and made public yesterday,
saying any oral contract between the executive, Ray Volpe, and
Interpublic granting him profits over the sale of the Facebook
investment was superseded by Volpe’s final employment agreement.  Volpe, who served as first commissioner of the LPGA women’s
professional golf tour from 1975 to 1982, accused Interpublic in
a suit filed in July 2012 of refusing to compensate him even
though he had “sourced and procured” the Facebook investment.  Volpe claimed that he brought Interpublic the opportunity
to invest and form a strategic alliance with Facebook in early
2006. The advertising company invested $2.5 million in Facebook
in June 2006, taking a stake of about 0.5 percent in the
company’s capital stock on a fully diluted basis, according to
the suit.  Interpublic sold half of its stake on the secondary market
for $133.5 million in August 2011 then sold its remaining shares
for about $249 million in connection with Facebook’s initial
public offering in May, according to the suit.  Neal Brickman, an attorney representing Volpe, didn’t
immediately return a telephone message left at his office
seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Volpe v. Interpublic Group of Cos.,
652308/2012,  New York  state Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
