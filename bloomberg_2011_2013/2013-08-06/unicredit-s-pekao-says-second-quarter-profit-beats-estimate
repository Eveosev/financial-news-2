Bank Pekao SA, Poland’s second-largest bank and a unit of  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , said second-quarter
profit rose 5.3 percent as declining costs helped offset lower
revenue.  Net income increased to 741.8 million zloty ($233 million)
from 704.2 million zloty a year earlier, the Warsaw-based bank
said in a regulatory statement today. That exceeded the 647.8
million zloty average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Polish banks are trying to keep costs under control as
revenue is pressured by record low interest rates and weak
economic growth in the eastern European country. Still, they are
starting to benefit from a decision by the financial market
regulator to ease credit restrictions.  Pekao cut operating costs by 2.9 percent to 902.8 million
zloty and increased retail lending by 3.8 percent in the first
six months of this year compared to December.  Second-quarter net interest income, the difference between
what the bank pays on deposits and what it charges for loans,
fell 7.6 percent from a year earlier to 1.1 billion zloty. Fee
income declined 1 percent to 573.4 million zloty.  Pekao shares climbed 1.6 percent to 167.5 zloty yesterday.
The share is flat this year compared with an 11 percent increase
for the main  Polish banking index  and a 6.9 percent decline for
the benchmark  WIG20 index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
