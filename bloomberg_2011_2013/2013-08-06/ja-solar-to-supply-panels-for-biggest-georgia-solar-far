JA Solar Holdings Co. (JASO) , the biggest
photovoltaic-cell provider by capacity, will provide 38.6
megawatts of panels for Georgia’s largest solar farm.  Phoenix Solar AG (PS4)  is building the Simon Solar Farm for
developer Silicon Ranch Corp. about 30 miles (48 kilometers)
east of Atlanta, Shanghai-based JA Solar said today in a
statement. It’s expected to be complete by year-end and Southern
Co.’s Georgia Power utility unit will buy the electricity under
a 20-year contract.  JA Solar American depositary receipts, each worth five
ordinary shares, rose 2.4 percent to $8.96 at 10:03 a.m. in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
