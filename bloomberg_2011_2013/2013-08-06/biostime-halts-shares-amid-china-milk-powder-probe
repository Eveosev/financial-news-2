Biostime International Holdings Ltd. (1112) 
halted trading of its shares pending the results of a probe by
 China ’s top economic planning agency into milk-powder pricing
that could come as early as today.  The company received notice that the results of the
 National Development and Reform Commission’s  investigation would
be released today or tomorrow and is preparing for the
announcement, Jason Xu, Biostime’s assistant chief financial
officer, said in a telephone interview today.  The probe into infant-formula makers for possible
monopolistic practices, announced last month, has already
prompted companies including  Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) , Danone
and  Nestle SA (NESN)  to cut prices for their products. Some companies
have broadly admitted that their resale prices may have broke
rules, the official Xinhua News Agency has reported, citing Xu
Kunlin, head of the NDRC’s pricing supervision department. It
didn’t say which producers admitted violations.  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  and Royal FrieslandCampina NV were the
others being probed on pricing. The overseas manufacturers set a
minimum at which their products could be sold in China, leading
to high prices, Xinhua reported July 31.  A July 2 article in the Communist Party’s official People’s
Daily newspaper said the NDRC had evidence showing prices for
foreign milk powder producers had increased about 30 percent
since 2008, the same year milk powder contaminated with the
chemical melamine killed at least six infants.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
