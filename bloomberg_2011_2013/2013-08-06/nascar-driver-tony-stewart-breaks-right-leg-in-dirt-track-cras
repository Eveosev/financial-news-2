Three-time Nascar Sprint Cup Series
champion Tony Stewart broke two bones in his lower right leg
when he crashed during a dirt track race in Oskaloosa,  Iowa .  Stewart, 42, underwent surgery yesterday after breaking his
right tibia and fibula, and will be replaced by another driver
from the Stewart-Haas racing team in this week’s Nascar Sprint
Cup event in Watkins Glen, New York.  Stewart’s injuries come less than two months after former
Nascar driver Jason Leffler died in a dirt track crash in
Swedesboro,  New Jersey . While Stewart is a team owner and one of
the top drivers on Nascar’s top tier, he schedules about 70
short track events each year, according to  Nascar’s website .  Stewart was leading last night’s winged car sprint event in
 Oskaloosa  with five laps remaining when another car lost control
and caused Stewart’s car to flip. Stewart had also been involved
in a 15-car pileup in a short track race on July 16 in
Canandaigua,  New York , and flipped his car five times in another
dirt track event on July 29 in Ontario,  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
