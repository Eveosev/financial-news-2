Live Nation Entertainment Inc. (LYV) , the
largest concert promoter and ticket seller, jumped in extended
trading after reporting second-quarter profit that beat
analystsâ€™ estimates on increased concert sales.  The shares rose 6.2 percent to $17.33 at 4:55 p.m.  New York 
time, after slipping 1.9 percent to $16.32 at the close.  Adjusted operating income rose 9.5 percent to $159.9
million, from a year earlier, the Beverly Hills, California-based company said in a statement today. Analysts on average had
estimated $146.8 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company has sought to boost revenue and extract more
profit from its ticketing division as well as minimizing loss-making concerts. Revenue from concerts rose 11 percent while
ticketing sales rose 2.7 percent.  Net income for the quarter ended in June rose to $58.1
million, or 30 cents a share, from $7.69 million, or 4 cents, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.68 billion from $1.55 billion,
ahead of the $1.63 billion average estimate of analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
