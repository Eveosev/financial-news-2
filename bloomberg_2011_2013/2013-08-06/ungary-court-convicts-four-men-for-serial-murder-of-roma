A Hungarian court convicted four
people in one of the country’s worst racially-motivated attacks
since World War II, in which six ethnic Roma were killed.  Three men were sentenced to life without parole for murder
in a first-instance ruling, Judge Laszlo Miszori of a Budapest
court said today. A fourth person was sentenced to 13 years in
prison, the judge said. The verdict is subject to appeal.  A five year-old boy and his father were among the victims
after killers shot them as they were escaping their house, set
ablaze by Molotov cocktails in a series of harrowing attacks in
2008 and 2009 that terrorized the Roma community in  Hungary . The
crimes took place in rural areas, several of them during the
night as families were asleep and forced to escape burning homes
before the murderers shot them with rifles.  The four perpetrators denied the charges and their lawyers
pled for their acquittal, according to state news agency MTI.  The murders focused attention on the racism against Roma,
or Gypsies, Hungary’s largest minority and many of whom live in
impoverished conditions.  The radical nationalist Jobbik party became the second-largest parliamentary group in 2010 after campaigning against
what it billed as “Roma crime” as inter-ethnic tensions
escalated.  A team of 120 police officers had hunted the perpetrators
before arresting the suspects in August 2009. Police said the
killers had been planning three other attacks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
