BP Plc (BP/)  stemmed the pace of decline at
its Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oilfield in the Caspian Sea after
Azerbaijan blamed the U.K. company for a slump in output at the
nation’s largest deposit last year.  The field, known as ACG, delivered 16.4 million metric tons
of oil in the first half of 2013, down 2.4 percent from a year
earlier, BP’s office in Baku said today by e-mail. That compares
with a 12 percent drop a year earlier.  The company replaced regional managers and brought in
advisers from around the world to pare the decline in production
at ACG after Azeri President Ilham Aliyev accused the London-based company of “grave mistakes” at the field.  ACG accounted for 77 percent of the country’s oil output
last year. Partners in the project include State Oil Co. of
Azerbaijan, or Socar, Exxon Mobil Corp.,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Statoil
ASA (STL) ,  Itochu Corp. (8001) , Turkiye Petrolleri AO and ONGC Videsh Ltd.  BP also said today that the Shah Deniz natural-gas field in
Azerbaijan pumped 4.8 billion cubic meters of gas in the first
half of the year, up from 3.36 billion cubic meters a year
earlier. Azerbaijan exports gas to Turkey, Russia and  Georgia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
