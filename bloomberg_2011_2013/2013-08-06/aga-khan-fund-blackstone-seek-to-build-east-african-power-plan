The Aga Khan Fund for Economic
Development SA said it has joined with  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  to
bid for construction of a 147-megawatt hydro power plant to be
shared by  Rwanda , Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Industrial Promotion Services Kenya Ltd., an affiliate of
the Aga Khan Fund, and Blackstone through its Sithe Global Power
LLP unit are in talks with the three governments, Kevin Kariuki,
head of infrastructure at IPS, said yesterday near Jinja, 50
miles east of the Ugandan capital, Kampala.  The $600 million project is planned to be situated on the
Ruzizi River at the intersection of the borders of the three
countries. Sithe and IPS jointly own Ugandaâ€™s $900 million, 250-megawatt Bujagali hydropower plant, which reached full capacity
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
