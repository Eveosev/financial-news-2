Oil & Gas Development Co.,  Pakistan ’s
biggest energy explorer, reported its first decline in full-year
profit in five years, after it spent more on prospecting.  Net income fell to 90.8 billion rupees ($889 million), or
21.11 rupees a share, in the 12 months ended June 30 from 96.9
billion rupees, or 22.53 rupees, a year earlier, the Islamabad-based company said in a filing today. The mean of five analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg was a profit of 107.8 billion
rupees. Sales rose to 223.4 billion rupees, compared with 197.8
billion rupees a year earlier.  The company spent 15 billion rupees on exploration and
prospecting, compared with 4 billion rupees last year, according
to the statement. Taxation also increased to 55 billion rupees
from 36.2 billion rupees, lowering profit.  “It’s a disappointing result,” Sana Abdullah, head of
research at Global Securities Pakistan Ltd., said after the
announcement. “The exploration expenses and  tax rate  were both
too high.”  Oil & Gas Development’s  shares , which have the greatest
weight on the benchmark KSE 100 index, fell as much as 2.8
percent to 238 rupees as of 1:17 p.m. in Karachi. They’ve gained
24.6 percent this year, compared with a 35.3 percent rise in the
KSE 100. The company will pay a cash dividend of 2.75 rupees a
share for the year ended June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
