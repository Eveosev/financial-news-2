Russia’s five-year government notes
rose for a third day, widening the discount to 14-year bonds, as
Morgan Stanley said medium-term bonds will probably benefit more
from interest-rate cuts that may start next month.  The yield on OFZ bonds due March 2018 declined seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 6.43 percent, while the
yield on benchmark OFZ bonds due February 2027 rose three basis
points to 7.74 percent. The spread between the two bonds widened
to 131 basis points, four points below a July 30 record.  Bank Rossii will consider borrowing costs on Aug. 9 after
leaving the main lending rates unchanged for a 10 month in July
as inflation was above the 5 percent to 6 percent inflation
target. Slowing inflation and a drop in a manufacturing gauge
signals Bank Rossii may pursue further monetary easing, with a
rate cut in September, Morgan Stanley said in a research note,
with OFZs as its top pick among emerging-market local bonds.  “Though positioning by benchmarked investors is slightly
overweight, it is likely concentrated in the long end of the
curve, which should allow the front end and belly of the bond
curve to outperform,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by Rashique Rahman said the note.  Inflation slowed to 6.5 percent in July from 6.9 percent in
June, the Federal Statistics Service said yesterday. The
manufacturing PMI dropped to 49.2 for July, HSBC Holdings Plc
said Aug. 1, citing data compiled by  Markit Economics . A reading
below 50 shows contraction.  New Auction  While policy makers including Chairman  Elvira Nabiullina 
refrained from cutting the main lending rates in July, they
introduced a one-year, floating-rate auction facility with non-marketable assets as collateral to ease the situation with
liquidity.  Bank Rossii will cut the refinancing rate, currently at
8.25 percent, by at least 25 basis points in the third quarter,
according to 15 out of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent to 37.8042 against Bank
Rossii’s dollar-euro basket by 6 p.m. in Moscow, when the
central banks stops its trading operations. The Russian currency
was little changed against the dollar at 32.9200.  Brent crude 
fell for the third day, losing 0.9 percent by 6:23 p.m. in
Moscow to $107.76 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
