Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH) ,
a provider of consulting and outsourcing services, rose to the
highest price in more than three months after its quarterly
results topped estimates and the company raised its forecasts.  Second-quarter earnings were 99 cents a share last quarter,
the Teaneck, New Jersey-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts had estimated 97 cents on average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 20 percent to $2.16 billion in
the period, compared with the $2.13 billion predicted.  Cognizant cited broad-based growth across industries and
regions, and said it was benefiting from an economy that pushes
customers to seek greater efficiency. The company relies on a
global workforce, including employees in lower-cost countries
such as  India , to provide outsourcing help and other services.  “Economic pressures and long-term secular industry shifts
have been driving fundamental changes in client demands,”
President Gordon Coburn said in the statement.  The shares rose 0.8 percent to $74.01 at the close in  New
York  and are little changed this year.  The company raised its annual earnings forecast to at least
$3.96 a share, from $3.95. Sales will be at least $8.74 billion,
up from a previous forecast of $8.6 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
