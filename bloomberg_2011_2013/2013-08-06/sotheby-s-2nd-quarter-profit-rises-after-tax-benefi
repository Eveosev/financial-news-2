Sotheby’s (BID)  said second-quarter profit
rose 7 percent, thanks primarily to a net income tax benefit
recognized by the New York auctioneer.  Sotheby’s reported a profit of $91.7 million, or $1.33 a
share, up from a year-ago profit of $85.4 million, or $1.24 a
share. Revenue was little changed, at $304.9 million.  Profit per share fell short of the $1.37 average estimate
of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The auctioneer benefited
from a $6.8 million tax benefit in the second quarter, it said
in a release. Expenses rose 2 percent to $171.6 million.  “Our business and the market for quality art at the high
end continue to be strong,” said William Ruprecht, chairman and
chief executive officer, in a statement.  Sotheby’s shares are up about 34 percent this year. Today,
they fell 23 cents to $44.91 in New York Stock Exchange trading.  To contact the reporter of this story:
