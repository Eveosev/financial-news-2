U.S. consumer spending on home
entertainment dropped in the second quarter as outlays on
digital-media purchases failed to counter shrinking DVD sales,
 Digital Entertainment Group  said.  Total spending on at-home entertainment fell 1.4 percent to
$3.94 billion, from almost $4 billion a year earlier, the
Hollywood-backed company said in a statement today. Viewers
increased their spending 2 percent to $8.63 billion during the
first half of 2013.  Hollywood studios are looking to digital-viewing methods
such as the Internet-streaming services offered by  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) 
and Hulu LLC to bolster falling DVD sales and rental services.
Digital sales, which include video on demand, as well as Web-delivered content, rose 22 percent to $1.51 billion during the
quarter.  Spending on packaged goods, such as DVDs, dropped 13
percent and rental sales excluding video on demand declined more
than 10 percent. Spending on content watched via streaming and
discs increased 15 percent to $1.04 billion. Consumers cut their
spending on physical subscription services by 19 percent, while
they spent 35 percent more for Web-only streaming.  Blu-ray disc sales grew 15 percent in the first half of
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
