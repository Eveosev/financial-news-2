Unum Group (UNM) , the largest U.S.
disability insurer, fell the most since April after reporting a
decline in second-quarter sales.  Unum dropped 4.8 percent to $30.79 at 11:35 a.m. in New
York, the  worst performer  in the 81-company Standard & Poor’s
500 Financials Index. Revenue for the period ending June 30,
including investments, slid 0.6 percent to $2.6 billion from a
year earlier, Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Unum said in a
statement yesterday, missing the $2.61 billion  average estimate 
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Against a backdrop where most group insurance peers
demonstrated year-over-year sales growth, UNM’s second-quarter
2013 results clearly bucked that trend,”  John Nadel , an analyst
at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., said today in a note using the
company’s ticker symbol.  Annualized premium income on new sales in the quarter fell
19 percent for Unum’s main U.S. unit and 7.2 percent in the U.K.
from a year earlier, acccording to a regulatory filing today.
Net income rose 1 percent to $218.6 million, or 82 cents a
share, from a year earlier.  Chief Executive Officer Thomas Watjen has said he’s
prepared to limit sales rather than offer products at
unattractive prices.  “While sales growth continues to be a challenge in the
U.S., we remain committed to maintaining the pricing and
underwriting discipline that has served us so well,” Watjen,
59, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
