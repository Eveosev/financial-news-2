YY Inc., (YY)  an operator of entertainment
websites, led a decline in Chinese Internet companies trading in
the U.S. after a three-month rally pushed valuations to the
highest on record.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. fell 0.7 percent to 93.36 in New
York. YY, which jumped 140 percent since early May, fell 4.5
percent, while  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , the country’s
biggest online book retailer, posted the steepest slide in three
weeks.  LightInTheBox Holding Ltd. (LITB) , the first Chinese company to
have an initial public offering in the U.S. this year, jumped
after saying second-quarter earnings will be released Aug. 19.  The CSI Overseas  China  Internet Index has gained 60 percent
since early April as Baidu Inc., China’s most-used search
engine, agreed to buy an application store for $1.9 billion in
July. E-tailer  Vipshop Holdings Ltd. (VIPS)  may become a target for
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as it prepares to go public,
86Research Ltd. said last month. YY traded at 34 times estimated
earnings on July 26, the highest since its November U.S.
offering, while Dangdang traded at 8 times book value, a two-year high.  “We had a strong run, it’s not a surprise that we are
having a correction,” Henry Guo, an analyst at ABR Investment
Strategy LLC., said in a phone interview from San Francisco
yesterday. “Any correction won’t be big. China’s Internet
growth still has great potential. It’s a sector that is easy for
the foreign investors to understand.”  ETF Slips  The  iShares China Large-Cap ETF , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.7 percent to $34.43.
The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  slipped 0.6 percent as retailers
reported results that disappointed investors.  YY, based in  Guangzhou , China, dropped to $42.31, paring
its gain this year to 197 percent. Deutsche Bank AG’s analyst
Alan Hellawell downgraded the shares to hold from buy on Aug. 2
with a target price of $46.  Dangdang slumped 1.4 percent to $10.80 after earlier
falling as much as 6.9 percent. The Beijing-based company may
report a second-quarter loss of 15 cents per American depositary
share on Aug. 16, according to the  average forecast  of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That compares with a loss of 24
cents a year ago.  Mindray Medical International Ltd. (MR) , a medical-device maker,
fell 2.2 percent to $40.93. The company, based in Shenzhen,
China, reported second quarter sales of $307 million, below the
average forecast of $312 million of six analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The American depositary receipts of  Semiconductor
Manufacturing International Corp. (SMI)  gained 2 percent to $4.11, the
highest since July 17. The shares traded 2.8 percent above their
equivalent shares in Hong Kong, narrowing from a premium of 6
percent on Aug. 5, the highest since December 2009.  LightInTheBox Earnings  LightInTheBox surged 5.7 percent to $18.95. More than 2.8
million shares changed hands, almost four times the daily
average over the past three months. The company said it will
report second-quarter earnings after the market closes on Aug.
19. The average forecast of three analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for adjusted earnings of 6 cents per share, compared with 2
cents in the first quarter.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in Hong Kong
retreated 0.8 percent to a one-week low of 9,650.42. The
Shanghai Composite Index rose for a sixth day, gaining 0.5
percent to 2,060.5 after automakers rallied on improving
earnings and Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. recommended power
producers on valuations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
