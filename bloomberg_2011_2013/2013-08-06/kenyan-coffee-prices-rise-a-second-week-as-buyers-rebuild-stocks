Kenyan coffee prices rose for a
second week as buyers rebuilt inventories at the second auction
following a six-week recess.  The average price for all coffee sold gained 16 percent to
$169.92 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $145.93 on July
31, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said today by e-mail from the
capital, where the auctions take place. The benchmark AA grade
climbed 8.3 percent to an average of $274.20 a bag. The number
of bags sold plunged 60 percent.  Kenya  produces arabica coffee, used in specialty beverages.
The beans are exported to nations including  Germany , the U.S.
and  Sweden , according to the Kenya Coffee Producers and Traders
Association.  While sales dropped after “marketing agents asked for
higher prices,” quality was unchanged, Mansukh Shah, a coffee
trader at Nairobi-based Allanwood Ltd., said by phone.  Sales dropped to 5,854 bags worth $1.21 million from 14,785
bags valued at $2.64 million, said the exchange, run by the
 Agriculture Ministry  through the Coffee Board of Kenya, the
regulatory body. Bags on offer came to 17,892, it said.  Following are details of today’s auction in dollars a 50-kilogram bag:  To contact the reporter on this story:
