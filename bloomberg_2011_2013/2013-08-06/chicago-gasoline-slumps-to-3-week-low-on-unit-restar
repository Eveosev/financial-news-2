U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened
for the first time in four days as Phillips 66 carried out
maintenance at its Borger, Texas, refinery.  The  discount for conventional , 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in the region shrank by 0.75 cent to  22 cents a gallon  below
contracts traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 3:57
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  gained 1 cent to a discount of 12.75 cents.  The differentials narrowed as Phillips said it was
performing planned work at its 146,000-barrel-a-day Borger
refinery.  Rich Johnson , a company spokesman based in Houston,
declined to comment on details regarding specific units and
duration of work.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  on the Gulf Coast, based on West
Texas Intermediate, slipped 16 cents to $11.72 a barrel, the
lowest since at least September 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The same spread  based on Light Louisiana Sweet oil  dropped
for a fourth day to $6.32 a barrel, 51 cents lower than
yesterday and the least since July 2.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  on the Gulf Coast slipped 0.12 cent
to a discount of 4 cents a gallon to ULSD futures traded on the
Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
