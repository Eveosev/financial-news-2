Hog futures headed for a fifth
straight increase, the longest rally since March, on signs of
increasing demand for U.S. pork. Cattle also advanced.  Meatpacking plants slaughtered about 365,000 hogs
yesterday, up 2.8 percent from the prior week, according to the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture . Exporters sold 11,000 metric
tons of pork in the week through July 25, up 38 percent from the
prior seven days, USDA data show. Wholesale prices are up 3.4
percent this month through yesterday as boxed pork reached
$1.0456 a pound, the highest since July 9.  “Our domestic demand is stronger than what we thought and
that has pushed” up pork prices,  Don Roose , the president of
U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a
telephone interview.  Hog futures for October settlement advanced 0.9 percent to
86.3 cents a pound at 11:03 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, extending the longest streak since March 26.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1.248 a pound on the CME. On Aug. 2, prices touched $1.241, the
lowest for a most-active contract since July 9.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement added 0.4
percent to $1.5765 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
