Spain ’s benchmark  IBEX 35 (IBEX)  index may
rally if the equities gauge completes a so-called inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, according to a technical analyst at
Commerzbank AG.  An index forms an inverse head-and-shoulders when it traces
three troughs, the middle of which is the lowest. Technical
analysts say the measure will probably rally once it rises above
the so-called neckline that links the peaks between the lows.  The IBEX 35 traced the first shoulder from about July 2011
to February 2012, followed by a head formation that was
completed in January 2013, and the index is now near to
concluding the second shoulder, according to Petra Grafin von Kerssenbrock, a technical analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
The gauge rose 0.1 percent to 8,572 at 12:35 p.m. in  Madrid 
today, extending this year’s advance to 5 percent.  “The IBEX had a good recovery rally during the month of
July and is now approaching the staggered resistance level of
between 8,617 and 8,756,” Von Kerssenbrock wrote in e-mailed
comments. “This is the resistance of the long-term head-and-shoulder bottom pattern. While in the short term a consolidation
should be on the technical agenda, with the achieved levels
being defended in the medium-term a breakout to the upside
should not come as a surprise.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
