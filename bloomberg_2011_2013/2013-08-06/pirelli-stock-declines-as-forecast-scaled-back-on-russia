Pirelli SpA (PC) ,  Europe ’s third-largest
tiremaker, fell the most in almost four months after cutting its
profit target for this year because of a weaker Russian market.  Pirelli  dropped  as much as 4.4 percent to 9.58 euros, the
steepest decline since April 8, and was trading down 3.3 percent
at 11:02 a.m. in Milan. Volume was 93 percent of the three-month
daily average. The stock has gained 12 percent this year,
valuing the company at 4.69 billion euros ($6.22 billion).  Earnings before interest and taxes in 2013 will reach 810
million euros, the lower end of a previously forecast range of
810 million to 850 million euros, the Milan-based manufacturer
said in a statement yesterday. The economy and “market
dynamics” are weighing on earnings, with the Ebit margin at the
Russian business now  seen  as “slightly negative” versus an
earlier prediction of “mid-single-digit growth.”  The maker of high-performance tires also narrowed its
global revenue forecast to 6.3 billion to 6.35 billion euros
from an earlier expectation of as much as 6.4 billion euros.  The forecast is a “clear disappointment” amid Pirelli’s
prediction that the benefit of lower raw-material costs will be
consumed by higher spending on opening factories in  Mexico  and
 Russia  and on marketing, Gaetan Toulemonde, a Paris-based
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG with a hold recommendation on the
stock, wrote in a report to investors today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
