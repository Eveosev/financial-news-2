Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC) , a technology
consultant for governments and companies, gained the most in
more than six months after forecasting earnings that were higher
than analysts had estimated.  CSC shares rose 8.5 percent to $54.20 at the close in New
York for the biggest one-day jump since Feb. 5. That brought the
stock’s gain this year to 35 percent.  Earnings from continuing operations for the fiscal year,
which ends in March, will be $3.50 per share to $3.70 per share,
the  Falls Church , Virginia-based company said in a statement.
That compares with the $3.52 average estimate of analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings from continuing operations for
the period ended June 28 were 91 cents, compared with 10 cents
in the year-earlier period.  The company is cutting costs and striking partnerships to
increase earnings under Chief Executive Officer Mike Lawrie. He
has been moving away from traditional infrastructure sales and
focusing instead on software and services.  “We are encouraged with the pace of our turnaround,”
Lawrie said in the statement. “The company is beginning to
pivot more towards growth and we are investing in offerings and
partnerships that will enhance our differentiation and expand
our market coverage.”  CSC signed a deal for a partnership with AT&T Inc., the
largest U.S. phone company, to develop services such as cloud
computing for corporate clients, according to a separate
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
