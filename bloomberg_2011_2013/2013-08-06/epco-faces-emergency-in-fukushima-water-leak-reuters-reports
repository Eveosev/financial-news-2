Groundwater laced with radiation that
is leaking into the  Pacific Ocean  from Japan’s wrecked Fukushima
atomic plant is creating an emergency, according to the
country’s nuclear regulator, cited by Reuters.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501) , the operator of the plant north
of the capital, has taken temporary measures to deal with the
leaks yet doesn’t seem to grasp the scale of the crisis, Reuters
reported, citing Shinji Kinjo, who leads a  task force  for the
Nuclear Regulatory Authority, known as the NRA.  Kinjo was not available to comment today, the NRA said
after three phone calls.  Two weeks ago, the utility known as Tepco said radiated
water had been flowing into the sea at Fukushima, backtracking
on previous comments that said it couldn’t be confirmed. The
delay earned a rebuke from the government and academics.  Tepco’s announcement on July 22 angered unions that lost
access to  fishing areas  and customers on concern radiation would
contaminate catches and enter the food chain. In August 2012,
the utility found record high levels of radioactive cesium in
fish it caught for tests within 20 kilometers of the coast from
the nuclear plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
