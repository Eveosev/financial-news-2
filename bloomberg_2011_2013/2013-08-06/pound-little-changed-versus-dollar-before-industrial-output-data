U.K. 10-year bond yields reached the
highest level in a month after a government report showed
Britain’s industrial production increased in June, damping
demand for safer assets.  Five-year gilts fell for a sixth day as the Debt Management
Office sold 4.5 billion pounds ($6.91 billion) of the
securities. Today’s data came after manufacturing and services
reports last week that added to evidence the economic recovery
is gathering pace. The  extra yield  on 10-year bonds instead of
two-year gilts approached the highest since August 2011. The
pound was little changed against the dollar.  “The U.K. recovery is becoming more earnest,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. in Edinburgh. “The long end of the curve, 10-year and
above, is going to struggle because the global economic
environment is slowly, but steadily, improving.”  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield was at 2.47 percent at
1:01 p.m. in  London  after climbing to 2.51 percent, the highest
since July 5. The price of the 1.75 percent bond maturing in
September 2022 was 94.155.  The extra yield on 10-year gilts over two-year securities
widened less than one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
209 basis points after expanding to 211 basis points on Aug. 2,
the widest since Aug. 9, 2011.  U.K.  industrial output  increased 1.1 percent from May after
stagnating for three months, the  Office for National Statistics 
said in London. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast growth
of 0.7 percent.  Gilt Auction  The five-year yield rose two basis points to 1.40 percent
after jumping seven basis points yesterday.  The Debt Management Office sold 1.25 percent securities
maturing July 2018 at an average yield of 1.41 percent, compared
with 1.422 percent when they were last auctioned on June 20 and
a record low of 0.787 percent in November.  Gilts lost investors 3.5 percent this year through
yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes, as signs
global growth is recovering sapped demand for the safer
investments. Treasuries dropped 2.8 percent and German bonds
declined 1.4 percent.  The pound dropped 0.1 percent to $1.5345 after gaining 1.6
percent during the previous two days. Sterling dropped 0.2
percent to 86.51 pence per euro.  ‘Bearish’ Positioning  Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  will detail plans for
forward guidance on  interest rates  in the central bank’s
quarterly Inflation Report due to be released tomorrow.  “Going into the inflation report, we favor being
positioned bearish on the pound,” said Michael Sneyd, a
currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in London. “Not only are
they likely to implement forward guidance, they are also likely
to implement thresholds or give a positive spin on their
assessment of thresholds in such a way to suggest that they
could be introducing” them in the future, he said.  Carney introduced guidance in April 2009 while governor of
the  Bank of Canada  -- pledging to keep  Canada ’s key rate at a
record low until mid-2010.  The pound has weakened 1.5 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes that track 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro rose 5.7 percent and the dollar
gained 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
