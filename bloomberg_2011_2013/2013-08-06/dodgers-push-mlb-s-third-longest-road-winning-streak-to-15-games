The  Los Angeles Dodgers  defeated the
St. Louis Cardinals 3-2 to extend their road winning streak to
15 games, the longest in the National League in 56 years and
tied for the third-longest in Major League Baseball history.  Dodgers pitcher Zack Greinke allowed two runs over 6 1/3
innings at St. Louis’s Busch Stadium to earn his 100th career
victory.  The Dodgers are the first NL team to win 15 consecutive
road games since the 1957 Cincinnati Redlegs. The 1984  Detroit
Tigers  and 1916 New York Giants share the major-league record of
17 road victories in a row.  “We kind of thrive on that us-against-the-stadium type
mentality where we really come together as a ball club,”
Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis told reporters.  The NL West-leading Dodgers have a major league-best 32-7
record since June 21, when they were 30-42.  To contact the reporter on this story:
