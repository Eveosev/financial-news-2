Tofas Turk Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO) 
slumped most in almost seven weeks after the carmaker reported
second-quarter earnings that missed analysts’ estimates.  Tofas fell 5.4 percent to 12.3 liras at the close in
Istanbul, its biggest decline since June 20. The number of
shares traded was 96 percent of the three-month daily average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The  Borsa Istanbul
National 100 (XU100)  index dropped for the first time in four days,
retreating 0.4 percent.  The carmaker co-owned by  Fiat SpA (F)  and Turkey’s  Koc Holding
AS (KCHOL)  posted net income of 109.2 million liras ($57 million) for
the quarter, according to a statement sent to the bourse after
the market closed yesterday. The figure, which missed the
average estimate of 127.6 million liras in a Bloomberg  survey  of
11 analysts, was down 12 percent from the same period last year.
Sales fell an annual 4.8 percent to 1.78 billion liras.  “The results have created disappointment among
investors,” Ozgur Ucur, an analyst at Finans Invest in
Istanbul, said by phone today. “We may see some short-term
pressure on the shares.”  Tofas trades at 12 times estimated 12-month earnings,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with a
multiple of 13 for Istanbul-based  Ford Otomotiv Sanayi AS (FROTO)  and
7.1 for  India ’s  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  Ten analysts recommend buying
Tofas shares, while 16 have hold recommendations and two advise
selling,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  The carmaker’s shares climbed 18 percent this year,
compared with a 5.3 percent slump in the benchmark index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
