The sale of the  Phoenix Coyotes  was
approved by the  National Hockey League ’s board of governors,
terminating the league’s four-year ownership of the franchise.  The Coyotes were officially sold to IceArizona
AcquisitionCo. LLC, a group headed by Canadian businessman
George Gosbee and Anthony LeBlanc, a former  Research in Motion
Ltd. (BB)  executive. The team will remain in Arizona.  “The National Hockey League believes in Arizona as an NHL
market and that these new owners can provide the Coyotes the
opportunity to secure a stable, long-term future in Glendale,”
NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. “We are
extremely pleased that a positive resolution has been achieved
for the fans, the city, the Coyotes and the League.”  Renaissance Sports and Entertainment LLC will act as the
managing partner of IceArizona, the NHL said.  “The Coyotes are here to stay and we will continue to work
hard on and off the ice and have a strong presence in our
community,” LeBlanc said.  The NHL purchased the Coyotes, who missed the playoffs with
a 21-18-9 record last season, in bankruptcy four years ago.
