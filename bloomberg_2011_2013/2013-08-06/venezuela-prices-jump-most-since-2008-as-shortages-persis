Venezuela ’s consumer prices last
month rose at the fastest pace since the index was created in
2008 amid worsening shortages of staple goods such as meat,
sugar and milk.  Prices rose 42.6 percent in July from a year earlier and
3.2 percent in the month, the central bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The median forecast of seven economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a monthly rate of 3.5 percent.  New currency auctions have failed to offset a shortage of
dollars that is fueling the fastest inflation among 103
economies tracked worldwide by Bloomberg. The central bank’s
scarcity index rose to 19.4 in July from 19.3 in June, meaning
that one of every five staple goods is out of stock at any given
time.  The central bank sold about $400 million to importers and
individuals under a new auction system started last month to
damp price pressure. Companies that are unable to access dollars
at the official rate pay five times as much on the black market,
passing the price premium to customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
