U.S. consumers and businesses
installed 175 megawatts of  wind turbines  last year to generate
their own electricity and reduce their dependence on utilities,
according to the U.S. Energy Department.  That was a 62 percent increase over 2011, led by farmers
and schools from  California  to  Wisconsin , the Energy Department
said today in a  report  on the distributed wind industry. Total
investment was more than $410 million.  The surge in turbine installation by power consumers
mirrored the growth in utility-scale wind farms, which almost
doubled last year to 13,000 megawatts making wind the largest
new source of U.S. electricity. The agency defines distributed
wind generation as turbines that are connected either directly
to customers or to local power grids, compared to wholesale
power that utilities deliver through transmission lines.  Most of the turbines installed at customer sites were 100
kilowatts or less and mounted on towers about 30 meters (98
feet) high, according to the report.  The U.S. has more than 60 gigawatts of wind energy capacity
in operation, mostly in Texas, California and Iowa. Thatâ€™s
enough to supply about 14.7 million homes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
