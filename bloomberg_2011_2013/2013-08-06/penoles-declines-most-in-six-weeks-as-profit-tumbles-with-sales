Industrias Penoles SAB, the second-biggest Mexican mining company by market value, fell the most in
six weeks as quarterly revenue and profit dropped.  The  shares  fell 6.8 percent to 413.40 pesos at 1:40 p.m. in
Mexico City, the biggest drop since June 20 on a closing basis.
Penoles was the biggest loser on the IPC index of 35 Mexican
companies, which was little changed.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the London-traded unit that accounts for most of Penoles’s profits, fell 11
percent today, the most on the FTSE 100.  The precious-metals miner’s net income plummeted 46 percent
to 1.2 billion pesos ($95 million) in the second quarter as
sales fell to 17.2 billion pesos. Invex Casa de Bolsa SA had
projected profit of 2.31 billion pesos. Gold for immediate
delivery declined 23 percent in the second quarter, while silver
slid 31 percent.  “Sales were affected by the drop in metals prices, as well
as the reduction in production volume,” Monex Casa de Bolsa SA
analyst Fernando Bolanos said in an e-mailed research note
today. He cut his target price to 400 pesos from 465 pesos,
while keeping his recommendation at sell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
