The United Nations said it welcomes
the release of 14 supporters of former President Laurent Gbagbo
who were arrested after post-election violence in 2010 and 2011.  A judge in Abidjan, the country’s commercial capital,
ordered the prisoners awaiting trial, including Gbagbo’s son,
Michel, be released yesterday. Pascal Affi N’Guessan, the leader
of the former ruling party Front Populaire Ivoirien, was also
freed.  The move will bring “peace between all Ivorian political
actors,” Aichatou Mindaoudou, the special representative of the
United Nations secretary-general in the West African nation,
said in an e-mailed statement. It “is a good sign for a
national dialogue that is truly republican, as part of the
search for lasting reconciliation,” she said.  Gbagbo was arrested in Abidjan in April 2011 after five
months of violence that left about 3,000 people dead and plunged
the world’s largest producer of cocoa into an economic crisis.
More than 100 of Gbagbo’s allies were arrested. Gbagbo is
awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court in The Hague
on charges of crimes against humanity.  The release is “a measure of appeasement to facilitate
reconciliation,” Bruno Kone, a government spokesman said
yesterday. The officials released also include Philippe Henry
Dacoury-Tabley, the former governor of West Africa’s regional
central bank, and former foreign affairs minister Alcide Djedje.  To contact the reporter on this story:
