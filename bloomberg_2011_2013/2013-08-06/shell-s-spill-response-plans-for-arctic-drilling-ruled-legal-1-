Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s oil spill
plans for drilling in Alaska’s Beaufort and Chukchi seas don’t
violate environmental laws, a federal judge in Anchorage ruled
in rejecting a challenge by conservation groups.  The U.S. Interior Department’s approval process wasn’t
flawed or based on erroneous assumptions and the approvals don’t
violate the Endangered Species Act, the  Clean Water Act  or other
environmental laws, U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline ruled
yesterday.  Shell halted operations off the Alaskan coast after
accidents in 2012. Environmental groups including Greenpeace
criticized the plans, saying oil spills above the Arctic circle
would be almost impossible to clean up.  “The first court in the country said these spill plans
were sufficient, but this is only the beginning of the effort to
define the obligations to address oil spill prevention and
response, especially in remote, isolated areas like the Arctic
Ocean,” Holly Harris, an attorney for Earthjustice, a public
interest law organization representing conservation groups that
sued, said yesterday in a phone interview.  Curtis Smith , a spokesman for The Hague-based Shell, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail yesterday seeking comment on 
the ruling.  The cases are Alaska Wilderness League v. Department of
Interior, 12-00010, and Shell Gulf of Mexico v. Center for
Biological Diversity, 12-00048, U.S. District Court, District of
Alaska (Anchorage).  To contact the reporter on this story:
