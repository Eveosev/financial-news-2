The U.S. Northeast and Midwest may
have cooler-than-normal weather through the middle of August,
sapping energy demand, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures across the regions are expected to be 3 to 5
degrees Fahrenheit (1.6 to 2.8 Celsius) below the norm from Aug.
11 to Aug. 20,  Matt Rogers , president of Bethesda, Maryland-based CWG, said today in a note to clients. The sole exception
is likely to be Texas, he said.  “Texas is the only show in town for exceptional heat,”
Rogers said. “Overall, national demand continues to run
considerably lower than the last three years.”  Seasonal to below-normal temperatures in the large cities
of the eastern U.S. and Canada tend to decrease energy
consumption because fewer people turn to air conditioning.  The normal average temperature in New York on Aug. 13 is
about 77 degrees, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Boston it’s 73; Chicago, 73; Dallas,
87;  St. Louis , 79; and  Seattle , 67.  To contact the reporter on this story:
