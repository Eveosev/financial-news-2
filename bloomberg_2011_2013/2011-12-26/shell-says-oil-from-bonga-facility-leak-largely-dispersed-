Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said oil that
leaked from its 200,000 barrel-a-day  Bonga  field in Nigeria
“has largely dispersed” as of last night.  Shell “will continue to monitor the area, including using
radar satellite, and take appropriate steps to disperse any
further persistent oil sheens,” according to a statement on the
website of the Hague-based company’s regional unit.  Oil from an unidentified third-party spill from a vessel in
the area hampered clean-up efforts, Shell said.  An export line from the field’s floating production,
storage and offloading vessel to a tanker was the likely cause
of the spill, estimated at less than 40,000 barrels of crude,
Shell said on Dec. 21. Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Idoho platform
spilled about 40,000 barrels in January 1998.  Bonga, located 75 miles (120 kilometers) off  Nigeria ’s
coastline, pumps about 10 percent of the West African nation’s
oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
