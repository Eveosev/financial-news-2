China’s stocks (SHCOMP)  fell, extending the
longest weekly slide in three years, on a jump in money market
rates and media reports the government will cut railway
construction spending and maintain property curbs next year.  CSR Corp. (601766)  and  China  Railway Construction Corp. led declines
for train-related companies after the Xinhua News Agency said
the railway ministry will reduce spending by 15 percent in 2012.
China Minsheng Banking Corp. slid 1.8 percent, pacing a slump
for lenders, after the money market rate surged to a five-week
high.  Inner Mongolian Baotou Steel Union Co. (600010)  surged the most in
six months after China Investment Securities Co. said shares of
steelmakers are the cheapest in three years.  “The economy is still slowing and liquidity is tight at
the year-end,” said  Zhang Ling , general manager at  Shanghai 
River Fund Management Co. “Both factors are contributing to the
weakness in the market these days. If the slowdown worsens, the
government may introduce more aggressive measures to support the
economy such as tax cuts.”  The Shanghai Composite Index slid 14.67 points, or 0.7
percent, to 2,190.11 at the close. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  lost 1
percent to 2,335.70. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added
0.9 percent at the close in  New York  on Dec. 23. Markets from
 Hong Kong  to Singapore, the U.K. and the U.S. are closed today.  The Shanghai Composite dropped for a seventh week last
week, the longest losing streak since the five days ended Sept.
19, 2008. The measure trades at a record low of 10.5 times
estimated earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg
dating back to 2006. For the year, the measure is down 22
percent after the central bank raised  interest rates  three times
to cool inflation and exports to  Europe  slowed because of the
region’s debt crisis.  Railway Investment  CSR, the biggest Chinese train maker, slumped 7.3 percent
to 4.42 yuan.  China CNR Corp. (601299) , the second largest, lost 4.3
percent to 4.28 yuan. China Railway, builder of more than half
the nation’s rail links since 1949, slid 1 percent to 3.99 yuan.  The railway ministry will invest 400 billion yuan ($63.2
billion) in rail infrastructure construction next year, the
official Xinhua reported on Dec. 23, citing minister Sheng Guangzu. Spending was estimated at 469 billion yuan in 2011 and
709 billion yuan in 2010, according to the China Daily.  China set a growth target of about 11 percent for
industrial output next year, China National Radio reported
today, citing Miao Wei, minister of Industry and Information
Technology. Industrial production grew 12.4 percent in November.  Tight Liquidity  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, jumped 43 basis points, or
0.43 percentage point, to 4.16 percent in Shanghai, according to
a weighted average compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center. That’s set for the highest level since Nov. 23.  Minsheng Banking., the nation’s first privately owned bank,
lost 1.8 percent to 5.89 yuan.  Industrial Bank Co. (601166) , part-owned
by a unit of HSBC Holdings Plc, fell 1 percent to 12.39 yuan.
China Construction Bank Corp., the second-biggest lender,
retreated 0.4 percent to 4.54 yuan.  The People’s Bank of China lowered the lenders’ reserve
requirement ratio for the first time since 2008 last month. The
central bank had boosted the ratio to a record high to prevent
excess lending from creating asset bubbles and stoking
inflation.  The government will have to cut the reserve ratio to
release liquidity next year if commercial banks’ foreign
exchange purchase growth decline, news portal 163.com reported
yesterday, citing former deputy central bank governor  Wu Xiaoling . Wu is now a vice director of the finance and economy
committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s top
legislative body.  Developers Decline  Poly Real Estate Group Co., China’s second-biggest
developer, slid 1.1 percent to 10.08 yuan. Gemdale Corp. plunged
2.4 percent to 4.86 yuan.  The nation will maintain property controls next year,
Xinhua reported on Dec. 23, citing Housing Minister  Jiang Weixin . The country will prioritize loans for first-home buyers
and will support reasonable property purchase demand, it said.
China has introduced measures this year including home-purchase
restrictions in 40 cities and higher mortgage requirements to
lower property prices.  Inner Mongolian Baotou Steel Union jumped 9.9 percent to
4.11 yuan, its biggest gain since June 7.  Baoshan Iron & Steel
Co. (600019) , the listed unit of China’s second-biggest steelmaker, rose
2.3 percent to 4.97 yuan. Angang Steel Co. gained 1.6 percent to
4.57 yuan.  Steel stocks provide “strong safety” as they trade at
0.99 times book value, compared with 1 times during the 2008
global financial crisis, Chu Xueliang, an analyst at China
Investment Securities, wrote in a report yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Shiyin Chen  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
