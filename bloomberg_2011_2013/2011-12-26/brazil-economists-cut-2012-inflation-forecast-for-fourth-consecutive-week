Economists covering  Brazil  reduced
their 2012 inflation forecast for the fourth straight week as
growth in Latin America’s largest economy slows, a  central bank
survey  showed.  Consumer prices will increase 5.33 percent next year,
according to the median forecast in a central bank survey of
about 100 economists on Dec. 23, less than the 5.39 percent
forecast the week earlier.  “What caused the move is concern about slower economic
growth,” Thais Zara, associate economist with Rosenberg and
Associates Inc., said by telephone from Sao Paulo.  Analysts cut their growth forecasts this year to 2.9
percent from 2.92 percent, today’s survey showed. That compares
with growth of 7.5 percent last year. Gross domestic product
will expand 3.4 percent next year, according to the survey,
unchanged from the previous week.  The administration of President  Dilma Rousseff  is targeting
growth of 5 percent next year and said there is room to use
monetary policy to stimulate the economy. Central bank President
Alexandre Tombini began slashing  interest rates  in August, in
anticipation of a global downturn. In the past month, the
 European Central Bank ,  Australia , Denmark and Norway all cut
rates.  Economists expect Brazil’s central bank to cut its key rate
by 0.5 percentage point to 10.5 percent in January, and to 9.5
percent by the end of 2012 as inflation slows, the survey found.
Tombini reduced the benchmark rate last month for a third
straight meeting to help shield Brazil from the European crisis.  Missing the Target  Consumer prices, as measured by the  IPCA index , will rise
6.54 percent this year, up from a forecast of 6.52 percent last
week, the survey showed. It would be the first time that the
central bank misses its target since 2003.  Brazil targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Annual inflation slowed for a second straight month in
November, to 6.64 percent. Inflation has exceeded the upper
limit of the target range since April.  The real gained 0.18 percent to 1.8537 per dollar, while
the yield on the interest-rate futures contract due in January
2013 remained unchanged at 10.06 percent at 10 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
