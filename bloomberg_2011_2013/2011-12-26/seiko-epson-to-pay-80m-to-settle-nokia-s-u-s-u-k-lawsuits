     Dec. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Seiko Epson Corp. (6724) , a Japanese maker
of printers and scanners,  agreed  to pay $80 million to settle
antitrust lawsuits filed by  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  in the U.S. and U.K.  Seiko Epson  will incur an extraordinary loss in its third
quarter because of the settlement, the Nagano, Japan-based
company said in a Tokyo Stock Exchange filing today. The
settlement, relating to suits over supplies of liquid-crystal
displays, won’t alter the full-year earnings forecast, according
to the statement.  Yuzo Okada, a spokesman for Seiko Epson, declined to
comment on a possible date for the settlement transaction.  Seiko Epson fell 0.7 percent to 1,017 yen at the close in
Tokyo trading. The stock has lost 31 percent this year, compared
with a 17 percent drop by the Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
