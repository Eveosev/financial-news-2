Japan Hotel & Resort Inc. (8981) , a real
estate investment trust, surged the most in eight months after
it said it will merge with  Nippon Hotel Fund Investment Corp. (8985)  to
boost its asset size and share performance.  Japan Hotel jumped 5.8 percent, the most since April 22, to
164,900 yen in Tokyo. Nippon Hotel gained 1.2 percent to 187,300
yen, and has declined 29 percent this year. The Tokyo Stock
Exchange was closed Dec. 23 to observe a national holiday.  Nippon Hotel will split its shares into 12 and sell 1.16
million of new shares to pay for the acquisition, the companies
said in a joint statement on Dec. 22. The transaction is valued
at 17.5 billion yen ($224 million) based on Nippon Hotel’s Dec.
21 closing price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Japan
Hotel will be delisted by March 28, according the statement.  “The key will be to see if the two REITs, which are small
in terms of market capitalization, can stabilize revenue streams
and improve their financials,” Sachiko Okada and Atsuko Chiyoda, analysts at Goldman Sachs Japan Co., wrote in a report.  The merger will be effective as of April 1, the trusts said
in the statement. The manager of both REITs will also merge on
April 1, the companies said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
