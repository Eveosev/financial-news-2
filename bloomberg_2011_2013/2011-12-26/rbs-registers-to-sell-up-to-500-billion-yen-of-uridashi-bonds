Royal Bank of Scotland Plc
registered to sell as much as 500 billion yen ($6.4 billion) of
uridashi bonds, according to a filing today with  Japan â€™s finance
ministry.  The registration takes effect on Jan. 6 and is valid for
two years. A shelf registration allows for bond sales without
obligating the company or country to borrow.   Uridashi bonds are debt issued outside Japan for sale to
Japanese individual investors.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
