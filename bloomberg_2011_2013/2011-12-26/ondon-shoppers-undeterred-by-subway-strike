London  shoppers flocked to stores on
what is traditionally one of the biggest shopping days of the
year even as the  subway system  was disrupted by striking train
drivers in the first of four planned disruptions.  Transport for London said on its  website  that parts of the
subway, known as the Tube, are open and extra buses are
operating to busy shopping areas.  The New West End Company, which represents more than 600
fashion-led brands in central London’s Bond Street, Oxford
Street and Regent Street, said retailers reported sales over 15
million pounds ($23 million) in the first three hours of
trading. The company forecasts 700,000 shoppers will visit the
area today.  “Despite the Tube disruptions we’ve had a very strong
start to our Boxing Day sale with record sales in the first
hour,” Sue West, director of operations at the Selfridges
department store, said in an e-mailed statement. Sales in the
first hour of trading at its Oxford Street site were higher than
last year.  London Underground Ltd. was denied an interim injunction by
a U.K. court against the  Associated Society of Locomotive
Engineers and Firemen , on Dec. 22 to stop the train drivers
striking over demands for triple holiday pay. The strikes will
take place between today and Feb. 13.  Arsenal postponed its Premier League soccer match against
 Wolverhampton Wanderers  to Dec. 27 from today because of the
strike. The scheduled Premier League game between Chelsea and
Fulham went ahead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
