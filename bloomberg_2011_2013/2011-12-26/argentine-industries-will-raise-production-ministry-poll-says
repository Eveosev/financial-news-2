Seventy-one percent of large-scale
industrial companies polled in  Argentina  say they will increase
production next year and 54 percent will step up hiring, the
Industry Ministry said in a  statement  posted on its website.  The ministry conducted the poll of 104 companies from
October through December this year, according to the statement,
which did not provide the surveyâ€™s margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
