Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in  Thailand   trading. (SET)  Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Bangkok.  The SET Index fell 0.5 percent to 1,032.51, dropping for a
third straight session. Losses today erased the gauge’s gains
for this year.  Italian-Thai Development Pcl (ITD)  , Thailand’s biggest
construction company, gained 1.1 percent to 3.74 baht, the
highest close since Dec. 13. The company expects to sign loan
agreements next year valued at $12.5 billion to develop a
deepsea port, industrial complex and power plants in Myanmar,
Chairman Premchai Karnasuta said.  Krung Thai Bank Pcl (KTB)  , the nation’s second-biggest
lender, rose 0.7 percent to 15.1 baht, the largest gain since
Dec. 21. The company is seeking opportunities to expand into
neighboring Myanmar, Bangkok Post reported, citing President
Apisak Tantivorawong.  Sri Trang Agro-Industry Pcl (STA)  , Thailand’s biggest
publicly traded rubber producer, slid 1.1 percent to 18.2 baht.
Rubber retreated from a two-week high on concern that demand
from  China , the world’s largest consumer, may weaken on slowing
economic growth and vehicle sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
