Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI)  led shares of
Indian telecommunications companies higher in Mumbai trading
after a dispute tribunal put on hold a government order telling
wireless providers to end some roaming agreements.  Bharti,  India ’s biggest wireless services provider, gained
as much as 3.7 percent to 342.85 rupees and traded up 2.8
percent at 11:07 a.m.  Idea Cellular Ltd. (IDEA)  rose as much as 3.9
percent and  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM)  advanced 2.6 percent.  The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal will
hear the operators’ complaint against the government’s halting
of 3G roaming services agreements on Jan. 3, Bloomberg UTV
reported Dec. 24. New Delhi-based Bharti said last week it was
“shocked” by a Department of Telecommunications order to end
the roaming agreements that enable companies to offer 3G
services where they don’t own spectrum.  “The fact that TDSAT is looking at it indicates they’re
serious about it,” said Ankur Rudra, an analyst at Ambit
Capital Pvt. in Mumbai. “The faster it gets sorted out, the
better it is for the industry.”  The contracts between cellular-service providers are a
“breach of rules” and must be stopped immediately, R.
Chandrashekhar, secretary of the telecommunications department,
told Bloomberg UTV. The government department hasn’t yet decided
whether to impose a penalty on operators for violating license
terms, Chandrasekhar said.  Justice S.B. Sinha, the New Delhi-based chairman of the
tribunal, didn’t immediately answer calls to his office and
residence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
