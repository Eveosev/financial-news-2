U.K. house prices will extend
declines in 2012 as rising unemployment and weak  consumer
confidence  erode demand, Hometrack Ltd. said.  The average cost of a home will drop 3 percent by December
2012, after decreasing 2.1 percent this year and 1.6 percent in
2010, the London-based property researcher said in an e-mailed
report today. Values fell 0.2 percent this month from November.  “The fortunes of the housing market are directly linked to
the wider economy, and looking ahead to 2012 the expectation is
that growth will remain sluggish,”  Richard Donnell , Hometrack’s
director of research, said in a statement. “Low interest rates
and housing turnover will continue to act as a support to
prices, but the overall trend will be downwards.”  Property demand has weakened as banks restrict lending and
Britons are squeezed by government spending cuts and tax
increases aimed at narrowing the  budget deficit . New homebuyer
registrations, an indicator of demand, fell 11 percent in the
second half as uncertainty about the economy fueled by the euro-
area debt crisis undermined confidence, Hometrack said.  The group’s forecast adds to other predictions of falling
or stagnating U.K. house prices next year. The  Royal Institution 
of Chartered Surveyors said on Dec. 22 that values will be about
3 percent lower at the end of 2012 than in the fourth quarter of
this year.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s Halifax unit, Britain’s
largest mortgage provider, said on Dec. 12 that it saw the cost
of a home rising or falling by no more than 2 percent next year.  The only locations where property prices bucked the
national downward trend this year were affluent areas of London,
Halifax said. Northern England may experience “above average
acceleration in price falls over 2012.”  In a separate report today, Halifax said the number of
Britons who bought their first property decreased 7 percent to
187,000 in 2011 from the previous year, the lowest reading since
records began in 1974. Hometrack said the “flipside of a weak
sales market” will be demand for rental properties. It sees
rents rising an average of 2 percent next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
