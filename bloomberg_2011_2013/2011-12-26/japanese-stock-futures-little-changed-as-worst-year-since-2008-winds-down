(Corrects expiration of Nikkei  futures (TPX)  in 2nd paragraph.)  Japanese  stock (MXAP)   futures  opened little
changed in Osaka after the Topix Index yesterday had the lowest
turnover in more than eight years as markets across Asia were
shut for holidays and Japanese shares headed for their worst
annual performance since 2008.  Futures on the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in March
were bid in the pre-market at 8,450 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local

Zealand  are closed today. The Nikkei is headed for a 17 percent
decline this year.  “There’s no outstanding catalyst to buy stocks,” said
 Fumiyuki Nakanishi , a strategist at Tokyo-based SMBC Friend
Securities Co. “Trading energy plunged in the Tokyo market
yesterday. Today as well, we can’t expect foreign investors to
buy shares as the overseas markets are closed.”  The  value  of stocks traded on Japan’s Topix fell to 500.8
billion yen ($6.4 billion) yesterday, the lowest full-day
turnover since May 27, 2003, according to data compiled by

last night in Tokyo, compared with 77.97 at the close of stock
trading yesterday. Against the euro, the currency strengthened
