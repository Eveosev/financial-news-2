Spain’s Economy and Competition
Minister Luis de Guindos said the euro area’s fourth-largest
 economy  has suffered a “relapse” and will contract as the
 People’s Party  takes over the nation’s finances from the
Socialists.  “The Spanish economy has had a relapse and we are
returning to a negative growth rate,” de Guindos said in Madrid
today. “The next two quarters aren’t going to be easy.”  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy , who named his government last
week after his People’s Party’s landslide victory on Nov. 20,
has pledged to tackle the budget deficit, the euro area’s  third-
largest , after  growth  stalled in the third quarter. De Guindos
is in charge of overhauling the financial sector to restore the
flow of credit to the economy and of battling a 23 percent
jobless rate. Cristobal Montoro has been named budget minister
with the task of reordering public finances.  Rajoy said on Dec. 19 that his government’s growth forecast
for  Spain  next year will be “in line” with the European
Commission’s estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
