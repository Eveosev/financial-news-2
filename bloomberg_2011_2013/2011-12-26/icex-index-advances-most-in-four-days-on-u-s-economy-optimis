Russian stocks (INDEXCF)  gained the most in four trading sessions on optimism
the  U.S. economy  will extend its recovery, helping to boost global output.  The Micex Index increased 1 percent to 1,390.08 at a closure time at 6:45 p.m. in Moscow,
with all but three of the component stocks advancing. The dollar-measured RTS Index rose 1.4
percent to 1,413.52.  OAO Transneft, Russia’s oil-pipeline operator, and steelmaker OAO Severstal rose 2.2
percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. OAO Novolipetsk Steel increased 1.6 percent.  “Given the more evident optimism and closing strength on  Wall Street  ahead of the
Christmas break, and the uneventful protest on Saturday, Moscow’s bourses should trade
better over the first part of the week,” said  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Troika Dialog,
Russia’s oldest investment bank. More than 30,000 people staged a protest against the
government on Dec. 24 without widespread violence or reported arrests.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.9 percent on Dec. 23, erasing its losses for this year
before the Christmas break, as U.S. Commerce Department data showed orders for goods
meant to last at least three months rose 3.8 percent in November. London markets are also
closed today.  The Micex, which has lost 18 percent this year,  trades  at about 4.6 times analysts’ earnings
estimates for member companies, the cheapest valuation of the 21 major  emerging markets 
tracked by Bloomberg. Brent oil, the benchmark for Russian crude, settled on Dec. 23 at
$107.96 a barrel, gaining 14 percent this year.  “We should see a higher crude price when traders return tomorrow,” Weafer said. “This will
provide support for the ruble and for  Russia ’s oil and gas sector stocks.”  OAO Surgutneftegas, the country’s No. 4 oil producer, advanced 1.2 percent to 24.95 rubles,
while bigger rival OAO Rosneft increased 0.8 percent to 211.35 rubles. OAO Gazprom, the
world’s largest gas producer, gained 1 percent to 171.51 rubles.  OAO Gazprom Neft, Gazprom’s oil arm, retailer OAO Magnit and Moscow utility OAO
Mosenergo were the only decliners, falling 1.9 percent to 142.70 rubles, 0.3 percent to
2,709.80 rubles and 1 percent to 1.79 rubles, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
