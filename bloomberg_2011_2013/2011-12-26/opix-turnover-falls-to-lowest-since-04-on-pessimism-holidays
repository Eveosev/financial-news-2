The  value  of stocks traded on
 Japan ’s  Topix (TPX)  Index fell to the lowest level in more than seven
years as shares on the gauge slide toward the biggest annual
decline since 2008 and markets across Asia were shut for public
holidays.  Turnover on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
fell to 500.8 billion yen ($6.4 billion) today, the lowest since
Dec. 30, 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.
This year’s daily average is 1.28 trillion yen. Markets in Hong
Kong, Australia,  New Zealand  and Singapore were closed today.  Natural disasters at home and in Thailand as well as a
surge in the yen amid Europe’s debt crisis drove the  Topix  down
19 percent this year, more than the 12 percent decline on the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index . There a four trading days left in 2011,
set to be the worst year for the gauge since 2008.  The Tokyo Stock Exchange was open for only a partial day on
Dec. 30, 2004. Today’s turnover was the lowest on a full-day
basis since May 27, 2003.  To contact the reporters on this story:
