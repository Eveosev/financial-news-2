The U.S. government received record
demand for its bonds in 2011, pushing longer-maturity Treasuries
to their best performance since 1995 in a sign that President
 Barack Obama  may have little difficulty financing a fourth
consecutive year of $1 trillion budget deficits.  The Treasury Department attracted $3.04 for each dollar of
the $2.135 trillion in notes and bonds sold, the most since the
government began releasing the data in 1992 during the George H.
W. Bush administration. The U.S. drew an all-time high  bid-to-
cover  ratio of 9.07 for $30 billion of four-week bills it
auctioned on Dec. 20 even though they pay zero percent interest.  While Standard & Poor’s stripped the U.S. of its AAA credit
rating on Aug. 5, Treasuries due in 10 years or more returned
25.6 percent this year. The spreading sovereign debt crisis in
 Europe  and slower global growth are driving investors to the
safety of U.S. assets, helping to contain borrowing costs and
making it cheaper as a percentage of gross domestic product to
finance deficits than when the nation last had budget surpluses.  “If the last two weeks are any indication of how next year
will start, there’s near-insatiable demand,” Ira Jersey, an
interest-rate strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in New York,
one of 21 primary dealers that are required to bid at the
auctions, said in a Dec. 21 telephone interview. “We have a
significantly shrinking supply of risk-free assets in the world
and U.S. Treasuries are one of the few left.”  Beating Commodities, Stocks  The last time longer-maturity Treasuries returned as much
as this year was in 1995, when they rallied 30.7 percent.  Treasuries were some of the best assets to own this year,
returning 8.9 percent, compared with a decline of 8 percent for
the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials and a
0.6 percent gain in the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index of stocks.
Global sovereign debt and mortgage-backed securities rose 5.8
percent, and corporate bonds climbed 4.3 percent, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch bond indexes.  The dollar is poised to strengthen for a second straight
year against its major trading partners, appreciating 1.2
percent as measured by IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar
Index. The gauge rose 1.5 percent in 2010.  “The U.S. is benefiting from a very unstable global
environment,”  Scott Graham , the head of government bond trading
at the Bank of Montreal’s BMO Capital Markets unit in  Chicago , a
primary dealer, said in a Dec. 21 telephone interview. “At some
point you’d think demand would wane if Europe gets settled.”  Falling Yields  While yields on 10-year notes rose 18 basis points, or 0.18
percentage point, last week to 2.02 percent, they are down from
3.3 percent at the end of 2010, Bloomberg Bond Trader prices
show. The yield fell one basis point to 2.01 percent at 3:07
p.m. in  New York , and the 2 percent security due November 2021
added 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 99 28/32.  Low yields mean that interest expense accounted for 3
percent of the economy in fiscal 2011 ended Sept. 30, down from
4 percent in 1999. When the U.S. ran budget surpluses between
1998 and 2001 the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.26.  “Some of the trades that appeared obvious have been
wrong,” John Fath, a principal at the investment firm BTG
Pactual in New York who manages $2.5 billion of bonds, said in a
Dec. 21 telephone interview. “Most people thought if the U.S.
was downgraded it would lead to higher rates. Most people argued
that increasing deficits would be more difficult to finance.”  Caught Off Guard  Among those caught off guard by the strong demand for
Treasuries was  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond
mutual fund at Pacific Investment Management Co. In February,
Gross had a net bet against Treasuries in the firm’s flagship
 Total Return Fund (PTTRX) , which has gained 3.3 percent this year,
ranking in the 28th percentile of similar funds, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “This no-Treasury thing is simply a demonstration of
vigilance on the part of Pimco that says these bonds aren’t
worth what others appear to think they’re worth, and we prefer
another menu, that’s all,” Gross said in an April 20 telephone
interview.  Government and Treasury debt now make up 23 percent of the
$241 billion Total Return Fund, according to data posted on
 Newport Beach , California-based Pimco’s website Dec. 9.  Gross wasn’t the only one surprised by the performance of
Treasuries. The median estimate of 70 economists and strategists
surveyed by Bloomberg in early January was for 10-year yields to
end this year at 3.75 percent. FTN Financial had the lowest
estimate, at 2 percent. For the end of 2012, the median forecast
is 2.6 percent.  Steady Decline  Ten-year yields, which are a benchmark for everything from
corporate bonds to  mortgages , have been on a steady decline
since 1981, when they exceeded 15 percent.  They were at 6.57 percent in January 1993 at the end of the
elder Bush’s presidency, down from 9.54 percent in early 1989
when he took office as the Fed cut its target rate for overnight
loans between banks to 3 percent from a high of 9.75 percent in
February 1989 as growth slowed. Yields have averaged 4.92
percent since  Bill Clinton  was sworn in as President in 1993.  The worst financial crisis since the Great Depression
boosted the allure of Treasuries, as investors sought a haven
amid a plunge in the value of higher risk assets such as stocks
and corporate bonds. The Fed has kept its  target rate  in a range
of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, and has pledged to
keep there until mid-2013.  Bid-to-cover ratios at Treasury auctions averaged $2.99 in
2010, up from $2.50 in 2009 and $2.23 the prior year.  Accelerating Demand  Demand accelerated toward the end of the year, with
investors bidding $3.20 per dollar of securities sold in
November and December amid concern that the health of the
European economy was deteriorating and that Italy may need a
bailout.  The Treasury market has benefited from being one of the
only refuges left for investors even as the amount of U.S.
government borrowing surpassed  $15 trillion . The yen is the only
major currency to have outperformed  the dollar (DXY) , rising 4.1
percent.  “You have a lot of risk-free, high-quality assets globally
that are no longer risk-free, in terms of the other global
sovereigns,” Christopher Bury, co-head of fixed-income rates at
Jefferies & Co., a primary dealer, said in a Dec. 16 telephone
interview. “You have more people chasing fewer risk-free
assets. Everything points right now in the same direction.”  Rolling Returns  U.S. government debt  will post its best five-year
performance, gaining 39 percent from the start of 2007, since
they returned 45 percent from 1998 through 2002, a period that
included the failure of Long-Term Capital Management LP, the
collapse in internet stocks and the Sept. 11 terror attacks.  That’s even as  budget deficits  have totaled $4 trillion in
the three fiscal years from October 2008 through September 2011.
The shortfall may narrow to $1.1 trillion in fiscal 2012 from
$1.3 trillion in 2011, according to a survey of bond dealers in
the minutes of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee’s Nov.
2 meeting.  The Obama administration will ask Congress to increase
federal borrowing authority by $1.2 trillion as the nation
approaches the debt limit set by law, according to a Treasury
Department official. The White House will send the request to
Congress on Dec. 30, the day the debt is projected to rise to
within $100 billion of the $15.194 trillion limit, the Treasury
official told reporters today on condition of anonymity.  About 45 percent of the $7.76 trillion in Treasury notes
and bonds will need to be refinanced by the end of 2014,
highlighting the importance of continued demand.  “I’m not as concerned” about the ability of the Treasury
to attract borrowers “as I am about the economy being self-
sustaining,”  David Coard , head of fixed-income trading in New
York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for institutional
investors, said in a Dec. 21 telephone interview.  Economic Outlook  The economy will probably expand 2.1 percent in 2012 and
2.5 percent in 2013, according to median forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey. The Fed’s forecast is for 2.7 percent
growth in 2012 and 3.25 percent in 2013.  In addition to keeping its benchmark rate at a record low,
policy makers moved on Sept. 21 to contain yields, saying the
central bank would buy $400 billion of longer-term  government
securities  and sell $400 billion of short-term debt.  The Fed “still believes that lower rates are good, and
it’s going to do all that it can to keep rates down and have
them stay there,” Eric Pellicciaro, head of global rates
investment at New York-based BlackRock Inc., which manages $1.14
trillion in fixed-income assets, said in a Dec. 16 telephone
interview. “They’re not going to settle for trend growth. They
want more.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
