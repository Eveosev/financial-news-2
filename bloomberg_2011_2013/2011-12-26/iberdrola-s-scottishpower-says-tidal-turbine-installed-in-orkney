Iberdrola SA (IBE) ’s ScottishPower unit
said an underwater turbine designed to form part of the world’s
first tidal-power array was deployed in the sea around Orkney.  The 1-megawatt Hammerfest Stroem HS1000 unit is the same
machine that will be used by ScottishPower at the Sound of Islay
tidal array, the Glasgow-based company said today in an e-mailed
statement. The company’s proposal for a 10-megawatt project won
planning approval from the Scottish government in March.  The HS1000 device will be tested ahead of its larger-scale
production and installation, ScottishPower said. The company
expects the machine to be fully operational in early 2012 and
the Islay units to be installed in 2013 to 2015.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
