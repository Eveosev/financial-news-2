Australia  reached 277-6 on day one
of the series-opening Test against India at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground as opening batsman Ed Cowan top scored with 68 in
his debut.  The home team lost Michael Clarke, Mike Hussey and Cowan in
the final session to slip to 214-6 after reaching 170-3 at the
tea break. Brad Haddin (21 not out) and Peter Siddle (34 not
out) then shared an unbroken 63-run partnership.  India fast bowler Umesh Yadav took 3-96, including
dismissing  Ricky Ponting  for 62, while Zaheer Khan removed
Clarke and Hussey in consecutive balls.  The teams are scheduled to play four Tests with matches in
Sydney, Perth and Adelaide to follow.  India , seeking to win its
first Test series in Australia since it first began touring
there in 1947, holds the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after winning
the last two series at home.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
