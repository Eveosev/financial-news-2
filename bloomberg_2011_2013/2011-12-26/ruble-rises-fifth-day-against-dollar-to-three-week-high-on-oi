The ruble strengthened against the
dollar for a fifth day to a three-week high on optimism the U.S.
economic recovery will bolster demand for oil, the country’s
biggest export.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 31.1400 by
closure at 7 p.m. in Moscow, heading for its strongest level
since Dec. 5. The ruble was little changed at 40.6625 versus the
euro. That put it at 35.4251 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket, a fourth day of advances.  Oil futures rose 15 cents to $99.68 a barrel on Dec. 23
after U.S. initial jobless claims dropped to the lowest level
since April 2008. Markets in the U.S. and western  Europe  are
closed for the Christmas holiday today.  Russia ’s central bank cut the refinancing rate to 8 percent
from 8.25 percent Dec. 23 after inflation eased to 6.4 percent
as of Dec. 19 from a year earlier, heading for its lowest annual
growth in two decades.  Investors pared bets the Russian currency will weaken
further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
31.5715 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 31.6365 per dollar yesterday. The contracts are a guide to
expectations of currency movements as they allow investors and
companies to fix the  exchange rate  at a particular level in the
future.  Russia’s dollar-denominated Eurobond due in 2020 fell,
pushing the yield two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
higher to 4.617 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
