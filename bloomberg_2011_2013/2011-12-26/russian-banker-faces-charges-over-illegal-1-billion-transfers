Russian authorities detained a
Russian bank official for illegal transfers of about $1 billion
in rubles, police spokesman Roman Mikhailov said by phone today.  The name of the banker or his employer werenâ€™t divulged.
The transfers took place over a period of a year, with the
involvement of two accomplices from a criminal group, Mikhailov
said. The banker is being held under house arrest while the two
accomplices are sought by authorities, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
