Emerging-market stocks closed little
changed as gains among Indian shares were offset by speculation
that last week’s rally for South Korea and Taiwan equities may
have been excessive.  South Korea’s  Kospi (KOSPI)  retreated from last week’s 1.5 percent
gain as shipbuilders fell, Taiwan’s Taiex Index slipped after
rallying 4.8 percent last week and Brazil’s Bovespa fell for the
first time in three sessions as economists cut their 2011 growth
forecast for the fifth straight week. The BSE India  Sensitive
Index (SENSEX)  advanced amid speculation the nation’s central bank may
take measures to ease a cash crunch.  Mexican stocks (MEXBOL)  also rose.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  fell 0.01 percent to 927.63
as of the close in New York. Of the index’s members, 246 stocks
fell and 230 rose. The measure advanced 2.6 percent last week,
driving valuations to 10.1 times estimated earnings amid signs
the  U.S. economy  is recovering. Reports tomorrow may show home
prices in 20 U.S. cities probably declined at a slower pace and
consumer confidence improved to a five-month high.  “With key markets closed for holidays, it’s hard to make
strong bets especially following solid gains last week,” said
Lim Chang Gue, a fund manager in Seoul at Samsung Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $29 billion.  Financial markets from Hong Kong to Malaysia, Indonesia,
the U.K. and the U.S. are closed for holidays today. The MSCI
emerging-market index has fallen 19 percent this year, more than
a 7.6 percent loss in the MSCI World Index of developed nations.  Outlook for 2012  Emerging-market stocks may rally at least 28 percent by the
end of 2012, according to Citigroup Inc., which says current
cash positions and equity allocations of investment funds are
better indicators of future performance than money flows.  Indian equities gained after a jump in the nation’s money-
market rates to a three-year high fueled speculation the central
bank will cut lenders’ reserve requirements for the first time
since 2009. The Sensex gained 1.5 percent.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , India’s second-biggest lender, rose 1.1
percent.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering company,
advanced 1.7 percent.  Brazilian stocks fell after economists cut their 2011
economic growth forecast to 2.9 percent from 2.92 percent the
week earlier. The Bovespa retreated 0.1 percent. Aircraft
manufacturer  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  was the worst performer with a 2.1
percent fall.  Kospi Retreats  The Kospi dropped 0.6 percent.  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine
Engineering Co. (042660)  led South Korean shipyards lower, falling by 3.9
percent in Seoul after saying it expects new orders to drop 23
percent next year as shipping lines struggle with an oversupply
of vessels and falling rates.  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540)  sank
2.2 percent, while  Samsung Heavy Industries Co. (010140)  dropped 2.9
percent.  China’s stocks (SHCOMP)  fell, extending the longest weekly slide in
three years, as the nation’s seven-day repurchase rate jumped
toward the highest level since Nov. 23 and after the official
Xinhua News Agency said the railway ministry will reduce
spending by 15 percent in 2012.  CSR Corp. (601766) , the nation’s biggest
train maker, tumbled 7.3 percent in Shanghai.  Mexican stocks gained 0.5 percent, led by airport operator
Grupo Aeroportuario del Sur SAB, which rose 5.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
