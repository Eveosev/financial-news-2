Oil traded near the highest
settlement in two weeks amid speculation the  U.S. economy  will
continue to recover, bolstering demand for raw materials in the
world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures were little changed after gaining 6.6 percent last
week, the most since the five days ending Oct. 28. Reports today
may show U.S. consumer confidence improved to a five-month high
and home prices in 20 cities declined at a slower pace.
Financial markets from  Hong Kong  to the U.K. and the U.S. were
closed for holidays yesterday.  “Economic indicators, especially in the U.S., are
improving,” said  Tetsu Emori , a commodity fund manager at
Astmax Co. in  Tokyo , who forecasts oil will trade “more or
less” at the $100-level in coming months.  Crude oil for February delivery was at $99.53 a barrel,
down 15 cents from the Dec. 23 settlement, in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 9:01 a.m. London time.
Prices settled at $99.68 on Dec. 23, the highest closing level
since Dec. 13. Futures have climbed 8.9 percent this year after
increasing 15 percent in 2010.  Brent oil for February settlement traded 18 cents higher at
$108.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European contract’s premium to Nymex crude was
$8.61, compared with $8.28 a barrel Dec. 23, the smallest
differential based on closing prices since March 8.  Oil Traders Flee  Large traders have pulled out of the oil market in recent
weeks, cutting bets to a four-year low as crude climbed above
$100 a barrel on rising tension with  Iran , then fell on concern
over the European economy.  Outstanding contracts  among the biggest players in the
futures market, including swaps dealers, hedge funds, producers
and commercial users, fell by 4.9 percent to 2,207,528
contracts, the lowest since May 2007, in the seven days ended
Dec. 20, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s
Commitments of Traders report on Dec. 23.  Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest oil exporter, needs $74 a
barrel for its crude exports next year to balance its budget,
according to a report from Jadwa Investment Co., a diversified
investment business based in  Riyadh . That means the kingdom
needs prices of about $70 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate
and $78 a barrel for Brent, Jadwa said.  Oil rose as high as $101.25 on Dec. 13 after Iran announced
plans for military exercises in the  Strait of Hormuz , a critical
waterway for crude shipments, as the U.S. and its allies
threatened to increase sanctions over the Persian Gulf country’s
nuclear program. Futures plunged as low as $92.52 three days
later on speculation that European economic growth may slow,
undermining demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
