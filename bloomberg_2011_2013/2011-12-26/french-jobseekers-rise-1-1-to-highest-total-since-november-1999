French jobless claims climbed to the
highest 12 years as a slowing economy and worsening business
climate discouraged hiring.  The number of people actively looking for work at the end
of November rose by 29,900, or 1.1 percent, to 2,844,800, the
Labor Ministry said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the
highest total since November 1999. The number of jobless climbed
5.2 percent from a year earlier.  The French economy is probably already in recession, with
output shrinking this quarter and probably next, state
statistical institute Insee said two weeks ago. While  business
confidence  dropped to the lowest in 1 1/2 years in December and
manufacturing contracted, government leaders have refused to use
the word recession, saying  France  is in a “slowdown” or an
“air pocket.”  Stalling growth and rising joblessness are threatening
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  as he prepares for the May 2012
election, with polls showing him running behind Socialist Party
challenger  Francois Hollande .  To contact the reporters on this story:
