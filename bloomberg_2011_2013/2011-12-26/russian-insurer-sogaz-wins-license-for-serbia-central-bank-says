Sogaz, a Russian insurer, obtained a
license to do business in Serbia, together with the countryâ€™s
gas monopoly Srbijagas, the central bank said in a  statement 
today.  The joint venture, in which Sogaz will hold a 51 percent
stake, will operate as Sogaz a.d.o. and focus on non-life
insurance in the energy and oil industries. The two companies
paid six million euros ($7.8 million) for the license, the
central bank said.  Srbijagas first indicated interest in financial services in
2009, after  OAO Gazprom Neft (SIBN)  acquired a 51 percent stake in the
Serbian oil company  Naftna Industrija Srbije AD. (NIIS)   To contact the reporter on this story:
