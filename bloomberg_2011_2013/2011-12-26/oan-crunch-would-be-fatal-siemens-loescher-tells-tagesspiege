Siemens AG  Chief Executive Officer
 Peter Loescher  said a credit crunch would be fatal for the
company’s business as well as for its customers,  Tagesspiegel 
reported today, citing an interview.  Still, the  European Central Bank  has shown that it’s
“alert and ready to act,” Loescher told the newspaper.  The real economy is performing “more robustly than the
headlines from the finance world would have you believe,”
Loescher also told Tagesspiegel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
