India ’s 10-year bonds fell the most
in 11 weeks as a shortage of  cash  in the banking system made it
costlier to buy debt with borrowed funds.  The rate on  overnight  loans in the interbank money market
rose to a high of 9.90 percent from 8.55 percent at the end of
last month, signaling a decline in cash at banks. Demand for
bonds also waned on concern the government will borrow more than
planned in the fiscal year ending March 31 as an economic
slowdown erodes revenue, according to R.S. Chauhan, chief dealer
of treasury in Mumbai at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur.  “The cash crunch is deterring investors from adding to
bond holdings,” said Chauhan. “They are also waiting for some
clarity on government debt sales.”  The yield on the 8.79 percent notes due November 2021 rose
12 basis points, the most since Oct. 10, to 8.49 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  The rupee appreciated 0.5 percent to 52.71 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  finance ministry  has a target to borrow a record 4.7
trillion rupees ($89.2 billion) this fiscal year. Central bank
Governor Duvvuri Subbarao signaled on Dec. 22 that India’s $1.7
trillion economy may expand less than an earlier estimate of 7.6
percent in the year through March 2012.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in funding costs,
rose three basis points to 7.78 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
