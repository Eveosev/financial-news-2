The dollar  maintained (DXY)  losses from
last week against most of its major counterparts on speculation
a report tomorrow will show U.S. consumer confidence rose to the
highest since July, damping demand for haven assets.  The euro held a drop against the yen before Italy auctions
as much as 20 billion euros ($26.1 billion) of bills and bonds
this week amid concern the region’s debt crisis is worsening.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars traded within 0.6 percent
of two-week highs as Japanese stocks rose. China’s yuan advanced
to the strongest level in 17 years on speculation policy makers
will tolerate appreciation to stem capital outflows.  “Excessive pessimism has receded at the end of the year,
and what we’re seeing is some unwinding of safe-haven buying of
currencies like the dollar and yen,” said Kengo Suzuki, manager
of the foreign-bond department in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Securities Co.,
a unit of  Japan ’s third-biggest listed bank by market value.
“The  U.S. economy  is resilient.”  The dollar declined 0.1 percent to $1.3056 per euro and was
little changed at 77.98 yen at 7:20 a.m. in  London  from last
week in  New York . The euro traded 101.83 yen from 101.86 on Dec.
23, when it dropped 0.2 percent.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the euro,
yen and pound, fell 0.2 percent last week.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1 percent, following
a 0.9 percent gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and a 0.8
percent climb in the Stoxx Europe 600 Index on Dec. 23.  Financial markets from  Hong Kong  to  Singapore , the U.K. and
the U.S. are closed for holidays today.  Recovery Signs  An  index  of  consumer confidence  in the U.S. rose to 58.6
this month from 56 in November, according to the median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the New York-
based Conference Board reports the figures.  Home prices  in 20 U.S. cities probably  declined  at a slower
pace in October. Property values dropped 3.2 percent from the
same month in 2010, the smallest year-over-year decrease since
January, according to a separate Bloomberg survey. S&P/Case
Shiller will release the data tomorrow.  “The U.S. economy seems to be moving towards solid
growth,” said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher at Gaitame.com
Research Institute Ltd. in Tokyo, a unit of Japan’s largest
currency-margin company. “The dollar might get sold on the back
of good U.S. data against currencies such as the euro, pound or
Australian dollar from a general bid for risk.”  The Australian dollar rose 0.1 percent to $1.0165. It
touched $1.0219 on Dec. 21, the highest since Dec. 12.  New
Zealand ’s dollar was at 77.40 U.S. cents from 77.44 last week.
It reached 77.76 on Dec. 21, the most since Dec. 8.  The pound strengthened 0.2 percent to $1.5624.  Italian Issuance  Demand for the 17-nation euro was limited as Italy plans to
sell 9 billion euros of 179-day bills and as much as 2.5 billion
euros of zero 2013 bonds on Dec. 28. It will auction on Dec. 29
bonds due in 2014, 2018, 2021 and 2022.  The nation plans to sell almost 450 billion euros of
securities in 2012 to pay for maturing bonds and bills and cover
the government’s budget deficit, Il Sole 24-Ore said on Dec. 24,
citing an interview with Maria Cannata, director of public debt.
 Italy  needs to finance 23.6 billion euros of deficit and faces
202 billion euros of redemptions next year, the newspaper said.  Ten-year bond  yields  in Italy rose six basis points to 6.98
percent on Dec. 23, approaching the 7 percent level that spurred
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek bailouts.  Yuan Policy  “I can’t find any reasons to aggressively buy the euro,”
Kawabata said. “Italy has huge amounts of debt rolling over
next year, so even if auctions this week go well, it doesn’t
mean that they have overcome the underlying problem.”  The euro depreciated 1.3 percent this year against nine
developed-nation counterparts, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The dollar advanced 1.1
percent and the yen gained 3.9 percent.  China ’s currency climbed for a second day as the central
bank set the  reference rate  0.07 percent higher at 6.3167 per
dollar. A depreciation of the yuan may fuel outflows of capital,
Yi Xianrong, a researcher at the Institute of Finance and
Banking that is affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, wrote in a commentary in the China Daily today.  “The fixing shows the central bank’s determination to push
forward with appreciation,” said  Liu Dongliang , a senior
analyst in Shenzhen at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s
sixth-biggest lender. “The market has fully taken the signals
sent through the fixings.”  The yuan strengthened as much as 0.3 percent to 6.3181 per
dollar, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
That was its strongest level since the country unified the
official and market exchange rates at the end of 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
