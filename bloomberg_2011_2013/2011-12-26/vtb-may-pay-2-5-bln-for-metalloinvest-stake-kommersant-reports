VTB,  Russia ’s second-largest bank,
may pay as much as $2.5 billion for Vasily Anisimov’s stake in
OAO Metalloinvest,  Kommersant  reported today, citing people it
didn’t identify.  Anisimov’s Coalco Metals agreed to sell its 20 percent
stake in the steel and iron ore producer to VTB last week.
Coalco will use part of the proceeds to pay back a $1.9 billion
loan to VTB, Interfax said late Friday, citing VTB chief Andrey
Kostin.  Billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who holds 45 percent of
Metalloinvest, said in e-mailed statement that he “welcomes”
VTB as a new Metalloinvest shareholder and that the partnership
will be beneficial for the company and all its shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
