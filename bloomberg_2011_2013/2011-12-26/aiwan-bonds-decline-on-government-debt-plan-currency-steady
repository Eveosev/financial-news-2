Taiwan’s government bonds fell, with
the benchmark 10-year yield rising to the highest in almost
three weeks, after the Ministry of Finance said it plans to sell
27 percent more debt in next year’s first quarter.  The government will sell NT$185 billion ($6.1 billion) in
the three months through March 31, compared with NT$145 billion
a year earlier, the ministry said on Dec. 23. Ten-year notes
trimmed losses after an auction of NT$35 billion in similar-
maturity debt attracted bids worth 1.48 times the amount on
sale, the highest ratio since June.  “The market is a bit overwhelmed by the large increase in
bond sales in 2012,” said  James Wang , a fixed-income trader at
Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei. “Yields should rise as a
result of the bigger supply.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes maturing in September
2021, the most-traded  government securities , rose to 1.290
percent from 1.285 percent, according to prices from Gretai
Securities Market. It earlier reached 1.30 percent, the highest
level for benchmark 10-year rates since Dec. 2.  Taiwan’s dollar was little changed at NT$30.308 against its
U.S. counterpart, compared with NT$30.296 on Dec. 23, according
to Taipei Forex Inc.  The  overnight money-market rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, rose one basis point to 0.409 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
