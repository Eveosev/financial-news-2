OAO Lukoil ,  Russia ’s second largest
oil producer, plans to spend 285 billion rubles ($9 billion) on
refining upgrades to 2016, billionaire Chief Executive Officer
Vagit Alekperov said on state television.  Investment in refining over the next 10 years will reach
400 billion rubles as the company improves fuel quality,
Alekperov said in an interview broadcast today on the Rossiya 24

$13 billion to $16 billion a year over the same period as it
develops fields in Russia, Iraq, Uzbekistan and the Caspian Sea,
