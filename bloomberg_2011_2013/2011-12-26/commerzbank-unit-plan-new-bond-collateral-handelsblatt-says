Commerzbank AG  and its Eurohypo unit
plan to offer new types of collateral on bonds as early as next
year,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified investors and
people within the companies.  Commerzbank plans to use loans to small and medium-sized
companies to secure the bonds, while Eurohypo will use mortgages
that arenâ€™t deemed safe enough to be used for German Pfandbrief-
type covered bonds.  Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, an unrelated company,
plans to issue an aircraft mortgage bond in 2012, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
