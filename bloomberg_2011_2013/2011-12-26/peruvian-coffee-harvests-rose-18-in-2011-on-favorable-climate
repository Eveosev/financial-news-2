(Corrects bag weight to 46 kilograms in second paragraph.)  Peru’s coffee harvest rose 18
percent in 2011 on “favorable climate conditions,” the Andean
country’s National Coffee Board said.  Peru produced 6.2 million 46-kilogram bags this year,
compared with 5.25 million bags in 2010, the industry group said
today in an e-mailed statement. Coffee export revenue jumped 58
percent to $1.4 billion in 2011, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
