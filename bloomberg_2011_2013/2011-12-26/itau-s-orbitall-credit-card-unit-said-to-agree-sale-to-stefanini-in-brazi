Itau Unibanco Holding SA ,  Latin
America ’s largest bank, is selling the credit- and debit-card
processing unit it acquired in 2004 to a Brazilian software
producer, according to two people familiar with the transaction.  Itau, located in Sao Paulo, agreed to sell its Orbitall
subsidiary to Jaguariuna-based Stefanini Consultoria &
Assessoria em Informatica SA for an undisclosed sum, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the deal hasn’t
been announced.  Stefanini, which provides information technology and
consulting, invested $100 million over the past 11 months to buy
two companies in the U.S., TechTeam Global Inc. of Southfield,
 Michigan , and CXI, and one in  Colombia , Informática &
Tecnologia, according to its website. The Brazilian company,
which operates in 28 countries and forecasts 2011 revenue of
1.25 billion reais ($673 million), has set aside another $120
million for acquisitions through 2013, 60 percent directed for
purchases outside of  Brazil , the website shows.  Officials from Stefanini and Itau declined to comment
yesterday.  Orbitall, based in  Sao Paulo , had net revenue of 529.7
million reais in 2009, according to the most recent data
compiled by Bloomberg. Itau increased its ownership in the
company to 100 percent from 33.3 percent after paying 281
million reais in 2004 for stakes held by New York-based
Citigroup Inc. and Uniao de Bancos Brasileiros SA, known as
Unibanco. Itau bought Unibanco in 2009 to become the region’s
largest bank by market value.  Itau’s preferred shares rose 0.16 percent to 34.31 reais in
Sao Paulo today, compared with a 0.58 percent gain for the
benchmark Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
