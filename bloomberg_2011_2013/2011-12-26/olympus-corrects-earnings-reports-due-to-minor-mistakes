Olympus Corp. (7733) , the Japanese camera
maker reeling from a $1.7 billion accounting fraud, amended
earnings reports initially filed Dec. 14 to correct mistakes
including rounding errors it said had no effect on net assets.  None of the revisions are significant, Yasutoshi Fujiwara,
a spokesman for Tokyo-based Olympus, said by phone. The company
filed 14 corrections to the Dec. 14 statement to the  finance
ministry  today.  Olympus made the errors in some tables so that the numbers
didn’t match with figures elsewhere in the report, while the
totals for debt, earned surplus and net assets were correct,
Olympus said in a statement. The company had delayed reporting
earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 pending the findings of
an independent investigation into a 13-year cover-up of
investment losses.  Olympus today reported figures showing the correct value of
its earned surplus as of April 2006 was reduced by 118.4 billion
yen, compared with the 117.3 billion yen reduction as stated in
some parts of its Dec. 14 filings.  Olympus shares rose 0.8 percent to close at 1,026 yen
before the announcement. The stock has lost almost 60 percent of
its value since the accounting scandal erupted with the Oct. 14
dismissal of former Chief Executive Officer  Michael Woodford ,
who challenged the company’s board over inflated takeover costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
