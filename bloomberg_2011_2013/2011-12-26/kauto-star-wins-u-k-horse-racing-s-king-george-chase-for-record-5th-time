Kauto Star made history today by
becoming the first horse to win racing’s King George VI Chase
for a record fifth time.  The 3-1 chance finshed a length and a quarter ahead of
even-money favorite Long Run, the horse that stopped Kauto
Star’s attempt to make it five straight wins in the race last
year.  The victory was the 23rd for Kauto Star in 40 races.  To contact the reporter on this story:
