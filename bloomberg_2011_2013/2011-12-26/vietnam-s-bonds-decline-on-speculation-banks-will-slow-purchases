Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell on
speculation banks will slow debt purchases as they hoard cash to
meet fund requirements ahead of the year-end and the Lunar New
Year that falls on Jan. 23. The dong weakened.  “Bonds dropped as most banks have to reserve cash for
consumers’ holiday spending,” said Ho Chi Minh City-based
Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at Viet Capital Securities.  Yields  on five-year debt rose eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 12.57 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That is the highest level
since August.  The dong fell 0.3 percent to 21,036 per dollar as of 4:00
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828, its website
showed. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
