The Bovespa stock index fell for the
first day in three sessions as economists cut their 2011  Brazil 
growth forecast for a fifth straight week.  Natura Cosmeticos SA , Brazil’s biggest cosmetics maker,
tumbled the most in three weeks.  Lojas Americanas SA  led losses
by retailers after a report showed Christmas sales slowed in
Brazil from a year earlier.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge slid 0.1 percent to
57,669.48 at the close of trading in Sao Paulo. Thirty-one
stocks advanced on the index, while 31 declined. The real
weakened 0.1 percent to 1.8582 per  U.S. dollar .  “The outlook for the economy isn’t very bright, as signs
of a slowdown keep mounting,” Gustavo Mendonca, who helps
oversee 250 million reais ($135 million) as an economist at Oren
Investimentos, said by phone from  Rio de Janeiro . “The holidays
in  Europe  and in the U.S. reduced today’s trading volumes.”  Economists cut their forecast for economic growth this year
to 2.9 percent, from 2.92 percent, according to the median
forecast in a central bank survey of economists. Brazilian
consumer prices will increase 5.33 percent next year, less than
the 5.39 percent forecast the week earlier, today’s survey
showed.  Sales  Brazil’s retail sales in the week before Christmas
increased 2.8 percent from the year-earlier period, Serasa
Experian said today in an e-mailed statement. In the same period
last year, sales rose 16 percent from 2009, Serasa said.  Natura fell 1.4 percent to 36.13 reais. Lojas Americanas
dropped 1.1 percent to 14.68 reais.  Traders moved 1.29 billion reais in stocks in  Sao Paulo ,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a daily
average this year of 6.56 billion reais through Dec. 15,
according to data from the exchange.  The Bovespa entered a  bull market  in October after gaining
22 percent from a two-year low on Aug. 8 as interest-rate cuts
in Brazil and signs of progress in solving Europe’s debt crisis
buoyed demand for equities. The measure is still down 17 percent
this year on concern flagging global commodity demand and
quickening inflation will hurt corporate earnings growth.  The index trades at 10.2 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, in line with the ratio for MSCI Inc.’s measure of 21
developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
