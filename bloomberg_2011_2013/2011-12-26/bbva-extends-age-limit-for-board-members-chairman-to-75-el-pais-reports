Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
extended an age limit for its board members to 75, a step that
may enable its Chairman  Francisco Gonzalez  to extend his tenure,
El Pais reported.  The bank took the decision to extend the age limit at its
board meeting on Dec. 20, the newspaper said Dec. 24. The
extension of the previous age limit of 70 years may allow
Gonzalez, now 67, to remain in his post until 2020, El Pais
said.  A spokeswoman for the bank, who asked not to be named in
line with company policy, declined to comment.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
