Turkey  and Azerbaijan signed an
agreement to build a pipeline to carry natural gas to  Europe 
from the  Caspian region  at a cost of about 7 billion euros ($9.2
billion).  The Trans-Anatolia pipeline will have a capacity of 16
billion cubic meters a year and cross 2,000 kilometers (1,240
miles), according to documents distributed before the signing
ceremony in Ankara today. The first delivery of gas is planned
for 2017.  State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan will work with Turkeyâ€™s state-
owned pipeline operator Botas Boru Hatlari Ile Petrol Tasima AS
and oil firm Turkiye Petrolleri AO to build the link. Socar, as
the Azeri company is known, will hold 80 percent of the venture,
Turkish Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said at the ceremony.  The pipeline may be linked with Nabucco, the OMV AG-led
project designed to bring Caspian gas to Europe, Yildiz said
last month. Azerbaijan will decide within a month on requests
from European countries for gas from the Shah Deniz II project
to be shipped through Nabucco, Azerbaijan Energy Minister Natig Aliyev said in Ankara today.  Azerbaijan can also supply Nabucco from other gas fields,
Aliyev said.  Turkey plans to draw gas from the Trans-Anatolia project,
supplying cities in the west of the country, Yildiz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
