Elektroprivreda Srbije,  Serbia ’s
power monopoly, will probably break even this year after
electricity imports in the fourth quarter offset gains over the
first three,  Tanjug  reported.  The imports, due to falling output at domestic hydro plants
because of drought, cost more than what the state-owned company
can charge its consumers, the newswire reported, citing General
Manager Dragomir Markovic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
