Colombia ’s peso gained as
speculation the  U.S. economy  will continue to recover and
higher-than-forecast third-quarter growth in the South American
country helped boost demand for the nation’s financial assets.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 1,924 per  U.S. dollar  in the
next-day market, according to the stock exchange’s foreign-
exchange electronic transactions system, known as SET-FX. With
markets closed in the U.S., Colombia’s currency trades in the
so-called next-day market, in which payment and delivery are
made the following trading day.  “Investors have kept the optimism brought on by last
week’s good news,” said Daniel Velandia, head of research at
Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA. Trading volume is low today
in Colombian markets given the U.S. holiday, he said.  Orders for U.S. durable goods rose in November by 3.8
percent, the most in four months, and more than the 2.2 percent
economists had predicted, data from the Commerce Department
showed Dec. 23 in  Washington . A report last week showed sales of
new U.S. homes rose 1.6 percent to a 315,000 annual pace in
November, a seven-month high. The U.S. is Colombia’s biggest
trading partner, buying about 40 percent of the South American
nation’s exports.  Colombia’s economy expanded 7.7 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, the national statistics agency said
in a Dec. 22 report. The growth exceeded the estimates of all 30
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median forecast was for
an increase of 6 percent.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.64 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.037
centavo to 118.561 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
