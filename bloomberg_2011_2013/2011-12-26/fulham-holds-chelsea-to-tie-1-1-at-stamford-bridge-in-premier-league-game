Fulham held Chelsea 1-1 at Stamford
Bridge in the first of the day’s seven Premier League soccer
games.  Juan Mata  gave Chelsea the lead two minutes into the second
half before  Clint Dempsey  brought Fulham level in the 56th
minute with a close-range finish.  Fulham golakeeper David Stockdale pulled off a series of
saves in the dying minutes to thwart Chelsea’s push for a
winner.  The result leaves Chelsea in 4th position after 18 games, a
point behind 3rd-pace Spurs who’ve played two games fewer.
Fulham is 13th. Manchester City leads the 20-team league with 44
points from 17 games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
