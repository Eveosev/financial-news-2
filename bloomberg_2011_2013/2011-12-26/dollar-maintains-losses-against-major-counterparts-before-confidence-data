The dollar  maintained (DXY)  losses from
last week against most of its major counterparts on speculation
a report tomorrow will show U.S. consumer confidence rose to the
highest since July, damping demand for haven assets.  The euro held a drop against the yen before  Italy  auctions
as much as 20 billion euros ($26.1 billion) of bills and bonds
this week amid concern the region’s debt crisis is worsening.
The Australian and New Zealand dollars traded within 0.6 percent
of two-week highs on prospects Asian stocks will rise.  “The  U.S. economy  is resilient,” said Kengo Suzuki,
manager of the foreign-bond department in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-biggest listed bank by
market value. “Excessive pessimism has receded at the end of
the year, and what we’re seeing is some unwinding of safe-haven
buying of currencies like the dollar and yen.”  The dollar was little changed at $1.3041 per euro and 78.09
yen at 8:55 a.m. in  Tokyo  from last week. The euro traded at
101.83 yen from 101.86 on Dec. 23, when it dropped 0.2 percent.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners including the euro,
yen and pound, fell 0.2 percent last week.  Shares in  Asia  may advance after the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rose 0.9 percent and the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index gained 0.8
percent on Dec. 23.  Consumer Confidence  An  index  of consumer confidence in the U.S. rose to 58.6
this month from 56 in November, according to the median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The New York-based
Conference Board will report the figures.  Home prices  in 20 U.S. cities probably  declined  at a slower
pace in October. Property values dropped 3.2 percent from the
same month in 2010, the smallest year-over-year decrease since
January, according to a separate Bloomberg survey before
S&P/Case-Shiller releases the data tomorrow.  Italy will sell 9 billion euros of 179-day bills and as
much as 2.5 billion euros of zero 2013 bonds on Dec. 28. It will
auction on Dec. 29 bonds due in 2014, 2018, 2021 and 2022.  “Bad results at Italy’s auctions may put the euro under
selling pressure,” said Mizuho’s Suzuki. “We’re likely to see
tension heightening in Europe during the first quarter and it
wouldn’t be a surprise if the euro falls to $1.20.”  The Australian dollar was little changed at $1.0149. It
touched $1.0219 on Dec. 21, the highest since Dec. 12.  New
Zealand ’s dollar was at 77.42 U.S. cents from 77.44 on Dec. 23.
It reached 77.76 on Dec. 21, the most since Dec. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
