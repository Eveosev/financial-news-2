Gold rose in  London  as the dollar
declined against the euro, boosting the appeal of precious
metals as alternative assets.  Bullion has climbed 13 percent this year, on track for an
11th straight annual gain. Investors have increased purchases as
concerns that global growth will slow lifted demand for the
metal as a haven. Still, prices have dropped 1 percent since
Sept. 30, heading for the first quarterly decline in more than
three years.  “The market is somewhat range-bound,” Rich Ilczyszyn, the
chief market strategist and founder of Iitrader.com in Chicago,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Dec. 23. Prices may
“spring” higher next year as the dollar weakens, he said.  Gold for immediate delivery rose 60 cents to $1,606.95 an
ounce at 4:54 p.m.  New York  time. Silver declined less than 0.1
percent to $29.11 an ounce. The Comex in New York was closed for
the Christmas holiday.  The dollar fell as much as 0.3 percent against the euro
during holiday trading today.  “Even though there are signs of a recovery in the  U.S.
economy , European economic concerns still do exist and many
issues require clarity and direction,” Reena Walia Nair, senior
analyst at Angel Commodities Broking Pvt., said by telephone
from Mumbai. “There may be a relief rally in the beginning of
2012 and some  risk aversion  may creep in later.”  Gold production in  China , the world’s second-largest
jewelry market, gained 5 percent in the first 10 months of this
year to 290.752 metric tons, according to a statement from the
Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology . Output in
October was 31.750 tons, it said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
