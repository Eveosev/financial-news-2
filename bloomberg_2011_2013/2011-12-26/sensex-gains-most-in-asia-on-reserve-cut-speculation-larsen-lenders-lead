India ’s benchmark stock index rose
the most in  Asia  amid expectations the central bank may reduce
lenders’ reserve requirements to ease a cash crunch.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering company,
advanced 1.7 percent.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the biggest wireless
services provider, paced gains among its peers after the telecom
dispute tribunal put on hold a government order telling wireless
providers to end some roaming agreements.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, climbed 232.05,
or 1.5 percent, to 15,970.75 at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai,
the biggest gainer among major Asian benchmark indexes. The
gauge is still headed for its second-worst annual loss in more
than three decades on concern the seven interest-rate increases
by the nation’s central bank this year and the rupee’s decline
to a record will exacerbate the effects of  Europe ’s debt crisis
on corporate earnings.  “Most investors are expecting a cut in the  cash reserve
ratio ; the surprise could be if it is cut by 50 or 75 basis
points,” said Alex Mathews, head of research at Geojit BNP
Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi. “Positive data from
the U.S. is also helping our markets.”  India’s money-market rates hit a three-year high, fueling
expectations the central bank will cut reserve requirements for
the first time since 2009. The  rate  at which banks lend
overnight to one another jumped 428 basis points this year to
9.78 percent on Dec. 23, 128 basis points above the central
bank’s benchmark rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s
the widest premium since March. Standard Chartered Plc and ICICI
Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. predict the central bank will
cut the ratio by 50 basis points at 5.5 percent at its policy
review next month.  Slowdown  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of

developer, rose 1.3 percent to 196.55 rupees.  Asia’s third-largest economy may grow 7.25 percent to 7.75
percent in the financial year ending in March, less than the 9
percent estimated in February, India’s finance ministry said in
a Dec. 9 report as a record run of borrowing-cost increases has
curbed consumption. The economy grew 6.9 percent in the quarter
ended Sept. 30, the least in two years, and factory output fell
5.1 percent in October, the first contraction since 2009,
government data show.  The rupee advanced 0.4 percent to 52.76 a dollar today,
paring this year’s decline to 15 percent.  U.S. Data  Asian stocks climbed to the highest level in almost two
weeks as orders for U.S. durable goods and home sales gained,
bolstering confidence in the world’s biggest economy and the
earnings outlook for Asia’s exporters. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index added 0.3 percent. Markets from  Hong Kong  to Singapore,
the U.K. and the U.S. are closed today.  This year’s 22 percent slide in India’s Sensex means the
30-stock measure trades at 13.9 times estimated profit, down
from 21.5 times in March 2010 and near the lowest level since
May 2009. The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  is valued at 10.1
times after a 19 percent drop this year.  “We are very near to the bottom,” Sampath Reddy, who

price since Dec. 14.  Idea Cellular Ltd. (IDEA)  advanced 4.4 percent to
82.2 rupees and Reliance Communications Ltd. climbed 3.5 percent
to 69.5 rupees.  The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal will
hear Jan. 3 the cell-phone operators’ complaint against the
government’s halting of 3G roaming services agreements,
Bloomberg UTV reported Dec. 24. Bharti said last week that it
was “shocked” by a Department of Telecommunications order to
end the roaming agreements that permits companies to offer 3G
services where they don’t own spectrum.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the nation’s most valuable
company, increased 2 percent to 761 rupees, paring this year’s
decline to 28 percent. The government may tomorrow approve the
company’s $1.5 billion investment plan for developing four
