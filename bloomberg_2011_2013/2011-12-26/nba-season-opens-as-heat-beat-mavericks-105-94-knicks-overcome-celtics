LeBron James  scored 37 points as
the  Miami Heat  beat the  Dallas Mavericks  105-94 on opening
day of the National Basketball Association season.  James finished with 10 rebounds and six assists for the
Heat, who are favored to win the NBA title by Las Vegas
bookmakers.  Yesterday’s games began a NBA season that started 54 days
later than originally scheduled following a work stoppage
that yielded a new 10-year collective bargaining agreement
between the league and its players. The season was shortened
to 66 games per team from the typical 82.  In other NBA action,  Carmelo Anthony  hit a pair of free
throws with 16 seconds remaining to lead the  New York Knicks 
to a 106-104 victory over the  Boston Celtics .  Anthony scored 17 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter
and added eight rebounds for the Knicks. Rajon Rondo finished
with 31 points and 13 assists for the Celtics, who played
without an injured Paul Pierce.  The  Chicago Bulls , led by reigning league Most Valuable
Player Derrick Rose, beat the Los Angeles Lakers 88-87 on
Rose’s shot with 4.8 seconds remaining; the Oklahoma City
Thunder beat the Orlando Magic 97-89; and Chris Paul helped
the Los Angeles Clippers beat the Golden State Warriors 105-
86.  Vetoed Trade  Paul, who formerly played for the league-owned New
Orleans Hornets, was headed to the Lakers earlier this month
in a three-team trade with the  Houston Rockets . The deal was
vetoed by league Commissioner David Stern, bringing to light
potential conflicts of having a franchise owned by the
league’s other 29 owners and overseen by the league. Stern
later signed off on Paul’s trade to the Clippers, who like
the Lakers call the Staples Center their home.  The league locked out the players on July 1, leading to
a 161-day work stoppage that caused the NBA to shorten its
schedule for the second time in its 66-year history. A 1998-
99 lockout led to a 50-game season that began in February
1999.  The Heat, anchored by former league MVPs LeBron James
and  Dwyane Wade  as well as All-Star  Chris Bosh , are 2-1
favorites to claim the NBA championship this season,
according to Las Vegas Sports Consultants, which advises
Nevada sports books on setting gambling lines.  Title-Winning Odds  The Lakers are second-favorites at around 4-1, followed
by the Thunder (5-1), Bulls (6-1) and Mavericks (8-1), all
teams that were in action yesterday.  That the Mavericks are fifth-favorites to repeat as NBA
champions is only partially due to the fact that Tyson Chandler, who averaged 10.1 points and 9.4 rebounds per game
last season, left to join the Knicks, according to Andrew
Patterson, an oddsmaker for Las Vegas Sports Consultants.  “I don’t know if it’s the loss of Tyson Chandler or
more that people think the Mavericks just had a magical run
last season,” Patterson said in a telephone interview.  The Knicks, with Chandler joining All-Stars Amar’e Stoudemire and Anthony, are receiving title-winning odds from
15-1 to 20-1 at most sports books, as are the Clippers now
that Paul has joined All-Star  Blake Griffin , Patterson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
