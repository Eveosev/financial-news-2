Interest rates paid by banks in
 Chile  to borrow for short periods fell for a third day after the
central bank acted to mitigate a liquidity squeeze.  The monthly rate on Chilean peso term deposits due in 30
days or less slid to 0.5 percent, the lowest since Dec. 19, from
0.54 percent on Dec. 23, according to data from the Santiago
securities exchange. The rate on deposits due in 31 to 60 days
fell to 0.52 percent from 0.57 percent. The 30-day interbank
lending rate in pesos fell for a second day to 7.11 percent from
7.47 percent on Dec. 23 and 7.64 percent on Dec. 22, according
to the banking association.  The central bank opened last week a so-called repo window
allowing lenders to pawn assets for up to 91 days while the
 finance ministry  said it would auction dollar deposits. Bank
borrowing costs reached the highest since the aftermath of the
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy as lenders and
companies sought cash ahead of the year-end and on concern the
crisis in  Europe  could restrict access to credit.  The central bank’s measure “has worked,” said Felipe Alarcon, an economist at Banco de Credito & Inversiones in
Santiago. “This is more about containment than an attempt to
revert to normality. The problems in Europe that generated the
rate increase haven’t gone away.”  The monthly rate paid by Chilean financial institutions to
borrow between one and three months rose two basis points to
0.58 percent on Dec. 22, according to data from the bank
supervisor published by the central bank. The annualized rate on
the same debt climbed 24 basis points to 6.96 percent on Dec.
22, the highest since January 2009 and a spread of 171 basis
points versus the benchmark  interest rate .  Dollar Credit  The cost of borrowing dollars for between one and three
months rose 18 basis points to 1.73 percent on Dec. 22 from 1.55
percent a day earlier, according to central bank data.  Banco Santander Chile today paid a monthly rate of 0.53
percent to borrow for 79 days. On Dec. 23 it had paid 0.54
percent to borrow pesos for 18 days and on Dec. 22 it paid 0.60
percent to borrow for 17 days, according to data from the
Santiago exchange.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had
a $5.7 billion short position in the currency on Dec. 22, little
changed from a day earlier, according to central bank data.  Chile’s peso was little changed at 11:39 a.m. in Santiago.
It rose to 519.88 per  U.S. dollar  from 520.1 on Dec. 23. The
currency gained as much as 0.3 percent and weakened as much as
0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
