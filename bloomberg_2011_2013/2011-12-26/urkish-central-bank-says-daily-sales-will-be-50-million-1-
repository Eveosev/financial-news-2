Turkey ’s central bank said it plans
to sell $50 million a day in daily dollar sale auctions unless
there are “exceptional” circumstances, sparking speculation
that this year’s second worst performing currency may sink.  Starting Dec. 27 and lasting until the next monetary policy
committee meeting, the Ankara-based bank will aim to sell only
$50 million a day of a maximum two-day sale total of $1.7
billion, it said in an e-mailed statement today. The date of the
next monetary policy meeting hasn’t been announced.  The bank will sell more than $50 million if it’s required
for financial stability or circumstances are exceptional, it
said. The maximum sale for a single day will be $1.35 billion,
it said.  “The lira will remain under fundamental pressure in the
first six months” of 2012, Sertan Kargin, chief economist at
Eczacibasi Securities in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.
The central bank’s decision to sell $50 million “appears to be
correct in terms of predictability but the figure is
insufficient.”  “Turkey will need $200 billion financing next year and
that means $750-$800 million each working day,” said Kargin.  The lira has lost 18.3 percent this year against the dollar
in the second worst performance among more than 20 emerging
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg as its  current-account
deficit  and European debt crisis dented investor confidence in
the financial stability of the country and lira assets. The
currency traded 0.6 percent up at 1.8910 per dollar at 5:00 p.m.
in Istanbul.  The currency depreciated as much as 0.7 percent to 1.9030
on Dec. 23, near the record low of 1.9056 reached on Dec. 19,
after the central bank sold $50 million after offering as much
as $1.35 billion and receiving bids worth $1 billion. On Dec. 20
and 21, the bank sold what it offered, $350 million.  The Ankara-based bank has sold about $10.6 billion since
August to support the lira, the central bank website shows.
Turkey’s foreign-exchange reserves declined to $82.7 billion as
of Dec. 16, down from $84.4 billion in the previous week, data
from the bank showed.  “The market had been expecting hefty sales from the
central bank and this announcement caused disappointment,” said
Tufan Comert, a strategist at Garanti Securities in Istanbul,
said in e-mailed comments.  The bank will not hold an auction today due to a holiday in
the  United States .  To contact the reporter on this story:
