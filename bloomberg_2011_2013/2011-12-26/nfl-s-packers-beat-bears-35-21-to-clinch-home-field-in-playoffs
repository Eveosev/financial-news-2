Aaron Rodgers  threw five touchdown
passes as the Green Bay Packers beat the Chicago Bears 35-21 to
advance to 14-1 and clinch home field throughout the National
Football League playoffs.  Rodgers completed 21 of 29 passes for 283 yards for the
defending Super Bowl champions, including two touchdown passes
each to Jordy Nelson and  James Jones  and one to Jermicheal
Finley.  “A great night for us, securing that No. 1 seed,” Rodgers
said in a televised interview.  Chicago quarterback Josh McCown finished with 19
completions on 28 attempts for 242 yards with a touchdown and
two interceptions for the Bears, while running back Kahlil Bell
gained 121 yards on 23 carries.  The Bears fell to 7-8 with the loss, which eliminated
Chicago from postseason contention and guaranteed the  Atlanta
Falcons  a playoff spot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
