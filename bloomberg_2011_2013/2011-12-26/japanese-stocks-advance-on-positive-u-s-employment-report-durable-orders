Japanese  stocks  gained, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rising to its highest in nearly two
weeks, after U.S. unemployment claims unexpectedly dropped and
American lawmakers extended a tax cut.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker of industrial robots that earns 75
percent of its revenue overseas, gained 2.9 percent.  Mitsubishi
Corp. (8058) ,  Japan ’s biggest commodities trader by revenue, rose 1.7
percent after oil and metals prices increased.  Canon Inc. (7751) 
climbed 1.3 percent after the Nikkei newspaper said the camera
maker may pay a 120 yen dividend this year.  “The U.S. economic data is not bad on the whole,” said
 Yoshinori Nagano , a senior strategist in  Tokyo  at Daiwa Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $104 billion. “Congress
passed a two-month U.S. payroll  tax cut  extension, which reduced
concerns in the market because investors had worried the end of
the tax cut would likely weigh on January-March GDP.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 1 percent to 8,479.34 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, the highest since Dec. 14. The broader Topix
advanced 0.5 percent to 726.44, with trading volume 38 percent
below the 30-day average.  The  Topix  has fallen 19 percent this year amid concern U.S.
growth is sputtering and  Europe ’s debt crisis will damage the
banking system, damping demand in two of Japan’s biggest export
markets. The decline has cut the price of shares on the index to
0.87 times book value, near the lowest since March 2009.  Payroll Tax  Cut  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.9 percent in  New
York  on Dec. 23 as claims for  unemployment benefits  unexpectedly
dropped last week to the lowest since April 2008 and the  U.S.
Congress  passed a two-month extension of a  payroll tax cut  eight
days before it was due to expire.  “The worst-case scenario was avoided, and that was a
positive for  stocks (TPX) ,” said Naoki Murakami, chief economist at
Monex Group Inc. in Tokyo.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. cited the tax
cut extension as a positive for the economy. JPMorgan raised its
estimate for U.S. growth to 2.5 percent in 2012 from an earlier
projection of a 1.9 percent rise.  Commodity prices gained on speculation an economic recovery
in the U.S. may spur demand for oil and industrial metals. Crude
oil for February delivery gained 0.2 percent to $99.68 a barrel
in New York on Dec. 23, the highest settlement since Dec. 13.
The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six industrial
commodities including copper and aluminum rose 0.7 percent.  Turnover on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange
fell to 500.8 billion yen ($6.4 billion) today, the lowest on a
full-day basis since May 27, 2003.  The following are among the most active shares in the
