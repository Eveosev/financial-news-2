Yields on benchmark Mexican local
bonds dropped to the lowest in three weeks as signals the  U.S.
economy  is improving boosted the outlook for the Latin American
country’s exports.  The yield on the peso-denominated bond due in 2024 fell two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.48 percent at 9:16
a.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the lowest since Nov. 30. The price of the security rose
0.17 centavo to 130.83 centavos per peso.  Reports tomorrow may show home prices in 20 U.S. cities
declined at a slower pace and consumer confidence in the world’s
biggest economy reached a five-month high. Improving data from
the U.S., the destination of about 80 percent of Mexican
exports, is helping fuel the bond rally, said Gerardo Welsh, a
bond trader at Base Internacional Casa de Bolsa in Monterrey,
 Mexico .  “This has helped compensate for the negative out of
 Europe ,” Welsh said in a telephone interview. The U.S. economic
data “has helped diminish the risk factors a little bit.”  The peso was little changed at 13.8448 per  U.S. dollar . Its
10.9 percent decline in 2011 is the most among Latin America’s
major currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
