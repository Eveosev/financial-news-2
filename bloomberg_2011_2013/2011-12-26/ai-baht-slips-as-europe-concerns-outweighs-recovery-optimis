Thailand’s baht slid for a third day
as concerns over Europe’s ability to overcome its debt crisis
offset U.S. economic data that indicated the recovery of the
world’s biggest economy remains intact.  The  European Central Bank  won’t become the lender of last
resort for governments struggling to finance their debt,
Governing Council member Ignazio Visco said in an interview with
Il Sole 24-Ore newspaper.  Stock indexes (MXAP)  rose across Asia after
U.S. economic data last week showed that durable-goods orders
and new-home sales rose in November.  “The fact that a big rally in the U.S. last week didn’t
translate into massive gains in Asia today means investors are
not that convinced the world economy is on the right track,”
said  Henry Lin , a Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at Taiwan
Shin Kong Commercial. “The currency remains range-bound and
will continue to swing between gains and losses because of the
low volumes.”  The baht fell 0.2 percent to 31.36 per dollar from last
week as of 3:16 p.m. local time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has lost 4.4 percent this year.  Government bonds  dropped. The yield on the 5.25 percent
debt due May 2014 rose ten basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to 3.1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
