Saudi Arabia ’s benchmark stock index
gained to the highest level in almost five months ahead of a
budget report by the Arab world’s largest economy.  Yamamah Saudi Cement Co. (YACCO) , the kingdom’s third-largest
cement company by market value, and  Yanbu Cement Co. (YNCCO)  rallied to
the highest level in more than three years. The  Tadawul All
Share Index (SASEIDX)  rose 0.5 percent to 6,414.47 at the 3:30 p.m. close
in Riyadh, the highest level since Aug. 3. The gauge has
advanced 5.1 percent so far this month. Bahrain’s  measure (BHSEASI)  rose
the most since March, gaining 1.3 percent.  “Volumes on the Tadawul are climbing up in the final days
of 2011,” said Asim Bukhtiar, an equity analyst at Riyad
Capital. “The anticipated budget announcement and year-end
positioning are the contributing factors.”  Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, is expected to
announce as early as today its budget for 2012, said Turki Fadaak, head of research at Riyadh-based Albilad Investment Co.
King Abdullah announced a $130 billion spending plan in the
first quarter in response to the spread of unrest in the Middle
East.  About 260 million shares were  traded  on the Tadawul today,
compared with a six-month daily average of 176 million shares.
Yamamah gained 2.8 percent to 72.50 riyals, the highest since
July 2008. Yanbu Cement surged 4.3 percent to 66.25 riyals, the
highest since August 2008.  Aldar Declines  Oil in  New York  capped its biggest weekly gain in two
months. Crude oil for February delivery rose 15 cents to $99.68
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on Dec. 23, the
highest settlement since Dec. 13.  The Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia
and Qatar, is home to about one-fifth of the world’s proven
reserves.  Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  gained 0.1 percent and Abu
Dhabi’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  climbed less than 0.1 percent.  Aldar
Properties PJSC (ALDAR) , an Abu Dhabi-based real-estate developer,
dropped 2.4 percent, the biggest decrease since Dec. 21, to 83
fils after the company said its board will meet on Dec. 28 to
discuss the sale of unspecified assets.  “The appetite to hold or buy local shares has taken a
serious hit as markets repeatedly failed to convert rallies to
sustainable uptrend,” said Vipin Karnani, a financial analyst
at Al Fahim Group in Abu Dhabi. “Traders have no reason to
increase activity in local stocks.”  The  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200)  rose less than 0.1 percent.
Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  rose 0.5 percent. Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  retreated
0.4 percent and Kuwait’s  gauge (KWSEIDX)  slid less than 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
