An 11-day strike by French airport-
security personnel is over after employers and four unions
signed an agreement on new pay and working conditions, the
Transport Ministry said in a statement.  “This accord will allow air traffic to resume in the best
possible conditions following Christmas,” the statement said.
The strike led to delays and some flight cancellations, above
all at Lyon’s airport and at terminal 2 of Paris’ Charles de
Gaulle airport.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
