Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and state-run
Turkiye Petrolleri AO terminated exploration work for oil and
natural gas at two areas in the Black Sea, Turkey’s state-owned
Anatolia News Agency said.  The Deepwater Champion, a rig owned by  Transocean Ltd. (RIG) ,
left the Kastamonu-1 and Surmeli-1 sites to explore instead off
Romania’s Black Sea coast, the agency said, without saying where
it obtained the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
