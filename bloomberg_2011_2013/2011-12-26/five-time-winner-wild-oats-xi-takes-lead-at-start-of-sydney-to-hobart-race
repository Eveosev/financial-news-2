Five-time line honors winner Wild
Oats XI led the 88-boat fleet at the start of sailing’s Sydney
to Hobart race, even after its mainsail winch failed 11 minutes
before the start.  The crew of the 100-foot supermaxi, owned by millionaire
Bob Oatley and skippered by Mark Richards, managed to get the
winch back online and the yacht pulled ahead of its nearest
rival Investec Loyal as they approached the Sydney Heads,
according to the race  website .  Wild Oats XI last year claimed its fifth line honors
victory from six starts after the dismissal of a protest lodged
by the race committee alleging a breach of rules by failing to
have an operational radio as it entered Bass Strait. This year
is the 67th edition of the race that takes competitors down
 Australia ’s southeast coast and across Bass Strait to the island
state of Tasmania.  Three years ago, Wild Oats XI became the first boat to beat
the fleet to Hobart four years in a row. It finished as the 2009
runner-up to  New Zealand ’s Alfa Romeo.  The record for most line honors wins is held by
Morna/Kurrewa IV, which sailed to seven victories under two
different owners and two different names, the last time in 1960
as Kurrewa IV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
