Philippine bonds fell for a second
straight day on speculation traders are locking in gains ahead
of the year-end amid concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis could
worsen.  The yield on the nation’s 10-year notes has dropped 50
basis points this month as the central bank said cooling
inflation may prompt an easing of monetary policy next year. The
peso snapped a four-day advance after  European Central Bank 
governing council member Ignazio Visco said the monetary
authority won’t become the lender of last resort for governments
struggling to finance their debt.  “Some people want to lock in gains before the year ends to
protect profits because there are still a lot of worries from
Europe,” said Angeline Sia, a fixed-income trader who helps
manage the equivalent of $15 billion at BPI Asset Management
Inc. in  Manila .  The yield on the 5.75 percent bonds due October 2021 rose
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.17 percent as
of 3:15 p.m. in Manila, according to Amstel Financial Services.  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 43.585 per dollar, according
to Tullett Prebon Plc.  “It’s not in the nature of a central bank to be the
ultimate financier of the state,” the Italian newspaper Il Sole
24-Ore cited the ECB’s Visco as saying last week. “That role
isn’t permitted in the European treaty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
