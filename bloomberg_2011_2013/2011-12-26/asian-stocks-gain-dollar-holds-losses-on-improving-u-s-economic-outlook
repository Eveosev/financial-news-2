Most stocks (MXAP)  climbed, helping the
MSCI All Country World Index gain for a fifth day, while the
dollar maintained losses against higher-yielding peers amid
speculation the U.S. economy will continue to recover. China’s
yuan surged to a 17-year high.  MSCI’s  global index  advanced less than 0.1 percent at 4:51
p.m. in  New York  as equity gauges in Japan,  India ,  Russia  and
Mexico rose 0.5 percent or more. About four shares  advanced  for
every three that declined on the global benchmark, helping it
extend last week’s 3.1 percent advance.  Financial markets from  Hong Kong  to the U.K. and the U.S.
were closed for holidays. The dollar weakened 0.1 percent to
$1.3059 per euro amid reduced demand for haven assets. The yuan 
touched 6.3160 versus the greenback, the strongest level since 
1993, on speculation China’s policy makers will tolerate 
appreciation to stem capital outflows.  Reports tomorrow may show home prices in 20 U.S. cities
declined at a slower pace and  consumer confidence  improved to a
five-month high. Data last week showed durable goods orders
jumped in November by the most in four months, while sales of
new homes increased to a seven-month high.  “The  U.S. economy  is improving more than expected,” said
Hideyuki Ishiguro, assistant manager at the investment strategy
department at Okasan Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “Pessimism is
easing among American consumers due to a recovery in the job
market and some stability in the stock market.”  Latin American Stocks  Mexico’s IPC advanced 0.5 percent.  Brazil ’s Bovespa index
slid 0.1 percent as economists cut their 2011 forecasts for a
fifth straight week.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 1 percent, the BSE
India Sensitive Index jumped 1.5 percent, while Russia’s Micex
Index gained 1 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751)  climbed 1.3 percent after the
Nikkei newspaper reported that the camera maker may pay a 120
yen ($1.54) dividend this year.  The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index of Persian Gulf shares rose
less than 0.1 percent to 54.89 while Israel’s TA-25 index gained
0.7 percent.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  added 0.9 percent on Dec. 23, erasing its
losses for this year, after Commerce Department data showed
orders for goods meant to last at least three months rose 3.8
percent in November. A separate report showed purchases of
single-family properties increased 1.6 percent to a 315,000
annual pace, while  consumer spending  rose less than forecast in
November as wages declined for the first time in three months.  Consumer Confidence  Property values probably dropped 3.2 percent in October from
the same month in 2010, the smallest year-over-year decrease
since January, according to the  median forecast  of 20 economists
before a report from S&P/Case-Shiller. Consumer confidence may
have climbed to a five-month high of 58.6 in December from 56
last month, a separate survey  showed  before tomorrow’s report
from the New York-based Conference Board.  “Excessive pessimism has receded at the end of the year,
and what we’re seeing is some unwinding of safe-haven buying of
currencies like the dollar and yen,” said Kengo Suzuki, manager
of the foreign-bond department in Tokyo at Mizuho Securities
Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-biggest listed bank by market
value. “The U.S. economy is resilient.”  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six trading partners, fell less than 0.1 percent after
sliding last week. The Australian dollar rose 0.2 percent to
$1.0169 and Turkey’s lira gained 0.5 percent to 1.8926 per
dollar.  Yuan Gains  The yuan strengthened 0.3 percent to 6.3198 per dollar as
the central bank set the reference rate 0.07 percent higher at
6.3167 per dollar. A depreciation of the yuan may fuel outflows
of capital, Yi Xianrong, a researcher at the Institute of
Finance and Banking that is affiliated to the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, wrote in a commentary in the  China  Daily.  Japan and China will promote direct trading of yen and yuan
without using dollars and will encourage the development of a
market for companies involved in the exchanges, the Japanese
government said at a meeting between Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in Beijing yesterday.  Gold for immediate delivery retreated as much as 0.5
percent to $1,597.75 an ounce before trading at $1,606.90 an
ounce. Copper declined 1.2 percent to 55,200 yuan ($8,735) a
metric ton in Shanghai, the first retreat in five days. The
