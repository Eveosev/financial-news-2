Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) ’s Ugandan unit
plans to stop connecting phone calls with rival  Uganda  Telecom
Ltd. over a 10 billion-shilling ($3.55 million) debt, the  Daily
Monitor  reported, citing the industry regulator.  Airtel said it would suspend calls between the two networks
from Sept. 5 after Uganda Telecom failed to repay the money,
which accumulated from unpaid fees from September 2008 to
September 2009, the Kampala-based newspaper said, citing Uganda
Communication Commission Executive Director Godfrey Mutabazi.  The suspension will be called off if Uganda Telecom pays at
least 6.5 billion shillings of the debt, it said, citing Dennis
Kakonge, Airtel’s legal director.  Uganda’s government is trying to mediate an end to the
dispute, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
