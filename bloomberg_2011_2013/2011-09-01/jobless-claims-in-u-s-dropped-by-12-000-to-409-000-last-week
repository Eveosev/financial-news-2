Applications for U.S. unemployment
benefits fell last week as the influence of the strike at
Verizon Communications Inc. waned.  Jobless claims fell by 12,000 to 409,000 in the week ended
Aug. 27, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a drop to
410,000, according to the median forecast. The figure remains
higher than it was three weeks earlier, before the labor dispute
at Verizon pushed the numbers up.  Companies like  American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC)  are stepping
up job cuts, which may prompt consumers to pull back on the
spending that accounts for about 70 percent of the economy. A
report tomorrow may show employers added 70,000 workers to
payrolls in August, down from 117,000 the prior month, and the
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  “Claims are still quite elevated, which shows the U.S. job
market remains very soft,” said Jennifer Lee, a senior
economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto, who had forecast
claims would drop to 408,000. “There’s still a lot of
nervousness about how the global economy is playing out. Growth
in the U.S. is not enough to bring down the unemployment rate
significantly.”  Jobless benefits applications were projected to fall from
the 417,000 initially reported for the prior week, according to
the median forecast of 46 economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Estimates ranged from 400,000 to 420,000.  Treasuries rose and stocks fell after the report. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.1 percent to 1,217.67 at
9:32 a.m. in  New York . The yield on the benchmark 10-year note
fell to 2.20 percent from 2.22 percent late yesterday.  Nothing Special  There were no special circumstances affecting last week’s
claims data, a Labor Department spokesman said as the figures
were released, adding that there was no indication that striking
workers at Verizon influenced the numbers.  The number of jobless claims stood at 399,000 in the period
ended Aug. 5, the week before some of the roughly 45,000 workers
on strike at Verizon started filing for benefits.  A second report from the Labor Department today showed the
productivity of U.S. workers fell more than previously estimated
in the second quarter, pushing up labor costs from 2010’s record
low. The measure of employee output per hour decreased at a 0.7
percent annual rate, the second straight quarterly drop, revised
figures showed. Expenses per employee climbed at a 3.3 percent
rate.  Four-Week Average  Today’s data showed the four-week moving average, a less-
volatile measure than the weekly figures, rose to 410,250 last
week from 408,500.  The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits
fell by 18,000 in the week ended Aug. 20 to 3.74 million. The
prior week’s reading was revised up to 3.75 million from a prior
estimate of 3.64 million.  The continuing claims figure does not include the number of
Americans receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments increased by about
38,000 to 3.68 million in the week ended Aug. 13.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits
held at 3 percent in the week ended Aug. 20, today’s report
showed.  States, Territories  Twenty-seven states and territories reported a decrease in
claims, while 26 reported an increase. These data are reported
with a one-week lag.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Tomorrow’s forecast gain in payrolls would compare with
117,000 in July which brought the average increase over the past
three months to 111,000. That was about half the 204,000
increase on average in the first four months of the year.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , speaking at the
annual central bank symposium last week in  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming , said the Fed still had tools at its disposal to
stimulate the economy even as he declined to specify which
measures it might use.  Fed’s Bernanke  “It is clear that the recovery from the crisis has been
much less robust than we had hoped,” Bernanke said. “Economic
growth has, for the most part, been at rates insufficient to
achieve sustained reductions in unemployment.”  Job cuts have accelerated as recent data showed the economy
slowed more than previously reported in the first half of the
year. American Superconductor, a global power technologies
company, announced Aug. 11 that it plans to cut about 150 jobs
to better align costs with revenue expectations.  “These workforce reductions are necessary to maintain the
health of the business,” said Daniel McGahn, chief executive
officer of the Devens, Massachusetts-based company. “Expenses
have been reduced in virtually all departments, levels and major
geographies.”  Solyndra Inc., a maker of solar modules that received a
$535 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department,
dismissed 1,100 employees this week as it suspended operations,
citing economic and industry conditions. Fremont, California-
based Solyndra said it will seek Chapter 11 protection.  “Regulatory and policy uncertainties in recent months
created significant near-term excess supply and price erosion,”
Solyndra’s President and Chief Executive Officer Brian Harrison
said in a statement Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
