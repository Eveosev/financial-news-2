Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are a
model for European countries that are suffering from a debt
crisis,  DnB NOR ASA (DNBNOR) ’s Chief Executive Officer Rune Bjerke said,
according to the Latvian magazine  Ir .  In 2009 there were worries that the Baltic states had the
potential to set off a crisis in central Europe, when no one was
speaking about Spain,  Portugal , Italy,  Greece  or Ireland, the
Riga-based magazine quoted Bjerke as saying.  “I perceive signs of optimism in the Baltic states which
are very hard to find in other countries,” he said, Ir
reported. Growth in the Baltic states could be 5 percent this
year and more than 3 percent in 2012 and 2013, he said.  Bjerke said the chances of the euro’s survival were
“strongly greater than 50 percent,” the magazine reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
