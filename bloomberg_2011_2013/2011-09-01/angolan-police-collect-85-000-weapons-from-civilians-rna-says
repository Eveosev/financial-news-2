Angolan police have collected 85,000
weapons from civilians as part of a disarmament plan that began
in 2009, Radio Nacional de Angola reported, citing Paulo de
Almeida, the deputy commander of the police public order unit.  De Almeida said he believed there was still a “large
number” of weapons in the hands of civilians following an
almost three-decade civil war that ended in 2002, the state-
owned radio station said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
