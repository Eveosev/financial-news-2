Hungary will announce tax increases
next week and plans to delay some spending as part of a plan to
meet this year’s budget targets amid slower-than-forecast
economic growth, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said.  The tax increases will affect alcohol, tobacco and
gambling, Orban said in a  TV2 interview  today. The measures will
be approved Sept. 5 or 6 and will be announced Sept. 7, he said.  Hungary must close a budget gap of “at least” 100 billion
forint ($523 million) after the government revised its 2011
growth to about 2 percent from 3.1 percent, Orban said Aug. 17.
The economy stalled in the second quarter as industrial output
petered out amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis and slower growth
in the U.S. and  China  will derail the global recovery.  “There will be a few taxes that we will increase, such as
gambling, alcohol and cigarette,” Orban told TV2. “We are
going to increase taxes linked with expenditures that aren’t the
most important in life and we are putting a stop to all spending
that doesn’t need to be done this year.”  Hungary is targeting a budget shortfall of 2.5 percent of
gross domestic product next year, compared with 4.3 percent in
2010, and a 2011 surplus after the effective nationalization of
private-pension funds and temporary taxes on the energy,
financial-services, retail and telecommunications industries.  To contact the reporters on this story:
