the introduction of joint euro bonds,  Handelsblatt  reported on
its website today, citing comments made by Fitschen at a
conference with  Germany ’s Free Democratic Party today.  Joint euro bonds would be a way to get the current currency
crisis under control and restore confidence in the financial
markets, Fitschen said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
