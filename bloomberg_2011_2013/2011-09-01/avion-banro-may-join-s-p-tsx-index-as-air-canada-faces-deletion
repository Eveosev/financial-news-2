Avion Gold Corp. (AVR)  and  Banro Corp. (BAA)  may
be added to the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index while four
companies including  Air Canada (AC/A)  are likely to be dropped from the
benchmark index, according to UBS AG.  The change in  Canada ’s stock benchmark may be announced
after the market’s close on Sept. 9 following a quarterly
review.  Eastern Platinum Ltd. (ELR) ,  Perpetual Energy Inc. (PMT)  and Transat
A.T. Inc. are also candidates for deletion, UBS said in a note
to clients today.  The addition of Avion and Banro, both based in Toronto,
would boost the number of gold producers in the S&P/TSX to 39,
according to Bloomberg Data. The precious metal is in the 11th
year of a  bull market , the longest winning streak since at least
1920 in  London , as investors seek to diversify away from
equities and some currencies.  The S&P/TSX fell 5 percent through yesterday this year amid
concern a recovery in the global economy is slowing. Raw-
materials companies make up 24 percent of the benchmark gauge,
the third-biggest industry after financial and energy companies.  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , a tree-plantation company that’s being
accused of exaggerating timber holdings, will be removed after
the close of trading on Sept. 16, S&P said on Aug. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
