James Murdoch,  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s deputy
chief operating officer, canceled a Hong Kong speech scheduled
on the same day as former executives at a company unit will
answer questions from U.K. lawmakers on phone hacking.  Murdoch won’t attend the Asia Media Summit conference in
order to focus on events in the U.K., News Corp. spokeswoman
Alice Macandrew said today in an e-mail. Murdoch had been due to
speak on Sept. 6.  The former executives will appear that same day at a
parliamentary committee to explain why their evidence
contradicted statements made by Murdoch over the extent of phone
hacking at the now defunct News of the World Sunday tabloid.  Tom Crone, a former lawyer for News of the World, and  Colin Myler , the newspaper’s last editor, said they informed  James
Murdoch  in 2008 about an e-mail that suggested more reporters
had been involved. Murdoch joined News International as chairman
in December 2007, after the alleged hacking took place.  The News of the World has been accused of hacking into the
voicemails messages of a murdered school girl, celebrities,
sports athletes and politicians. Murdoch told lawmakers in July
that he hadn’t realized until late 2010 that phone hacking was
widespread at the tabloid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
