Czech manufacturing growth showed
the strongest increase in production for three months, an
industry gauge showed, stopping a quarter of declines amid
faltering momentum in business.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing Purchasing Managers
Index compiled by Markit was unchanged at 53.4 in August,
remaining at the lowest level since January 2010, the bank said
today in an e-mailed report.  A PMI reading greater than 50 signals overall growth. HSBC
said the overall PMI figure “masked faster gains in both new
orders and output.”  “Output growth in the Czech manufacturing sector recovered
some positive momentum in August,” the report said. “Renewed
momentum in order books drove faster production growth in
August.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
