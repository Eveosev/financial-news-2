Global sugar supply will exceed
demand in the season starting Oct. 1 after a balanced market in
the current period and deficits in the prior two crop years, the
 International Sugar Organization  said.  Supply will top consumption by 4.2 million metric tons in
the coming season, the London-based ISO said in a report e-
mailed today. Output will climb to a record 172.4 million tons
even as top producer  Brazil  registers a drop, it said. The
supply estimate represents a 4 percent increase from the current
period, the report showed.  “Losses in export availability in Brazil are likely to be
counterbalanced by higher deliveries by a number of key
exporters and India, in particular,” the ISO said.  Sugar production in the South American country will drop
2.9 million tons to 35.9 million tons on lower yields, the ISO
said. Output in  India , the second-largest producer and biggest
consumer, will rise 2.05 million tons to about 28 million tons,
according to the report. India may export as much as 4 million
tons in the coming season, it showed.  Global consumption will rise 2 percent, or 3.32 million
tons, to 168.2 million tons in the 2011-12 season as usage
increases in the  Indian subcontinent , the ISO said.  Raw sugar traded in  New York  and refined sweetener listed
in London climbed for three years in a row through 2010. Low
stockpiles mean prices are likely to be stable in the coming
season even amid the projected surplus, according to the ISO.
Further gains are “unlikely,” it said.  White, or refined, sugar for October delivery slid $9.20,
or 1.2 percent, to $761.60 a ton by 4:53 p.m. on NYSE Liffe. Raw
sugar for October delivery was unchanged at 29.68 cents a pound
