The pound fell for a third day
against the dollar as a report showed  house prices  unexpectedly
dropped, adding to signs the U.K.’s economic recovery is
faltering and strengthening the case for record-low  interest
rates .  Sterling traded within a penny of its weakest level in
three weeks against the euro. The average price of a house fell
0.6 percent last month, after increasing by a revised 0.3
percent in July,  Nationwide Building Society  said in a statement
today. The median prediction of nine economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for prices to be stagnant. GfK NOP Ltd. said
yesterday an index of consumer sentiment slipped this month.  The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.6232 at 9:02 a.m. in
London, extending last month’s 1.1 percent decline. Sterling was
at 88.10 pence per euro, after depreciating yesterday to 88.85
pence, the weakest level since Aug. 10. The euro lost 0.5
percent to $1.4305.  U.K. government bonds rose, with the 10-year gilt yield
falling two basis points to 2.58 percent, after rising to 2.64
percent, the highest since Aug. 10. The 3.75 percent security
due September 2020 rose 0.170 or 1.70 pounds per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 109.335. Two-year yields fell two basis points
to 0.57 percent.  Gilts have handed investors a 7.2 percent return in 2011,
compared with 5.2 percent from German debt and 7.2 percent from
U.S. Treasuries, according to the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Gilts gained 2.7 percent in
August, the indexes show.  Britain plans to sell 3 billion pounds of 3.75 percent
bonds maturing in 2021 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
