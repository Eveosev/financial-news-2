Spain sold 3.62 billion euros ($5.2
billion) of five-year bonds, near the maximum target, and its
borrowing costs fell at its first bond auction since the
 European Central Bank  started buying its debt.  The Treasury said it sold the bonds at an average yield of
4.489 percent, compared with 4.871 percent on July 7, the last
time it auctioned a bond maturing in 2016. Demand for the
securities was 1.76 times the amount sold, down from 2.85 in
July. The Treasury had set a maximum target of 4 billion euros
for the sale.  “These auctions we think consistently now are likely to be
tepid affairs,”  Harvinder Sian , an interest rate strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in  London . “It’s unrealistic at
these prices to expect to have engineered some sort of strong
investor demand for this paper.”  The yield on  Spain ’s benchmark 10-year bond rose after the
auction, gaining 7 basis points to 5.11 percent, the highest
since the day the ECB began buying Spanish debt on Aug. 8. The
gap between Spanish and German 10-year yields widened 9 basis
points to 291 basis points.  The ECB started buying Italian and Spanish bonds as the
sovereign-debt crisis threatened to engulf the euro region’s
third- and fourth-biggest economies. As part of policy makers’
efforts to stem the surge in borrowing costs, both countries
agreed to take additional austerity steps and enact balanced-
budget laws. Spain’s parliament is set to vote on an amendment
of its constitution tomorrow to include a “principle of budget
stability.”  The ECB spent 6.65 billion euros on  government bonds  last
week, down from 14.3 billion euros the week before, as its
initial purchases helped bring down Italian and Spanish 10-year
yields from euro-era highs to around 5 percent.  Spain’s parliament approved further austerity measures
worth 3.1 billion euros on Aug. 23, bringing forward corporate-
tax receipts and reducing health spending. The Socialist
government, which has already cut public wages, raised taxes and
frozen pensions last year, applied the additional measures as it
tries to cut the deficit to 6 percent of gross domestic product
this year from 9.2 percent last year.  The belt-tightening has fueled a popular backlash that
polls suggest will return the opposition  People’s Party  to power
at the next general election on Nov. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
