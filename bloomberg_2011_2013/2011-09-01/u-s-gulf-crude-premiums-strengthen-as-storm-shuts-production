after producers began shutting production as a low-pressure
system in the  Gulf of Mexico  threatened to grow into a storm.  About 5.7 percent of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico
is shut as the area of thunderstorms that may become Tropical

there, the company said in a posting on its website.  Murphy Oil

essential workers, Barry Jeffery, a company spokesman, said in
an e-mail.  BP Plc said it will remove all workers from Gulf platforms
by tomorrow.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 75 cents to $30.25 a barrel
