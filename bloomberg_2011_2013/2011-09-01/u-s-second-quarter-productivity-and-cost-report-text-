The following is the text of the
U.S. productivity and costs report for the revised second
quarter released by the Labor Department.  Nonfarm business sector labor productivity decreased at
a 0.7 percent annual rate during the second quarter of 2011,
the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today, with
output and hours worked rising 1.3 percent and 2.0 percent,
respectively. (All quarterly percent changes in this release
are seasonally adjusted annual rates.) From the second
quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2011, output
increased 2.4 percent while hours rose 1.6 percent, yielding
an increase in productivity of 0.7 percent.  Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by
dividing an index of real output by an index of hours worked
of all persons, including employees, proprietors, and unpaid
family workers.  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses rose 3.3 percent
in the second quarter of 2011, because hourly compensation
increased 2.7 percent while productivity decreased 0.7
percent. Over the last four quarters, hourly compensation
increased more than output per hour, and unit labor costs
rose 1.9 percent.  BLS defines unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly
compensation to  labor productivity ; increases in hourly
compensation tend to increase unit labor costs and increases
in output per hour tend to reduce them.  Manufacturing sector productivity fell 1.5 percent in
the second quarter of 2011, as output rose 1.2 percent and
hours increased 2.7 percent. Productivity declined 2.7
percent in the durable goods sector and increased 1.3 percent
in the nondurable goods sector. Over the last four quarters,
total manufacturing productivity increased 2.4 percent. Unit
labor costs in manufacturing rose 4.6 percent in the second
quarter of 2011 and 0.4 percent over the last four quarters.  The data sources and methods used in the preparation of
the manufacturing output series differ from those used in
preparing the business and nonfarm business output series,
and these measures are not directly comparable.  See Technical Notes for further information on data
sources.  Preliminary data for the second quarter of 2011 for the
nonfinancial corporate sector also were released today.
Productivity increased 4.4 percent as output and hours rose
7.5 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively.  Revised Measures  The measures released today were based on more recent
source data than were available for the preliminary report.  In the second quarter of 2011, nonfarm business
productivity decreased 0.7 percent, rather than 0.3 percent,
reflecting a downward revision of 0.5 percentage points to
output; hours were not revised. Hourly compensation increased
2.7 percent in the second quarter, a larger gain than
reported August 9. The increase in unit labor costs was
revised up to 3.3 percent. In the manufacturing sector,
productivity showed a smaller decline than previously
reported, 1.5 percent, due to an upward revision to output;
hours were revised up slightly. Unit labor costs increased
4.6 percent rather than 4.4 percent.  In the first quarter of 2011, nonfarm business
productivity growth was not revised. Unit labor costs
increased 6.2 percent, rather than the previous estimate of
4.8 percent, due solely to an upward revision to hourly
compensation. The first-quarter increase in unit labor costs
follows a 2.0 percent decline from 2009 to 2010, the largest
in the annual series.  In manufacturing, productivity growth
was not revised. Unit labor costs fell 0.1 percent, rather
than 1.1 percent, due to an upward revision to hourly
compensation.  Nonfinancial corporate sector productivity growth in the
first quarter of 2011 was revised up to 2.3 percent from the
preliminary estimate of 1.4 percent.  Manufacturing sector productivity, output, and unit
labor costs series were revised back to 1987 to reflect
revised output indexes constructed by BLS using data from the
U.S. Department of Commerce.  Manufacturing productivity was
revised up for the years 2009 and 2010, and the average
annual rate of growth from 2007 to 2010 is now 2.0 percent,
compared to 1.6 percent as of August 9.  Revised annual index
series appear in appendix tables 1-3.  Full historical annual
and quarterly measures can be found on the productivity and
costs home page at www.bls.gov/lpc/#data.  The preliminary Productivity and Costs news release for
third-quarter 2011 is scheduled to be released on Thursday,
November 3, 2011 at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).
