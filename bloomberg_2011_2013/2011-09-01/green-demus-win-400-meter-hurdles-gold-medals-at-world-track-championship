Demus of the U.S. won gold medals in the 400-meter hurdles at
the  world track and field championships  in Daegu,  South Korea .  Greene passed Puerto Rico’s Javier Culson in the final 20
meters to win the men’s final in 48.26 seconds, while Demus took
the women’s title in 52.47 seconds, the leading time in the
world this year.  “I still had not had a gold medal, so this is great,”
Demus told reporters. “It feels so great to bring it home.”  Jesse Williams of the U.S. won the men’s high jump,
Ukraine’s Olha Saladuha took the women’s triple jump,  Kenya ’s
Ezekiel Kemboi won the men’s 3,000-meter steeplechase and
American Jennifer Barringer Simpson captured the women’s 1,500
meters.  Double-amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius helped South Africa
reach the final of tomorrow’s men’s 1,600-meter relay.
Pistorius, who runs with J-shaped carbon-fiber blades, led off
as  South Africa  finished third in its heat behind the U.S. and
Jamaica in a national-record time of 2 minutes, 59.21 seconds.  Pistorius, who finished last in his individual 400-meter
semifinal three days ago, was born without fibulas and had both
legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old.  Defending champion Caster Semenya of South Africa finished
second in her heat to qualify for the semifinals of the women’s
800 meters.  Semenya was banned from competing for 11 months because of
questions about her sex after she took the world title in Berlin
two years ago. She was cleared to compete in July 2010.  In addition to the men’s 1,600 relay, finals will be held
 tomorrow  in the men’s shot put and long jump and the women’s
javelin, 5,000 meters and 200 meters. The heats and semifinals
of the men’s 200, featuring world-record holder Usain Bolt of
 Jamaica , will also be run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
