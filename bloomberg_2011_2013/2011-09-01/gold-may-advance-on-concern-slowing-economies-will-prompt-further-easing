Gold fell for the first time in
three days after a report showing unexpected growth in U.S.
manufacturing bolstered optimism in the economy and eroded
demand for the precious metal as a haven asset.  The  Institute for Supply Management  reported its factory
index was at 50.6 last month, topping analyst estimates’ of
48.5. Prices also fell as the dollar headed for the biggest gain
in two weeks against a six-currency index. Prices touched a
record $1,917.90 an ounce on Aug. 23 amid escalating debt woes
in the U.S. and Europe.  “The manufacturing data is putting some pressure on gold,
and a stronger dollar is not helping matters,” David Meger, the
director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “We will probably see
some consolidation at current levels.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $2.60, or 0.1
percent, to settle at $1,829.10 on the Comex at 2 p.m. in  New
York . Earlier, the price fell as much as 0.9 percent. The metal
climbed 12 percent in August, the biggest monthly gain since
November 2009.  Bullion is in the 11th year of a  bull market , the longest
winning streak since at least 1920 in London, as investors seek
to diversify away from equities and some currencies. The metal
is up 28 percent this year, outperforming global stocks,
commodities and Treasuries.  Fed Action  Minutes of the Aug. 9 Federal Reserve meeting showed some
policy makers favored “more substantial” measures to boost the
 U.S. economy  than the current pledge to hold rates at a record
low for the next two years.  “Everywhere you look in terms of the macro environment,
there are reasons to see why gold should be higher,”  David Wilson , a metals analyst at Societe Generale SA, said today in a
Bloomberg Television interview.  The  U.S. Mint  sold 112,000 ounces of American Eagle gold
coins last month, up 74 percent from July and the most since
January, its website showed. Silver-coin sales advanced 24
percent to 3.68 million ounces.  Silver futures for December delivery slipped 23.6 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $41.532 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery retreated $3.30, or 0.2 percent, to $1,852.90
an ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery declined 5
cents to $790.40 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
