Restaurant Group Plc (RTN) , owner of
Frankie and Benny’s, Chiquito and Garfunkel’s eateries, said
first-half profit fell 34 percent as costs increased.  Net income in the 26 weeks ending July 3 declined to 11.2
million pounds ($18.2 million) from 17 million pounds in the
same period a year earlier, the Glasgow, U.K.-based company said
today in a regulatory statement. Revenue increased 7.5 percent
to 234 million pounds. Sales at outlets open more than a year
rose by 3 percent in the period and by 2.75 percent in the 34
weeks to Aug. 28.  “Against a tough economic backdrop, ongoing cost pressures
and with household incomes being squeezed hard, this performance
demonstrates the resilience of the Restaurant Group’s
business,” Chief Executive Officer Andrew Page said in the
statement. “We’ve made a good start to the second half.”  Britain’s retailers, restaurant and pub chains are
struggling with rising commodity prices, weak  consumer spending 
and an increase in value-added tax. Restaurant Group said its
operating margin declined 20 basis points to 10.8 percent in the
first-half from a year earlier.  Restaurant Group said it opened 11 new sites in the past
eight months and plans to add a further 11 to 16 before the year
end. The company paid an interim dividend of 4 pence per share,
compared with 1.54 pence a year earlier.  Restaurant Group shares rose 1.1 pence, or 0.4 percent, to
287 pence at 9:40 a.m. in  London , giving the company a market
value of 575 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
