Romania may be short of funds to
cover a four-month financing buffer requested by the
 International Monetary Fund  if  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis
pushes up yields, Finance Minister Gheorghe Ialomitianu said.  The Balkan nation will probably have to pay more to finance
its budget deficit “if the markets don’t calm,” Ialomitianu
said at a conference today in Bucharest.  “We have a buffer, I don’t know if it covers financing for
four months, but we can face difficult situations,” Ialomitianu
said. “We are still in a position that allows us to reject the
offers which we consider to be priced too high.”  The  Finance Ministry  sold 2.6 billion lei ($877 million) of
leu-denominated bills and bonds in August, below the 4 billion
lei planned, as investors pushed for higher yields amid concern
over lower-than-expected global economic growth.  Average yields of one-year leu-denominated bills rose to
6.64 percent from 6.18 percent and three-year bond yields to
7.34 percent from 7.09 percent, according to  central bank data .  The government, which seeks to avoid drawing on a
precautionary loan from the IMF and the European Union, has cut
wages and the workforce in the public sector. It aims to bring
the  budget deficit  below 3 percent of gross domestic product
next year, from an estimated 4.4 percent this year.  The plan is to borrow 4.7 billion lei in bills and bonds on
the domestic market this month and international markets may be
tapped for the second time this year as part of a 7 billion-euro
($10 billion) medium-term notes program that runs until 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
