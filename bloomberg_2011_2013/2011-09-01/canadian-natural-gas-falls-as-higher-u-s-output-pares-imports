Canadian natural gas fell amid
speculation higher U.S. production will allow utilities and
other big users to refill storage before the winter heating
season begins. Inventories rose 55 billion cubic feet, or 1.9
percent, to 2.961 trillion in the week ended Aug. 26, the Energy
Department said today. Storage had been expected to rise 60
billion cubic feet, the average of estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. Stockpiles trail the five-year average by 60 billion
cubic feet.  “We’re coming off a high drilling cycle,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics, an energy research
firm in  London ,  Arkansas . Much of the new gas drilling is in
shale formations, where fewer wells are drilled and production
is higher, he said.  Alberta gas for October slipped 2.5 cents to C$3.595 per
gigajoule ($3.57 per million British thermal units) as of 12:55
p.m. New York time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S., and is priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta
system.  Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 7.5 cents to $3.979 per million Btu at 1:13 p.m.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta  system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet, 124 million below target.  Flow Rates  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.41 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.99 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.47 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.28 billion cubic feet today, about 47
percent of its capacity of 2.76 billion.  The volume on Spectra Energy’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.74
billion cubic feet at 10:35 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
