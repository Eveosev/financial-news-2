The chief secretary to the U.K.
Treasury,  Danny Alexander , said Scotland would have suffered a
similar fate to Iceland in the wake of the banking crisis had it
been an independent nation.  Scotland’s 5.2 million people would have been saddled with
about 123 billion pounds ($199 million) of debt in the fiscal
year that ended in March 2010, Alexander said in a speech to
business leaders in Glasgow this evening. More than half of that
would have gone on rescuing Edinburgh-based  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and HBOS Plc, and Scotland would have run a
14 billion-pound  budget deficit , one of the highest per capita
in Europe, he said.  “As the experience of other small countries with large
banking sectors, like Iceland and Ireland, has shown, these
would have been a catastrophic problem for Scotland to deal with
had we decided to go it alone,” Alexander, who represents a
Scottish electoral district in the U.K. Parliament, said,
according to remarks released by his office.  The comments are the latest attempt by the government of
Prime Minister  David Cameron  to counter efforts by Alex Salmond’s Scottish National Party -- which controls the
government in Edinburgh -- to break away from the U.K. The SNP
has promised a referendum on independence by 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
