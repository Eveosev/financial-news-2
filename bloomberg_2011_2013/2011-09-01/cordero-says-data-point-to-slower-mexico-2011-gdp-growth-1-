Mexican Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero  said recent data suggest the economy will grow slower
than anticipated this year.  “We don’t see a scenario of economic contraction, we
simply see growth that is slower than what we saw previously,”
Cordero told a press conference today in Mexico City.  The ministry’s most recent forecast is for gross domestic
product to expand 4.3 percent this year. The economy will grow
3.81 percent this year, according to a survey of economists
published today by the central bank.  It is important for the government to continue to operate
with a budget deficit to stimulate growth and job creation,
Cordero says.  Mexico reported a budget deficit of 164.3 billion pesos
($13.4 billion) in the first seven months of 2011, according to
a Finance Ministry statement on Aug. 30.  The peso gained 0.4 percent to 12.2892 per dollar at 2:58
p.m. New York time from 12.3327 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
