London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  is
bidding for a majority stake in LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd., the
world’s biggest clearinghouse for swaps, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  LSE joins Markit Group Ltd., which provides data on swap
prices, in trying to purchase the London-based company. Interest
in LCH intensified after Deutsche Boerse AG and  NYSE Euronext (NYX) 
agreed to merge in February, creating the world’s largest
exchange operator by market value and winning a dominant share
of futures trading in  Europe . NYSE Euronext Chief Executive
Officer Duncan Niederauer said June 1 that he was working with
Markit on a bid for LCH.Clearnet.  Victoria Brough, a spokeswoman for London-based LSE, and
Andrea Schlaepfer of LCH declined to comment on whether there
was a bid.  LSE’s offer values LCH at 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion),
the Financial Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Clearinghouses such as LCH and  Eurex Clearing  operate as
counterparties for every buy and sell order executed by their
members, who post collateral, reducing the risk from a trader
defaulting on a deal. Exchange operators from  New York  to
Frankfurt and Singapore have sought takeovers to augment equity
businesses after regulation and automated trading eroded profit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
