Nic Brown, London-based head of
commodities research at Natixis Commodity Markets Ltd., said the
easing of monetary policy in emerging economies such as  Brazil 
may be positive for raw material markets. He commented by phone
today.  “The interest cut in Brazil might lead to a new monetary
policy cycle in the developing world in the coming months. This
should result in the emergence of a new dynamic in the commodity
market.”  “Development in these countries has been curbed by high
inflation and tightened monetary policy. With inflation becoming
less threatening, we expect to see more support for economic
growth in the  developing countries . That will offer crucial
support for base metal prices.”  On gold:  “Gold has reached the point where it is a bubble about to
burst. The price is driven by liquidity instead of fundamental
demand. Chinese investors buy gold as a reserve against high
inflation and poor equity market performance. As central bankers
in  China  and  India  ease their monetary policy, local investors
will switch away from gold to equities and other investment
opportunities. ”  To contact the reporters on this story:
