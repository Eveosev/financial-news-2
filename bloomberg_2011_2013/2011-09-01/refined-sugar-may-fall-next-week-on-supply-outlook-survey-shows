Refined sugar may fall next week as
rising Northern Hemisphere production outweighs a possible drop
in output in  Brazil , the world’s top producer and exporter.  Six of 11 traders, analysts and brokers surveyed by
Bloomberg News said refined sugar in  London  would fall. Four
said it would rise, and one was neutral. Before today, futures
for October delivery fell 2.3 percent this week to $762.80 a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Five respondents said raw sugar would gain on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York, four said it would drop, and two expected
little change. Raw-sugar futures for October delivery dropped
2.1 percent to 29.59 cents a pound this week through yesterday.  Nine respondents said refined-sugar’s premium over raw
would narrow, and two were neutral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
