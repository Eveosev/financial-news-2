Oregon ’s board of dentistry said
daily-deal coupons, such as those sold by Groupon Inc., may
violate rules barring the payment of commissions for referrals,
and the state’s board of chiropractors has banned their use.  “The board has preliminarily determined that these may
violate the unprofessional conduct rule,” the Oregon Board of
Dentistry  said on its website . The state’s board of chiropractic
examiners has prohibited the use of “Groupon type fee-splitting
arrangements,” according to a July 25  statement .  Groupon and other companies such as LivingSocial sell
coupons that offer discounts on products and services from local
businesses, making money by taking some of the revenue generated
by the sale. Chiropractors in  California , the most populous U.S.
state, are likely to discuss the matter, said Robert Puleo,
 executive officer  of the California Board of Chiropractic
Examiners.  “That’s not something that my board has discussed -- we
haven’t received any complaints,” Puleo said in an interview.
“But I am sure if it’s happening in Oregon, it’ll be coming to
California, too.”  Julie Mossler, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Groupon,
said the company hasn’t been made aware of the Oregon boards’
concerns.  “We routinely work with regulators to address questions or
concerns and are happy to do so here, too, if they care to reach
out,” Mossler said.  The statements by the Oregon boards were  previously
reported  by the Business Insider blog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
