Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  is
recalling 241,000 3-Series cars in the U.S. because of a rear-
light defect it says may cause crashes.  The recall is for model years 2002-2005 of the 325i, 325xi,
330i and 330xi cars, the Munich-based company said today in a
posting on the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ’s
 website .  Lights including tail, brake and turn signals may only work
intermittently on the cars, BMW told the auto-safety regulator.
This “reduces the ability to warn other motorists of the
driver’s intentions” and “could cause a vehicle to crash
without warning,” the company said.  BMW yesterday recalled 120,000 diesel cars worldwide
because of a defect that could cause filter heaters to keep
running after engines are turned off.  The rear-light problem affects cars only in the U.S., said
Andreas Lampka, a BMW spokesman in Munich. The defect has been
fixed in 20,000 vehicles as part of regular maintenance, he
said.  There have been “no accidents” as a result of the
problem, Lampka said.  The diesel-filter issue risks draining the battery during
winter months, he said, adding that no accidents have been
reported from the problem.  About 2,000 X5 sport-utility vehicles are affected by the
filter-heater issue in the U.S., Lampka said. The SUVs were
built between September 2008 and April 2009. In other markets,
some 1-, 5- and 7-Series cars are affected as well as X3 and X6
SUVs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
