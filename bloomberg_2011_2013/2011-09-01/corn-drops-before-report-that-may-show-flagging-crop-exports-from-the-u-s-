Corn and wheat futures declined in
 Chicago  ahead of a U.S. government report today that may show
exports dropped from a year earlier, after a price jump for the
grains in August reduced their appeal to overseas buyers.  December-delivery corn slipped 1 percent to $7.595 a bushel
on the Chicago Board of Trade at 1:11 p.m. Paris time. The grain
climbed 15 percent last month, the biggest monthly gain this
year and making U.S. supplies less competitive.  Export sales of corn and wheat from the U.S. probably fell
in the week ended Aug. 25 from a year earlier, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  last
month cut its outlook for U.S. corn exports in the year through
September 2012 by 3 million metric tons to 45 million tons.  “USDA has already lowered its export projection,” MF
Global wrote in a report e-mailed today. “In today’s world it
is also easier to substitute Argentine and Brazilian corn
exports for U.S. exports.”  The volume of corn exports is forecast to be held back in
fiscal 2012 because of high prices resulting from tight U.S.
supplies, the USDA said in an  outlook report  yesterday. For
wheat, large exportable quantities of the grain in Russia and
Ukraine limit U.S. competitiveness, the department said.  Investors will be “looking at the latest USDA weekly
export sales this afternoon to see if there’s any sign of demand
slipping with prices where they are,”  Dave Norris , an
independent U.K. grains trader, said on his  website  today.  Paris Wheat  Wheat for December delivery fell 1.2 percent to $7.82 a
bushel in Chicago, after climbing 11 percent last month. Milling
wheat for November delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris
slipped 1.1 percent to 209 euros ($298.39) a ton, following last
month’s 6.8 percent gain.  The USDA is scheduled to release its weekly report on
export shipments at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington  today. Export sales
of corn probably fell to between 200,000 and 700,000 tons, from
1.69 million tons in the year-earlier week, according to a
survey of three analysts by Bloomberg News. Wheat export sales
are forecast to have slipped to between 400,000 and 750,000
tons, from 1.02 million tons.  Investors may also be locking in gains from last month’s
rally ahead of the Labor Day long weekend in the U.S., MF Global
said. Trading will halt on Sept. 5 because of the public
holiday.  Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.9 percent to $14.4475
a bushel, after rising 7.4 percent in August. Rough rice for
November delivery slipped 0.1 percent to $17.925 per 100 pounds
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  The rice export price in  Thailand , the world’s largest
shipper, may climb to more than $700 a ton from $596 on Aug. 31
under a government plan to buy the milled grain from farmers at
above market prices, said Yanyong Phuangrach, secretary for
commerce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
