President  Barack Obama  agreed to a
one-day delay to address a joint session of Congress on his
plans to increase U.S. jobs.  The White House issued a statement that said Obama
“welcomes the opportunity” to deliver the speech on Sept. 8, a
day later than he had planned. House Speaker  John Boehner 
objected to Sept. 7, the same night as a Republican presidential
debate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
