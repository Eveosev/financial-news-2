Mauritius’s rupee is set for its
biggest weekly drop in seven against the dollar as the
manufacturing industry contracted more than estimated in  Europe ,
curbing demand for riskier assets.  The currency declined as much as 0.7 percent to 28.05 per
dollar and traded 0.2 percent down at 27.90 by 2:08 p.m. in the
capital, Port Louis, extending its drop this week to 0.5
percent, the biggest since the five days through July 15,
according data compiled by Bloomberg. Mauritian markets are
closed tomorrow for a public holiday. Against the euro, the
rupee strengthened 0.7 percent to 39.8453.  A manufacturing gauge based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the 17-nation euro region declined to 49 in August
from 50.4 in July, London-based Markit Economics said today.
That’s below an initial estimate of 49.7 published on Aug. 23. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  “It is bad news for us,” Swadicq Nuthay, an economist at
the Port Louis-based  Axys Capital Management , said in a phone
interview. “Our exports of manufactured goods is geared towards
Europe, which is also our main source of tourists.”  Europe buys 65 percent of the Indian Ocean island nation’s
goods and is the largest source of tourism according to the
 Central Statistics Office . Mauritius earns most of its foreign
currency from tourism, and exports of sugar, clothing and
textiles. About two thirds of tourists to the island are from
Europe, the statistics office said on May 19.  Euro-denominated revenue accounts for 41 percent of
foreign-currency receipts according to the Bank of Mauritius.
The rupee closely tracks the euro’s movements against the
dollar, with an average correlation of 0.76 in August. A value
of 1 would mean that they move in lock step.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.151 to 27.3295
rupees, while the selling price was 28.6227 per dollar, compared
with 28.5508 on Aug. 30, according to  indicative exchange rates 
published today on the Bank of Mauritius’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
