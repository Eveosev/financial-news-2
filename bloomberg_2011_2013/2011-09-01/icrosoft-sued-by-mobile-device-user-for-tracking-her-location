Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  was sued by a mobile
phone user claiming the company illegally tracks location
information from mobile devices in violation of state and
federal privacy laws.  The company has designed its mobile operating software
Windows Phone 7 to track users’ location deceptively even after
users choose to disable the feature, according to a complaint
filed in federal court in Seattle today. The software is in
mobile devices made by Samsung Electronics Co.,  HTC Corp. (2498)  and  LG
Electronics Inc. (066570) , and transfers the location data to company
server computers, the complaint shows.  Michigan resident Rebecca Cousineau filed the lawsuit on
behalf of tens of thousands of consumers who use phones with the
Microsoft software and had their location data tracked after
they disabled the feature. The complaint seeks a court order
barring the company from tracking users’ phone locations, $1,000
for each violation, and unspecified punitive damages.  Kevin Kutz , a Microsoft spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment about the lawsuit.  The case is Cousineau v. Microsoft, 11-1438, U.S. District
Court, District of Washington (Seattle).  To contact the reporter on this story:
