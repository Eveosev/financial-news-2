Salamander Energy Plc (SMDR) , a U.K. oil
and gas explorer, fell the most in two weeks in  London  after
plugging and abandoning an exploration well in Vietnam.  Salamander declined 2.6 percent to 224 pence, the biggest
drop since Aug. 18.  The Cat Ba-1X well in Block 101-100/04 off northern Vietnam
discovered “good quality” reservoirs with volumes and pressure
“below levels needed for commercial development,” the London
based company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
