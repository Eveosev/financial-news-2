Spain ’s five-year bonds fell for a
fourth day as demand waned at an auction of the securities,
deepening concern that European Central Bank purchases to stem
the debt crisis won’t be enough to support the market.  German bunds advanced after a report showed European
manufacturing shrank more than initially estimated, adding to
signs the recovery is faltering. Investors bid for 1.76 times
the amount of a new five-year Spanish benchmark on offer, down
from a ratio of 2.85 times at an offering of similar-maturity
debt in July. Spain raised 3.62 billion euros ($5.2 billion)
from the sale, less than the maximum target of 4 billion euros.  “The Spanish auction wasn’t stellar,” said Eric Wand, a
bond strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in  London . “We
would have seen higher yield levels and lower demand without the
safety net of the ECB. Risk seems to be a bit softer today and
so there are still buyers of bunds.”  Five-year Spanish yields climbed three basis points to 4.29
percent as of 4 p.m. in London, after reaching 4.37 percent, the
most since Aug. 8, when the ECB began buying Spanish bonds. The
3.25 percent security maturing in April 2016 fell 0.13, or 1.3
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 95.67. Ten-year yields were
little changed at 5.05 percent, after rising to 5.12 percent,
the highest since Aug. 9.  Bond Purchases  The ECB purchased Italian securities today, according to
four people with knowledge of the transactions who asked not to
be identified because the buying was confidential. A spokesman
for the central bank declined to comment.  The ECB, which is barred legally from buying bonds directly
from governments, has restrained Italian and Spanish borrowing
costs for three weeks through purchases in the secondary market.
Contagion from the debt crisis sent both nations’ 10-year yields
to euro-era records almost a month ago.  Spain’s Treasury said it sold the five-year notes today at
an average yield of 4.489 percent, less than the 4.871 percent
rate in a July 7 auction of bonds maturing in 2016.  The yield difference, or spread, between Spanish 10-year
bonds and similar-maturity German bunds expanded to 295 basis
points, the most since Aug. 8.  “There’s very limited demand for new Spanish or Italian
paper at the moment,” said Norbert Aul, a European interest-
rates strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in London. “Without the
ECB support, any further supply puts pressure on the market.”  Even with the ECB purchases, Italian 10-year yields climbed
two basis points to 5.15 percent. Five-year yields were also two
basis points higher at 4.32 percent.  Weaker Manufacturing  A manufacturing gauge based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the 17-nation euro region fell to 49 in August from
50.4 in July, London-based Markit Economics said today. That’s
below an initial estimate of 49.7 published on Aug. 23. A
reading below 50 indicates contraction.  Economists predict a report this week will show U.S. job
growth slowed. Bunds advanced even as stocks swung between gains
and losses after the U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s
factory index defied economists’ forecasts for the first
contraction in manufacturing in more than two years.  The extra yield investors demand to hold  France ’s 10-year
debt over German securities expanded four basis points to 74
basis points, the widest since Aug. 10, as the nation sold bonds
maturing in 2016, 2021 and 2041.  German 10-year yields fell five basis points to 2.17
percent after earlier climbing to 2.25 percent, the highest
level since Aug. 25. Two-year yields dropped six basis points to
0.66 percent.  Irish Streak  Irish 10-year bonds rose for a 12th day, the longest streak
since August 2005. Ten-year yields fell 10 basis points to 8.53
percent, the lowest since January. They slid 2.23 percentage
points in August amid speculation the nation is better placed
than others to grow its way out of debt.  Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  said today yields are still
a “long way” from allowing Ireland to return to international
markets. Though the yield trend is downward and “lots of real”
money is buying the debt, risks remain, Noonan said in Dublin.  German  government bonds  have returned 5.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries
gained 7.2 percent. Spain’s bonds have returned 5 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
