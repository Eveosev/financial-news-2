Access Bank Plc (ACCESS)  of  Nigeria  will
complete its acquisition of  Intercontinental Bank Plc (INTERCON) , a bailed-
out lender, in October 2012, said Chief Executive Officer
Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede.  The banks will become a “single entity” then, he said today
on a conference call from Lagos, the commercial capital.
Intercontinental shareholders can currently sell their stock to
Access Bank at 2.75 naira ($0.02) each, he said.  Intercontinental was among the eight lenders whose chief
executives were fired by the  Central Bank  of Nigeria in 2009
after a lending crisis threatened to collapse some of the West
African nation’s banks. The central bank bailed out the lenders
with 620 billion naira and this year gave them a Sept. 30
deadline to recapitalize, or face liquidation or
nationalization.  Access Bank’s shares rose 1.1 percent to 5.63 naira by the
2:30 p.m. close in Lagos. The stock has lost 41 percent this
year, outpacing a 14 percent decrease in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index. Shares of Intercontinental Bank have
been placed on technical suspension by the bourse, which means
that they can trade but the price cannot change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
