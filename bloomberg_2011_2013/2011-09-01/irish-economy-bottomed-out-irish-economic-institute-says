Ireland’s economy, which has shrunk
about 12 percent since 2007, has “bottomed out,” the  Economic
& Social Research Institute  said.  While the economy won’t “feel better” until 2015 when the
government finishes raising taxes and cutting spending, it
probably won’t “feel much worse” in the meantime, said Joe
Durkan, an economist at the government-funded institute, known
as the ESRI.  Gross domestic product  will expand 1.8 percent this year,
the ESRI forecast said in a report published in Dublin today,
trimming a May prediction of 2 percent. Growth will accelerate
to 2.3 percent in 2012, the organization said, cutting a 3
percent estimate.  Ireland’s economy is struggling to grow again, as debt
laden consumers and the government cut spending. After seeking
an international rescue last year, the government is pledging to
cut the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2015 from a
forecast 10 percent this year.  “The public finances are likely to remain within the
targets set for the  budget deficit ,” the ESRI said. “The
overall targets for 2012 are more or less predetermined but we
think that it might be prudent to overachieve slightly as a
precautionary measure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
