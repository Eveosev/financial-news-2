     Sept. 1 (Bloomberg) --  Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s biggest
exporter of  iron ore , said it has been in talks to engage
Chinese shipping companies to haul the steelmaking material to
 China  on its very large ore carriers under long-term contracts.  The Brazilian company has held discussions with many
Chinese shipowners and expects to sign some deals, Vale’s China
President Luiz Meriz, said in an interview in Jinan, Shandong
province, today, without giving a timeline.   China’s largest shipping companies are lobbying the
government to foil Vale’s plan to build a $2.3 billion fleet of
the world’s biggest iron ore carriers that will transport the
raw material to the nation, Zhang Shouguo, executive vice
chairman of the China Shipowners Association, said in a July
interview. The association is seeking cooperative shipping
contracts with Vale, Zhang said, without elaborating.   Vale Brasil, the first in the fleet, was diverted to  Italy 
on its maiden voyage, rather than unloading at Dalian in China
as scheduled, because of draft restrictions at the port and a
request from a European customer, Vale Chief Executive Officer
Murilo Ferreira said on July 19.  Chinese regulators haven’t approved any of its ports to
increase accommodation capability to more than 300,000 dead-
weight tons for dry bulk carriers because of safety and
environmental concerns, Zhang said in July.  The vessel wasn’t diverted because of political reasons,
Meriz said.   Vale’s iron ore exports to China will remain near last
year’s levels at about 130 million metric tons, according to
Meriz.   To contact the reporter on this story:
