Argentine Economy Minister  Amado Boudou  said the government won’t accept an audit of its economic
data by the  International Monetary Fund , Ambito Financiero
reported.  The system has worked well and doesn’t need changing,
Boudou told reporters at the Council of the Americas yesterday,
according to Ambito.  Argentina and the IMF have been discussing the terms of a
so-called Article IV consultation, a review of the country’s
economic policies and data that every member of the organization
submits on an annual basis. A review by the IMF, which Argentina
has blocked since 2006, may help the country win support from
creditors to restructure defaulted debt.  Boudou also said the government is making progress with
negotiations with the Paris Club group of creditor nations,
according to Ambito.  To contact the reporter on this story:
