Hungarian central bank President
Andras Simor told an audience at a conference in Alpbach,
 Austria , that avoiding euro adoption is “not an option” for
the seven former communist European Union members that have yet
to join the euro region.  “For eastern  Europe  outside the euro zone, the lesson we
have learned is financial integration without monetary
integration is a perfect recipe for external vulnerability.  “In countries like Hungary, where half the debt is in
foreign currency, not joining the euro is not an option. The
question is what is the best time and when are we really
prepared to effectively compete within the euro zone.”  Editors: James M. Gomez, Douglas Lytle  To contact the reporter on this story:
