U.S. stocks rose, erasing an early
slump, after a report showing unexpected growth in manufacturing
industries bolstered optimism in the economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.7 percent to
1,227.11 at 10:01 a.m. in  New York  after slumping 0.5 percent.
The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 72.35 points, or 0.6
percent, to 11,685.88.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to
50.6 in August from 50.9 the prior month, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said today. A reading of 50 is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction in manufacturing.  Economists projected the gauge would drop to 48.5,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
Estimates of the 80 economists ranged from 44 to 52. A reading
above 42.5 generally indicates an expansion in the overall
economy.  U.S. stocks climbed yesterday, capping the S&P 500’s
biggest eight-day gain since 2009, after reports showed that
U.S. business activity and factory orders expanded at a faster
pace than economists had forecast. The gains helped the  S&P 500 
pare its August decline to 5.7 percent, still the biggest
monthly selloff since May 2010.  The S&P 500 plunged 18 percent from an almost three-year
high on April 29 through Aug. 8 as concern grew that the world’s
largest economy may relapse into a recession and  Europe  will
fail to contain its debt crisis. The retreat was led by
companies whose earnings are most-sensitive to the economy,
including financial firms, industrial manufacturers and energy
and raw-materials producers.  The index rebounded 8.9 percent from Aug. 8 through
yesterday after the plunge dragged its valuation to 12.2 times
the reported earnings of its companies, the cheapest level since
the  bull market  began in 2009. Gauges of S&P 500 utilities,
commodity producers, health-care companies and financials firms
rallied more than 10 percent to lead the recovery, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
