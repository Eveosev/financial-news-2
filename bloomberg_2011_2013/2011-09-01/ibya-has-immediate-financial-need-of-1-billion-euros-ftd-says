Libya has immediate financial needs
of at least 1 billion euros ($1.44 billion) after rebel forces
pushed out  Muammar Qaddafi , the Financial Times Deutschland
 said , citing Libyaâ€™s newly appointed ambassador to  Germany .  The money would help cover imports of food and medicine for
about two weeks, Ambassador Ali Massidna al-Kuthani was quoted
as saying in the German newspaper today. He said he expects
countries taking part in a conference on Libya in Paris today to
free most blocked Libyan assets, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
