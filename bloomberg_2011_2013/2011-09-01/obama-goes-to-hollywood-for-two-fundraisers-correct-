(Corrects attribution in third paragraph in story that
moved yesterday.)  President  Barack Obama  will hold two
fundraisers in Hollywood in September, tapping the film stars
and media executives who have been among his staunchest
supporters.  The president will hold a small-donor event, with tickets
going for $250, at the House of Blues on Sunset Boulevard on the
afternoon of Sept. 26. Later that evening, he will head to the
Fig & Olive restaurant for a major donor event, where attendance
goes for $35,800 a couple. The events were reported by the
 Hollywood Reporter . Details were confirmed for Bloomberg by a
Democratic official who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.  Obama, who Democratic activists say could need $1 billion
for his re-election campaign, has been targeting big money
donors from Hollywood and  Wall Street  and asking them to make
the maximum donations allowed to a joint fund with the
 Democratic National Committee .  The president raised more than  $9 million  from people
working in movies, TV and music for his 2008 campaign, according
to the Center for Responsive Politics.  Direct campaign contributions aren’t the only way Obama is
benefiting from his support in the  movie industry .  Jeffrey Katzenberg, the chief executive of Dreamworks
Animation SKG, is a major donor to Priorities USA, an
independent committee founded by former White House staffers who
will help the president’s re-election. Katzenberg is also
helping to generate donations to the group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
