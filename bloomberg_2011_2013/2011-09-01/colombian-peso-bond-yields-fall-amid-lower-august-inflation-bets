Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to fall the most in more than a week, on speculation
declining food prices caused inflation to slow in August.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent bonds due in July
2024 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.35
percent at 1:58 p.m. New York time. That’s its biggest decline
since Aug. 22. The price rose 0.494 centavo to 121.603 centavos
per peso.  Inflation is likely to continue slowing from its current
3.42 percent annual rate, Colombia’s Central Bank chief Jose
Dario Uribe said yesterday. Banco de la Republica targets 2011
inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent.  “People have been cutting their inflation expectations
based on wholesale prices that show food prices fell in
August,” said Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Correval SA. “Uribe’s comments also helped ease
concern some have had over future inflation readings.”  Correval now expects consumer prices to increase 0.09
percent this month, compared to a previous forecast of 0.15
percent, and annual inflation to end this year at 3.4 percent.
The median forecast of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg is
for consumer prices to rise 0.13 percent in August from the
previous month, after rising 0.14 percent in July. The national
statistics agency is slated to publish its monthly inflation
report Sept. 5.  Colombia’s peso weakened 0.1 percent to 1,779.20 per
dollar, from 1,778.02 yesterday. The peso is up 7.7 percent in
the past six months, the best performance among 25 emerging-
market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
