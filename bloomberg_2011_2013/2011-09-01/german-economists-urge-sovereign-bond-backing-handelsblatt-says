A group of German economists called
for banks to back their sovereign-bond holdings with equity
capital,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing Bonn University economist
Manfred Neumann.  The academic group, known as the Kronberg Circle, suggested
making the European Union-wide change as part of the revised
capital rules known as Basel III, the Dusseldorf, Germany-based
newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
