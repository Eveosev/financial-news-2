Hog prices may rebound from the
biggest monthly loss since October as consumers switch from beef
to cheaper pork, according to Karl Skold, an economist and the
former head of commodity procurement for ConAgra Foods Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that cattle futures are trading
near the highest level relative to hogs in nine months. Hog
futures on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange, which touched a
seven-month low of 82.45 cents a pound yesterday, may rally to
87 cents by the end of the year as demand climbs, Skold said.  “Into the fall, we’ll have good demand for pork
products,” Skold said in a telephone interview from Omaha,
 Nebraska . “They’re going to be favorably priced to beef.”  Demand for pork will also rise through the end of the year
as consumers favor the meat over beef for both the Thanksgiving
and Christmas holidays, and hams will be a “good value,” Skold
said. Retail prices for boneless ham have dropped 0.6 percent in
the past year, while boneless-sirloin steak is up 6.7 percent
from a year earlier, government data show  Last month, hog futures traded in Chicago tumbled 10
percent. On Aug. 11, cattle futures were 31.425 cents more
expensive than hogs, the widest spread since Dec. 1. Yesterday,
the difference was 31.125 cents.  “I really expect hogs to begin to grab hold,”  Dennis Smith , a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Prices have
cheapened up a bit for the pork, and it’s starting to attract
some better demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
