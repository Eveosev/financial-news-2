Coffee exports from  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of the robusta variety used in instant
coffee, may have fallen 23 percent last month from the year
earlier period, according to Marex Spectron Group.  Bean shipments were estimated at 65,000 metric tons in
August, down from 84,000 tons in the same period last year, the
London-based brokerage said in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Exports for the 2010-11 crop year through to July were
985,000 tons compared with 906,000 tons for the same period last
season, data from the brokerage showed.  “There is simply too much coffee,” according to the
market report.  Vietnam had about 1.235 million tons of coffee available
for sale in the 2010-11 crop year ending Sept. 30, Marex said.
It estimated production for this season at 1.115 million tons.  “Vietnam had probably a greater carry-in than we thought
and a higher crop than we thought,” it said in the report.  Ending stocks in  Ho Chi Minh City  were estimated at 55,000
tons, while farmers will end the season with 70,000 tons of
beans, Marex data showed.  Vietnamese coffee exporters accelerated shipments earlier
this year after the May robusta contract on the NYSE Liffe
exchange switched to being more costly than the July contract,
almost doubling certified stocks in  Europe .  Robusta Inventories  Robusta coffee inventories with a valid grading certificate
in warehouses monitored by the NYSE Liffe exchange climbed to
417,420 tons as of July 11, up from 217,670 on Dec. 27, Liffe
data showed. Stockpiles stood at 398,090 tons as of Aug. 22,
according to data published on the exchange’s website.  Liffe certified stocks will fall to between 260,000 tons
and 290,000 tons by the end of the year, Marex said in the
report.  “This will be a meaningful draw but with both the producer
and the consumer priced on November, we do not believe that this
draw will translate into excitement in the futures, either on
the flat price or the structure,” it said.  Robusta coffee for November delivery slid $38, or 1.6
percent, to $2,295 a ton by 11:04 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London .
The price climbed 9.1 percent over the past month.  Vietnam’s production will increase 5 percent to 10 percent
in the season starting in October to 21 million to 22 million
bags of 60-kilograms, Marex estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
