Chilean President Sebastian Pinera
said he plans to retain a mix of state- and privately-owned
educational institutions, arguing it gives students and their
families more schooling options.  Responding to three months of student protests, Pinera said
he wants to guarantee scholarships for poorer students and
doesn’t believe in state-funded free education for all.  “We don’t believe in nationalizing or a state monopoly in
education,” the Harvard University-trained economist and
billionaire investor said in a speech in Santiago last night.  Student leaders have been pushing for tuition-free
schooling and banning profits in the industry. Pinera will meet
with them on Sept. 3 for the first time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
