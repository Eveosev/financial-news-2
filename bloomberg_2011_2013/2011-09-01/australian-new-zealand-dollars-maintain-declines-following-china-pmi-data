The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars maintained earlier declines after a gauge of Chinese
manufacturing activity was weaker than economists had estimated.  The so-called Aussie fell to $1.0675 as of 11:03 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0707 yesterday in  New York . New Zealandâ€™s
currency declined to 85.05 U.S. cents from 85.41 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
