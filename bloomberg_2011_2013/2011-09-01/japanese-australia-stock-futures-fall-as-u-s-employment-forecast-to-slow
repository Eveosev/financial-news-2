Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  fell ahead of a report forecast to show the U.S. added
fewer jobs in August, adding to signs the world’s largest
economy is still struggling.  American depositary receipts of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest lender, dropped 1.6 percent
from the closing share price in Tokyo after banks fell in the
U.S. Those of  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s largest trading company,
slid 1 percent after commodity prices dropped. ADRs of  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company, retreated 1.3
percent after metal prices slipped.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 8,995 in Chicago yesterday, down from 9,060
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 8,990 in
 Osaka  at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index fell 1.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
declined 0.4 percent in Wellington.  “As people cut their forecasts for the jobs data, it’s
difficult for investors to take a position one way or the
other,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based
Nomura Holdings Inc.  Japan’s incoming Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  will name
his cabinet today. Noda, 54, takes the reins of a country beset
by economic contraction, burdened by the world’s largest debt
and reeling from the March earthquake and nuclear disaster.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. In New York, the index dropped 1.2 percent
yesterday, snapping a four-day advance, before a Labor
Department report today that may show non-farm payrolls climbed
by 68,000 in August after a 117,000 increase in July, according
to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Factory Output  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Jan Hatzius cut his forecast for
the employment gain to 25,000 from 50,000.  Brian Jones , an
economist at  Societe Generale , lowered his prediction to an
increase of 9,000 from 67,000.  U.S. stocks rose earlier yesterday after a report showed
manufacturing unexpectedly expanded. The Institute for Supply
Management’s factory index fell to 50.6 last month from 50.9 in
July, beating the median economist projection of 48.5. A reading
above 50 shows manufacturing is growing.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 8.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 4.2 percent drop by the  S&P
500  and a 13 percent loss by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks
in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.1 times for the S&P 500
and 9.9 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
fell 0.6 percent yesterday. The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six industrial metals including copper and aluminum
dropped 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
