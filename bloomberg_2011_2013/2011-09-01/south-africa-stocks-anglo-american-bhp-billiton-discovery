by 5 p.m. in Johannesburg, its highest close in a month.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA)  ,  South Africa ’s largest retail
bank, ended at its strongest in more than seven months, gaining
2.01 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 141.50 rand. The bank has no
“mass” job-cut program in place, Deputy Chief Executive

after labor union Solidarity said it is applying to the
country’s Labor Court for an interdict to stop planned job
reductions at Absa.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s largest mining
group, fell the most in two weeks, easing 2.39 rand, or 1
percent, to 237.83 rand. Commodities slumped, led by copper, oil
and wheat, on speculation slowing manufacturing will curb demand
for raw materials.  Coal of Africa Ltd. (CZA)  , a producer of coal, rose to
its highest in a month, surging 38 cents, or 4.9 percent, to
8.18 rand. The company said it expects its Vele colliery water
license in South Africa will be resolved within the “next
couple of weeks.”  Discovery Holdings Ltd. (DSY)  , South Africa’s largest
medical insurance administrator, gained for a fifth day, rising
1 rand, or 2.6 percent, to 39.25 rand. Net income for the 12
months to June 30 climbed 50 percent to 2.58 billion rand ($368
million).  Group Five Ltd. (GRF SJ), a South African construction
company, sank for the first time in four days, dropping 53
cents, or 2 percent, to 26 rand. The group was downgraded to
“underperform” from “neutral” at  Macquarie Research  by
equity analyst Peter Steyn, with a 12-month price estimate of
22.50 rand.  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  , an iron ore-producing unit of
Anglo American, rose to its highest in more than four weeks,
gaining 15.51 rand, or 3.2 percent, to 500 rand. The company was
raised to “hold” from “sell” at Deutsche Bank AG by equity
analyst  Tim Clark , with a 12-month target estimate of 445 rand.  Optimum Coal Holdings (OPT)  Ltd, a coal producer,
closed at its highest in almost five months, climbing 45 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to 33.55 rand. Glencore International Plc, the
largest publicly traded commodities supplier, proposed a cash
takeover of Optimum that values the South African target at $1.2
billion, or 34 rand a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
