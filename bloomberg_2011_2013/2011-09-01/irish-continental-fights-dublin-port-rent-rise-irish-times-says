Irish Continental Group is in a
fight with its landlord, Dublin Port, about a proposed 60

from ICG.  “To be confronted with a 60 per cent rent increase in the
current economic environment is totally unacceptable,” the
newspaper reported, citing ICG’s press release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
