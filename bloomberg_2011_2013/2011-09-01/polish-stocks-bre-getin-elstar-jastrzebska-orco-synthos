Poland ’s WIG20 Index fell for the
first time this week, losing 36.31, or 1.5 percent, to close at
2,414.64.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Bank Millennium SA (MIL)  , a unit of Banco Comercial
Portugues SA, sank 0.21 zloty, or 4.2 percent, to 4.79 zloty.
 Getin Holding SA (GTN)  , the financial-services group
controlled by billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, slid 0.65 zloty, or
6.6 percent, to 9.14 zloty.  BRE Bank SA (BRE)  , majority-owned
by Commerzbank AG, fell 13 zloty, or 4.7 percent, to 262 zloty.  The zloty lost as much as 2.9 percent against the Swiss
franc today, fueling speculation lenders will face defaults on
foreign-currency mortgages. Franc-denominated mortgages totaled
151.8 billion zloty ($52.1 billion) in June, accounting for
almost 53 percent of all home loans in Poland, according to the
country’s financial regulator.  Cersanit SA (CST)   dropped 0.19 zloty, or 2.8 percent, to
6.68 zloty, falling for a second day. Poland’s biggest tile
producer posted first-net income of 6.5 million zloty, missing
the 17.4 million-zloty mean estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
analysts.  Elstar Oils SA (ELS)   soared 1.18 zloty, or 22 percent,
to 6.57 zloty, the highest close in more than a year, after
Bunge Ltd. announced a bid to buy the producer of edible oils
and biofuels at 6.75 zloty a share, according to a statement to
the exchange by the broker managing the bid.  Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW PW) fell for a second
day, sinking 4.3 zloty, or 4 percent, to 103.7 zloty. The coal
producer that sold shares in an initial public offering in June
was cut to “hold” from “buy” at Societe Generale SA.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, slid 6.3 zloty, or 3.6 percent, to
168.5 zloty, snapping a five-day advance. Copper fell as export
orders slid for the first time in two years in  China , the
world’s biggest consumer of the metal.  Orco Property Group (ORC)  SA slumped the most in three
weeks in Warsaw trading, losing 3.15 zloty, or 11 percent, to
25.1 zloty after the developer posted a first-half loss and said
late yesterday it’s facing a “very challenging situation” in
refinancing.  Synthos SA (SNS)   tumbled 0.39 zloty, or 7.5 percent, to
4.8 zloty, its first drop in five days. The chemical producer
controlled by Polish billionaire Michal Solowow reported first-
half net income of 403 million zloty, below the mean estimate of
426.7 million zloty in a Bloomberg survey of three analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
