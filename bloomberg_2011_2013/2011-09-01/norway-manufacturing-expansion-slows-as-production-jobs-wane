Norway ’s manufacturing growth slowed
in August as production eased and new hiring almost stalled,
signaling weaker economic expansion in Europe is hurting
industrial exports.  A seasonally-adjusted index based on responses from
purchasing managers fell to 55.5 from a revised 56.8 in July,
Oslo-based Fokus Bank said today in a statement. It was forecast
to be 54.3, according to a Bloomberg survey of 10 economists. A
reading above 50 signals growth.  Growth in the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter faces
headwinds as exports, which make up about half the economy,
struggle to find buyers amid a European debt crisis and
weakening U.S. recovery. Norway’s central bank on Aug. 10
scrapped a planned rate increase, leaving its benchmark
rate unchanged at 2.25 percent. The bank cited the “recent 
flare-up” in financial markets and a risk of “weaker growth
internationally.”  Stalling growth in  Europe , Norway’s biggest export market,
represents “an extra challenge” for exporters, Finance
Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen said last month.  The sub-index measuring production eased to 56 from 57.8
while orders rose to 59.8 from a revised 54.6 in July. The
employment index dropped to 51 from 61.4 and the index for the
inventory of purchased goods rose to 54.2 from 53.8 in July.  Norway’s PMI Index was started by Fokus Bank in 2004 in
cooperation with the Association for Purchasing and Logistics.
Fokus is owned by Danske Bank A/S, Denmark’s biggest lender.  Norges Bank policy makers will meet again on Sept. 21 to
decide on  interest rates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
