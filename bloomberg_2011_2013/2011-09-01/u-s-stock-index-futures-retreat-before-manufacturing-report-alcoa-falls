U.S. stocks retreated, snapping a
four-day advance for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, as banks
fell and investors speculated that tomorrow’s jobs report will
show the world’s largest economy continues to struggle.  Financial stocks dropped the most within 10 groups in the
S&P 500, sliding 2.4 percent.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  slumped
3.5 percent after agreeing to pay future Federal Reserve
penalties and write down $53 million of  mortgage loans  in New
York to gain approval for its sale of Litton Loan Servicing LP.
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  fell at least 2.4 percent,
pacing losses among companies most-tied to economic growth.  The S&P 500 declined 1.2 percent to 1,204.42 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The benchmark gauge rallied 5.1 percent during a four-
day streak through yesterday. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
lost 119.96 points, or 1 percent, to 11,493.57.  “There is some reserve and perhaps some hesitance going
into tomorrow’s jobs report,” Robert Pavlik, chief market
strategist at Banyan Partners LLC in  New York , said in a
telephone interview. The firm manages over $1 billion. “The
administration has a huge task in front of it. Business leaders
are hesitant to hire and spend money. That’s why the stock
market generally hasn’t done anything.”  Stocks fell before a Labor Department report tomorrow that
may show non-farm payrolls climbed by 68,000 after a 117,000
increase in July, according to the median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Jan Hatzius cut his forecast for the gain to 25,000 from 50,000.
 Brian Jones , an economist at  Societe Generale , lowered his
prediction to an increase of 9,000 from 67,000.  Manufacturing Data  Shares rose earlier after the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s factory index fell to 50.6, beating the median
economist projection of 48.5. The data helped ease concern
spurred by Federal Reserve data in August showing manufacturing
slowed in the New York, Philadelphia and Richmond, Virginia,
regions. The  S&P 500  climbed yesterday, paring its August
decline to 5.7 percent, the biggest monthly drop since May 2010.  Stocks trimmed losses at the end of last month after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said during an Aug. 26
speech in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , that the central bank still has
tools to stimulate the economy without signaling he will use
them. Last year, he foreshadowed a $600 billion bond-purchase
program at the same event, helping to stoke a 30 percent surge
in the S&P 500 through April 29. Since then, the index has
fallen as much as 18 percent amid economic concern.  ‘May Not Like It’  “Every time you get some positive data for the economy,
people think the Fed will take the possibility of a QE3 off of
the table,” Thomas Nyheim, a Greenville, Delaware-based money
manager for Christiana Trust, which oversees $7.5 billion, said
in a telephone interview about a third round of so-called
quantitative easing from the central bank. “We may not like it,
but we’ll probably need to get used to slower growth.”  Stock futures swung between gains and losses before the
open of regular trading as a report showed that applications for
U.S. unemployment benefits fell last week as the influence of
the strike at Verizon Communications Inc. waned, showing the job
market is making little headway more than two years after the
recession ended.  All 10 groups in the S&P 500 fell today, with losses being
led by financial, industrial and raw-material companies. The  KBW
Bank Index (BKX)  slid 3 percent as all of its 24 stocks retreated.  Goldman Falls  Goldman Sachs slumped 3.5 percent to $112.16. The Fed
ordered Goldman Sachs to conduct an independent review of
Litton’s foreclosures in 2009 and 2010 to address a “pattern of
misconduct and negligence,” the regulator said today in a
statement. Litton’s sale to  Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN)  was completed
today after reaching accords with the Fed and New York state
regulators, according to a Goldman Sachs statement.  The shares also fell after the bank was downgraded to
“hold” from “buy” at ISI Group. The 12-month share-price
estimate is $135.  Gap Inc. (GPS)  lost 3 percent to $16.03. The largest U.S. apparel
chain reported sales at its stores open more than one year fell
6 percent, more than the 3.9 percent drop estimated by analysts.  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-
sensitive to economic activity dropped 2 percent. Caterpillar
decreased 2.7 percent to $88.55, while Alcoa slid 2.4 percent to
$12.49.  Concerns that the S&P 500 will plunge amid slowing earnings
growth are overblown, according to Liz Ann Sonders of  Charles
Schwab  Corp.  More Than Double  The benchmark measure of U.S. equities surged as much as
102 percent from a 12-year low in March 2009 through the end of
April this year as earnings beat analysts’ estimates. Profits at
S&P 500 companies are forecast to grow to $124.11 a share in
2013, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s more than double the annual increase during the 2008-2009
financial crisis.  “There is this misperception that the minute the peak of
earnings happens, the market is going to fall out of bed,”
Sonders, New York-based chief investment strategist at Charles
Schwab, said in a radio interview today on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. “The market
tends to continue to fare pretty well unless you get some sort
of massive collapse in earnings, which I don’t think is in the
cards this time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
