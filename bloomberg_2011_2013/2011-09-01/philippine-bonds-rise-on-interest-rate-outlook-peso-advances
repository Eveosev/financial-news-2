Philippine bonds rose, pushing 10-
year yields to a five-month low, on speculation policy makers
won’t need to raise borrowing costs as the economy slows. The
peso advanced to the strongest level in almost a month.  Gross domestic product rose 3.4 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier after having increased 4.6 percent
in the three months ended March, government data showed
yesterday. Slowing growth will “moderate” inflation, which the
central bank will take into account when it meets next week,
Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said yesterday.  “Poor growth data and scope for a softer inflation print
validate the central bank’s cautious stance,” said Radhika Rao,
an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore . “They are in no
hurry to tighten policy levers further at this stage.”  The yield on the 7.375 percent bonds due March 2021 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.69 percent as
of 4:10 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tradition Financial
Services. The rate was the lowest since the securities were
first issued in March.  The peso closed 0.1 percent higher at 42.237 per dollar,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached 42.18
earlier, the strongest level since Aug. 4.  Consumer prices rose 5.1 percent in July from a year
earlier after having climbed 5.2 percent the previous month,
official data showed last month. The  National Statistics Office 
will unveil the inflation data for August on Sept. 6, two days
before the monetary policy meeting.  To contact the reporter for this story:
