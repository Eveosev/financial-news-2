Lan Airlines SA (LAN) ,  Latin America ’s
largest carrier by market value, rose to a six-week high after
Chile’s Constitutional Court rejected a request by Pal Airlines
to review Lan’s planned takeover of  Brazil ’s  Tam SA. (TAMM4)   Lan climbed 2.1 percent to 13,240 pesos at the close of
trading in Santiago, the highest level since July 21. Tam jumped
4.6 percent to 34.53 reais at 3:22 p.m. New York time in Sao
Paulo trading.  The Constitutional Court dismissed by four votes to one the
request to block the transaction presented by Chilean carrier
Pal Airlines, according to documents posted on the court’s
website. Chile’s antitrust tribunal, known as TDLC, is also
reviewing the proposed acquisition.  Lan agreed to buy Tam in an all-stock transaction in August
2010. The combination follows similar tie-ups among U.S. and
European carriers trying to reduce operating costs and increase
revenue by offering a broader global market to passengers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
