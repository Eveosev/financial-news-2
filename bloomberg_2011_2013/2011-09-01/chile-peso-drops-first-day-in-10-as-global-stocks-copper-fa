Chile ’s peso rose for a fifth day,
erasing an earlier decline, as a report showed U.S.
manufacturing unexpectedly expanded in August.  The peso gained 0.3 percent to 459.52 per dollar at 12:01
p.m. New York time, from 460.85 yesterday. It earlier fell as
much as 0.4 percent.  “Jobless claims and manufacturing data came in better than
expected and that allowed the peso to strengthen,” Francisca Roa, an analyst at Santiago-based foreign exchange consultancy
firm Netgociando SA, said today in a phone interview.  Jobless claims in the U.S. fell by 12,000 to 409,000 in the
week ended Aug. 27, while the  Institute for Supply Management ’s
factory index fell to 50.6 in August. Economists projected the
gauge would drop to 48.5, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  Chile’s central bank paid an average 461.18 pesos per
dollar for $50 million today as part of a $12 billion program to
stem the peso’s appreciation, according to data posted on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
