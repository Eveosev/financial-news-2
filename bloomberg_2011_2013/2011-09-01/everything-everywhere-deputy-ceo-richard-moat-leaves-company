Everything Everywhere, the U.K.
joint venture of  France Telecom SA (FTE)  and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , said
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Richard Moat decided to leave the
company as new CEO Olaf Swantee reshapes management.  Moat will step down alongside five other executives after
Swantee more than halved the number of directors to 10 from 25.
The CEO will also review the existing structure of the unit,
which operates the T-Mobile and Orange brands in the U.K.  Everything Everywhere has moved from a broader leadership
team following the 2009 merger to a more “simple team,”
Swantee said today on a conference call.  London-based Everything Everywhere became the largest
mobile-phone operator in the U.K. after the merger, overtaking
Telefonica SA’s O2 unit. The company had 27.5 million customers
at the end of June, after losing 188,000 users in the second
quarter as it shifted customers to long-term contracts.  Swantee, who replaced Tom Alexander and was formerly
responsible for  France Telecom ’s European operations, will
decide whether to retain Everything Everywhere’s two brands by
the end of October, he said. “The U.K market is really
polarized between value and premium customers,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
