  Russia ’s manufacturing growth in
August was “sluggish”  and remained below 50 on the HSBC
Purchasing Managers’ Index, indicating a contraction.  The index rose last month to a seasonally adjusted 49.9
from 49.8 in July,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  said in a report today,
citing data compiled by London-based Markit Economics.  “Though marginal, the latest contraction was the third in
the past four months”, HSBC said. The bank added that the data
“signalled a further moderation in input price inflation.”  The rate of inflation has weakened continuously since
February, reaching a 25-month low in the latest period and the
findings suggest a further drop in new business, the bank said.  “Overall, the Russian manufacturing sector appears to be
aligned with a global trend of weak manufacturing and industrial
growth in recent months,”  Alexander Morozov , HSBC’s chief
economist for Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
