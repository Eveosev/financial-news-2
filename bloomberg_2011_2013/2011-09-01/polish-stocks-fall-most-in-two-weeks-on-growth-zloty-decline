Polish stocks fell the most in two
weeks, snapping a three-day advance, as manufacturing slowed,
commodities declined and the zloty slipped to a one-week low
against the Swiss franc.  The WIG20 Index tumbled 2.6 percent to 2,387.49 at 11:40
a.m. in Warsaw, the most on a closing basis since Aug. 18.  Bank
Pekao SA (PEO) , the country’s second-largest lender, and  Getin Holding
SA (GTN) , a financial-services group, slumped the most in two weeks.
The zloty depreciated 1.8 percent to 3.6270 per franc.  The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of the country’s
manufacturing, fell to 51.8 in August from 52.9 the previous
month, while data showed economic growth in  Germany , Poland’s
biggest trading partner, slowed in the second quarter. The zloty
weakened against the franc for a third day, fueling speculation
lenders will face defaults on foreign-currency mortgages.  “There are concerns about the economic slowdown in  Europe 
in general and also a stronger franc doesn’t help banks,” said
Lukasz Bugaj, a Warsaw-based analyst at Bank Millennium SA.  Pekao, majority-owned by UniCredit SpA of Italy, sank 3.5
percent to 142.7 zloty. Getin, controlled by Polish billionaire
Leszek Czarnecki, declined 4.4 percent to 9.36 zloty. PKO Bank
Polski SA slid 3.3 percent to 35.05 zloty, snapping a two-day
advance.  The zloty lost as much as 2.3 percent to 3.6432 against the
Swiss franc today. Franc-denominated mortgages totaled 151.8
billion zloty ($52 billion) in June, accounting for almost 53
percent of all home loans in Poland, according to the country’s
financial regulator.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) , the copper producer with the biggest
European mine output, slid 3.1 percent to 169.4 zloty, snapping
a five-day advance. Copper declined on concerns that  China ’
efforts to tame inflation even as the economy slows may reduce
demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
