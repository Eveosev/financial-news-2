Hays Plc (HAS) , the U.K.’s biggest
recruitment firm, will open offices in emerging markets
including Malaysia and Chile in coming months as international
fees surge, Chief Executive Officer Alistair Cox said.  Hays posted a 21 percent increase in sales in the year
ended June 30 to 3.26 billion pounds ($5.29 billion), driven by
growth in Asia. Net income grew eight-fold to 80.1 million
pounds, or 5.59 pence per share, from 9.3 million pounds, or
0.48 pence per share, reflecting previous charges for back-
office job cuts and a reduced price-fixing fine, the London-
based company said today in a statement.  “Over two thirds of our net fees are now generated outside
the U.K., and that’s a real milestone,” Cox told reporters on a
conference call. “It gives us a very, very good position to
take advantage of the many long-term structural growth
opportunities.”  Hays increased consultant hiring overseas by 27 percent,
opening 12 new offices, including new operations in the U.S.,
 Mexico  and Colombia. Net fee growth rose more than 60 percent in
 Hong Kong ,  China  and Singapore as demand for skilled workers in
the manufacturing and engineering industries surged, Cox said.  Net fees in the U.K. and Ireland fell 1 percent to 241
million pounds with growth in the private sector slowing as
banks and financial institutions cut staff, Cox said. Net fees
in the U.K. public sector decreased 35 percent.  Hays rose 2.7 pence, or 3.6 percent, to 78.2 pence at 9:30
a.m. in London, giving the company a market value of 1.08
billion pounds. The stock has tumbled 39 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
