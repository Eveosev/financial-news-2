Orange output in  Brazil ’s  Sao Paulo 
state, the world’s biggest producing region, will rise more than
previously forecast this year as dry weather favored fruit
maturation, the country’s  Agriculture Ministry  said.  Sao Paulo state will produce 377.1 million boxes, up from a
May forecast of 355 million boxes, the ministry’s Conab crop-
forecasting agency said today in an e-mailed statement. Last
year, Sao Paulo produced 322.2 million boxes. A box of orange
weighs 40.8 kilos (90 pounds).  Orange trees in the state, which accounts for about 80
percent of the South American country’s output, will cover an
area of 580,574 hectares (1.4 million acres), lower than the
610,600 hectares previously estimated. The planting area
decreased after growers cut down unproductive trees and small
farms switched to sugar cane.  About 324.3 million boxes will be processed into orange
juice and the rest will be consumed as fruit, Conab said.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 2.2 cents,
or 1.4 percent, to $1.61 a pound at 10:19 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
