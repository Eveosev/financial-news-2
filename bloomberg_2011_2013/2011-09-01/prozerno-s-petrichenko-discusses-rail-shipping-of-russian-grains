Vladimir Petrichenko, general
director of Moscow-based grain-market researcher and consultancy
OOO ProZerno, comments on Russian Railways’ temporary ban on
shipments of grain to the port of Novorossiysk because of a
backlog.  “There is nothing extraordinary in this. Such situations
are standard for us. The ban for transportation to Novorossiysk
is a usual happening in the whole history of  Russia ’s grain
exports.  “Taking into account the port and two grain terminals have
been modernized and are able now to unlock logistics of railway
cars and automobiles this year better than in past years, they
have made a step forward toward solution of transportation
problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
