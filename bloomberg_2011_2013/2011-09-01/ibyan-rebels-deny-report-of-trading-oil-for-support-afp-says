Libya ’s National Transitional
Council denied a report that it’s offering to give French
companies control of a third of the country’s oil production in
exchange for political backing,  Agence France-Presse  said.  The Paris-based  Liberation newspaper  reported today that
the council, the rebels’ leadership body, had sent a letter
dated April 3 to Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani
in which it promised 35 percent of Libya’s oil production to
French companies for “full and permanent support” from France.  Mansour Sayf al-Nasr, the Paris envoy of the council, the
rebels’ leadership body, denied that such a letter had been sent
or that any such pledge had been given, AFP reported today.  Libyan rebel leaders are in Paris to discuss support for
the country’s reconstruction and transition to democracy with
leaders including French President  Nicolas Sarkozy , U.K. Prime
Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel .  Liberation said it had obtained a copy of the letter, which
stated that the rebels’ spokesman, Mahmoud Shammam, would
negotiate the deal with France.  French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe  said he’s unaware of
any such letter.  “The council said very officially that, in the
reconstruction process of Libya, it would first call on those
who supported it,” Juppe  said on RTL radio . “That seems
logical and rather fair to me. There is this declaration from
the council, but I’m not aware of any formal agreement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
