Canadian stocks fell, paring a
weekly gain for the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index, after
the U.S. said employment was unchanged in August.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) ,  Canada ’s second-largest
energy company by market value, dropped 3.7 percent as crude oil
plunged 2.8 percent.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , the country’s largest

12,602.41, trimming its weekly advance to 2.2 percent.  “The payroll data clearly was below the consensus and even
some of the whisper numbers that were coming out from some of
the larger U.S. brokers,” Timothy Lazaris, chief executive
officer of Red Sky Capital Management Ltd. in Toronto, said in a
telephone interview. The firm oversees about C$54 million ($55
million). “It’s difficult to put risk on with declining U.S.
data and with problems continuing to persist in  Europe .”  The S&P/TSX has decreased as much as 18 percent from its
2011 high on April 5 amid concern the global economic recovery
is faltering. The jobless rate in the U.S. was unchanged at 9.1
