Steel containers of nuclear waste
shifted at a Dominion Resources Inc. power plant during the 5.8-
magnitude earthquake in  Virginia  on Aug. 23, the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said.  The 25 dry casks, and the spent fuel inside, moved from one
inch to four-and-a-half inches in their storage area at the
North Anna reactor complex, NRC spokesman Scott Burnell said
today in an e-mail.  “We would expect a cask to survive a quake without leaks”
of radiation, Burnell said.  The casks, which weigh about 115 tons when full, are spaced
apart to minimize  radiation exposure  for workers, company
spokesman Richard Zuercher said in an e-mail. “We are
evaluating whether there would be any benefit” to moving them
back to their original positions “or whether they are fine
where they are,” he said.  Dominion, based in Richmond, Virginia, informed local media
about the cask movement late yesterday, Zuercher said. “We did
not make a formal report to the NRC about this,” he said.  The plant’s storage pools that keep spent fuel cool
continue to operate, Zuercher said.  Reactors at the plant, about 40 miles (64 kilometers)
northwest of the state capital, have been been closed since the
temblor. The earthquake, the biggest in Virginia in more than
100 years, should lead the NRC to impose tougher reactor-safety
standards, Representative  Edward Markey , a Massachusetts
Democrat, has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
