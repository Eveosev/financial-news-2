Merck KGaA (MRK) ’s Millipore unit sees
 China  as the biggest growth market as demand in the U.S. wavers
amid budget pressures, said Bernd Reckmann, the Merck board
member responsible for the Millipore unit.  Merck Millipore opened an office in Shanghai in May that
the company hopes will help to expand its drug-development
technology and services business in the region, Reckmann said at
a press conference yesterday. Merck Millipore has seen a
slowdown in sales of its lab equipment among academic and
government customers in the U.S. due to the economic downturn
there and it’s uncertain when it will recover.  “Certainly  Asia , and especially China, will be one of the
strongest growth markets in the future,” Reckmann told
reporters at the company’s Millipore plant in Molsheim,  France .
The company will open a new building today at the site, which
manufactures Millipore’s water-purification systems for
customers worldwide.  Merck, which bought Billerica, Massachusetts-based
Millipore Corp. for $6 billion in cash last year, is looking for
smaller technology acquisitions to expand the business, Reckmann
said. He also said he expects biosimilars to drive volume growth
in the future.  The company’s liquid-crystals division is experiencing a
weak third quarter but could see growth during the fourth
quarter, Reckmann said. The world’s largest maker of liquid
crystals for flat-panel televisions said its largest customers
are trying to sell inventory before placing new orders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
