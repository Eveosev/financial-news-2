The European Union will ask  Serbia 
and  Kosovo  tomorrow to agree on status-neutral documents for
products in mutual trade as a solution to their trade dispute,
 Novosti  newspaper reported, citing a diplomat in Brussels it did
not name.  The dispute stemming from Serbia’s refusal to recognize
Kosovo and a reciprocal ban on Serbian products may be resolved
with rubber stamps that say “Kosovo Customs” without state
insignia, instead of “Republic of Kosovo” with the Kosovar
flag and coat-of-arms, the report said. Negotiations under the
EU auspices are to resume tomorrow after two months and
following border incidents in the meantime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
