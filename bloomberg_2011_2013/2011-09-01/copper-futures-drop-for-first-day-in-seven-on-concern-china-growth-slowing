Copper declined for the first time
in seven days as industrial metals fell on concerns that  China ’s
efforts to tame inflation even as the economy slows may reduce
demand.  Three-month delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
retreated as much as 1.1 percent to $9,171 a metric ton and
traded at $9,172 by 3:06 p.m. Shanghai time. The contract lost
5.7 percent in August, the first drop in three months. Zinc fell
1.7 percent today to $2,252.25 a ton.  A manufacturing index in China, the biggest copper
consumer, stayed near the borderline between expansion and
contraction in August. The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to
50.9 from a 29-month low of 50.7 in July, with new export orders
falling to 48.3 from 50.4 of the previous month, the China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in a statement
today. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion.  “Data showed there is no hard-landing risk,” Zhang Yu, an
analyst at Yong’an Futures Co., said by phone from Hangzhou.
Still, the expectation is that monetary tightening measures will
remain in place as inflation is unlikely to ease soon, she said.  Five interest rate increases since October, limits on home
purchases and lending curbs that included raising banks’ reserve
requirements to a record are slowing domestic demand in the
world’s second-largest economy. Inflation reached a three-year
high of 6.5 percent in July.  Inflation Focus  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said that a faltering global recovery
and turbulence in financial markets have yet to convince his
government to switch from a focus on taming inflation. The
slowdown in the economy is “reasonable” and within government
expectations, Wen wrote in an article in the ruling Communist
Party’s Qiushi magazine  published  today. An abstract was posted
on the government’s website yesterday.  Copper for November delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 0.3 percent to 68,190 yuan ($10,689) a ton.  Wen’s comments have “smashed” speculation that the
government may loosen its tightening grip and made investors
realize that inflation is still at the top of its agenda, said
Ye Yanwu, head of research at Everbright Futures Co.  “Fundamentally, upside for metals remains capped,” Walter de Wet, an analyst at Standard Bank Plc., said in a research
report yesterday. “As a result, a rally in base metals is more
likely to be on an increase in speculative activity rather than
more sustainable real demand.” Copper is facing technical
resistance between $9,220 and $9,300, he said.  Aluminum in  London  lost as much as 0.3 percent to $2,461 a
ton. Buyers in  Japan ,  Asia ’s largest importer, agreed to pay a
premium of $118 a ton for the fourth quarter this year over the
cash contract on the LME, 2 percent lower from $120 for the
third quarter. This was the first drop in three quarters amid
abundant supplies as smelters in the  Middle East  boosted
shipments to Asian buyers.  Lead dropped 1.2 percent to $2,548 a ton, and tin declined
1 percent to $24,150 a ton. Nickel fell 0.7 percent to $22,043 a
ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
