Pan African Resources Plc (PAF) , a
Southern African gold producer, hopes to list its Manica gold
project in Mozambique on the Australian Stock Exchange in early
November, said a person familiar with the matter.  Pan African has yet to make a formal application to the
exchange, the person said, asking not to be named because the
information isn’t public. Macquarie Group Ltd. is advising the
Johannesburg-based company on the transaction, said the person.  Pan African Resources and Sean Chilvers, a Johannesburg-
based director at Macquarie’s local unit, declined to comment.  The company said Aug. 19 it will separately list shares in
Manica to “unlock optimal  shareholder value .” Pan African
plans to remain an “anchor shareholder” after a listing, which
will provide capital needed to build an operation producing
20,000 tons a month of gold-bearing rock by the third quarter of
next year, according to its website.  The timing is favorable for the transaction “considering
the growing interest in  Mozambique  and global sentiment towards
gold,” the company said earlier this month. Gold had its
biggest gain in 21 months in August, rising 12 percent to
$1,825.72 an ounce as investors bought the metal as a haven.  Pan African fell 3 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 1.55 rand by
the 5 p.m. close of trading in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
