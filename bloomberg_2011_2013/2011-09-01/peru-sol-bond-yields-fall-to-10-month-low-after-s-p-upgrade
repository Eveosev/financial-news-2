Peru’s sol bonds rose, pushing
yields to a 10-month low, amid boosted appetite for the nation’s
financial assets after  Standard & Poor’s  raised the country’s
foreign debt rating.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 5.55 percent at 12:09 p.m. New York time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s its lowest
level since Nov. 8. The bond’s price rose 0.06 centimo to 115.92
centimos per sol.  S&P on Aug. 30 raised Peru to BBB, the second-lowest
investment grade, from BBB- and gave the rating a stable
outlook, pointing to signs President Ollanta Humala will
continue policies that made the country the region’s fastest-
growing economy.  “The timing of the upgrade was a complete surprise,” said
 Roberto Flores , an economist at Inteligo SAB, a Lima-based
brokerage. “People were expecting it more towards the end of
the year. We should see the market continue to react positively
to the news in coming days.”  The sol was little changed at 2.7275 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7265 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
