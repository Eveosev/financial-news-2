Croatian Finance Minister Martina Dalic said labor costs are “within a norm for the region” and
don’t present a significant obstacle to foreign investment,
 Banka Magazine  reported.  In an  interview  published today in the Zagreb-based
magazine, Dalic said contributions from monthly wages in
 Croatia , at 37.2 percent, are comparable to those in Slovakia,
Germany and Slovenia.  Should the ruling  Croatian Democratic Union  win general
elections in December, Dalic said in the next four years she
would lower the budget deficit, stabilize the public debt,
create conditions for lowering  interest rates  and champion taxes
that boost consumption, according to the report. She also said
she probably wouldn’t introduce a property tax.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
