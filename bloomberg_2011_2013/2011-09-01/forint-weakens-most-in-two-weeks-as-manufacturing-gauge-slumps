The forint weakened the most in two
weeks against the euro and Hungarian shares fell as reports on
manufacturing across  Europe  added to concern the global economic
recovery is slowing.  The Hungarian currency slid as much as 1.3 percent, the
most since Aug. 18, and traded 0.7 percent weaker at 273.12 by
5:44 p.m. in Budapest. The BUX equity index dropped 1.1 percent,
led by declines at OTP Bank Nyrt. and Mol Nyrt.  The euro area’s index of purchasing managers in
manufacturing fell to 49 in August from 50.4 a month earlier,
while Hungary’s PMI slid to 50.1 from a revised 52.1, according
to separate reports released today. European stocks erased
declines and American shares swung between gains and losses
after a report showed manufacturing in the world’s largest
economy unexpectedly expanded.  Hungary  sold a planned 50 billion forint ($261 million) of
12-month Treasury bills today, according to data published by
the state debt management agency on Bloomberg. The average yield
rose to 5.71 percent from 5.69 percent at the previous sale of
bills with similar maturity on Aug. 18, while investor demand
fell to 105 billion forint from 187.88 billion forint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
