Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , which
completed the sale of its Litton Loan Servicing subsidiary
today, agreed to pay future penalties and review foreclosures so
that victims of wrongful seizures can be compensated.  The firm signed a consent order to “address a pattern of
misconduct and negligence relating to deficient practices in
residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing”
involving Litton, the Federal Reserve Board said in a statement
today.  “The review is intended to provide remediation to
borrowers who suffered financial injury as a result of wrongful
foreclosures or other deficiencies identified in a review of the
foreclosure process,” according to the statement.  Goldman Sachs agreed to retain an independent consultant to
review foreclosures initiated by Litton that were pending in
2009 or 2010. The New York-based firm will also be responsible
for paying any related penalties imposed on Litton by the Fed,
which said in April sanctions are appropriate and may be levied.  Goldman Sachs agreed in June to sell Litton to Ocwen
Financial Corp. for about $264 million in a deal that was
completed today. The announcement came two months after Goldman
Sachs wrote down the value of the mortgage-servicing business by
about $200 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
