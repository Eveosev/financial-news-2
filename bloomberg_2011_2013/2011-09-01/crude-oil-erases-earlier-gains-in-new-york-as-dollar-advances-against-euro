Crude declined for the first time in
eight days in  London  before reports that may show the U.S.
economic recovering is losing strength, damping demand for fuel.  Futures reversed earlier gains, falling as much as 1.1
percent, as  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis caused the dollar to
strengthen, undermining the appeal of dollar-priced assets such
as crude. U.S. reports may say manufacturing shrank in August
for the first time in two years while employment growth slowed.
China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index rose in August from a 29-
month low, according to data published today.  “The economic soft patch looks as if it will last longer
than we had thought, but I am not convinced it will end in
recession,” said Thorbjoern Bak Jensen, an analyst at Global
Risk Management in Middelfart,  Denmark , who predicts Brent will
average $107 in the fourth quarter.  Brent crude  for October settlement fell as much as $1.24 a
barrel and was at $114.15 at 1:36 p.m. on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London, snapping its longest winning streak since
April. It was earlier surged to $115.27, the highest since Aug.
3. The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $25.71 to
U.S. futures, compared with a record close of $26.21 on Aug. 19.  Oil for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was down 37 cents at $88.44 a barrel after falling as
much as 60 cents to $88.21 a barrel. Futures fell 7.2 percent in
August, their biggest monthly loss since May, and are down 3.2
percent this year.  U.S. Manufacturing Slows  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing
index fell to 48.5 last month from 50.9 in July, according to
the median estimate of 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
before today’s data. The dividing line between expansion and
contraction is 50, a level that the gauge last fell below in
July 2009.  Tomorrow’s Labor Department report may show growth in
nonfarm payrolls slowed to 70,000 from 117,000. ADP Employer
Services said yesterday that U.S. companies added 91,000 workers
to payrolls in August, the fewest in three months, according to
data from ADP Employer Services.  China ’s PMI rose to 50.9 last month from a 29-month low of
50.7 in July, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
said today. A separate index by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics was 49.9, compared with 49.3 the prior month. A
reading of 50 is the borderline between expansion and
contraction.  Gulf Storm System  A system of clouds and thunderstorms over the southeastern
 Gulf of Mexico  has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical
cyclone in the next two days, the National Hurricane Center said
in an  outlook  last night.  “Interests along the entire northern Gulf of Mexico coast
should monitor the progress of this disturbance,” the NHC said.  BP Plc began yesterday removing more than 500 non-essential
workers from some platforms in the Southern Green Canyon area,
according to a message on the company’s hurricane hot line. The
London-based company said it is preparing for a potential shut-
in and full evacuation if necessary.  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. evacuated non-essential workers
from its Gunnison, Nansen and Boomvang platforms in the western
Gulf, according to a notice on the Woodlands, Texas-based
company’s website.  Katia, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season, may
grow into a major storm this weekend north and east of  Puerto
Rico , the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The storm was
about 1,000 miles (1,620 kilometers) east of  St. Lucia  in the
Caribbean with maximum winds near 75 miles per hour, the NHC
said in an advisory at 5 a.m. New York time. Katia was moving
west at 20 mph, the Miami-based center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
