Oil advanced from a two-day low in
 New York  as investors speculated that signs of manufacturing
growth in China and the U.S. indicate fuel demand will increase
in the world’s two biggest crude consumers.  Futures gained as much as 0.5 percent after China’s
Purchasing Managers’ Index and U.S. factory orders climbed.
Crude supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for West
Texas Intermediate oil, dropped a fifth week, according to the
Energy Department. A report today may show U.S. jobless claims
fell last week. Brent futures rose for an eighth day.  “We’ve got a reassuring PMI number from China, and if the
U.S. turns out to have more jobs than expected, I think we’re
off and running for Brent,” said  Gordon Kwan , head of regional
energy research at Mirae Asset Securities Ltd. in  Hong Kong  and
the most accurate forecaster for New York oil among analysts
ranked by Bloomberg in the eight quarters ended June 30.  Oil for October delivery gained as much as 44 cents to
$89.25 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $89.01 at 2:27 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday fell 9 cents to $88.81. Prices dropped 7.2
percent last month and are down 2.6 percent this year.  Brent oil for October settlement climbed 14 cents to
$114.99 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The European benchmark contract was at a premium of
$25.94 to U.S. futures, compared with a record close of $26.21
on Aug. 19. The front-month contract’s 8-day winning streak is
the longest since October 2009.  China  Manufacturing  China’s PMI rose to 50.9 last month from a 29-month low of
50.7 in July, according to the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing. A separate index by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics was 49.9, compared with 49.3 the prior month. A
reading of 50 is the borderline between expansion and
contraction.  Cushing stockpiles fell 577,000 barrels to 33.1 million,
according to the Energy Department report yesterday. Total U.S.
inventories increased 5.28 million barrels as Hurricane Irene
approached.  Refinery utilization slid 1.1 percentage points to 89.2
percent, the report showed. That’s above the five-year average
of 87.7 percent. Total products supplied, a measure of fuel
demand, rose 1.7 percent to 19.6 million barrels a day, the
first gain in three weeks.  “Large draws at Cushing and firm refinery utilization
leave us bullish in our daily biases,”  Stephen Schork ,
president of the Schork Group Inc., an energy advisory company
in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , said in a note.  U.S. Orders  Oil capped its biggest monthly loss since May last month
amid signs of slowing economic growth in the U.S. Prices
rebounded today before a report that may show claims for U.S.
unemployment benefits fell to 410,000 last week from 417,000 in
the prior week, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.
Data yesterday showed orders placed with U.S. factories rose 2.4
percent in July, the most in four months.  Katia became the second Atlantic hurricane this year,
according to an advisory by the National Hurricane Center at 11
p.m. New York time yesterday. Katia, rated category one, was
about 1,165 miles (1,875 kilometers) east of the Leeward Islands
with 75 mph winds and moving west-northwest at 20 mph, the
advisory said. The storm may reach waters north of  Puerto Rico 
by Sept. 4, the Miami-based center said.  While the storm is forecast to turn out to sea eventually,
a shift westward could bring it to land in eastern  Canada ,
according to private forecaster AccuWeather. Canada’s Atlantic
region, a major gasoline supplier for the Northeast, exported
469,704 cubic meters (2.96 million barrels) of the fuel in May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
