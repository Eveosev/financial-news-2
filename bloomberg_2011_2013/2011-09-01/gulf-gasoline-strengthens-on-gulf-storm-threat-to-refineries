Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened as
a low-pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico may grow into a
storm, threatening fuel production.  "Interests along the entire northern Gulf of Mexico coast
should monitor the progress of this disturbance,’’ the National
Hurricane Center said in  an advisory  at 2 p.m. Eastern time. The
Gulf system has an 80 percent chance of becoming a tropical
cyclone in the next 48 hours as it moves slowly northwestward,
the center said.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast rose 1.05 cents to 6 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:48 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
4.79 cents to $2.9645 a gallon.  Nearly half  of U.S. refining distillation capacity is
located in the Gulf Coast region, according to the Energy
Department.  Meteorologists led by  Matt Rogers  at Commodity Weather
Group in Bethesda, Maryland, said in a note to clients today
that the Gulf system has a 30 percent chance of becoming a
Category 3 major hurricane that would disrupt oil and gas
output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
