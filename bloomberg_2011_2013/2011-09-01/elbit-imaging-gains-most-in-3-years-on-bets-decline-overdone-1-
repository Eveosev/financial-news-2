Elbit Imaging Ltd. (EMIT) , an investor in
real estate and medical technology, surged the most in almost
three years on speculation a drop to a record low was overdone
after quarterly results beat some investors’ expectations.  The shares soared as much as 22 percent, the most since
November 2008. They were 9 percent higher at 10.67 shekels as of
12:26 p.m. in Tel Aviv, giving the company a market value of 272
million shekels ($76 million). The stock, which has tumbled 77
percent this year, closed at a record low on Aug. 28.  “Sentiment toward the stock changed as investors saw the
results weren’t as bad as they might have been,” Adar Etzioni,
an analyst at Migdal Capital Markets Ltd. in  Tel Aviv , said by
telephone. “There’s still high risk because it’s a real-estate
company in emerging markets but investors are realizing the risk
is outweighed by the share price and business potential.”  Elbit yesterday reported a second-quarter loss of 30.2
million shekels, less than the 63.3 million-shekel loss posted
for the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
