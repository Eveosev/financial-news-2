Western Europe’s slowing economy
will hurt  Hungary ’s growth prospects for “the next couple of
years,” central bank President Andras Simor said.  “Most recently, as we see that the European economies are
not going to grow as strongly as what was hoped for a few months
ago, unfortunately it has an immediate impact on Hungary’s
growth prospects for the next couple of years,” Simor said in
an interview in Alpbach, Austria today.  Hungary’s economy stalled in the second quarter as
industrial output petered out amid concern the debt crises in
Europe and the U.S. and slowing growth in  China  will derail the
global recovery. Hungary has relied on  Germany , its biggest
export market, to speed its recovery from a recession.  The government now expects growth to be close to 2 percent
this year, compared with a previous estimate of 3.1 percent. The
central bank, which in June forecast growth 2.6 percent growth
for this year and 2.7 percent for 2012, will also have to adjust
its estimates, Simor said.  “The next forecast, which will come out in September, will
probably show poorer results for 2011, and probably also for
2012, as a direct consequence, among other things, of what is
happening in  Europe  and particularly in the euro zone,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
