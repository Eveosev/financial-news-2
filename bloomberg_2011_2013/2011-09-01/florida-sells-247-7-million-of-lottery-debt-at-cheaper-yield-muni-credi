Florida sold $247.7 million of bonds
backed by the state lottery at yields cheaper than comparable
revenue debt as it works to stem a decline in sales.  Pricing of the deal’s largest portion, $30.7 million
maturing in 2022, produced a 3.15 percent yield, or 41 basis
points below a 10-year index of A rated general-purpose revenue
bonds, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The longest
maturity, $14.2 million due in 2023, yielded 3.4 percent, 60
basis points below a 12-year index of A rated revenue bonds.  The debt carries  Standard & Poor’s  top AAA rating and
Moody’s Investors Service’s fifth-highest of A1. The disparity,
which sometimes makes Florida lottery bonds difficult to price,
didn’t deter investors in yesterday’s sale, said Justin Land,
who manages $3 billion of municipal assets, including Florida
lottery bonds, at Naples-based Wasmer Schroeder & Co.  “ The deal  did pretty well,” Land said in a telephone
interview. “Not only have  interest rates  dropped, but the
spreads have tightened as well, so they seem to be getting a
pretty good rate.”  Florida’s Board of Education, which finances school
construction, sold the lottery bonds and will use the proceeds
to refund existing issues. The deal produced $24.5 million of
net present-value savings over the life of the bonds, said  Ben Watkins , director of the state’s Bond Finance Division.  Hurt by Recession  The recession has hurt revenue at the Florida lottery, the
third-largest in the U.S. by sales. The lottery’s contribution
to the state education trust fund after payments to winners and
operating costs will decrease by 5 percent in fiscal 2011, which
ends June 30, according to a Moody’s report. It will drop again
the following year by 0.8 percent before rising 1.7 percent in
fiscal 2013, Moody’s said.  The state is looking to enhance instant lottery games and
scratch-off tickets to help boost sales, said Watkins.  “They’re constantly keeping those fresh and introducing
new games in order to keep people interested in playing,”
Watkins said in a telephone interview from Tallahassee.  Ron Schwartz, who manages the $880 million RidgeWorth
Investment Grade Tax-Exempt Bond Fund in  Orlando , also cited the
narrower spread for Florida lottery bonds at the sale.  Wells
Fargo & Co. (WFC)  was the winning bidder on the competitive deal.  “They usually, in the past, have traded at a larger spread
off the triple-A,” Schwartz said in a telephone interview.  A Florida lottery revenue bond rated A1 that sold in 2008
and matures in July 2023 traded Aug. 24, the most recent
transaction, with an average yield of 3.35 percent, or 59 basis
points below a 12-year index of A rated general-purpose revenue
debt at the time.  Highest Yield  The trade that produced the highest yield so far this year
occurred on Jan. 19, with an average yield of 5.36 percent, or
57 basis points above that day’s index.  Yields on top-rated 10-year tax-exempt debt rose to 2.23
percent yesterday, following a 2.17 percent 2011 low on Aug. 23.
The year-to-date average is 2.88 percent. Yields on top-rated
30-year tax-exempt bonds hovered at 3.86 percent yesterday,
after a year-low of 3.82 percent on Aug. 23. The 2011 average is
4.53 percent.  Following is a description of a pending sale of municipal
debt:  NEW YORK STATE THRUWAY AUTHORITY, which oversees a 570-mile
toll road system, will sell as soon as next week $350 million of
personal-income tax revenue bonds to finance highway and bridge
projects. The bonds are rated AAA, Standard & Poor’s highest
grade. Siebert Brandford Shank & Co. LLC will lead banks on the
deal. (Added Sept. 1)  To contact the reporters on this story:
