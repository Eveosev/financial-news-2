Singapore’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , rose to the highest since May, data from the
Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
increased 6.7 percent to 21.5 million barrels in the week ended
Aug. 31,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Supplies were at the highest since the week
ended May 25.  Stockpiles of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, rose 2 percent to 13.3 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline dropped 11
percent to 8.8 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
