Double amputee sprinter Oscar Pistoriushelped  South Africa  reach the final of the men’s
1,600-meter relay at the track and field world championships.  Pistorius, who runs with J-shaped carbon fiber blades, led
off as South Africa finished third in its heat behind the U.S.
and Jamaica in a national-record time of 2 minutes, 59.21
seconds in Daegu,  South Korea . The final is tomorrow.  Pistorius, 24, is competing at his first elite event since
the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 2008 overturned a ban on
him by track and field’s ruling body. The IAAF had ruled the
blades give him an advantage.  Pistorius, who finished last in his individual 400-meter
semifinal three days ago, was born without fibulas and had both
legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
