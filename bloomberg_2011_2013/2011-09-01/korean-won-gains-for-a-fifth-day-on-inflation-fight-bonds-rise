South Korea ’s won strengthened for a
fifth day, the longest run of gains in almost two months, on
speculation policy makers will favor currency gains to tame the
fastest inflation in three years.  Government bonds  gained.  Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent from a year earlier in
August after increasing 4.7 percent the previous month,
Statistics Korea said today. That exceeded all 11 forecasts in a
Bloomberg survey of economists, whose median estimate was 4.8
percent. Inflation is expected to ease in September as improved
weather helps increase vegetable production, Yang Dong Hee, an
official at Statistics Korea, said today.  “Players are speculating that the authorities will allow
currency appreciation for some time to curb increases in
imported goods prices,” said Roh Sang Chil, chief currency
dealer with Kookmin Bank in  Seoul . “Exporters selling dollars
before the Chusok holiday also supported the currency.”  The won rose 0.5 percent to 1,061.30 per dollar at the 3
p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
earlier touched a four-week high of 1,061.01. The currency
depreciated 1.2 percent last month, the most since November.  South Korea’s trade surplus shrank to $821 million in
August from $6.3 billion the previous month, official data
released today showed. Export growth was little changed at 27
percent.  The government’s three-year bonds rose for a third day,
pushing yields to the lowest level in a week.  The yield on the 3.5 percent bonds due June 2014 fell four
basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.46 percent,
according to prices from Korea Exchange Inc. The rate dropped 34
basis points in August, the biggest decline for a benchmark
three-year note since November 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
