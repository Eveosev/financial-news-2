Health insurers will have to justify
publicly annual premium increases of 10 percent or more under a
U.S. regulation that takes effect today, the  Department of
Health  and Human Services said.  The rationales will be posted on company websites and on
the agency’s site, www.healthcare.gov. HHS made the announcement
on its site today.  Regulations stemming from the 2010 health-care law,
published in May, require insurers to explain proposed rate
increases to state and federal officials, the department said in
an  announcement .  U.S. regulators can’t compel insurers to halt or reduce
premium increases under the regulation. The oversight will
“shine a light on proposed double-digit increases” and tamp
down coverage costs because health plans won’t want to be seen
raising prices more than 10 percent, said Steve Larsen, director
of the U.S. Center for Consumer Information and Insurance
Oversight.  Premiums are rising because of escalating health-care
costs, and forcing companies to submit to the new requirements
won’t bring them down, according to  America’s Health Insurance
Plans , the  Washington  lobby for health insurers.  “Highly publicized provisions such as premium rate review
may make for good sound bites, but literally do nothing to
address the soaring cost of medical care,” the trade group said
in a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
