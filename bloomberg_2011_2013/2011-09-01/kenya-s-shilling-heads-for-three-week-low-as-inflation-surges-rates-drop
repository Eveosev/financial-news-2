Kenya ’s shilling headed for a three-
week low against the dollar after a report showed inflation
quickened to more than triple the target and borrowing costs
fell, eroding returns on assets.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
0.4 percent to 94.05 per dollar by 12:21 p.m. in the capital,
Nairobi, heading for the weakest close since Aug. 9.  Surging food and fuel prices raised inflation to 16.7
percent in August, a 10th month of advances, the  Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics  said on Aug. 29. The shilling, which
weakened to a 17-year low on Aug. 9, has added to price
pressures by increasing the cost of imports. The overnight
discount rate is now at 17.87 percent, according to the Nairobi-
based central bank’s website. That compares with 31.4 percent on
Aug. 26, Reuters reported on Aug. 30.  “Overnight rates are easing and there is more liquidity
between the banks,” Duncan Kinuthia, a currency trader with
Commercial Bank of  Africa , said by phone from Nairobi today.
“Inflation has been priced in as well; we’re seeing persistent
inflation.”  Financial markets in Kenya were closed yesterday to mark
Eid al-Fitr, the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.  The average interbank lending rate in Kenya declined to
19.25 percent on Aug. 30, compared with 27.7299 a day earlier,
after the central bank changed the way it calculates charges for
loans from its discount window.  To contact the reporter on this story:
