MTN Uganda Ltd., the East African
nationâ€™s biggest phone company, will double call tariffs
tomorrow because of rising operating expenses, the Daily Monitor
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Themba Khumalo.  Charges will increase to 240 Ugandan shillings (9 cents)
per minute, the Kampala-based newspaper said. Operating costs
increased after the shilling weakened by more than 20 percent
against the dollar in recent months, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
