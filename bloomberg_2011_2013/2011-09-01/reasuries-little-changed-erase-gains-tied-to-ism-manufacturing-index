Treasuries advanced before a
government report tomorrow forecast to show the pace of growth
in nonfarm payrolls is slowing, adding to the trend of weakening
economic data.  U.S. debt yields fluctuated between gains and losses
earlier after the  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
index fell less than forecast in August, U.S. initial jobless
claims were almost as projected last week and European
manufacturing shrank in August more than initially estimated.
Minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s Aug. 9 meeting released this
week showed some policy makers urged action to stimulate a
sluggish economy, leading to speculation the central bank may
consider additional measures.  “Even though Treasury yields are historically low, we have
room to go lower if we get any kind of indication the economy is
falling out of bed,” said  David Coard , head of fixed-income
trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a brokerage for
institutional investors. There aren’t many investors willing to
be short “going into a big number like this. Many of them”
were covering short positions. A short position is a bet an
asset will declined in value.  Yields on 10-year notes fell nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 2.13 percent at 5:01 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the
2.125 percent security maturing in August 2021 rose 26/32, or
$8.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 30/32. The yield rose
earlier as much as five basis points.  Thirty-year bond yields fell 11 basis points to 3.50
percent and two-year note yields dropped two basis points to
0.18 percent, the lowest since Aug. 18  August Performance  Ten-year yields declined 57 basis points last month, the
most since a 71 basis point drop in December 2008. The yield
slid to a record low of 1.97 percent on Aug. 18.  “There’s a lot of pessimism at these levels,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at Societe Generale SA in New York. “It’s all
about data dependency, whether you’ll see quicker action out of
the Fed come September.”  Treasuries returned 2.8 percent in August as the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index lost 5.7 percent and high-yield bonds lost 2.8
percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  The August rally in Treasuries, the sharpest monthly
advance since the depths of the financial crisis in December
2008, came as bond investors cut expectations for inflation.  Inflation Rate  The break-even inflation rate, the yield difference between
10-year Treasury notes and inflation-indexed U.S.  government
bonds  of similar tenor, was 2.10 percentage points today, after
falling to 1.96 percentage points on Aug. 18, the lowest since
October. It has averaged 2.06 percentage points during the past
five years.  The Labor Department is likely to say the economy added
68,000 jobs in August, compared with 117,000 in July, according
to the median forecast of 84 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey before tomorrow’s report.  Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the slow pace
of hiring recently in the U.S. led them to cut their August
payroll forecast to a 25,000 gain. The revised estimate is down
from a prior projection of a 50,000 increase, the economists
said.  A few Fed policy makers, who weren’t identified, “felt
that recent economic developments justified a more substantial
move” beyond the pledge adopted at the Aug. 9 meeting of the
 Federal Open Market Committee  to hold its key  interest rate  at a
record low at least until mid-2013, the minutes said.  Fed Discussions  Fed officials discussed a range of tools, including buying
more government bonds to bolster the economy without coming to
an agreement on what they might do next should the economy
weaken further. They will more fully debate their options when
they gather Sept. 20-21 for a two-day meeting that was
originally scheduled to last one day.  “There’s been an acknowledgement or concession from the
Fed that any talk of an exit is gone,” said Richard Gilhooly,
an interest rate strategist at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD
Securities unit in New York. “The market is dysfunctional,
awaiting their every move. The market will be expecting the Fed
to act or not act based on that one employment number.”  The ISM’s factory index fell to 50.6 last month, the
lowest level since July 2009, from 50.9 in July, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said today. Economists projected the gauge
would drop to 48.5, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  Jobless claims fell by 12,000 to 409,000 in the week ended
Aug. 27, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a drop to
410,000, according to the median forecast. The figure remains
higher than it was three weeks earlier, before the labor dispute
at Verizon Communications Inc. pushed the numbers up.  A manufacturing gauge based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the 17-nation euro region fell to 49 from 50.4 in
July, Markit Economics said today. That’s below an initial
estimate of 49.7 published on Aug. 23. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
