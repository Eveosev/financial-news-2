Japanese stocks rose for a sixth day,
the longest winning streak in almost two months, after reports
showed manufacturing activity expanded in the U.S. and China,
boosting the outlook for exporters and machinery makers.  Sony Corp. (6758) , which earns 20 percent of its sales in the U.S.,
advanced 2 percent. Construction-machinery firms such as  Fanuc
Corp. (6954)  and  Komatsu Ltd. (6301)  advanced after JPMorgan Chase & Co.
initiated coverage on the sector with a “neutral” rating.
Steelmakers rose the most in the Topix index after a newspaper
reported the stronger yen and lower resources prices will trim
raw material costs for them.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 1.2 percent to 9,060.80
as of the 3 p.m. trading close in  Tokyo . The broader Topix index
gained 1 percent to 778.28.  “The stock market has priced in concerns that the  U.S.
economy  would approach a recession without policy response, but
recent economic reports haven’t deteriorated much,” said
 Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about $600 million in Tokyo at
Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. “Stocks have been oversold,
and we will see how much rebound they can get.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  fell 8.9 percent in August, its biggest
monthly loss since May 2010, amid concern U.S. growth is
sputtering and  Europe ’s debt crisis will damage the banking
system, damping demand in two of Japan’s biggest export markets.
The decline has cut the price of shares on the index to 1.1
times book value, near the lowest since April 2009.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. In  New York , the index rose 0.5 percent yesterday,
paring its August decline to 5.7 percent, the biggest monthly
retreat since May 2010.  U.S. Factory Orders  Orders placed with U.S. factories rose 2.4 percent in July,
the most in four months, Commerce Department figures showed
yesterday. Vehicle orders climbed last month by the most since
January 2003, rebounding from a slump caused by supply
disruptions linked to the earthquake in  Japan .  The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago Inc. said
yesterday its business barometer fell to 56.5 in August, from
58.8 in July, still exceeding the highest estimate of 51
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Exporters to the U.S. advanced, with electric appliance
makers giving the most support to the Topix. Sony gained 2
percent to 1,698 yen. Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more
than 40 percent of its revenue in  North America , rose 3.4
percent to 2,557 yen.  Sony also rose after Executive Deputy President  Kazuo Hirai 
said in Berlin the company will merge its networks for music,
video and games into a re-branded Sony Entertainment Network.
Sony Chief Executive Officer  Howard Stringer  said sales are
higher than before a hacker attack on its network earlier this
year.  Machinery Makers  Fanuc, which makes factory-automation systems and equipment,
rose 2.8 percent to 12,970 yen, after JPMorgan initiated
coverage of 10 Japanese machinery stocks, naming Fanuc as its
“top pick” because of earnings potential driven by growth from
emerging countries. Komatsu, Japan’s largest maker of
construction equipment, advanced 4.2 percent to 2,109 yen, the
second biggest boost to the Topix index, after JPMorgan set a
price target of 2,900 yen on the stock.  A Chinese manufacturing index stayed near the borderline
between expansion and contraction in August, signaling limits
for more monetary tightening. The Purchasing Managers’ Index was
at 50.9, from the 29-month low of 50.7 in July, the  China 
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said in a statement today.
That compared with the median estimate of 51 in a Bloomberg News
survey of 14 economists. A reading above 50 indicates an
expansion.  Steelmakers gained 2.6 percent, the biggest advance among
the 33 Topix industry groups, after the Nikkei newspaper
reported today the stronger yen and lower resources prices will
trim raw material costs for  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) ,  Sumitomo Metal
Industries Ltd. (5405) ,  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  and  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)   Nippon Steel increased 3.1 percent to 236 yen. JFE advanced
2.8 percent to 1,816 yen. Sumitomo Metal Industries climbed 2.5
percent to 164 yen. Kobe Steel gained 2.8 percent to 146 yen.  Denso Corp. (6902) , a manufacturer of electronic parts for
automobiles, gained 2.6 percent to 2,490 yen after Credit Suisse
started coverage of Japanese autoparts makers with a rating of
“overweight,” saying the market will re-evaluate Japanese
autoparts makers once European and U.S. financial issues
stabilize along with a slowing of the yen’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
