HSH Nordbank AG sued  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  to recover damages it incurred after buying $159 million
in mortgage-backed securities from the New York bank that
allegedly were less safe an investment than advertised.  Mortgage loans  underlying the securities posed a greater
credit risk and were more prone to default than represented,
Hamburg-based HSH Nordbank said in a summons filed yesterday in
New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan. Offering materials
contained “misrepresentations and omissions” regarding
underwriting standards for the loans, it said.  “The securities have performed worse than expected due to
the poorer-quality collateral, and defendants’ wrongdoing has
led directly to the plaintiffs’ damages,” said the German
lender, which was bailed out during the financial crisis.  HSH Nordbank said it’s seeking damages of at least
$42 million.  Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined comment on
the lawsuit.  The case is HSH Nordbank AG v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA,
652416-2011, New York State  Supreme Court  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
