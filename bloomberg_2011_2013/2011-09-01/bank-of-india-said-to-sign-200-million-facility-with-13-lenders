Bank of India (BOI) , a state-owned lender,

Group Ltd., Bank of America Corp., Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.,
Natixis, Standard Chartered Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, and United Overseas Bank Ltd., which committed $23 million
each, the person said, asking not to be identified as details

Bank Co. committed $9.5 million each, while Bank of Taiwan, Bank
of Kaohsiung, Hua Nan Commercial Bank Ltd. and Taiwan
Cooperative Bank committed $5 million each, the person said.  The facility pays a so-called all-in rate of 150 basis
