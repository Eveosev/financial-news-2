Ghana ’s cedi may strengthen the most
since March by the end of this month after the central bank
decided to hold its key lending rate today, according to
Standard Bank Group Ltd.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
will gain as much as 0.3 percent, according to Chris Nettey, a
currency trader at the local unit of the lender. According to
data compiled by Bloomberg, the cedi would appreciate to 1.5233
per dollar, from a close of 1.5279 on Aug. 30. The currency was
last at that rate on March 14, when it closed at 1.5235,
according to the data.  The Bank of Ghana maintained the policy rate at 12.5
percent, Governor Kwesi Amissah-Arthur told reporters, citing
rising inflationary pressures following an increase in utility
prices this week.  “Investors will see the rate decision as an opportunity
for better yields,” Nettey said by phone. “It shows that the
 Bank of Ghana  wants to keep inflation in the coming months under
control, and hence any depreciation in the currency due to
inflation.”  Ghana’s three-month borrowing costs are 9.26 percent, the
lowest since Nov. 9, 2007, when Bloomberg began tracking yield.
The cedi traded at 1.5282 per dollar by 4:12 p.m. local time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
