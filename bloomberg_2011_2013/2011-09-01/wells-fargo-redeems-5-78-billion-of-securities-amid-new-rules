Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the fourth-
largest U.S. bank, said it plans to redeem $5.78 billion of
securities with cash on hand after new financial rules triggered
a clause allowing the lender to repay the instruments.  “This action constitutes a redemption as a result of a
‘Capital Treatment Event’ under the securities’ governing
instruments,” San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said today in a
regulatory filing. “The company has determined that a capital
treatment event occurred with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
