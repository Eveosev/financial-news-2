Spar Nord Bank A/S, Denmark’s
fourth-largest listed lender, received a 40 million-euro ($57
million) loan from the  European Investment Bank  to help offset
the impact of higher funding costs on business loans.  The funds are earmarked for lending to small and medium-
sized enterprises which are “especially significant” for the
Danish economy, Luxembourg-based EIB said today in a statement.  Denmark’s government has proposed new legislation to
sidestep the country’s bank resolution laws, the toughest in the
European Union, after two  bank failures  this year sparked senior
creditor losses and left most Danish lenders facing a funding
wall. Spar Nord said last month it will sell its leasing
business, raising cash to cover the repayment of state-
guaranteed bonds due by 2013.  “The market price for money has risen and this means it is
highly advantageous to borrow at the terms which the European
Investment Bank offers,” Kim Christensen, credit director at
Aalborg, Denmark-based Spar Nord, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
