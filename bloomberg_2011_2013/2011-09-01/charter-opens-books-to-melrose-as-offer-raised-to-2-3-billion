Charter International Plc (CHTR) , a welding
and automation-equipment maker, opened its books to  Melrose Plc (MRO) 
after the U.K. investment firm raised a possible takeover offer
to 1.43 billion pounds ($2.3 billion).  Melrose sweetened its proposal by 10 pence to 850 pence a
share, winning it access to its data room, Charter said in a
statement on Regulatory News Service. Melrose’s new cash-and-
share proposal would also let Charter shareholders keep an 8-
pence interim dividend declared on July 26 and payable tomorrow.  “The board of Charter will give consideration to whether
it should recommend to shareholders the terms proposed by
Melrose as set out above, should Melrose notify Charter of a
firm intention to make an offer on these terms,” Charter said
in the statement.  Melrose’s move follows the emergence of an unidentified
rival suitor. Charter said Aug. 23 that it had entered talks
with the potential alternative bidder and that discussions were
at an early stage. Melrose is an investment vehicle created by a
former management team of industrial conglomerate Wassall Plc.  Charter, registered in  Jersey  with headquarters in Dublin,
previously turned down two proposed cash-and-share offers from
Melrose, the last at 840 pence per share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
