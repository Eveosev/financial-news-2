Petroleos Mexicanos  said its accord
with  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s largest investor doesn’t call for a change
in management at the oil driller though it’s possible, El Pais
reported, citing an unidentified person at the Mexican company.  A change in leadership at Repsol is not being sought, “but
it´s true that now this is one possibility in the short term,”
the newspaper quoted the person as saying.  The agreement between Pemex, a Repsol shareholder, and
 Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , the largest stockholder, to vote in a
bloc on decisions affecting the Spanish oil company responds to
a changed environment, “and we´re capitalizing on that,” the
person said, without explaining in more detail, according to El
Pais.  The accord calls for Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Antonio Brufau to give up one of his roles, according to an Aug.
29 statement by Pemex and Sacyr.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
