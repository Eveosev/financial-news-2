Mississippi  lawmakers will consider
Friday a $75 million incentive package for CaliSolar Inc., a
company seeking to make silicon for solar cells at half its
current cost.  Mississippi Governor  Haley Barbour  will ask the legislature
Friday to approve incentives to bring the plant, which will
require at least $600 million in private investment, to
Columbus, Mississippi, he said in a statement on his 
website yesterday. The plant will create 951 full-time jobs.  CaliSolar, which processes lower cost silicon into high-
purity silicon, was offered a $275 million conditional loan
guarantee by the U.S. Energy Department in June to build its
factory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
