Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW
brand in August expandened its sales lead over  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s
Mercedes-Benz and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Lexus , delivering the
most luxury models in the U.S. for a fifth straight month.  BMW’s U.S. sales, helped by deliveries of the new 5-Series
sedan and X3 sport-utility vehicle, rose 6.5 percent last month
compared with a year earlier to 20,815, the Munich-based
automaker said yesterday in a statement. The results bring BMW a
step closer to being 2011’s top-selling U.S. luxury brand and
ending Lexus’s 11-year streak.  Mercedes sales fell 1.9 percent to 18,477 in August while
Lexus fell 7 percent to 18,103 as the Japanese make continued to
suffer from inventory disruptions following the March earthquake
and tsunami.  “This has been a very strange August for our industry with
both difficult news and unfortunate events --  consumer
confidence  down and an earthquake, hurricane and floods in the
Northeast” Jim O’Donnell, head of BMW of  North America , said in
a statement.  BMW expanded its sales lead for the year with a 12 percent
increase through August to 155,929. Deliveries of Stuttgart,
Germany-based Mercedes vehicles rose 6.1 percent to 148,409 in
the U.S. while Lexus’s fell 17 percent to 120,652. Toyota is
based in Toyota City,  Japan .  The results exclude Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart cars
and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t luxury vehicles.  5-Series Boost  BMW’s surge in August included a 41 percent increase in
sales of the 5-Series models and deliveries of the X3 more than
doubling to 2,382 from 892 a year earlier.  BMW’s incentive spending rose 21 percent compared with a
year ago to an average of $3,566 while Mercedes spending fell 11
percent to $3,406, according to TrueCar.com, a website that
tracks auto sales and prices.  BMW is being aggressive about its use of incentive
spending, said  Jesse Toprak , an industry analyst with TrueCar.
He noticed a $299 a month lease special for a 3-Series last
month and figured BMW was subsidizing the estimated resale value
by 10 percentage points to get to that level, he said.  “They’re being aggressive: $299 a month for a 3-Series
versus what you’re going to get for an Accord?” he said. “Of
course you’re going to get” a BMW.  BMW is selling down 3-Series inventory before offering a
new version next year, as well as trying to secure the sales
race victory over Mercedes, he said.  Bigger Discounts  Lexus’s return to full production is likely to mean more
incentive spending in the luxury market during the last part of
the year, said Kurt McNeil, Cadillac’s vice president of sales.  “You’re starting to see them stir up the luxury space,”
he said yesterday in a telephone interview.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac luxury brand sales rose 4.1
percent last month to 13,208, according to the Detroit based
automaker.  U.S. deliveries of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand rose 11
percent to 10,201 vehicles last month, the Wolfsburg, Germany-
based company said in a statement.  Porsche AG, the Stuttgart-based automaker merging with
Volkswagen, sold 2,184 vehicles in the U.S., a 7.5 percent
increase, the company said yesterday in an e-mail.  Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti sold 9,024 vehicles, a 4.3
percent decline from a year earlier,  Katherine Zachary , a
spokeswoman for the Yokohama, Japan-based company, said
yesterday in a telephone interview.  Honda Motor Co., based in Tokyo, said in a statement that
sales for its Acura brand fell 22 percent to 9,054 last month.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 8,006 Lincolns in August, a 25 percent
increase from a year earlier, according to a statement from the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Land Rover deliveries rose 10 percent to 2,807, while
Jaguar sales fell 43 percent to 810, Mumbai-based  Tata Motors
Ltd. (TTMT)  said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
