Damage to eurozone banks’ balance
sheets from holding Irish, Greek, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish
and Belgian sovereign debt may amount to as much as 200 billion
euros ($286 billion) according to one estimate by International
Monetary Fund staff, the Financial Times reported, citing two
unidentified IMF officials.  That would be a drop of 10 percent to 12 percent in the
banks’ tangible common equity, the core measure of their capital
bases, the newspaper said.  A draft of the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report,
which uses credit default swap prices to estimate the market
value of the six countries’ government debt, has put IMF
officials and European authorities at loggerheads, with the
 European Central Bank  and eurozone governments dismissing the
document as partial and misleading, the FT said.  The analysis, which was due to be discussed yesterday by
the IMF’s board, may be revised, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
