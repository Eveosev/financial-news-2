Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  Europe ’s
largest  oil company , will sell its stake in  Norway ’s natural gas
pipeline for 3.9 billion kroner ($723 million) to a unit of
 Canada ’s  Public Sector Pension Investment Board .  Shell will sell its 5 percent interest in Gassled to
Infragas Norge AS, owned by the pension fund with C$58 billion
($59.4 billion) under management, the oil company said today in
a statement. The sale also includes Shell’s 3.3 percent stake in
Dunkerque Terminal and 2.5 percent in Zeepipe Terminal.  “This sale is a further step in our strategy of exiting
non-strategic assets and focusing on major growth projects,”
David Loughman, managing director of Shell’s Norway unit, said
in the statement.  Gassled, a venture created in 2003 between energy companies
operating offshore Norway, owns the transport facilities of the
world’s second-biggest gas exporter. Earlier this year,  Allianz
SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest insurer, bought stakes in Gassled from
 Total SA (FP)  and  Statoil ASA (STL)  to expand infrastructure investment.
 Canada Pension Plan Investment Board  and the Abu Dhabi
Investment Authority participated in the transaction with
Statoil along with Allianz.  Last year,  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  agreed to sell its interest in
Gassled to Njord Gas Infrastructure AS, which is a subsidiary of
UBS International Infrastructure Fund and CDC Infrastructure SA.  Shell expects to close its sale in the fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
