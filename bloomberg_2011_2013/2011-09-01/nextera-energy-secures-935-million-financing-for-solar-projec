(Corrects to say generating capacity in last paragraph of
a story first published yesterday.)  NextEra Energy Resources LLC, the
largest wind-energy producer in the U.S., secured financing of
$935 million in project bonds for a  California  solar project.  The Genesis project, run by NextEraâ€™s unit Genesis Solar
LLC and located on public land in Riverside County, California,
will have a capacity of 250 megawatts, the company said in a
 statement . It is scheduled to enter operation in 2014 and will
supply power to California utility Pacific Gas & Electric Co.  The U.S. Department of Energy has provided a loan guarantee
of 80 percent of the principal and interest on the project bonds
and project term loan. Credit Suisse served as the lender, while
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria  provided the letter of credit
facility, according to the statement.  NextEra, based in  Juno Beach ,  Florida , is the largest
generator of wind and solar power in the U.S., according to the
company. It had total revenue of $15.3 billion last year and a
capacity of 43,000 megawatts of generating energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
