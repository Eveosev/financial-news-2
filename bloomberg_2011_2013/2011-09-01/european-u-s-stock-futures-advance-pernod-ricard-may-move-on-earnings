European stocks rallied for a fourth
day, the longest stretch of gains in more than month, after a
report showed U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly expanded in
August, boosting optimism in the world’s largest economy.  Royal Bank of Scotland Plc soared 8.2 percent following a
report that U.K. lawmakers may delay a regulatory overhaul of
lenders.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  gained 5.2 percent as Mosaid Technologies
Inc. bought a portfolio of patents from the biggest mobile phone
maker by volume.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.6 percent to 238.93
at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending the previous day’s
2.9 percent gain. The benchmark measure declined 11 percent in
August, its largest monthly retreat since October 2008.  “The data wasn’t as bad as feared and back into
expansionary territory,” said Ioan Smith, a director at Knight
Capital Europe Ltd. in London. “We got the instant positive
reaction in the market that you would expect, but this reflects
little change to the anemic pace of growth in manufacturing.”  Benchmark indexes climbed in 14 out of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  rose 0.5 percent and
 France ’s CAC 40 Index gained 0.3 percent.  Germany ’s DAX Index
slid 0.9 percent.  A report showed that U.S. manufacturing unexpectedly
expanded in August. Economists had predicted that the gauge
would fall for the first time in two years.  U.S. Manufacturing Climbs  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s manufacturing index
slipped to 50.6 last month from 50.9 in July, less than the
plunge to 48.5 that 80 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had
predicted. The dividing line between expansion and contraction
is 50, a level that the gauge last fell below in July 2009.  A Labor Department report showed that initial jobless
claims in the week ending Aug. 26 slid to 409,000.  Spain  sold 3.62 billion euros ($5.2 billion) of five-year
bonds. Demand fell at the Spanish sale, with investors bidding
for 1.76 times the amount of debt on offer, compared with a so-
called bid-to-cover of 2.85 times at an offering of similar-
maturity securities in July.  British banks rose after the Financial Times reported that
the U.K. government will probably delay a regulatory overhaul
until after the next general election to avoid tighter credit
policies affecting the economy. RBS surged 8.2 percent to 26.25
pence,  Barclays Plc (BARC)  jumped 5.6 percent to 180.35 pence and
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  rallied 6.2 percent to 35.67 pence.  Nokia rose 5.2 percent to 4.73 euros as  Canada ’s Mosaid
Technologies acquired a portfolio of about 2,000 patents and
patent applications originally filed by Nokia for an undisclosed
sum. Deutsche Telekom climbed 3 percent to 9.07 euros after
tumbling more than 7 percent yesterday.  Iliad, Charter International  Iliad SA (ILD)  gained 2.4 percent to 85.54 euros after confirming
its short- and medium-term forecasts. The broadband provider
setting up France’s fourth mobile-phone network also posted
first-half net income of 145 million euros, beating the average
analyst estimate of 134 million euros.  Charter International Plc (CHTR)  jumped 4.7 percent to 799 pence
after the British engineering group said that Melrose Plc
sweetened its proposal by 10 pence to 850 pence a share.  “The board of Charter will give consideration to whether
it should recommend to shareholders the terms proposed by
Melrose as set out above, should Melrose notify Charter of a
firm intention to make an offer on these terms,” Charter said
in the statement.  Lagardere, Temenos  Lagardere SCA (MMB)  tumbled 11 percent to 21.16 euros after
France’s biggest publisher predicted that recurring media
earnings for the year will drop 5 to 7 percent. The owner of the
Europe 1 radio station posted a 41 percent decline in first-half
profit. Net income adjusted for some items dropped to 57 million
euros from 97 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based
company said yesterday in a statement after the market closed.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  retreated 4.5 percent to 16.95 Swiss
francs after Deutsche Bank AG recommended selling the Swiss
financial software provider’s shares.  Eiffage SA (FGR)  slumped 18 percent to 27.94 euros, the largest
slide on the Stoxx 600, after posting first-half net income of
43 million euros, compared with 70 million euros a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
