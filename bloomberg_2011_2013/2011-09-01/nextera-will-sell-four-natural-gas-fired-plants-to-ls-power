NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , the largest U.S.
generator of wind power, agreed to sell four natural-gas-fired
power plants to an affiliate of LS Power for $1.05 billion.  The transaction includes plants in  California , Alabama,
 South Carolina  and Virginia with a combined capacity of more
than 2,100 megawatts, Juno Beach, Florida-based NextEra said in
a regulatory filing today. The sale is expected to be accretive
to earnings per share in future years, the company said.  NextEra Chief Financial Officer Armando Pimentel said in
April that the company was exploring a sale of five gas-fueled
plants to take advantage of rising interest in electricity
generated by the fossil fuel. The company said today that it
will “continue to explore options” for a fifth power facility,
which is located in  Rhode Island .  An affiliate of NextEra’s competitive energy unit
initially will keep operating three of the facilities in the
sale for five years and the fourth location for two years,
according to today’s regulatory filing. NextEra said it expects
net cash proceeds of about $500 million after the repayment of
debt and costs for the deal.  NextEra said the transaction will result in a one-time
charge of about $97 million, which it plans to exclude from
adjusted earnings. The transaction is expected to close in the
fourth quarter, if necessary approvals are received, the company
said.  Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG advised a NextEra
unit on the transaction, and  Hogan Lovells  acted as outside
legal counsel, according to a statement from NextEra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
