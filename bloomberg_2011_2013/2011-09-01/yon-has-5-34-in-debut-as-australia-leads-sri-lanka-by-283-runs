Nathan Lyon claimed five wickets in
his debut to help  Australia  establish a 283-run lead over  Sri
Lanka  on day two of their opening cricket Test in Galle.  Lyon had a wicket with his opening delivery and finished
with 5-34 as Sri Lanka was bowled out for 105 in its first
innings in response to the visitors’ 273 all out. Australia then
collapsed to 115-6 before bad light ended play.  The 23-year-old off-spinner was working as a groundsman at
the Adelaide Oval less than eight months ago. He became only the
second Australian to take a wicket with his first delivery in
Test cricket as captain  Michael Clarke  took a diving catch at
slip to dismiss Kumar Sangakkara, leaving the host on 24-2.  “It’s been one of the best days of my life,” Lyon said in
a news conference. “To be able to take five wickets on debut is
something special that I’m going to hold pretty close to my
heart.”  Shane Watson took 3-11 and newcomer Trent Copeland claimed
a wicket in his first over as Australia made an early
breakthrough when captain Tillakaratne Dilshan was caught by
 Ricky Ponting .  Sri Lanka fought back to take six Australian wickets before
the close, with Rangana Herath on 3-51.  Fifth-ranked Australia would move above Sri Lanka into
fourth in the International Cricket Council’s Test Championship
 standings  by winning the best-of-three contest. It’s Australia’s
first elite Test since January and Clarke’s first Test as
captain since replacing Ponting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
