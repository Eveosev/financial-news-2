U.K. 10-year bonds rose for the
first time in three days as stocks declined and an industry
report showed  home prices  unexpectedly dropped in August,
boosting demand for the perceived safety of government debt.  Ten-year yields fell from the highest level in three weeks
as investors reduced bets that the  Bank of England  will raise
 interest rates . The average price of a house slipped 0.6
percent, after gaining 0.3 percent in July,  Nationwide Building
Society  said. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast prices
to be unchanged. The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slid as much as 0.9 percent.
U.S. stocks swung between gains and losses, with the Standard
and Poor’s 500 Index falling as much as 0.5 percent.  “We are seeing safe-haven flows and gilts are also on the
front foot,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at
Commerzbank AG in  London . “The whole data picture is
discouraging overall, and obviously that’s creating a nice
tailwind and that’s why gilts are firmer.”  Ten-year gilt yields fell six basis points to 2.54 percent
at 4:17 p.m. in London, after rising to 2.64 percent earlier
today, the highest since Aug. 10. The 3.75 percent bond due
September 2020 rose 0.515, or 5.15 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,616) face amount, to 109.680. The two-year yield dropped
four basis points to 0.56 percent.  Gilts have handed investors a 7.2 percent return this year,
compared with 5.2 percent from German debt and 7.2 percent from
Treasuries, according to the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. U.K. debt gained 2.7 percent in August, the
indexes show.  Manufacturing Shrinks  U.K. manufacturing contracted the most in more than two
years in August, according to a gauge based on a survey by
 Markit Economics  and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply . The reading fell to 49 from 49.4 in July, according to
an e-mailed report. A level below 50 indicates contraction. New
orders fell the most in almost 2 1/2 years.  Short-sterling futures advanced, leaving the implied yield
on the contract expiring in December one basis point lower at 1
percent, indicating traders are reducing wagers on higher U.K.
borrowing costs. The central bank kept its benchmark rate at 0.5
percent on Aug. 4.  Britain sold 3 billion pounds of 3.75 percent bonds
maturing in 2021 today, attracting bids for 1.99 times the
amount of debt on offer.  Pound Gains  The pound strengthened for a second day against the euro
after a report showed European manufacturing shrank more than
initially estimated in August.  A manufacturing gauge based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the euro region fell to 49 from 50.4 in July, Markit
said today. That was below an initial estimate of 49.7 published
on Aug. 23. European confidence in the economic outlook plunged
the most since December 2008 last month, the European Commission
said Aug. 30.  “It’s probably correct to say that the balance of news has
been negative, but it’s been more so in other parts of the
world, the  euro zone  in particular,” said  Adam Cole , head of
global currency strategy in London at Royal Bank of Canada, the
nation’s largest lender. “There’s already a lot of bad news in
the price of sterling already.”  The pound strengthened 0.3 percent to 88.19 pence per euro,
after depreciating to 88.85 pence yesterday, the weakest level
since Aug. 10. Sterling fell for a third day against the dollar,
losing 0.6 percent to $1.6166. It lost 1.7 percent to 1.2871
Swiss francs, a third day of declines.  Investors should sell the pound against the Swiss franc
because the Bank of England will likely resume asset purchases,
which would override support from the country’s AAA rating,
according to BNP Paribas SA.  “We believe that yield differentials and central bank
policy will dominate all other factors, leaving the pound
vulnerable to further downside,”  Mary Nicola , a strategist at
BNP Paribas in  New York , wrote in a client note today. “With
the U.K.’s fiscal hands tied, deterioration of the economic data
will force monetary policy to do more heavy lifting.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
