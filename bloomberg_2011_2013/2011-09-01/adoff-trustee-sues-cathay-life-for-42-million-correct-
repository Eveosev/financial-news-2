Irving H. Picard, the trustee
liquidating Bernard L. Madoff’s money management firm, sued two
units of Cathay Financial Holding Co. for $41.7 million.  Picard filed the suit today in  U.S. bankruptcy court  in New
York. The two units of Taiwan’s largest listed financial-
services company invested with Madoff through a Fairfield
Greenwich Group fund, Fairfield Sentry, according to the filing.
Fairfield Sentry transferred about $24.5 million to Cathay Life
Insurance and about $17.2 million to Cathay United Bank,
according to Picard.  “The Cathay defendants knowingly received transfers of
customer property from” Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC, Picard wrote.  Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence for running
the biggest  Ponzi scheme  in history.  Alan Lee, a Cathay Financial spokesperson, couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment after Taipei business hours.  The case is Picard v. Cathay Life Insurance Co., 11-ap-
2568, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
