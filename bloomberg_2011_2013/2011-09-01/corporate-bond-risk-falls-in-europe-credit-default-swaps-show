The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt rose, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments rose three basis points to 294 at 12:30 p.m. in
London. An increase signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit
quality .  Swaps on  Greece  jumped 72 basis points to 2,305, according
to CMA. Ireland climbed seven to 775, Italy increased nine to
370 and Portugal was 16 higher at 930, while  Spain  rose eight to
365. France was up two basis points at 155 and  Germany  was
unchanged at 75.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 1.5
basis points to 646.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings was unchanged at 152.75  basis points.  The cost of insuring bank bonds fell, with the Markit
iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of 25 banks and
insurers down one basis point to 230 and the subordinated index
12 lower at 413.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
