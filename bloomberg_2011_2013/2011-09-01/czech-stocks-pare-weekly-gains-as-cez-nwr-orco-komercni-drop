The Czech Republic’s benchmark stock
index fell, paring this week’s gains as power utility  CEZ AS (CEZ) ,
mining company New World Resources Plc, developer  Orco Property
Group (ORC)  SA and  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  retreated.  The PX gauge of 14 companies slumped 1.2 percent to 1,035.9
as of 10:13 a.m. in  Prague , heading for its biggest one-day drop
in almost two weeks. The index was still 2.1 percent up from the
end of last week.  European shares fell before a U.S. report that may show
manufacturing in the world’s largest economy contracted for the
first time in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
