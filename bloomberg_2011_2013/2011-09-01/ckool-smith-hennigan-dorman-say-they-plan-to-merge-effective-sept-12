Litigation law firms Hennigan Dorman
LLP and  McKool Smith  PC said they will merge Sept. 12 to create
a firm with 168 lawyers in seven offices nationwide.  The new firm will be known as McKool Smith and will operate
in  California  as McKool Smith Hennigan, the firms said yesterday
in a  statement . The deal helps McKool to expand its roster of
lawyers and strengthen its national footprint, co-founder Mike McKool said yesterday in the statement.  “This is a very exciting moment for both firms,” said
McKool, who is also chairman. “Hennigan Dorman has a fantastic
reputation and a track record of success in complex
litigation.”  The merger is the sixth announced in less than a month and
continues a trend toward smaller deals, according to industry
consultant Altman Weil Inc.  Counting today’s announcement, 39 firms have announced
merger plans so far this year compared with 22 firms at this
time last year, according to Altman Weil’s MergerLine. Altman
said in July that a majority of the deals involved acquisition
of firms with 20 or fewer lawyers.  Hennigan Dorman, based in  Los Angeles , represented Orange
County, California, in lawsuits against more than a dozen
securities firms in the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S.
history. Dallas-based McKool, a prominent patent litigation
firm, secured more than $1 billion in courtroom verdicts,
judgments and settlements during the first six months of this
year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
