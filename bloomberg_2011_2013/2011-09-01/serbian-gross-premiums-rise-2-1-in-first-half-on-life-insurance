Serbia ’s insurance market expanded
2.1 percent in the first half to 30.6 billion dinars ($432.9
million) as premiums from  life insurance  policies grew more than
the non-life segment.  Gross written premiums form life insurance increased almost
11 percent to 4.71 billion dinars from 4.26 billion dinars a
year ago, Serbia’s central bank, which regulates and monitors
the industry, said in a statement on its  website . Premiums from
other policies, including the most common vehicle and property
insurance, grew marginally to 25.89 billion dinars.  Three leading insurers,  Dunav Osiguranje AD (DNOS) ,  DDOR Novi Sad
AD and Delta Osiguranje AD, a unit of  Assicurazioni Generali
SpA (G) , continued to control more than half of the market. Their
combined market share even increased to 58.3 percent over the
first six months from 56.1 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
