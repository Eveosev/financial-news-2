Ralph Schlosstein, chief executive
officer of  Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR) , said U.S. antitrust laws
should be interpreted “more broadly.”  Evercore is among firms advising  AT&T Inc. (T)  on its $39
billion takeover of T-Mobile USA, which the U.S.  Justice
Department  filed suit yesterday to block. The deal is one of the
rare instances in recent years where the Justice Department has
actively sought to derail through a lawsuit or an informal
threat to sue. Other instances include Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and
IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s offer for NYSE Euronext.  “In many of these businesses, the competition is global,
and some of our policies and laws are written to look
exclusively or predominantly at the U.S. market alone,”
Schlosstein said today in an interview with Betty Liu on
Bloomberg Television. “We have to look a little bit more
broadly.”  If the AT&T deal collapses, Evercore, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
and Greenhill & Co., the advisers to AT&T on its purchase, could
miss out on sharing a fee as much as $80 million, according to
New York-based research firm Freeman & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
