The yen’s rise against the dollar
will hurt earnings of Japanese companies and cause them to
increase purchases of raw materials and parts from overseas, a
government report today said.  About 15 percent of large manufacturing companies expect
operating profit to drop 20 percent or more with an exchange
rate of 76 yen per dollar, according to a survey of 61 such
firms, the  Ministry  of Economy, Trade & Industry said today in a
 statement . The government surveyed 154 small, medium and large
companies from Aug. 22 to 26.  Japan ’s currency has climbed 5.5 percent this year against
the dollar, reaching a post-World War II record of 75.95 per
dollar on Aug. 19. To cope with the yen’s rise, 67 percent of
large manufacturers will cut costs and 65 percent will hedge
exchange rates, the METI survey said.  If the rate of 76 yen per dollar remains for more than six
months, more than 50 percent of large manufacturers will
increase overseas purchases of materials and parts and 46
percent will move factories and research and development centers
abroad, it said.  Almost 90 percent of the manufacturers want Japan to reduce
corporate taxes, while 63 percent have asked for the government
to intervene the foreign exchange market, 50 percent have demand
stable power supply and 47 percent have wanted support for
plants and research centers, it said.  To contact the reporter for this story: Jae Hur in Tokyo at +81-
