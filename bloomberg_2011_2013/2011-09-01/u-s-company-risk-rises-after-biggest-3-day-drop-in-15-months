A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
credit risk rose, snapping three days of declines, as investors
prepared for a jobs report that may show August payrolls
increased less than in July.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose by 2.8 basis points to a
mid-price of 117.3 basis points as of 5:33 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  A Labor Department report tomorrow may show non-farm
payrolls climbed by 68,000 after a 117,000 increase in July,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.â€™s Jan Hatzius cut his
forecast for the gain to 25,000 from 50,000.  The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, fell 11.7
basis points in the prior three days, the biggest decline since
May 2010, as investor speculation mounted that the  Federal
Reserve  would take additional steps to stimulate the economy
amid signs of slowing growth.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  Editor: Pierre Paulden  To contact the reporter on this story:
