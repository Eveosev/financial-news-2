Treasuries erased gains after a
report showing unexpected growth in manufacturing industries
bolstered optimism about economic growth.  U.S. 10-year yields fell earlier, adding to the biggest
decline last month since December 2008, after reports showed
U.S. initial jobless claims were almost as forecast last week
and European manufacturing shrank more than initially estimated
in August. Minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s Aug. 9 meeting
released Aug. 30 showed some policy makers urged action to
stimulate a sluggish economy, leading to speculation the central
bank may consider additional measures to boost the economy.  “The ISM came in extremely strong,” said Jason Rogan,
director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC,
a New York-based brokerage for institutional investors. “The
 bond market  was expecting a much worse number. It caught a lot
of people offsides. We’re seeing some very strong selling.”  Yields on 10-year notes rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.26 percent at 10:10 a.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the
2.125 percent security maturing August 2021 fell 11/32 or $3.44
to 98 25/32. The yield fell earlier as much as four basis
points.  Yields declined 57 basis points last month, the most since
a 71 basis-point drop in December 2008. The yield slid to a
record low of 1.97 percent on Aug. 18.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to
50.6 in August from 50.9 the prior month, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said today. A reading of 50 is the dividing line
between expansion and contraction in manufacturing.  Economists projected the gauge would drop to 48.5,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
Estimates of the 80 economists ranged from 44 to 52. A reading
above 42.5 generally indicates an expansion in the overall
economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
