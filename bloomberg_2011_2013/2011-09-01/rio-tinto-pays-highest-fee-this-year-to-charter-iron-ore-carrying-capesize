Rio Tinto Group paid this year’s
highest rent for a capesize vessel to carry iron ore to  China 
from  Australia , potentially signaling an end to slumping hire
costs for dry-bulk ships.  Charter rates for the route surged 12 percent to the
highest level in almost 10 months as Rio paid $10.30 for each
metric ton of ore hauled on a capesize, a booking list published
by the  Baltic Exchange  showed. The Baltic Dry Index, a broader
measure of commodity shipping costs, advanced 3.9 percent to
1,682, the highest level since Jan. 4.  The rate paid by London-based Rio, the world’s second-
biggest mining company, is 31 percent more than it was charged
to hire vessels on Aug. 2, according to the exchange, which
assesses rents on 29 dry-bulk routes. It also was the highest
rent since Nov. 11, exchange data showed. Rates for trans-
Atlantic voyages topped $40,000 for the first time this year.  “This might be the first development in the foundations of
a market recovery for the dry-bulk market,” Nicolai Hansteen,
an analyst at Oslo-based shipbroker Lorenzten & Stemoco AS, said
by phone today.  Average daily hire costs for capesizes, which account for
40 percent of the world dry-bulk fleet’s capacity, gained 12
percent to $21,901. Rents have more than doubled since Aug. 12,
arresting a decline in returns to below breakeven costs.  Indian Ore  Revived Japanese imports of  iron ore  and coal helped to
lift shipments as the nation rebuilds after March’s earthquake
and tsunami, Hansteen said. He also said curbs on Indian iron-
ore exports to China forced traders to seek other supplies at
the same time that higher fuel prices discouraged owners from
sending empty ships in  Asia  to the Atlantic Ocean region to seek
cargoes. That created a shortage of vessels to load Brazilian
ore and Colombian coal, Hansteen said.  Contracts used to bet on or hedge capesize rents in the
fourth quarter have jumped 42 percent since Aug. 29. The forward
freight agreements gained as much as 13 percent today after
yesterday’s 12 percent climb, according to Clarkson Securities
Ltd., a division of the world’s largest shipbroker.  Fourth-quarter FFAs traded at $18,925 a day by 2:27 p.m.
London time, Clarkson data showed.  Capesize rates averaged $8,391 a day in this year’s first
quarter and $8,737 in the following three months, data compiled
by Bloomberg shows. Those were the lowest levels since the
$7,489 registered in the final quarter of 2001. Rents averaged a
record $175,967 in 2007’s fourth quarter.  D/S Norden A/S,  Europe ’s largest publicly traded
commodities-shipping company, said Aug. 16 it needs $13,040 a
day to break even on its fleet of 132 bulk carriers.  Among the three other ship classes tracked by the index,
rents for panamaxes, the largest vessels that can navigate the
Panama Canal, fell 0.2 percent to $13,009 a day. Supramaxes
slipped 0.1 percent to $14,433 and handysizes were little
changed at $9,959.  To contact the reporter on this story:
