California-blend gasoline
strengthened for the second day after BP Plc was said to be
planning maintenance at its Carson refinery next week.  Carbob in  Los Angeles  rose 2.5 cents to a premium of 36.5
cents a gallon above gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 4:19 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery increased 4.14 cents
to $3.2577 a gallon.  London-based BP Plc plans to perform maintenance at its
266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery in southern  California  that
may result in flaring from Sept. 7 to Sept. 19, according to a
person familiar with the plant’s operations. The work isn’t
related to an equipment breakdown and isn’t expected to
significantly affect operations, the person said.  Motor gasoline inventories on the West Coast fell 3.3
percent to 27.8 million barrels in the week ended Aug. 26 from a
week earlier, according to the Energy Department. That’s the
lowest level for the region since July 2010.  The premium for Carbob in  San Francisco  also rose 2.5 cents
to 36.5 cents over futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland , Oregon, was
unchanged at 31 cents a gallon over futures, its largest premium
since July 23, 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
