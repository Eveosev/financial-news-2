rating downgrade by Standard & Poor’s after incurring
substantial losses on investments in drug wholesaler  Celesio AG (CLS1) 
and retailer  Metro AG (MEO) , Handelsblatt reported today, citing

weeks whether to downgrade it to “BB+” or “noninvestment-
grade” status, the newspaper said, citing S&P analyst Eric
