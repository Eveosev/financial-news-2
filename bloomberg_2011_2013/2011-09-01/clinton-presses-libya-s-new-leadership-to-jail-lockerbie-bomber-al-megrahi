Libya ’s new leaders understand U.S.
concern about the release of the Lockerbie bomber and offered
assurances that they will address the matter, Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton  said today.  Abdel-Baset al-Megrahi, convicted to life in prison for the
1988 Lockerbie bombing and released in 2009 on compassionate
grounds due to prostate cancer, “should be behind bars,” said
Clinton, speaking at the end of a one-day meeting in Paris of
nations that support the government formed by rebels who fought
against Muammar Qaddafi.  “We think justice was aborted,” she said. The United
States “categorically disagrees” with the decision by the
Scottish judiciary to release him and keeps the case against the
Libyan open, she said.  U.S. lawmakers have called on Libya’s new leaders to hold
al-Megrahi accountable for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103,
which killed 270 people. U.S. Senator  Charles Schumer , Democrat
of  New York , has demanded that the release of funds to Libya’s
National Transitional Council be contingent on returning him to
jail.  Many of the victims of the bombing came from New York
state, which Clinton represented for eight years in the  U.S.
Senate .  The Libyan rebel government has said it won’t deport al-
Megrahi, according to an Associated Press report.  Clinton raised the issue with NTC leaders during a private
meeting, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to
publicly discuss private diplomatic conversations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
