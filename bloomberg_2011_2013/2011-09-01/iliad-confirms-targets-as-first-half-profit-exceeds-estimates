Iliad SA (ILD) , the broadband provider
setting up France’s fourth mobile-phone network, confirmed its
financial targets as first-half profit exceeded estimates.  Net income fell to 145 million euros ($208 million) in the
first six months from 171.4 million euros a year earlier, Iliad
said in a statement. That compares with the average analyst
estimate of 134 million euros.  Iliad, founded by billionaire entrepreneur Xavier Niel, won
a mobile license in 2009 from the French government and is
scheduled to start operations next year. Niel has pledged to
drive down mobile prices in France, where  France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s
Orange,  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s SFR division and Bouygues Telecom SA
dominate the market.  The company’s Free broadband division had 342,000 more
subscribers than a year earlier in the first half, Iliad said.
In advance of the company’s entry into the mobile market, its
broadband competitors have tried to eat into its market share
with so-called “quadruple play” packages combining home phone,
Internet, TV, and mobile service Iliad can’t yet match.  Iliad today repeated it aims to cover 27 percent of  France 
with its Free Mobile network before January and double revenue
by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
