Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP)  said Kim Joong Kyum, the former head of Hyundai Engineering &
Construction Co., has been named chief executive officer of the
country’s biggest electricity distributor.  Kim, 61, will take office after his appointment is approved
by shareholders of the state-run utility at a Sept. 16 meeting
in Seoul, the company known as Kepco said in a regulatory filing
today. He will replace Kim Ssang Su, whose three-year term ended
last week.  Kepco is being run in the interim by Kim Woo Kyum,
executive vice president and chief operating officer, according
to the filing.  The utility that supplies almost all of South Korea’s
electricity posted losses in the last two quarters after it was
unable to pass on higher fuel costs to customers because the
government capped tariffs to curb inflation. Kepco has slumped
26 percent in  Seoul  trading this year, outpacing the 8.3 percent
decline in the benchmark Kospi stock index.  Kim Joong Kyum has been an adviser to Hyundai Engineering
after serving as its CEO from March 2009 and May this year.
Hyundai Engineering was part of a Kepco-led group that won a
nuclear-plant contract from the United Arab Emirates in 2009.  Kim graduated from Seoul’s Korea University in 1976 with a
bachelor’s degree in architectural engineering. He will run
Kepco for three years. The government holds a 51 percent stake
in the utility.  Kepco fell 0.2 percent to close at 22,500 won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
