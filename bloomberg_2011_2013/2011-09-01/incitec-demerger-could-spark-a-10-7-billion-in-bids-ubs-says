Incitec Pivot Ltd. (IPL)  could demerge its
fertilizer and explosives’ units and spur separate takeovers
valued at a total of A$10.7 billion ($11.5 billion),  UBS AG (UBSN)  said.  “The timing and rationale of a demerger could be right,”
UBS analysts led by Ramoun Lazar said yesterday in a report.
“The separated structure could also attract interest from both
strategic and financial buyers given the strong position of both
businesses.”  Melbourne-based Incitec’s explosives business could attract
a A$6 billion takeover from  Yara International ASA (YAR) ,  Wesfarmers
Ltd. (WES)  or private equity funds, while the fertilizer unit may be
worth A$4.7 billion to North American rivals such as  Mosaic Co. (MOS) ,
UBS said.  To contact the reporter for this story:
