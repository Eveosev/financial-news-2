The Turkish Grand Prix wasn’t
included on the Formula One calendar for the 2012 season, which
will begin in  Australia  on March 18.  The United States Grand Prix, which will return to auto-
racing’s elite series for the first time since 2007, is
scheduled Nov. 18 at the  Circuit of the Americas  track in
Austin,  Texas . The season ends the following week in  Brazil .  Next year’s 20-race calendar was confirmed following a fax
vote of the World Motor Sport Council, the Federation
