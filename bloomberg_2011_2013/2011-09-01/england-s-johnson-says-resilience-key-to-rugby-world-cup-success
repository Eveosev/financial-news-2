England  manager Martin Johnson says
resilience is more important than playing style in making
progress at the Rugby World Cup.  Johnson, who captained England to victory at the 2003
tournament, said finding a way to close out knockout-round
games at the Sept. 9 to Oct. 23 event in New Zealand will be
the crucial factor. England, which made the past two World Cup
finals, first plays  Argentina  on Sept. 10 before taking on
Georgia, Romania and Scotland.  “I don’t think there’s a certain style, I think there’s a
certain resilience that’s going to win this World Cup,” Johnson
said, according to the tournament website. “You’re going to
have to be tough, you’re going to have to deal with the pressure
and the expectation.”  Should England finish atop its five-team pool, it would
play the runner-up from Pool A in the quarterfinals. Top-ranked
 New Zealand  is the bookmakers’ favorite to win that group ahead
of fourth-ranked  France .  “World Cups are about pressure, dealing with it off the
field and obviously on the field when you get into close games
with it all to play for in the last 10 minutes,” Johnson said.  Johnson says the All Blacks’ back-to-back losses to  South
Africa  and  Australia  in the Tri-Nations last month would have no
bearing on the World Cup. New Zealand is seeking its first title
since winning the inaugural tournament in 1987.  “Once you get to the World Cup, they are all sort of
standalone games,” he said. “It doesn’t really matter what’s
happened last game, last year, last week, last month. It’s about
what you do on the day.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
