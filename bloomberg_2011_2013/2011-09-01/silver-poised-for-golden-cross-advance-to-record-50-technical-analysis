Silver is poised to form a so-called
“golden cross” which may push the metal to a record $50 an
ounce by October, according to  technical analysis  by brokerage
GoldCore Ltd.  The attached chart shows silver’s 50-day moving average may
be heading above the 100-day moving average. The golden cross,
which occurs when a short-term trend line rises above a longer-
term one, is viewed by some chart analysts as a bullish signal.  “The 50-day moving average is rising after the recent
price gain and is looking like it will cross the 100-day moving
average in the coming days, which will be a bullish technical
signal,” said Mark O’Byrne, executive director of GoldCore in
Dublin. “We should see silver surpass the record nominal high
in the coming weeks or months.”  Silver for immediate delivery touched a record $49.79 on
April 25 and traded at $41.561 by 5:49 a.m. in  London  today,
taking its gain this year to 34 percent. It’s the best-
performing main precious metal this year, beating global
equities, commodities and Treasuries.  Prices rallied about 55 percent between Sept. 10 and the
end of last year when the 50-day moving average climbed above
the 100-day moving average. A gain of that much would push the
metal to about $64, which is possible by the end of this year,
O’Byrne said.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
