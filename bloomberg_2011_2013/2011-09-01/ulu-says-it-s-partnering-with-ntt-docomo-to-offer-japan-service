Hulu LLC, the video-streaming
website owned by  News Corp. (NWSA) ,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  and  NBC Universal ,
began a subscription-based service in  Japan , its first
international expansion as it solicits takeover bids.  Subscribers in Japan will pay 1,480 yen ($19.21) a month to
stream hundreds of movies and thousands of U.S. television
shows, Hulu said in a statement today. Japanese-produced content
and Asian films and TV shows will be added to the service as
Hulu secures rights, the company said.  Disney Chief Executive Officer  Robert Iger  said in July at
the Allen & Co. conference in  Sun Valley ,  Idaho , that Hulu’s
owners are committed to selling the company. Satellite-
television providers Dish Network Corp. and DirecTV said they
have considered acquiring Hulu.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , Yahoo Inc. and  AT&T
Inc. (T)  have also expressed interest, according to people familiar
with the matter.  Hulu is partnering with  NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , Japan’s largest
mobile-phone operator, to market the online TV service in that
country. Los Angeles-based Hulu said details of the partnership
will be “unveiled shortly,” according to the statement.  Subscribers will have access to the service on any mobile
network in Japan, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
