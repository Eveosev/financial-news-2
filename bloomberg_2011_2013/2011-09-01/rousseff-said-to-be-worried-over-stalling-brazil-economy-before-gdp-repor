President  Dilma Rousseff  believes
that the economy expanded less than 0.8 percent in the second
quarter, a sign that growth in  Latin America ’s biggest economy
is stalling, a government official said.  The government expects the monthly inflation rate to be
close to zero in the final quarter of the year and is working
with an internal economic growth forecast this year of 3.8
percent, said the official, who while close to the president
isn’t authorized to discuss her views publicly.  Yesterday’s surprise decision by the central bank to cut
the benchmark  interest rate  half a percentage point to 12
percent took into account Brazil’s weakening economy, said the
official. An increase in the country’s minimum wage and lower
borrowing costs should help boost growth next year without the
need for additional fiscal stimulus, he said.  Economists expect  Brazil ’s gross domestic product expanded
0.8 percent in the second quarter from the first three months of
the year, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of 40 analysts. The national statistics agency publishes the GDP
report tomorrow at 8 a.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
