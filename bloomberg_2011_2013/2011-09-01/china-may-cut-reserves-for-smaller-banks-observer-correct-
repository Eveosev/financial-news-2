(Corrects spelling of newspaper.)  China ’s central bank may cut
required reserve ratios for small and medium-sized banks to
support lending to small companies, Economic Observer reported
today, citing unidentified analysts.  Banks are facing tighter cash after the People’s Bank of
China asked domestic lenders to include customers’ margin
deposits when calculating required reserves, according to the
Beijing-based newspaper.  Margin deposits account for more than 20 percent of total
outstanding lending from small banks, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
