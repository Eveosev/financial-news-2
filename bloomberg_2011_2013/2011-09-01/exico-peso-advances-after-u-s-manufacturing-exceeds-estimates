Mexico ’s peso rose to the strongest
level in two weeks after data showed U.S. manufacturing
unexpectedly expanded in August, signaling the two-year economic
recovery may be sustained.  The peso strengthened 0.3 percent to 12.2908 per  U.S.
dollar  at 5 p.m.  New York  time, from 12.3327 yesterday. It was
the third-best performer among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  The Institute for Supply Management reported its factory
index was 50.6 last month, exceeding economists’ projection that
the gauge would drop to 48.5, according to the median forecast
of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Figures greater than 50
signal expansion. The U.S. is Mexico’s top trading partner and
the buyer of 80 percent of its exports.  “The peso is very sensitive to indicators in the
manufacturing sector in the U.S.,”  Enrique Alvarez , head of
Latin America fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal in New York,
said in a telephone interview. “There was anxiety that the
slowdown in manufacturing in the U.S. may spill over to
Mexico.”  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.29 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.54 centavo to 133.29 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
