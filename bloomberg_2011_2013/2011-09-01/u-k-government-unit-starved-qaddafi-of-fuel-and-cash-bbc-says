The U.K. government set up a unit to
coordinate economic sanctions against  Muammar Qaddafi , ensuring
he was starved of fuel while Libyan rebels were supplied, the
 BBC reported , citing unnamed officials.  The group tracked  oil tankers  to facilitate a blockade
against Qaddafi, while encouraging Geneva-based oil trader Vitol
Group to sell to the rebels, the BBC said. The unit was the
brainchild of International Development Minister Alan Duncan, a
former Vitol employee, the BBC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
