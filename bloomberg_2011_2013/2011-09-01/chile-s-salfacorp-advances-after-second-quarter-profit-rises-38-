Salfacorp SA gained the most in
three weeks after  Chile ’s largest construction and engineering
company said second-quarter profit rose 38 percent.  Salfacorp climbed 2.6 percent to 1,511 pesos at 1:48 p.m.
New York time, the biggest intraday advance since Aug. 12. The
benchmark Ipsa index added 0.4 percent.  The company reported second-quarter profit of 3.66 billion
pesos ($7.9 million), compared with 2.66 billion pesos a year
earlier, according to a statement posted yesterday after the
close of trading on the website of Chile’s securities regulator.  “Salfacorp posted good results,” Jorge Opaso, an analyst
at Santiago-based brokerage Larrain Vial SA, wrote in a note to
clients. “The company has a positive scenario for its business
divisions as it expands operations in Peru and  Colombia .”  Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA reiterated a “buy”
recommendation for the stock after the results were disclosed.  In the second quarter, Salfacorp completed the acquisition
of peer Tecsa SA and of 80 percent of ICEM SA, another Chilean
builder. The company also raised 62 billion pesos from a new
share sale which may be used for acquisitions, according to a
separate statement posted yesterday on the regulator’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
