The euro may extend its losses to a
five-month low versus its Japanese counterpart after falling
below 109.91 yen, Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd. said,
citing trading patterns.  A close below the level, which represents the middle of a
range called a descending channel that the currencies have been
trading in since April, may weaken the 17-nation euro to the
106-yen level, according to Takuya Kawabata, a researcher in
 Tokyo  at the unit of  Japan ’s largest foreign-exchange margin
company.  “Breaching the middle point of the downward trend channel,
the euro will be headed to the 106-yen level where the
descending channel base lies,” Kawabata said. “The euro’s
bearish trend against the yen is likely to continue as long as
the currencies stay in the range.”  The euro traded at 109.66 yen as of 8:22 a.m. in Tokyo from
109.70 yen in  New York  yesterday. It has fallen 11 percent from
the April 11 high of 123.33 yen.  The European currency sank to 106.61 yen on March 17, when
Japan’s record earthquake and ensuing tsunami prompted investors
to buy the yen as a refuge.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
