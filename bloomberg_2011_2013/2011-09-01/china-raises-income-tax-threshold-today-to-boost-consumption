China  raises the threshold for the
payment of personal income tax from today, aiding consumption in
the world’s second-biggest economy as a global slowdown
threatens demand for exports.  The level of income rises to 3,500 yuan ($549) per month
from 2,000 yuan, according to a statement from the standing
committee of the National People’s Congress, dated June 30 and
posted on the website of the State Administration of Taxation.  Rising domestic demand may help China weather weakness in
the global economy after an index of export orders slid in a
manufacturing survey released today. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said
last month that policy makers can do more to boost consumption
to shield the nation from external shocks.  “In the event of another global downturn, the government
may support households through more aggressive pro-consumption
measures,”  Jing Ulrich , JPMorgan’s chairman of global markets,
China, said last month.  --Zheng Lifei. Editors: Paul Panckhurst, Ken McCalllum.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
