Swedish manufacturing contracted for
the first time since May 2009 as orders and production declined
in the largest Nordic economy.  An index based on responses from about 200 purchasing
managers fell to a seasonally adjusted 48.7 in August from 50.1
in the prior month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which compiles
the index, said today. Analysts had expected 49.8, according to
a Bloomberg survey. A reading above 50 signals expansion.  “It’s obvious that the industrial sector is hit by the
slowdown in the global economy, which seems to have accelerated
in August,” said Bengt Rostroem, an analyst at Nordea Bank AB,
in a note. “This would give the Riksbank another reason to stay
on hold at the meeting 6 September.”  Growth in the Swedish economy is slowing as European
leaders struggle to contain a sovereign debt crisis and after
 Standard & Poor’s  downgrade of the U.S. deepened a plunge in
global stock markets this month. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg expect the Riksbank to abandon a plan from July to
raise  interest rates  twice more this year.  Weak manufacturing data “must affect” the Riksbank’s rate
decision, due to be announced on Sept. 7, said Jan Haggstrom,
chief economist at Svenska Handelsbanken AB in  Stockholm . He
expects the bank to leave its main rate at 2 percent.  The krona was little changed against the euro at 9.1158 at
12:58 p.m. in Stockholm. The Swedish currency lost 0.6 percent
against the dollar to 6.3833.  The PMI’s sub-index for orders rose to 47.0 from 45.4 and
the index for production fell to 48.6 from 49.4, still
indicating contractions.  The central bank in July raised its benchmark lending rate
for a seventh time in a year to cool inflation. Sweden’s economy
expanded 5.7 percent last year, the most in the European Union,
as exports recovered from the financial crisis and consumers
kept up spending.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
