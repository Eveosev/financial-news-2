Australia’s dollar rose for a third
week versus its U.S. counterpart in its longest winning streak
since June as investors pared bets the  Reserve Bank  will cut
borrowing costs.  The Aussie traded at almost a one-month high as traders
signaled an 80 percent chance that RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens 
will hold the developed world’s highest target lending rate
unchanged Sept. 6. New Zealand’s dollar rose for a second week
versus the greenback as the world’s largest dairy exporter said
it expects to maintain its forecast payout to farmers. Gains in
both currencies were tempered after data showed U.S. job growth
stagnated last month.  “Markets are just pricing out, to a reasonable degree, an
imminent risk of a rate cut, at least for the month of
September,” said Darryl Conroy, a financial markets analyst at
Suncorp Bank in Brisbane,  Australia .  Australia’s dollar fell 0.5 percent to $1.0665 at 12:38
p.m. in  New York , paring its weekly advance to 0.9 percent.
Yesterday it touched $1.0765, the strongest since Aug. 4. The
currency traded 0.7 percent weaker at 81.91 yen, from 82.48
yesterday, for a weekly gain of 1.1 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, slipped 0.2
percent to 84.90 U.S. cents, from 85.08 cents, trimming its
weekly gain to 1 percent. It fell 0.4 percent to 65.21 yen, from
65.46, paring a five-day increase to 1.2 percent.  Cash-rate futures show traders reduced to 20 percent the
chance of an RBA rate cut this month, from 32 percent Aug. 26.  Rate Bets  Credit Suisse Group AG indexes based on swaps trading show
the RBA will reduce its 4.75 percent key rate by 113 basis
points, or 1.13 percentage points, over a year, and the Reserve
Bank of  New Zealand  will increase its 2.5 percent benchmark by
48 basis points.  Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the world’s
biggest dairy exporter, said it expects to pay its 10,500 farmer
shareholders NZ$6.75 ($5.75) per kilogram of milk solids in the
year ending May 31, 2012. That matches its forecast in May this
year, the company’s highest opening estimate.  Fonterra processes 95 percent of New Zealand’s milk and
generates more than 20 percent of the nation’s annual export
earnings, according to its website.  The Aussie and kiwi erased gains today as demand for
higher-yielding assets fell after a government report showed
U.S. payrolls were unchanged last month, the weakest reading in
almost a year. They added 85,000 jobs in July, fewer than
initially estimated. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey called for a rise of 68,000 last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
