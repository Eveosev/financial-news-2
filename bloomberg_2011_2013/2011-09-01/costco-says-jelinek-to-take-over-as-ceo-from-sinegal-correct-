(Corrects time element in third paragraph.)  Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) , the largest
U.S. warehouse-club chain, appointed Chief Operating Officer
Craig Jelinek to succeed Chief Executive Officer Jim Sinegal,
who is stepping down Jan. 1.  Jelinek, a 28-year veteran of the company, started as a
warehouse manager, Issaquah, Washington-based Costco said. He
also holds the title of president.  Sinegal, a co-founder of Costco, took helm of the company
in August 1988, according to Bloomberg data. He plans to
continue on Costco’s board and will seek re-election in January.
He will serve in an advisory role through January 2013.  Costco today also reported fourth-quarter revenue of $27.6
billion, which met the average estimate from analysts polled by
Bloomberg. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, in August rose 6
percent, the company said. That’s more than a 4.9 percent
increase estimated by Retail Metrics.  Jeff Elliott, a spokesman for Costco, didn’t immediately
return a message left on his office phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
