OAO Gazprom, Russia’s gas export
monopoly, plans to sign contracts with Belarus and agree on
buying the 50 percent of the national pipeline operator it
doesn’t already own in early December.  The terms of the new gas supply and transit contracts will
be linked to the Beltransgaz acquisition, the Moscow-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. The current gas
agreements expire at the end of this year.  Russia has linked the disbursement of bailout loans to
Belarus’s selling $7.5 billion of assets in the next three
years. Belarus may need to raise $12 billion by 2013 through
asset sales and international loans to stave off economic
collapse, Moody’s Investors Service said Aug. 23.  Russia plans to introduce a discount for natural gas
supplies to Belarus starting from Jan. 1, contingent on Gazprom
gaining control of Belarus’s gas pipeline company, Russian Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  said on Aug. 15.  Gazprom and Belarus signed their previous supply contract 2
minutes before midnight on Dec. 31, 2006, after a pricing
dispute threatened to disrupt supplies. President  Dmitry
Medvedev   asked  Gazprom Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  on
Aug. 15 to avoid a repeat of the situation.  State-controlled Gazprom already owns half of Beltransgaz,
paying $2.5 billion to build up its stake from 2007 to 2010.  The Russian-led Eurasian Economic Community has sent $800
million of a pledged $3 billion loan to Belarus and plans to
disburse the remainder in five further installments over the
next three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
