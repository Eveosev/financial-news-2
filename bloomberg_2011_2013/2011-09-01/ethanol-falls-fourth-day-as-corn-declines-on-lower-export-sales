Ethanol futures fell for a fourth
day in  Chicago  as corn declined, which may mean lower production
costs for the biofuel.  Futures extended the longest streak of losses since the
week ended June 27 after the U.S. Agriculture Department said
exporters sold 957,934 metric tons of corn last week, down 43
percent from a year ago. In U.S. ethanol production, one bushel
of the grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel.  “Today’s price decline was tied to corn, no doubt,” said
Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at the Linn Group in Chicago. “You’re
at record highs going into a three-day weekend.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 7 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $2.843 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Aug. 19 and the steepest decline since
Aug. 8. Futures are up 20 percent this year.  The Labor Day holiday this weekend marks the end of the
peak gasoline demand season in the U.S.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  slumped 7.5
cents, or 2.5 percent, to $2.965 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the biofuel decreased 5 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.975,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago lost 4.25 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
$2.8875 a gallon and in on the West Coast the additive dropped 3
cents, or 1 percent, to $3.015.  Corn for December delivery plummeted 29 cents, or 3.8
percent, to $7.385 a bushel in Chicago.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, was 19 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
