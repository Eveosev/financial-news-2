Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  has “everything
under control,” with regards to the sale of  T-Mobile USA  to
AT&T Inc., board memberNiek Jan van Damme told reporters on the
sidelines of the IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin today.
Van Damme said the company doesn’t depend on the cash from the
deal to pursue its investment plans in other markets, adding
that “of course extra funds would be good.”  Since the deal was struck, Deutsche Telekom did not pursue
other options for T-Mobile USA, van Damme said.  “We’ve been focused on this deal,” he said, adding that
it “is not over.”  The board and supervisory board were gathered for a regular
meeting yesterday when they were handed the news at about 4.30
p.m. in Bonn that the U.S. Justice Department sued to block the
transaction, he said.  Deutsche Telekom rose 9.4 cents, or 1.1 percent, to 8.90
euros at 11:29 a.m. in Frankfurt trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
