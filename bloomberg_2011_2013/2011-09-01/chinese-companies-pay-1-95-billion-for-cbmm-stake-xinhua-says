CITIC Group, Baosteel Group Corp.
and Taiyuan Iron and Steel (Group) Co. jointly acquired a 15
percent stake in Brazilian niobium producer CBMM for $1.95
billion, Xinhua News reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The Chinese companies set up a joint venture, China Niobium
Investment Holding Co., to acquire the CBMM stake, according to
the report. Calls to Taiyuan Steel’s office in Shanxi province
and CITIC Group’s in Beijing weren’t answered.  The report follows the purchase of a similar-sized stake in
the closely held company whose full name is Companhia Brasileira
de Metalurgia e Mineracao by a group of Japanese and Korean
companies in March. The companies that bought that stake include
Posco, South Korea’s National Pension Service,  Nippon Steel
Corp. (5401) , JFE Holdings Inc.,  Sojitz Corp. (2768)  and Japan Oil, Gas and
Metals National Corp.  Rising prices of rare metals from niobium, which can be
used to strengthen steel, and indium, used in liquid-crystal
displays, to lithium, chrome and magnesium, have increased
competition for supplies.  The Brazilian producer, established in 1955, mines and
produces niobium, a key material used to make steel for cars,
buildings and oil pipelines, and has about 82 percent of the
global market, Posco said in the March statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
