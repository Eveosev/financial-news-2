Peru ’s benchmark dollar bond yields
fell to a 10-month low after  Standard & Poor’s  raised the
country’s foreign debt rating, spurring demand for the nation’s
financial assets.  The yield on the nation’s 6.55 percent dollar-denominated
bond due March 2037 fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 4.99 percent at 5:30 p.m. New York time. That’s the
bond’s lowest yield since Nov. 4. The security’s price rose 0.22
cent to 122.36 cents per dollar.  S&P on Aug. 30 raised Peru to BBB, the second-lowest
investment grade, from BBB- and gave the rating a stable
outlook, pointing to signs President Ollanta Humala will
continue policies that made the country the region’s fastest-
growing economy. The decision will likely spur demand for Peru’s
assets and lower borrowing costs, Alejandro Perez-Reyes, head of
investments at Prima AFP, the nation’s biggest pension fund
manager.  “The current fiscal situation of the country is very
strong and the policies announced by the government so far
shouldn’t change that,” Perez-Reyes said. “If things were to
change in the future then the rating can be revised upwards or
downwards, but at this time I think the upgrade is a fair
reflection of the strength of the Peruvian economy and the
ability of the government to honor its debts.”  The sol held near a three-year high of 2.7275 per  U.S.
dollar , little changed from 2.7265 yesterday.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose one basis point to 5.56
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
