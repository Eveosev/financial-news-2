Aluminum buyers in  Japan ,  Asia ’s
largest importer, won a cut in fees charged by a major producer,
the first drop in three quarters, after the nation’s recovery
from the March earthquake and tsunami lost momentum.  The premium for the three months ending Dec. 31 was set at
$118 a metric ton over the London Metal Exchange cash price in
transactions agreed so far, compared with $120 this quarter,
said three executives involved in the negotiations. They
declined to be identified because the talks were private.  The fee declined as the U.S. economic slowdown and the
yen’s rally to a postwar record against the dollar threaten
Japan’s export-led recovery. Aluminum supply is also abundant as
smelters in the  Middle East  boosted shipments to Asian buyers,
intensifying competition with Australian and American producers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
