The Office of Communications, the
U.K.’s media regulator, is to set out plans for the first
superfast wireless communication in Britain to use so-called
“white space” gaps, which are airwaves usually reserved for
television, the Financial Times reported, citing Ed Richards,
Ofcom’s chief executive.  “We are hoping that white space develops in the same way
as WiFi has in the U.K,” the newspaper cited Richards as
saying.  For Related News and Information:
