South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
index stayed below 50 for the second consecutive month in
August, signaling a continued contraction in manufacturing,
Kagiso Tiso Holdings said.  The seasonally adjusted index gained for the first month in
five, advancing to 46.7 from a two-year low of 44.2 in July,
Johannesburg-based  Kagiso  said in an e-mailed statement today.  “From a gross domestic product growth perspective, the
most concerning part of the latest PMI numbers is the sharp
deterioration in near-term demand, as well as the downbeat
expectations for future business conditions,” Kagiso’s Head of
Research Abdul Davids said.  Africa’s largest economy grew at its slowest pace in almost
two years in the second quarter as output of manufacturing,
which makes up about 15 percent of the economy, and mining
dropped. Growth slowed to an annualized 1.3 percent from 4.5
percent in the three months through March, Statistics South
Africa said on Aug. 30.  While the business-activity index gained 10.7 points to
46.6, it remains “significantly below the strong reading of
55.2 recorded in June,” Kagiso said. The employment index at
43.1 indicated a “weak factory-sector job market,” it said.  South Africa’s jobless rate, the highest of 61 countries
tracked by Bloomberg, increased to 25.7 percent in the second
quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
