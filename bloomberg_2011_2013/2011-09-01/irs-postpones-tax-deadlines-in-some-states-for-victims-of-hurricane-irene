The  Internal Revenue Service 
postponed some filing deadlines for taxpayers affected by
Hurricane Irene, the agency announced today.  Some tax forms due on Sept. 15 and Oct. 17 will now be due
Oct. 31. The decision affects individuals and businesses in
certain parts of  North Carolina ,  New Jersey ,  New York  and  Puerto
Rico .  In New Jersey, for example, the change applies only in
Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic and Somerset counties.  Other areas may be added following federal disaster
assessments, the IRS said.  The announcement applies to several tax deadlines.
Corporations and businesses that applied for extensions on their
2010 returns typically would face a Sept. 15 deadline. The
similar extension for individuals would have expired Oct. 17.  The new Oct. 31 deadline also applies to estimated tax
payments for the third quarter of 2011.  On Aug. 26, the IRS announced that it would delay the
previously announced Aug. 31 deadline for all taxpayers to
submit requests to join the agencyâ€™s offshore voluntary
disclosure program because of the storm. The new deadline for
those requests is Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
