Ukraine is not planning a merger of
its state energy company NAK Naftogaz Ukrainy with  Russia â€™s OAO
Gazprom, Ukrainian government newspaper  Uryadovyi Kurier 
reported, citing Coal and Energy Minister Yuriy Boyko.  The government is not planning to follow the example of
Belarus and sell its natural gas pipelines to Russia, Kurier
cited Boyko as saying. Talks with Russia on terms of natural gas
imports and transit are going to switch from a working status to
official status, Boyko said as cited by Kurier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
