Eagle Bulk Shipping Inc. (EGLE) , the
world’s third-largest owner of supramax dry-bulk ships, said
Keith Denholm, head of its Singapore-based freight-trading unit,
resigned, according to Alan Ginsberg, chief financial officer.  Ginsberg declined to comment on the reason for the
departure or his replacement.  “His departure has no impact on our commitment to building
the trading business,” Ginsberg said by phone from  New York .  Eagle Bulk started its freight trading business in
Singapore a year ago, the company said in a Sept. 13  statement 
on its website. The company planned to trade dry freight using
ships hired under single voyage charters and longer-term hires,
the company said.  Eagle Bulk is the third-largest owner of handymax and
supramax-sized vessels, each of 40,000 to 60,000 deadweight
tons, according to German transportation lender, DVB Bank SE.
 China  Ocean Shipping (Group) Co., China’s largest shipowner, and
China Shipping Group Co. are the largest and second-largest
supramax owners, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
