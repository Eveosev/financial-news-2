Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-
largest mining company, said it is making progress on its Benga
and Zambeze coal projects in  Mozambique .  “Progress is being made on Benga, Zambeze and Tete East,
with construction on the Benga project well under way,”  David
Joyce , managing director in charge of project expansion at the
company’s iron ore unit, said at a presentation in Perth today.
“We are working closely with the government to address
infrastructure and national development priorities, which in
turn will allow for timely completion and export of product.”  Rio joins Vale SA in expanding in Mozambique as coal prices
climb. The London-based company may add 25 million metric tons
of Mozambique coal to its annual output after completing its
A$3.4 billion ($3.6 billion) acquisition of Riversdale Mining
Ltd., which owns the mines, earlier this year.  Benga will ship about 5 million tons of unprocessed coal
this year and may expand deliveries to 20 million tons,
Riversdale Managing Director Steve Mallyon said on June 20. The
adjacent Zambeze project may produce 42 million tons a year,
rising to as much as 90 million tons of unprocessed coal, he
said.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
