Germany ’s government budget deficit
narrowed to 0.6 of gross domestic product in the first half of
2011, the lowest since the first six months of 2008, the Federal
Statistics Office  said  today on its website.  Tax revenue grew 8.5 percent compared with 2010 while
expenditure grew just 0.3 percent, the statistics office said.
The deficit in the second half of 2010 reached 5.4 percent,
caused mainly by allocations to the rescued Hypo Real Estate
Group, it added.  Germany’s compound deficit in 2010  reached  3.3 percent,
over the limit of 3 percent set in the single currency’s rules.
The deficit is a compound of over-spending that’s plugged by net
new debt in federal, state, municipal and social security
budgets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
