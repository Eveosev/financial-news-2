Solar-grade polysilicon and finished
photovoltaic panels accelerated their declines in the past week,
according to EnergyTrend.com, raising concerns among investors
about the recovery in demand for the products.  The price of polysilicon, the main raw material in solar
generators, fell by 1.1 percent the past seven days to an
average $50.52 per kilogram ($22.92 per pound) compared with a
0.8 percent decline last week, EnergyTrend said today in a
report on its website. Solar panel prices fell 2.4 percent to
$1.19 per watt compared with a 0.9 percent decline last week.  Investors are looking for the price of photovoltaic
equipment to stabilize to bolster hopes for a recovery of demand
in  Germany  where new installations slumped the first five months
of the year. Polysilicon fell 35 percent from March to July as
production increased faster than demand, according to a separate
 price index  by Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Demand is starting to rise “but it’s not strong yet,”
said Charles Yonts, a solar analyst at CLSA in  Hong Kong . “Two
weeks from now if it’s still not clear, we’re in trouble.”  Renewable Energy Corp ASA (REC) , the Sandvika, Norway-based
polysilicon-maker, fell as much as 2.7 percent after this week’s
pricing data was published and traded down 0.8 percent at 9.90
kroner at 12:37 p.m. today in Oslo.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the
second-biggest polysilicon producer, fell as much as 1.4 percent
after the news and traded down 3 percent at 98.36 euros.  Solarworld AG (SWV) , the German panel maker struggling to compete
with lower-cost Chinese rivals, fell as much as 2.6 percent and
was 1.8 percent lower at 5.76 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
