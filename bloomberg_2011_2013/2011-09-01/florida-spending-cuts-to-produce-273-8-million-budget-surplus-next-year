Florida isn’t facing a projected
deficit next fiscal year for the first time since at least 2007
because of permanent spending cuts that balanced this year’s
budget, a draft  study  said.  The Republican-controlled Legislature closed a $3.8 billion
gap in the current $69.1 billion budget with cuts including a
3.6 percent reduction in payrolls, a $542-per-student trim to
education funding and a requirement that workers contribute 3
percent of salaries to their pensions.  Those moves will produce a $273.8 million surplus in fiscal
2013, said the report, released today by the Legislature’s
research office. It also foresees no budget gaps in fiscal 2014
or 2015.  Future spending was “constrained by the amount of
recurring expenditure-reductions taken,” said the draft three-
year projection. “This has greatly improved the long-range
financial outlook’s bottom line.”  This is the first time the state has predicted no budget
gaps since a constitutional amendment was adopted in 2006 that
required fiscal projections for three-year periods, the report
said. A reduction in projected revenue, which is a “strong
risk” because of the slowing economy, would cause a budget gap
to develop, the report said.  Standard & Poor’s  had assigned a negative outlook to the
state’s credit rating in January 2009 because lawmakers used
one-time revenue to balance the budget. S&P revised the outlook
to stable on July 12, after the legislative session that imposed
the latest spending cuts, citing “significant progress in re-
establishing structural balance.” Florida carries S&P’s highest
rating of AAA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
