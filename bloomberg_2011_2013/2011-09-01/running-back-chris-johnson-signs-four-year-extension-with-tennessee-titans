The  Tennessee Titans  and  Chris Johnson  agreed today on a four-year contract extension, ending
the  Pro Bowl  running back’s 34-day holdout.  Johnson, 25, is now under contract through the 2016
National Football League season, team spokesman Robbie Bohren
said in an e-mail. A Pro Bowl selection in each of the last
three seasons, Johnson didn’t report to training camp or play in
the team’s preseason games while negotiating the deal.  Bohren declined to provide the terms of the deal. ESPN,
citing an unidentified league official, reported today that the
contract was worth $53 million, with $30 million guaranteed.  Johnson rushed for a league-high 2,006 yards in 2009, the
sixth player to pass the 2,000-yard mark in a season. His 2,509
yards from scrimmage that year was an NFL record. Last year he
rushed for 1,364 yards and 11 touchdowns as the Titans went 6-10
and tied for third in the American Football Conference South
division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
