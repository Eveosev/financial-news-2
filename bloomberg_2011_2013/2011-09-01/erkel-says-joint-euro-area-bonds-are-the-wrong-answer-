German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
reiterated her opposition to joint euro-area bonds, saying that
they are “the wrong answer.”  “We have differences in competitiveness” that joint debt
issuance can’t cure, Merkel told reporters in Berlin today after
talks with Portuguese Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho .  “Then you don’t have any incentive anymore to improve
competitiveness,” she said. “To believe that you can get rid
of debt by throwing all of it in one pot is the wrong
approach.” It’s an “artificial” solution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
