Discovery Holdings Ltd. (DSY) , which owns
 South Africa ’s largest medical-insurance administrator, said
fiscal full-year profit rose 50 percent after it expanded in the
U.K.  Net income for the 12 months to June 30 climbed to 2.58
billion rand ($368 million) from 1.72 billion rand a year
earlier the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement
today. Earnings a share excluding one-time items were 3.66 rand.
The median of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated
adjusted earnings a share of 3.71 rand.  In the fiscal year Discovery, which is seeking to expand
its business in South Africa and the U.K., bought the entire
share capital of Standard Life Healthcare for 1.56 billion rand
and increased its shareholding in Prudential Health Holdings
Ltd. The Prudential transaction boosted Discovery’s profit. The
insurer also raised 800 million rand in August to help it invest
in its existing business and expand further.  Discovery is “well capitalized for continued growth and
profitability into the future,” the company said, declaring a
final dividend of 48 cents a share, keeping its dividend cover
ratio at 4.5 times.  Discovery is the second-worst performing stock on the five-
member FTSE/JSE Life Assurance Index this year after  Sanlam
Ltd. (SLM) , having dropped 2.8 percent compared with the average
return of 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
