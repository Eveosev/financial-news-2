Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s Terry Laughlin, who assumed the role of chief risk officer two weeks
ago, appointed Jim Alessandri and David Flannery to newly
created positions.  Alessandri will be the retail risk-management executive,
overseeing home loans, consumer and small-business banking and
global wealth and investment management, according to an Aug. 30
memo confirmed by Eloise Hale, a company spokeswoman. Flannery
will be global banking and markets risk-management executive,
covering corporate and institutional clients.  “We are announcing changes that will accelerate our work
by allowing us to manage risk with a more holistic view of
customer relationships,” Laughlin said in the memo. “Our risk
leadership team will be streamlined and we will tightly align
senior risk-management leaders to the company’s business
lines.”  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan , 51, is
reshuffling executives amid the rising cost of faulty mortgages
acquired in the 2008 takeover of Countrywide Financial Corp.
Bank of America, based in Charlotte,  North Carolina , has
declined 40 percent this year, lagging the 26 percent decline in
the KBW Bank Index. Laughlin assumed his new role last month.  Alessandri and Flannery, who was head of global leveraged
finance, will report to Laughlin, as will Mick Ankrom, who
continues in risk for global wealth and investment management,
and Paul Morrison, who will be the risk executive for the legacy
asset servicing business, according to the memo. Craig Rosato
will leave the firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
