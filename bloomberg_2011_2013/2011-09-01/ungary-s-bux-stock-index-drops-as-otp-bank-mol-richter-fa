Hungary’s stock index fell, paring
this week’s advance as OTP Bank Nyrt., oil refiner Mol Nyrt. and
drugmaker Gedeon  Richter Nyrt . slid more than 1.7 percent.  The BUX gauge of 13 companies lost 1.8 percent to 18,144.38
as of 10 a.m. in Budapest. The benchmark was still up 1.7
percent from the end of last week.  Most European shares fell before a U.S. report that may
show manufacturing in the world’s largest economy contracted for
the first time in two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
