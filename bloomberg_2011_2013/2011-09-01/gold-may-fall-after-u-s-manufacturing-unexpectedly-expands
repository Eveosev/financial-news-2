Gold jumped the most in almost four
weeks after a report showed that U.S. employment unexpectedly
stagnated in August, lifting demand for haven assets.  The  unemployment rate  remained at 9.1 percent and payrolls
were unchanged, the weakest reading since September 2010, Labor
Department data showed. Analysts expected a gain of 65,000. Gold
has more than doubled since the end of 2008, touching a record
$1,917.90 an ounce last month, as governments worldwide
struggled with debt crises and as record-low U.S. borrowing
costs boosted bullion’s appeal as an inflation hedge.  “Today is one of a series of data points that, when taken
in aggregate, continue to show a weakening U.S. economy and a
lack of confidence in our government’s ability to do something
about it,” Steve Shafer, who helps manage $300 million as chief
investment officer of Covenant Investors, said by telephone from
Oklahoma City. “Combined with the problems out of  Europe ,
there’s a depreciating confidence in fiat currencies. All of
those funnel into a heightened demand for gold.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $47.80, or 2.6
percent, to close at $1,876.90 at 2:31 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the biggest increase since Aug. 8.  The  Federal Reserve  has taken the unprecedented step of
saying it will keep borrowing costs at almost zero percent at
least through mid-2013 to support the economy. Switzerland
unexpectedly cut  interest rates  yesterday. The  Bank of England 
and the  European Central Bank  left rates unchanged today.  ‘Significantly Higher’  “We had an end to the last gold cycle by jacking up
interest rates, and that’s clearly off the table for the next
couple of years,” Rick de los Reyes, who manages $800 million
at T. Rowe Price Group Inc.’s Global Metals and Mining Fund in
Baltimore, said today in a telephone interview. “We are going
to be in a negative real-interest-rate environment. The price
can go significantly higher.”  Gold has jumped 32 percent this year, heading for an 11th
straight annual gain. The  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index of equities has slid
8.4 percent in 2011, and Treasuries were up 5.4 percent as of
yesterday, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  “We’ve got a non-impressive jobs number, to say the
least,” Matt Zeman, a strategist at Kingsview Financial in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “You’re going to see
the risk-off trade today. Investors are feeling shaky about
going into equities. Gold and Treasuries are going to be
beneficiaries.”  Silver futures for December delivery added $1.537, or 3.7
percent, to $43.069 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery climbed $31.90, or 1.7 percent, to $1,884.80 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery declined $7.20,
or 0.9 percent, to $783.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
