The international community must
remain united in its support for  Libya  and avoid patronizing the
country’s new leadership, Italian Foreign Minister  Franco Frattini  wrote in the Wall Street Journal.  The international community must “maintain its internal
cohesion and unity of purpose in assisting Libya’s recovery and
democratic transition,” Frattini wrote in an editorial
published today.  The international community must also avoid adopting a
“patronizing attitude” toward Libya and should establish a
“long-term partnership” with the country, Frattini wrote in
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
