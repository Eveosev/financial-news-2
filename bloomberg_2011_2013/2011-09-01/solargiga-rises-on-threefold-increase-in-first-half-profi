Solargiga Energy Holdings Ltd. (757) , a
Chinese maker of solar wafers and ingots, rose the most in 13
months in Hong Kong trading after saying first-half profit
almost tripled.  The shares jumped 16.5 percent, the biggest increase since
July 21, 2010, to HK$1.27 and were trading at HK$1.25 as of
10:48 a.m. local time. That compares with a 2 percent gain in
the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Solargigaâ€™s net income almost tripled to 112.8 million yuan
($17.7 million) for the six months ended June 30 from 41.2
million yuan a year earlier, according to a filing to the Hong
Kong stock exchange yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
