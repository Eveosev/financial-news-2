The grain backlog at the southern
port of Novorossiysk,  Russia ’s main export hub, is unlikely to
benefit trade from the U.S., said Peter Biermann, general
manager of export operations at Aston FFI, a trading unit of
Russian grain and oilseed producer OAO Aston. He commented in an
e-mail today.  OAO Russian Railways, the country’s railroad monopoly,
banned further grain loading for Novorossiysk port from Aug. 27
after a backlog of more than 3,600 grain cars developed in the
area. Russia exported 4.8 million metric tons of grain and
products in the July 1 to Aug. 22 period, according to the
national food safety watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor.  “I don’t think that the U.S. will benefit from the rail-
car backlog we face in Novorossiysk. There is still the price
attractiveness of Russian wheat and the export surplus.
‘‘What could happen is that the exports will take a longer time
and might therefore last until the end of the campaign -- June
2012.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
