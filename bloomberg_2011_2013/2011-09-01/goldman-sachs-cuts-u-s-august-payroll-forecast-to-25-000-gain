Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said the slow pace of hiring recently in the U.S. led them
to cut their August payroll forecast to a 25,000 gain.  The new estimate is down from a prior projection of a
50,000 increase, the economists said. Their forecast for the
 unemployment rate  was unchanged at 9.1 percent.  “The main reason is the accumulation of evidence of weak
hiring in late July and August,” the economists, led by Jan Hatzius, wrote in a note to clients today. “The recent pickup
in layoff announcements is a concern.”  Among the reports citing weak employment figures are the
Conference Board’s consumer confidence survey and its separate
gauge of online help-wanted advertising for August, yesterday’s
ADP Employer Services report that measures private payroll data
and today’s employment component in the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s factory index, the New York-based economists wrote.  The cut in the payrolls forecast contrasts with Moody’s
Analytics Inc. economists, who raised their estimate today to an
increase of 50,000 from a previous projection of a 30,000 gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
