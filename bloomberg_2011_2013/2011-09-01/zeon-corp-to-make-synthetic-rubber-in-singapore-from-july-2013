Zeon Corp. (4205)  plans to begin production
at its synthetic rubber plant in Singapore from July 2013.  The Tokyo-based manufacturer is building a solution-
polymerized styrene-butadiene rubber plant at Jurong Island in
Singapore that will begin producing 30,000 to 40,000 tons a year
of the synthetic rubber in July 2013, the company said in an e-
mailed press release. Another 30,000 to 40,000 tons a year of
capacity will start operating in the first half of 2016.  Zeon aims to triple its annual sales of the product to $422
million by 2020, according to Naozumi Furukawa, the companyâ€™s
president and chief executive officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
