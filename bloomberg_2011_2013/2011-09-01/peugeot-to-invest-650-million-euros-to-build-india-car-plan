PSA Peugeot Citroen,  Europe ’s
second-biggest carmaker, will invest 650 million euros ($929
million) to build a plant in  India  with capacity to produce
170,000 vehicles a year.  Peugeot will assemble two cars, a new compact sedan and its
existing 508 mid-size model, at the plant in the state of
Gujarat starting in 2014, spokesman Pierre-Olivier Salmon said
by phone.  “The compact car category corresponds closely to the needs
of India’s emerging middle class,” Salmon said. He declined to
elaborate on what role the Indian government may have in a
“state support agreement” announced today in a statement on
the plant project.  Chief Executive Officer Philippe Varin is looking to add
factories in India and  China  in an effort to reduce the
automaker’s dependence on the slower-growing European market.
Peugeot said in July it was considering sites in the states of
Gujarat,  Tamil Nadu  and  Andhra Pradesh , after the CEO said in
December that investment plans for India had entered an “active
phase.”  The plant investment deal includes options for future
expansion, Paris-based Peugeot said in today’s statement. The
carmaker will start importing the 508 to India before the new
facility comes on stream, Salmon said, without giving a more
precise date.  The announcement comes 18 months after Peugeot suspended a
project to build a plant near Hyderabad, India, pending the
outcome of tie-up talks with Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
Negotiations between the French and Japanese carmakers ended
without a deal last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
