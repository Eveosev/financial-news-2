Ukrainian weather conditions are
unfavorable for planting of winter rapeseed, the national
weather center said.  “Soil humidity is not sufficient for sowing of winter
rapeseed in the south and in the center of  Ukraine ,” Tetiana Adamenko, head of the agricultural department at the
Hydrometeorology Center, said by phone today from Kiev.  Seeding of winter rapeseed in the country’s south should be
completed before Sept. 10, otherwise producers are at risk of
crop losses, Adamenko said.  Farmers sowed the oilseed on 465,000 hectares (1.1 million
acres), or almost half of the planned area, as of Aug. 28,
according to Agriculture Ministry data. The ministry is
targeting planting on 950,000 hectares this year for the 2012
harvest, about equal to the prior year’s area.  To contact the reporter on this story:
