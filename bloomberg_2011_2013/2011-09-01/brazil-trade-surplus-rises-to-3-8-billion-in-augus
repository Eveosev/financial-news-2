Brazil ’s trade surplus widened to
$3.9 billion last month from $3.1 billion in July, the  Trade
Ministry  said today on its website. The August figure was higher
than the median forecast of $3.4 billion in a Bloomberg survey
of 22 analysts.  Higher commodity prices this year offset gains in the
currency, helping increase the 12-month  trade balance  to $28.5
billion, from $17 billion a year ago.  The real gained 9.1 percent in the past year, the best
performer among the seven most-traded Latin American currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. At 11:59 a.m. New York time, the real
traded at 1.6017 per  U.S. dollar , a 0.8 percent fall from Aug.
31.  Brazil’s exports rose to $26.2 billion from $19.2 billion a
year ago, while imports increased to $22.3 billion from $16.8
billion, the Trade Ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
