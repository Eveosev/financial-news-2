U.S. taxpayers received $12.7
billion in proceeds from the government’s wind-down of its
mortgage-backed securities last month, the Treasury Department
said.  Through the end of August, taxpayers received a total of
$172.1 billion through sales by the Treasury and principal and
interest payments,  Matthew Rutherford , the department’s deputy
assistant secretary for federal finance, said in a statement
today. The Treasury’s original investment in agency-guaranteed
mortgage-backed securities was $225 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
