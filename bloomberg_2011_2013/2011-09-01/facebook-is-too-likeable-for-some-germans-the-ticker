The data-protection commissioner for the state of Schleswig-Holstein, Thilo
Weichert, has called for all state offices to remove Facebook's "like" button
from their web pages and close their Facebook fan pages. Website operators who
defy the ban risk a 50,000 euro ($71,000) fine. Weichert worries that the  Palo
Alto , California-based company will use the button, which allows members to
share content with friends, to gather user information and create personalized
profiles, which Weichert says violates German and European Union law. Other
German states, including Lower Saxony and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, have
followed Schleswig-Holstein's lead. German resistance to American corporations is nothing new. Last year, Google
Inc. ran into a storm of opposition from German government officials over the
search engine's "Street View" technology, which allows close-up shots of city
streets. In a population with deep-seated memories of Nazi surveillance and
persecution, privacy concerns resonate. The latest jousting with a U.S. company
is also consistent with German suspicions of all things foreign. It may even
prompt cynics to suspect that the government aims to ban anything that people
"like" -- lest the earnest German suddenly enjoys himself. Even pleasure is
regulated in  Germany . Just like Oktoberfest, fun is a highly organized event
requiring supervision. Facebook should be careful not to fall into that
category. (David Henry is an editor at Bloomberg View.)
