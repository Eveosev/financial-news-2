Discounts on gasoil cargoes in  Asia 
fell against spot benchmarks. Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought two
gasoline cargoes in  Singapore .  Middle Distillates  Glencore International AG bought two cargoes, each
containing 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring the
Platts window today. The European trader agreed to pay a
discount of 35 cents a barrel below benchmark prices to
Brightoil Petroleum Holdings and purchased the other cargo from
Singapore Petroleum Co. at a discount of 30 cents.  That compares with a discount of as much as 40 cents below
benchmark quotes paid for similar-sized cargoes yesterday.  Vitol Group sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10-parts-
per-million of sulfur, a higher-quality  diesel fuel , to Shell at
a premium of $2.60 a barrel over prices of gasoil with 0.5
percent sulfur.  Mitsui & Co. sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10-parts-
per-million of sulfur to BP Plc at a premium of $2.50 a barrel
over prices of gasoil with 0.5 percent sulfur.  Gasoil’s crack spread over Dubai crude rose 64 cents to
$18.32 a barrel at 6:19 p.m. Singapore time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  Light Distillates  Shell bought 50,000 barrels of 97-RON gasoline from Vitol
at $133.10 a barrel and 50,000 barrels of 95-RON from Total SA
at $130.70 a barrel, the survey showed.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures, a
measure of profitability for refiners, rose to $118.20 a ton at
6:10 p.m. Singapore time from $102.30 a ton at the end of
trading in Asia yesterday, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fuel Oil   Shell bought 20,000 tons of 380-centistoke fuel oil at $665
a ton from Hin Leong Trading Pte, the survey showed. Vitol sold
a similar cargo to PetroChina Co. at a premium of $4 a ton to
380-centistoke fuel oil prices published by Platts.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened $1.27, or 22
percent, to $6.98 a barrel at 2:18 p.m. Singapore time, PVM
said. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
was at $10.75 a ton from $8.25 yesterday, PVM said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
