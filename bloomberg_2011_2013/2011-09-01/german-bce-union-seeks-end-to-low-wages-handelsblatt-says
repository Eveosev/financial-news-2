Germany ’s IG BCE labor union, which
represents workers in the mining, chemical and energy
industries, called for an end to “low-wage strategies,”
Handelsblatt  said , citing union head Michael Vassiliades.  While relatively low wages paid to temporary workers or
trainees may save jobs in Germany when unemployment is high,
it’s now time to move away from that concept, he was quoted as
saying in an interview with the Dusseldorf, Germany-based
newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
