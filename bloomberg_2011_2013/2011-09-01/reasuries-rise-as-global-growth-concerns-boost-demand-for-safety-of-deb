Treasuries rose, extending gains
after their best month in more than two years, as a report
showed European manufacturing shrank more than initially
estimated in August, fueling concern global growth is slowing.  Longer-maturity debt led the advance as European shares and
U.S. stock futures fell, halting a rally in equities around the
world. Economists say reports this week will show U.S.
manufacturing contracted and job growth slowed. Treasuries
handed investors a return of 2.8 percent in August, the best
month since December 2008, according to indexes compiled by Bank
of America Merrill Lynch.  “Clearly the risks are to the downside and the flight to
quality may extend further,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-
income strategist at WestLB AG in  London . “We believe that
yields on both 10-year Treasuries and 10-year bunds are likely
to dip below the 2 percent level again.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell four basis points to 2.19
percent at 7:01 a.m. in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. The 2.125 percent note maturing in August 2021
rose 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 14/32.  Yields declined 57 basis points last month, the most since
a 71 basis-point drop in December 2008. Ten-year rates slid to a
record low of 1.97 percent on Aug. 18.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 0.5 percent, while futures
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.4 percent. German
10-year bund yields slipped six basis points to 2.16 percent.  Manufacturing, Jobs  A manufacturing gauge based on a survey of purchasing
managers in the 17-nation euro region fell to 49 from 50.4 in
July, Markit Economics said today. That’s below an initial
estimate of 49.7 published on Aug. 23. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  The  Institute for Supply Management  will say today that its
U.S. factory index slid to 48.5 in August from 50.9 in July,
according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. U.S. employers
added 70,000 workers after a 117,000 increase in July, a
separate survey showed before the Labor Department releases the
data tomorrow. Private hiring, which excludes government jobs,
rose 100,000 after a gain of 154,000 in the prior month, the
report may also show.  The August rally in Treasuries, the sharpest monthly
advance since the depths of the financial crisis, came as bond
investors cut expectations for inflation.  Operation Twist  The break-even inflation rate, the yield difference between
10-year Treasury notes and inflation-indexed U.S. government
bonds of similar tenor was 2.02 percent today, after falling to
1.96 percent on Aug. 18, the lowest since October. It has
averaged 2.06 percentage points over the past five years.  “Almost everyone is unhappy with the current yield
level,” said Sungjin Park, who heads the $58.1 billion debt
division in  Seoul  at Samsung Asset Management Co.,  South Korea ’s
largest private bond investor. “Treasuries are expensive.”  Fed Bank of Atlanta President  Dennis Lockhart  said
yesterday the central bank should be ready to consider more
monetary easing even while it can’t be expected to eliminate
some of the forces impeding economic growth.  “Given the weak data we’ve seen recently and considering
the rising concern about chronic slow growth or worse, I don’t
think any policy option can be ruled out at the moment,” he
said in a speech in Lafayette,  Louisiana .  Instead of conducting another large-scale round of
quantitative easing, the Fed may sell shorter-term securities
held in its portfolio and buy longer-dated bonds in a so-called
operation twist, said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist in  Tokyo  at
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc., a unit of  Japan ’s third-largest
publicly traded bank by assets.  “That may push down yields of long-term bonds and flatten
the yield curve for a short period,” Shimazu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
