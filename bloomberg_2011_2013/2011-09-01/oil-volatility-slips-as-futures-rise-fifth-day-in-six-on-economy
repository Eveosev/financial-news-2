in August and jobless claims decreased.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in

percent this year.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was

The options fell 13 cents to 58 cents a barrel. October $95
calls, the next-most active option, fell 9 cents to 441 cents
with 1,810 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of
crude.  Puts outnumbered calls by 53 percent to 47 percent in
electronic trading on the Nymex.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
