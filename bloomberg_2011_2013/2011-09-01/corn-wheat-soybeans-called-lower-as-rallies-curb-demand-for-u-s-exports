What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel
lower on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that warm,
dry weather in the U.S. will accelerate plant maturity and
harvesting, boosting immediate supplies as demand slows
following a 27 percent jump in prices during the past two
months,  Mark Schultz , the chief analyst for Northstar Commodity
Investments Co. in Minneapolis, said in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 8 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago on speculation that the highest prices since 2008 will
slow demand for U.S. exports, Schultz said. Soybean-oil futures
are expected to open down 0.35 cent to 0.45 cent a pound, and
soybean-meal futures may open $2 to $3 lower for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 11 cents a bushel lower on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on reduced demand for U.S. exports as overseas
customers buy cheaper supplies from Russia, Ukraine and Canada,
Schultz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
