The Ukrainian government is
maintaining its May forecast for economic growth of 6.5 percent
next year under favorable conditions.  Under a worst-case scenario, gross domestic product growth
will be 5 percent in 2012, the Cabinet said in a resolution
published today on the website of the Ukrainian government.  This compares with an expectation of 4.5 percent growth for
this year. The economy expanded 3.8 percent in the second
quarter, the State Statistics Office said on July 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
