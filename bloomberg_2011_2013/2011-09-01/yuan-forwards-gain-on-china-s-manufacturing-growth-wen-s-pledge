Yuan forwards advanced after  China ’s
manufacturing expanded at a faster pace in August and Premier
 Wen Jiabao  said taming inflation tops the government’s agenda.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 50.9 last month, from
the 29-month low of 50.7 in July, the China Federal of Logistics
and Purchasing said in a statement. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion. The country’s top priority is stabilizing prices and
the government doesn’t plan to alter the direction of economic
policies, Premier Wen Jiabao wrote in an article in the ruling
Communist Party’s Qiushi magazine published today.  “The PMI data shed positive light on China’s economic
growth and it’s positive for the yuan,” said Banny Lam, an
economist in  Hong Kong  at CCB International Securities, a unit
of China’s second-biggest lender. “Yuan appreciation can also
help ease inflationary pressure in China.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.05 percent
to 6.2764 per dollar as of 4:43 p.m. in Hong Kong, a 1.7 percent
premium to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yuan slipped 0.05 percent to 6.3813 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency touched 6.3705 on Aug. 30, the strongest level
since the country unified the official and market exchange rates
at the end of 1993.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency climbed 0.03
percent to 6.3543. The People’s Bank of China set the  reference
rate  0.01 percent stronger at 6.3859 per dollar. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 0.5 percent on either side of the rate.  China faces increasing pressure for month-on-month gains in
consumer prices, Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing
Liu Shijin, deputy director of the State Council’s Development
and Research Center. Liu said imported inflationary pressure has
weakened “somewhat,” while cost-driven inflation is a longer-
term phenomenon. Inflation reached a three-year high of 6.5
percent in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
