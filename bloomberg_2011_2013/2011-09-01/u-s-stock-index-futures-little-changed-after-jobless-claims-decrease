U.S. stock futures were little
changed following a four-day rally in American equities as
jobless claims decreased and investors awaited a report that may
show manufacturing shrank for the first time in two years.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring this
month fell 0.1 percent to 1,216.00 at 8:34 a.m. in  New York 
after sliding 0.8 percent earlier.  Jobless claims fell by 12 to 409,000 in the week ended
Aug.27, Labor Department figures showed today in  Washington .
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a drop to
410,000, according to the median forecast.  Stocks climbed yesterday, capping the  S&P 500 ’s biggest
eight-day gain since 2009, after reports showed that U.S.
business activity and factory orders expanded at a faster pace
than economists had forecast. The gains helped the S&P 500 trim
its August decline to 5.7 percent, still the biggest monthly
selloff since May 2010.  The S&P 500 plunged 18 percent from an almost three-year
high on April 29 through Aug. 8 as concern grew that the world’s
largest economy may relapse into a recession and  Europe  will
fail to contain its debt crisis. The retreat was led by
companies whose earnings are most-sensitive to the economy,
including financial firms, industrial manufacturers and energy
and raw-materials producers.   The index rebounded 8.9 percent from Aug. 8 through
yesterday after the plunge dragged its valuation to 12.2 times
the reported earnings of its companies, the cheapest level since
the  bull market  began in 2009. Gauges of S&P 500 utilities,
commodity producers, health-care companies and financials firms
rallied more than 10 percent to lead the recovery, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
