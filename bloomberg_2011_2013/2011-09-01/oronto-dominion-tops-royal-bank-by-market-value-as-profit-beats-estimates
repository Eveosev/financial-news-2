Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  surpassed
 Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  today as the largest Canadian company by
market value after the lender posted third-quarter profit that
topped analysts’ estimates.  Toronto-Dominion’s market value rose to C$71 billion ($72.8
billion) at 12:35 p.m. on the Toronto Stock Exchange, to Royal
Bank’s C$70.8 billion, according to Bloomberg data. Royal Bank
regained the top position a few minutes later.  Toronto-Dominion, Canada’s second-largest bank by assets,
today reported a 23 percent increase in profit and raised its
dividend for the second time in three quarters. Royal Bank, the
largest bank by assets, reported a net loss of C$92 million on
Aug. 26 because of a write-off on its U.S. consumer bank.  “TD is demonstrating its superiority as a dominant
franchise,” said  Bob Decker , a money manager at Aurion Capital
Management in Toronto who oversees about C$5.5 billion. “This
fact is not lost on investors who are finally fed up with the
chronic underperformance of Royal Bank.”  Royal Bank hasn’t ended a day with a market value less than
another Canadian company since February 2009, when  Barrick Gold
Corp. (ABX)  was the most-highly valued stock. Toronto-Dominion last
had a higher market value than Royal Bank in October 2000.  Last month, Royal Bank shares reached the lowest level in
two years on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
