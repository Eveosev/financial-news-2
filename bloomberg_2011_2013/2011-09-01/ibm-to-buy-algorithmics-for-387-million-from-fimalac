International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)  has agreed to buy Algorithmics, a supplier of risk
analytics software, for $387 million.  The purchase will add 900 employees to IBM’s team of more
than 8,000 consultants in the business analytics unit, Armonk,
New York-based IBM said in a statement today. Algorithmics,
based in Toronto, is a member of Fitch Group, which is majority
owned by Paris-based holding company  Fimalac (FIM)  SA.  IBM said its analytics offerings are backed by more than
$14 billion spent on acquisitions in the past five years,
including OpenPages Inc., a maker of compliance and risk
management systems. IBM has forecast its business analytics and
optimization activities will reach $16 billion in revenue by
2015 as companies sift their data for insights. Chief Executive
Officer  Sam Palmisano  last year said he would spend $20 billion
on acquisitions within five years.  “Combining Algorithmics’ expertise with IBM’s deep
analytics portfolio will allow clients to take a more holistic
approach to managing risk and responding to economic change
across their enterprises,” said Rob Ashe, IBM’s general manager
of business analytics.  IBM rose 18 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $172.09 at 11:58 a.m.
