Foodcorp Ltd.,  South Africa ’s third-
largest food company, said it will reinvest proceeds for the 600
million rand ($86 million) sale of its fishing unit in
existing businesses. The company’s bonds rallied.  The buyer can only be identified once all conditions of the
transaction have been met, Chief Financial Officer Ockert Janse
van Rensburg said in a telephone interview from Johannesburg
today. The deal may be completed within three months, the
company said in a statement.  The fishing division of Foodcorp, which also produces Nola
mayonnaise and Ouma rusks, includes consumer brands Glenryck
pilchards and Marpro, a premier deep-sea hake, monk kingklip and
rock lobster brand.  “Any proceeds that have not been used on capital
expenditure within 365 days will be returned to bondholders,”
Janse van Rensburg said. Yields on the company’s 390 million
euros ($555 million) 8.75 percent bonds due March 2018 declined
by 24 basis points to 11.20 percent by 4:43 p.m. in
Johannesburg, the lowest since Aug. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
