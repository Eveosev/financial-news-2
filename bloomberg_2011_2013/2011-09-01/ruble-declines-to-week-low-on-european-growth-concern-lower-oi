The ruble fell to the lowest level
in more than a week against the dollar as concern deepened that
European economies are slowing.  Russia’s currency lost 0.5 percent to 29 per dollar at the
7 p.m. close in Moscow, the weakest closing level since Aug. 23.  The euro depreciated against 15 of its 16 major peers as a
report showed European manufacturing contracted more than
initially estimated in August and investors speculated the
 European Central Bank  was supporting the  debt market .  “Weak data” and “rumors regarding renewed ECB bond
purchases are weighing on the euro,” Carolin Hecht, a currency
strategist at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said by e-mail.  The ECB bought Italian securities today, according to two
people with knowledge of the transactions, who declined to be
identified because the purchases are confidential. A spokesman
for the ECB declined to comment.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 29.2992 per
dollar in three months, compared with 29.3025 yesterday. The
contracts provide a guide to expectations of currency movements
and interest-rate differentials and allow companies to hedge
against currency shifts.  The ruble depreciated 4.2 percent against the dollar in
August, the worst performance among its three peers in the so-
called BRIC group of emerging-market countries.  Brazil ’s real
fell 2.5 percent against the greenback,  India ’s rupee slipped
4.1 percent and  China ’s yuan appreciated 0.9 percent.  The ruble was 0.7 percent stronger at 41.27 per euro,
leaving it steady at 34.5215 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Russia’s dollar bonds due 2020 rose for a sixth day,
pushing the yield down six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 4.146 percent. The country’s ruble Eurobond yielded
the same as yesterday, at 6.909 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
