Eni SpA Chief Executive Officer  Paolo Scaroni  is being investigated for alleged corruption in an
Italian probe of contracts obtained by its oil services company,
Saipem SpA, in Algeria.  “Eni acknowledges that the prosecutor has decided to
extend the investigation to include Eni and its chief executive
officer,” the Rome-based company said in a stock-exchange
statement. Newspaper la Repubblica earlier reported on its
website today that Scaroni was part of the probe.  “Eni and its CEO declare themselves totally unrelated to
the object of the investigation,” the company said.  Scaroni’s home and office were searched as part of the
probe, which focuses on 11 billion euros ($14.7 billion) of
Saipem contracts and 197 million euros in alleged bribes, la
Repubblica said. Eni is the largest investor in Saipem, Europe’s
biggest oil-service provider by market value.  Eni said that it will fully cooperate with the prosecutor’s
office in Milan.  Pietro Franco Tali  resigned as Saipem’s CEO in December
amid the investigation. Saipem in December also suspended the
chief operating officer of its engineering and construction
unit, Pietro Varone, who also is under investigation in the
probe, and another unidentified manager, the Milan-based company
said in December.  “Saipem believes that its business activities have been
conducted in compliance with applicable law,” it said Dec. 5.  Scaroni, 66, was appointed Eni CEO in June of 2005.  Eni shares fell 4.6 percent to 17.33 euros, its lowest
since Nov. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
