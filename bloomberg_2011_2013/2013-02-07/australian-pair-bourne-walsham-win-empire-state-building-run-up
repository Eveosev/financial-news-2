Australian endurance athlete Mark
Bourne won the 36th annual Empire State Building Run-Up,
climbing 86 floors in 10 minutes, 12 seconds.  Bourne, 29, was the top finisher in the elite men’s heat,
organized by the New York Road Runners. Suzy Walsham, 39, also
of Australia, won the woman’s invitational race, her fourth such
victory, with a time of 12:05.  Bourne and Walsham led a field of 738 entrants who ran the
1,576-stair course from the lobby to the observation deck of
midtown Manhattan’s tallest building. The race expects to raise
roughly $600,000 for a number of charities, including title
sponsor  Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation .  Runners aged 21 to 70 from 18 countries including Japan,
Israel and Papua New Guinea signed up to compete in the event,
first run in 1978. The race was invitation-only prior to 2011,
when MMRF first became the title sponsor and benefiting charity,
thanks in part to a $50,000 donation from SAC Capital Advisors
LP portfolio manager  Nick Tiller .  The course record of 9:33 was set by Australia’s Paul Crake
in 2003, according to the NYRR, which also organizes the New
York City Marathon.  Thomas Dold of Germany, winner each of the previous seven
years, dropped out prior to the race due to illness.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
