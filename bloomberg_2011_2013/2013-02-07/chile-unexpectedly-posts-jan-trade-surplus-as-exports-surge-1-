Chile posted a $244 million trade
surplus last month, surprising analysts who had forecast a
deficit, as exports and imports surged.  Exports rose 7.4 percent from the year earlier to $6.93
billion, while imports leaped 19 percent to $6.68 billion, the
central bank said in a report today. The median estimate of 12
analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg  was for a deficit of $120
million.  Imports will continue to increase this year as sales abroad
weaken, giving the Andean nation a $1.05 billion trade deficit
for 2013, according to the central bank’s latest forecasts. The
current account deficit will expand to 4.6 percent of gross
domestic product from 3.8 percent last year, the bank estimated.  “The central bank is certainly concerned with the widening
of the current account deficit but that needs to be addressed in
coordination with other policies, namely fiscal,”  Alberto Ramos , an economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., wrote in a note
to investors on Feb. 1.  While the central bank has kept  borrowing costs  unchanged
at 5 percent for 12 straight monthly meetings, the government
last quarter cut back on planned expenditures to help cool the
economy, Budget Director  Rosanna Costa  told reporters in
Santiago on Jan. 30.  Fiscal spending in the world’s top copper producer grew
about 4.7 percent above inflation in 2012, down from estimates
made in October for a 6.3 percent increase, Costa said.  Copper Exports  Chile exported $3.47 billion in copper last month, up 8.5
percent from the year earlier, the central bank said today.  Policy makers will monitor the current account gap, which
threatens to create vulnerabilities if demand for Chilean
exports falls faster than estimated, the central bank board said
in the Dec. 18 quarterly report accompanying its latest
forecasts.  Borrowing costs will increase a quarter-point by December
after remaining unchanged for at least the next five months,
according to analysts surveyed by the central bank on Jan. 9.  The peso, which has gained 1.6 against the U.S. dollar in
the past six months, rose by less than 0.1 percent to 472.60 per
dollar at 8:40 a.m. Santiago time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
