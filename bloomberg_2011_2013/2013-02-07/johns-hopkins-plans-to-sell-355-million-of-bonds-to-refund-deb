Johns Hopkins University  plans to
issue $355 million of taxable, fixed-rate bonds to refinance
outstanding debt.  The securities will probably be sold as soon as Feb. 11,
and proceeds will be used to refund debt including $200 million
of outstanding taxable bonds, according to a Feb. 4 Fitch
Ratings report. The debentures were rated AA+ by Fitch, Aa2 by
Moody’s Investors Service and AA by Standard & Poor’s. The
securities may come due between 2043 and 2053, according to
Moody’s.  The rating reflects the Baltimore-based school’s “status
as one of the preeminent research-based universities in the
country” with “highly competitive demand” for its
undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, Ken Rodgers,
a credit analyst at S&P, said in a Feb. 5 report.  In March 2009, the university sold $400 million of 5.25
percent securities due July 2019, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Those notes traded at 120.7 cents on the dollar on
Jan. 30 to yield 1.82 percent, or 95 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Dennis O’Shea, a spokesman at Johns Hopkins, said he
couldn’t immediately comment on the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
