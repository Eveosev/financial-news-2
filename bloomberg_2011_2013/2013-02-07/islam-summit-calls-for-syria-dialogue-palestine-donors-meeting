Leaders of Islamic nations agreed to
back an initiative proposed by Egypt to end the crisis in Syria,
stressing the need for a unified opposition and efforts that
ensure the integrity of the nation in efforts to realize the
“just” aspirations of Syrians.  The call was made by Egyptian Foreign Minister  Mohamed Kamel Amr  in the closing statement of the two-day Organization
of Islamic Cooperation summit in Cairo, which grouped Muslim
leaders often at loggerheads.  OIC members agreed to hold a donors’ conference for the
Palestinians and to set up a financial “safety net” for them
through members’ donations, Amr said.  “The Palestinian cause remains a main challenge facing the
region on the path to achieving peace and stability,” Egyptian
President  Mohamed Mursi  said in the closing session aired on
state television today. The time and location for the donors’
conference is to be set within the coming few days, according to
Egypt’s state-run Middle East News Agency.  Member states also called for strengthening economic and
trade relations between them, Mursi said. “God’s will is with
this nation to rise up,” he said. “Our strength is in our
unity” he said.  Former Saudi Culture and Information Minister  Ayad Madani 
was appointed as the new secretary-general of the OIC, replacing
Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, the current Turkish head, whose term
expires next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
