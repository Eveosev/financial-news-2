 A so-called volatility squeeze in
gold prices may signal a rally to $1,900 an ounce for the first
time in more than 16 months, according to technical analysis by
Steel Vine Investments LLC.  Gold futures for April delivery have traded in a $200 range
on the Comex in New York since July 25, leading to a
contracting-triangle pattern of lower highs and higher lows that
may mean the precious metal will rebound, said  Spencer Patton ,
Vine’s chief investment officer.  “When we get a breakout from a volatility squeeze, you get
a big move in the direction of the breakout, and the odds favor
the upside,” Patton said in a telephone interview from Chicago.
The pattern suggests that “the break-out is imminent,” he
said.  The April futures rose to a seven-month high of $1,801.80
on Oct. 5 after reaching a low of $1,596.90 on July 25. The
contract was down 0.2 percent today at $1,676.10 as of 12:26
p.m. in New York. By August, prices may rally 13 percent to
$1,900, the highest since Sept. 6, 2011, when the most-active
futures surged to an all-time high of $1,923.70, according to
Patton.  Gold rose 7 percent last year, the 12th straight annual
gain, as central banks from the U.S. to China took steps to
stimulate their economies.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
