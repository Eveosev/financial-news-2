New York Times Co. , the newspaper
publisher controlled by the Ochs-Sulzberger family, posted
fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as its
advertising decline slowed and online readership grew.  Net income tripled to $176.9 million, or $1.14 a share,
from $58.9 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier, the company
said today in a statement. The sale of About.com and a stake in
Indeed.com added $164.3 million in the quarter after taxes.
Excluding some items, profit was 32 cents a share, beating the
 31-cent  average of estimates  compiled by Bloomberg .  Times Co., led by Chairman  Arthur Sulzberger , is coping
with a difficult ad market as national marketing spending
continues to subside industrywide. Unlike regional newspapers,
the New York Times relies on national advertising from major
marketers such as movie studios, car companies and luxury goods
for most of its money. National advertising dropped 10 percent
across all newspapers in the first nine months of last year,
 according to the Newspaper Association of America . The company
also owns the Boston Globe and the International Herald Tribune.  Times Co., based in New York, rose 3.3 percent to $8.51 at
the close in New York. The shares have fallen less than 1
percent this year.  Advertising  slid 8.3 percent to $265 million from a year
earlier, excluding the effect of an extra week in the fourth
quarter of 2012. That decrease compared with an 8.9 percent
decline in the third quarter.  Digital Subscribers  Circulation sales rose 8.6 percent to $241 million.
Subscribers to online editions of the New York Times and
International Herald Tribune increased 13.1 percent from
September to 640,000. Total sales climbed 5.2 percent to $575.8
million. Analysts predicted $570.4 million.  The company said it expects total circulation sales to
expand by about 4 percent to 6 percent this quarter, largely
from gains in online subscriptions. Advertising through March
will decline at a similar rate to the previous quarter, the
company said.  80-20 Ratio  For the full year, Times Co. recorded more circulation
sales than ad revenue  for the first time , drawing in $953
million in subscription fees and $898.1 million in ad dollars.
It’s a milestone that upends the traditional 80-20 ratio between
ads and circulation that publishers once considered a healthy
mix and that is now no longer tenable given the industrywide
decline in newsprint advertising.  “They clearly are leaning on their readers to support the
business now,”  Edward Atorino , a media analyst with Benchmark
Capital Co. in New York, said in an interview after the report.
He rates the company’s shares as hold.  Times Co. said it contributed about $107 million to pension
plans in the fourth quarter. The plans were underfunded by about
$396 million at the end of 2012, down from the $525 million
Times Co. had reported a year earlier.  The company ended last year with $955 million in cash and
short-term investments, according to the statement. Times Co.
also reported $865 million combined in long-term debt and the
pension underfunding, as well as a $250 million option to
repurchase its headquarters by 2019.  Even with the Times Co.’s cash position, Chief Executive
Officer  Mark Thompson , who started in November, said on a
conference call that now isn’t “the appropriate time to restore
dividends.”  The Ochs-Sulzberger family, which controls voting shares,
received as much as  $20 million annually  from dividends until
the company stopped those payments at  end of 2008 .  The New York Times eliminated 30 newsroom jobs last month,
out of a total of 1,150, because of the slowdown in advertising.  More cost-cutting “is both inevitable and necessary as we
reshape our business,” Thompson said on the call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
