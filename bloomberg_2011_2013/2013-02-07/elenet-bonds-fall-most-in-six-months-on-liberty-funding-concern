Telenet Group Holding NV  bonds
dropped the most in six months on concern Liberty Global Inc.,
the cable operator’s biggest shareholder, will seek to increase
dividends to help finance the acquisition of Virgin Media Inc.  Telenet’s 6.25 percent bonds due 2022 dropped 1.8 percent,
or two cents on the euro to 103.85 at 11:26 a.m. in London,
their biggest decline since August 16, Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices show. The bonds of the Mechelen, Belgium-based company
were the biggest fallers in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Euro
Non-Financial High Yield Constrained Index.  Telenet faces a downgrade from Moody’s Investors Service if
Liberty Global decides to “make a shareholder distribution”
that would increase leverage beyond the limit of its current
high yield Ba3 grade, the ratings firm said in a statement.
Liberty agreed to pay $16 billion for Virgin this week to vie
with Comcast Corp. as the world’s largest cable operator.  “Generally the market sees Liberty Global re-leveraging
its European subsidiaries UnityMedia, UPC and Telenet to the
maximum allowed to help finance the Virgin deal,” said  Henry Craik-White , a senior investment analyst at ECM Asset Management
Ltd. in London. “Currently Telenet is the furthest away from
these leverage targets so their bonds have more downside.”  Virgin is marketing $3.6 billion of junk bonds to help
finance the transaction. It plans to sell 1.1 billion pounds
($1.7 billion) of senior secured notes maturing 2021 to yield
about 6 percent and $1 billion of similar-maturity bonds at 5.25
percent to 5.5 percent, according to a person with knowledge of
the deal, which is expected to price tomorrow.  Virgin is also offering 300 million pounds of senior notes
due 2023 at about 7 percent and $450 million of same-maturity
debt at 6.25 percent to 6.5 percent, the person said.  Tesco Debt  Tesco Plc , the U.K.’s largest grocer, is marketing its
biggest pound-denominated bond for two years. It plans to sell
500 million pounds  of senior secured amortizing bonds due 2044
to yield about 250 basis points more than gilts, a person with
knowledge of the deal said. The bonds are being issued through
Tesco Property Finance Plc.  In credit derivatives markets, the Markit iTraxx Europe
Index of credit-default swaps linked to 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell two basis points to 116. The
Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps on 50
companies with mostly speculative-grade ratings declined eight
basis points to 446.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on 25 banks and
insurers dropped two basis points to 156.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
