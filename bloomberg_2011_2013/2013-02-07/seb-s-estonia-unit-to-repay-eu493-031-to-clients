SEB AB  will repay Estonian clients
493,031 euros ($668,944) due to a technical glitch in
calculating interest payments, the Stockholm-based bank’s
subsidiary in the Baltic country said.  An error in the SEB Pank AS’s system, found at the end of
last year, caused the bank to keep charging interest on overdue
loan payments in addition to fines for delay, the Tallinn-based
bank said in an e-mailed statement today. It will repay 72,026
corporate and retail clients on 101,797 contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
