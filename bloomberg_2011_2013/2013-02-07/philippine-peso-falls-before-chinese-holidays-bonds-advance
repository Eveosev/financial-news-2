The Philippine peso declined for a
third day on speculation overseas investors are reducing their
holdings of the nation’s stocks before next week’s Chinese New
Year holidays. The government’s 25-year bonds gained.  Financial markets in Hong Kong will be closed for the first
three days of next week and those in Singapore and Malaysia will
be shut Feb. 11 and 12, although Philippine markets are open all
week. The local benchmark share index dropped by the most in two
weeks yesterday.  “This is largely being driven by the coming Chinese New
Year holidays,” said  Joey Cuyegkeng , an economist at ING Groep
NV in Manila. “Offshore players will close out their
positions.”  The peso dropped 0.2 percent to 40.722 per dollar as of
10:12 a.m. in Manila, the weakest level since Feb. 1, according
to prices from Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency reached 40.550
on Jan. 14, the strongest since March 2008, and has gained 0.8
percent this year. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options, was
little changed at 4.25 percent.  The yield on the 6.125 percent bonds due October 2037 fell
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 5.09 percent,
according to prices from Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
