Indonesia’s bonds advanced, pushing
the two-year yield to the lowest level since February 2012,
after foreign investors boosted holdings of the securities.
Rupiah forwards were little changed.  Global funds bought 3.35 trillion rupiah ($345 million)
more local-currency government debt than they sold in January,
finance ministry data show. They also increased their holdings
of the nation’s shares by $252 million this month through
yesterday, contributing to net purchases of $840 million in
2013. The rupiah’s one-month implied volatility, which measures
expected exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.5 percent for a fourth day.  The yield on the government’s 11 percent bonds due May 2023
dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 4.36
percent as of 3:34 p.m. in Jakarta, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show. That’s the lowest level since Feb. 22,
2012, for the benchmark two-year yield. The Finance Ministry
will offer three-year Islamic notes to individual investors with
a coupon of 6 percent from tomorrow through Feb. 22, it said
today. The government’s similar-maturity conventional debt
yields 4.49 percent.  “Capital inflows have been very strong and we expect them
to continue, especially since the rupiah has stabilized,” said
Fahrudin Haris Prastowo, a Jakarta-based foreign-exchange trader
at PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia. “The rupiah market onshore has
normalized and it now reflects real supply and demand with less
central bank intervention.”  Rupiah Quotes  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.05
percent to 9,715 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
They reached a three-year low of 9,985 on Jan. 10 and Jan. 11.
The contracts traded at a 0.2 percent discount to the spot rate,
which strengthened 0.15 percent to 9,695, prices from local
banks show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,727 today by the Association of Banks in Singapore, compared
with 9,684 yesterday.  Bank Indonesia will ask local lenders to create a new
benchmark as the Monetary Authority of Singapore investigates
the offshore fixing to determine whether there has been any
manipulation, Deputy Governor Hartadi Sarwono said today.
Malaysia’s central bank told local lenders to use an onshore
reference rate to settle foreign-exchange derivative contracts,
a person familiar with the matter said on Jan. 29.  Indonesian lenders have been  prohibited  from handling non-
deliverable forward contracts since June 2005, according to the
monetary authority. The Association of Banks in Singapore
provides offshore reference rates that are used to settle the
derivative contracts involving the currencies of Singapore,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
