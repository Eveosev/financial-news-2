The Australian dollar may fall to a
four-month low versus the U.S. dollar after breaking beneath a
level of so-called support, Commerzbank AG said, citing trading
patterns.  The Australian currency this week fell below its December
low at $1.0329, according to Bloomberg data, and now looks set
to decline to levels last seen in October,  Karen Jones , head of
foreign-exchange, fixed-income and commodities technical
analysis in London, wrote today in a note to clients.  “We continue to view the market as a top and look for a
slide to the $1.0149 October 2012 low,” Jones wrote. “We do
have a support line drawn from the 2009 lows at $1.0280, but
this should only act as temporary support.”  The Australian dollar fluctuated against the greenback
today, trading little changed at $1.0314 at 8:35 a.m. New York
time after declining as much as 0.2 percent to $1.0297, matching
the lowest level since Nov. 16. The last time it traded at
$1.0149 was on Oct. 8.  The Aussie may encounter an area of resistance around the
Jan. 18 low at $1.0486, Jones added.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  Resistance refers to an area on a graph where analysts
expect sell orders to be clustered, while support is where buy
orders are anticipated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
