Japanese shares fell, with the  Nikkei
225 Stock Average  retreating from its highest close since 2008,
amid earnings concern as  Nikon Corp.  plunged after trimming its
outlook on slowing demand from Europe.  Camera-maker Nikon lost 19 percent to lead declines on the
Nikkei 225. Yamaha Corp. slumped 16 percent after the piano
maker cut its net-income forecast to zero. Nippon Paper Group
Inc. surged 13 percent after reversing a loss.  Mazda Motor Corp. 
added 12 percent after the carmaker raised its operating-profit
forecast by 80 percent, citing a weaker yen.  The  Nikkei 225  dropped 0.9 percent to close at 11,357.07 in
Tokyo after yesterday finishing at its highest since Sept. 29,
2008. The broader Topix Index was little changed at 969.18, with
volume on the gauge 43 percent above the 30-day average.  “We are in a bull market, but investors are still
concerned about earnings,” said Koji Toda , chief fund manager
at Resona Bank Ltd. in Tokyo, which oversees about 15 trillion
yen ($160 billion). “Some investors are selling shares today
because yesterday’s rally was excessive.”  The Topix has surged about 34 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14 on optimism the new government will take
aggressive steps to fight deflation. The gauge is trading at 1.1
times  book value , compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 1.4 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Earnings Results  Of the 198 companies on the Topix that have reported
earnings so far this quarter and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 63 percent have exceeded profit expectations. Some 53
percent missed sales projections, the data show.  Nikon, Japan’s third-biggest camera-maker, plunged the most
since 1985 after saying net income will probably be 38 billion
yen in the year ending March, compared with a previous forecast
of 60 billion yen. The stock slumped 19 percent to 2,139 yen.  Yamaha plummeted 16 percent to 866 yen, its biggest drop
since 2008,  after cutting its net-income forecast to zero from
an earlier projection of a 3.5 billion-yen gain. The maker of
musical instruments trimmed its operating-profit outlook 36% to
7 billion yen.  Nippon Paper jumped 13 percent to 1,492 yen after reporting
a 7.5 billion net profit, swinging to a gain after a 39.8
billion yen loss in the year-earlier period. The company
maintained its fiscal-year outlook.  Mazda  added 12 percent to 317 after more than doubling its
net-income forecast to 26 billion yen in the 12 months ending
March 31. The stock soared 82 percent year-to-date as the weaker
yen makes its automobiles more profitable abroad.  Sony Posts Loss  Sony Corp., reporting results after the close of markets in
Tokyo, unexpectedly posted an eighth consecutive quarterly loss
on waning demand for TVs and consumer preferences for Apple Inc.
and Samsung Electronics Co. devices. The shares gained 2.6
percent to 1,519 yen before the announcement.  Japan’s machinery orders unexpectedly rose, gaining 2.8
percent in December from the month before, the Cabinet Office
reported today in Tokyo.  Fanuc Corp. , a maker of factory
robotics, added 1.2 percent to 14,790 yen.  Futures on the S&P 500 slid 0.1 percent today. The measure
added less than 0.1 percent yesterday as better-than-estimated
earnings outweighed concern over Europe’s debt crisis ahead of a
meeting of the monetary union’s central bank today.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index  added 6.1 percent
to 26.49, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.6 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
