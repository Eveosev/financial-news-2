Amgen Inc. , the world’s largest
biotechnology company, raised its full-year profit forecast
after federal tax settlements to an adjustment in charges for
this quarter.  Earnings excluding one-time items are now expected to be
$7.05 to $7.35, the Thousand Oaks, California-based company said
in a statement today. Amgen last month  forecast  2013 profit of
as much as $7.15. Analysts had expected $7, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Amgen is looking for new products and  acquisitions  as its
former core anemia business declines. Eight late-stage medicines
in development will generate data through 2016 and some may lead
to billions of dollars in sales, Chief Executive Officer  Robert Bradway  said today at a business review meeting in New York.
One, a heart medication called AMG-145, targets the cholesterol-
regulating gene PCSK9 in the liver. The other therapy,
romosozumab, grows bone for patients with osteoporosis.  “Several of these medicines we think have the potential to
be blockbusters,” Bradway said.  Amgen fell 1.6 percent to $85.22 at the close of trading in
New York. The shares had gained 23 percent in the 12 months.  Last year, the company agreed to buy gene researcher DeCode
Genetics Inc. for $415 million and gained an experimental
leukemia treatment by acquiring Micromet Inc. for $1.16 billion.
Amgen also signed a development deal with London-based
AstraZeneca Plc and boosted its presence in the cancer market
with Xgeva, a bone drug that reduces fractures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
