Credit Suisse Group AG  sold $171.4
million of one-year securities tied to the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index and the Chinese yuan, the bank’s largest
structured note in at least three years.  The securities, issued Feb. 1, yield twice the gains of the
benchmark adjusted for the exchange rate between the dollar and
the offshore renminbi, with a cap of 32.5 percent, according to
a  prospectus  filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. If the index declines, the notes suffer identical
losses, with all principal at risk. JPMorgan Chase & Co. charged
a 1 percent fee to distribute the securities.  Last month,  Deutsche Bank AG  and  Morgan Stanley  sold $37.7
million of notes in three offerings tied to the index and the
Hong Kong dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index has  gained  2.2
percent this year to 11,681.96 as of the close on Feb. 7.  Katherine Herring , a spokeswoman for the bank, declined to
comment on the offering. The sale is the bank’s largest since
Bloomberg began collecting comprehensive data on SEC-registered
structured notes in 2010.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
