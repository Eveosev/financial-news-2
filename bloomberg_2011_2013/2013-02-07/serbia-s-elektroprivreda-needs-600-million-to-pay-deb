Elektroprivreda Srbije JP, Serbia’s
state-owned utility, needs a 50 billion-dinar ($600 million)
loan to refinance debt and continue operations, acting Chief
Executive Officer  Aleksandar Obradovic  said.  The Balkan country’s dominant power producer, known as EPS,
faces a “critical period over the next two or three months” as
it needs to pay back as much as 20 billion dinars of short-term
debt, Obradovic said at a news conference in Belgrade today. EPS
is seeking loans from commercial banks, without state
guarantees, he added.  “We managed to reschedule some liabilities at the end of
last year but now we don’t have much room to maneuver,” he
said.  The government of Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic  appointed
Obradovic as CEO in September and wants him to merge some of the
utility’s units and cut costs, without selling it to private
investors. Its managing board was appointed by the previous
government whose leaders lost last year’s elections.  Obradovic urged the board to call a meeting to discuss
borrowing and restructuring plans. The company’s 2012 loss was
about 33 billion dinars, he said.  The state won’t rescue Elektroprivreda, Finance Minister
Mladjan Dinkic said at a separate news briefing in Belgrade
today. EPS “has the capacity to become a stable company with
its own resources,” he said.  Elektroprivreda also claims some 120 billion dinars in
unpaid bills, Chief Financial Officer Branislav Vukosavljevic
said. About half is owed by industrial consumers, mostly state
companies in receivership that are legally protected from being
cut off from the grid, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
