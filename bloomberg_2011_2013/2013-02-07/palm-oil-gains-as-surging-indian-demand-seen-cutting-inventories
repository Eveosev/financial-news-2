Palm oil advanced on speculation that
reserves in Malaysia may drop from a record as India, the
world’s largest importer, boosts purchases to meet a shortfall.  The contract for delivery in April gained 0.8 percent to
2,566 ringgit ($828) a metric ton by the 12:30 p.m. mid-day
break on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange in Kuala Lumpur.
Futures have gained 5.3 percent this year.  India’s purchases of cooking oils surged 74 percent to a
record 1.15 million tons in January from 659,979 tons a year
earlier, according to the median of estimates from five
processors and brokers compiled by Bloomberg.  Imports  of crude
and refined palm oils jumped 76 percent to 900,000 tons, the
survey showed. The Solvent Extractors’ Association of India will
publish data next week.  “India being a price-sensitive market, it will always look
for cheaper alternatives,”  Prathamesh Mallya , an analyst at
AnandRathi Commodities Ltd., said from Mumbai. “Malaysian
exports may gain as the zero-export duty would attract Indian
buyers. That would probably remove inventories from Malaysia.”  Stockpiles  of the oil used in food and biofuels fell 3.8
percent to 2.53 million tons in January from an all-time high of
2.63 million tons a month earlier, according to a Bloomberg
survey published yesterday. The Malaysian Palm Oil Board is due
to release the data on Feb. 13.  Malaysia, the largest producer after Indonesia, will allow
crude palm oil exports at zero duty for a third month in March
if prices remain below a threshold of 2,250 ringgit a ton,
Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister  Bernard Dompok 
said Feb. 4. The country set the tariff at zero in January and
extended it to February to clear the reserves.  Refined palm oil for delivery in September was little
changed at 7,130 yuan ($1,143) a ton on the Dalian Commodity
Exchange. Soybean oil for delivery in the same month dropped 0.5
percent to 8,768 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery declined 0.3 percent $14.8375 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybean oil for
March delivery lost 0.3 percent to 52.31 cents a pound. Soybean
oil  costs  about 1.39 times the price of palm oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
