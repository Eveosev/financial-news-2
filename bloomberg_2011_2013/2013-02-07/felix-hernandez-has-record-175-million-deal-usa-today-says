The Seattle Mariners and  Felix Hernandez  agreed on a seven-year, $175 million contract that
would make him the highest-paid pitcher in Major League Baseball
history,  USA Today reports , citing an unidentified person
familiar with the contract.  Hernandez, a 26-year-old right-hander, has a 98-76 record
with a 3.22 earned run average over eight seasons with the
Mariners and won the Cy Young Award in 2010 as the best pitcher
in the American League. Seattle hasn’t reached the playoffs
since Hernandez made his major-league debut at age 19 in 2005,
with two winning seasons in that span.  Hernandez’s contract would surpass the seven-year, $161
million deal that the New York Yankees gave  CC Sabathia  before
the 2009 season as the richest for a pitcher in MLB history.
It’s annual value of $25 million eclipses the $24.5 million that
 Zack Greinke  will get each season from the Los Angeles Dodgers
under a six-year, $147 million contract signed in December.  Hernandez was set to make $19.5 million this season and $20
million in 2014 under the five-year, $78 million deal he signed
in January 2010, USA Today said. At the time, Hernandez was
coming off a season in which he went 19-5 with a 2.49 ERA and
then went 13-12 with a 2.27 ERA in 2010 to win the AL Cy Young.
He went 13-9 with a 3.06 ERA last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
