Australian employers added part-time
jobs in January and fewer people hunted for work, helping keep
the unemployment rate unchanged, as interest rates at a half-
century low support hiring.  The number of people employed rose 10,400 from December,
the statistics bureau said in Sydney today, as part-time
positions advanced by 20,200. The gain compared with the median
estimate for a 6,000 increase in a Bloomberg survey of 25
economists. The unemployment  rate  held at 5.4 percent as about
30,000 new jobs in resource-rich Queensland state offset a
similar decline in the manufacturing hub of Victoria.  The data underscore the two-speed nature of the world’s
12th-largest economy, which has been driven by investment in
resources to meet Chinese demand. Reserve Bank of Australia
Governor  Glenn Stevens  lowered interest rates by 1.75 percentage
points since Nov. 1, 2011, to revive industries including
construction as mining investment crests.  “Employers aren’t keen to hire unless they have to, given
the global uncertainties,” said  Savanth Sebastian , an economist
in Sydney at a unit of Commonwealth Bank of Australia. “But
while jobs are being lost in some industries, clearly they are
being created in other industries.”  Rate Bets  The Australian dollar was at $1.0308 at 12:12 p.m. in
Sydney, versus $1.0317 before the data were released.  Traders are pricing in a 54 percent chance the central bank
will extend a rate pause next month, swaps data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The RBA left the overnight cash-rate target
unchanged at 3 percent this week.  The number of  full-time jobs  declined by 9,800 in January,
today’s report showed. Australia’s participation rate, a measure
of the labor force in proportion to the population, fell to 65
percent in January from 65.1 percent a month earlier, it showed.  The December jobs figure was revised to a 3,800 decline,
smaller than the 5,500 decrease reported a month ago.  The unemployment rate of 5.4 percent is below the U.S.’s
7.9 percent and less than half the euro area’s 11.7 percent.  The result “potentially suggests the labor market is
tighter than many commentators have been touting recently,”
said  Paul Bloxham , chief economist for HSBC Holdings Plc in
Sydney and a former RBA official who forecast a 15,000 rise in
jobs. “This steady labor market result is unlikely to trigger
the RBA to cut rates again.”  Job Moves  Cotton On Clothing Pty, a Geelong, Victoria-based retailer,
will expand its headquarters and create 500 jobs, the state
government announced late last year. Victoria Premier Ted
Baillieu said Nov. 16 the new jobs would increase total
employment at Cotton On to about 1,300 and ensure business
operations remain in the region.  Boral Ltd. announced last month it will cut about 700 jobs
in Australia to save about A$90 million ($93 million) annually.
About 200 of the redundancies occurred in late 2012, and most of
the rest will be completed by March, the Sydney-based building
materials company said Jan. 16.  “Looking ahead, with the labor market softening somewhat
and unemployment edging higher, conditions are working to
contain pressure on labor costs,” Stevens said this week.  In New Zealand, government data today showed employers
unexpectedly cut payrolls for a third straight quarter, the
longest slump since the 2009 global recession.  The Australian dollar climbed 0.3 percent to NZ$1.2327,
snapping two days of declines against the so-called kiwi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
