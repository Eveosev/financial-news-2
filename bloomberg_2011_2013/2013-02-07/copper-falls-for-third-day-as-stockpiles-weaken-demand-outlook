Copper fell for a third day as higher
stockpiles pointed to weaker demand amid a resurgence in concern
that Europe’s debt crisis will continue to drag on the global
economy.  Copper for three-month delivery fell as much as 0.2 percent
to $8,231.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange, and
traded little changed at $8,239 at 11:34 a.m. in Beijing.  Copper inventories monitored by Comex in New York rose to
74,457 tons yesterday, the highest level since May, while
 stockpiles  monitored by the LME gained for a second day to
386,500 tons, the highest since December 2011. European Central
Bank policy makers meet today as political and banking turmoil
threatens to renew the region’s sovereign-debt crisis, with the
Spanish Prime Minister facing calls to resign and Italy’s Banca
Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA facing criminal probes.  “There is no indication of bullishness from the demand
side,” Fang Junfeng, an analyst at Shanghai Cifco Futures Co.,
said by phone from Shanghai. “The problems facing the European
region have led some traders to see the outlook for the global
economy as negative.”  Copper for delivery in May fell 0.5 percent to 59,570 yuan
($9,550) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  On the LME, aluminum, zinc, nickel and lead also fell,
while tin climbed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: William Bi in
