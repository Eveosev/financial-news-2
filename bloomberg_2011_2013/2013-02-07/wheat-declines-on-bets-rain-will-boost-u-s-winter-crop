Wheat fell for the fifth time in six
sessions on speculation that rain will boost the winter crop in
the U.S., the world’s biggest exporter.  The southern Great Plains, the main growing area for the
winter variety used to make bread, has a chance of precipitation
in the next six to 10 days following six months of dry
conditions, while normal to above-average rain and mostly warm
weather will benefit plants in the eastern Midwest, Telvent DTN
in Omaha, Nebraska, said in a report.  “We’re getting a little bit of rain coverage that is
desperately needed, and that’s going to improve the topsoil
moisture,”  Frank J. Cholly , a senior commodity broker at RJO
Futures in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “There’s a
lot of time left” for the crop to improve, he said.  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to settle
at $7.56 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price has dropped 3.9 percent since Jan. 30.  Kansas City Board of Trade  futures  traded 45 cents a bushel
above the Chicago price. The  premium  has tumbled 23 percent
since Jan. 31.  High-protein hard red winter wheat used mostly in bread
trades in Kansas City, and the CBOT offers the Midwest soft red
winter variety used in cakes and cookies.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
