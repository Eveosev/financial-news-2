     Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) --  OAO Sberbank , Russia’s biggest
lender, said net income advanced 9 percent in January compared
with a year earlier as the company made more loans to consumers.  Profit under Russian accounting standards rose to 31.8
billion rubles ($1.06 billion) from 29.2 billion rubles a year
earlier, according to a  statement  today on the Moscow-based
lender’s website. Net interest income, the difference between
what a bank earns from lending and what it pays on deposits,
gained an annual 19 percent to 57.8 billion rubles.  Sberbank, which controls about 45 percent of Russia’s
deposits, has become Europe’s fourth-largest bank by market
value as local lenders and the country’s economy weather the
debt crisis better than peers in western Europe.  “Sberbank remains the bank to own in Russia,” Luis Saenz,
head of equity sales and trading at BCS Financial Group in
London, wrote in e-mailed comments. “January is usually a quiet
month which explains just 0.5 percent monthly increase in retail
deposits and the 1.1 percent decline in corporate loans.”  Corporate lending fell to 7.38 billion rubles last month
from 7.46 billion rubles. Consumer loans advanced to 2.54
billion rubles from 2.53 billion rubles. Sberbank’s capital
adequacy ratio rose to 12.9 percent at the end of January from
12.6 percent in December.  Non-performing loans climbed to 2.74 percent of the bank’s
total lending in January from 2.69 percent the previous month.
Sberbank’s operating costs jumped 30 percent due to “increased
labor costs.”  Sberbank said on Jan. 15 that profit for 2012 increased 11
percent to 344 billion rubles.  Its  shares fell 0.7 percent to 106.17 rubles at 1:17 p.m.
in Moscow, paring this year’s gains to 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
