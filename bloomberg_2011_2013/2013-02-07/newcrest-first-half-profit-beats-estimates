Newcrest Mining Ltd. , Australia’s
largest gold producer, reported first-half profit 9.6 percent
higher than analyst estimates, pushing the company’s stock to
its biggest gain in almost five months.  Net income was A$320 million ($329 million) for the six
months ended Dec. 31, the Melbourne-based company said today in
a statement, compared with the median estimate of four analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg of A$292 million. Earnings were 51 percent
less than the A$659 million a year earlier, which were boosted
by price gains and an asset sale.  “Production is expected to be higher in the second half of
the 2013 financial year,” it said. Newcrest produced 953,331
ounces of gold in the six months to Dec. 31, 18 percent lower
than a year earlier, the company said.  Newcrest  shares  climbed 5 percent to A$24.52 at the close
in Sydney, their biggest advance since Sept. 14. Output for the
full year, estimated at the low end of a range of 2.3 million to
2.5 million ounces, will be driven by expansions at Cadia East
in New South Wales and Lihir in Papua New Guinea, Newcrest
reiterated today.  Newcrest kept its interim dividend unchanged at 12 cents a
share. Three analysts in the survey had predicted a payout of
four to 15 cents a share. The company will consider a higher
dividend in the future, while keeping a long-term goal to reduce
gearing ratio to around 10 percent from 16.9 percent, Chief
Executive Officer  Greg Robinson  said on a conference call after
the earnings.  Mines, Output  The dividend “indicates the board’s comfort with the cash
generating outlook for the company,” Credit Suisse AG analysts
 Michael Slifirski  and  Sam Webb  said today in a note to clients.
“This is a vote of confidence in both Cadia East and Lihir that
has perhaps not yet been recognised by the market.”  Gold producers are expanding mines and boosting output to
cope with rising costs and benefit from prices that have
increased for 12 consecutive years as Asian demand rose and
central banks boosted purchases. Spot gold, up 4.9 percent in
the six months to Dec. 31, was little changed at $1,672.30 an
ounce as of 4:14 p.m. in Melbourne.  The lower first-half profit was “primarily due to the
lower production and more reliance on higher cost ounces,” it
said today.  Sales fell 23 percent to A$1.81 billion in the first half,
while cash costs declined 6 percent to A$973 an ounce. Newcrest
is implementing a close review to improve performance of its 50
percent-owned Hidden Valley operation in Papua New Guinea
following a 17 percent drop in output in the period, it said.  “For the remainder of the 2013 financial year, Newcrest
expects higher production in line with achieving the bottom end
of guidance, and a subdued cost environment,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
