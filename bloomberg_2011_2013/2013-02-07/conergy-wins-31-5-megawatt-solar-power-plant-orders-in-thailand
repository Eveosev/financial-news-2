Conergy AG , the German solar-energy
company, won orders to build photovoltaic power plants in
Thailand with a total capacity of 31.5 megawatts.  Conergy will develop, supply and install three 10.5-
megawatt plants in the provinces of Suphanburi and Kanchanaburi
in western Thailand for a unit of Thai Solar Energy Company
Ltd., Conergy said today in a statement.  Hamburg-based Conergy seeks to increase its 10-percent
share of Thailandâ€™s solar market as the government supports the
renewable source to reduce energy imports, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
