DeVry Inc. , a for-profit college
operator, surged to its highest level since May in New York
trading after reporting profit and sales that topped analysts’
estimates and JPMorgan Chase & Co. upgraded the shares.  DeVry  climbed  20 percent to $31.39 at 10:07 a.m. It rose as
much as 23 percent to $32.20, the biggest gain since October.
The shares had fallen 32 percent in the past year before today.  New enrollment gains at DeVry’s Chamberlain and Carrington
colleges offset a decline in new students at DeVry University
The company has been moving into international markets in Brazil
and the Caribbean to provide additional sources of revenue as
Congress and state authorities investigate marketing practices
at for-profit education companies in the U.S.  “We were impressed by stellar results” in the company’s
units outside of DeVry University, and “recognize that DeVry’s
diversification strategy is working,”  Jeffrey Volshteyn , an
analyst at JPMorgan in New York, said today in a note. He raised
his  rating  on the shares to neutral from underweight and boosted
his 12-month price target to $28 from $22.  Profit excluding some items was 87 cents a share, Downers
Grove, Illinois-based DeVry said yesterday in a statement. That
beat the 59-cent average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue fell 3.6 percent to $505.2 million, exceeding
analysts’ projections of $496.4 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
