Iceland’s Baa3 credit rating outlook
was revised by Moody’s Investors Service to stable from
negative, based on the reduced event risk following the European
Free Trade Association Court decision in January.  The European Free Trade Association Court in Luxembourg
dismissed a case brought the EFTA Surveillance Authority, which
claimed the island had breached European Economic Area law. A
loss would have allowed the Netherlands and the U.K. to seek
damages of much as 335 billion kronur, according to
International Monetary Fund estimates.  The decision frees the government of the potentially large
costs related to the Icesave dispute with the British and Dutch
governments, Moody’s said in a statement.  Baa3 is the lowest investment-grade rating at Moody’s.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
