Birmingham City’s Hong Kong-based
owners said they’ve been approached by a potential buyer of the
English soccer team.  Birmingham International Holdings Ltd. said in a statement
yesterday that an unidentified sports management company
indicated on Jan. 23 and Jan. 31 it would be able to lead a
group that would consider buying the club.  “The company’s lawyers are currently in contact with the
interested party with the view to clarifying matters of this
approach,” the statement read.  Birmingham City was relegated from the elite Premier League
in May 2011, a month before its largest shareholder,  Carson Yeung , was arrested in Hong Kong on five counts of money
laundering. He denies wrongdoing, and in November won a delay of
his trial until April 29.  Shares in Birmingham International Holdings Ltd. have been
suspended from trading in Hong Kong since June 2011.  Birmingham is 16th in the second-tier Championship after 30
games, six points above the relegation zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
