Vestas Wind Systems A/S , the world’s
largest wind turbine maker, rose to the highest price in three
weeks in Copenhagen trading after Nordea Bank AB said the market
is showing signs of stabilization.  Vestas jumped as much as 10 percent to 40.55 kroner, the
highest since Jan. 14. The stock added 8.6 percent to 39.84
kroner as of 12:11 p.m. in the Danish capital with volume at 128
percent of the three-month daily average. The gain made the
stock today’s biggest winner in the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen 20
index.  Vestas shares rose 8.1 percent yesterday when the company,
which has struggled to make a profit amid industry overcapacity,
reported revenue that exceeded analyst estimates. Nordea today
raised its  recommendation  on the share to buy from hold, saying
there are signs that turbine prices are stabilizing, citing
interviews with wind industry organizations.  “The potential positive triggers outweigh the negative
ones,”  Patrik Setterberg , an analyst with Nordea in Copenhagen,
said in a note. “We expect orders from U.S. customers to pick up
for Vestas while order intake from European and Asian customers
is expected to stay at a stable level.”  Nordea raised its share price estimate by 10 percent to 44
kroner. That’s the fifth-highest among 21 analysts covering the
stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Aarhus, Denmark-based turbine maker said yesterday
fourth-quarter sales rose 25 percent from a year earlier to 2.5
billion euros ($3.39 billion). That exceeded the average
estimate of 2.3 billion euros in a survey of 14 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
