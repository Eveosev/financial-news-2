EnteroMedics Inc.  said its implanted
nerve-blocking therapy failed to help patients lose as much
weight as intended in a key obesity study.  The VBLOC vagal blocking therapy helped 53 percent of
patients shed at least 20 percent of their excess weight,
compared with 33 percent of volunteers in whom the device was
implanted but not turned on, the company said today in a
statement. The difference in weight loss, 24 percent in treated
patients and 16 percent in untreated patients, didn’t meet the
predetermined “super superiority” goal in the study involving
239 people, the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company said.  The device clearly had a positive effect on weight loss,
even though it didn’t meet the effectiveness goals, said Chief
Executive Officer  Mark Knudson . EnteroMedics plans to file for
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the technique in
the second quarter of 2013, he said.  “Based on these compelling results, and the totality of
our clinical experience with the Maestro System, which now
includes more than 600 patients worldwide, we believe
EnteroMedics is well positioned to deliver this novel therapy to
people with obesity in the U.S.,” Knudson said.  The Maestro Rechargeable System is a less-invasive method
than surgery to help obese people lose weight, the company said.
The device is attached by two small electrodes to the trunk of
the vagus nerve between the esophagus and the stomach. The
device uses high-frequency, low-energy electrical impulses to
reduce feelings of hunger.  To contact the reporter on this story:
