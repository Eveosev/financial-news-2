Toshiba Corp ., the Japanese maker of
products including flash-memory chips, elevators and steam
turbines, bought Consert Inc., adding a U.S. energy technology
management company.  Toshiba paid more than 1 billion yen ($11 million) for the
acquisition of the San Antonio, Texas-based, closely-held
Consert, Toru Ohara, a spokesman for the Tokyo-based company
said by phone today.  Buying Consert gives Toshiba control of its Virtual Peak
Plant technology that helps utilities manage power loads.  “The acquisition will add a new level of technology to our
smart community business,” Toshiba Corporate Vice President
 Takeshi Yokota  said in a statement. Consert’s operations will be
incorporated into Toshiba’s Landis+Gir AG electronic meter
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
