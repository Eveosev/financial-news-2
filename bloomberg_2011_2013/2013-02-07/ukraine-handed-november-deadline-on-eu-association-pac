Ukraine must seal a delayed accord to
bolster ties with the European Union at a November summit or
risk waiting years to sign the pact, the 27-member bloc said.  The former Soviet republic must demonstrate “swift and
tangible progress” on issues from selective justice to the
“shortcomings” of parliamentary elections held in October,
according to European Enlargement Commissioner  Stefan Fule .  “We can’t wait -- the window of opportunity is open now,”
Fule told reporters today in Ukraine’s capital, Kiev, after
meeting Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov . “Timing matters in
politics. And to generate a new political momentum, it will take
months if not years.”  The EU postponed indefinitely a planned Association
Agreement with Ukraine, including a free-trade accord, after ex-
Premier Yuliya Tymoshenko was jailed in a case the bloc deems
politically motivated. President  Viktor Yanukovych  has pledged
to resolve the Tymoshenko issue, even as prosecutors threatened
last month to imprison her for life for alleged murder.  “We can’t fail to react to the EU’s constant criticism on
this question,” Yanukovych said yesterday in the Lithuanian
capital of Vilnius before a Feb. 25 meeting with the EU in
Brussels. “It’s taking time to ensure the solutions we adopt in
the near future are in accordance with our legal and judicial
framework.”  Ukraine is scheduled to take part in the Eastern
Partnership Summit in Vilnius in November, when Lithuania will
hold the EU presidency. Yanukovych has targeted that meeting to
sign the Association Agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
