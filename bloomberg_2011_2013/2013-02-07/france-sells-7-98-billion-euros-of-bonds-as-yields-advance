France sold 7.98 billion euros
($10.82 billion) in debt as borrowing costs rose.  The treasury auctioned 3.02 billion euros of nine-year
securities at an average yield of 2.30 percent, compared with
2.07 percent at the last such sale on Jan. 3. It sold 3.19
billion euros of 14-year bonds were sold at a yield of 2.85
percent, compared with 2.56 percent in the last auction on Dec.
6. It also sold 1.77 billion euros of seven-year debt at an
average yield of 1.83 percent.  France’s second bond auction of the year comes as the
European Central Bank’s promise to keep the euro intact has
reduced investor concern about Italian and Spanish debt, pulling
down 10-year yields for those countries. That has shifted focus
to the real economy in France, where President  Francois Hollande 
is battling joblessness at a 15-year high. Economists say France
may have slipped into recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
