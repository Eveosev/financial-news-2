Apparel company PVH Corp. will
replace Big Lots Inc. in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index on a
date to be determined later, S&P said in a statement today.  Big Lots will take PVH’s spot in the S&P MidCap 400 Index,
and CommVault Systems Inc. will replace Warnaco Group Inc. in
that index. PVH, the New York-based owner of the Tommy Hilfiger
brand, is acquiring Warnaco in a transaction expected to be
completed soon, S&P said. Big Lots, the Columbus, Ohio-based
discount retailer with a market value under $2 billion, is
better suited for the midcap gauge, S&P said.  Titan International Inc. will replace CommVault Systems in
the S&P SmallCap 600.  Primerica Inc. will take the spot of Shaw Group Inc. in the
MidCap 400 benchmark after the close of trading on Feb. 12.
Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. is buying Shaw Group in a deal
expected to be completed around the date of the index change,
the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
