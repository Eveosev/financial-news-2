Starts Proceed Investment Co. , a
Tokyo-based real estate investment trust, plans to acquire about
10 billion yen ($107 million) of apartments as early as May, the
most since 2008.  Starts Proceed, the owner of 76 apartments, will add about
12 properties to its portfolio, said  Kazuya Hiraide , president
of Starts Asset Management Co., which manages the trust. Half of
the funding will be from a public offering, while the other half
will be from debt, he said.  J-REITs are benefiting from the Bank of Japan’s buying of
the trusts since 2010. The  Tokyo Stock Exchange  REIT Index had
its biggest increase last year, gaining 34 percent after a
decline of 26 percent in 2011. Public offerings by REITs this
year may exceed the 679 billion yen reached in 2007 because of
measures introduced by the government to boost the market, said
 Junichi Tazawa , a REIT analyst at Barclays Plc in Tokyo.  “J-REITs have experienced one full cycle,” said Hiraide
in a Feb. 6 interview. “We have now entered the next stage.”  The acquisition will boost Starts Proceed’s portfolio by a
quarter to about 50 billion yen, he said.  J-REITs may raise 700 billion yen this year through initial
share sales and additional offerings, from 480 billion yen last
year, Tazawa of Barclays said.  The BOJ has acquired about 85 percent of the 130 billion
yen in J-REITs it plans to buy, according to the bank’s data as
of Jan. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
