Greek lawmakers demanded action be
taken to stop colleagues from breaking a law banning smoking in
Parliament, saying failure to do so undermines public faith in
the legal system.  “This image being presented by Parliament of lawmakers
being indifferent to the laws they themselves vote for and even
worse violating them by smoking everywhere has to be reversed,”
lawmakers said in a statement accompanying a letter addressed to
Parliament speaker  Evangelos Meimarakis . The letter was signed
by 88 of Greece’s 300 members of Parliament.  Greece has repeatedly failed to implement laws banning
smoking, including the latest legislation that prohibited
puffing in all enclosed public and private workplaces that was
passed in 2010.  “There is no respect for the law or the health problems
some non-smokers face,” lawmakers including former Health
Minister  Andreas Loverdos  said in the letter, according to an e-
mailed copy.  Signatures came from the parties that support Prime
Minister  Antonis Samaras ’s coalition government, New Democracy,
Pasok and Democratic Left, as well as the main opposition Syriza
party and independent lawmakers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
