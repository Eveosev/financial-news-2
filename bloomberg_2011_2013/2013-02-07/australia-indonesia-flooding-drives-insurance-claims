Severe flooding in Australia and
Indonesia and the worst tornado outbreak in the U.S. since 2008
drove global insurance costs in January, causing covered losses
of about $800 million.  The Australia floods killed at least six people and
generated $313 million in insured losses,  Aon Plc ’s Impact
Forecasting said yesterday in a report. Economic losses in
Queensland alone totaled $2.5 billion. The nation endured
flooding in 2011 that led to about $1.6 billion in insured
losses.  “The fact that they’ve seen in two of the last three years
multibillion-dollar flood events is certainly the biggest
takeaway globally,” Steve Bowen, a senior scientist and
meteorologist at Impact Forecasting, said in a phone interview.  Torrential rains flooded Jakarta, killing at least 41
people, damaging or destroying more than 100,000 homes and
causing insured losses exceeding $311 million. The Indonesian
government said economic damage was $3.3 billion, according to
the report. The flooding was the worst in the region since 2007.  A flurry of tornadoes in the U.S. in late January killed at
least three people and may have caused as much as $75 million in
insured losses, according to the report. Fifty tornadoes touched
down during the period, tying 2008 as the largest January
outbreak since 1950.  Wildfires in Australia last month led to about $100 million
in insured losses, most of it in Tasmania, Impact Forecasting
said. The company is a catastrophe modeler owned by Aon, the
London-based insurance broker.  The Northern Hemisphere didn’t see a major winter weather
event last month, according to the report. Europe escaped
without experiencing a strong windstorm akin to Klaus in 2009,
Kyrill in 2007 or Erwin in 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
