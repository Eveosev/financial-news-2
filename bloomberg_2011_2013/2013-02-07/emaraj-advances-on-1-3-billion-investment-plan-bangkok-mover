Hemaraj Land & Development Pcl ,
Thailand’s biggest developer of industrial land by market value,
gained the most in a month in Bangkok share trading after
announcing a $1.3 billion investment plan.  Hemaraj  jumped  5.5 percent to 3.84 baht at 12:02 p.m. local
time, heading for the biggest gain since Jan. 9. The benchmark
 SET Index  dropped for a third day, losing 0.5 percent.  Bangkok-based Hemaraj, which develops manufacturing
facilities for companies including  Ford Motor Co.  and
 Caterpillar Inc. , will boost investment in industrial land,
utilities, power plants and property development over the next
five years as demand grows, Chief Executive Officer David
Nardone said in a statement yesterday. Applications for
investment incentives in Thailand more than doubled to a record
1.46 trillion baht ($49 billion) last year, the government said
on Jan. 10.  “The increase in foreign direct investment will boost
demand for Hemaraj’s land,”  Surachai Pramualcharoenkit , an
analyst at Trinity Securities Co., wrote in a report today.
“The rising number of manufacturers at its industrial parks
will also boost revenue from sales of electricity, water and
other utilities.”  Hemaraj may see “outstanding” earnings growth over the
next two to three years, Surachai wrote.  The company expects revenue from land sales to grow at a
“double-digit” pace to 640 acres (259 hectares) in 2013,
according to Nardone. Revenue from its utility business will
climb 20 percent this year to 2 billion baht ($67 million), he
said.  -- Editors: Matthew Oakley, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
