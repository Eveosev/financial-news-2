India rejected a U.S. claim that it
violated World Trade Organization rules on solar equipment
purchases, said Tarun Kapoor, joint secretary in the Ministry of
New & Renewable Energy.  India is set to begin talks with the U.S. over the
complaint filed with the WTO, he said in New Delhi. The U.S.
Trade Representative’s office complained that Indian law
requires its solar-energy producers to use domestically
manufactured solar cells and modules and gives subsidies to
companies that use Indian equipment in preference to imports,
according to an e-mailed statement from Washington.  The U.S. complaint was about India’s solar equipment
purchase for 350 megawatts of capacity, Kapoor said. India is
currently building 1,000 megawatts of solar power plants and is
in the process of tendering for 2,000 megawatts more projects,
he said. There are no restrictions on these capacities, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
