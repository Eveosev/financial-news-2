DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. ,
producer of the “Madagascar” films, may fire as many as 20
percent of its Southern California employees after delaying the
release of “Me and My Shadow,” a union official said.  The studio is considering cuts of 250 to 450 jobs from a
staff of about 2,200 at its campus in Glendale, California, and
an unspecified number at its Pacific Data Images facility in
Redwood City, California,  Steve Hulett , business representative
for the Animators Guild, said today in an interview.  Shannon Olivas , a DreamWorks Animation spokeswoman,
declined to comment. Hulett said the estimates were based on
conversations with company employees. He pegged the Redwood City
staff at about 1,500.  “Me and My Shadow,” described as a groundbreaking
combination of computer-generated and traditional animation, was
put back in development, DreamWorks Animation said yesterday.
The studio’s “Mr. Peabody & Sherman,” planned for theaters in
November 2013, will now come out on March 7, 2014, cutting this
year’s release schedule to two films from three.  DreamWorks Animation  fell  2.6 percent to $16.31 at the
close in New York after dropping 3.9 percent yesterday. The Los
Angeles Times reported on the extent of the job cuts late
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
