Danske Bank A/S  may keep its Danish
longer-term refinancing operations for the full three years and
repay some of its similar loans under the European Central Bank
program first, Chief Executive Officer  Eivind Kolding  said.  The ECB LTRO loan “is for us very much a commercial
decision,” Kolding said in an interview in Copenhagen today. “We
have now to some extent better alternative financing
opportunities, so we might repay some of it.”  Danske, Denmark’s largest lender, said today in its 2012
earnings report that it had drawn a total of about 40 billion
kroner ($7.3 billion) on ECB’s LTRO facilities by the end of
last year. Danske has borrowed 35 billion kroner at the Danish
central bank’s LTRO auctions in March and September, the
Copenhagen-based lender said.  The terms of the Danish LTRO loans “are a little bit
different,” Kolding said. “You can base it on some assets that
you can’t fund otherwise. So the Danish we’ll probably keep for
a longer time. It’s a three-year program, and we could keep it
that long if it makes commercial sense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
