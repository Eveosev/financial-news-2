Electricite de France SA’s talks with
the U.K. over building nuclear power plants are making “good
progress” before the company decides whether to go ahead.  “We are in talks on the contract with the British
government,” Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  said today
at a renewable energy conference in Paris. “The negotations are
progressing well. We have passed many stages.”  Proglio, who heads the world’s biggest nuclear-reactor
operator, said three days ago the French utility may drop plans
to develop them in the U.K. unless the country ensures projects
are profitable. His remarks followed Centrica’s statement that
it had abandoned a plan to invest with EDF in the U.K. because
of rising costs and delays. Centrica had an option to take a
stake in four new reactors at two of EDF’s power stations.  “It’s not a problem,” Proglio said today of Centrica’s
decision. “There is no problem for partnership.”  He has previously said EDF held talks on the U.K. projects
with China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Co. and there are other
possible partners. EDF can’t ask partners to join as long as
they aren’t “clearly structured,” Proglio said on Feb. 4.  The French utility and U.K. government are negotiating how
much EDF will earn for power generated at the new plants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
