Gabon plans to export eight crude
cargoes in March while Cameroon will ship one lot next month,
unchanged from February, according to loading programs obtained
by Bloomberg News.  Gabon will ship three lots of Rabi Blend, two each of Rabi
Light and Mandji grades and one of Oguendjo next month, the
schedules show. The consignments range from 600,000 barrels to
930,000 barrels. The West African nation shipped two lots of
Rabi Light in February, according to a partial program.  Cameroon is set to export one 800,000 barrel lot of Kole
next month, unchanged from February, a separate plan shows.  Loading programs are monthly drafts of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
