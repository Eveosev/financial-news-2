Oil deliveries from  Chevron Corp .
fields in Indonesia’s Riau province are likely to return to
normal today after delays caused by a pipeline leak, according
to the country’s energy regulator.  The Feb. 5 breach on the 76-kilometer (47 miles) line
disrupted deliveries of oil from the Bangko area to the Dumai
terminal,  Gde Pradnyana , deputy of operations at SKK Migas said
in e-mailed statement. Production at Chevron’s fields has not
been affected and output is being stored in tanks amid repairs
to the pipe, he said.  PT Chevron Pacific Indonesia produced 327,692 barrels of
oil a day as of Jan. 27, representing about 40 percent of
Indonesia’s oil output, according to data from the regulator.  Chevron Pacific Indonesia’s response team has contained the
leak and begun clean-up work, Alexander Yelland, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “We are
working to minimize any impact to production” he said. “The
cause of the incident is currently being investigated.”  The pipeline delivers output from the Duri field in the
Rokan oil block, Yelland said.  Indonesia is trying to stem a decline in maturing fields
amid a lack of new discoveries. Oil output may shrink to 830,000
barrels a day this year, the lowest since 1969 when Indonesia
produced 742,000 barrels, according to data from SKK Migas on
Feb.1. That would also be less than the government’s sales
target of 900,000 barrels a day in the 2013 state budget.  To contact the reporter on this story:
