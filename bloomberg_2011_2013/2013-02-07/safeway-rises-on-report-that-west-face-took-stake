Safeway Inc ., the second-largest U.S.
grocery-store chain, rose after the Globe & Mail reported that
activist fund West Face Capital Inc. recently acquired a
minority stake in the company.  Safeway advanced 4.9 percent to $20.34 at the close in New
York. The  shares  have dropped 4.6 percent in the past 12 months,
compared with a 16 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Consumer Staples Index.  West Face, based in Toronto, said investors are ignoring
the value of Safeway’s Blackhawk gift-card business and Canadian
supermarket business, the newspaper said, citing a letter it
obtained.  Net income at Safeway, which announced in January that
Chief Executive Officer  Steven Burd  is retiring this year,
dropped in 2011 and was forecast to fall last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In September, the company said it
was planning an initial public offering of a minority stake in
Blackhawk Network Holdings Inc., which provides prepaid
products, such as restaurant gift cards, to retail and grocery
stores.  To contact the reporter on this story:
