Platinum ’s rally stalled in New York
on speculation mining companies will increase sales to take
advantage of prices at a 16-month high.  The platinum industry faces “a number of issues,” Mark
Cutifani, who takes over as chief executive officer of Anglo
American Plc in April, said in South Africa today. Returning the
company’s platinum unit to profitability will be his main
challenge after strikes last year wiped out earnings, Anglo
American’s outgoing CEO Cynthia Carroll said yesterday.  “Producers need to take advantage of high prices,” said
 Bernard Sin , head of currency and metal trading at precious
metals refiner MKS (Switzerland) SA in Geneva. “The days of
platinum trading cheaper than gold are over.”  Platinum for April delivery was little changed at $1,736.30
an ounce by 7:38 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Futures yesterday rose to $1,744.50 an ounce, the highest price
since September 2011. Gold futures were little changed at
$1,678.30 an ounce, silver fell 0.2 percent to $31.81 an ounce
and palladium rose 0.1 percent to $765.15 an ounce.  Platinum traded above gold in London last month for the
first time since April.  Platinum has jumped 13 percent this year and palladium is
up 8.8 percent, compared with gains of 5.2 percent for silver
and 0.1 percent for gold. Platinum and palladium are typically
found together in mines and are mostly used in pollution-control
devices in cars. Trading in all the precious metals in New York
is below the average for the past 100 days for this time of day,
with palladium volume down 47 percent and silver volume down 44
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
