U.S. mortgage rates for 30-year fixed
loans held at a four-month high as job growth helps fuel demand
for housing.  The average  30-year  rate was unchanged at 3.53 percent in
the week ended today, the highest since Sept. 13, McLean,
Virginia-based  Freddie Mac  said in a statement. The average  15-
year  rate dropped to 2.77 percent from 2.81 percent.  U.S. home prices are recovering as buyers compete for a
shrinking  supply  of listings and employment improves. Payrolls
increased by 157,000 workers in January following a revised
196,000 gain the prior month and a 247,000 jump in November,
Labor Department figures showed Feb. 1.  “The job numbers are good enough to keep the current
momentum we have in the housing market,”  Millan Mulraine , a New
York-based economist at TD Securities LLC, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “But for the housing recovery to shift up
a gear or two to generate significant economic growth, it will
be necessary for employment to accelerate.”  U.S. home prices rose 8.3 percent in December from a year
earlier, the biggest jump since May 2006, Irvine, California-
based CoreLogic Inc. reported this week.  The Mortgage Bankers Association’s  index  of home-loan
applications climbed 3.4 percent in the week ended Feb. 1, the
Washington-based group said yesterday. The  refinance  gauge
advanced 3.5 percent, and the  purchase  measure rose 2.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
