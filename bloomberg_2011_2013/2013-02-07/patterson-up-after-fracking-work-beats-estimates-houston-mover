Patterson-UTI Energy Inc.  climbed the
most in more than three years after reporting sales from
hydraulic fracturing work that surpassed analysts’ expectations.  Patterson rose 10 percent to $22.90 at the close in New
York, the biggest gain for the Houston-based company since April
21, 2009.  Fourth-quarter hydraulic fracturing revenue rose 16 percent
from the third quarter to $212 million, the company said in a
statement. That’s higher than the $177 million expected from
 Scott Gruber , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New
York, according to a note to investors.  “Patterson posted encouraging 4Q results suggesting
activity in North America is recovering and Patterson is gaining
share, with particularly good results for pressure pumping,”
Gruber wrote today.  The  company  provides drilling rigs and a pressure-pumping
technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which blasts water
mixed with sand and chemicals underground to free trapped
hydrocarbons from shale formations.  The company said it added 13,500 horsepower of fracking
equipment in a quarter when several fracking service providers
have stopped adding gear and are parking some unused equipment,
according to the statement.  “Congratulations, guys, on making all the other pressure
pumpers look like dorks,”  Marshall Adkins , an analyst at
Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston, said today on a
company conference call with analysts and investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
