The euro was poised for its biggest
five-day drop in seven months after European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said recent currency gains may slow
inflation and growth, damping demand for the region’s assets.  The 17-nation currency traded 0.3 percent from a two-week
low against the greenback as European Union leaders meet in
Brussels to seek agreement on the 2014-2020 budget. Australia’s
dollar erased earlier declines after data showed exports and
imports in China, the South Pacific nation’s largest trading
partner, rose more than economists forecast. The yen is poised
for an unprecedented 13th weekly decline versus the greenback as
Japan posted back-to-back monthly current account deficits for
the first time since at least 1985.  “The risks of a rising currency to economic growth in the
region is something that the market has taken note of, and the
ECB delivered a stark reminder that their policy will remain
accommodative,” said  Jim Vrondas , the chief currency and
payments strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at OzForex Ltd.
in Sydney. “Their actions should continue to serve to weaken
the euro.”  The  euro  traded at $1.3407 as of 11:33 a.m. in Tokyo, set
for a 1.7 percent weekly drop, the steepest since July. It
yesterday touched $1.3371, the least since Jan. 25. The currency
fetched 125.43 yen from 125.44 in New York, sliding 0.9 percent
since Feb. 1, its first five-day drop in nine weeks.  The yen added 0.1 percent to 93.53 per dollar, on course
for a 0.8 percent decline this week.  Europe’s shared currency has strengthened 2.3 percent this
year, the best performer of 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
gained 0.5 percent and the yen tumbled 7.6 percent.  Euro Strength  There are downside risks to inflation “stemming from
weaker economic activity and, more recently, the appreciation of
the euro exchange rate,” according to a statement of remarks
from Draghi yesterday placed on the ECB’s website.  The central bank kept its  benchmark rate  at a record-low
0.75 percent as forecast by economists in a Bloomberg News
survey.  A promised EU investment budget to modernize the recession-
hit economy is set to be scaled back amid competing national
demands. A summit deadlock over the 2014-2020 budget would
hobble subsidy programs, force the EU to fall back to annual
budget extensions and add to concerns about Europe’s political
cohesion.  The yen traded 0.6 percent from its lowest since May 2010
versus the dollar as the Ministry of Finance reported a 264.1
billion yen ($2.8 billion) shortfall for December in the widest
measure of the nation’s trade, compared with a forecast for a
deficit of 144.2 billion yen.  RBA Statement  “Japan’s large current account surplus was the only
remaining factor pushing the yen stronger,” said  Joseph Capurso , a currency strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, the nation’s largest lender. “Now that support has
given way, and the yen is inevitably selling off.”  Australia’s dollar is poised to drop for a fourth-straight
week against the U.S. currency as the RBA predicted “below
trend” 2013 growth. Consumer prices will rise 3 percent in the
year to June 2013, compared with the 3.25 percent increase it
had forecast three months earlier, the central bank said.  Daily declines in the Aussie were erased after China’s
customs administration said exports rose 25 percent in January
from a year earlier while imports increased 28.8 percent,
exceeding economist estimates.  Currency Volatility  The so-called Aussie added 0.1 percent to $1.0292, after
falling as much as 0.3 percent earlier. It is still poised for a
1.1 percent decline this week.  Currency volatility will probably increase this year as
volumes climb, Citigroup Inc. said, citing trading platform and
central bank figures.  Combined average daily volume on currency trading platforms
by CME Group Inc., Thomson Reuters Corp. and ICAP Plc was at
$381 billion last month, up from $290 billion in December and
$339 billion a year earlier, according to data compiled by  Greg Anderson , Citigroup’s North American head of Group-of-10
currency in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
