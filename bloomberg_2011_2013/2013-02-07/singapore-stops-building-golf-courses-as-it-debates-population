Singapore will stop building golf
courses as it ramps up public housing construction to support a
population projected to grow to as much as 6.9 million by 2030.  The government will not allocate any more space for golf
courses, which currently occupy 2 percent of the city’s land
area, according to the  Ministry of National Development .  “As our land demands increase in the coming years to
support population and economic growth, we will need to further
optimize the use of our limited land,” the ministry said in a
response to a question in Parliament. “Some of the land
currently allocated for golf course use will have to be put to
more productive uses.”  The government is planning to build almost 200,000
apartments in the next three years and extend its railway system
over the next two decades amid unhappiness over infrastructure
strains and record-high home prices. Singaporeans are planning a
protest next week against the government’s projection of an
increase of as much as 30 percent by 2030 from the current 5.3
million people on the island smaller than New York City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
