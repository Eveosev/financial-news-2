Estonian  inflation  unexpectedly
slowed to the weakest pace in 29 months in January as free
public transport in the capital outweighed increases in
electricity, alcohol and tobacco prices.  Inflation was 3.4 percent from a year earlier, compared
with 3.5 percent in December, the lowest level since August
2010, the statistics office in Tallinn said today on its
website. That’s less than the 3.8 percent median forecast from a
Bloomberg survey of four analysts. Prices rose 0.7 percent from
the previous month.  Inflation in the newest euro member will slow to 3.6
percent this year from 3.9 percent in 2012 as global food and
fuel prices decline, the central bank predicted last month.
Prices will get a temporary boost this year as households are
charged market rates for power and state-owned AS Eesti Energia
is forced to pay for carbon-emissions quotas, it said.  The  Tallinn municipality , home to almost a third of the
nation’s 1.3 million population, made public transport free for
all residents of the capital starting this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
