Blackstone Group LP , the largest
private-equity firm, agreed to buy a majority stake in 40 U.S.
shopping centers from  UBS AB  property funds in a deal valued at
about $1.1 billion, as it expands its retail holdings.  Kimco Realty Corp. , UBS’s joint-venture partner on the
properties, will increase its ownership to 33 percent from 18
percent,  David Henry , the retail landlord’s president and chief
executive officer, said yesterday on a conference call with
investors. The venture has about $692 million in debt on the
properties, according to a  filing  by New Hyde Park, New York-
based Kimco. The portfolio is 5.7 million square feet (530,000
square meters) and was 96.1 percent leased at the end of 2012.  Blackstone, based in New York, is adding retail properties
as rents and occupancies rise. Shopping-center vacancies dropped
to 10.7 percent in the fourth quarter from 10.8 percent in the
previous three months and 11 percent a year earlier, according
to New York-based data provider  Reis Inc.  Effective  rents , or
what’s paid after any landlord discounts, averaged $16.59 a
square foot, up from $16.51 a year earlier.  “Blackstone is essentially stepping into the shoes of
UBS,”  David Bujnicki , a spokesman for Kimco, said in a
telephone interview. He declined to disclose details of the
transaction.  Peter Rose , a spokesman for Blackstone, didn’t immediately
return a telephone call seeking comment on the deal.  Blackstone  in 2011 bought the U.S. shopping centers of
Australia’s Centro Properties Group for $9 billion and renamed
the company Brixmor Property Group Inc. Last year, Blackstone
formed a partnership with Beachwood, Ohio-based DDR Corp. to buy
46 U.S. centers for $1.43 billion from a unit of Tel Aviv-based
Elbit Imaging Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
