Natura Cosmeticos SA  jumped after
reporting a productivity gain in the fourth quarter and raising
dividend payments.  Shares of Latin America’s biggest cosmetics maker rose 2.1
percent to 53 reais at 1:41 p.m. in Sao Paulo, the biggest
intraday advance since Jan. 21. The benchmark Bovespa index slid
0.8 percent.  Natura’s adjusted net income fell 12 percent to 257.3
million reais ($130.3 million) in the last quarter of 2012 from
the same period one year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg after the company released results late yesterday.  “Natura’s strategy for boosting productivity in Brazil
continued to pay off, leading to a 2.9 percent increase in sales
representatives’ productivity in the domestic market,”  Ricardo Boiati ,  Alan Cardoso  and Pedro Bueno, analysts at  Banco Bradesco
SA ’s brokerage unit, wrote in a note to clients dated today.  The company also announced 488 million reais in dividends
and interest on capital, which when added to the amounts already
paid to shareholders will amount to 1.97 reais per share for
2012, the analysts wrote.  Natura said in a statement yesterday after the market
closed that it is paying investors in 2012 a total of 846
million reais, 11 percent more than in 2011. “That corresponds
to 100 percent of 2012’s net income,” the company said.  The number of the cosmetics maker’s independent sales
representatives in Brazil rose 7.9 percent to 1.268 million at
the end of the fourth quarter of last year, and earnings in the
domestic market rose 8.9 percent during the year, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
