Swiss  consumer confidence  rose to the
highest since April 2011 as households grew more positive about
the economic outlook.  An index based on a quarterly survey of about 1,200
households increased to minus 6 from minus 17 in October, the
 State Secretariat for Economic Affairs  in Bern said in an e-
mailed statement today. Economists had forecast a gain to minus
12, the median of nine estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  A gauge measuring consumers’ assessment of the economic
outlook in the next 12 months rose to zero from minus 23 in
October, while a sub-indicator of future unemployment fell to 62
from 67, indicating a decrease.  To contact the reporter on this story:
