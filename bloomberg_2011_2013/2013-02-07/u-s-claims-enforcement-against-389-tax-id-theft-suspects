The U.S. government took action in
January against 389 people suspected of committing tax fraud
through identity theft, the Internal Revenue Service said today.  The enforcement efforts, which the IRS said included 109
arrests and 189 indictments, came on the eve of the tax-filing
season that began Jan. 30 and continues through April 15. The
IRS and the Justice Department have been trying to fight an
increase in the crime over the past several years.  Criminals with access to Social Security numbers and other
identifying information file fake tax returns under other
people’s names and claim their refunds. The crime is
particularly prevalent at the beginning of the tax season
because it works only if the fake returns are filed before
legitimate taxpayers submit their own.  “We have aggressively stepped up our efforts to pursue and
prevent refund fraud and identity theft, and we will continue to
intensely focus on this area,”  Steven Miller , the acting IRS
commissioner, said in a statement. “This is part of a much
wider effort underway for the 2013 tax season to stop fraud.”  The IRS has refined computerized filters that it uses to
examine suspicious tax returns for potential fraud and prevent
refunds from being sent. The tax agency also has increased the
number of people working on identity theft to more than 3,000,
more than double the number from late 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
