Crude oil options volatility fell
with the underlying futures after European Central Bank
President Mario Draghi said the euro’s strength could hamper an
economic recovery and crimp fuel demand.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.28 percent at 3:45 p.m. on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, down from from 20.70 yesterday. Crude
oil for April delivery slipped 74 cents to $95.35 a barrel on
the Nymex.  The futures declined after Draghi said ECB policy makers
are concerned an advance in the euro, which gained 2.5 percent
this year through yesterday, could stymie a recovery by curbing
exports and damping inflation. They “want to see if the
appreciation is sustained,” he said.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts. They increased 10 cents to 76 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,666 contracts. The second-most active were March $94
puts, which gained 4 cents to 50 cents a barrel, with 1,953 lots
exchanged.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 58
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs. In the
previous session, puts accounted for 57 percent of volume.  March $85 puts were the most active traded options
yesterday, with 6,785 contracts trading as they were unchanged
at 3 cents a barrel. April $115 calls dropped 1 cent to 7 cents
barrel on 5,499 lots.  Open interest was highest for March $85 puts with 42,876
contracts. Next were March $110 calls at 40,923 and March $115
calls at 30,924.  To contact the reporter on this story:
