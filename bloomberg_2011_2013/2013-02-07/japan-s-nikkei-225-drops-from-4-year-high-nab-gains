Most Asian shares dropped on earnings
concern after Nikon Corp. and News Corp. cut forecasts and
Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  fell from a four-year high.  Nikon plunged the most since 1985 as the Japanese camera
maker reduced its profit forecast on slowing demand in Europe.
Rupert Murdoch’s  News Corp.  lost 3.2 percent in Sydney after
cutting its earnings outlook on declining ratings for shows such
as “American Idol” and “X Factor.” Kubota Corp. lost 3.8
percent, among the biggest drops on the Nikkei 225, as net
income at the Japanese tractor maker missed analysts’ estimates.
 National Australia Bank  gained 1.9 percent as the lender
reported a rise in first-quarter profit.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  slid 0.3 percent to 132.84 as
of 8:10 p.m. in Tokyo, with about five shares falling for every
four that rose. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.9 percent, retreating
from yesterday’s highest closing level September 2008, the month
that Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed.  “We’re in for a pullback in the near term,” said  Hans Goetti , Singapore-based chief investment officer for Asia at
Finaport Investment Intelligence, which manages the equivalent
of $1.5 billion. He spoke in a Bloomberg Television interview.
“The market is overbought and positive sentiment is off the
charts, which is a contrarian indicator.”  The benchmark regional equities gauge gained 8.9 percent in
the three months through yesterday, led by Japanese shares as
Prime Minister  Shinzo Abe ’s campaign for aggressive monetary
policy easing weakened the yen, boosting the earnings outlook
for exporters.  Australian Jobs  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.3 percent after the
nation’s employers boosted payrolls more than economists
forecast in January. The number of people employed rose by
10,400 from December, when it fell a revised 3,800, a smaller
decrease than previously reported, the statistics bureau said in
Sydney today.  The BSE India Sensitive Index slid 0.3 percent after the
government forecast the weakest economic growth in a decade.
Gross domestic product will rise 5 percent in the 12 months
through March 2013, below last year’s 6.2 percent and the least
since 4 percent in 2002-2003, the statistics bureau reported
today.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index slid 0.3 percent, while the
Shanghai Composite Index sank 0.7 percent and Singapore’s
Straits Times Index lost 0.5 percent. South Korea’s Kospi Index
sank 0.2 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.3
percent today. The gauge rose 0.1 percent yesterday as better-
than-estimated earnings overshadowed concern over Europe’s debt
crisis before a gathering of euro-area leaders.  Sony’s Loss  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark Asian equities
gauge, traded at 14.8 times average estimated earnings compared
with 13.7 for the S&P 500 and 12.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sony Corp., reporting results after the close of markets in
Tokyo, unexpectedly posted an eighth consecutive quarterly loss
on waning demand for TVs and consumer preferences for Apple Inc.
and Samsung Electronics Co. devices. The shares gained 2.6
percent to 1,519 yen before the announcement.  Nikon tumbled 19 percent to 2,139 yen. Net income will
probably be 38 billion yen ($407 million) in the year ending
March, compared with a previous forecast of 60 billion yen, the
Tokyo-based company said yesterday in a statement. Prices of
entry-level single-lens reflex cameras have tumbled because of
slowing demand and rising competition, it said.  TV Ratings  News Corp. lost 3.2 percent to A$26.60, the biggest decline
since June. A slump in TV ratings puts a damper on Murdoch’s
plans to split his company in two, cleaving the declining
publishing division from his more profitable entertainment
businesses.  Kubota sank 3.8 percent to 1,071 yen. The maker of farm
equipment raised its full-year operating profit forecast 1.9
percent to 107 billion yen, less than the 112.1 billion average
estimate by 19 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  NAB gained 1.9 percent to A$28.63. The increase in first-
quarter profit comes as Chief Executive Officer Cameron Clyne is
trying to revive earnings growth after provisions at the bank’s
U.K. unit led last fiscal year to the first decline in annual
profit since 2009.  Mazda Motor Corp. surged 12 percent to 317 yen after the
carmaker raised its projected operating profit by 80 percent,
citing a weaker yen.  Of the 255 firms on the MSCI Asia Pacific index that have
reported  earnings  so far this quarter and for which Bloomberg
has estimates, 53 percent have exceeded profit expectations.
Some 53 percent have missed sales projections, the data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Tom DeMark, the creator of indicators to show turning
points in securities, said the Shanghai Composite Index will
retreat about 8 percent before resuming gains as a surge in
Chinese stocks has exhausted buyers. The gauge of domestic
Chinese equities climbed 24 percent through yesterday from an
almost four-year low in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
