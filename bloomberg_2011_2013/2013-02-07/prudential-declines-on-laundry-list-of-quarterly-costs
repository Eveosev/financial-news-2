Prudential Financial Inc. , the
second-biggest U.S. life insurer, fell the most among the
largest financial firms after reporting a loss on costs tied to
currency fluctuations.  Prudential slid 4 percent to $56.16 at 11:06 a.m. in New
York, the steepest drop on the 81-company Standard & Poor’s 500
Financials Index.  The fourth-quarter loss was $232 million, Newark, New
Jersey-based Prudential said yesterday, as a slide in the yen
against the dollar contributed to a $1.5 billion pretax cost
tied to foreign exchange. Operating profit, which excludes some
investments and the results of policies sold before the firm
went public, fell short of  analysts’ estimates .  “The stock is likely to pull back some, given noisy
results,”  John Nadel , an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach Inc.,
wrote in a research note. “No quarter for PRU would be complete
without a laundry list of unusual items and 4Q was no
different.”  Prudential recorded charges related to acquisitions and had
a $20 million cost to increase legal reserves in the group
insurance segment. It booked $69 million of costs tied to an
increase in employee benefits liabilities and a write-off of
expenses related to debt issuance.  MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. life insurer, fell 2.2
percent to $36.73. The New York-based insurer is scheduled to
report results Feb. 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
