The lack of definitive biological
markers for the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease has made
it impossible to enroll patients in drug-research trials, U.S.
regulators said, slowing development of new treatments.  The methods for trials were established in 1984 and cover
patients with full-blown dementia who suffer both cognitive and
functional limitations, the Food and Drug Administration said in
a  statement  today. The agency is  proposing  to relax guidelines
for early-stage Alzheimer’s drug trials by letting researchers
show that a medication slows the cognitive decline, rather than
improvement in both cognitive and functional deterioration.  People in the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s don’t always
have functional limitations such as problems getting dressed,
bathing and taking care of their own daily needs. For this group
of people, showing that a medication slows the cognitive decline
may be enough to win regulatory approval, the FDA said.  After an approval, companies would have to conduct larger,
longer studies to show the improvement in mental function
translates into improved health, the FDA said.  The draft document is subject to a 60-day comment period
and could change based upon the input the FDA receives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
