Coffee futures slumped to the lowest
in almost 32 months on mounting concern that global demand will
trail supplies boosted by jumbo crops in Brazil and Colombia.  Plants in Brazil, the world’s top grower, will get
beneficial rain this week, Sao Paulo-based Somar Meteorologia
said. During the low-yielding cycle of the biennial crop, the
harvest will approach last year’s all-time high, the government
has said. In 2013, output in Colombia, the second-biggest
arabica producer, will jump 30 percent from a year earlier, an
industry group said today.  “Bears keep noting that there is more than enough
coffee,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price Futures Group
in Chicago, said in a report. “Current crop development is good
this year in Brazil,” and “Colombia is reported to have good
conditions,” he said.  Arabica coffee for March delivery slid 1.3 percent to
settle at $1.403 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Earlier, the price touched $1.3965, the lowest for a most-
active contract since June 11, 2010. Volume was more than double
the average for the past 100 days, data tracked by Bloomberg
showed.  Inventory  monitored by ICE has climbed to the highest since
March 2010. In 12 months, the price has dropped 37 percent, the
most among 24  raw materials  in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index.  Producers Selling  “Producers are selling, trying to secure a better income
in case prices continue to drop,”  Hernando de la Roche , a
senior vice president for INTL FCStone in Miami, said in a
telephone interview.  Arabica is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed by
specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly in Asia and parts
of Africa.  On NSYE Liffe in London, robusta futures for March delivery
rose 1.4 percent to $2,098 a metric ton (95 cents a pound).
Earlier, the price reached $2,109, the highest since Oct. 11.  The price has climbed 13 percent in the past 12 months as
roasters and consumers favored the cheaper beans, partly because
of the fragile global economy. Nestle SA is the global leader in
the instant coffee market.  Colombia’s output will rise to 10 million bags this year
from 7.7 million in 2012,  Luis Genaro Munoz , the head of the
National Federation of Coffee Growers, said in a telephone
interview from Bogota.  ICE inventory has jumped 72 percent to 2.64 million bags in
the past 12 months. A bag weighs 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
