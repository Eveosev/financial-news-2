U.S. East Coast gasoline weakened to
a nine-month low against futures on speculation that the flow of
cargoes carrying fuel from Europe to the U.S. will rise and as a
Pennsylvania refinery unit restarted.  About 28 tankers were probably chartered to load gasoline
in the two weeks to Feb. 20, the highest number of bookings
since Nov. 21, according to the median estimate in a survey of
eight shipbrokers and traders specializing in the market.  Delta Air Lines Inc. ’s Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery is
restarting a catalytic cracker after shutting in December to
address issues with a slurry oil circuit, according to  Trebor Banstetter , a company spokesman in Atlanta. The restart, coupled
with increased cargoes, may boost  gasoline supplies  on the East
Coast, where stockpiles climbed to 58.1 million barrels last
week, Energy Information Administration data show.  Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in the New York
Harbor slumped  2.62 cents  to trade at a discount of 4.25 cents
versus futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:25 p.m.
That’s the widest gap since April 13 and a third consecutive
decline.  Prompt delivery  slipped 6.61 cents to $2.9574 a gallon.  “The slew of cargoes will give New York a boost in imports
over the next few weeks,” Thomas Finlon, a director for Energy
Analytics Group Ltd. in Jupiter, Florida, said in a phone
interview. “You’ll also end up with some gasoline from the
Delta refinery.”  East Coast  imports  of gasoline increased 57,000 barrels a
day to 666,000 in the week ended Feb. 1, the highest level since
Sept. 7, EIA data showed.  Gulf Coast  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, based on Brent oil in
Europe, dropped $1.732 to $11.5951 a barrel. The 3-2-1 spread on
the  U.S. Gulf Coast , measured using West Texas Intermediate in
Cushing, rose 54.2 cents to $27.142. The same spread for Light
Louisiana Sweet Oil dropped 1.4 cents to $6.9818 a barrel.  Conventional,  87-octane gasoline  on the U.S. Gulf Coast
rose 4.13 cents to trade 17.25 cents below futures, a second
consecutive gain. Reformulated gasoline to be blended with
ethanol strengthened 3.5 cents to  12.25 cents  below futures.  Supplies in the region slipped 1.61 million barrels to 80.5
million last week, a third consecutive weekly decline, according
to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
