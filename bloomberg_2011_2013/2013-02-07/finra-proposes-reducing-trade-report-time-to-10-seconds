The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority is seeking a rule change that would require brokerages
to report  trades  within 10 seconds rather than 30.  The rule would apply to all equity transactions, including
companies not listed on an exchange, and order cancellations,
Finra said in a Feb. 1  filing  to the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. The change will help ensure that trade data
reflects the current  market , according to Finraâ€™s proposal.  Finra also strengthened language to prohibit delays in
reporting and said brokers should program systems to report
executions as soon as possible. More than 99 percent of
transactions executed by brokers away from the exchanges already
report within 10 seconds, said the group that oversees 4,300
brokerages.  Only 22 companies in a one-week period were unable to
report to Finra at least half of their eligible transactions
within 10 seconds, it said. The majority of those firms route
most of their trades to other brokers or do not handle equities
frequently, Finra said.  If the SEC approves the change, it would take effect 120 to
180 days later, according to the filing. Finra will look for a
pattern of late reporting before taking action against a
brokerage, the filing said. It will also take into consideration
exceptional circumstances such as system failure and unusual
market conditions, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
