The Czech Republic is prepared to
veto a promised European Union investment budget for 2014-2020
because it considers the spending plan to be unfair, Prime
Minister  Petr Necas  said.  “The proposal is unacceptable to us and we’re prepared to
veto it,” he told reporters today in Brussels. “The proposal
isn’t fair.”  EU spending on cross-border transport, energy and research
projects was chopped in a first round of talks in November and
faces further cuts when leaders meet today in Brussels to set
the 27-nation bloc’s budget for 2014-2020. The proposal has yet
to be officially distributed to national delegations.  A July 2012 European Commission proposal for a seven-year
package of 1.047 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion) was shaved to
973 billion euros in November. The wealthier countries that
provide the financing want to shear off another 20 billion
euros. The seven-year budget expiring this year totaled 994
billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
