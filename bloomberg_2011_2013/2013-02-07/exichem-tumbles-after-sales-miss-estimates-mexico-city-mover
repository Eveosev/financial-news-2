Mexichem SA , Latin America’s biggest
plastic-pipe maker, plunged the most in sixteen months after the
company reported preliminary sales for 2012 that fell short of
analysts’ estimates.  The stock sank 5.9 percent to 65.91 pesos at the close of
Mexico City trading, the steepest drop since September 2011. The
shares had tumbled 2.8 percent  yesterday , in a decline that came
mostly in the last hour of trading after the preliminary fourth-
quarter earnings report was posted on the Mexican stock
exchange’s website.  Mexichem, based in Tlalnepantla, had 2012 sales of 63.4
billion pesos ($5 billion), the company said in a statement.
That compared with the average estimate of 67.7 billion pesos in
a Bloomberg survey of  nine analysts . Earnings before interest,
taxes depreciation and amortization totaled 13.3 billion pesos,
the company said, compared with the average analyst estimate of
14.4 billion pesos.  The results should be “negative for the shares,” Credit
Suisse Group AG analysts led by  Vanessa Quiroga  wrote in an e-
mail today to clients. The company’s report gave few details on
one-time costs in the quarter, the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
