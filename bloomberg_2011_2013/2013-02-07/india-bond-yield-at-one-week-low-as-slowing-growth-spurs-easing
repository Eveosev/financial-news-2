India’s benchmark 10-year bond yield
touched a one-week low on speculation the slowest economic
growth in almost a decade will prompt the central bank to
further ease monetary policy.  Asia’s third-largest  economy  will expand 5 percent in the
fiscal year ending March 31, compared with 6.2 percent in the
prior 12 months, the Central Statistical Office said today. The
Reserve Bank of India cut its benchmark repurchase rate on Jan.
29 for the first time since April.  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell
three basis points to 7.88 percent, according to the central
bank’s trading system.  “Given slowing growth and monetary easing, we suggest
investors stay strategically long on bonds,” said Vivek Rajpal,
a fixed-income strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Mumbai.
Nomura predicts the 10-year yield will drop to 7.80 percent by
the end of March. The central bank may again cut interest rates
in May, he said.  The RBI reduced the repurchase  rate  last week to 7.75
percent from 8 percent. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao cut the cash
reserve ratio to 4 percent from 4.25 percent, effective Feb. 9,
injecting 180 billion rupees ($3.35 billion) into the banking
system.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell one basis
point to 7.63 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
