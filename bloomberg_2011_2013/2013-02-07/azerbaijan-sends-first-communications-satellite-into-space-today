Azerbaijan will launch its first
communications satellite today, designed and built by  Orbital
Sciences Corp ., as the Caspian Sea nation seeks to develop
information technology to diversify its economy beyond energy.  The Azerspace/Africasat-1a satellite will provide
communications services to Azerbaijan, Central Asia, Europe and
Africa, the Dulles, Virginia-based company said on its  website .
Orbital is responsible for providing the satellite and ground
system, it said.  The third largest oil-producer in the former Soviet Union
will order a second satellite within two years of the first
launch, Deputy Communications and Information Technology
Minister Elmir Valizada said in a May 2011 interview. President
 Ilham Aliyev  ordered his government to double the non-oil
economy in the next decade as crude production declined for a
second year in 2012.  The former Soviet republicâ€™s Communications and Information
Technology Ministry ordered the satellite in June 2010, under a
contract worth $205 million, according to the Azeri  embassy  in
Washington. It will transmit from an orbital location at 46
degrees east longitude, Orbital said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
