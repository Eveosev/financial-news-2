Impresa SGPS SA , Portugal’s biggest
media company, wants  Google Inc.  to start paying for listing its
headlines and snippets of articles in search engines results.  “This assault has to stop,” said  Francisco Balsemao ,
chairman of Lisbon-based Impresa. “The principle we must fight
for is that we must be paid for our content,” he said in an e-
mailed response to questions.  Google “has nothing to comment about personal opinions,”
Marisa Toro, a spokeswoman for the Mountain View, California-
based company, said by e-mail.  Google announced on Feb. 1 that it would create a 60
million-euro ($81 million) fund to help French newspaper and
magazine publishers develop their Internet presence. That
follows the French government’s threat to propose a law that
would have required news aggregators to pay royalties to
publishers for linking their content.  Impresa, which owns Portugal’s top-selling weekly newspaper
Expresso, and Visao, one of the country’s leading news
magazines, is in talks with other media companies in Portugal
about how to proceed in terms of seeking compensation from
Google, said Balsemao.  “For me, a good agreement is preferable to a lawsuit,” he
said, adding that the 60 million euros Google will invest in the
French fund is a “derisory sum.”  “Everything indicates that Google continues to refuse to
pay for the indexed content and that aspect does not seem
positive,” said Balsemao.  To contact the reporter on this story:
