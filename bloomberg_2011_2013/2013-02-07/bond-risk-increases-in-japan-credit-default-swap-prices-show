  The cost of insuring corporate
bonds in Japan against non-payment rose, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index climbed one basis point to
126 basis points as of 9:09 a.m. in Tokyo, according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The measure is on track to fall by nine
basis points since Jan. 31, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan was little changed at 115 basis points
as of 8:21 a.m. in Hong Kong, Standard Chartered Plc prices
show. The gauge is headed for its lowest close this week,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was also little changed
at 120 basis points as of 11:09 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The benchmark, which started the year at
127.5, has fallen for five straight months to January, according
to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
