Japan’s two-year notes advanced,
pushing yields to the lowest in more than a decade, amid
speculation the central bank will expand monetary easing after a
new governor is appointed.  Rates on five-year notes matched  levels  unseen since the
Ministry of Finance started issuing the debt in February 2000,
after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa announced on Feb.
5 that he will step down on March 19, almost three weeks before
his term is due to end. Benchmark 10-year debt advanced for a
third day as stocks in Tokyo declined, increasing demand for the
relative safety of government securities.  “Two- and five-year notes are leading the market with
their strength,” said  Takafumi Yamawaki , Tokyo-based chief
rates strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the 24 primary
dealers obliged to bid at Japan’s debt sales. “There are
expectations for monetary easing by the Bank of Japan.”  The yield on the two-year note fell 1 1/2 basis points to
0.03 percent as of 11 a.m. in Tokyo from yesterday, according to
Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The price of the 0.1 percent security maturing in
February 2015 advanced 0.03 yen to 100.139. It was the lowest
yield for a two-year note since September 2002. Five-year rates
dropped a 1/2 basis point to 0.14 percent.  Benchmark 10-year rates  declined  1 1/2 basis points to 0.76
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for March delivery gained 0.13 to
144.14 in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average of shares fell 0.6
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
