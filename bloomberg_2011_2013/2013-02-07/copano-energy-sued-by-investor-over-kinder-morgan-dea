Copano Energy LLC , the natural gas
processor being bought by  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP , was
sued by an investor who contends stockholders will be
shortchanged in the proposed $5 billion takeover.  Copano agreed Jan. 29 to the purchase by Kinder Morgan for
about $3.2 billion in stock, plus additional debt, valuing
Copano shares at $40.91 each at the time and giving Kinder more
access to gas-producing shale basins in Texas and Oklahoma.  “The consideration offered to Copano’s public shareholders
in the proposed transaction is unfair and inadequate,”
considering “the intrinsic value” of the shares in light of
future prospects, Irwin Berlin, with more than 3,000 shares,
said in a Delaware Chancery Court suit made public today.  Berlin asked the court to stop the buyout, award group or
class-action status and assess unspecified damages. As it
stands, Copano investors would receive 0.4563 Kinder Morgan
share for each of their shares, according to court papers.  Both companies are based in Houston.  Larry Pierce , a spokesman for Kinder Morgan, declined to
comment on the lawsuit in an e-mail.  Carl Luna , Copano’s vice
president for investor relations, didn’t immediately respond to
phone messages seeking comment.  The case is Berlin v. Copano, CA8284, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
