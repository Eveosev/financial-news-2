BlackBerry, which is rolling out its
BlackBerry 10 lineup over the coming months, won’t be releasing
the flagship Z10 phone in Japan, where the company doesn’t have
much of a fan base.  “Japan is not a major market for BlackBerry and we have no
plans to launch BlackBerry 10 devices there at this time,” Amy
McDowell, a spokeswoman for the Waterloo, Ontario-based company,
said today in an e-mail. “However, we will continue to support
BlackBerry customers in Japan.”  The move means BlackBerry won’t be competing in the future
in one of the world’s largest markets for phones. An  estimated 
15 million mobile devices were sold in the country last quarter,
including smartphones, portable computers and tablets, according
to IDC. The Z10 is currently available in the U.K. and Canada,
with plans to release it in the U.S. next month.  Nikkei previously reported on BlackBerry’s plan to stop
offering new phones in the country, saying the company’s local
market share had shrunk to 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
