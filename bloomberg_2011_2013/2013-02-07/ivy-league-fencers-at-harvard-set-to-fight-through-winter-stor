The Ivy League said its fencing
championships are still scheduled to be held at Harvard
University this weekend, when a winter storm is projected to
dump as much as two feet of snow on the Boston area.  The two-day Fencing Round-Robins, at which Princeton
University will seek to retain the  men’s and women’s titles ,
will be held Feb. 9-10 with round-robin competition at
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Harvard’s Gordon Track, the
league said in a  statement .  The National Weather Service in Taunton, Massachusetts,
said there is a blizzard watch in effect for the Boston region
from tomorrow morning through Feb. 9. There may be 18 to 24
inches of accumulation, with snowfall rates of two to three
inches per hour possible, the weather service said on its
 website .  “As of right now, it’s still on,” Ivy League spokesman
Trevor Rutledge-Leverenz said of the fencing championships in a
phone interview. “We’re keeping an eye on the storm like
everybody. We might get three inches, we might get three feet.
We don’t really know.”  The Ivy League said any changes to its sports schedule
would be made on its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
