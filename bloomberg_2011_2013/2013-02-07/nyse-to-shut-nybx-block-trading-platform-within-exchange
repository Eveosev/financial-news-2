The New York Stock Exchange told
regulators it plans to shut a block-trading service within the
Big Board because of insufficient interest.  NYBX , or New York Block Exchange, will be closed Feb. 28,
the company said in a  filing  to the Securities and Exchange
Commission dated Feb. 5. It began operations in January 2009.
The exchange facility enables orders submitted to NYBX that
aren’t publicly displayed to trade with those at the Big Board.  The exchange operates NYBX through a joint venture with
Bids Holdings LP, a consortium of 12 broker-dealers,  NYSE
Euronext  said in a regulatory filing in February 2012. While
both groups co-own NYBX, a NYSE subsidiary owns less than 10
percent of the total limited partnership interest in Bids, NYSE
said in a November  filing .  “The exchange is ceasing operations of NYBX facility
because after years of operations the facility has not garnered
enough volume to achieve critical mass and does not have strong
support customers,” the exchange said in the filing. Block
trades are usually transactions of at least 10,000 shares.  The  Bids  alternative trading system, or dark pool, is
separate from NYBX. It traded 28.6 million shares in December,
according to data compiled by Rosenblatt Securities Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
