Ireland’s five-year note yields fell
to the lowest in more than seven years after the nation won an
agreement to restructure the costs of rescuing the former Anglo
Irish Bank Corp.  Under the plan, dubbed ‘Project Red,’ Ireland will swap so
called promissory notes used to rescue the failed lender with
long-term bonds with maturities of up to 40 years. The accord
will ease the nation’s borrowing needs over the next decade by
20 billion euros ($26.8 billion).  Irish officials have been trying to reach a deal with the
European Central Bank for the past 1 1/2 years over the issue,
which has dogged the country’s attempts to work its way out of
an international aid package.  The accord increases “the probability that the sovereign
will be in a position to regain full market access and exit the
bailout successfully at the end of the year,” said Juliet
Tennent, an economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin, in a
note today.  Ireland’s  five-year note yield  fell as much as 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 2.80 percent, the lowest
since October 2005. It was at 2.82 percent as of 11:24 a.m.
London time.  The government had been due to give Anglo Irish 3.1 billion
euros a year for at least the next decade to pay down a central
bank loan. Now, the first capital payment is due in 2038 and the
last in payment will be made in 2053.  “We have replaced a short-term, high interest rate
overdraft that had to be paid down quickly through more
expensive borrowings, with long-term, cheap, interest-only
loans,” Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
