Russia’s winter grains may have
escaped some damage forecast by the government because of warm
weather in southern areas last month, the Institute for
Agricultural Market Studies, known as Ikar, said.  Damage may cover 1.2 million hectares (about 3 million
acres) to 1.3 million hectares,  Oleg Sukhanov , Ikar analyst,
said by phone from Moscow today. That equals 7.6 percent to 8.2
percent of plantings. The government estimated 9.5 percent of
losses from 15.8 million hectares of plantings.  “Plantings are germinating better in the south,” Sukhanov
said. Ikar estimated the new grain crop will be 85 million to 92
million metric tons, up from 70.7 million tons harvested this
season.  Russia is expected to be the fifth-biggest  wheat exporter 
this season after the U.S., Canada, the European Union and
Australia, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. Wheat
for March delivery dropped 0.3 percent to $7.5925 a bushel on
the Chicago Board of Trade by 5:26 p.m. Moscow time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
