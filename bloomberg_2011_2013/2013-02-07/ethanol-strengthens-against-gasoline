Ethanol strengthened against gasoline
on speculation that falling stockpiles will help reduce a glut
of the biofuel and buoy prices.  The spread narrowed 1.88 cents to 59.19 cents a gallon as
gasoline slipped more than ethanol, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Stockpiles  of the biofuel fell 2.2 percent to 20.1 million
barrels, the biggest drop in six weeks, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
yesterday.  “By mid-first quarter we tend to see the prices narrow,”
said  Terry Reilly , senior commodity analyst at Futures
International LLC in Chicago. “The tighter stocks in ethanol
will rally futures for the next three months.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 2.1 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $2.408 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Gasoline for March delivery fell 3.98 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $2.9999 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline made to be
blended with the biofuel.  Stockpiles of ethanol in the week ended Feb. 1 were 4.6
percent lower than a year ago, government data showed. Ethanol-
blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the total U.S. gasoline
pool last week, up from 87 percent the previous week.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs,
rose 2 percent to 51 cents for  advanced forms  of ethanol, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Each gallon of ethanol is assigned a
RIN, which helps the government track whether refiners are
meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  “Ethanol and RINs should move in tandem,” Reilly said.  U.S. refiners are to use 13.8 billion gallons of renewable
fuels, such as ethanol, this year and 15 billion by 2015.  Corn Prices  Corn for March delivery declined for a fifth day, falling
11.75 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $7.1075 a bushel in Chicago. One
bushel makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, narrowed to minus 18
cents from minus 20 cents the previous day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  In cash market trading, ethanol slid 0.5 cent to $2.405 a
gallon in Chicago, 1 cent to $2.51 in New York and 1.5 cents to
$2.56 on the West Coast, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Spot ethanol fell 2 cents to $2.435 in the U.S. Gulf,
a third daily drop.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo , where ethanol is made from
sugarcane, cost $2.21 a gallon in the week ended Feb. 1, data
compiled by Bloomberg show, or 8.3 percent less than today’s
U.S. futures price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
