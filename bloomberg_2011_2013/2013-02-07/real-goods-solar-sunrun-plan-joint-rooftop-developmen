Real Goods Solar Inc. , a Colorado-
based installer of solar power systems, agreed to jointly
develop residential projects with Sunrun Inc. in four states.  Real Goods will design and build rooftop solar systems that
Sunrun will own and operate through their customer leasing
program, the company said in a statement today. The partnership
will focus on solar markets in California, Colorado, New York
and Massachusetts.  Real Goods, based in Louisville, Colorado, fell 5 percent
to $1.04 at the close in New York. The shares have gained 37
percent this year.  Closely held Sunrun is based in San Francisco and has
raised $145 million in venture capital to support its leasing
program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
