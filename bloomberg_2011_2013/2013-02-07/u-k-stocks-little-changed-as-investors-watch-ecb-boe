U.K. stocks were little changed
before the European Central Bank details its latest policy
decisions and lawmakers question Mark Carney on his agenda as
the next Bank of England governor.  The FTSE 100 rose 6.81 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,302.15
at 8:35 a.m. in London. The equity benchmark has gained 6.9
percent in 2013, its best start to a year since 1998, as U.S.
lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget. The broader FTSE All-
Share Index also added 0.1 percent today, while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ
Index advanced 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
