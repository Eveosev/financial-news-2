Commerzbank AG , Germany’s second-
biggest bank, had its rating put on review for a possible
downgrade at Standard & Poor’s after the lender said it will
post a fourth-quarter loss of 720 million euros ($970 million)
on writedowns.  Standard & Poor’s will complete the review of Commerzbank’s
long-term rating of ‘A’ within three months, once it receives
more details about updated business and risk plans, analyst  Harm Semder  said in an e-mailed statement from Frankfurt today.  “We now believe Commerzbank’s process of re-balancing its
business model may be more complex and more time-consuming than
we previously assumed and that it may take longer to generate
stronger and sustainable earnings,” Semder said.  Commerzbank, which is restructuring its consumer banking
unit and exiting shipping and real estate funding, announced
plans last month to cut as many as 6,000 jobs over the next four
years to achieve an after tax return on equity of more than 10
percent at the core bank.  The company dropped 1.6 percent to 1.462 euros at 4:16 p.m.
in Frankfurt, heading for the eighth day of declines, the
longest losing streak in more than 18 months.  While the loss in the fourth quarter stemmed mainly from
“one-time charges due to depreciation on deferred tax
accruals,” Standard & Poor’s “believes that this loss also
indicated that Commerzbank will generate far weaker profits in
the future,” he said.  Commerzbank reported the quarterly loss, its largest in
three years, three days ago after taking charges related to the
sale of a unit and a tax asset writedown.  To contact the reporter on this story:
