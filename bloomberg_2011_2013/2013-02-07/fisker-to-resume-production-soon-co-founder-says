Fisker Automotive Inc., the maker of
plug-in luxury sports cars, will resume production “fairly
soon,” the company’s co-founder said.  Henrik Fisker , executive chairman and former chief
executive officer, declined to specify a date for resumption. He
commented to reporters yesterday following a speech at the
Chicago Auto Show.  Fisker, maker of the $103,000 rechargeable Karma sedan, is
struggling because battery supplier A123 Systems Inc. filed for
bankruptcy in October, halting Karma production. Fisker late
last year hired Evercore Partners Inc. to find potential
investors or partners as the Anaheim, California-based carmaker
looks to raise more money and resume production.  Wanxiang Group Co.  in January won approval from the
Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to buy most of
A123’s assets. Wanxiang said last month it wants to support
Fisker.  “We are negotiating with them,” Henrik Fisker said of
Wanxiang and A123 regarding when Fisker can again receive
batteries. The executive also declined to comment in detail
about the search for new investors.  “We have several interested parties,” he said.  Closely held Fisker suspended work in a Delaware plant last
year when the Energy Department halted access to a portion of a
federal loan because of failure to meet initial sales and
production goals for the Karma.  Henrik Fisker yielded the CEO post in February 2012 to  Tom Lasorda , a past president of the predecessor of Chrysler Group
LLC.  Tony Posawatz , a former General Motors Co. executive, took
over as CEO in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
