European electricity for March
delivery dropped amid forecasts that temperatures will increase
this month.  Baseload German March electricity, for supplies delivered
around the clock, fell as much as 2.1 percent while its French
equivalent declined 1.8 percent, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg.  German power for March dropped as much as 80 cents to 38.10
euros a megawatt-hour, its lowest since the contract started
trading Oct. 19. It was 38.40 euros a megawatt-hour as of 5:38
p.m. in Berlin.  Minimum temperatures in Berlin will rise to -1 degrees
Celsius (30 Fahrenheit) on average by Feb. 18 from -5 degrees on
Feb. 11, according to the  WeatherOnline  website.  “With rising temperatures, German power for March delivery
could fall another 1.5 euros a megawatt-hour, especially if
carbon and coal drop again,”  Thomas Randel , a power trader at
 EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG , Germany’s third-biggest
utility, said by phone from Karlsruhe.  German baseload power for 2014, a European benchmark, was
unchanged at 41.65 euros.  Planned maintenance of the German nuclear power plant
Philippsburg 2 will last one day longer this year, EnBW said on
its  website  today. Maintenance of the 1,458-megawatt unit will
now take place from May 4 to June 9. It was previously due to
end June 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
