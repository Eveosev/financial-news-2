Donald Yacktman , whose $21 billion
mutual-fund firm was BlackBerry’s fifth-largest investor last
year, sold almost half his holdings in the smartphone maker in
the weeks before the debut of its ballyhooed BlackBerry 10.  Yacktman Asset Management Co. sold 11.4 million BlackBerry
in the quarter ended Dec. 31, according to  data compiled by
Bloomberg , cutting its stake to 12.1 million shares. The move
followed a period of aggressive buying during the previous
quarter, when the firm “backed up the truck” to buy the stock
on the cheap, Yacktman said in an interview.  That let him take advantage of a rally for the shares,
which surged 58 percent in the fourth quarter. Still, Yacktman
sold before an additional 38 percent gain this year, fueled by
optimism that the BlackBerry 10 lineup will be a hit.
BlackBerry, formerly known as  Research In Motion Ltd ., is
counting on the new phones to pull it out of a sales slump and
win back market share lost to the iPhone and Android devices.  “The dilemma in a company like this is that there are vast
differences in outcome potential,” Yacktman said. Today, the
stock is more expensive, with no guarantee the new phones can
turn the company around, he said. “The stock is in a lot
different situation at a much higher price.”  Stock Picking  Yacktman relies more than peers on picking individual
stocks rather than indexes, a strategy that helped his firm
outperform other mutual funds during the economic slump. The
$8.1 billion  Yacktman Focused Fund  has returned 14 percent over
the past five years, putting it in the top 1 percent of
comparable funds, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  BlackBerry unveiled the BlackBerry 10 phones at an event on
Jan. 30 and has since began selling the Z10 model in the U.K.
and Canada. Buoyed by positive reviews, the phone has garnered
more initial sales in those countries than any previous model.  Still, the device has yet to arrive in the U.S.,
BlackBerry’s biggest single market. The Z10 is due to go on sale
there in March.  With his smaller stake, Yacktman became the company’s nine-
largest holder.  BlackBerry shares  rose 5.7 percent to $16.96 at
the close in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
