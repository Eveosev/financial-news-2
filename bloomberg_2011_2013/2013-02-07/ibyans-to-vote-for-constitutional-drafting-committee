Libyans will directly elect a
committee to write the country’s new constitution, lawmakers
said, reversing a decision requiring parliament to carry out the
task.  The decision by the 200-strong General National Congress
was taken in a vote in late yesterday in Tripoli, its spokesman,
Omar Hmaidan, said in a telephone interview. A total of 87 of
the 97 lawmakers present voted in favor of the move, he said.  Hassan El Amin, an independent lawmaker from the western
city of Misrata, said politicians had to pay attention to public
opinion, which has been critical of the government’s
performance. “It is obvious people wanted elections,” he said.
“There’s a lack of confidence in the National Congress.”  No date for elections was announced. “It will take some
months,” El Amin said.  Under the so-called road-map for Libya’s transition to a
modern state, the country was meant to have a new constitution
within 330 days of the end of the revolution that ousted the
late Muammar Qaddafi in Oct. 2011, paving the way for elections
in the spring of 2013. The process has been beset by delays,
hampering the foreign investment needed for reconstruction and
economic development.  “This decision is an important milestone, paving the way
for continued progress toward a constitution that reflects the
needs, priorities, and aspirations of the Libyan people,” said
Tarek Mitri, the United Nations Secretary-General’s special
representative and head of the UN Support Mission in Libya, said
in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
