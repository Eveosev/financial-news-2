TUI Travel Plc  said it’s working on
contingency plans in case the grounding of  Boeing Co .’s 787
Dreamliner persists, with the U.K. tour operator scheduled to
start holiday flights using the aircraft from May 1.  “The Dreamliner is absolutely the right airplane for us,”
Chief Executive Officer  Peter Long  said on a conference call
with journalists today after TUI Travel announced earnings. The
company has no intention to cancel its 13 plane orders, he said.  TUI Travel’s Thomson Airways Ltd. is the first U.K. company
scheduled to receive the Dreamliner, which so far is operated in
Europe only by LOT Polish Airlines SA. All 50 Dreamliners in
service around the world have been grounded since Jan. 16 after
an All Nippon Airways Co. 787 made an emergency landing after
one of its lithium-ion batteries emitted smoke.  Long didn’t say how TUI Travel may absorb the flights
scheduled on the Dreamliner. The company plans to operate the
aircraft on international routes from Manchester, London
Gatwick, Glasgow and East Midlands airports to destinations
including Florida, Mexico, Barbados, Cuba, Kenya and Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
