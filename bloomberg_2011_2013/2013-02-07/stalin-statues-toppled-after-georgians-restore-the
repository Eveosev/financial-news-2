Two statues to  Josef Stalin  were
toppled and spray-painted in Georgia after villages in the Black
Sea nation where he was born restored them to commemorate the
Soviet dictator’s birthday.  The monuments, located in the villages of Akura and Alvani
in the Kakheti region east of the capital, Tbilisi, were pushed
from their stands by unknown perpetrators, Public Broadcaster
television reported today, citing local residents. One was
painted pink, it said.  Georgia’s parliament voted to ban Soviet symbols in 2011,
20 years after the country declared independence from the Soviet
Union. The two statues were restored to mark Stalin’s Dec. 18
birthday, with another planned in his hometown of Gori, which
removed a monument to him in 2010.  Georgian President  Mikheil Saakashvili  denounced statues of
the World War II leader as a reminder of the Soviet Union’s
control of Georgia. Saakashvili’s party was unexpectedly
defeated by billionaire  Bidzina Ivanishvili ’s opposition
coalition in October. Ivanishvili has expressed a willingness to
improve ties with Russia after a five-day war in 2008 over the
breakaway region of South Ossetia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
