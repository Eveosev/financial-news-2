Gregg Williams was reinstated by the
National Football League from an indefinite suspension in the
New Orleans Saintsâ€™ bounty case. Williams was then hired by the
Tennessee Titans as their senior assistant for defense.  The Titans said in a statement that NFL Commissioner Roger
Goodell informed them this morning that Williams had been
reinstated and his contract with the club approved.  Goodell had found that Williams oversaw the bounty plan, in
which the commissioner said players on the Saints were paid
bonuses for big hits and knocking opponents out of games. He
missed the 2012 season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
