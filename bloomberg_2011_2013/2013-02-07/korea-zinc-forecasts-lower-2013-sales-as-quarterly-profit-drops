Korea Zinc Co. , the world’s third-
biggest producer of refined zinc, said 2013 sales will probably
decline, after reporting a 17 percent drop in fourth-quarter
profit as a stronger won negated gains in metal prices.  Net income  was 139.4 billion won ($128 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 167.1 billion won a
year earlier, according to a regulatory filing from the Seoul-
based company today. The average of 17 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was 158 billion won. Full-year revenue may
drop to 5.18 trillion won in 2013 from 5.49 trillion won, the
company said.  A stronger won cuts the South Korean smelter’s profit
translated into the local currency. The company earned 80
percent of its standalone revenue overseas in 2011. The won
gained 4.6 percent against the dollar in the fourth quarter,
making the South Korean currency Asia’s best performing, while
prices of zinc and lead averaged higher.  A 10-won appreciation reduces Korea Zinc’s operating profit
by 10 billion won, Chris Kim, an analyst at Samsung Securities
Co., estimated in a Jan. 14 report. The average price of zinc
for immediate delivery rose 2 percent to $1,947.37 a metric ton
in the quarter from a year ago, while cash lead gained 10
percent to $2,196.64 a ton. Cash silver averaged 2 percent
higher at $32.5764 an ounce.  Korea Zinc  fell 1.4 percent to 385,500 won at the close in
Seoul today, bringing this year’s loss to 4.8 percent. The
benchmark  Kospi index  declined 0.2 percent today.  Operating profit decreased 30 percent to 164 billion won in
the fourth quarter, less than the 215.6 billion-won estimate
from analysts. Sales gained 8 percent to 1.41 trillion won.  To contact the reporter on this story:
