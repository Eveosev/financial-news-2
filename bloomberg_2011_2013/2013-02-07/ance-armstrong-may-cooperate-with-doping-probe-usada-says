Lance Armstrong  may cooperate with a
probe into performance-enhancing drug use in cycling by the U.S.
Anti-Doping Agency, which stripped him of his seven Tour de
France titles and barred him from Olympic sports for life.  USADA granted a request from Armstrong for a two-week
extension of its deadline for him to agree to testify under oath
as part of the investigation, the agency’s Chief Executive
Officer  Travis Tygart  said yesterday in a statement.  “We have been in communication with Mr. Armstrong and his
representatives and we understand that he does want to be part
of the solution and assist in the effort to clean up the sport
of cycling,” Tygart said.  USADA sanctioned Armstrong, 41, in August after he opted
not to contest doping charges in arbitration. The cyclist
acknowledged in a television interview with Oprah Winfrey last
month that he used a “cocktail” of testosterone,
erythropoietin and blood doping throughout his career.  Mark Fabiani, a lawyer for Armstrong, declined to comment
in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
