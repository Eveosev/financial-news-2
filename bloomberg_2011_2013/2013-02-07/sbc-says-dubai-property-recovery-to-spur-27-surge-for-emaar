Dubai’s economic and real estate
recovery will probably boost  Emaar Properties PJSC ’s share price
by 27 percent to the highest since 2008 as apartment sales pick
up amid increasing demand,  HSBC Holdings Plc  said.  The “Dubai rebound is real,” HSBC said in the note,
maintaining its overweight recommendation on the stock. “We
expect Emaar to continue performing well on the back of strong
Dubai real estate launches.”  Shares of Emaar, developer of the world’s tallest tower,
will probably gain to 6 dirhams, HSBC said in an e-mailed note,
revising its 4.80 dirham  price estimate.  Such an advance in the
shares, which closed at 4.74 today, would take Emaar to its
highest level since October 2008, the beginning of a real estate
crash in Dubai that sent prices plunging more than 65 percent.  The developer’s shares surged  30 percent in January,  the
best start of a year since the company went public in 2000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Emaar said Jan. 31
 full-year  profit advanced 18 percent after it sold more than 80
percent of projects available in 2012. Last month, it sold out
all units offered as part of a luxury hotel development in
central Dubai.  Mall, Gardens  Dubai is returning to large projects that dominated the
market before the crash after the city’s economy expanded 5
percent in 2012, the fastest pace in five years, according to
government estimates. The emirate last year announced plans to
develop the world’s largest mall, 100 hotels and gardens larger
than London’s Hyde Park, which Emaar will co-develop. It also
plans to build five theme parks for $2.7 billion.  The property industry will probably witness “a broader-
base recovery” this year, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.
Dubai first allowed expatriates to own property in 2002,
sparking a real estate boom that spurred Emaar’s share price to
 as high as 28.7 dirhams  in September 2005. The company is poised
to post a 9 percent advance in 2013 profit, according to the
mean estimate of 11 analysts on Bloomberg.  Emaar’s 14-day  relative strength index  slipped to 70 from
72 today. A reading above 70 indicates to some analysts that a
security is poised to drop.  Twelve analysts  recommend investors
buy Emaar shares while three say hold them, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
