A book by Canadian Prime Minister
 Stephen Harper  on the origins of professional ice hockey will be
published by Simon & Schuster Inc. in November, the publisher
said in a statement.  The book, which is not yet titled, draws on archival
records to examine how professional ice hockey developed at the
turn of the 20th century,  Simon & Schuster  said in a statement.  “Canadians from all walks of life enjoy cheering on the
great heroes of our national game, but it wasn’t always that
way,” Harper said in the statement. “The early days of
professional hockey featured outsized personalities who fought
pitched battles to shape the game we know and love today.”  Harper’s royalties from the book will go to a service that
supports military families, according to the press release.   To contact the reporter on this story:
