Russian  equities fell for a second
day as  OAO Sberbank  slid and concern Europe’s debt crisis will
deepen curbed appetite for riskier stocks.  The  Micex Index  declined 0.3 percent to 1,525.88 by the
close in Moscow. Sberbank, the nation’s largest lender, dropped
1.2 percent, the most in almost three weeks. Prefered shares of
OAO Bashneft, a regional oil producer, added 1 percent as oil
climbed 0.5 percent to $117.34 in London.  Sberbank fell for a second day after its program for
converting local shares into foreign-traded stock hit a ceiling,
offsetting the 9 percent profit gain it posted for January. The
stock advanced as much as 0.6 percent in London. European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  signaled policy makers are
concerned that the euro’s advance could damp inflation and
hamper an economic recovery.  “The market uses the European gatherings as an excuse for
a correction, for profit-taking,”  Vladimir Bragin , head of
research at Alfa Capital in Moscow, which manages $2.9 billion,
said by phone.  Sberbank, which has the  largest weighting  in the Micex at
15 percent, said in a statement yesterday that its depositary
receipt program had reached its limit. Depositary receipts can
only account for 25 percent of a company’s shares and 50 percent
of its listed shares, under Russian regulations.  OAO Aeroflot , Russia’s biggest airliner, added 3.1 percent
to 55.83 rubles, the largest gain on the Micex. The amount of
shares traded was 5.7 million, equivalent to about 2.2 times the
three-month average.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index  slid 0.5 percent to
1,595.36. The  Russian Depositary Index  fell 1.1 percent.  Euroclear Debut  Euroclear Bank SA announced it will start direct settlement
of ruble-denominated government debt today, opening the $100
billion so-called OFZ market to foreign investors.  Equities won’t be Euroclearable until July 2014 because
officials are concerned an increase in outside investors will
hurt liquidity,  Oksana Derisheva , deputy director of the primary
market at the exchange, said in an interview on Nov. 16 in
Moscow.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, dropped 1.3 percent to $30.26. The
 RTS Volatility Index , which measures expected swings in the
stock futures, increased 1.3 percent today to 20.14.  The number of shares traded on the Micex was 2.5 percent
above the 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
 10-day volatility  retreated to 10.614, the lowest since Dec. 28.  The Micex trades at about 5.7 times  estimated earnings  and
has added 3.5 percent this year. That compares with a multiple
of 10 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which has
gained 0.5 percent over the same period.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
