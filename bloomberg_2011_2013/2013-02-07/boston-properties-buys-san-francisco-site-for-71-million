Boston Properties Inc. , the biggest
U.S. office real estate investment trust by stock-market value,
completed the purchase of a San Francisco development site for
about $71 million in cash as rents rise in the area.  The project at 535 Mission St. will be a 27-story tower
with about 307,000 square feet (28,500 square meters) of
rentable office and retail space in San Francisco’s South of
Market district, the Boston-based REIT said today in a
statement. The price includes work already done and materials
purchased, with the total cost of the building budgeted at about
$215 million and completion planned for late next year.  San Francisco  office rents jumped 27 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, broker CBRE Group Inc. said last
month. Citywide office costs -- including rent, taxes and
service charges -- soared 36 percent, the biggest gain of any
global office market, CBRE said in a December report.  Boston Properties also said today that it agreed to pay
about $27 million for a parcel at Reston Town Center in Virginia
that’s zoned for 250,000 square feet of offices. The REIT is
evaluating a mixed-use plan for the site that could include
residences, according to the statement.  The announcements were made after the close of regular U.S.
trading. Boston Properties rose 0.2 percent to $104.23 today in
New York. The shares have fallen 1.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
