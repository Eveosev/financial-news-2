Nordic electricity for next month
fell the most in a week after the the price for power delivered
tomorrow declined, along with German month-ahead prices.  The March contract fell 1.3 percent, the biggest drop since
Jan. 31, to 37.45 euros ($50.79) a megawatt-hour as of 2:20 p.m.
on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. The
benchmark near-quarter contract dropped 0.6 percent to 36.10
euros.  Electricity for delivery around the clock tomorrow will
cost 39.80 euros a megawatt-hour on average, following today’s
auction on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo. That’s 3.1
percent lower than yesterday’s price for today, and also short
of the financial contract for tomorrow on Nasdaq OMX, which
closed at 42 euros. Forward contracts frequently track movements
in prompt prices.  German power for baseload delivery next quarter traded 0.9
percent lower at 36.95 euros a megawatt-hour after sliding as
much as 1.1 percent to 36.90 euros, according to broker data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The benchmark Nordic near-quarter contract traded 3.62
euros above the cost for operating coal-fired plants, which was
last measured at 32.48 euros a megawatt-hour for April through
June, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Generating costs
at coal-fed plants act as a reference for Nordic power prices,
which meets half of its power needs by running water through
turbines and a fifth from nuclear reactors.  “The contract is trading above the cap, set by coal-fired
power production costs, which obviously limits the upside,”
Bixia AB, a Swedish power trading company, said today in an e-
mailed report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
