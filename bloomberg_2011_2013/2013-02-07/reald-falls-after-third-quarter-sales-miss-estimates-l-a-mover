RealD Inc. , the maker of 3-D movie
projection equipment, dropped the most in more than a month
after third-quarter revenue missed analysts’ estimates.  RealD, based in Beverly Hills, California, fell 2.5 percent
to $11.36 at the close in New York, the biggest one-day dip
since Dec. 19. As of yesterday, the shares had lost 3.2 percent
in the past year compared with a 33 percent gain for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Media Index.  RealD posted revenue of $46.9 million, according to a
statement yesterday, less than the $47.8 million average of
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The company cited
lower product sales, including glasses sold in international
markets. RealD has said glasses sales will gradually decline as
more theaters recycle the eyewear.  “Today’s sell-off is unwarranted given what was a
relatively solid quarter,” said  Eric Wold , an analyst with B.
Riley Caris & Co. in San Francisco who recommends buying the
stock. “We’re heading into a very robust 3-D box-office year
with nine of the top 10 movies in 3-D versus five to six for the
past two years.”  RealD reported a net loss of $4.16 million, or 8 cents a
share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with profit of
$2.83 billion, or 5 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast
a loss of 10 cents, the average of seven estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
