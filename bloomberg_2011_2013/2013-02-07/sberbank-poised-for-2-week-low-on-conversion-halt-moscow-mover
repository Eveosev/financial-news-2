OAO Sberbank  fell in Moscow, heading
for a two-week low, a day after the country’s largest lender
said it reached a limit for converting local shares into foreign
stock.  The shares dropped as much as 1.1 percent in Moscow, before
trading down 0.6 percent at 106.24 rubles by 2:48 p.m., the
lowest since Jan. 25 on a closing-price basis. The amount of
shares traded was about 49 million, equivalent to 59 percent of
the three-month average. Sberbank rose as much as 0.6 percent in
London before trading up 0.1 percent at $14.18.  Sberbank said in a statement yesterday that its depositary
receipt program had reached its limit. Depositary receipts can
only account for 25 percent of a company’s shares and 50 percent
of its listed shares, under Russian regulations. Sberbank’s
depositary receipts are equivalent to four ordinary shares.  “The closure of the program is likely to create a discount
of the local line to depositary receipts,” VTB Capital analysts
wrote in an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
