Bank of America Corp.  sold $24.1
million of 14-month notes tied to precious metals, the first
offering linked to its proprietary index that tracks gold,
platinum, palladium and silver.  The securities, issued Jan. 30, yield three times the gains
of the Merrill Lynch Commodity Index Extra Precious Metals Plus
- Excess Return up to 13.05 percent with no protection against
losses and all capital at risk, according to a  prospectus  filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank
distributed the notes for a 2 percent fee and charges a 0.75
percent hedging fee.  The  index  was created in 2008 and tracks a weighted basket
of futures on the four metals, according to the prospectus. The
weighting of the assets changes and is determined by the bank.
It is a modified version of the Merrill Lynch Commodity Index
Extra, which tracks commodity segments.  Matt Card , a spokesman for the bank, declined to comment on
the note.  Banks create structured notes by packaging debt with
derivatives to offer customized bets to retail investors while
earning fees and raising money. Derivatives are contracts whose
value is derived from stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies,
or events such as changes in interest rates or the weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
