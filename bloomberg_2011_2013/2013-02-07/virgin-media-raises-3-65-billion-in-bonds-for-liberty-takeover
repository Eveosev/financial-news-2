Virgin Media Inc.  raised $3.65
billion with bonds in dollars and pounds as part of a planned
$8.3 billion financing package to help fund its acquisition by
 John Malone ’s Liberty Global Inc.  Britain’s second-biggest pay TV company sold eight-year
secured notes with a $1 billion portion of 5.375 percent
securities that yield 376 basis points more than government debt
and a 1.1 billion-pound ($1.73 billion), 6 percent piece that
has a 435 basis-point spread, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Virgin Media also sold 10-year, senior unsecured notes with
$530 million of 6.375 percent bonds yielding 452 basis points
more than benchmarks and 250 million pounds of 7 percent
debentures that pays an extra 490 basis points.  Liberty Global agreed this week to buy Virgin Media in a
$16 billion cash-and-stock transaction, allowing the company to
vie with Comcast Corp. to be the largest cable operator and to
take on  Rupert Murdoch ’s British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc.
Virgin Media is also seeking about $4.7 billion of loans as part
of the fundraising arranged by Credit Suisse Group AG.  The secured debt is rated BB- by Standard & Poor’s and the
senior notes are ranked two levels lower at B.  To contact the reporter on this story:
