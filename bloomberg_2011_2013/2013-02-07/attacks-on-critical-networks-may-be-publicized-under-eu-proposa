Hacking attacks on critical computer
networks underpinning financial trading, transport systems and
energy grids may be made public under draft European Union rules
published today.  Technology companies operating cloud-computing services,
search engines, application stores, social networks, e-commerce
and internet payments would also be required to report security
breaches to authorities who may choose to publicize the attacks,
according to the European Commission proposal.  The EU is seeking to beef up its defenses in the wake of
high-profile security breaches in the U.S. The  Federal Reserve 
said this week that hackers gained access to a website listing
emergency contact details for banks.  Government authorities “may inform the public or require
the public administrations or market operators to do so where it
determines that the disclosure of the incident is in the public
interest,” according to the EU proposal.  The public interest should be balanced against “possible
reputational and commercial damages” that disclosure might
cause the companies involved, according to the draft plans.
Details of product vulnerabilities shouldn’t be publicized
before a security fix is available.  Under the EU proposals, the bloc’s 27 governments would
prepare for network attacks and share information with each
other. The plans need the backing of governments and the
European Parliament to become law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
