Three former executives of  Hewlett-
Packard Co. ’s  Mercury Interactive Corp.  and the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission are in talks to settle allegations the
employees broke securities laws by backdating company stock
options, a judge said.  U.S. District Judge  William Alsup  in San Francisco didn’t
rule on arguments today by lawyers for the former executives
that the SEC allegations are too old and their clients’ actions
weren’t improper. The SEC had requested the judge decide the
case in its favor without a trial.  Alsup said both sides were holding settlement talks
immediately after the hearing and told attorneys that “I am
going to issue an order in the next few days. If you are going
to preempt that with a settlement, do it quickly.”  Alvin D. Williams, an SEC attorney, and James A. Meyers,
attorney for Mercury Interactive’s ex-general counsel  Susan Skaer , said in court that they would meet today with U.S.
Magistrate  Jacqueline S. Corley  for settlement discussions.  The agency is pursuing a five-year-old lawsuit against
former Chief Executive Officer  Amnon Landan , former Chief
Financial Officer  Douglas Smith  and Skaer over changing dates on
stock options to make them more valuable, a practice among many
technology companies that led to a federal investigation, the
ousters of 90 executives and directors, billions of dollars in
restatements and criminal charges against executives at 10
companies.  Inflates Value  SEC attorneys say more than 40 stock option grants at
Mercury Interactive were backdated from 1997 to 2002, and $258
million in compensation expenses weren’t reported to investors
as a result, according to court documents. Landon, Skaer and
Smith were all involved in the practice, the SEC said.  Backdating grants to days when share prices were low
inflates their value and may hide costs from investors if left
undisclosed. Mercury Interactive paid $28 million in 2007 to
settle a related SEC lawsuit and three former company directors
and a former chief financial officer settled SEC lawsuits over
the practice.  The executives say the company was open about backdating,
the SEC waited too long to sue and the agency lacks evidence
that they violated securities or accounting rules.  The case is SEC v. Landan, 07-2822, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco).  To contact the reporters on this story:
