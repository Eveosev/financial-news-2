The Treasury  10-year note  yield
declined, holding below 2 percent for the first time in seven
days after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi signaled
policy makers are concerned a strengthening euro will hurt
efforts to end the region’s recession, sustaining the refuge
appeal of U.S. debt.  U.S. debt fluctuated after reports showed claims for U.S.
unemployment insurance payments dropped last week and the
productivity of U.S. workers fell more than projected in the
fourth quarter. The Federal Reserve bought $1.5 billion of
Treasuries maturing from February 2036 through November 2042 as
part of its program to boost economic growth.  “Some of the problems that drove up Treasury bids in the
past, like Europe, have resurfaced,” said  David Coard , head of
fixed-income trading in New York at Williams Capital Group, a
brokerage for institutional investors. “While there are
encouraging signs of life with the economy, there’s also this
recognition that there’s still some threats out there.”  The benchmark 10-year  yield  traded at 1.96 percent at 5
p.m. New York time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The 1.625 percent note due November 2022 gained 1/32, or 31
cents per $1,000 face value, to 97 1/32.  Europe’s shared currency has gained 7.2 percent during the
past six months, the best performer of 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  Price Swings  Treasury market volatility, as  measured  by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, was 62.8 yesterday, above the 59.7
average since Sept. 13, the day the Fed announced its plan to
buy $40 billion per month of mortgage-backed securities.  “We’re in this continuing range, given the economic and
political uncertainty,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees
$2.1 billion as chief investment officer at United Nations
Federal Credit Union in New York. “We have the economic
expansion that’s been muted. There’s a wall of investor interest
at 2 percent or slightly above.”  Treasuries traded through ICAP Plc, the largest inter-
dealer broker, totaled $325.2 billion yesterday. Trading volume
has averaged $298.6 billion this year, compared with $231.7
billion through this time last year, or $237.7 billion for all
of 2012.  Jobs Data  Applications for jobless benefits dropped 5,000 to 366,000
in the week ended Feb. 2, Labor Department figures showed today.
Economists forecast 360,000 claims, according to the median of
53 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  U.S. payrolls increased by 157,000 in January, following a
revised 196,000 gain the previous month, the Labor Department
said Feb 1. Economists had forecast a gain of 165,000 jobs. The
unemployment rate climbed to 7.9 percent.  Treasuries handed investors a 0.9 percent loss this year
through yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. They fell 1 percent in January, the steepest monthly
loss since March, as money managers sought higher-yielding
assets. German bunds fell 1.5 percent.  “You can make a case on either side of the market,” said
 Thomas Roth , senior Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi
UFJ Securities USA Inc. “The fundamental data points to the
bearish case. The Fed is not backing away any time soon. That’s
what keeps the market from going down.”  Yield Forecast  Ten-year U.S. rates will increase to 2.25 percent by year-
end, according to a Bloomberg survey of financial companies.
That means an investor who buys today would incur a loss of 0.5
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Fed’s favored bond-market gauge of inflation
expectations, the five-year, five-year forward break-even rate,
which shows how much traders anticipate consumer prices will
rise during a period of five years starting in 2017, fell to
2.91 percent on Feb. 4 from a 19-month high of 2.93 percent on
Jan. 31.  The 100-day moving average of the price for the 10-year
Treasury futures contract crossed above the 50-day moving
average, a development that may indicate continued appreciation
for the security according to technical analysis,  Thomas di Galoma,  a managing director at Navigate Advisors, a brokerage
for institutional investors in Stamford, Connecticut, wrote in a
note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
