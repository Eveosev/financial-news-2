(Corrects name of company in first paragraph, name of
minister counsellor in second in story published Feb. 7.)  South Korea’s Hyundai Engineering &
Construction resumed work on projects in Libya after assurances
on compensation and security from the interim government.  Speaking in an interview in Tripoli yesterday, Korean
minister counsellor Kyunghan Kim said he “asked the Libyan
government to expedite the process of re-evaluating all existing
contracts and to resolve the compensation, non-payment, bond
call, and escalation fees for resuming the projects.”  There are 19 South Korean construction companies with 25
projects worth a total of $10.6 billion in Libya, Kim said.  The popular uprising that led to the ouster of the late
 Muammar Qaddafi  in 2011 led to a halt in foreign construction
projects. Companies have been cautious about resuming those
operations amid a rise of crime and incidents against
foreigners, including the killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris
Stevens and three others in the eastern city of Benghazi in
November.  “Many feel worried about returning to work and we are
trying to help them as much as we can,” Kim said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
