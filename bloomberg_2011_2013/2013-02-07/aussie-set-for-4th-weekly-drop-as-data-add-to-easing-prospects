Australia’s dollar was set for a
fourth weekly decline, the longest stretch since June, after the
Reserve Bank cut its economic growth and inflation forecasts,
fanning expectations it will lower interest rates.  Today’s statement followed comments from the RBA on Feb. 5
that the nation’s inflation outlook “would afford scope to ease
policy further.” The so-called Aussie earlier touched the
lowest in more than three months as Asian stocks fell, sapping
demand for higher-yielding currencies. The currency erased that
decline and New Zealand’s dollar strengthened after data showed
imports grew in China by the most in 11 months.  “The reduction in growth and inflation forecasts is a
cause for concern,” said  Takuya Kawabata , an analyst at
Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd. in Tokyo, a unit of Japan’s
largest currency margin company. “The recent weakness in the
Australian dollar in part stems from speculation of a rate cut
by the RBA.”  The Aussie was at $1.0296 as of 4:41 p.m. in Sydney from
$1.0282 yesterday, having lost 1.1 percent this week. It earlier
fell as much as 0.3 percent to $1.0256, the lowest since Oct.
23. The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, gained 0.4
percent to 83.62 U.S. cents, trimming a weekly decline to 1
percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  of shares slid as much as 0.7
percent.  The RBA predicted “below trend” 2013 growth of about 2.5
percent, compared with around 2.75 percent forecast in November.
Consumer prices will rise 3 percent in the year to June 2013,
compared with the 3.25 percent increase forecast three months
earlier, the central bank said.  Rate Outlook  Traders see about an even chance that the RBA will cut the
overnight cash-rate target to 2.75 percent in March from 3
percent, according to data on overnight-index swaps compiled by
Bloomberg.  The  yield  on Australia’s three-year bond added two basis
points to 2.82 percent. It has slid five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, this week. New Zealand’s two-year interest-
rate swap rose one basis point to 2.9 percent.  China’s  imports  jumped 28.8 percent in January from a year
earlier, the fastest gain since February 2012, data from the
nation’s customs administration showed today. Analysts had
forecast a 23.5 percent increase.  “Today’s data clearly suggests that the Chinese economy is
starting to do better, so that should help put a floor under the
Aussie,” said  Thomas Harr , the head of Asia local markets
strategy at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “The domestic
economy is not doing that well, but clearly, it is a positive
that China continues to improve.”  China was Australia’s No. 1 destination of exports in 2012
and the second-biggest overseas market for New Zealand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
