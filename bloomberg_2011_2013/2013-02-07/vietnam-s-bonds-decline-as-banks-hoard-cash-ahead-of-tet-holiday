Vietnam’s two-year government bonds
fell for the first time in a week on speculation banks are
hoarding cash before next week’s Lunar New Year holiday. The
dong was little changed.  The overnight interbank deposit  rate  rose 29 basis points
to 4.07 percent today, taking its five-day gain to 173 basis
points, according to daily fixings by banks compiled by
Bloomberg. Financial markets will be shut Feb. 11 through Feb.
15 for the holiday, known locally as Tet.  “Demand is weak as investors are inactive before the long
holiday,” said  Nguyen Duy Phong , a Ho Chi Minh City-based
analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co. “Banks also have to
conserve liquidity, so they limit investment.”  The yield on the two-year bonds rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 8.67 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,828 per dollar as of 3:44 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,830 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The State Bank of Vietnam set its
reference rate at 20,828, unchanged since December 2011,
according to its website. The currency is allowed to trade as
much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
