Swisscom AG , Switzerland’s biggest
phone company, forecast 2013 earnings that may be lower than
analyst estimates as it makes an adjustment for pension costs.  Earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will total at least 4.25 billion francs ($4.67
billion), Swisscom said. Analysts estimated 2013 Ebitda of 4.36
billion francs, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A new
accounting standard will result in a “non-cashflow relevant”
rise in pension costs of 110 million francs, the company said.  “Lower Ebitda guidance has to be seen negative,”  Serge Rotzer , an analyst at Vontobel, said in a note. “Full-year 2012
results have been broadly in line with expectations.”  Swisscom, based in Bern, is introducing new offerings to
attract customers in the face of competition, pressure on prices
and changes in consumer behavior. Growth in customers and volume
will raise direct costs, mainly for acquiring new clientss and
the procurement of handsets, the company said today. Maintenance
and expansion of the network will also temporarily increase
indirect costs, Swisscom said.  The stock  fell 0.3 percent to 403.5 francs at 11:31 a.m. in
Zurich. The shares have risen 2.5 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 20.9 billion francs.  Vivo Casa  In June, the  company  started new flat-rate mobile and
Internet plans and it has started bundled offerings such as Vivo
Casa, which combines fixed-line access with telephony, Internet
and TV. Swisscom said today that 788,000 customers used its
combined offerings such as Vivo Casa at the end of 2012.  Fourth-quarter net income was 376 million francs compared
with a net loss of 835 million francs a year earlier, when
Swisscom had a writedown for Italian fixed-line unit Fastweb.
Sales rose to 2.96 billion francs from 2.93 billion francs.  If all 2013 targets are met, Swisscom said, it plans a
dividend of 22 francs a share, in line with the 2012 payout
announced today.  “Maintaining our stable dividend, which has a yield of 6
percent -- 6 percent in today’s interest climate, in Swiss
francs -- is phenomenally attractive,” Chief Executive Officer
 Carsten Schloter  said at press conference in Zurich today.
“Investors should expect us to follow a dividend policy
characterized by stability, which is a unique selling point in
today’s context.”  Fastweb Growth  Sales will fall to 11.3 billion francs this year from 11.4
billion francs last year, Swisscom said. That revenue forecast
was in line with the average of analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Swisscom  bought Fastweb in 2007 to make up for slowing
growth in Switzerland. Fastweb added 63,000 users in the fourth
quarter for a total of 1.77 million. The business posted more
than twice as many net customer gains in 2012 than in 2011
helped by the bundled TV and broadband offering with Sky Italia
Srl, which attracted 151,000 customers to date, Swisscom said.  Swisscom expects capital expenditure to drop to 2.4 billion
francs this year from 2.53 billion francs in 2012. Capital
expenditure in Switzerland will increase to 1.75 billion francs
from 1.65 billion francs, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
