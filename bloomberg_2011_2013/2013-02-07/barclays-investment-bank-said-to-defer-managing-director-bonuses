Barclays Plc  will cap cash bonuses at
65,000 pounds ($102,000) for staff at its investment bank and
defer awards for senior managers, according to a person with
knowledge of the plans.  For the London-based bank’s 1,200 managing directors,
bonuses for 2012 will all be deferred and paid in one-third
installments from 2014 to 2016, half in cash and half in the
bank’s stock, said the person, who asked not to be identified as
the plans aren’t yet public.  The cap on cash bonuses is the same imposed by the bank
last year, when it cut remuneration for top executives by almost
half. Britain’s second-largest lender by assets was criticized
by investors when it cut its investment bankers’ pay by only 9
percent.  For more junior staff, awards greater than 65,000 pounds
and less than 250,000 pounds will see 35 percent of the total
deferred and paid half in cash and half stock. Any bonus over
250,000 pounds will be deferred, with half being paid in cash
and the rest in stock.  Sky News reported the bonus structure earlier today.
