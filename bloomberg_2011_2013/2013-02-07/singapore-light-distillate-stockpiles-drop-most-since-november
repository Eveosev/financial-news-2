Light distillate  inventories in
Singapore, Asia’s largest oil-trading and storage center, fell
10 percent the past week, the most in more than two months,
according to a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including naphtha, gasoline and
reformate dropped 1.12 million barrels to 9.7 million in the
seven days to yesterday,  International Enterprise Singapore  said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the biggest percentage
loss since the period ended Nov. 28, bringing supplies to the
lowest in six weeks.  Stockpiles of  middle distillates  including gasoil, or
diesel, and kerosene were down 827,000 barrels, or 7.2 percent,
at 10.7 million, the ministry’s data showed. That’s the first
decline in three weeks.  Residual-fuel  inventories including fuel oil and low-sulfur
waxy residue and excluding bitumen decreased 1.22 million
barrels, or 5.9 percent, to 19.4 million, according to the data.
Stockpiles slid from an eight-week high.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
