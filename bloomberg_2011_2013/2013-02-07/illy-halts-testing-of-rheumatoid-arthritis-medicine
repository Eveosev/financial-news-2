Eli Lilly & Co ., facing billions of
dollars in losses from generic competition, said it is halting
testing of an experimental drug for rheumatoid arthritis because
the studies show the medicine isn’t effective.  The decision to stop testing the therapy, called tabalumab,
in rheumatoid arthritis wasn’t based on safety concerns, the
Indianapolis-based drugmaker said today in a statement. Lilly
said it will continue to develop it as a treatment for lupus.  In December, Lilly said it was stopping one of three late-
stage rheumatoid arthritis studies of tabalumab after it failed
to provide a benefit. Lilly then did an analysis of the other
two studies and determined the drug was unlikely to help
patients. The setback comes as Lilly, counting on sales of new
medicines to revive growth, faces generic competition to
schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, which generated $5 billion in annual
revenue before losing patent protection in October 2011.  “While we are obviously disappointed by these results in
rheumatoid arthritis, we continue to believe that tabalumab
could have significant potential for patients in other disease
areas,” said Eiry Roberts, vice president of autoimmune product
development at Lilly, in a statement.  Lilly fell less than 1 percent to $53.78 at the close in
New York.  The company said it expects to take a $50 million charge in
the first quarter related to the research expenses from the
drug.  To contact the reporter on this story:
