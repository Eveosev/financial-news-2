Google Inc. ’s planned litigation
against the U.S. Internal Revenue Service centers on a domestic,
not international, tax dispute, the company said.  The lawsuit, which will be filed in U.S. Tax Court, relates
to Google’s 2003 and 2004 tax bills, Niki Fenwick, a company
spokeswoman, said today in an interview. The amount at stake is
not material to the company, she said.  Google disclosed the potential lawsuit in its  annual 10-K 
report with the Securities and Exchange Commission filed Jan.
29.  In the SEC filing,  Google  said it had settled its
outstanding 2003 and 2004 issues with the IRS during 2012 except
for “one issue which we plan to litigate in court.” The filing
provided no additional details on the substance of the dispute
or the amount of money involved.  Dean Patterson , a spokesman for the IRS, didn’t respond to
an e-mailed request for comment. Federal privacy laws prohibit
the IRS from discussing the cases of individual taxpayers and
companies.  Google  rose $3.92, or 0.5 percent, to $774.09 at 3:11 p.m.
in New York.  Google, based in Mountain View, California, has been
scrutinized by tax authorities around the world, including in
France, Italy, the U.K. and Australia.  Shifting Profits  The company has used a series of maneuvers to shift profits
out of the U.S. and into low-tax countries. The company has used
techniques such as the “Double Irish” and “Dutch Sandwich”
that route profits through Ireland and the Netherlands into
Bermuda.  In the annual filing, the company reported its effective
tax rate as 19.4 percent for 2012, down from 21.2 percent in
2010 and less than half of the combined U.S. federal and state
statutory rate of 39.1 percent.  In 2011, the company avoided about $2 billion in taxes by
shifting $9.8 billion in revenue to a Bermuda subsidiary,
Bloomberg News reported in December 2012. In 2011, the IRS was
auditing Google’s offshore deals, including how the company
valued software rights and other intellectual property it
licensed abroad.  In 2006, the IRS signed off on a 2003 intracompany
transaction that moved foreign rights to Google’s search
technology outside the U.S., Bloomberg reported in 2011. That
means future profits associated with that intellectual property
get reported outside the country.  The company  reported pretax income  in 2012 of $5.3 billion
in the U.S. and $8.1 billion outside the country.  Like most large companies, Google is regularly audited by
the IRS. The company said it expects the IRS to complete its
examination of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 tax years over the next
12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
