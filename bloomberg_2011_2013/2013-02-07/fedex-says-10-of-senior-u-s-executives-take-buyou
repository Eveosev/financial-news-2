FedEx Corp. said about 10 percent of
its senior U.S. executives have accepted buyouts under a program
to cut spending and boost profits by $1.7 billion over three
years.  FedEx declined to specify how many managers will leave the
Memphis, Tennessee-based shipping company through May 2014, said
Glen Brandow, a spokesman. The changes are part of a new
“organizational structure” at FedEx Express, the company’s
largest division, and FedEx Services.  The overhaul, announced in October, reflects FedEx’s view
that a shift of some customers to less expensive ground, freight
and even ocean shipping isn’t a temporary change linked to a
slowing economy.  Express , whose operations include the world’s
largest cargo airline, will account for about $1.55 billion of
the targeted amount.  “This is one piece of the $1.7 billion profit improvement
plan,” Brandow said in an interview yesterday on the buyouts.
The changes were announced internally to FedEx rank-and-file
employees, who will find out Feb. 15 whether they are eligible
to apply for buyouts, he said.  The shipping company, which had 101,000 workers as of Dec.
31, previously said that “several thousand”  employees  would
probably accept the offers.  The restructuring, targeted for completion by the end of
May 2016, also includes the replacement of fuel-guzzling
aircraft and about 5,000 older vehicles at the Express division,
which uses planes to expedite shipments of goods from
electronics to pharmaceuticals.  Jet Freighters  Expense-reduction efforts have been under way since
December 2011, including the deferral of some new jet-freighter
deliveries.  In June, FedEx said it was retiring 24 cargo planes and 43
older engines to match shipping volumes. It also plans to retire
21  Boeing Co.  727s this fiscal year. Those aircraft will be
replaced with Boeing 767-300 and 757-200 aircraft that burn less
fuel and cost less to fly, FedEx said.  FedEx also ordered 19 767s, to be delivered from fiscal
2015 to 2019, replacing Boeing MD-10s and Airbus SAS A310
models. The twin-engine 767s will be about 30 percent more fuel-
efficient than the three-engine MD-10s, FedEx has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
