Lazard Ltd.  climbed to the highest
price in about 18 months after reporting profit that beat
analysts’ estimates and the most annual merger-advisory revenue
in four years.  Lazard gained 2.8 percent to $37.70 at 1:41 p.m. in New
York, the highest since July 2011. The shares have advanced 26
percent this year after a 14 percent increase in 2012.  Revenue from advising on mergers and acquisitions rose 13
percent to $792.9 million in 2012 as global deal volume in the
last three months of 2012 reached the highest level since the
third quarter of 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Chief Executive Officer  Kenneth Jacobs  said resolution of budget
issues including the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic
spending cuts and tax increases may help spur the market to
additional gains.  “We’re operating not quite at 2007 levels in advisory, but
we’re pretty close to it,” Jacobs, 54, said today in a phone
interview. “Things are better, and getting past the election
and the fiscal cliff, and everybody realizing that life goes on,
has helped as well. I think this could be a reasonable year for
M&A as a result.”  Fourth-quarter earnings were $81.6 million, or 61 cents a
share, compared with $1.4 million, or 1 cent, a year earlier,
the Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm said today in a statement. That
beat the 33-cent  average estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Including $103 million in charges from a cost-cutting
plan, Lazard had a loss of $5 million, or 5 cents a share.  Net Income  Net income for the full year rose 9 percent to $194.9
million, or $1.44 a share, from $178.6 million, or $1.31 per
share.  Financial-advisory revenue climbed 19 percent in the fourth
quarter to $309.3 million from a year earlier, driven by a 40
percent surge in M&A, which increased to $233.5 million.
Restructuring revenue fell 36 percent to $48.1 million.  Lazard implemented a cost-cutting plan, targeting $125
million in annual savings, to boost operating leverage through
reductions in staff and non-compensation expenses. About $85
million of the savings will come from pay expenses associated
with job cuts and $40 million will be from non-compensation
expenses including technology and travel, Lazard Chief Operating
Officer  Alex Stern  said on a conference call today.  Lazard cut 200 jobs globally in the fourth quarter,
primarily in the financial-advisory business and support
functions, Stern said today in an interview.  Compensation Expenses  The firm set aside $341.8 million, or 60 percent of
operating revenue, for compensation costs in the fourth quarter,
compared with $337 million, or 72 percent, a year earlier.  Advisers including Lazard are set to benefit from an
increase in acquisitions after agreements by lawmakers to avoid
tax increases and spending cuts,  David Trone , an analyst at JMP
Securities LLC, said in a January note. Companies have cash and
access to cheap credit, and the passage of the fiscal cliff deal
should cause executive confidence to increase, Trone wrote.  “We are encouraged by the level of M&A activity in the
fourth quarter of 2012,” Jacobs said today on a conference call
with analysts following the results. “It indicates that CEO
confidence is improving. This has been the missing element for
an upturn in the M&A cycle as financing remains cheap and
valuations are reasonable.”  Lazard ended 2012 with a record $167 billion in assets
under management, an 18 percent increase from a year earlier,
according to the statement.  Lazard’s fourth-biggest shareholder is Trian Fund
Management LP, the hedge fund run by activist shareholder  Nelson Peltz , according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Lazard said in
an April shareholder letter it had begun a review of the firm’s
businesses after Jacobs took over in 2009 to “better align the
interests of employees and shareholders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
