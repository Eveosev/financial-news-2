Soybean output in Brazil, set to
surpass the U.S. as the largest grower, will rise more than
previously estimated to a record as growers expand planting, the
government said. The corn forecast was also raised to a record.  Growers will harvest 83.4 million metric tons in the
2012-2013 crop year that started Sept. 1, more than the 82.7
million tons estimated last month, the Agriculture Ministryâ€™s
crop-forecasting agency, known as Conab, said in a report today.
Production will climb from 66.4 million tons collected in the
past season.  Rising soybean prices are encouraging growers to expand
planting, while regular showers on corn crops are helping boost
yields after dry weather hurt output in the past season, Conab
said. Soybean futures have risen 21 percent in New York in the
last 12 months.  Soybean growers are increasing planting to 27.6 million
hectares (68.2 million acres), up from 25 million in the past
harvest, Conab said.  The corn forecast was raised to 76 million tons from 72.2
million tons estimated in January. Production will increase from
73 million tons in the previous harvest, Conab said.  The bumper corn crop led the government to announce
yesterday it will auction option contracts to purchase the grain
from producers to rebuild government stockpiles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
