 Akuo Energy SAS started building a
13-megawatt wood-pellet power plant in France, raising its
biomass investment in the country to 150 million euros ($203
million).  The 65 million-euro project in the northern Somme
department will start operating by the end of 2014 and produce
power and steam for  Bonduelle SCA â€™s biggest factory of canned
and frozen vegetables, Akuo said today in an e-mailed statement.  The company has completed a 16-megawatt plant in Nesle,
also in the Somme, that will start operating in April, the
Paris-based developer said, contributing to the total
investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
