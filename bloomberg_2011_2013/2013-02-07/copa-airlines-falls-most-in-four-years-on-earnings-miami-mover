Copa Holdings SA  tumbled the most in four years after the Panama-based airline company reported fourth quarter earnings that were below analyst expectations.  Shares in Copa fell about 11 percent to $99.03 in New York  trading , the biggest drop since December 2008. Volume of 1.86 million was 530 percent more than the company’s three-month average.  The airline reported yesterday that net income for the fourth quarter was $86.6 million, down from $104.4 million a year before. Analysts had forecast net income of $95 million. In a conference call with analysts today, Chief Financial Officer  Victor Vial  said that Copa had about $190 million of local currency cash in Venezuela, which is at risk for devaluation.  Copa shares may sink further as investors view the stock as too expensive, said  Craig Sterling , managing director and head of global equity research at New York-based Eva Dimensions.  “It’s been a very expensive stock,” Sterling said in phone interview today. “The current value is a little bit more reasonable.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Eric Sabo in Panama City at  esabo1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Bill Faries at  wfaries@bloomberg.net
