South African wheat futures dropped
for a fifth day to the lowest in more than three weeks as the
rand strengthened against the dollar, making imported grain
cheaper.  Wheat for delivery in March, the most active contract,
decreased 0.6 percent to 3,524 rand ($396) a metric ton, the
lowest since Jan. 11, by the close on the South African Futures
Exchange in Johannesburg. The five-day retreat is the longest
losing streak for a most active contract since April 17.  The rand has appreciated 0.5 percent against the dollar
this month, the biggest increase among major currencies,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The rand strengthening has caused downward pressure on
wheat prices,”  Andrew Fletcher , an independent trader, said by
phone from Kroonstad in the Free State province.  South Africa is sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest importer of
wheat after Nigeria and Sudan and its largest producer after
Ethiopia, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.  Yellow corn for July delivery declined 0.3 percent to 1,923
rand a ton, while the white variety, also for delivery in July,
fell 0.8 percent to 1,882 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
