Trafficking of drugs through Guinea-
Bissau increased after its military toppled the government last
year, a local rights group said.  Movement of narcotics through the West African nation by
South American gangs seeking to reach Europe and other parts of
the world “increased significantly and has reached alarming
proportions,” the Human Rights League of Guinea-Bissau said in
a report published on its website today. “One cannot expect a
happy ending to the crisis that has taken hold of the country
since the coup.”  The coup ousted acting President  Raimundo Pereira  and Prime
Minister Carlos Gomes Junior, who was front-runner in elections
that were due within days. Both are now in exile while a
military-backed transitional government has promised to hold a
new vote in April.  Since independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has
faced three coups, including the 2009 assassination of a
president. The nation of 1.6 million, Africa’s second-biggest
cashew-nut grower, wants investments in mining, oil and
fisheries, Prime Minister Rui Duarte de Barros said in August
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
