Allstate Corp. , the largest publicly
traded U.S. auto and home insurer, climbed in New York trading
after posting a surprise profit for the quarter in which
superstorm Sandy struck the U.S. East Coast.  Allstate  advanced  1.9 percent to $45.17 at 10:06 a.m.
Operating income, which excludes some investment results, was 59
cents a share in the fourth quarter, the Northbrook, Illinois-
based insurer said yesterday in a statement. The insurer was
expected to have a loss of 3 cents a share, according to the
average estimate of 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Allstate Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Wilson , 55, is
seeking to boost returns to shareholders through buybacks and a
higher  dividend , while raising prices to increase underwriting
profit. Excluding catastrophes, margins in the main property-
liability business improved by 4 cents per dollar in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier.  The insurer “is an unusual franchise with pricing power,
which still trades at an unchallenging valuation relative to
peers,”  Josh Stirling , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co., said in a note to clients today. Allstate has a
“disciplined management” that will drive the stock higher, he
said, raising his price target to $50 per share.  Fourth-quarter net income fell to $394 million from $712
million a year earlier as the company paid claims tied to Sandy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
