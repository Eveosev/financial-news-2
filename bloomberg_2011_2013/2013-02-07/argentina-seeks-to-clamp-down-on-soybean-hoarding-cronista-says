Argentina’s tax agency will start a
campaign to check if farmers are hoarding soybeans and force
them to sell their harvest, newspaper Cronista Comercial
reported, citing government officials that it didn’t name.  The remaining soybean harvest is estimated at 1 million to
1.2 million tons, Cronista reported. At yesterday’s closing
prices that would equal about $645.4 million of revenue, of
which the Treasury gets 35 percent, Cronista said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
