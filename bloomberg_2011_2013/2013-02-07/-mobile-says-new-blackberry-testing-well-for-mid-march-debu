T-Mobile USA, the fourth-largest U.S.
mobile-service provider, said its tests of the new BlackBerry
Z10 are going well, and it’s aiming to be the first American
carrier “out of the gate” with the phone next month.  “The device is more stable than we anticipated,” said
 Frank Sickinger , head of business sales at T-Mobile USA, a unit
of Deutsche Telekom AG. “If we are able to speed up the launch
date, we will do that. Right now it’s looking like mid-March.”  The encouraging words come a week after BlackBerry unveiled
the new phone, which is already on sale in the U.K. and Canada.
 BlackBerry , formerly known as  Research In Motion  Ltd., didn’t
give a firm U.S. release date, saying the Z10 would be available
sometime in March. That raised concern among investors, who
drove down BlackBerry’s stock 17 percent in the two days after
the debut event.  The U.S. is BlackBerry’s largest single market, and the
company is counting on the new phone to win back customers lost
to Apple Inc.’s iPhone and Google Inc.’s Android. After
pioneering the smartphone industry, BlackBerry has seen its
share of the market fall to the single digits.  While the price of the Z10 hasn’t been determined yet,
Sickinger said the $199 price BlackBerry announced Jan. 30 is
consistent with what T-Mobile USA has considered. T-Mobile USA,
based in Bellevue, Washington, should be able to offer the Z10
to business customers about a week before retail sales start,
Sickinger said.  Playing Catch-Up  For T-Mobile USA, which is merging with  MetroPCS
Communications Inc. , the Z10 could provide a new way to woo
customers -- especially business users. The carrier has been
struggling to keep pace with rivals Verizon Wireless, AT&T Inc.
and Sprint Nextel Corp. Still, all the big carriers eventually
plan to offer the new phone. BlackBerry, based in Waterloo,
Ontario, said last week that lengthier testing procedures were
behind the longer wait for the product in the U.S.  T-Mobile USA Chief Executive Officer  John Legere  has vowed
to shake up the industry with measures such as selling phones on
installment plans, rather than the typical approach of
subsidizing the devices in return for two-year commitments.  In business services, where AT&T and  Verizon  dominate,
Sickinger sees an opportunity to build on T-Mobile USA’s 5.5
percent market share. The arrival of new devices like the
BlackBerry Z10 will help win business customers, he said. T-
Mobile also will offer Apple’s iPhone later this year for the
first time.  “I’m glad to see BlackBerry launch a relevant product,”
Sickinger said. “BlackBerry stands to do very well in 2013 with
T-Mobile.”  BlackBerry shares rose 5.7 percent to $16.96 at the close
in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
