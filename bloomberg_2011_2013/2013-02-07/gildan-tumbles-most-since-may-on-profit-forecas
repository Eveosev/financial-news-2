Gildan Activewear Inc. , the top-
performing company in the benchmark Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index in  2012 , fell the most in nine months after
forecasting second-quarter earnings below analysts’ estimates.  Gildan sank as much as 5.8 percent to C$34.45 in Toronto,
the most since intraday since May 3. It shares fell 4.2 percent
to C$35.03 at 12:53 p.m. Gildan, based in Montreal, had  risen  70
percent in the past 12 months through yesterday.  The company, one of the world’s biggest suppliers of t-
shirs to makers of printed clothing, is forecasting adjusted
earnings of 54 to 57 cents a share, short of the 58-cent average
of 14  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said the second quarter will be affected by
lower net selling prices for its printwear business, short-term
manufacturing inefficiencies, the timing of the Easter holiday
shutdown, and some cost inflation.  “The cost of cotton futures has increased since the
company initiated its fiscal 2013 guidance in November,” Gildan
said in a statement. “The company has not yet purchased all of
its cotton requirements for consumption in cost of sales in the
balance of fiscal 2013.”  It assumes it will be able to buy the balance of its cotton
at approximately current prices, the company said.  Gildan reported profit of $35.3 million, or 29 cents a
share, in the first quarter ended Dec. 30, compared with a net
loss of $46.1 million, or 38 cents a share a year earlier.
Profit was 32 cents a share adjusted for certain items, ahead of
expectations of 30 cents according to the average  estimate  of 15
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
