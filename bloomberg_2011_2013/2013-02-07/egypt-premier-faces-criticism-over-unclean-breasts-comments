 A group of lawyers in a rural area
south of Cairo has filed a complaint against Egypt’s prime
minister, claiming he insulted women in the city of Bani Sweif
by saying they were not cleaning their breasts before nursing.  The claim against Prime Minister  Hisham Qandil  alleges he
slandered and insulted the city’s female residents by saying
they did not pay enough attention to personal hygiene, resulting
in infants coming down with diarrhoea.  Qandil’s comments, made during a televised discussion with
journalists earlier in the week, come as Egypt’s Islamist
leaders face renewed criticism by secularist and youth-activist
groups. They contend President  Mohamed Mursi ’s government is
putting the interests of the Muslim Brotherhood ahead of those
of the country and divorcing itself from the reality of a nation
where poverty is rife and the economy has yet to rebound from
the 2011 uprising against  Hosni Mubarak .  Prosecutors in Bani Sweif said in a faxed statement they
had referred the complaint to their counterparts in October 6, a
satellite city of Cairo.  Qandil, a former water resources minister who holds a
doctorate from the U.S., had been recalling his travels across
the country as part of earlier jobs, and discussing challenges
including access to clean water and awareness of hygiene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
