Colombia’s peso bond yields dropped
to a record low on mounting speculation policy makers will cut
interest rates further after inflation slowed in January more
than economists forecast.  The yield on government securities due in 2024 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.09 percent at the
close of trading in Bogota, the lowest since the securities were
first issued in 2009, according to the central bank.  Annual inflation slowed to 2 percent in January, the lowest
rate since April 2010, from 2.44 percent in the previous month,
the government reported Feb. 5. Policy makers will lower the
overnight lending rate by “at least” a quarter-percentage
point to 3.75 percent, according to  Daniel Escobar , the head
analyst at Global Securities in Bogota.  “For those of us who weren’t expecting more cuts, the
inflation report changed our mind,” said Escobar, who now
expects a reduction at the central bank’s Feb. 22 meeting.  The January inflation reading was lower than all 25
 forecasts  compiled by Bloomberg. Banco de la Republica, which
has cut the benchmark lending rate by 1.25 percentage points
since July, has an inflation target of 2 percent to 4 percent.
Colombia has the lowest inflation rate among major Latin
American economies after Chile.  The peso weakened 0.1 percent to 1,792.33 per U.S. dollar
today and has fallen 1.2 percent in the past month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
