The following is the text of
the new house price index report for December released by
Statistics Canada.  The New Housing Price Index (NHPI) rose 0.2% in December,
following a 0.1% increase in November.  The combined metropolitan region of Toronto and Oshawa, as
well as the region of Calgary, were the top contributors to the
advance. Builders indicated that market conditions were the
primary reason for higher prices in Toronto and Oshawa, while
increased material and labour costs contributed to higher prices
in Calgary.  The largest monthly price advances in December occurred in
Winnipeg and St. Catharines-Niagara, where prices increased 0.8%
in both regions. The increase in Winnipeg, the largest monthly
increase in that city since September 2011, was largely because
of increased land development costs. In St. Catharines-Niagara,
builders reported new higher list prices for new phases of
development.  Monthly prices declined 0.9% in Charlottetown, as a result
of lower negotiated selling prices. This was the largest monthly
price decrease in that city since March 2008.  Prices decreased in Vancouver (-0.3%) and Victoria (-0.1%)
for the second consecutive month. Builders in those regions
cited market conditions as the reason for the drop in December.
Monthly prices for new houses in both cities have decreased or
remained unchanged for most of the year.  Prices were unchanged in 8 of the 21 metropolitan regions
surveyed in December.  Year in review  In 2012, the annual average increase in new housing prices
was 2.4%, following a 2.2% rise in both 2011 and 2010, and a
2.3% decline in 2009. The increase in the NHPI in 2012 was the
largest since 2008, when average prices increased 3.4%.  On a year-over-year basis, the NHPI rose 2.3% in the 12
months to December, following a 2.2% increase the previous month.  The main contributor to the advance was the combined
metropolitan region of Toronto and Oshawa, where the year-over-
year-increase in contractors’ selling prices was 3.9%. However,
new housing price increases in this region have begun to slow,
following strong year-over-year growth in 2011 and the early
part of 2012.  In Winnipeg, where the pace of the annual increases has
been accelerating over the last few months, year-over-year
prices were up 5.0% in December 2012, compared with a 4.6%
increase over the same period in 2011.  Other significant year-over-year increases occurred in St.
Catharines-Niagara (+3.3%), Regina (+3.2%) and Calgary (+3.1%).
Larger annual price increases in St. Catharines-Niagara and
Calgary were observed in the fourth quarter of 2012, compared
with earlier in the year.  Among the 21 metropolitan regions surveyed, 4 posted 12-
month price declines in December. The largest decrease continues
to be in Victoria (-3.0%) where, year over year, prices have
been declining since the latter part of 2008.  Note to readers  The New Housing Price Index measures changes over time in
the selling prices of new residential houses agreed upon between
the contractor and the buyer at the time of the signing of the
contract. It is designed to measure the changes in the selling
prices of new houses where detailed specifications pertaining to
each house remain the same between two consecutive periods. The
prices collected from builders and included in the index are
market selling prices less value added taxes, such as the
Federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) or the Harmonized Sales Tax.  Effective January 1, 2013, the Quebec Sales Tax (QST) will
be calculated on the selling price not including GST. However,
to ensure the total taxes payable remains the same, the QST rate
will be increased to 9.975%.  The provincial government of British Columbia introduced
legislation on May 14, 2012, announcing the return to a
provincial sales tax on April 1, 2013. From April 1, 2012, until
March 31, 2013, there are new housing transitional rebates in
place. After the transition is complete, the provincial sales
tax on building materials in British Columbia will be embedded
in contractors’ selling prices of new houses. These changes will
be reflected in the New Housing Price Index as reported by
respondents.  The indexes are not subject to revision and are not
seasonally adjusted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
