Tokyo Electron Device Ltd. , a unit of
Japan’s biggest chip-making equipment maker, formed a
partnership with Basho Technologies Inc. to expand its cloud
service in the country.  Tokyo Electron Device, 55 percent owned by  Tokyo Electron
Ltd. , took a stake in Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Basho, the
companies said in a statement today. They didn’t say how much
money the Yokohama, Japan-based distributer of network equipment
and semiconductors invested.  Basho, set up by a group of engineers and executives from
Akamai Technologies Inc. in 2008, is expanding in Japan with its
Riak open-source distributed database for cloud computing. The
company set up an office in Tokyo and received $6.1 million in
investment from a unit of  Yahoo Japan Corp . last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
