Liverpool defender  Jamie Carragher 
will retire after the season, ending a career that saw him make
the second-most appearances for the Premier League soccer club.  Carragher, 35, helped Liverpool win the Champions League,
the UEFA Cup, two F.A. Cups and three League Cups after making
his first-team debut as an 18-year-old in 1997.  “This will be my last season at Liverpool and my last as a
professional footballer,” he said in a  statement  on Liverpool’s
website. “I will be fully committed between now and the end of
the season to doing the very best for Liverpool Football Club,
as I’ve done my entire career since joining aged just nine years
old.”  Carragher’s 723 appearances for Liverpool rank second to
Ian Callaghan’s total of 857. He holds the club mark of 148
games in European competition and played 38 times for the
England national team, including at the 2006 and 2010 World
Cups.  “I won’t be making any further comment on this decision
until the end of the season,” he said. “All our focus and
concentration should be on achieving the best possible finish in
the league this season and trying to win the last remaining
trophy we are competing in.”  Liverpool is seventh in the Premier League this season,
nine points behind fourth-place Tottenham in the final Champions
League qualifying place. The Reds face Zenit St. Petersburg in
the Europa League round of 32 starting Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
