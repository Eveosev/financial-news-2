SAS Group, the biggest Nordic
airline, faces a subsidy complaint from low-cost rivals asking
the European Commission to investigate possible government aid.  The European Low Fares Airline Association, whose members
include  Ryanair Holdings Plc  and EasyJet Plc, said SAS’s credit
line of 3.5 billion Swedish krona ($550 million) is illegal
state aid because it’s “effectively” guaranteed by the
Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments that own stakes in the
carrier.  “The credit concerned is being deployed to support an
ambitious program of fleet renewal and expansion of the SAS
network, significantly distorting competition with SAS’s
competitors which have no recourse to such state support,” John
Hanlon, ELFAA secretary general, said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Europe’s sovereign debt crisis is weighing on carriers from
the Balkans to the Baltic as austerity programs coincide with
high fuel prices and a European Union clampdown on aid. SAS,
which has suffered annual net losses since 2007, last year
announced cost cuts to help it become profitable and increased
its credit line, extending it until March 2015.  Elisabeth Manzi, a spokeswoman for Stockholm-based SAS,
declined to comment because any subsidy complaint would be
addressed to the governments involved in the alleged aid. The
commission declined to immediately comment.  EU regulators must approve large state payments to
companies to check if they give a firm an unfair advantage over
rivals. ELFAA previously challenged SAS’s 2009 share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
