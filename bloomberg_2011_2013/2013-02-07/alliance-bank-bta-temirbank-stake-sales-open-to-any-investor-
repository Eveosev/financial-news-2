The sale of stakes in state-run
Kazakh lenders  BTA Bank ,  Alliance Bank  and Temirbank will be
open to “any investor,” according to the national wealth
fund’s deputy chief executive officer.  Local investors and banks will also be able to participate
in the sale,  Yelena Bakhmutova  told reporters in Astana today.
The wealth fund, Samruk-Kazyna, has been weighing a merger of
Temirbank and Alliance Bank and will seek a buyer for both, she
said.  President  Nursultan Nazarbayev  ordered the sale of the
state’s stakes in the three lenders this year on Feb. 4. The
government used Samruk-Kazyna in 2009 to take over and bail out
the banks, which restructured about $20 billion in debt after
defaulting that year. BTA restructured its debt in December for
the second time since 2010.  Samruk-Kazyna propped up lenders rocked by a credit squeeze
in 2009 using money out of $10 billion tapped from the National
Oil Fund. BTA, Alliance and Temirbank restructured about $20
billion in debt after defaulting that year. BTA restructured its
debt in December for the second time since 2010, the lender said
that month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
