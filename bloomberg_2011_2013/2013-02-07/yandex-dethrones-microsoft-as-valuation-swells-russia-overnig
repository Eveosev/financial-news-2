expensive level ever versus Russian stocks traded in the U.S. as
the company overtook Microsoft Corp. on global Internet searches
and web advertising grew in 2012.  Shares of Yandex jumped 1.7 percent to $24.33 in New York
yesterday, the highest level this week. Russia’s most-used
search engine traded at 28.6 times estimated earnings, more than
six times the average valuation of companies listed on  Bloomberg

total advertising, data released Feb. 5 showed. Yandex got 90
percent of third-quarter revenue from text-based ads.  “Russian speakers prefer Internet searches in Russian, and
Yandex firmly holds the biggest share, competitors are nowhere
near it,”  Konstantin Chernyshev , the head of research at
UralSib Capital Corp., which rates Yandex a buy, said by phone
from Moscow yesterday. “The Russian Internet advertising market
expands and Yandex wins. You don’t advertise your shoe repair
kiosk on national television, you advertise it on Yandex.”  Russia’s  Micex Index  fell 0.5 percent to 1,523.12 today,

($10 billion) in 2012, with Internet ads expanding more than any
other segment of the market, according to the Association of
Communication Agencies of Russia, or AKAR. The data excludes
value-added tax, AKAR said in a statement on its website.  Online advertising in Russia will rise by an average 22
percent a year between 2013 and 2016, UralSib’s Chernyshev said.  While Yandex, which has jumped 13 percent in New York this
year, surpassed Microsoft’s Bing by number of searches, it
trailed Google Inc., Beijing-based Baidu Inc. and Yahoo! Inc.,
Reston, Virginia-based ComScore said yesterday.  Searches on Yandex rose to 4.6 billion in November and 4.8
billion in December, while the tally for Bing held at 4.5
billion in both months. The Russian Internet company had the
lowest number of so-called unique searchers among the world’s
five biggest providers, the data showed. Yandex had 74.4 million
users in December, compared with 268.6 million for Microsoft,
according to ComScore.  ‘Russian Audience’  “It’s thanks to the Russian audience that the number of
Yandex searches grew,”  Tatiana Komarova , a Moscow-based
spokeswoman for the company, said by e-mail yesterday.
“Internet penetration is still low in Russia and it continues
to grow by adding older people and residents of small towns.”  Russia had 16.1 million IPv4 addresses in the third quarter
of last year, compared with 99 million in China, 145 million in
the U.S. and 683 million worldwide, according to Akamai
Technology’s State of the Internet report released last month.

immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment on the
