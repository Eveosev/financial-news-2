Malaysian ringgit forwards fell,
approaching a six-month low, before data forecast to signal
growth in Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy is slowing. The
currency declined for a second day in the spot market.  Exports rose 1.4 percent in December from a year earlier,
compared with 3.3 percent in November, while industrial-
production growth eased to 6 percent from 7.5 percent in the
same period, according to separate Bloomberg surveys of
economists before official figures due tomorrow. The European
Central Bank will  meet  today to review policy amid calls for
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to resign after contested
reports that he or members of his People’s Party received
illegal payments.  “The pace of growth for Malaysia’s exports and industrial
production could dip a bit,” said  Choong Yin Pheng , senior
manager for fixed income and economic research at Hong Leong
Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The political concerns in Spain are
top on investors’ radar.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.1 percent
to 3.1631 per dollar as of 8:58 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts touched 3.1651,
approaching the 3.1906 level reached on Feb. 1, which was the
weakest since Aug. 3. The contracts to buy or sell the ringgit
in a year traded at a 1.9 percent discount to the spot rate.
Non-deliverable forwards are settled in dollars.  The ringgit weakened 0.1 percent to 3.1035 per dollar, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The currency’s one-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, held at 7.70 percent.  Government bonds were steady yesterday. The yield on the
4.16 percent notes due July 2021 held at 3.46 percent, according
to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
