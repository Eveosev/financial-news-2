Punch Taverns Plc , the owner of about
4,500 U.K. pubs, surged to the highest price in 18 months after
saying it plans to restructure 2.4 billion pounds ($3.8 billion)
of mortgage-backed bonds.  The stock  climbed  21 percent to 13 pence, the biggest
jump since August 2009, leading advancing companies on the
 FTSE All-Share Index . Punch rose as much as 47 percent earlier
in the day. Trading volume was almost 17 times the three-month
daily average.  “The current situation is not sustainable so we need to do
something about our capital structure, which at the moment has
too much debt,”  Stephen Billingham , Punch Taverns’ executive
chairman, said in a telephone interview. “This proposal doesn’t
involve bringing new investors in, nor is it a debt for equity
proposal.”  Punch started talks with some of its biggest investors and
bondholders last year on possible options for restructuring its
debt, which is split between two bond issues. It’s proposing to
delay repayments to Punch A notes and cut 229 million pounds
from the Punch B issue, according to a statement.  The deal would reduce annual interest payments by about
10 million pounds and is supported by holders of more than 50
percent of the shares, Billingham said. It needs approval from
investors holding at least 75 percent of each of the 16 classes
of Punch A and B notes, bond insurers Ambac Financial Group Inc.
and MBIA Inc., as well as swap counterparties, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
