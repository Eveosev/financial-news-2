the average  valuation  on the China-US gauge has increased 12
percent from a Sept. 4 low to 13 times estimated earnings. The
Shanghai Composite Index of domestic shares will drop about 8
percent before resuming gains because its 6.6 percent jump this

executive officer and founder of Market Studies LLC.  “The market is overextended and the correction is
healthy,”  Elena Ogram , who manages $50 million in emerging

first-quarter revenue will be in the range of a 2 percent drop

million mean projection of analysts.  Sinopec Sinks  ADRs of China Petroleum, Asia’s biggest refiner known as
Sinopec, lost 3.8 percent to $110.5, set for the lowest level

greenhouse gases, should accelerate plans to produce cleaner

million, with the rules being implemented nationwide by 2017,
the cabinet said.  Sinopec will spend about 30 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) a
