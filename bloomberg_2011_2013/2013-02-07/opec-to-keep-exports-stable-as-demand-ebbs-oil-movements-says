The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will keep shipments stable this month as
winter demand in the northern hemisphere fades and refiners
begin maintenance, according to tanker tracker Oil Movements.  The group that supplies about 40 percent of the world’s oil
will export 23.68 million barrels a day in the four weeks to
Feb. 23, little changed from 23.67 million in the previous
period, the researcher said today in an e-mailed report. Those
figures exclude Angola and Ecuador.  “The tanker market is completely dead,”  Roy Mason , the
company’s founder, said by phone from Halifax, England.
Shipments will probably decline over the next month, he added.  Saudi Arabia  kept production near 9 million barrels for a
second month, according to a Gulf official with knowledge of the
country’s oil policy, helping to maintain OPEC output at close
to the group’s ceiling of 30 million barrels a day.  Middle East shipments will also remain stable at 17.38
million barrels a day in the period, compared with 17.37 million
in the four weeks to Jan. 26, according to Oil Movements. That
figure includes non-OPEC members Oman and Yemen.  Crude on board tankers will average 463.41 million barrels,
down 2.5 percent on the previous period, the data show. Oil
Movements calculates the volumes by tallying tanker bookings.
Its figures exclude crude held on vessels for storage.  OPEC comprises Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. The organization is next scheduled to
meet in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
