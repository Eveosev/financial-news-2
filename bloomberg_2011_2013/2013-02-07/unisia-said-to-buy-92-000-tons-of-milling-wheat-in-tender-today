Tunisia’s state grains office
purchased 92,000 metric tons of soft milling wheat from Casillo
Commodities, according to two traders with direct knowledge of
the tender.  The office bought three 25,000-ton cargoes of milling wheat
and one 17,000-ton cargo at $354 to $360.25 a ton for delivery
in March, said the traders, who asked not to be identified
because the results haven’t been announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
