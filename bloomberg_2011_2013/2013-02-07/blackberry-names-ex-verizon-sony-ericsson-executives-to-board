BlackBerry, a week after unveiling a
new smartphone lineup, bolstered its board by adding former
executives from  Verizon Communications Inc . and Sony Ericsson
Mobile Communications AB.  Dick Lynch , a retired executive video president of Verizon,
and  Bert Nordberg , the former chief executive officer at Sony
Ericsson, will bring the board to 12 members, Waterloo, Ontario-
based BlackBerry said today in a statement.  BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion Ltd., is
rolling out the BlackBerry 10 lineup globally over the coming
weeks. Its Z10 model has already gone on sale in the U.K. and
Canada, with plans to make it available in the U.S. next month.
The company is counting on the phones to revive sales, restore
profitability and win back market share from Apple Inc. and
Google Inc.’s Android.  BlackBerry shares rose 0.2 percent to $16.05 yesterday in
New York. The stock has climbed 35 percent this year on optimism
that the new phone can help fuel a comeback.  Maynard Um , an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co., upgraded the
stock to the equivalent of a buy today. The smartphone maker’s
“gross margin will improve as the mix of BlackBerry 10 devices
ramps,” he said in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
