Soybean futures rose for the fourth
time in five sessions as China increased imports from the U.S.,
the world’s biggest shipper. Corn headed for the longest slump
in eight weeks.  In the week ended Jan. 31, U.S.  exporters  sold 696,600 tons
of soybeans to China for delivery before Aug. 31 and an
additional 691,000 tons for the 12 months starting Sept. 1, the
Department of Agriculture said today. U.S.  sales  of soybean meal
since Oct. 1 to all destinations are 43 percent ahead of a year
earlier, and soybean oil tripled.  “Chinese purchases of U.S. soybeans were a surprise,”
 Jerry Gidel , the chief feed-grain analyst for Rice Dairy LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “We are also selling
more soybean meal and oil, and that will increase U.S. processor
demand” for the oilseed, he said.  Soybean futures for March delivery gained 0.3 percent to
$14.915 a bushel at 11:08 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the oilseed fell as much as 0.6 percent after the
Brazilian government raised its forecast for this year’s
harvest. On Feb. 4, the price touched $14.98, the highest since
Dec. 17.  In Chicago, corn futures for March delivery fell 1.1
percent to $7.145 a bushel. The price dropped for the fifth
straight session, the longest slump since Dec. 13. On Feb. 1,
the grain reached $7.4625, the highest since Dec. 7.  Corn fell on speculation that the USDA will say tomorrow
that U.S. inventories will be larger than forecast last month. A
larger crop in Brazil cut U.S. exports and reduced gasoline
demand slowed production of grain-based ethanol, Gidel said.  Inventory in the U.S. on Aug. 31 will probably be 616
million bushels, more than the 602 million predicted by
government in January, according to the average estimate of 31
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Brazil’s corn output this year will rise 5.3 percent to 76
million metric tons from a year earlier, the government said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
