Rates to ship liquefied natural gas
may decline as winter-fuel demand subsides even as the price gap
between Europe and Asia makes it profitable to shift cargoes
between the regions, according to Arctic Securities ASA.  Spot rates were unchanged from last week at $126,000 a day,
 Erik Nikolai Stavseth , an Oslo-based analyst at the investment
bank, said in an e-mailed report today, citing figures from
shipbroker Fearnley LNG. The premium for the frozen fuel in Asia
widened to $9 per million British thermal units, he said.  “It seems that the sentiment is somewhat softer at
present,” Stavseth said in the report. “While high arbs could
support rates, we find that rates could slide as we move out of
what seems like an extremely tight winter market from a volume
perspective.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
