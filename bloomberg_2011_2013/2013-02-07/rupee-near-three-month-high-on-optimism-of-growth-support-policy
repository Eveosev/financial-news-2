India’s rupee traded within 0.6
percent of a three-month high on speculation policy makers will
take more steps to boost growth, which the government predicts
will slow to a decade-low this fiscal year.  Gross domestic product will increase 5 percent in the year
through March, below last year’s 6.2 percent and the least since
4 percent in 2002-2003, according to a Central Statistical
Office statement released in New Delhi today. The median of 34
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was 5.5 percent. The rupee
dropped briefly by as much as 0.1 percent after the data was
published. The central bank lowered borrowing costs last month
and said slowing inflation gives some room for more easing.  “We are likely to see more rate cuts because the focus is
shifting to growth,” said Ravi Ranjit, chief manager at Federal
Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “That will lead to more inflows into
stocks in support of the currency, although we are seeing dollar
demand from importers as well.”  The rupee was little changed at 53.1850 per dollar as of
12:09 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 52.8900 yesterday, the strongest level since Oct. 17.
One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
exchange rate used to price options, fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 9.48 percent.  Global funds bought a net $942 million of Indian shares on
Feb. 5, the most since Feb. 23, 2012, exchange data show.
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi heads a meeting of
policy makers today in Frankfurt, while euro-area leaders gather
for a summit in Brussels.  IMF View  India’s monetary authority should refrain from cutting
interest rates until inflation is contained even as the nation
faces a subdued economic recovery, according to the
International Monetary Fund.  GDP will climb 5.4 percent in the 12 months through March
2013, and 6 percent the following fiscal year, the Washington-
based lender said in a statement released yesterday. Inflation
will ease to 7.2 percent by March 2014 from 7.8 percent in March
this year, while the budget deficit may be 5.6 percent of GDP
this fiscal year, above the government’s 5.3 percent goal, it
added.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 54.22 per
dollar, compared with 54.20 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.07 versus 54.05. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
