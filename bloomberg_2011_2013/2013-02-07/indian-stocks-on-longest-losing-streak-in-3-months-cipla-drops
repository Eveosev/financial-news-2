Indian  stocks fell for a sixth day,
the longest losing streak since November, after the government
forecast the weakest economic growth in a decade.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index , or Sensex, fell 0.3 percent
to 19,588.16, according to preliminary closing prices.  Cipla
Ltd. , India’s third-biggest drugmaker, declined 2.7 percent to a
two-week low. Utility NTPC Ltd. lost 2.5 percent, the lowest
price since June, as the government sold $2.1 billion of shares
in the company, the largest offering since March.  Gross domestic product may grow 5 percent in the 12 months
through March 31, below last year’s 6.2 percent and the least
since 4 percent in 2002-2003, government data showed. Asia’s
third-largest economy is in a weaker position than before the
global financial crisis and the central bank must refrain from
cutting borrowing costs further until inflation is contained,
the International Monetary Fund said yesterday.  India’s Finance Minister  Palaniappan Chidambaram  has vowed
to pare the shortfall to damp price pressures, part of a wider
policy overhaul since mid-September to revive confidence in
Asia’s third-biggest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
