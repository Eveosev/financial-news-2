Surana Ventures Ltd. , an Indian maker
of solar panels, plans to raise $25 million to fund its projects
and capacity expansion.  Surana will raise the money through a mix of debt and
equity, Managing Director  Narender Surana  said in phone
interview yesterday from Secunderabad, where the company is
based. It is in talks with Middle East and Indian investors for
fundraising, he said.  Surana plans to set up two 5-megawatt solar power projects
near Hyderabad through its newly formed subsidiary, Surana Solar
Systems Pvt. Ltd., he said. About $15 million of the cash will
be spent on commissioning the expansion of its panel unit in
Hyderabad and the rest on developing solar power projects, he
said.  The  shares  of the company in Mumbai were trading at 33.55
rupees, down 1.1 percent at 2:53 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
