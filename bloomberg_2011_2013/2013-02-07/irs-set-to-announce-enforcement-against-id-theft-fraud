The Internal Revenue Service will
announce “new details about a nationwide enforcement effort”
to combat tax refund fraud committed through identity theft, the
agency said.  Steven Miller , the acting commissioner, will speak on a
conference call with reporters at 1 p.m. in Washington.  The U.S. tax filing season opened Jan. 30. Last year, the
IRS said it prevented $20 billion in fraudulent refunds from
being issued, up from $14 billion the previous year.  The agency has said combating identity theft is one of its
top priorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
