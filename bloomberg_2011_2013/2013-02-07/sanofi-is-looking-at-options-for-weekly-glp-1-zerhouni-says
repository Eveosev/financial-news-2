Sanofi , France’s biggest drugmaker,
is considering options for a once-weekly GLP-1 diabetes
treatment,  Elias Zerhouni , Sanofi’s global research and
development chief, said.  “We’re looking at various options,” Zerhouni told
analysts during a conference call today. He declined to comment
further.  Sanofi will bring two projects into clinical development
for biosimilar insulins in a bid to broaden its diabetes
portfolio. The French company is facing competition in the
insulin field from rivals including  Novo Nordisk A/S  and  Eli
Lilly & Co.   “They are not biosimilars of our own molecules,” Sanofi
Chief Executive Officer  Chris Viehbacher  said during the
conference call with reporters. He didn’t elaborate.  Sanofi’s top-selling Lantus insulin last year garnered 4.96
billion euros ($6.6 billion) in sales, the company said today.
Results from two late-stage trials for a new formulation of
Lantus, also known as insulin glargine, are expected in the
second quarter, Sanofi also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
