Cincinnati Financial Corp ., the Ohio-
based property-and-casualty insurer, advanced as fourth-quarter
profit beat analysts’ estimates on the best underwriting result
in a decade.  Cincinnati Financial rose 1.7 percent to $44.68 at 10:38
a.m. in New York, the biggest gain in the 22-company Standard
and Poor’s 500  Insurance Index . The insurer had advanced about
31 percent in the 12 months through yesterday.  Net income  increased 43 percent to $192 million, the
Fairfield-based company said yesterday in a statement. Operating
profit was $1.11 per share, compared with the 49-cent average
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The company
spent 81.9 cents of every premium dollar on claims and expenses,
the lowest for a quarter in 10 years.  Results were “driven by a materially better-than-expected
underwriting result,” Sandler O’Neil & Partners LP analysts led
by  Paul Newsome  said in a note yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
