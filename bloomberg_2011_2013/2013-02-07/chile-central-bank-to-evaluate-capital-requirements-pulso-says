Chilean policy maker  Enrique Marshall 
said the central bank will consider measures such as raising
capital requirements, even after banks tightened lending
requirements in the fourth quarter, Pulso reported today.  Credit is expanding more slowly than in previous periods of
economic expansion, Marshall told the Santiago-based financial
daily Pulso in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
