Allianz SE , Europeâ€™s biggest insurer,
plans to increase European commercial property lending to 1.5
billion euros ($2 billion) this year as the company seeks to
boost investment returns.  Allianz Real Estate will make about seven loans in France
and Germany, spokeswoman  Melanie Epp  said today. By 2015, the
Munich-based company plans to have 5 billion euros of European
lending on its balance sheet. In 2012, the company made five
loans valued at about 1 billion euros in Germany, she said.  Allianz and other insurers are attracted by the higher
interest income generated by commercial property loans compared
with government bonds. Banks, which dominate property lending in
Europe, are pulling back after incurring losses in the financial
crisis. That has forced real-estate borrowers to look elsewhere
for refinancing and new funds.  Last year, Allianz and two other banks lent  650 million-
euro s to the owners of the Centro shopping mall in western
Germany. The company has about 5 billion euros of loans to U.S.
property investors.  Allianz is already one of the most active buyers of
European commercial buildings. Last year, it bought shopping
malls and offices in Germany, France and Poland valued at about
1.8 billion euros. The company has said it plans to increase
real estate assets to about 30 billion euros.  The news was first reported by Co-Star Group Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
