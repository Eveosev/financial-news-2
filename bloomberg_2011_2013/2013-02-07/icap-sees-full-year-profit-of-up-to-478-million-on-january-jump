ICAP Plc , the world’s largest broker
of transactions between banks, said it expects full-year
earnings of as much as 305 million pounds ($478 million) after
trading volumes increased in January.  Pretax profit for the year through March will be between
280 million pounds to 305 million pounds in line with analyst
estimates, the London-based firm said in a statement today.
While third-quarter trading conditions were “challenging” and
group revenue fell an annual 13 percent, electronic trading
volumes jumped 17 percent in January, it said.  “While December was even slower than expected, we’ve seen
a marked improvement in trading volumes since the beginning of
January across our entire business, although it is premature to
tell if this is the start of a more sustained upturn,” Chief
Executive Officer  Michael Spencer  said in the statement.  ICAP has been seeking ways to bolster earnings as the
financial crisis crimps transactions on its foreign-exchange and
fixed-income trading platforms. The company said it “remain on
track” to achieve cost cuts of more than 50 million in the
current year, with at least 60 million pounds of annualized
savings by year-end.  Interdealer brokers such as ICAP act as a go-between for
banks that trade bonds, stocks, currencies, energy and
derivatives. They profit when prices fluctuate because more
traders use the products they trade.  To contact the report on this story:
