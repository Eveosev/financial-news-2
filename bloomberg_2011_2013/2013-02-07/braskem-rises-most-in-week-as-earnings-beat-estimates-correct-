Braskem SA , Latin America’s largest
petrochemicals producer, rose after reporting fourth-quarter
earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  Shares jumped 1.4 percent to 14.81 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo. The benchmark Bovespa index fell 1
percent.  Braskem reported net income of 275 million reais ($139.8
million) in the three months ended in December, which compares
with a net loss of 172 million reais a year earlier, according
to a regulatory filing today. Analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg had
forecast adjusted profit to be 238 million reais.  Braskem said net sales increased 8 percent to 9.23 billion
reais in the fourth quarter, as a weaker real boosted the
company’s exports. The Brazilian currency fell 9 percent in
2012, the biggest slump among its major emerging-market peers
after Argentina’s peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
