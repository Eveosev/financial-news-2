A former U.K. lawyer was sentenced to
four years in jail for false accounting in a 2.8 million-pound
($4.4 million) fraud that helped fund a lavish lifestyle of
yachts, cars and multiple homes. He was also convicted of
forging letters to try to receive a civic honor.  Nathan Andrew Iyer, an ex-lawyer at Ince & Co., set up
bogus companies, created false invoices and opened bank accounts
over 12 years to help fund his spending, the Metropolitan Police
Service said in a statement.  “Iyer displayed an astounding degree of audacity,” Mark
Cross, the investigating police officer, said in an e-mailed
statement. “He abused his position as a solicitor and partner
of his law firm to defraud the company and its clients out of
millions of pounds, in order that he could live a flash
lifestyle.”  Faye Lynam, a spokeswoman for Ince & Co., said all clients
affected by the fraud had been reimbursed. Iyer, 46, also tried
to receive the Order of the British Empire by writing fake
letters to the Department of Health, claiming he had raised
millions for a cancer charity, police said.  U.K. civic honors are awarded to well-known names and
members of the public who are deemed to have made a major
contribution to British society.  The Crown Prosecution Service declined to give details of
Iyer’s lawyers in the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
