Air Canada , the country’s largest
airline, narrowed its fourth-quarter loss as it attracted more
passengers and cut its aircraft maintenance bill.  Excluding foreign exchange effects, the loss was 2 Canadian
cents a share, compared with a 60-cent loss a year earlier. That
compares with a 23-cent loss average estimate from a Bloomberg
 survey  of 11 analysts.  Competition for Canada’s largest airline is set to increase
later this year as discount rival  WestJet Airlines Ltd.  begins
operating its Encore regional unit. Air Canada responded Feb. 1
by introducing turboprop service in Western Canada, WestJet’s
backyard, and boosting capacity to meet “strong” demand.  Air Canada said Dec. 18 it plans to begin operating a low-
cost carrier, called Air Canada Rouge, in July to help capture
additional traffic. The company plans to hire 200 flight
attendants and pilots for the new unit, which will initially
serve destinations in Europe and the Caribbean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
