Romania’s Economy Minister  Varujan Vosganian  supports the reopening of mines wherever possible, the
ministry said today.  The government plans to promote private investment in areas
where mining potential hasn’t been totally tapped and can boost
economic activity, the Bucharest-based ministry said in an e-
mailed statement. Mines have closed in Romania for environmental
reasons since the country joined the European Union in 2007.  Romanian mining needs “a predictable regulatory
framework,” the ministry said. New regulations, “currently
blocked in the approval process at different governmental
levels,” may help reduce the state’s role in the industry, it
said.  Vosganian said on Jan. 19 that new negotiations may be
needed with  Gabriel Resources Ltd . over the government’s stake
of about 20 percent in the Rosia Montana gold mine project and
over how long mining can take place at the site. He told the
Antena 3 television station that while he supports projects that
create new jobs, the Rosia Montana project doesn’t currently
have an environmental permit, which means it cannot be included
in the ministry’s short-term plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
