The New York Islanders lost 4-1 to
the New York Rangers a few hours after acquiring four-time All-
Star goaltender  Tim Thomas  in a trade from Boston.  J.T. Miller had two goals as the Rangers won at their
Madison Square Garden home last night.  Marian Gaborik  and  Ryan McDonagh  added goals for the Rangers in the season’s first game
between the New York teams.  John Tavares  scored for the
Islanders.  Thomas, a two-time Vezina Trophy winner as the best
goaltender in the National Hockey League, has not played this
season after telling the Bruins he’ll sit out the campaign to
spend more time with family and friends.  “We have acquired an asset for our organization,”
Islanders General Manager  Garth Snow  said in a team release.
“This acquisition allows us flexibility with our roster moving
forward.”  It was not immediately clear whether Thomas, 38, who has
spent all eight of his NHL seasons in Boston and helped the
Bruins win the Stanley Cup in 2011, will play this season for
the Islanders.  The Islanders said they got the goalie in exchange for a
conditional second-round draft pick in 2014 or 2015.  Thomas, who helped lead the U.S. to the silver medal at the
2010 Vancouver Olympics, had one year left on a four-year, $20
million contract when he told the Bruins last June that he would
skip the 2012-13 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
