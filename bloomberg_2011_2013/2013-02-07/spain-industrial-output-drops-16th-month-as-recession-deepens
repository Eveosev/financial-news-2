Industrial output  in Spain, the euro
area’s fourth-largest economy, dropped for a 16th straight month
in December as spending cuts aggravated the country’s recession.  Output at factories, refineries and mines adjusted for the
number of working days fell 6.9 percent from a year earlier,
after declining a revised 7 percent in November, the National
Statistics Institute in Madrid said in an e-mailed statement
today. The figure matched a median of seven estimates in a
Bloomberg News  survey .  Spain’s economy is set to shrink for a second year in 2013,
with the International Monetary Fund predicting a 1.5 percent
contraction that may propel unemployment close to 27 percent.
The European Commission last month said it may recommend easing
fiscal goals as Spain, which is implementing the deepest budget
cuts in the nation’s democratic history, struggles to tackle a
deficit that is the second-largest in the euro region.  The country’s vehicle production and exports fell 16.6
percent in 2012, Spanish automobile organization ANFAC said on
Jan. 29. Carmaker  Seat  may cut as many as 740 jobs, La
Vanguardia reported last month.  In unadjusted terms, industrial production fell 8.5 percent
in December from a year earlier after a revised 7 percent in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
