President  Barack Obama ’s
administration won’t abandon the nation’s ethanol program and
will encourage Congress to maintain it, Agriculture Secretary
 Tom Vilsack  said.  The Renewable Fuels Standard, passed in 2007, requires the
U.S. to use 13.8 billion gallons of renewable fuels such as
ethanol this year and 15 billion gallons by 2015. The
Agriculture Department estimated this month that 42 percent of
this year’s corn crop will go toward making the fuel.  Last summer, lawmakers from both parties called for a
temporary suspension or reduction of the ethanol program as a
drought drove up corn prices. The Environmental Protection
Agency declined the requests.  “Our position is that we are strong supporters of he
RFS,” Vilsack said in an interview with reporters at the
National Ethanol Conference in Las Vegas. “It’s working. It’s
doing what it’s supposed to do. We would hope Congress will
continue to allow it to work.”  The industry allowed a 45-cent tax credit provided to
refiners for each gallon of the fuel blended into gasoline to
expire in December 2011, saying at the time the ethanol mandate
was sufficient to spur demand.  Denatured ethanol for March delivery fell 2.2 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.407 a gallon at 12:37 p.m. New York time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have jumped 9.9 percent this year
and 8.9 percent in the past year.  Corn Costs  Prices haven’t been robust enough to overcome higher corn
costs that topped $8.40 a bushel in intraday trading in August.
Corn for March delivery slipped 9 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$7.135 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, or the profit that can be made from
turning a bushel of corn into ethanol, was at minus 19 cents a
gallon versus minus 20 cents yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Production  fell to 770,000 barrels a day in the week ended
Jan. 25, or 11.8 billion gallons on an annualized basis, the EIA
report showed. That was the lowest level since weekly records
began in June 2010. The total rose to 774,000 last week.
Stockpiles are 20.1 million barrels, down from the record 22.7
million in March.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up 89 percent of the total
U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Feb. 1, up from 87 percent
a year earlier, according to the report.  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co ., in Decatur, Illinois, is the
biggest U.S. ethanol producer, followed by Poet LLC, in Sioux
Falls, South Dakota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
