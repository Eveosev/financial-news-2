Peru’s sol slipped to a nine-week low
after the central bank intervened to remove excess dollars from
the currency market as exporters pay taxes.  The sol fell less than 0.1 percent to 2.5780 per U.S.
dollar, the lowest close since Dec. 5, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency extended its drop this year
to 1 percent. The central bank said on its website it purchased
$120 million in U.S. currency today.  The monetary authority has bought $680 million this week,
the most since mid-January, as exporters convert greenbacks to
pay local taxes before an annual deadline in April.  “This is going to be a seasonal demand for soles that is
going to change after April,” said  Pedro Tuesta , a Washington-
based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc. “The seasonality is
always very strong in the first quarter.”  The central bank has increased its average daily purchases
to $97 million this quarter from $48 million in the previous
period to contain the sol. The sol has rallied 4.3 percent in
the past year, the most among six major Latin America currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  Expectations that Peru will keep borrowing costs on hold is
boosting demand for sol-denominated bonds, Tuesta said.  Policy makers meeting today will leave the target lending
rate at 4.25 percent for a 21st straight month, according to
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank is due to
announce its decision at 6 p.m. Lima time.  The yield on the benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due in August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.76 percent at 3:14 p.m. in Lima,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price climbed 0.13
centimo to 126.36 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
