HeidelbergCement AG , the world’s
third-largest maker of cement, reported fourth-quarter profit
and sales that beat analysts’ estimates as growth in North
America, higher prices and cost-cuts offset weakness in Europe.  Operating profit before depreciation rose 8.2 percent to
691 million euros ($934 million), the Heidelberg, Germany-based
company said in a statement today. The average estimate of 11
analysts in a Bloomberg  survey  was 644 million euros. Sales
jumped 6.5 percent to 3.5 billion euros, versus an estimated
3.42 billion euros.  As the demand for building materials declines in parts of
Europe, HeidelbergCement is pursuing 600 million euros in cost-
savings by the end of 2013. Reduced government spending in
Europe meant annual sales declined 2.8 percent to 4.2 billion
euros in the north and west of the continent, the company said.  “The higher savings are proof that they’ve got everything
under control,” said  Marc Gabriel , a Bielefeld, Germany-based
 Bankhaus Lampe  analyst who recommends buying HeidelbergCement
stock.  After beating its cuts target of 200 million euros last
year, making 384 million euros in efficiency savings, the
company has now raised the 2013 goal to 1.01 billion euros. It’s
also tackling a debt burden inflated by the 2007 takeover of
Hanson for more than $18 billion.  Full-year operating income before depreciation increased
6.7 percent to 2.5 billion euros, with revenue growing 8.7
percent to 14 billion euros.  Emerging Markets  “We are pleased that we achieved our goal of increasing
revenue and operating income, despite the negative impact of the
euro crisis on many countries in Europe,” Chief Executive
Officer  Bernd Scheifele  said in the statement. “Due to the
continuing strong economic growth in the emerging markets and
the recovery in the U.S., we are cautiously confident for the
future.”  HeidelbergCement attributed the sales decline in western
and northern Europe to lowered government spending on
infrastructure. While operating profit declined 21 percent to
577 million euros in the region, it grew 22 percent to 577
million euros in North America, 25 percent to 887 million euros
in the Asia-Pacific region and 24 percent to 203 million euros
in the Africa and Mediterranean basin region.  Scheifele said in November the company was targeting higher
revenue and operating profit for 2012, without being more
specific.  The world’s two biggest cement makers,  Lafarge SA  and
 Holcim Ltd. , are set to release their fourth-quarter reports on
Feb. 20 and Feb. 27 respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
