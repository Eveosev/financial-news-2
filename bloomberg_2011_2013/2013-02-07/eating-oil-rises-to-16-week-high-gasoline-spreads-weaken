Heating oil rose to the highest level
since October as seasonal refinery maintenance limits supplies.
Gasoline’s March-April spread weakened a sixth day.  Heating oil climbed 0.7 percent, and the March crack spread
widened $1.14 to $38.32 a barrel versus West Texas Intermediate
and 36 cents to $17.43 versus Brent. March gasoline’s discount
to April increased 0.9 cent to 19.14 cents a gallon. Supplies of
the motor fuel in the area around New York Harbor jumped 12
percent last week, government data show.  “When you look at the products side, there are refinery
issues and maintenance coming up,” said  Carl Larry , president
of Oil Outlooks & Opinions LLC in Houston.  Heating oil for March delivery rose 1.38 cents to $3.1996 a
gallon at 10:25 a.m. on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
volume 3.4 percent below the 100-day average for the time of
day.  Philadelphia Energy Solutions is performing work on the
Girard Point section of the 355,000-barrel-a-day plant, the
largest East Coast refinery.  Gasoline futures slipped 1.43 cents to $3.0254 a gallon.
Volume was 55 percent higher than average.  Gasoline at the pump , averaged nationwide, rose 0.9 cent to
$3.555 a gallon, AAA said on its website today. That’s the
highest price for gas at the pump since Oct. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
