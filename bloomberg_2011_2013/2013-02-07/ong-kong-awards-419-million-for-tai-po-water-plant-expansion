Hong Kong’s water supplies department
awarded a HK$3.25 billion ($419 million) contract, its largest
ever, to the China State-Atal joint venture to double the
capacity of Tai Po Water Treatment Works.  Completion of the Tai Po expansion, on Hong Kong’s east
coast, is scheduled for mid-2017. The facility will be able to
take up part of the Sha Tin Water Treatment Works’ load in
supplying fresh water “to a significant part of Kowloon and the
Central and Western districts on Hong Kong Island, thereby
enhancing the overall resilience, flexibility and reliability of
the water supply system in Hong Kong,” Ma Lee-tak, director of
water supplies, said yesterday in a statement.  Link to WSD statement:
