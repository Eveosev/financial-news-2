Eastern Europe will recover more
slowly than other emerging economies as the euro region’s
recession curtails export demand and bank funding, according to
Capital Economics Ltd.  Expansion in eastern Europe and Turkey will average 1.8
percent this year after an estimated 2.5 percent in 2012,
compared with 4.5 percent and 5 percent for all emerging
economies, Capital said today. The region will grow 2.5 percent
next year, half the emerging-market average, it said.  “Prospects look worst in emerging Europe, reflecting the
region’s close links to the stricken euro zone and limited room
for policy support,” economists led by Capital’s London-based
Managing Director  Roger Bootle  wrote in an e-mailed report.
Sluggish credit growth is also more of a concern than in other
emerging markets, they said.  The euro area, the biggest export destination and main
source of investment and bank financing for emerging Europe,
remains in recession. European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said today that even as low rates in the euro area should
help fuel growth later this year, risks to the economic outlook
remain on the downside.  Ukraine, Hungary and Turkey are among the most vulnerable
countries in terms of market turbulence in the event of Europe’s
debt crisis escalating, Capital said, citing their large
external financing needs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
