German bonds led gains in euro-area
government securities as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said inflation risks in the region are contained,
allowing monetary policy “to remain accommodative.”  Germany’s two- and five-year yields dropped to the lowest
level in two weeks as Draghi said the risk to economic growth in
the 17-nation bloc remains to the “downside.” ECB policy
makers kept the  benchmark refinancing rate  at a record-low 0.75
percent as predicted in a Bloomberg News survey. Spain’s bonds
rose as the country sold 4.61 billion euros ($6.18 billion) of
debt. Italian 10-year yields fell from an eight-week high.  “Draghi stressed in his prepared remarks that the ECB will
closely monitor liquidity conditions and that an accommodative
stance remains appropriate,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-
income strategist at Commerzbank AG in London. “This is the
verbal intervention the market was looking for and is positive
for German bonds.”  German five-year note yields fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 0.63 percent at 4:38 p.m. London time after
falling to 0.61 percent, the least since Jan. 25. The 0.5
percent security due in February 2018 rose 0.295, or 2.95 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.405.  Two-year rates fell four basis points to 0.18 percent,
after slipping to 0.16 percent, the lowest since Jan. 24. The
10-year yield slipped three basis points to 1.60 percent and the
rate on 30-year bunds was one basis point lower at 2.37 percent.  Yield Spread  Inflation risks are contained, allowing policy “to remain
accommodative,” and economic weakness will prevail only “in
the early part” of this year, Draghi said. “Later in 2013,
economic activity should gradually recover, supported by our
accommodative policy stance,” he said.  The extra yield, or  spread , that investors get for holding
10-year bunds instead of five-year notes increased to as much as
99 basis points, the most since Jan. 16. The widening gap
reflects greater demand for securities with shorter maturities,
which are more sensitive to the outlook for monetary policy.
Longer-dated debt is more sensitive to inflation expectations.  Euribor futures also advanced after Draghi said the central
bank will monitor money-market conditions as banks repay loans
taken under its so-called longer-term refinancing operations.  The implied yield on the contract expiring in December
dropped five basis points to 0.44 percent, after falling to 0.42
percent, the lowest since Jan. 25.  Spanish Yields  Spanish 10-year bond yields declined three basis points to
5.41 percent, after rising to 5.52 percent, the most since Dec.
11. Yields on similar-maturity Italian debt were little changed
at 4.57 percent, after climbing to 4.62 percent, the highest
since Dec. 14.  Spain sold securities maturing in 2015, 2018 and 2029
today. It allotted 2.07 billion euros of five-year notes at an
average yield of 4.12 percent, up from 3.77 percent at a
previous auction of the securities on Jan. 17.  “It’s a bit of a mixed picture,” said  Annalisa Piazza , a
fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in London. “The risks of
wider spreads are still quite high” amid elections in Italy
this month, she said.  While Spain issuing more than its 4.5 billion-euro maximum
target may be a positive sign, it may also indicate “that they
think in the next few weeks yields go even higher, so it’s
better to conduct funding needs at current levels,” she said.  Italian Bonds  The extra yield, or spread, that investors demand for
holding Italy’s 10-year securities instead of German bunds
increased to 300 basis points, the most since Jan. 2. The gap
has widened from 243 basis points on Jan. 25, the least since
July 22, 2011.  French borrowing costs rose as the nation sold 7.98 billion
euros of government debt.  The Paris-based treasury auctioned 3.02 billion euros of
10-year bonds at an average yield of 2.30 percent, compared with
2.07 percent at the previous sale on Jan. 3. It also sold 3.19
billion euros of 14-year securities and 1.77 billion euros of
seven-year notes.  France’s 10-year yield fell four basis points to 2.25
percent.  German bonds handed investors a loss of 1.5 percent this
year through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish debt returned 0.7 percent, while French
securities dropped 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
