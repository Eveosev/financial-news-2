Spain’s borrowing costs rose even as
it beat its maximum target of 4.5 billion euros ($6.11 billion)
at a debt sale today as corruption allegations targeting the
government threaten to reverse last month’s rally.  The Madrid-based Treasury sold a total of 4.61 billion
euros of debt, including a 2.75 percent 2015 note with a yield
of 2.823 percent, compared with 2.476 percent the last time it
was sold on Jan. 10. A 2018 note yielded 4.123 percent, up from
3.770 percent on Jan. 17, and it sold a 2029 bond at 5.787
percent, compared with 5.555 percent at its  last 15-year
benchmark bond sale  on Jan. 10.  The sovereign’s securities led declines among the euro-
region’s so-called peripheral countries this week even as German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  backed Premier  Mariano Rajoy  after he
denied receiving illegal cash payments. Demand for Spanish
assets is weakening as the Treasury seeks to fast-track a  higher
net issuance program  this year.  “The upper end of the target range wasn’t overshot
significantly showing that positive momentum for peripherals has
abated,”  Norbert Aul , a rates strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada in London said in a telephone interview. “We had a very
good start this year for peripheral funding and we see some
setback potential over the coming weeks even if it isn’t a full-
blown sell-off.”  Bond Demand  Demand for the 2015 note was 2.21 times the amount sold,
compared with 2.07 last month, while the bid-to-cover ratio was
2.24 for the 2018 one, compared with 2.32 in January, and 2.02
for the 2029 bonds from 2.85 last month.  The yield on Spain’s  10-year benchmark bond  fell 10 basis
points at 5.42 percent after the sale at 12:12 p.m. in Madrid,
narrowing the spread with similar German maturities to 3.77
percentage points.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year benchmark security has slumped
since a euro-era record of 7.75 percent on July 25, before the
 European Central Bank  unveiled a sovereign debt purchase program
on the secondary markets for member states applying for aid from
the European Union’s rescue-fund. ECB President  Mario Draghi 
speaks at 2:30 p.m. in Frankfurt today.  Corruption Concerns  Political parties and corruption were already among
Spaniards’ top four issues of concern along with unemployment
and the economic situation before the so-called Barcenas case
rocked the ruling People’s Party last month, a  poll  by the
state-run CIS showed yesterday.  The poll, based on 2.483 interviews, was conducted from
Jan. 4 to Jan. 14. before Spanish newspaper El Mundo first
published a story alleging former PP treasurer Luis Barcenas
made cash payments to senior party officials end of January.  The investigation “is likely to weaken the government’s
position,”  Ricardo Santos , a euro-area economist at BNP Paribas
SA in London, wrote in a note yesterday. “Reforms will be more
difficult to pass and implement, and the Spanish government will
be much more reticent when it comes to requesting financial
support.”  Investors may back off after a hunt for attractive yields
boosted sales of Spanish debt last month, Citigroup strategist
 Robert Crossley  wrote on Feb. 5. Pacific Investment Management
Co. Managing Director  Andrew Bosomworth  this week told Bloomberg
News that Rajoy’s battle to rebut the allegations is adding to
the risk of holding Spanish bonds.  In another interview, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
 Gary Cohn  said Europe still faces “fundamental problems” and
policy makers lack plans to foster economic growth in southern
European nations. Spain’s recession deepened in the last quarter
of 2012 and its economy is set to shrink a second year in 2013,
undermining the government’s efforts to reorder public finances
amid a 26 percent unemployment rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
