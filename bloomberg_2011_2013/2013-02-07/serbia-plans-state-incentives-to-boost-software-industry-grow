Serbia will offer incentives to
software companies to lure as many as 50,000 engineers after the
industry’s exports rose to 2.3 percent of all sales abroad.  The offer includes as much as 25,000 euros of grants for
startup projects, a 30-percent cut in health and unemployment
contributions and tax incentives for research and development,
Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  said in Belgrade today.  “Lower taxes and contributions are key for economic
recovery” and if the program proves successful, it could be
expanded to other industries, Dinkic told reporters today.  The industry, where 6,000 people have formal and an
estimated 50,000 informal employment, exported 200 million euros
($268 million) of software in 2012, Dinkic said.  In 2008 Serbia declared automotive, electronics and
information technologies industries as priority sectors for its
economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
