The group that reached a purchase
agreement last month to buy the Sacramento Kings took the next
step in bringing the National Basketball Association back to
Seattle by filing to relocate the team.  NBA Commissioner  David Stern  told reporters last night that
the “very strong” group, headed by Valiant Capital Management
founder  Chris Hansen  and including Microsoft Corp. Chief
Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer , submitted a relocation proposal
in which the team would play at KeyArena in Seattle for two or
three seasons while a new facility is built.  Seattle has been without an NBA team since 2008, when the
SuperSonics ended their 41-year stay by moving to Oklahoma City
and becoming the Thunder. That move followed a lack of public
support for a new venue to replace KeyArena, where the Sonics
played since their inception in 1967.  The prospective ownership group had to apply to the league
for relocation by March 1 to play in Seattle next season. That
request, as well as the sale agreement, would have to be
approved by the NBA’s board of governors, which is made up of
league owners.  Hansen’s group reached an agreement on Jan. 21 with the
Maloof family, which has owned the Kings since 1999, that puts
the team’s value at $525 million. It would be the highest sale
price for an NBA team, surpassing the $450 million paid for the
Golden State Warriors in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
