Manz AG , a German supplier of
equipment to the solar and flat-panel industries, rose the 
most in more than four months after announcing new orders valued 
at 56 million euros ($76 million) at its display unit.  The shares jumped as much as 12 percent to 23.28 euros, the
steepest intraday advance since Oct. 1. The stock traded up 9
percent as of 9:57 a.m. in Frankfurt as volume was almost double
the three-month daily average.  Manz, based in the southern town of Reutlingen, said the
orders by “established Asian suppliers to the electronics
industry” will boost revenue and earnings in the first half of
2013. It commented in a statement today. The company, which has
production and research sites in Taiwan and China, is gaining
tailwind from consumer demand for Apple Inc. products, said  Ingo Queiser , a Frankfurt-based analyst with Natureo Finance.  “Manz benefits a lot from the boom in tablets and
touchscreens as it makes the production equipment for those
devices,” said Queiser, who recommends buying the stock. Of
seven  analysts  who rate the shares, four recommend buying Manz,
while two have sell recommendations and one advises holding the
stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Manz has slumped about 86 percent over the last five years
compared with a 14 percent gain excluding dividends or coupons
in the  CDAX Performance Index , which tracks all companies listed
on the Frankfurt stock exchange, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
