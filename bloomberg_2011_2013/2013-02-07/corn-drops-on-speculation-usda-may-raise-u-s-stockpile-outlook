Corn declined for a fifth day, the
longest losing streak since December, on speculation that the
U.S. government will raise its estimate for stockpiles in the
country, the world’s largest shipper.  The contract for March delivery fell as much as 0.3 percent
to $7.2025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and was at
$7.2075 at 10:38 a.m. in Singapore. The most-active price
declined 2.4 percent in the four days to yesterday’s close.  Inventories  in the U.S. will probably total 616 million
bushels by Aug. 31, more than the 602 million predicted by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture last month, according to the
average estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
outlook on U.S. and world supplies will be updated tomorrow.  “No one really wants to hold a big position through the
USDA reports,”  Victor Thianpiriya , an analyst at Australia &
New Zealand  Banking Group Ltd., said from Singapore. “There is
obviously a risk that the USDA raises its estimate for carry-out
for corn,” he said, referring to U.S. supply left in warehouses
before the start of the next marketing year on Sept. 1.  Soybeans for March delivery fell as much as 0.6 percent to
$14.785 a bushel in Chicago and were at $14.7975. That put the
oilseed at 2.05 times the price of corn. Yesterday, the soybean-
corn  ratio  was at 2.0588, the highest level since Nov. 2.  Wheat for March delivery declined as much as 0.4 percent to
$7.5875 a bushel in Chicago and traded at $7.5975.  To contact the reporter on this story:
