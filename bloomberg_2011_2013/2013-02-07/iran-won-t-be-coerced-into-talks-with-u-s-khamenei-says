Iran won’t be coerced into holding
direct negotiations with the U.S. while being threatened and
simultaneously squeezed by Western sanctions, Supreme Leader
Ayatollah  Ali Khamenei  said.  “The U.S. holds a gun at Iran and says we need to
negotiate,” Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran and the
ultimate decision maker in the state’s affairs, said today at a
meeting of air force commanders. “They say the ball is in
Iran’s court. The ball is in your court, and you need to answer:
What is it worth to negotiate under threats and in the absence
of good intentions?”  Negotiations with the U.S. “won’t solve a thing,”
Khamenei was quoted as saying by the state-run Mehr news agency.
“Some are either naive or badly intentioned and they rejoice
over talks with the U.S.”  His remarks came as new U.S. financial restrictions against
Iran took effect yesterday and days after Vice President  Joe Biden  said at the Munich Security Conference the U.S. is ready
for direct talks with the Persian Gulf nation over its nuclear
program when the Iranian leader shows commitment to negotiate.  Iran, under investigation by the United Nations
International Atomic Energy Agency for a decade over alleged
nuclear-weapons research, says it only wants atomic technology
for peaceful purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
