India’s government will raise more
than 115 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) selling a stake in  NTPC
Ltd. , Disinvestment Secretary  Ravi Mathur  said, as demand
exceeded the number of shares on offer.  Investors bid for 1.33 billion shares of Asia’s second-
largest electricity generator by value, compared with 783.3
million on the block, according to data on the National Stock
Exchange  website  at the close of trading in Mumbai. The bids
came in at an average price of 145.91 rupees, compared with a
minimum price of 145 rupees, according to the data.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  plans to raise 300 billion
rupees this financial year through asset sales to narrow the
budget deficit and avoid a downgrade of the nation’s debt. The
government has raised almost a third of that target, after
selling 31.4 billion rupees of shares in  Oil India Ltd. , the
nation’s second-biggest explorer, last week.  NTPC  shares  fell 2.5 percent to 148.05 rupees, their fifth
consecutive day of losses. The stock has fallen 5.4 percent this
year, compared with a 0.8 percent gain in the benchmark
 Sensitive Index .  Open interest, or total number of contracts outstanding, in
NTCP’s February futures surged 73 percent to 16,116 at close,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Volumes in the contract more
than tripled from yesterday to 24,106. Some investors initiated
short positions, or bets prices will fall, on expectation the
stock will decline further to at least 145 rupees, Sharekhan
Ltd. analyst Abhinay Jain said by phone.  Permits Stay  NTPC, which plans to add 14,500 megawatts in the five years
ending March 31, 2017, may enhance the planned addition by 8,500
megawatts should the company get adequate coal supplies. NTPC
has a capacity of 39,674 megawatts.  A decision to cancel permits for three coal blocks allotted
to NTPC was reversed because of the “impending disinvestment”
in the company, the coal ministry said last month. The three
mines, located in the eastern state of Jharkhand, together hold
about 650 million metric tons of coal.  The government will sell stakes in four companies in the
year ending March 31, Mathur said. Shares may be sold in  Steel
Authority of India Ltd. , National Aluminium Co., Rashtriya
Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd. and commodities trader MMTC Ltd. to
help cut the budget deficit to 5.3 percent of gross domestic
product from 5.8 percent a year earlier. The government raised
train fares and diesel prices last month to help reduce the
shortfall.  India raised 58.3 billion rupees selling a 10 percent stake
in  NMDC Ltd. , India’s largest iron ore producer, in the third-
biggest share sale in India in 2012, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. A sale of shares in  Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  in
March 2012 brought the government 127.7 billion rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
