Boeing Co . will be permitted to
conduct additional test flights to speed efforts toward a
resolution of battery faults that grounded the 787 Dreamliner
fleet.  The test flights will be subject to restrictions, including
that they be conducted over unpopulated areas, the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration said in a statement today.  Investigators and Boeing are trying to determine what
caused a battery fire on a Japan Airlines Co. plane in Boston
and a cockpit warning that spurred an emergency landing in Japan
by an All Nippon Airways Co. 787 last month. Those incidents
triggered grounding orders worldwide starting Jan. 16.  The agency allowed Boeing to make one flight with a
Dreamliner today, under the condition that only the crew would
be on board, that special checks of the battery and system would
be performed, and that the aircraft would land immediately if
there were any indications of a battery fault.  The plane landed by Boeing’s wide-body factory in Everett,
Washington, after an “uneventful” flight, said  Marc Birtel , a
Boeing spokesman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
