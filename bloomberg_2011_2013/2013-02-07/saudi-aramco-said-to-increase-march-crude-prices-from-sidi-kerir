Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the worldâ€™s
largest crude exporter, raised its March official selling price
for Arab Light blend from the Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Saudi Aramco, as the state-run producer is known, narrowed
the discount of Arab Light to 10 cents a barrel less than the
Brent weighted average, or BWAVE, posted by the Intercontinental
Exchange, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the information is confidential. That compares with minus 75
cents for this month.  Aramco also increased the price of its Extra Light, Medium
and Heavy grades to a premium of $2.30, and discounts of $2.35
and $4.95 a barrel respectively to BWAVE, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
