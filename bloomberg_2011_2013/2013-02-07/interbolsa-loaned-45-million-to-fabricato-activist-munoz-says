Interbolsa SA , the financial firm
seized by the Colombian government after its brokerage collapsed
last year, had loaned more than 80 billion pesos ($45 million)
to an activist investor who was amassing shares in a textile
company, head liquidator Pablo Munoz said.  The investor, Alessandro Corridori, used part of the funds
to buy shares in the textile maker, Fabricato SA, Munoz said in
an  interview  today with CM& Television. Corridori was part of an
investor group trying to gain influence or control over
Medellin-based Fabricato, he said.  “The center of gravity of Interbolsa’s activities became
this reprehensible drive to take over Fabricato by any means,”
he said. Some of Corridori’s obligations are past due, Munoz
said.  Colombia said last month it would liquidate Bogota-based
Interbolsa after its brokerage, formerly the biggest in the
country, was seized by the government in November. Munoz was
named by regulators to lead the liquidation of the parent
company.  The outlook for Interbolsa creditors is “bleak” since
loans including Corridori’s will be hard to recover, Munoz said.
“There’s going to be a big hole here.”  Interbolsa held Fabricato shares, according to Fabricato
regulatory filings.  Munoz didn’t return a call for comment. Corridori didn’t
return an e-mail or call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
