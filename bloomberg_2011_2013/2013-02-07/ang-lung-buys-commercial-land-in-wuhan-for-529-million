Hang Lung Properties Ltd. , the Hong
Kong-based company investing more than $8.5 billion building
malls in mainland China, bought land in Wuhan for 3.3 billion
yuan ($529 million) for a mixed-used development.  The company plans to invest 12 billion yuan building a
shopping center, office towers and apartments with as much as
460,000 square meters (4.95 million square feet) of floor area,
according to a statement yesterday.  “We are delighted to have successfully acquired this prime
site in the city center of Wuhan at fair and reasonable
commercial terms,” Chairman  Ronnie Chan  said in the statement.
He called Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, “the largest
and most important city in central China.”  Chan is betting on rising consumption by China’s expanding
middle class to fuel demand for high-end shopping malls. Hang
Lung hasn’t purchased land in Hong Kong, the world’s most
expensive place to buy a home, in more than a decade and has
sold apartments and commercial properties in the city to help
fund expansion elsewhere in China.  Hang Lung last month reported that 2012 profit excluding
revaluation gains and deferred taxes almost doubled to HK$6.18
billion ($797 million). That beat the HK$4.79 billion average of
14 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company bought the 82,637-square-meter site in the
Qiaokou district from the Wuhan Land Resources and Planning
Bureau, a government agency, according to a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing yesterday. The company paid 1.1 billion yuan on
Jan. 29 and must pay the balance within 90 days of entering a
development and compensation agreement.  Hang Lung announced the purchase after Hong Kong’s stock
market closed yesterday. The  shares  gained 1.7 percent to
HK$30.05. They have declined 2.4 percent this year, as the
benchmark Hang Seng Index has climbed 2.3 percent.  Hang Lung Group Ltd., the developer’s parent, rose
1.2 percent to HK$47.55 in Hong Kong yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
