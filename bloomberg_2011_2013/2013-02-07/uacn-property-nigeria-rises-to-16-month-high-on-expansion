UACN Property Development Co ., a
Nigerian company that develops and manages real estate, rose to
the highest in 16 months after it started raising funds for
business expansion.  The stock advanced 0.9 percent to 16.35 naira at the close
in Lagos, the commercial capital, the highest level since Sept.
15, 2011.  UACN Property plans to raise 30 billion naira ($190
million) through a share offer for real estate investments from
Feb. 21 to April 1, the company said yesterday.  “Investors want to take advantage of the property market
that has survived a slump, with properties gaining in key
commercial areas of Lagos, the capital Abuja and Port Harcourt
by as much as 40 percent in the past one year,” Toyin
Oluwatuyi, analyst with Lagos-based Sterling Capital Ltd., said
in a telephone interview from Lagos. “The huge housing deficit
in the country gives the stock good earnings prospects.”  The company’s shares have risen 38.6 percent this year,
compared with a 18.6 percent advance in the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
