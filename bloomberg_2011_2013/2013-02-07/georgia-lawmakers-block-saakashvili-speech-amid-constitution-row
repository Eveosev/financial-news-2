Georgian lawmakers allied with Prime
Minister  Bidzina Ivanishvili  prevented President  Mikheil Saakashvili  from giving his state-of-the-nation address as the
two sides squabble over constitutional changes.  Saakashvili won’t be able to deliver his speech until his
party agrees to back constitutional changes that would remove
the president’s right to fire the government, Parliamentary
Speaker Davit Usufashvili told the television station Rustavi 2
today from Kutaisi, the seat of the legislature 230 kilometers
(143 miles) west of the capital, Tbilisi.  Saakashvili’s spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze confirmed by
phone that the president’s trip to Kutaisi has been canceled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
