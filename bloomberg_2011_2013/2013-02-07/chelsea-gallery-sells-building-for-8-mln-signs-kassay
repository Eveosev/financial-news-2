Lisa Spellman , the owner of 303
Gallery in Manhattan’s West Chelsea contemporary art hub, has
sold the gallery’s home for about $8 million to real-estate
developer Scott Resnick, according to a filing with the New York
City Department of Finance.  The gallery, on W. 21st Street, will move back to the site
“in 2015 to anchor the first two floors of a new high-rise
development” from Resnick, according to Spellman.  Resnick’s company, SR Capital, filed plans for a 19-story
residential tower on the corner of 11th Avenue and 21st Street,
The Real Deal reported last month.  The development is to include 44 apartments and about 9,000
square feet of commercial space, according to the plans.  Spellman declined to comment on the sale price. In an e-
mail, she wrote that “we will own the first two floors of the
new building.”  Resnick didn’t return a call seeking comment.  Spellman also said she had signed 28-year-old artist Jacob
Kassay, whose works are currently on view at the Kitchen in
Chelsea.  Prices for Kassay’s silver-surfaced paintings surged at
auction since 2010, with a record of $290,500 achieved at
Phillips de Pury in May, 2011. He was initially represented in
New York by  Eleven Rivington gallery  on the Lower East Side. In
2010, his works sold on the primary market for $10,000 to
$20,000.  “We are very excited to represent Jacob,” Spellman said
in an e-mail. “I have been a fan for a long time.”  Spellman’s 303 Gallery, which opened in 1984, represents 25
artists, including  Doug Aitken , Mary Heilmann and  Karen Kilimnik .  During the construction period, the gallery will move to W.
24th Street, where it will take over a new, two-level space
underneath the High Line. The site was also developed by
Resnick, according to Spellman.  Muse highlights include  Jason Harper  on cars,  Martin
Gayford  on European art,  Lance Esplund  on U.S. art and  Catherine
Hickley  on German film.  To contact the reporter on this story:
