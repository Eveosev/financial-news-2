Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
Shanghai traded near the highest in nine months, supported by
higher costs for inputs including iron ore.  Rebar for delivery in October was little changed at 4,219
yuan ($677) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange at
10:14 a.m. local time. The most-active contract on the bourse
rose to the highest since May earlier this week.  Iron ore for immediate delivery rose for the fifth day
yesterday by 0.6 percent to $155.10 a ton, according to a price
index compiled by The Steel Index Ltd. Trading in iron ore
tripled last month from a year earlier on speculation of
increased demand this month after week-long holidays in China,
the company said.  “Rebar prices are supported by high production costs, as
raw material prices are sustained at high levels,” Dang Man,
analyst at Maike Futures Co., said in a report today.  The average spot  price  for rebar was little changed
yesterday at 3,790 yuan a ton, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co. China’s markets will be
closed all of next week for the Lunar New Year holidays.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
