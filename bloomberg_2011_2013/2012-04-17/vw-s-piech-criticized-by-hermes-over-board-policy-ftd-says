Ferdinand Piech , the head of
 Volkswagen AG’s (VOW3)  supervisory board, was criticized for the
composition of the automaker’s board by investment firm Hermes,
the Financial Times Deutschland  said , citing a letter from
Hermes manager Hans-Christoph Hirt.  Hirt alleges in the letter that VW doesn’t have enough
independent board members and says  Hermes  won’t support the
slate of board candidates to be proposed at the company’s annual
general meeting on April 19, the newspaper said in an advance
copy of an article for tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
