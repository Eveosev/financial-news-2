Boeing Co. (BA)  awarded a contract
valued at $1 billion over 10 years to Mubadala Aerospace’s
composite aerostructures unit, which will produce aircraft
parts, as the  Middle East  expands its role as an aviation hub.  The parts will be made at the Strata Manufacturing site in
Al Ain, the companies said in a joint-statement today. Strata, a
subsidiary of the Mubadala investment fund in Abu Dhabi, will
make empennage ribs for the 777 and vertical fin ribs for the
787 Dreamliner, and deliveries will start in 2013.  The deal is “comparative to the existing deal with Airbus
which is in the range of $1 billion,” Mubadala Aerospace
Executive Director Homaid al-Shemmari told reporters in  Abu
Dhabi  today.  Abu Dhabi, home to about 7 percent of the world’s proven
oil reserves, is branching out into aerospace as the  United Arab
Emirates ’ biggest carriers, Emirates and Etihad, beef up their
fleets to funnel travelers through the Middle East. Emirates is
the biggest customer of Airbus A380 aircraft, and the company
ordered more 777 wide-body jets at the Dubai Air show last year
as it expands its global network.  Boeing and Mubadala may in future cooperate on “military
maintenance and sustainment activities, as well as pilot
training and people development,” according to the statement.
Strata already manufactures composite parts for Airbus SAS 330
wide-body jet at its factory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
