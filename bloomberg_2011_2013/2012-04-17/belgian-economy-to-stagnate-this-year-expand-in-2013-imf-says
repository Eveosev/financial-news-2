Belgium ’s economy will stagnate
this year and return to growth in 2013, the International
Monetary Fund said.  The IMF raised its 2012 outlook from last month’s forecast
of a 0.1 percent contraction. The Washington-based lender
maintained its projection of 0.8 percent growth in 2013,
according to its World Economic Outlook, published today.  Belgium’s inflation rate will fall to 2.4 percent this year
and 1.9 percent in 2013, according to the IMF report. The
country will post a current-account deficit equivalent to 0.3
percent of gross domestic product in 2012 and a surplus of 0.4
percent of GDP next year, while the unemployment rate will rise
to 8 percent and 8.3 percent, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
