Germany ’s Free Democratic Party,
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s coalition ally, may give up its goal
to cut income tax by 6 billion euros ($8 billion) from 2013,
 Bild Zeitung  reported, citing FDP party leaders it didn’t
identify.  Should the opposition Social Democrats and Greens block the
government’s planned tax cut bill in the upper house of
parliament, the FDP will seek to use the revenue to achieve a
balanced federal budget in 2014, Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
