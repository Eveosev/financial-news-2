Thailand ’s baht was little changed
near its strongest level in two weeks as speculation exporters
will convert earnings countered stock sales by global funds.  Overseas shipments from  Southeast Asia ’s second-biggest
economy rose 0.9 percent from a year earlier in February after
three months of declines, according to government data. Global
funds sold $143 million more Thai equities than they bought last
week, exchange data show.  “The current level isn’t bad for exporters and their
dollar sales will provide some support for the baht,” said
 Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center for Economic
Research in  Tokyo . “With local stocks seeing some selling by
overseas investors, the baht will remain slightly under
pressure.”  The baht traded at 30.81 per dollar as of 8:36 a.m. in
Bangkok, compared with 30.82 on April 12, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Local financial markets were shut on
April 13 and April 16 for public holidays.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 4.52 percent.  The yield on the 3.25 percent government bonds due June
2017 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.63
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
