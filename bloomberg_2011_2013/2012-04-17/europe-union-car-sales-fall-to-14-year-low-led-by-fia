European car sales fell to a 14-
year low last month, with  Fiat SpA (F) ,  Renault SA (RNO)  and  PSA Peugeot
Citroen (UG)  posting the biggest drops, as the region’s sovereign-
debt crisis caused economic growth to stall.  Registrations in the 27-member European Union plus
Switzerland, Norway and Iceland fell 6.6 percent from a year
earlier to 1.5 million vehicles, the lowest figure for March
since 1998, the Brussels-based  European Automobile
Manufacturers’ Association  said today in a statement. First-
quarter sales dropped 7.3 percent to 3.43 million vehicles.  France  and Italy, Europe’s second- and third-biggest auto
markets, shrank by more than 20 percent. The regional drop was
alleviated by growth at German carmakers, such as  Volkswagen AG. (VOW) 
Paris-based Peugeot is among auto manufacturers forecasting an
industrywide contraction of 5 percent in  Europe  this year.  “The extent of the beat for Germans is a bit surprising,
as well as the extent of the downturn for the French,” Adam Hull, a London-based analyst at WestLB AG, said by phone.  French car sales plummeted 23 percent to 197,774 vehicles,
while Italian registrations dropped 27 percent to 138,137,
according to the association, or ACEA. Countries reporting sales
increases included  Germany , the region’s largest car market,
with a 3.4 percent gain,  Poland  with 8.6 percent growth and
 Romania  with a 29 percent jump.  Strike Hurts Fiat  European sales at Fiat, Italy’s largest vehicle
manufacturer, tumbled 26 percent to 81,469 cars, according to
the ACEA. Deliveries were hampered by a truckers’ strike in the
country, Turin-based Fiat said today in an e-mail.  Peugeot, Europe’s second-biggest automaker after
Volkswagen, reported a 19 percent sales drop in the region to
165,118 vehicles. The carmaker announced a broad alliance with
 General Motors Co. (GM)  on Feb. 29 that will include joint purchasing
and vehicle development in an effort to revitalize their
European operations.  Renault, France’s second-ranked carmaker after Peugeot,
posted a 20 percent decline in European sales to 112,894 units.
Sales in the region by  Ford Motor Co. (F)  fell 7.6 percent to
131,410 vehicles, while Detroit-based GM, the world’s biggest
carmaker, posted a 10 percent European registration drop to
129,912.  Volkswagen’s European sales gained 1.7 percent in March to
352,455 vehicles, while registrations increased 3.2 percent to
93,313 at Munich-based  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  and 5.1
percent to 73,899 at Stuttgart-based  Daimler AG. (DAI)   Fiat  fell  as much as 2.4 percent to 3.93 euros and was
trading down 0.9 percent at 10:55 a.m. in Milan. Peugeot dropped
2.4 percent to 9.60 euros and Renault declined 0.5 percent to
35.80 euros in Paris.  To contact the reporter on this story:
