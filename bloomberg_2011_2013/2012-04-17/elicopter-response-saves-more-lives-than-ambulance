Trauma patients with life-
threatening injuries have a better chance of surviving if they
are taken to the hospital by helicopter rather than ambulance, a
study found.  Seriously injured patients are 16 percent more likely to
survive and be discharged from the hospital if the helicopter is
used for emergency transportation, research today in the  Journal
of the American Medical Association  showed. It’s unclear why the
flights save more lives, though speed doesn’t seem to be the
answer because the transport time was similar in many cases,
said  Adil Haider , the study author.  “What we really need to do is figure out who are those
severely injured patients who could benefit,” said Haider, an
associate professor of surgery, anesthesiology and critical care
medicine at the  Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine  in
Baltimore, in an April 13 telephone interview. “We just need to
make sure that the helicopters are getting to the people who
need it the most. These helicopters are saving lives.”  More than 50 million people are injured in the U.S. each
year and more than 169,000 die of their injuries, the authors
wrote. Helicopter flights cost from $5,000 to $10,000, while the
expense of an ambulance trip is $500 to $1,500, Haider said.  The data showed about $350,000 would have to be spent in
helicopter transportation to save one life, about the same cost
as needed to save one patient using open-heart surgery, he said.  National Data Bank  In the study, the researchers looked at the records of more
than 223,475 patients ages 16 and older who were in the  National
Trauma Data Bank . Those in the study had at least moderately
severe injuries and were taken to trauma hospitals. Of those,
61,909 were transported by helicopter and 161,566 were
transported by ambulance.  The study found that 7,813 patients transported by
helicopter died compared with 17,775 of those taken by ground
services. Many of those who traveled by helicopter had more
severe injuries. When researchers culled the data to compare
patients with similar injuries who were taken to trauma centers,
“helicopter transport was associated with an improved odds of
survival,” they wrote.  While the study showed helicopters didn’t travel any faster
than ambulances in many cases, they may carry the most-advanced
equipment and their patients may receive more intensive
treatment once they land, Haider said.  “This study does a very good job of reinforcing what some
of the other recent studies have shown, that helicopters do make
a difference in severely injured patients,” said  Mark Gestring ,
medical director of the Kessler Trauma Center at the University
of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester,  New York , who wasn’t
an author of today’s study.  “It sets the stage for the next question, how do you
decide which injured patients fly and which don’t need to,”
said Gestring, who wrote a  paper  last year looking at the
benefits of helicopter transportation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
