(Corrects designation in first paragraph.)  Devendra Pant, a director at  Fitch
Ratings  in New Delhi, comments after India’s central bank
reduced  interest rates  for the first time since 2009. Pant spoke
today in a telephone interview.  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao lowered the repurchase rate to 8
percent from 8.5 percent, the  Reserve Bank  of India said in a
statement in Mumbai today. The outcome was predicted by three of
25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Seventeen expected a
0.25 percentage-point cut and the rest predicted no change.  On growth prospects:  “At present, any kind of fiscal prudence can only come
from high tax revenue, which will happen if growth is supported.
By lowering the rates by 0.5 percentage points, the central bank
has indicated it’s hoping investments will come back in the form
of capital expenditure by the corporate sector as well as the
regular and pent-up demand in all sectors impacted by higher
rates like automobiles, homes.”  On inflation:  “While current  core inflation  has moderated, it is still a
concern. Food inflation is high and that can only be controlled
if the supply side is augmented. You can’t contain prices of
poultry products or pulses by raising rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
