Prasanna Ananthasubramanian, chief
economist at Mumbai-based ICICI Securities Primary Dealership
Ltd., comments on the  Reserve Bank  of India’s decision to cut
 interest rates  for the first time since 2009.  The central bank slashed the  repurchase  rate by a greater-
than-forecast half a percentage point to 8 percent, from 8.5
percent, at the annual policy review today.  “It is a surprise. It seems they have taken a lot of
comfort from the fall in  core inflation  so they have decided
that growth concerns are more important at this point of time.
Since they have taken such a big step, I expect RBI not to move
on rates for the next six months.  ‘‘Further rate action can only be expected in the second
half of the financial year and a key precondition for that will
be that the government puts in place some measures to cap
subsidies. And that we should expect in the next two months,
once the budget session of parliament ends, and based on how
that pans out, RBI may decide on rate cuts in the second half.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
