The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
which operates the only crude export pipe in  Russia  with foreign
shareholders, will cut daily oil exports for May from the  Black
Sea  by 6 percent from this month, according to a preliminary
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 23 cargoes totaling
2.419 million metric tons in May, the schedule showed. That’s
equivalent to 18.8 million barrels, or 606,311 barrels a day,
compared with 645,221 barrels for April.  The CPC pipeline, in which Chevron Corp. is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from  Kazakhstan ’s western fields to the terminal close to
Russia’s Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Russia owns 31
percent while Kazakhstan owns 20.75 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp.,
OAO Lukoil and a joint venture between OAO Rosneft and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc are among other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
