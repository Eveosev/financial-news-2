European stocks  rallied the most
this year as demand increased at a Spanish debt sale, German
investor confidence topped forecasts and the International
Monetary Fund boosted its global growth outlook.  Banks contributed the most to the Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s
advance as  Banco Popolare SC (BP)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  climbed. Danone
rose 2.9 percent as the world’s biggest yogurt maker reported
higher first-quarter  sales .  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  plunged 6.1 percent as
Argentina took control of the Spanish company’s YPF unit
following a dispute over slumping oil output and investments.  The Stoxx 600 gained 2 percent to 259.45 at the close of
trading, the biggest jump since Dec. 20. The benchmark index has
 climbed 6.1 percent this year  as the  European Central Bank 
flooded financial markets with 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion)
of cheap loans for three years to ease credit. ECB Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said late yesterday that he doesn’t
see an “immediate need” for an extension of the measures,
known as the longer-term refinancing operation, or LTRO.  “The Spanish debt auction today shows there is still
liquidity in the market,” said Witold Bahrke, a senior
strategist at PFA Pension A/S in Copenhagen, where he helps
oversee $55 billion. “We’ve cleared some smaller tests on
sentiment surrounding the euro area ahead of the real tests late
in the week when France and Spain sells debt maturing later than
the LTRO’s.”  National benchmark indexes advanced in all of the 18
western European markets. France’s CAC 40 and Germany’s DAX rose
2.7 percent while the U.K.’s  FTSE 100 (UKX)  added 1.8 percent.  Spain Auction  Spain sold 3.18 billion euros of bills today, compared with
a maximum target of 3 billion euros the Treasury set for the
sale. The average 12-month yield was 2.623 percent, compared
with 1.418 percent at the last auction on March 20, the Bank of
Spain said. The Treasury also sold 18-month bills at 3.11
percent, compared with 1.71 percent last month.  Demand for the 12-month bills was 2.9 times the amount
sold, compared with 2.14 times last month. Demand for the longer
maturity notes rose to 3.77 times from 2.93. Spain will sell 10-
year bonds on April 19 and France will auction securities
maturing between 2014 and 2018.  German investor confidence unexpectedly rose for a fifth
month in April to the highest in almost two years, suggesting
Europe’s largest economy can weather the resurgent debt crisis
in the euro region’s periphery. The ZEW Center for European
Economic Research’s  index of investor and analyst expectations ,
which aims to predict economic developments six months in
advance, climbed to 23.4 from 22.3 in March.  ‘Macro Risk’  “Better-than-expected reports are allowing for a reduction
in some of the macro risk we’ve seen over the last couple of
sessions, and will give room to shareholders to focus on the
strong micro fundamentals,” said  Henk Potts , an equity
strategist at Barclays Wealth in London, which oversees $239
billion.  The world economy will expand 3.5 percent this year and 4.1
percent in 2013, the Washington-based IMF said today in its
World Economic Outlook, raising forecasts made in January from
3.3 percent for 2012 and 4 percent for next year.  A gauge of bank shares gained 4 percent today as Banco
Popolare, Italy’s fifth-largest lender, increased 9.3 percent to
1.16 euros. Barclays, the U.K.’s second-biggest bank by assets,
increased 4.6 percent to 220.55 pence.  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , France’s
largest bank, rallied 6.9 percent to 30.99 euros and  Societe
Generale SA (GLE) , the country’s second-biggest lender, rose 8.6
percent to 18.57 euros.  Greek Banks  Greek banks jumped amid optimism the government is close to
completing its plans to restructure the country’s banks. Prime
Minister  Lucas Papademos  has said terms of bank
recapitalizations must be agreed upon before national elections
are held on May 6.  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB)  surged 7.3 percent
to 71.9 euro cents and Alpha Bank SA climbed 6.2 percent to 1.20
euros.  “Volatility remains high as there is a lot of speculation
about the recapitalization terms, while the involved parties are
looking for ways to reduce the eventual recapitalization
needs,” Panagiotis Kladis, an analyst at Athens-based National
Securities, said in a note to clients today.  Danone (BN)  advanced 2.9 percent to 53.08 euros after reporting
higher first-quarter  sales , led by bottled water and baby food.
Revenue rose to 5.12 billion euros from 4.76 billion euros a
year earlier, the company said. That beat the 5.05 billion-euro
average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Sky Soccer Rights  Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD)  gained 7 percent to 2.15 euros. The
broadcaster beat rivals in an auction of broadcasting rights for
Germany’s Bundesliga soccer matches, expanding its license to
show the country’s most watched sports through 2017.  Afren Plc (AFR)  surged 6.3 percent to 143 pence as the company
reported a “significant” oil discovery in the Kurdistan region
of Iraq. The Simrit-2 exploration well encountered an estimated
409 meters of net oil pay.  Aker Solutions ASA (AKSO) , Norway’s biggest maker of oil
platforms, jumped 7.4 percent to 96.40 kroner. The company won a
$1.9 billion rig contract from Statoil ASA.  Repsol,  Spain’s largest oil company , plunged 6.1 percent to
16.42 euros. The Spanish government pledged to take “decisive”
action against Argentina within days, after President  Cristina
Fernandez de Kirchner  seized YPF, the Argentine  oil company 
majority-owned by Repsol. Fernandez took control of Argentina’s
largest crude producer late yesterday, replacing Chief Executive
Officer Sebastian Eskenazi with Planning Minister Julio De Vido.  M&S, Burberry  Marks & Spencer Group Plc (MKS)  slid 2.5 percent to 358.7 pence.
The U.K.’s largest clothing retailer said sales of general
merchandise at U.K. stores open at least a year fell 2.8 percent
in the 13 weeks ended March 31. The average estimate of 10
analysts was for an unchanged performance.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  sank 5.9 percent to 1,492 pence, the
largest drop since October. The U.K.’s largest luxury-goods
maker reported fiscal fourth-quarter sales that trailed
analysts’ estimates and said it remains vigilant as Europe’s
economy slows.  Wincor Nixdorf AG (WIN)  lost 10 percent to 30.36 euros, for the
worst performance in the  Stoxx 600. (SXXP)  The maker of banking
machines and cash registers said that it sees “significant”
reduction in full-year operating profit, citing a “continued
and substantial” decline in banking sales and pressure on
margins in hardware.  To contact the reporter on this story:
