Canada ’s dollar rose for a second
day against its U.S. counterpart after Spain sold more than its
maximum target at a bill auction, reducing European sovereign-
debt-crisis concern and boosting demand for riskier assets.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, advanced before a  Bank of Canada 
meeting where policy makers are forecast to leave the  interest
rate  unchanged at 1 percent. Global stocks and commodities
strengthened, increasing appetite for higher-yielding
currencies.  “We’re seeing some Canadian dollar strength on the back of
a rebound in risk appetite across the markets,” said Matthew Perrier, Toronto-based director of foreign exchange at Bank of
Montreal. “We’ve got the Bank of Canada policy announcement
later this morning. We’re not expecting any move on interest
rates, but we’ll be paying close attention to the statement to
see if there’s any hawkish intonation.”  The Canadian currency rose 0.3 percent to 99.67 Canadian
cents per  U.S. dollar  at 7:54 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0033.  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of equities added 0.4 percent and
crude oil advanced 0.7 percent to $103.64. Oil is Canada’s
largest export.  Demand for Spanish 12-month bills was 2.9 times the amount
sold, compared with 2.14 times last month, Bank of Spain data
today showed. The bid-to-cover for the longer maturity notes was
3.77, compared with 2.93 on March 20. The  yield  on the 10-year
bond slid 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 5.92
percent, after rising yesterday to 6.16 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
