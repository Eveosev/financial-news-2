Mumias Sugar Co.,  Kenya ’s biggest
maker of the sweetener, rose for a third day after the company
named its finance director as the new chief executive officer.  The shares climbed as much as 8.3 percent and traded 4.2
percent higher at 5 shillings by the close in Nairobi, the
highest level since Feb. 8.  “The key concern from local fund managers had been
succession,” Francis Mwangi, head of research at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.
The appointment of somebody with long experience of the company
“creates clarity that the succession will be smooth, that is
what is driving the price right now,” Mwangi said.  Peter Kebati, who joined the company in April 2003, will
take over from Evans Kidero on July 1, Mumias said on its
website in a statement dated April 16. Kidero will leave the
company at the end of its financial year in June, according to
the statement.  Kidero is leaving the company to go into politics, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
