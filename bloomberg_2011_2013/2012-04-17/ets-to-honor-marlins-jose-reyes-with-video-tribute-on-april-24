The Mets will honor former
shortstop  Jose Reyes ’s nine seasons in  New York  with a video
tribute prior to their April 24 game at Citi Field against his
new team, the Miami Marlins.  Reyes, 28, signed with the Marlins as a free agent in
December, less than three months after he won the first batting
title in the Mets’ 50-year history. He’ll return to New York as
the Marlins visit for a three-game series April 24-26.  Reyes’s time with the Mets will be acknowledged with the
video, team spokesman  Jay Horwitz  said in an e-mail.  The four-time All-Star had a .292 batting average with the
Mets, while scoring 735 runs and stealing 370 bases. Reyes, who
originally signed with the Mets as an amateur free agent out of
the  Dominican Republic  in 1999, was one of the club’s most
popular players and led the National League in steals three
times and in triples four times while in New York.  His contract is worth at least $111 million over six years,
ESPN reported in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
