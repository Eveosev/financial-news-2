Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , Poland’s second-
largest refiner, jumped to a 7 1/2-month high after oil climbed
as a Spanish bond auction eased concern that Europe’s credit
crisis will spread and slow economic growth.  The shares surged 4.5 percent to 30.1 zloty by 4:50 p.m. in
Warsaw, the highest intraday level since Sept. 1.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN) ,
the country’s biggest oil company, climbed 4 percent to 38.19
zloty, the steepest advance since Jan. 17.  Oil rose 1.8 percent in New York as Spain raised more than
its maximum target at a debt sale and the International Monetary
Fund lifted its global growth forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
