Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  rose the most in a
month in  New York  trading as Auriga USA raised its rating to buy
from hold, saying China’s third-biggest maker of solar panels is
controlling costs better than its competitors.  American depositary receipts of Changzhou, China-based
Trina surged 7.3 percent to $6.87, a two-week high, at the close
of trading in New York. It was the biggest intraday gain since
March 20.  Trina will return to  profitability  in the fourth quarter as
the company benefits from efforts to reduce costs, Hari Chandra Polavarapu, an analyst at Auriga USA in New York, said in a
phone interview. Trina will also benefit as solar makers cut
production and are either merged or acquired over the next year,
he added.  “In an environment of consolidation and reduced capacity,
cost leaders with good balance sheets will thrive, and that’s
where  Trina Solar  fits in,” Chandra Polavarapu said.  Tempe, Arizona-based  First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the largest thin-
film panel maker, said it will cut 30 percent of its workforce,
about 2,000 jobs, and close factories in Germany and Malaysia in
response to a deteriorating European market. First Solar jumped
10 percent to $22.96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
