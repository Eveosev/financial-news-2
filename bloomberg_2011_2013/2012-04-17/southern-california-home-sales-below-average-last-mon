Fewer than 20,000 homes sold in
 Southern California  last month, less than average for March, as
potential buyers stayed on the sidelines amid a slow economic
recovery,  DataQuick  reported today.  A total of 19,953 houses and condominiums sold in  Los
Angeles , Riverside, San Diego, Ventura, San Bernardino and
Orange counties, the San Diego-based data seller said in a
statement. While last month’s sales total was up 2.8 percent
from a year earlier, it was almost 19 percent below the average
for March since 1988, when DataQuick began tracking the figures.  “The year is young and lots could still change, but the
results from the first big sales month of 2012 suggest the
market is stuck in low gear,” DataQuick President  John Walsh 
said in the statement. “This remains a very gradual -- not to
mention fragile -- recovery.”  The median price paid for a home in Southern California was
$280,000 last month, up 5.8 percent from $264,750 in February
and down 0.2 percent from $280,500 in March 2011. While the
median was the highest in six months, many challenges confront
the market, Walsh said.  “For many potential buyers, lower prices and amazingly low
mortgage rates still aren’t enough to get them over their
hurdles: tight credit, home values below what they owe on their
mortgages, and uncertainties over the economy and  home prices ,”
Walsh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
