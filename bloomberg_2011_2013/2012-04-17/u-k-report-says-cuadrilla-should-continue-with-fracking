An independent expert report
recommended that Cuadrilla Resources Ltd. should be allowed to

assessed prior to starting, the report by the Department of
Energy and Climate Change said.  Cuadrilla suspended fracking operations after they caused
two small earthquakes last year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
