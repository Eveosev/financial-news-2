Duff Beer UG , a German beer maker,
asked a European Union court to allow it to register an EU
trademark for Homer Simpson’s favorite beverage.  The brewer sells “the legendary Duff beer” without
mentioning the Simpsons on its packaging or its website.  News
Corp. (NWSA) ’s Twentieth Century Fox Film, which makes the long-running
cartoon show “The Simpsons,” has two earlier EU trademarks to
the fictional beer. News Corp. won an Australian court case
stopping another producer selling Duff beer in 1996.  Duff Beer, based in Eschwege,  Germany , filed a suit with
the EU’s general court in Luxembourg, asking the court to
overturn a decision by the EU trademark agency that prevented it
from registering “the figurative trademark ‘Duff’ in black,
white and red,” according to a  filing  published on April 14.  A Belgian court last year annulled Twentieth Century Fox’s
two European trademarks for Duff as misleading because they
weren’t registered for an actual beverage. Duff Beer is also
asking the EU court to wait for final decisions from the Belgian
cases.  Duff Beer’s offices in Eschweg and Chris Petrikin, a
spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox in  Los Angeles , didn’t
respond to e-mails and calls seeking comment.  The case is T-87/12 - Duff Beer v OHIM, Twentieth Century
Fox Film (Duff)  To contact the reporter on this story:
