Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K. explorer that
operates in Africa and the  Middle East , jumped to a 9-month high
in London after reporting a “significant” oil discovery in the
Kurdistan region of Iraq.  Afren  climbed  as much as 11 percent to 149.70 pence, the
highest since July, and traded at 144 pence at 9:14 a.m. U.K.
time. The shares have surged 68 percent this year.  The Simrit-2 exploration well on the Ain Sifni block
encountered an estimated 409 meters (1,342 feet) of net oil pay,
the London-based company said today in a statement.  The results suggest the Ain Sifni block has the potential
to be “transformational for Afren,” Chief Executive Officer
Osman Shahenshah said in the statement.  Afren has a 20 percent interest in the block and Hunt Oil
Co. is the operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
