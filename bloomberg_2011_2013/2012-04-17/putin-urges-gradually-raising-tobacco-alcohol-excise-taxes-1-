Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  said
the government should gradually raise excise taxes on alcohol
and tobacco, coordinating measures to curb their harmful effects
with  Russia ’s customs union partners Kazakhstan and Belarus.  “We have to raise them, of course, but very carefully,
calmly,” Putin, who won a six-year term in the Kremlin in the
March 4 presidential election, said at a government meeting in
Moscow today. Sharp increases won’t “solve all our tasks,” he
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
