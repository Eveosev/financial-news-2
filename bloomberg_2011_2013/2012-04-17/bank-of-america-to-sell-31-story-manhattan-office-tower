Bank of America Corp.  agreed to
sell a 31-story  office tower  at 222 Broadway to Beacon Capital
Partners LLC and L&L Holding Co.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank will lease about
590,000 square feet (54,800 square meters) at the building
following the sale, said Jennifer Darwin, a spokeswoman for the
company. She declined to disclose the terms of the transaction.  The building is selling for $230 million, or about $300 a
square foot, according to the Wall Street Journal, which
reported the agreement earlier today.  Steve Solomon, a spokesman for L&L Holding Co., a New York-
based developer and commercial property landlord, declined to
comment. Representatives for Boston-based Beacon Capital didnâ€™t
immediately respond to a telephone message left after regular
business hours.  Buildings in lower Manhattan sold for an average of $249 a
square foot in the 12 months through March, said  Ben Thypin ,
director of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics Inc.
Prices in the area have been driven down amid expectations that
the World Trade Center, which is under construction, will pull
tenants away from other buildings, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
