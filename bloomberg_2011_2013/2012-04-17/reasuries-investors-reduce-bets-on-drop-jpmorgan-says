JPMorgan Chase & Co. said investors
raised expectations for price gains in U.S. Treasuries by the
most on record in a weekly sentiment survey.  Long positions increased by 10 percentage points to 25
percent, the largest weekly increase in so-called outright longs
since the survey started in October 2010, JPMorgan said in a
report today. Neutral positions decreased by 15 percentage
points to 57 percent, the largest weekly decline since March 7,
2011.  Short positions increased by 6 percent to 19 percent. A
short position is a wager the price of a security will fall,
while a long position is a bet it will rise. JPMorgan doesnâ€™t
disclose the number of clients in the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
