China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ,
the country’s largest wind-power developer, will use  General
Electric Co. (GE)  turbines in Canada at its first project outside
China.  Longyuan Power will install 31 of GE’s 1.6-100 turbines and
18 of its 2.75-103 model at the 100-megawatt Dufferin wind farm
near Melanchthon, Ontario, the Fairfield, Connecticut-based
conglomerate said today in a statement.  The turbines will be delivered next year, and Dufferin is
expected to begin producing power in 2014. The project’s cost
and terms of the order weren’t disclosed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
