Indian bonds and the rupee climbed
after the nation’s central bank reduced borrowing costs for the
first time since 2009 to revive growth and  stocks  closed little
changed from the day’s high as the authority said there’s not
much scope for further cuts.  Benchmark bond yields fell to the lowest level in a month
and the rupee rebounded from near a three-month low after the
Reserve Bank of  India  cut the  repurchase  rate by 0.5 percentage
points to 8 percent, as predicted by three of 25 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, rose 1.2 percent
to 17,357.94 at the 3:30 p.m. close, near the intraday high of
17,381.92. India joins nations from  Brazil  to the  Philippines  in
cutting rates to support demand as political gridlock deters
investment and the European crisis dim global prospects.  Asia ’s
third-largest economy grew at the slowest pace in three years in
the fourth quarter amid RBI’s record run of rate increases.  “The cut was much larger than anticipated, and if banks
decrease rates, it could boost demand,” Vetri Subramaniam, head
of equities at Religare Asset Management Co., which has $2
billion in assets, said in an interview today. “Markets will
have to balance this positive surprise with the central bank’s
commentary that the room for future rate cuts is limited.”  Reserve Bank  Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said today consumer
price pressures may reduce the scope for further interest-rate
cuts. Government data yesterday showed  inflation  slowed less
than estimated in March to 6.89 percent, a pace that is still
the fastest among the biggest emerging economies.  Yields Narrow  The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 fell
12 basis points to 8.34 percent in Mumbai, the lowest since
March 14, according to the central bank’s trading system. The
rupee climbed 0.4 percent to 51.4850 per dollar in Mumbai. It
touched 51.725 yesterday, the weakest level since Jan. 16.  The Sensex has risen 12 percent this year as foreign funds
 bought  a net $8.9 billion of domestic shares, a record for the
period, amid optimism the central bank will take steps to ease
monetary policy. Gross domestic  product  may grow 7.3 percent in
the year through March 2013, compared with the baseline
projection of 7 percent for the previous 12 months, the central
bank estimated today.  Subbarao has eased monetary conditions by reducing the
amount of deposits lenders must set aside as  reserves  twice this
year to ease cash shortages in the banking system. He left the
 cash reserve ratio  unchanged today.  “By and large, the tone of the policy will continue to
remain accommodative for spurring growth,” said Dhawal Dalal,
Mumbai-based head of fixed income at DSP Blackrock Investment
Managers Pvt. “The RBI may also inject the right amount of
liquidity to increase  money supply .” The reserve ratio may be
cut by a further 100 basis points this fiscal year, he said.  Money Supply  The central bank projected money  supply  to grow 15 percent
in the 12 months through March 2013. The measure, comprising
currency in public circulation, bank deposits and money parked
in other saving plans, rose 13 percent in the year to March 23,
according to central bank data.  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee March 16 boosted India’s
debt sale plan by 12 percent to a record 5.7 trillion rupees in
his budget for the current fiscal year. The borrowing program
may keep yields from falling sharply as that may damp appetite
for existing notes, DSP’s Dalal said.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell eight basis
points to 7.86 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 13, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  VIX Slumps  State Bank of India , the biggest lender, rose 1.7 percent
to 2,304.3 rupees.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the largest developer, climbed 2.9
percent to 205.05 rupees.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest
engineering company, surged 2.4 percent to 1,332.8 rupees.  India VIX, which measures the cost of protection against
losses in the S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index, sank 8.6 percent to 20.31,
the most in a month. The Nifty added 1.2 percent to 5,289.70.
The  BSE 200 Index (BSE200)  rose 1.1 percent.  A total 672 million shares changed hands on the BSE and NSE
yesterday, 26 percent less than the daily average in the past 12
months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Offshore  investors  sold a net  5.52 billion rupees  ($107
million) of local stocks yesterday, paring their investment in
the equities this year to 438.9 billion rupees, according to the
nation’s market regulator.  To contact the reporters on this story:
