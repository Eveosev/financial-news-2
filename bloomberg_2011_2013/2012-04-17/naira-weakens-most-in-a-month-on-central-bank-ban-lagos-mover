Nigeria’s naira fell the most in
more than a month as demand increased from finished goods and
general merchandise importers following a ban imposed on them by
the central bank.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.2 percent to 157.625 naira per dollar as of 4.45 p.m. on the
 interbank market  in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Finished goods and general merchandise importers do not
qualify to access the official foreign exchange market, the
 Central Bank of Nigeria  said in a publication on April 10. The
bank is the dominant supplier of foreign exchange in the country
followed by crude exporters.  “Increased demand from finished goods importers and the
fact that there was just a single auction by the central bank
last week owing to the public holiday are pushing the naira to
depreciation,” Sewa Wusu, a currency analyst at Lagos-based
Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone today. “The ban can only
affect the market only when the demand from the importers
accumulates as finished products are a small percentage of
imports.”  Nigeria ’s foreign-exchange reserves rose 9.7 percent this
year to $36.1 billion as of April 13, according to data compiled
by the central bank.  Borrowing costs on domestic 2019 bonds rose 3 basis points
to 15.27 percent, according to April 16 prices on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the West African
nation’s $500 million of dollar bonds fell 10 basis points to
5.419 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated 0.3 percent to 1.8149 per dollar
in Accra, the weakest on record since at least June 1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
