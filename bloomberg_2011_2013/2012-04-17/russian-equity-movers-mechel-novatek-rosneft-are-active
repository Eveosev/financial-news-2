The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 0.6
percent to 1,468.74 by 5:42 p.m. in Moscow. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index fell by 0.4 percent to 1,581.28.  The following are among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO  Mechel (MTLR)  , tumbled the most in two weeks after
the Natural Resources Ministry said the company’s Yakutugol unit
committed breaches at three areas that are serious enough to
warrant pulling the licenses. The shares fell as much as 3.8
percent, the most on an intraday basis since April 4, and traded
2.9 percent lower at 270 rubles.  OAO Novatek (NVTK RX),  Russia ’s second-biggest gas
producer, rose for the first time in four days after the company
said it is considering joint ventures to develop Arctic gas
fields with bigger rival OAO Gazprom and boosted planned
production of liquefied natural gas. Novatek shares rose as much
as 1.3 percent before trading less than 0.1 percent higher at
374.40 rubles. OAO Gazprom (GAZP RX) retreated 3 percent to
169.21 rubles, heading for its lowest close since Dec. 19, after
President-Elect  Vladimir Putin  urged the government to raise
taxes for natural gas producers.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN RX), Russia’s largest oil company,
retreated 0.3 percent to 210.31 rubles, poised for the first
daily drop in three trading sessions, as the price of Urals
crude, the country’s export blend, fell 0.4 percent to $114.25 a
barrel, heading for its lowest close since Feb. 2. The shares
rose as much as 1.2 percent earlier after Exxon Mobil Corp. sold
stakes in North American oilfields to Rosneft as part of an
agreement to jointly explore off the coast of Russia announced
late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
