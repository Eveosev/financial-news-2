BP Plc purchased a cargo of diesel
for delivery to the U.K for a second day, bringing its tally for
this month to eight lots. The differential between heating oil
barges and gasoil futures narrowed as North Sea Group bought.  Jet fuel barge premiums fell for at least a second day. Eni
SpA said it will shut parts of its Gela refinery for a year
because of reduced demand for fuels.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp region traded from $1,124 to $1,153 a metric ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board and the Platts pricing window. That’s lower
than yesterday’s range from $1,138 to $1,173 a ton.  Gunvor Group Ltd., Morgan Stanley, Chevron Corp. and Hess
Corp. were the main sellers of the Eurobob grade to which
ethanol is added to make finished fuel.  The product’s crack, a measure of refining profitability,
fell 65 cents to $14.30 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based crude and refined-products
broker, as of 2:48 p.m. local time.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent widened to $4.72 a barrel from
$4.50 in the previous session, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  BP bought 30,000 tons of diesel for delivery to the north-
eastern England port of Immingham from Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
the survey of Platts showed. The trade was done at a $27-premium
to May gasoil on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . That
compares with yesterday’s trade to the same port at $12 more
than the May low-sulfur gasoil contract.  In the Mediterranean, Repsol YPF SA sold a shipment of as
much as 30,000 tons to PetroChina Co. for delivery to Lavera in
the south of  France . The deal changed hands at $28 more than May
gasoil, $1 a ton lower than yesterday’s deal.  Jet fuel barge traded at premiums of $66 and $66.50 a ton
to May gasoil, according to the survey. That’s less than
yesterday’s deal at $67.  Heating oil barges traded at parity and discounts of 50
cents and $1 to May gasoil as 14,000 tons changed hands, the
survey showed. North Sea Group was the largest buyer with Shell
the main seller.  On the lower sulfur barges, North Sea Group sold 10,000
tons to BP at premiums of $9 and $10 to gasoil futures.  May gasoil dropped $2 to $992 a ton as of 5:22 p.m. London
time on the ICE exchange. The June contract was at $989.75 a
ton, keeping the market in backwardation for a third day.  Backwardation describes a market where contracts closest to
expiry cost more than later-dated shipments. It can signal an
increase in immediate demand or fall in supply.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profitability, was
little changed at $14.51 a barrel as of 4:30 p.m. London time.
 Brent crude  fell 0.3 percent to at $118.32 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $680 to $682.50 a ton, the
survey of Platts showed. That compares with deals from $680.75
to $683 yesterday.  Refineries  Eni,  Italy ’s largest oil company, said today in an e-
mailed statement that the halt will include less-profitable
units, without being more specific. The shutdown will affect 500
workers, it said.  Neste Oil Oyj started maintenance today at its Naantali
facility that will last at least two months.  “The plan is to have the site back online at the beginning
of June,” Elina Herrala, the 50,000 barrel-a-day refinery’s
manager, said in an e-mailed statement. “We will also carry out
a number of environmental and safety-related investments.”  Egypt ’s largest refinery, a 146,300 barrel-a-day plant in
the port city of Suez, will resume operations within a week
after fires at its naphtha tanks, a company official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
