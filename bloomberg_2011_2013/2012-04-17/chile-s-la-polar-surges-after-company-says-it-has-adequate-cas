Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR) , the Chilean
department-store operator seeking to avert its second bankruptcy
in 13 years, rose for a fifth day after the company said it has
enough cash to fund operations this year.  La Polar rose 14 percent to 442.01 pesos at 1:21 p.m. in
Santiago, following a 15 percent jump yesterday. It has more
than doubled in the past month.  Chairman Cesar Barros touted the company’s cash levels as
well as its operations in  Colombia  in a letter to shareholders
posted on its website. The retailer also said it may have to
return about $21 million to 140,000 customers who were
overcharged for credit.  The company’s revenue from Colombian stores rose more than
fivefold in 2011 from a year earlier, according to a statement
sent April 5 to Chilean regulators.  La Polar is scheduled to host its annual shareholder
meeting on April 27. The company is seeking to sell as much as
$220 million in new shares, according to the letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
