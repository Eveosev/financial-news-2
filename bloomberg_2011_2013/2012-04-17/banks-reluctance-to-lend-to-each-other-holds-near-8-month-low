European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held near the lowest level in eight months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The  Euribor-OIS spread , the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was 40.5
basis points at 1:25 p.m. in London, compared with 41 yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The measure reached an eight-
month low of 40 basis points on April 10.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars fell. The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 50
basis points below Euribor from minus 54 basis points yesterday.
The cost reached an eight-month low of minus 49.5 on March 26.  The one-year basis swap was 56 basis points less than
Euribor from minus 57 yesterday. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the  European
Central Bank  on April 16, placing 745 billion euros ($977
billion) with the Frankfurt-based bank from 743 billion euros
the day before.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they pay for three-
month loans in euros, fell to 0.746 percent from 0.750 percent.
One-week Euribor was unchanged at 0.315 percent.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for three-
month dollar loans was unchanged at 0.466 percent.  Three-month  dollar Euribor , a gauge of dollar funding costs
started by the Brussels-based European Banking Federation on
April 2, was unchanged at 0.972 percent.  The three-month euro FRA-OIS spread, the difference between
floating-rate agreements and overnight indexed swaps, was 36
basis points from 37 basis points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
