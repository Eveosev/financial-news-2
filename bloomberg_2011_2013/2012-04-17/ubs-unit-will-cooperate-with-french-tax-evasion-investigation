UBS AG (UBSN) ’s French unit said it is
prepared to cooperate with French investigators looking into
 tax-evasion  allegations.  UBS, which hasn’t been contacted by investigators, “has
taken note of” French press reports about the probe and “will
of course fully collaborate with the authorities,” the Zurich-
based bank’s French unit said in an e-mailed statement today.  Paris prosecutors opened a formal investigation April 12,
after conducting a preliminary inquiry with the customs service
into a complaint by  France ’s Prudential Control Authority in
February 2011 over the bank’s practices in France. The probe,
which doesn’t name a target, is led by an investigating judge,
Guillaume Daieff, the Paris prosecutors office said today,
confirming a report in  Les Echos . French banking regulator ACP
began looking into questions about the bank’s internal controls
and transfers between French accounts and undeclared ones in
 Switzerland , according to the French business newspaper.  UBS avoided prosecution in the U.S. in 2009 by paying $780
million, admitting it helped thousands of Americans evade taxes
and turning over the names of 250 American clients to U.S.
authorities. UBS later revealed another 4,450 accounts held by
clients in the country.  Switzerland enacted bank secrecy laws in 1934 after a
French tax evasion investigation. In that case, Basler
Handelsbank bankers were arrested in Paris in 1932 for aiding
the firm’s French clients in tax evasion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
