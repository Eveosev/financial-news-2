Denison Mines Corp. (DML) , a Canadian
uranium producer, rose the most in three months after analysts
said an agreement to sell U.S. assets may make it a more
attractive acquisition target.  Denison  surged  17 percent to C$1.65 at the close in
Toronto, where the company is based. It was the biggest gain
since Jan. 16 for Denison, which has risen 30 percent this year.  The company agreed yesterday to sell its U.S. mining assets
to  Energy Fuels Inc. (EFR)  in an all-share transaction valued at
C$106.3 million ($107.5 million) based on yesterday’s prices.
Denison will still have assets in Canada, Zambia and Mongolia.  “The trimmed down Denison may be more attractive as an
acquisition target post the transaction,” Edward Sterck, an
analyst at BMO Capital Markets in London, said in a note today.  Senior uranium producers will be “very interested” in
Denison’s Canadian assets, including its 22.5 percent stake in
 Areva SA (AREVA) ’s McClean Lake mill in Saskatchewan, Adam Schatzker, a
Toronto-based analyst at  RBC Capital Markets , said in a note.  “Denison’s U.S. assets acted as a poison pill for
potential acquirers,” he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
