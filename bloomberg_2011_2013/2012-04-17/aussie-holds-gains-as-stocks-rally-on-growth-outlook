The Australian dollar remained
higher against most of its major peers as Asian stocks extended
a global rally after the  International Monetary Fund  raised its
economic growth outlook.  The  New Zealand dollar  rose for a second day versus the yen
as a drop in currency-market volatility supported demand for
higher-yielding assets. Gains in the so-called kiwi were limited
after Auckland-based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. said whole-
milk powder prices fell to the lowest since August 2009, and
before data forecast to show inflation stayed within the  Reserve
Bank  of New Zealand’s target of 1 percent to 3 percent.  “It’s a pretty fair bet we’d run with the positive
sentiment for now,” said  Sean Callow , a senior currency
strategist in Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp. “We’ve seen a
pretty big move on the likes of Aussie and kiwi. I think they
can test a little bit higher on the day.”  Australia ’s currency traded at $1.0398 at 4:14 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0390 yesterday. It gained 0.7 percent to 84.59
yen from yesterday, when it rallied 0.9 percent to 84.  New Zealand’s currency fetched 82.15 U.S. cents from 82.10.
The kiwi strengthened 0.7 percent to 66.83 yen from yesterday,
when it rose 0.6 percent to 66.38.  The MSCI Asia Pacific  Index (CRY)  of stocks rose 1.2 percent,
following a 1.6 percent rally in the MSCI World Index yesterday.
The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials climbed
0.4 percent yesterday.  IMF Forecast  The  implied volatility  of three-month options for Group of
Seven currencies was 9.77 percent, little changed from yesterday
when it touched 9.66, the lowest since August 2008, according to
the JPMorgan G7  Volatility Index . The average over the past
decade is 10.6 percent. A drop makes investments in currencies
with higher rates more attractive because it shows the risk is
lower that market moves will erase profits on such trades.  The IMF’s World Economic Outlook forecast the global
economy will expand 3.5 percent this year and 4.1 percent in
2013, an increase from its January projections of 3.3 percent
growth in 2012 and 4 percent next year.  Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said the IMF report
confirms the nation’s economic fundamentals are strong. IMF
forecasts for Australian growth of 3 percent in 2012 and 3.5
percent in 2013 are consistent with the government’s plan to
return to surplus in 2012-2013, Swan said in a statement.  An Australian index of leading economic indicators rose 0.2
percent in February from a month earlier to 284.2,  Westpac
Banking Corp. (WBC)  and the Melbourne Institute said in Sydney today.  Milk Prices  Australia’s government bonds  declined , pushing up the yield
on the 10-year security seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 3.87 percent. The  rate  on the two-year government note
also rose seven basis points to 3.27 percent.  Fonterra, the world’s largest dairy exporter, said milk
powder for June delivery fell 13.6 percent from the April 3
sale, the largest decline since August 2010, according to a
trade-weighted index. The near-term contract declined for the
ninth consecutive auction to $2,766 a metric ton, the company
said on its GlobalDairyTrade website.  Statistics New Zealand data tomorrow may show that the
nation’s consumer price index increased 0.5 percent in the first
quarter from the previous three-month period, according to
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Prices
probably rose 1.6 percent from a year earlier, the slowest
annual pace since September 2010.  The decline in milk prices “is not very helpful for the
kiwi,” said Westpac’s Callow. “If you get a very low CPI
tomorrow that would be a bit of a double whammy.”  New Zealand ’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, added 2 1/2 basis points to 2.95
percent. It touched 2.90 percent on April 16, the lowest since
Feb. 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
