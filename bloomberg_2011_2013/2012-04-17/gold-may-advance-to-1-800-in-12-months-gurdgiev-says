Gold probably will advance to
$1,800 an ounce in 12 months on a negative outlook for the
European economy and  China ’s real estate sector, according to
Constantin Gurdgiev, an economist at Trinity College in Dublin.  “I can see a rather bullish scenario for gold in the
short-to-medium term,” said Gurdgiev, who is also a non-
executive member of the investment committee at  GoldCore Ltd. , a
Dublin-based brokerage that sells and stores everything from
quarter-ounce British Sovereigns to 400-ounce bars.  Bullion was little changed at $1,651 an ounce by 9:22 a.m.
in  London , for a 5.6 percent gain this year. The price may be
driven higher by Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and a slowdown
in China’s real-estate sector, Gurdgiev said in an interview in
Moscow on April 13, while stressing that other scenarios are
possible.  The global economy by 2014 may have started a cycle of
growth accompanied by inflation, increasing demand for gold as a
means of protecting wealth, pushing the price to more than
$2,200 an ounce, Gurdgiev said.  “Heightened inflation prospects” will be driven by
expectations of stronger demand for commodities and a large-
scale liquidity withdrawal in  Europe  and  Japan , according to
Gurdgiev.  To contact the reporter on this story:
