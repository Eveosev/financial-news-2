European proposals to model
financial rules for pensions on those established for insurers
could stymie investment and make the plans more expensive,
according to Mark Hoban, the U.K.’s financial secretary.  Applying  capital requirements  originally directed by the
European Union at insurers to pension funds, “carries a strong
risk of locking capital in pension schemes, reducing investment
in growth and significantly reducing the affordability of
pensions,” Hoban said in a letter to the British Bankers’
Association that was obtained by Bloomberg News.  The so-called Solvency II rules are scheduled for
introduction in 2013 and require insurers to retain more high-
quality assets.  “As the commission have not yet finalized their proposals,
the debate as to how to regulate pensions across Europe remains
open,” Hoban said in the letter, dated today and addressed to
 Angela Knight , chief executive of the BBA.  Prudential Plc (PRU) ’s Chief Executive Officer  Tidjane Thiam  said
last month that tougher capital rules for insurers in Europe
mean they won’t be able to compete in the U.S., which may force
the U.K.’s biggest insurer to leave the country.  Regulators and the European Union have agreed to postpone
full application of the rules until 2014, following discussions
with the industry.  “I have never said or suggested that pension funds should
be subject to exactly the same rules as Solvency II,”  Michel Barnier , the EU commissioner for financial services, said in a
statement on his website in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
