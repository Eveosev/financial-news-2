China ’s benchmark money-market
rates fell, snapping a four-day gain, after savings at banks
rose.  Fresh yuan deposits at lenders increased 10 percent in
March from a year earlier to 2.95 trillion yuan ($468 billion),
according to central bank data on April 12. The decline in the
rate may be limited as companies’ tax payments due this month
and next boost demand for funds, said  Ju Wang , a Barclays
Capital strategist.  “Liquidity improved after bank deposits increased in
March,” Singapore-based Ju said.  Still, corporate tax payments
“will reduce broad liquidity,” she said.  The  seven-day repo rate , a gauge of funding availability in
the financial system, dropped four basis points to 3.76 percent
in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center.  The one-year swap rate, the fixed cost needed to receive
the seven-day repurchase rate, increased one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.23 percent.  The central bank sold 33 billion yuan of 28-day  repurchase
agreements  at a yield of 2.8 percent today, according to a
statement on its website. The People’s Bank of China is likely
to continue making small withdrawals via open-market operations,
Ju said.  The yield on the 3.51 percent government bonds due February
2022 was little changed at 3.53 percent today, according to the
National Interbank Funding Center.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
