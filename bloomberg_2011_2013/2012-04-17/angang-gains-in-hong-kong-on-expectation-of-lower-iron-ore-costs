Angang Steel Co. (347) , the biggest Hong
Kong-traded steelmaker, gained after saying it will buy  iron ore 
from its parent at rates closer to spot market prices amid
expectations that raw material costs may fall.  Angang climbed as much as 2.1 percent to HK$5.42 in Hong
Kong and traded at HK$5.40 at 11:29 a.m. local time. The
benchmark  Hang Seng (2828)  Index fell 0.7 percent.  The steelmaker, based in Anshan in Liaoning province, will
buy ore from parent Anshan Iron & Steel Group in 2012 and 2013
at a 5 percent discount to the average spot price two months
earlier, the company said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock
exchange today. The previous rate was based on average prices of
the prior six months.  “Under the new agreement, Angang’s earnings should at
least turn around in the first quarter,”  Helen Lau , a Hong
Kong-based analyst with UOB-Kay Hian Ltd., said in an e-mailed
note today. Angang will adjust its first-quarter results once
shareholders approve the agreement at a meeting scheduled on
June 28, she said.  Iron ore prices remain “distorted” and have room to fall
10 percent to 20 percent, Chen Ming, Angang Steel’s vice
chairman, said in Hong Kong March 29.  Spot  prices  of 62 percent-iron ore arriving at  China ’s
Tianjin port gained 8 percent this year, according to the Steel
Index. It fell 0.1 percent yesterday to $149.30 a metric ton.  Angang expects a first-quarter loss of about 1.89 billion
yuan ($299 million), compared with a profit of 71 million yuan a
year earlier due to a steep decline in steel prices, the company
said in an April 13  Hong Kong  stock exchange statement, citing
unaudited figures under Chinese accounting standards.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
