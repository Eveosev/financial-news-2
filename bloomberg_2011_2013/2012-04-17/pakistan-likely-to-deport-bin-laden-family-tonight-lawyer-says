Pakistan may deport the family of
slain al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to  Saudi Arabia  tonight
after his three widows and two older daughters complete short
jail sentences for illegally entering the country.  Police found the women in bin Laden’s fortress-like
compound at Abbottabad on May 2, hours after U.S. commandos
attacked in helicopters, killing bin Laden and then flying his
body out of the country. An unconfirmed number of the women’s
younger children also were detained  A Pakistani court this month said two Saudi women, Siham
Sharif and Kharia Hussain Sabir, were among the widows,
according to court documents cited by the  Express-Tribune  and
other Pakistani newspapers. Bin Laden’s third wife in Pakistan
was Amal Ahmad Abdul Fateh, a citizen of Yemen.  The court ordered the women deported after they served 45-
day jail terms, which are to end at midnight today. Those
sentences officially started on March 3 when the women were
formally arrested, Mohammad Aamir, their lawyer, said by phone
from Islamabad today.  Bin Laden’s family has been held in a suburban-style two-
story villa in Islamabad,  Pakistan ’s capital, Interior Minister
Rehman Malik told reporters last month. He didn’t immediately
answer calls to his office today seeking comment.  Pakistan in February demolished most of the hideout where
bin Laden had lived since 2005. A four-member commission named
by Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  is investigating why the
army failed to detect bin Laden’s presence or prevent the U.S.
attack.  To contact the reporter on this story:
