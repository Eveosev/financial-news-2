Evonik Industries AG, the German
chemical maker that’s planning a share sale in the first half,
will end a joint venture in  China  after it found “gross
irregularities,” spokeswoman Barbara Mueller said.  The German company’s compliance office and internal
auditors have been investigating problems at the Evonik Sanzheng
Fine Chemicals venture for a year and the responsible employees
at the venture have been fired, Mueller said in response to e-
mailed questions, without elaborating.  The joint venture partner had asked for a reimbursement of
850,000 euros ($1.11 million), which Evonik refused to pay and
the German company doesn’t know what the money was for, Mueller
said. Handelsblatt reported earlier today that costs to end the
joint venture would be about 25 million euros, citing an
internal report. Mueller declined to comment on costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
