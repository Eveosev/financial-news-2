Canada ’s finances are more sound
than the U.S. and the country has room to slow the pace of
fiscal tightening if the global economy worsens, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  The Washington-based lender, in its World Economic Outlook
 report , also called Canada’s housing market an area of
“potential vulnerability.”  The IMF raised its growth estimate for Canada’s economy to
2.1 percent for this year and 2.2 percent in 2013. In January,
the IMF projected 2012 growth of 1.7 percent and 2 percent for
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
