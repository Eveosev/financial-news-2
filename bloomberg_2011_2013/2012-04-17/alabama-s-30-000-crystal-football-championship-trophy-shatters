The  University of Alabama  has one
crystal trophy to show for its two national championships in
football in the past three years after the latest award was
accidentally shattered.  The $30,000 trophy was knocked off its podium after the
team’s spring scrimmage in Tuscaloosa three days ago when a
player’s father bumped the table it was on after getting his
foot caught in a tablecloth, athletic department spokesman Jeff
Purinton said in an e-mail. The school is looking into having it
replaced.  Alabama  received the handmade Waterford crystal trophy
after beating Louisiana State University 21-0 in the Bowl
Championship Series title game on Jan. 9. The BCS trophy, which
weighs about eight pounds, is presented each year by the
American Football Coaches Association.  “We’ll work with them and try to put another one in place
as soon as possible,” AFCA spokesman Mel Pulliam said in a
telephone interview. “Certainly we’ll try to fast-track it.”  The University of Florida also had its crystal BCS trophy
from 2008 broken when it was dropped by a recruit. That’s the
only other case of a trophy breaking that Pulliam says he
remembers.  The coaches’ association travels with a second trophy to
hundreds of appearances each year, from corporate hospitality
areas on game days to local television stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
