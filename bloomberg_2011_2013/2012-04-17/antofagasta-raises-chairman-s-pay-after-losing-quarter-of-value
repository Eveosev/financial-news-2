Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) , whose Chief
Executive Officer  Marcelo Awad  unexpectedly resigned last month,
increased payments to Chairman Jean-Paul Luksic about 6 percent
last year after losing a quarter of its value in London trading.  Luksic, who took over as interim CEO after Awad quit, got
$3.5 million including benefits and bonuses, compared with $3.3
million a year earlier, the company said in its annual report.  Antofagasta, based in London, posted an 18 percent jump in
net income to $1.24 billion in 2011, missing the $1.26 billion
average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Its
dividend fell to 44 cents a share, including a 24-cent special
payment, from $1.16 with a $1 one-time component a year earlier.
Antofagasta fell 25 percent to 1,215 pence in  London  last year.  The company, which last year increased copper output by 23
percent to 640,500 metric tons, plans to produce 700,000 tons in
2012. Awad left March 7 after delays at the Esperanza project in
 Chile  forced Antofagasta to cut an output forecast for last year
to 620,000 to 640,000 tons, from 715,000 tons previously. The
company plans to produce 280,000 ounces of gold this year.  “The increase in the copper and gold production compared
with 2011 reflects the impact of Esperanza operating in a
steady-state of production for a full year, following the
completion of the main ramp-up process during 2011,” Luksic
said in the report. Antofagasta expects copper prices to remain
high on a lack of concentrate supply, according to the report.  “Macro-economic uncertainty means that prices in the short
term are likely to remain volatile,” Luksic said. “Long-term
market fundamentals remain positive for copper, with inventories
remaining at low levels by historic standards.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
