Cobalt International Energy Inc. (CIE) ,
the offshore oil explorer backed by  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
rose after Morgan Stanley said it doesn’t believe the company
will lose stakes in Angolan properties.  Cobalt  climbed  4.1 percent to $27.44 at the close in  New
York , the biggest gain since April 3. Cobalt fell 7.2 percent
yesterday.  Two Angolan officials confirmed concealed stakes in Nazaki
Oil & Gas SA, a partner in Houston-based Cobalt’s offshore
Angolan operations, which may raise questions about compliance
with U.S. anti-bribery law, the Financial Times reported this
week.  “The market is overreacting to worries of alleged” Cobalt
violations, analysts including Evan Calio said in a Morgan
Stanley morning equity summary. Cobalt has “no risk of losing”
its interests in pre-salt Angola blocks under U.S. law,
according to the note.  Cobalt said in a statement yesterday that it is confident
it hasn’t broken any U.S. or Angolan laws. The company started
an investigation into its Angolan business relationships in 2007
and will maintain “rigorous due diligence” in its worldwide
operations, according to the statement.  Goldman Sachs held 16.05 percent of Cobalt as of Feb. 29,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
