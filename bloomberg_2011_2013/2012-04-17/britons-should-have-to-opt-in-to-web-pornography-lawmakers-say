Prime Minister  David Cameron  said
he will examine whether British Internet service providers
should require customers to opt into accessing pornographic
websites and impose a network-level ban on everyone else to
protect children.  The cross-party Independent Parliamentary Inquiry Into
Online Child Protection concluded in a report published in
 London  today that the proliferation of devices that can access
the Internet means current efforts to stop children from seeing
unsuitable material on individual computers are obsolete.  Instead, it said Internet service providers should ban
adult sites unless customers verify their ages and say they want
access, the model currently used by many mobile phone providers.  “As a parent, and as a politician, I’m keen to help
protect people from this material,” Cameron told lawmakers in
the House of Commons during his weekly questions session today.  As a first step, the panel urged the government to require
ISPs to introduce in the next 12 months a “one click” option
to allow parents to turn off pornography on their home networks.
It also said public wireless networks should have a similar
filter.  “Many children are easily accessing Internet pornography
as well as other websites showing extreme violence or promoting
self-harm and anorexia,” Claire Perry, the Conservative
lawmaker who headed the committee, said in an e-mailed
statement. “It’s time that Britain’s  Internet service
providers , who make more than 3 billion pounds a year from
selling Internet access services, took on more of the
responsibility to keep children safe, and the government needs
to send a strong message that this is what we all expect.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
