Wind-power capacity will more than
double by 2016 as growing installations in newer markets such as
 India  and Brazil counter weakness in the U.S., where additions
are set to decline next year, according to an industry lobby.  World capacity will reach 493 gigawatts in 2016, from 238
gigawatts in 2011, the Global Wind Energy Council said in an e-
mailed report today. Installations will jump 8 percent a year on
average to 59 gigawatts during 2016, from 41 gigawatts in 2011.  Even with the growth, the biggest wind-turbine makers such
as Vestas Wind Systems A/S and Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA face
shrinking margins because of excess world production and Chinese
competition. Prices of turbines sold in the second half of 2011
fell 4 percent to $910,000 a megawatt, the lowest since at least
2008, when records began, Bloomberg New Energy Finance says.  The next five years “will be especially tough for
manufacturers, with chronic oversupply adding to existing
downward pressure from general economic conditions to cut
margins dramatically,” according to the lobby’s report.  Growth in installations will stall next year because of the
possible loss of a tax credit in the U.S., the second-biggest
market after  China , it said. New capacity will rise more than 13
percent to 46 gigawatts this year, drop to 45.8 gigawatts in
2013 and resume gains to 49.4 gigawatts in 2014, 55.2 gigawatts
in 2015, and 59.2 gigawatts in 2016, according to the group.  Single Greatest Factor  “The single greatest factor affecting the global market in
2012 will be the debate on the future of the U.S. Production Tax
Credit,”  Steve Sawyer , the secretary-general of the industry
lobby, said in the report. “Wrapped up in the politics of a
presidential election year, anything could still happen.”  The credit grants an incentive worth 2.2 cents a kilowatt-
hour and expires at the end of the year. When it was allowed to
lapse at the end of 2003, U.S. wind installations declined to
397 megawatts in 2004 from 1,670 megawatts the previous year.  “Stable policy is needed for the wind industry to begin to
live up to its potential, attracting massive new investment and
creating thousands of new jobs,” according to the report.  Vestas may fire 1,600 workers in the U.S. if the credit
expires, Chief Executive Officer  Ditlev Engel  said in January.  Siemens AG can “adjust” U.S. operations to adapt to a
policy change, Felix Ferlemann, CEO of the company’s wind power
division, said yesterday in Copenhagen, declining to elaborate.  Indian Growth  The council, which didn’t forecast annual installations by
nation in its report, said  Asia  will remain the largest market
for  wind turbines , led by China. Most growth will come from
India, which will have an annual market of 5 gigawatts by 2015.  In  Europe , falling Spanish installations are countered by
gains in Romania, Poland, Turkey and  Sweden , it said.  Spain  in
January announced a moratorium on subsidies for new wind farms.  In  Latin America ,  Brazil  has become a “major international
market” and will make up three-quarters of the 8.6 gigawatts of
installations seen in the region over the five years, it added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
