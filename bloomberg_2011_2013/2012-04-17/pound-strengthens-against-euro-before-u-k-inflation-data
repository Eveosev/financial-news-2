Gilts fell for the first time in
three days as signs the European sovereign debt crisis is easing
damped demand for the relative safety of U.K. government debt.  Gilts declined along with German bunds after  Spain  raised
more than its maximum target at a bill sale and a German report
showed investor confidence unexpectedly increased in April. U.K.
bonds also dropped and the pound strengthened against most of
its 16 major peers after a report showed inflation accelerated,
fueling speculation the  Bank of England  will refrain from
further asset purchases, or quantitative easing.  “Gilts sold off initially because of bunds selling off,”
said Anthony O’Brien, a fixed-income strategist at Morgan
Stanley in London. The inflation data “casts a bit of doubt on
whether they’re going to go for QE in May.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt climbed seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.10 percent at 4:33 p.m.  London 
time after dropping five basis points over the past two days.
The 4 percent bond due March 2022 fell 0.675, or 5.75 pounds per
1,000-pound ($1,596) face amount, to 116.885.  Spain’s 10-year bond yields declined 18 basis points to
5.89 percent after the nation sold 3.18 billion euros ($4.18
billion) of bills, surpassing the Treasury’s maximum target of 3
billion euros. The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in
Mannheim said its index of German investor and analyst
expectations increased to a two-year high of 23.4 in April.  U.K. Inflation  U.K. consumer prices climbed 3.5 percent from a year
earlier, after rising 3.4 percent in February, the  Office for
National Statistics  said in London. The reading was higher than
the 3.4 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, and above the central bank’s target of 2 percent.  The pound appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.5938, and climbed
0.6 percent to 128.66 yen. Sterling gained 0.3 percent to 82.44
pence per euro after reaching 82.10 pence yesterday, the
strongest level since September 2010.  “Inflation has been very sticky,”  David Bloom , global
head of currency strategy at HSBC Holdings Plc in London, said
before the data was released. “If you get the knee-jerk spike
up in sterling because the inflation numbers are higher, I’d
sell into it.” He spoke in an interview on Bloomberg
Television’s “On The Move” with  Mark Barton .  Sterling has gained 0.6 percent in the past month, the
second-best performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes after the yen,
which gained 3.6 percent. The euro dropped 0.3 percent.  Gilts Underperform  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 0.6 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. That’s the
fourth worst performance among 26 sovereign markets tracked by
the indexes.  The 10-year gilt yield will meet resistance should it
decline to its 50-day moving average 1.86 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Resistance refers to an area on
yield charts where sell orders may be grouped.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to auction 1.35
billion pounds of inflation-linked bonds due in March 2029 on
April 19. The office will sell 28-, 91- and 182-day bills on the
following day.  -- With assistance from TJ Marta in  New York . Editors: Nicholas Reynolds,  Paul Dobson   To contact the reporter on this story:
