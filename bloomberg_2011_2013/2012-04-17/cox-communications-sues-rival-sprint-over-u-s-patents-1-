Cox Communications Inc. sued a
 Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  unit in Delaware federal court, seeking a
ruling that it doesn’t infringe 12 Sprint telecommunications
patents and that the patents aren’t valid.  Cox, based in Atlanta, also contends Sprint Communications
Co. is infringing two of its patents for data management,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in Wilmington.  “There is a substantial controversy between the parties of
sufficient immediacy and reality,” and “the Cox entities do
not infringe any valid and enforceable claim of the Sprint
patents,” Cox said in court papers.  The Delaware lawsuit stems from a related complaint filed
by  Overland Park , Kansas-based Sprint in December in  Kansas
City , alleging Cox infringes the 12 patents.  “We aren’t commenting on this case,” Stephanie Vinge-
Walsh, a Sprint spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement.  Cox provides video, high-speed Internet and telephone
services. Sprint provides wireless, wireline and Internet
access, among other services.  The case is Cox Communications v. Sprint Communications,
12cv487 U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
