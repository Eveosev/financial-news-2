The U.S. Northeast is expected to
cool down by next week after setting a record for heat during
yesterday’s  Boston  Marathon, while the West gets warmer.  Temperatures in the Northeast may be 2 to 6 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.1 to 3.3 Celsius) below normal from April 23 to
April 27, said  David Salmon , owner of Weather Derivatives in
Belton, Missouri. Temperatures in the West may reach 10 to 14
degrees above normal, Salmon said in his 6- to 10-day forecast.  “An already warm forecast in the West turned even warmer
today,” according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
Maryland. “Drought conditions across much of the West help to
support the stronger spikes of warmth as well.”  The high in Boston for race day was 87, breaking the record
for the date of 84 set in 2003, according to the  National
Weather Service .  New York  City’s high was 88, below the 2002
mark of 92.  Commodities traders watch temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use
gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Demand for gas from electricity generators peaks in the
summer months to meet air conditioning needs. Power plants
consumed about 31 percent of U.S. gas supplies in 2011,
department data show.  Heat is expected to remain in the West until next month,
according to an 11- to 15-day forecast, covering April 27 to May
1, from Commodity Weather Group LLC President  Matt Rogers .  Temperatures across the region may be 2 degrees above
normal, while in from Montana to western Nebraska they may be 8
degrees higher, he said from Bethesda, Maryland.  The Midwest, South and East may be more seasonal during the
period, Rogers said.  The normal average temperature for April 19 in New York is
about 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 Celsius), according to MDA. It’s
50 in Boston, 51 in  Chicago , 59 in  St. Louis , 63 in Atlanta, 64
in Dallas, 70 in Houston, 51 in Seattle and 62 in Burbank,
 California .  To contact the reporter on this story:
