As the cost of attending U.S.
colleges and universities surges, student-loan debt is turning
into “a significant drag on the housing market,” according to
 Pierre Lapointe , a Brockhouse & Cooper Inc. strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows tuition expense has risen about
three times as fast as wages since 2001 before accounting for
inflation, according to data from the Labor Department. The
chart uses average weekly earnings to gauge workers’ pay.  Tuition climbed 57 percent on an inflation-adjusted basis
during the period, Lapointe and two colleagues wrote yesterday
in a report. At the same time, the average wage for American
workers between the ages of 25 and 34 dropped 7 percent.  Borrowing to pay for college exceeded $1 trillion within
the past few months, according to Rohit Chopra, the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau’s student-loan ombudsman. Chopra
made that estimate in March.  “The explosion in student debt is a development that calls
for a lower homeownership rate,” Lapointe, based in  Montreal ,
wrote with analyst Alex Bellefleur and economist Frances Donald.  Many former students won’t be able to obtain mortgages at
affordable rates because of their debt burdens, the report said.
Lapointe estimated that interest payments on student debt amount
to $1,165 a year, based on an average balance of $23,300 in last
year’s third quarter and a 5 percent interest rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
