Centum Investment Co. (CENTUM) ,  Kenya ’s
largest investment company, gained for a fourth day, closing at
its highest in almost seven weeks, after it was recommended buy
in new coverage at Old Mutual Securities.  The shares climbed as much as 3.9 percent to 14.80
shillings and ended trading 2.8 percent higher at 14.65
shillings by 3 p.m. in Nairobi. This is the highest level since
March 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The price estimate on the stock is 21.67 shillings, the
Nairobi-based brokerage said in an e-mailed statement today,
adding that at least three of the company’s holdings expect to
list in the next two years.  “This will unlock at least 30 percent of their value as
they become liquid,” Old Mutual said in the statement. “The
company owns stakes in a portfolio of mature, stable and cash
generating companies with large market shares.” Centum expects
to add two companies to its portfolio “soon,” Old Mutual said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
