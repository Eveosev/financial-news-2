Cevik Bir, the retired Turkish
general who called the military’s ouster of the government in
1997 a “postmodern coup,” said the files presented as evidence
against former officers are fake and denied the prosecution’s
charges, Hurriyet  reported .  Catalogs of people that the armed forces were allegedly
targeting, as well as files on a CD and two handwritten notes
presented to Bir weren’t prepared by the military, don’t match
protocol requirements and are amateur fakes, the former deputy
chief of the General Staff in Ankara said during his deposition,
according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Bir denied charges that the military plotted to overthrow
an Islamist-led coalition, saying he only carried out orders
from the government, the National Security Council and the prime
minister, Hurriyet reported. He asked to be released from prison
pending a potential trial, the newspaper said.  Turkey  arrested nine of the 31 former military officers it
detained last week in connection with a Feb. 28, 1997, National
Security Council meeting that led to the toppling of the
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
