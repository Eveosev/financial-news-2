The ruble retreated for a third day
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro  basket  as foreign
direct investment into  China  slumped, hurting demand for riskier
assets. Urals crude declined.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 33.7535
against the basket as of 5:05 p.m. in Moscow, heading for the
weakest close since April 11. The ruble was little changed at
29.5751 per dollar and lost 0.5 percent to 38.8625 per euro.  Foreign direct investment in China retreated 6.1 percent in
March from a year earlier, a fifth monthly fall, according to
data from the Ministry of Commerce today. Data showed last week
 China’s economy  expanded the least in almost three years in the
first quarter. Urals crude,  Russia ’s main oil blend, slipped 0.4
percent to $114.25 per barrel.  Falling oil and equities are helping drive the ruble’s
losses, according to Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign
exchange at Otkritie Bank in Moscow. “A correction is more
possible than some players think, especially as we see new
headlines from  Europe  and China which are negative,” he said in
an e-mail.  The Micex Index of Russian stocks lost 0.5 percent to
1,470.90. Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 29.9628 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 29.922 per dollar
yesterday.  Bonds Rise  Russia’s $2 billion of Eurobonds due April 2015 rose for a
second day, pushing the yield down eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.173 percent. Dollar-denominated notes due
the same year from OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender,
yielded 17 basis points less than yesterday at 3.665 percent,
while the yield on 2015 Eurobonds from state gas monopoly OAO
Gazprom declined seven basis points to 3.471 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps fell three basis points to
200 basis points, down from last year’s peak of 338 on Oct. 4,
according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
