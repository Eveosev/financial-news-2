The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  may
have hit its 2012 peak and started a drop of as much as 12
percent,  Piper Jaffray Cos. (PJC)  said, citing trend lines and a
decline in stocks setting new highs.  The S&P 500 has lost 3.5 percent since reaching an almost
four-year high on April 2, sinking below its average during the
past 50 days and breaking an uptrend line that extends from lows
in October and December. Indicators that the Minneapolis-based
firm uses to track the number of groups making new highs and
above a 200-day moving average sent sell signals for the first
time in a year.  Craig W. Johnson, a technical market strategist with Piper
Jaffray, said he expects the  S&P 500  to approach 1,250 to 1,275,
near its 200-day average. That would erase  half  of the index’s
320-point gain from its October low through early April. The
index reached its 2012 high of 1,419.04 on April 2 and closed at
1,369.57 yesterday.  “The overall internals and breadth are deteriorating,”
Johnson said in a telephone interview yesterday. “The highs for
the year have been made in.” He expects the S&P 500 to end the
year at 1,350.  Equity gains stalled this month after the S&P 500 jumped 12
percent in the biggest first-quarter rally since 1998. The
benchmark index had its first back-to-back weekly decline since
November last week as U.S. jobs data missed economists’
forecasts and concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing
growth in  China  intensified.  Industry Groups  Piper Jaffray divides stocks into 500 industry groups and
tracks the number of those making 26-week highs and how many of
the groups are above or below their rising or falling  200-day
moving average . A sell signal is triggered on the new-highs
indicator when its 10-week average drops 15 percent. The measure
of groups above their 40-week average is considered bearish when
the current weekly reading falls below its 10-week average for
two straight weeks and contracts at least 2.5 percent.  The new-highs indictor flagged sell in March 2011, followed
by a bearish signal in the 40-week average measure the next
month, according to Johnson. The S&P 500 reached the year’s high
on April 29 before slumping 19 percent through Oct. 3, the
biggest retreat since the  bull market  began in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
