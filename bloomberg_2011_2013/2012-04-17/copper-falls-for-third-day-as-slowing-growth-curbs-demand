Copper futures rose for the second
straight day as signs of progress on  Europe ’s debt crisis, while
an International Monetary Fund projection for faster global
economic growth buoyed the outlook for metal demand.  Spain sold more debt than planned, while German investor
confidence unexpectedly rose to a two-year high. The IMF raised
its forecast for global growth in 2012 to 3.5 percent from 3.3
percent and lifted its estimate for U.S. expansion. The reports
helped allay concerns sparked by data showing lower foreign
direct investment in  China  and a surprise drop U.S. housing
starts.  “The big fear is with the euro zone, and the news today
appeases some of the investor concerns about a catastrophic
scenario,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a market strategist at Archer
Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “Investors were able to shrug off some of the
earlier data out of China and the U.S.”  Copper futures for July delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$3.6495 a pound at noon on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
price fell as much as 1.2 percent. Before today, the metal
dropped 4.9 percent this month after gaining 11 percent in the
first quarter.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months rose 1 percent to $8,061.75 a metric ton ($3.66 a pound).  Aluminum, nickel and tin gained in London. Lead and zinc
dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
