Arsenal’s England midfielder  Jack Wilshere  will miss the rest of the season and won’t be fit for
the European Championship, Gunners manager  Arsene Wenger  said.  Wilshere, 20, hasn’t played this season because of an ankle
injury, though had targeted a return late in the campaign. That
prospect ended following a discussion between Wenger and the
player this week.  “Jack Wilshere will not play again this season and will
not go to the European Championships, that is for sure,” Wenger
said in comments on Arsenal’s website after last night’s 2-1
loss to Wigan. “His ankle is fine and he makes progress, but it
is slow progress. We had a chat about that this week. His
progress is not quick enough to go to the Euros.”  Wilshere, who last played for Arsenal in a July 31
exhibition match against the New York Red Bulls, had surgery to
repair a stress fracture of his right ankle in September. The
injury followed a breakthrough season in which he made 49
appearances for the Gunners and five for  England .  The European Championship in Poland and Ukraine starts June
8, with England’s first game of the tournament scheduled three
days later against  France .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
