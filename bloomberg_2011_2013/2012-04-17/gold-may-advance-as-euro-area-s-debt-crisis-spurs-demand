Gold futures advanced from a one-
week low as the dollar declined, increasing demand for the metal
as an alternative investment.  The greenback fell for the second straight day against a
basket of currencies as European debt concerns eased and the
 International Monetary Fund  increased its forecasts for economic
growth. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
rose as much as 0.9 percent.  “The dollar’s weakness is supporting all commodities,
including gold,” Sterling Smith, a market analyst at  Country
Hedging  in  St. Paul , Minnesota, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for June delivery rose 0.1 percent to settle
at $1,651.10 an ounce at 2:11 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price dropped to $1,635.20, the lowest since April
10. The precious metal has advanced 5.4 percent this year.  Silver futures for May delivery jumped 1 percent to $31.674
an ounce on the Comex. Prices have climbed 13 percent this year.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery climbed 0.6 percent to $1,584.70 an ounce.
Palladium futures for June delivery increased 1.7 percent to
$661.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
