Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330)  appointed
Thomas Tang as chief financial officer as the Hong Kong-listed
apparel company seeks to recover from an earnings slump that cut
its share price 73 percent last year.  Tang, 56 and previously CFO at  Sino Land Co. (83) ,  Sino Hotels
Holdings Ltd. (1221)  and  Tsim Sha Tsui Properties Ltd. (247) , will start at
the retailer from May 2, the company said in a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. Chew Fook Aun, his
predecessor, announced his departure from Esprit in December,
saying he was unable to spend enough time in Europe. Chew will
step down on May 1, Esprit said.  Esprit, which said in September that its brand had “lost
its soul”, reported a 74 percent drop in first-half profit in
February. The biggest clothing retailer listed in  Hong Kong  is
attempting to offset declining sales in Europe by adding 40 to
50 stores in China, Chief Executive Officer Ronald Van der Vis
said in an interview in Hong Kong in February.  “It’s a positive sign just by appointing somebody because
Esprit needs to fill the gap that Chew Fook Aun left,” said
Mohan Singh, an analyst at Citic Securities International.
“Tang also has good background working for a real estate
company and it should help Esprit in revamping its store
portfolio.”  Esprit shares climbed as much as 2.3 percent to HK$16.30
before trading at HK$16.20 at 9:56 a.m. local time. The stock is
now up 62 percent this year compared with a 13 percent gain for
the benchmark  Hang Seng Index . Chew’s resignation sent Esprit’s
stock plunging 11 percent on Dec. 6.  Financial Advisory Services  Prior to joining Sino in 2003, Tang was a managing director
of an investment and financial advisory services firm that’s a
member of an international group, overseeing operations in the
Asia-Pacific region, according to yesterday’s statement. He
started his career as an accountant at Peat Marwick, now KPMG,
in London and Hong Kong, it said.  Chew was appointed CFO in February 2009. He previously held
the same position at Link Management Ltd., manager of the Link
Real Estate Investment Trust. He was  Kerry Properties Ltd. (683) ’s CFO
from 1996 to 2004.  To contact the reporters on this story:
