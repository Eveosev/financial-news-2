Zimbabwe ’s decision to increase
fees for mining licenses and applications by as much as 5,000
percent may have been unconstitutional, a parliament committee
said in a report.  “There was no regard to whether the application to mine
would succeed or not,” the Legal Parliamentary Committee said
in a report obtained by Bloomberg News today. The fees “impose
a hefty financial burden on citizens and non-citizens alike who
opt to invest in the mining sector.”  Mines Minister  Obert Mpofu  raised mining fees and license
costs in a decree in February, requiring diamond miners to pay
as much as $5 million for a mining application. The legal
committee reviews laws and decrees to determine their compliance
with the constitution. Mpofu didn’t immediately respond to calls
seeking comment today.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , Zimbabwe Platinum Ltd.,
 Impala Platinum Ltd. (IMP)  and  Rio Tinto Plc (RIO)  are among Zimbabwe’s
biggest miners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
