Brown & Brown Inc. (BRO) , the family-run
insurance broker, gained the most since October as profit
climbed, beating estimates.  Brown & Brown jumped $1.40, or 5.8 percent, to close at
$25.44 in New York, the highest price since July 8.  First-quarter net income advanced 6.8 percent to $49.4
million, or 34 cents a share, beating by 1 cent the average
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Organic revenue,
which excludes results from recent acquisitions, rose 0.9
percent, the Daytona Beach, Florida-based company said in a
statement after markets closed yesterday.  Results “were better than we anticipated,” Chairman and
acting Chief Executive Officer J. Hyatt Brown said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
