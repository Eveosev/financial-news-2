Canal Plus ,  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s pay-
television unit, faces an investigation by France’s competition
authority over the purchase of Bollore Group’s television
assets, including the Direct 8 and Direct Star channels.  The deal, which would allow Canal Plus to extend its
presence into free television, raises “serious doubts” over
market competition and “requires that an in-depth probe be
opened,” the authority said in a  statement  on its website.  Such investigations normally last for 65 days, though they
can be extended, according to the statement.  Canal Plus spokeswoman Laurence Gallot wasn’t immediately
available to comment on the statement. The pay-tv company said
in September it had agreed to buy 60 percent of  Bollore (BOL) ’s
television assets using Vivendi shares, valuing the assets at a
maximum of 465 million euros ($611 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
