A slowdown in output from mines
will push the lead ore market into deficit as early as 2016 due
to insufficient investment, said Paulo Cabrejos, commercial
manager at  Volcan Cia. Minera SAA. (VOLCABC1)   The shortfall may come earlier if planned new mines in
“complicated places” such as Iran, Algeria or Argentina are
delayed, Cabrejos said at a Metal Bulletin conference in Warsaw
today. “Secondary production will be more and more important,
especially in  developing countries ,” he said.  The market for lead concentrate should reach a deficit of
about 146,000 metric tons in 2016, Cabrejos estimates. Refined
lead output will exceed demand by 97,000 tons this year,
compared with a 157,000 ton surplus last year, according to a
report by  Barclays Capital  on April 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
