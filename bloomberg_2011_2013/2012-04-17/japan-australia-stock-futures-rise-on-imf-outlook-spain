Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  rose after the  International Monetary Fund  raised
economic forecasts and Spain sold more debt than targeted,
boosting the earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  American depositary receipts of Sony Corp., Japan’s No. 1
exporter of consumer electronics that gets a fifth of its
revenue in Europe, added 1.4 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,
Japan’s second-biggest lender by market value, rose 2 percent.
ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s largest mining company
and Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, advanced 1.1 percent after
metal and oil prices gained.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 9,600 in Chicago yesterday, up from 9,450 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,610 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index added 1.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained
0.5 percent in Wellington.  “The environment for equities is pretty good,” said
Donald Williams, chief investment officer at Platypus Asset
Management Ltd. in Sydney, which manages about $1 billion.
“Even though 2012 is going to be a tough year because most of
Europe will be in recession for a large part of this calendar
year, you are still looking at a global growth rate of 3.5
percent, which is a pretty decent growth rate.”  IMF Growth Forecast  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index gained 1.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday after the IMF raised its 2012 global growth estimate
to 3.5 percent and Spanish bonds gained following a bill sale.
Expectations that Europe’s debt crisis is stabilizing outweighed
data that showed production at U.S. factories dropped in March
for the first time in four months and builders broke ground on
fewer houses than forecast.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum rose 0.8 percent
yesterday. Crude oil for May delivery advanced $1.27 to $104.20
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since April 2.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. climbed 1.2 percent yesterday to
102.80.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  advanced 8.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 10.6 percent gain by the  S&P
500  and a 6.1 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.3 times for the S&P 500
and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
