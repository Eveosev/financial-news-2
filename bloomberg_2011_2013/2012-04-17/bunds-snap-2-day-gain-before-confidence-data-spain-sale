German  government bonds  fell for
the first time in three days as stocks advanced before a report
that economists said will show investor confidence in  Europe ’s
largest economy stayed near a 21-month high in April.  The 10-year bund yield rose by the most in almost a week as
Spain raised more than its maximum target at a sale of 12- and
18-month bills. Spanish and Italian government bonds advanced
and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.8 percent, damping
demand for the safety of German fixed-income assets. Spanish
securities fell yesterday and the cost of insuring them against
default surged to a record.  “We have seen some sour sentiment in the previous days and
now we are seeing some calm” in Europe’s bond markets, said
Niels From, chief analyst at  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  in Copenhagen. “In
general we have seen the ZEW surprise on the upside and there is
some hope that the German economy is remaining strong.”  German  10-year bond yields  increased three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.75 percent at 9:44 a.m. London time.
The rate dropped to 1.639 percent on April 10, within a basis
point of a record low reached in September. Rates climbed as
much as four basis points today, the biggest increase since
April 11. The price of the 1.75 percent security due July 2022
fell 0.27, or 2.70 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,315) face amount, to
100.04.  Two-year note yields were at 0.15 percent, after reaching
an all-time low of 0.091 percent on April 10.  ZEW Index  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research will say
today its index of investor and analyst expectations for the
economy was at 19 in April after reaching 22.3 in March,
according to the median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Last month’s reading was the highest since June 2010.  Spain ’s two-year rate slid 14 basis points to 3.50 percent.
The 10-year yield dropped 13 basis points to 5.94 percent, after
jumping yesterday to 6.16, the most since Dec. 1. Italy’s  10-
year yields  declined seven basis points to 5.52 percent, while
its two-year note yields fell 13 basis points to 3.23 percent.  Spain sold 3.18 billion euros of bills today, compared with
a maximum target of 3 billion euros the Treasury set for the
sale.  The nation’s 10-year yields have still climbed almost 1
percentage point this year amid concern the nation may become
the next euro-region member to seek external aid. It plans to
sell 2.5 billion euros of bonds on April 19.  German Auction  It would be “desirable” for the  European Central Bank  to
follow a more expansionary policy as the government implements
austerity measures, Spanish Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria
said in an interview on RNE today. He also said Spain ruled out
seeking a bailout, even as the threat of losing access to
markets makes budget cuts necessary.  Germany  will sell two-year notes tomorrow, while  France 
plans to auction two-, three- and five-year securities and
inflation-linked debt on April 19.  The two-year German yield, which is consolidating near the
April 10 record low of 0.091 percent, will meet resistance
should it rise to the April 12 high of 0.163 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Resistance refers to an area on
yield charts where orders to buy a security may be grouped.  German bonds returned 1.1 percent so far this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
dropped 2.5 percent, while Italy’s rallied 8.7 percent, the
indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
