A weaker euro “is good news for
Europe” because of the boost it gives exports, French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  said.  Sarkozy said increasing contacts between the  European
Central Bank  and euro-zone governments to coordinate policies
wouldn’t hurt the central bank’s independence. “Do you know
that officials from the Fed lunch regularly with members of the
U.S. government,” he asked in an interview on France Inter
radio. “All I ask is they talk.”  He said that action by the ECB can’t replace steps to cut
debt. “If the ECB’s efforts are ever seen as a chance to avoid
our responsibilities, then the ECB will never act,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
