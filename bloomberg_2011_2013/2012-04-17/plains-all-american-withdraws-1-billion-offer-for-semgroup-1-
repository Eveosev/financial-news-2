  Plains All American Pipeline LP (PAA) ,
the pipeline company that ships more than 3 million barrels a
day over its network, withdrew a $1 billion unsolicited offer to
buy rival  SemGroup Corp. (SEMG)  after being rebuffed by the board.  Plains didn’t give a reason for dropping the $24-a-share
cash offer and said in a statement today it wouldn’t comment
further. SemGroup’s shares haven’t closed below $24.75 since the
bid was announced. In December, Houston-based Plains agreed to
buy  BP Plc (BP/) ’s natural gas liquids network in Canada for $1.67
billion in cash.  Plains, which owns 16,000 miles (25,750 kilometers) of
pipelines, disclosed the offer in an Oct. 24 letter to
SemGroup’s management. Tulsa, Oklahoma-based SemGroup rejected
Plains’ offer Oct. 19, saying it was too low.  SemGroup, which owns 2,800 miles of pipelines and storage
terminals that can hold 18.1 million barrels of fuel, adopted a
shareholder rights plan in October that would make it more
difficult for an acquirer to buy more than 10 percent of the
company without the board’s approval.  Liz Barclay, a spokeswoman for SemGroup, and Roy Lamoreaux,
a spokesman for Plains, didn’t return phone messages seeking
comment.  Plains rose 0.4 percent to $79.51 at the close in  New York .
SemGroup gained 1.1 percent to $29.90.  To contact the reporter on this story:
