The  European Central Bank  said it
drained 214 billion euros ($281 billion) in seven-day term
deposits to neutralize the liquidity created by its government
bond purchase program.  The Frankfurt-based central bank said 75 banks submitted
bids totaling 438 billion euros. The ECB sterilizes its
government bond purchases to ensure they donâ€™t fuel inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
