Thomas P. Campbell, director of the
 Metropolitan Museum of Art , was paid $1.04 million in salary and
benefits in 2010, when attendance at  New York ’s most-visited
museum rose to its highest level in four decades.  Total compensation increased 12 percent, according to the
Met’s 2010-2011  tax return . Campbell, 49, earned $653,402 in
salary, up 2 percent. Housing, retirement and other benefits
were valued by the museum at $389,051. He was named director in
January 2009.  Harold Holzer, a spokesman, attributed the increase in
benefits to Campbell’s move, with his family, in September 2009
into a museum-owned apartment on Fifth Avenue across from the
museum. Campbell lives rent-free in the apartment, which he uses
for Met-related entertaining and events. Campbell’s travel
wasn’t part of compensation, Holzer said.  The pay for the Oxford-educated former tapestry curator was
in line with comparable top museum jobs.  Glenn Lowry , head of
the Museum of  Modern Art , had compensation of $1.6 million in
2009. (MoMA hasn’t yet disclosed 2010 pay.)  Emily Rafferty, the Met’s president, earned $892,802 in pay
and benefits. That’s up 5 percent from a year earlier and triple
what she earned a decade ago as senior vice president for
external affairs.  McQueen Exhibit  Attendance in the year ending in June 2011 was 5.7 million,
up 9 percent, buoyed by a hugely popular exhibit of clothes and
accessories by the late fashion designer Alexander McQueen.
(Attendance includes visitors to the Cloisters Museum and
Gardens in upper  Manhattan .)  Raul Avila Inc ., a New York event planning firm, received
$1.3 million in connection with the Met’s Costume Institute gala
in May 2011. Holzer said the money involves payment to a wood
manufacturer, tent maker and other subcontractors.  The Met recently opened its renovated Islamic art galleries
and a new American wing, featuring Emanuel Leutze’s iconic 1851
painting “Washington Crossing the  Delaware .”  Campbell’s predecessor, Philippe de Montebello, crossed the
seven-figure threshold in 2005-2006, when his compensation was
listed at $4.6 million. Most of the money was for a retirement
plan after three decades in the job.  Today’s Muse highlights includes  watches  at Sotheby’s.  To contact the reporter of this story:
