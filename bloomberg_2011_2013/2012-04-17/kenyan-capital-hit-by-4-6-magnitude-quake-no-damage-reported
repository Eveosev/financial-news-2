Kenya ’s capital, Nairobi, was
struck by an earthquake measuring 4.6 on the Richter scale, the
Meteorological Department said.  The  tremor  struck at about 5 a.m. today in Limuru on the
outskirts of the city, Peter Macharia, the assistant director
for earthquake monitoring, said in a phone interview.  “The center was around Limuru area” and was felt in the
town of Nakuru, 137 kilometers (86 miles) northwest of Nairobi,
as well as the towns of Nyeri and Machakos, he said. “So far
there is no damage reported.”  Kenya is traversed by the East African Rift System, a
geological formation that stretches more than 3,000 kilometers
from northern neighbour Ethiopia to southern  Africa . The system,
which is as wide as 60 kilometers at some points, is a zone of
active volcanoes and fault lines, and is the main source of
seismic activity in Kenya, according to the Meteorological
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
