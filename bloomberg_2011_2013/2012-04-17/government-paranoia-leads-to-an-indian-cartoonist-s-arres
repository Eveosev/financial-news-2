States are granted the power to arrest or detain citizens. It follows that governments, which represent the state but are congregations of human actors, should exercise extreme self-restraint in depriving human beings of their liberty, and in particular never use the state's power to settle personal scores. All these foundational axioms of democratic civility and integrity were thrown to the wind last week by the chief minister of West Bengal,  Mamata Banerjee , and her party, the Trinamool Congress,  when they swooped down upon and incarcerated a college professor  for the earthshaking crime of circulating an e-mail that contained a  cartoon  mocking Banerjee and two members of her party. The cartoon made fun of  Banerjee's recent gesture of firing India's railway minister , a Trinamool Congress member, for his decision to raise passenger fares. But as cartoons go, it was hard to imagine one more inoffensive (and indeed, limited in its appeal because of its labored allusions to a popular Bengali film)  than this . The  Indian Express  reported, in sentences that seemed straight out of a satire by  George Orwell  or Dario Fo: With this outrageous gesture of intimidation -- aimed, of course, not just at the hapless professor but at all those critical of the West Bengal government -- Banerjee squandered the last of the enormous political capital she had gained last May when  she toppled the moribund but all-pervading  Communist Party of India  (Marxist) after it had held power for 34 years. Although that victory, and Banerjee's war cry of "poriborton," or "change," were widely hailed both in West Bengal and the rest of  India , it was also recognized that Banerjee had an immense task ahead of her in overhauling a political, social and economic milieu disfigured by a generation of Communist rule. Just as revolutionaries are marked forever by the extremity of their methods and the unshakable certitude of their convictions, so too Banerjee's government has been marked by the hubris and paranoia of the very regime that she unseated, democratically (and therefore not decisively). Among the many reasons why her witch hunt was unwise was that it laid a precedent for the politics of vendetta -- for Banerjee herself to be arrested, in a different time, with a different government in power, for any act of criticism or gesture of ridicule she might herself make. Nothing revealed the McCarthyite turn of Banerjee's government more than  Mahapatra's testimony that , when he was assaulted by four Trinamool Congress supporters, they sought to paint him into a narrative of a conspiracy by the Communists: As these remarks show, there was very little criticism of Banerjee from any member of her own party -- yet another depressing instance of the core of despotism that lurks inside political parties within the larger frame and context of Indian democracy. It was left to newspapers and columnists to supply the simple but necessary acts of resistance to Banerjee's whimsicality and bad faith. The Telegraph of Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal,  republished the cartoon  on its front page. And in a piece in the same paper called " The Moral Minefield ," the novelist Ruchir Joshi wrote: Pathetic though it was, it would be unfair to see Banerjee's gesture as an isolated instance of censorship and intimidation by India's government. The inability to digest criticism or ridicule, and a suspicion of the subversive power and global reach of the Internet, is shared by many stuffed shirts in Indian politics, and across the political spectrum. In September last year,  a newspaper cartoonist was arrested by the government  run by the  Bharatiya Janata Party  in  Madhya Pradesh  for a cartoon of the Chief Minister of Gujarat  Narendra Modi , another politician susceptible to megalomania. And late last year India's Communications and IT Minister  Kapil Sibal  threatened to crack down on Google and Facebook  for hosting offensive content , demanding most unreasonably that they employ staff to prescreen content.  Heather Timmons reported last December : So it was no surprise to read  a report that the West Bengal police had , in the wake of l'affaire Banerjee, decided to write "to Facebook authorities in the US, requesting them to delete malicious web contents (sic) circulated on the social networking site against Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other Trinamool leaders." Good luck with that. Indeed, when Shivam Vij wrote, quite correctly, last December that " Kapil Sibal doesn't understand the Internet, " that thought could have been extended to most Indian politicians, who (being  usually of a ripe old age  themselves) came of age in a pre-Internet public culture and can't think of a world of freely circulated opinion beyond newspapers, with their bows to propriety and civility. Hopelessly left behind in a world where ideas zip around and catch fire in seconds in the de-hierarchized spaces of e-mail, Facebook, Twitter (where the Mamata cartoon went viral, and  generated links to many new Mamata cartoons Â -- including this  delightful one ), most Indian politicians are still stuck in the 20th century. And some, like Banerjee, are still fighting wars against real and imaginary Communists. (Chandrahas Choudhury, a novelist, is the New Delhi correspondent for the World View blog.
