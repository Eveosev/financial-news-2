Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
Brazil’s second-largest airline, rose the most in eight months
on speculation the government may cut taxes to help the
industry.  Gol  gained  11 percent to 11.38 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo, the steepest one-day advance since Aug. 9. It was the
best performer on the benchmark Bovespa index, which rose 1.2
percent.  Brazil’s government may cut the payroll and aircraft fuel
taxes to boost airlines’ competitiveness, Sao Paulo-based
newspaper Valor Economico reported, without saying where it got
the information.  “Those are the main costs for airlines,” Leonardo Nitta,
an analyst at  Banco do Brasil SA (BBAS3) , said by telephone today. “A
reduction of those costs would certainly be positive for the
airlines.”  The  Finance Ministry  declined to comment on Valor’s report
in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
