Poland  sold a total of 825 million
Swiss francs ($900 million) of bonds for its biggest transaction
in the currency in almost five years.  The government sold 375 million francs of floating-rate
notes due August 2015 at a yield of 125 basis points over the
 three-month franc London interbank offered rate , a banker with
knowledge of the deal said. Poland also sold 450 million francs
of fixed-rate bonds due in May 2018 at 170 basis points over
mid-swaps, according a banker, who did not want to be named as
the information is not public.  This price would give yields of about 1.36 percent for the
2015 notes and 2.31 percent for the 2018 bond, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The deal was managed by  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Deutsche
Bank AG, the  Finance Ministry  said on its website today. The
government planned to sell minimum of 200 million francs of 2018
bonds and 250 million francs of three-year notes, according to
bankers. The total value of the offering was the biggest since
May 2007 when Poland raised 1 billion francs, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Poland and current euro member Slovakia have been the only
emerging-market governments to sell debt in francs since 2008,
when Hungary raised 150 million francs from a 2013 bond.
Developing nations have raised 8.3 billion francs in bonds since
1999, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Poland has
accounted for 6 billion francs of that total.  Poland sold 350 million of franc bonds due in 2016 in
February last year. The bonds fell today, pushing the yield up
three basis points to 1.89 percent at 4:15 p.m. in Warsaw.  The yield fell to 1.8 percent on April 10, the lowest since
they were sold and down from as high as 3.18 percent in April
last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
