U.S. Bancorp (USB) , the nation’s fifth-
largest lender by deposits, reported a 28 percent increase in
first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as revenue
rose and credit losses fell.  Net income climbed to $1.34 billion, or 67 cents a share,
from $1.05 billion, or 52 cents, a year earlier, the
Minneapolis-based bank said today in a statement. Earnings beat
the 64-cent  average estimate  of 31 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Richard Davis , 54, is seeking to
take market share in small-business banking in anticipation of
an upswing in the  U.S. economy . U.S. Bancorp,  Minnesota ’s
largest bank, said in March it was increasing its quarterly
dividend 56 percent to 19.5 cents a share after the  Federal
Reserve  reviewed the lender’s proposed capital plan.  “The slow, but steady, economic recovery contributed to
the continued improvement in our  credit quality  this quarter,”
Davis said in the statement.  U.S. Bancorp rose 56 cents to $31.72 in early trading at
7:34 a.m. in New York. The bank’s shares gained 15 percent this
year through yesterday, compared with a 21 percent increase in
the KBW Bank Index of 24 U.S. lenders.  Revenue grew 9.1 percent to $4.93 billion as mortgage
banking more than doubled to $452 million from $199 million in
the year-earlier period.  Charge-Offs Decline  U.S. Bancorp set aside $481 million for soured loans in the
first quarter, a 36 percent drop from the same period last year.
Total net charge-offs also declined, falling to $571 million
from $805 million.  The bank’s total loans increased by 6.4 percent to $210.2
billion as commercial loans and residential mortgages grew.
Total commercial loans increased to $57.1 billion from $48.7
billion, and residential mortgages rose to $37.8 billion from
$31.8 billion.  Non-interest expense rose 11 percent to $2.56 billion. U.S.
Bancorp’s net interest margin, the difference between what a
bank pays to borrow money and what it gets for loans, fell to
3.6 percent in the first quarter from 3.69 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
