Federal Reserve  officials are
grappling with how they might eventually exit from their plan to
keep interest rates low through late 2014 without jolting
markets.  Policy makers have relied on communications about their
rate expectations to provide additional stimulus after cutting
their benchmark rate to  near zero  in December 2008. Now, they’re
seeking to link their commitment more closely to changes in the
economic outlook. Giving investors more information about the
threshold for a shift would make it easier to change policy,
said  Ethan Harris , co-head of global economics research at Bank
of America Merrill Lynch.  “When you present scenarios, you’re showing the public
that you will react; or in other words, if inflation becomes a
problem, you will hike rates earlier,” Harris said. “If you
guide the markets in advance and explain to them the reaction
function, then they’ll kind of do your job for you,” so policy
makers won’t “have to actually hike to convince the markets
that they’re hiking.”  There’s little indication the  Federal Open Market Committee 
is ready to alter its 2014 plan, with the jobless rate at 8.2
percent, well above its 5 percent to 6 percent estimate for full
employment. Two top policy makers, William C. Dudley, president
of the Federal Reserve Bank of  New York , and Fed Vice Chairman
 Janet Yellen , both endorsed the commitment last week.  The FOMC’s decision to connect the plan more clearly to its
outlook might gain urgency if the economy continues to expand
following gains in the labor market, sales and manufacturing.  Rising Retail Sales  Retail sales added to signs that growth is strengthening,
with last month’s  0.8 percent  gain almost three times as large
as projected, according to Commerce Department data released
yesterday. The increase shows consumers are weathering a 19
percent rise in gasoline since Dec. 31. The average price for a
gallon of regular unleaded was $3.91 on April 15, down from
$3.94 on April 5, according to AAA, the nation’s largest
motoring group.  “We are going to have to deal with it one way or
another,”  Charles Plosser , president of the  Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia , told reporters last week, referring to the
2014 forecast. “I would like to get us to move away from that
and substitute something that is a little more systematic and
coherent about how it depends on the economy.”  Plosser is a member of the Fed’s communications
subcommittee, which is having “ongoing discussions,” he said,
without indicating that any changes are imminent. The Fed meets
April 24-25.  ‘More Transparent’  “The FOMC so far has become more transparent about its
objectives, more transparent about its policy plans, but there
is one more objective it hasn’t met and that is to become more
transparent about its policy strategy,” said  Laurence Meyer ,
senior managing director at Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in
Washington and a former Fed governor.  To do this, the FOMC might release different interest-rate
paths that correspond to changes in inflation or employment,
although members aren’t likely to reach an agreement next week,
Meyer said.  The minutes of the March FOMC meeting show they’ve already
begun talking about ways to include more quantitative or
qualitative information in the statement to provide a tighter
link between their outlook and monetary policy.  Fed officials started tying their low borrowing-cost
expectations to the calendar in August, when they replaced their
statement that the rate for overnight loans among banks would
stay very low for an “extended period” with a date of at least
mid-2013. They pushed that date back to at least late 2014 in
January.  Signs of Strength  With the economy showing signs of strength and central
bankers giving no sign another round of bond purchases is
imminent, communication probably will be the main policy tool,
according to Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac
River Capital, a  Washington  hedge fund that manages $250
million. The Fed bought $2.3 trillion in Treasury, federal-
agency and mortgage-backed securities in two asset-purchase
programs that ended in June.  “They are done with quantitative easing,” barring
significant further weakness in the economy, Spindel said. “All
of the effort is going to be on guidance: What date, how do they
describe it, do they want to conditionalize it, do they want to
lengthen it or shorten it?”  Europe’s Debt Crisis  Some of the world’s biggest bond investors, including
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross , still predict
the Fed will use its balance sheet for more stimulus as growth
weakens and  Europe ’s sovereign debt-crisis returns. Speculation
the Fed will buy home-loan bonds has led 2012 returns on
government-backed mortgage debt to top Treasuries by 0.95
percentage point, Barclays Plc index data show.  Money-market-derivatives traders predict the Fed will lift
its target a few months before the late 2014 forecast. Forward
markets for overnight index swaps, whose rates show what traders
expect the federal-funds effective rate will average over the
life of the contract, signal a quarter-percentage point advance
around July 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of
April 13.  Yellen outlined on April 11 scenarios that might warrant a
policy shift. For example, if the recovery is “unexpectedly
strong” and unemployment is on track to fall to 6 percent at
the end of 2014 with inflation creeping above 2 percent, that
would call for the Fed to raise rates sooner than the current
commitment.  Appropriate to Modify  “The guidance does not state that the committee will keep
the funds rate exceptionally low until at least late 2014,” she
said in a speech. “I’d consider it completely appropriate to
modify the specification of the forward guidance in response to
significant changes in the economic outlook.”  A weaker outcome would merit low rates for longer than 2014
and further easing steps “could be warranted,” she added.  Since becoming chairman in 2006,  Ben S. Bernanke  has pushed
for the central bank to increase its openness and increase
public understanding of the Fed, including by holding regular
press conferences. In January, the Fed adopted an explicit
inflation target of 2 percent and released, for the first time,
policy makers’  projections  for the appropriate path of  interest
rates . They will update those projections after their meeting
next week.  “This is the whole Bernanke transparency approach: ‘Let’s
be as public as possible about what assumptions we’re making so
that people understand that what we’re doing is logical and
consistent,’” said Harris, author of “ Ben Bernanke ’s Fed: The
Federal Reserve After Greenspan.” “You tell the markets the
way you act and then the markets move in front of you because
you’ve explained it.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
