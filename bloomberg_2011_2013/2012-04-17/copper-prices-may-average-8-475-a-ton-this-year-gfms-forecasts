Copper may average $8,475 a metric
ton in 2012 as demand slows, with the weakest trading in the
first half of the year,  Thomson Reuters  GFMS said.  The metal used in pipes and wires will average $8,305 a ton
in the first half of the year because of slower economic growth
in China and  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis, the researcher said
in a report today. Copper for delivery in three months averaged
$8,328.57 a ton in the first quarter and yesterday fell to
$7,885.25 a ton, the lowest price since Jan. 13. It’s up 5
percent this year.  “There is a continued negative impact on sentiment and
consumption from the ongoing euro-zone crisis,” Sanjay Saraf,
research director for base metals at GFMS, said in the report.
“Recent data and reports from China indicate a cooling economy
and subdued demand conditions.”  Copper premiums in  China  over the price of the metal on 
exchanges fell to $50 to $90 a ton in the first quarter from
$120 to $150 a ton in the final three months of 2011 on slowing
economic growth, GFMS said. Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the
Shanghai Futures Exchange rose to 227,276 tons in March, the
highest since 2003. Stockpiles in bonded warehouses more
than tripled to 650,000 tons from November,  Barclays Capital 
estimates.  Premiums in Europe and the U.S. have rebounded in the last
few months because of improved demand, particularly in the U.S.,
and dwindling stockpiles, GFMS said. Inventories of copper in
warehouses monitored by the LME have dropped as much as 32 
percent this year, data from the bourse show.  Copper may “re-test” $9,000 a ton later this year on
higher demand and government steps to boost growth, 
according to the report.  Bloomberg competes with Thomson Reuters in selling
