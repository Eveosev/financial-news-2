Japan  is seeking to buy 139,237
metric tons of milling wheat from the U.S.,  Canada  and  Australia 
in a regular tender on April 19, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  The Australian wheat is for loading from June 1 to June 30,
while the U.S. grain is for loading from May 21 to June 20,
Toshiki Tojo at the ministry’s grain-trade division said by
phone today. The remainder is for arrival by July 31, he said.
The volume sought is the smallest since March 23, when the
government bought 133,792 tons.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest buyer as a
single entity. It bought 4.65 million tons through regular
tenders last fiscal year, compared with 5.16 million tons in the
year ended March 31, 2011. Details of this week’s tender are
listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
