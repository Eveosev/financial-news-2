Builders began work on fewer homes
than forecast in March, signaling a sustained industry recovery
will take time to get underway.  Housing starts dropped 5.8 percent to a 654,000 annual rate,
less than the lowest estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News and the least since October, Commerce Department figures
showed today in Washington. The slump was led by the volatile
multifamily category, which at the same time showed a jump in
permits, a proxy for future construction.  While warmer weather may have spurred  home construction  at
the beginning of 2012, a competing supply of  cheap  existing
properties may be steering potential buyers away from purchasing
a new home. That means home construction may not help boost the
economy in 2012.  “Housing continues to bump along the bottom,” said Jacob
Oubina, a senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets LLC in  New
York . “The best we can hope from housing over the next couple
years is that it won’t subtract from growth. The numbers in the
past few months were decidedly impacted by a much milder winter,
so a significant portion of construction was pulled forward.”  Stock-index futures held earlier gains after the report as
concern about  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis eased. The contract
on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in June climbed 0.6
percent to 1,371.7 at 8:42 a.m. in New York.  Survey Results  The median forecast in the Bloomberg survey called for a
705,000 rate. Estimates from the 82 economists ranged from
670,000 to 750,000. February’s building pace was revised to
694,000 from a previously reported rate of 698,000.  Building  permits  climbed 4.5 percent to a 747,000 annual
rate in March, the highest level since September 2008. They were
projected to drop to a 710,000 annual rate. Applications for
multifamily units increased 21 percent, while those for single-
family houses, which account for about 70 percent of the market,
dropped 3.5 percent.  Construction of single-family houses eased 0.2 percent to a
462,000 rate. Work on multifamily homes, which include townhouses
and apartment buildings, dropped 17 percent to an annual rate of
192,000. The decrease followed gains of 13 percent and 17 percent
in the prior two months.  The decrease in starts was focused in the South, where
builders began work on 16 percent fewer houses. Construction was
little changed in the West and rose 33 percent in the Northeast
and 1 percent in the Midwest.  Record Warmth  Record-breaking warm weather may have contributed to the
surge in construction in the Northeast last month. The average
temperature in the U.S. was 51.1 degrees Fahrenheit (10.6
Celsius), 38.6 degrees warmer than the 20th century average and
the hottest reported March in records going back to 1895,
according to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .  Even so, low borrowing costs and better job prospects should
support demand for new homes. The average rate on a 30-year fixed
mortgage  reached  an all-time low of 3.87 percent in February and
was just a point higher at 3.88 percent in the week ended April
12, according to data from  Freddie Mac .  Buyers “are starting to feel pressure not to miss this
moment,”  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  Chief Executive Officer Stuart Miller said
during a March 27 conference call with analysts. “The fully-
loaded cost of ownership is lower in the most-desirable markets
than comparable rental rates.”  More Orders  New-home orders increased 33 percent in the three months
ended Feb. 29, the third-largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue
said. Shares of the Miami-company rose to the highest level since
2007 after it reported the orders growth and net income that beat
estimates.  Nonetheless, without the benefit of milder weather and
further income growth, activity pick up much faster for the
residential  construction industry . Homebuilder confidence fell in
April as buyer traffic diminished, according to the  National
Association of Home Builders . The Washington-based group’s index
of sentiment  slid  to 25 this month. Readings lower than 50 mean
more respondents still said conditions were poor.  Existing homes are also offering a cheaper alternative to
new properties. The difference between the median price of an
existing and new single-family house was more than $76,000 in
February, near the widest gap on record and more than $50,000
larger than when the recession began in December 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
