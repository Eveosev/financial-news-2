Spin bowler Nathan Lyon took five
wickets in the final session to leave the West Indies at 252-9
in reply to  Australia ’s first-innings 311 on day three of the
second cricket Test in Trinidad.  Lyon ended the rain-affected day at Queen’s Park Oval in
Port of  Spain  with bowling figures of 5-68, including the wicket
of Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who top scored with 94. The home team
had reached 230-4 before Lyon ripped through the lower order to
secure his second five-wicket haul in Tests.  Carlton Baugh was 17 not out at stumps, with Fidel
Edwards yet to score.  Australia leads by 59 runs with two days to play as it
seeks an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three series after
winning the opening Test by three wickets.  The final match in Dominica starts April 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
