Thirteen  Patek Philippe  timepieces,
which had belonged to collector Henry Graves Jr., are coming to
the auction block at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in June.  Born to a banking family, Graves (1868-1953) amassed about
40 extraordinary watches over four decades, commissioning some
of the most complex pieces ever made.  His 1933 Patek Philippe “The Henry Graves
Supercomplication” fetched $11 million at Sotheby’s in 1999,
the highest price ever paid for a timepiece at auction.  The 13 Graves watches, which have never been published or
appeared on the market, will be offered at Sotheby’s on June 14
in New York.  “It’s like finding a dozen Picassos from the finest
Picasso collector sitting in a closet,” said  John Reardon ,
Sotheby’s head of watches in New York.  The watches come from the estate of Graves’s grandson
Reginald “Pete” Fullerton, Jr., who died last month.  Fullerton inherited his grandfather’s zeal for timepieces,
assembling a collection of his own. His 41 Patek Philippe and
 Breguet  wristwatches will be included in the auction as well.  Here are the highlights:  Graves’s yellow gold barrel-shaped, minute-repeating
wristwatch by Patek Philippe is engraved with his family’s coat
of arms, including the Latin motto “Esse quam videri” (“To
be, rather than to seem.”) The estimate: $600,000 to $800,000.  On June 5, 1926, the day of Graves’s daughter Gwendolyn’s
wedding, the banker gave his son-in-law an inscribed 18-karat
gold Patek Philippe pocket watch with a minute repeater. Press a
tiny button and listen to its gentle chime. It’s the same sound
Graves heard almost a century ago. The estimate: $40,000 to
$60,000.  One timepiece is concealed inside a gold $20-coin from
1904. Barely visible along its ridge is a faint rectangular
shape. Press it. The cover will pop open to reveal an elegant
dial inside. The estimate: $10,000 to $15,000.  The Fullerton collection includes 11 iconic perpetual
calendar watches by Patek Philippe from the 1950s to the 1990s.  One was the prototype of the company’s popular reference
2497 and the first major wristwatch Fullerton bought. Made with
18-karat yellow gold, it cost $1,000 in 1960. The estimate:
$200,000 to $300,000.  Perpetual Calendar  Another perpetual calendar model, reference 3450, features
unusual white enamel dial. Fullerton bought it at Sotheby’s in
1990 for $41,000, without buyer’s premium. It’s currently valued
at $200,000 to $300,000.  Fullerton kept all the watches in leather boxes near his
room, winding them once a day, Reardon said.  “Within 24 hours after he wound them up for the last time,
they stopped,” he said.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
