Gambian President Yahya Jammeh
appointed Fisheries and Water Resources Minister Abdou Colley as
the West African countryâ€™s finance minister, replacing Mambury
Njie two months after appointing a new Cabinet.  Njie becomes foreign minister, replacing Mamadou Tangara,
who has moved to the Fisheries Ministry, according to a
statement read on state television yesterday in Banjul, the
capital. Jammeh also replaced Interior Minister Sheriff Gomez
with Kaba Bajo, it said.  Jammeh won a fourth term in office in November, extending
his 17-year rule of Gambia, which is bordered on three sides by
 Senegal .  To contact the reporter on this story:
