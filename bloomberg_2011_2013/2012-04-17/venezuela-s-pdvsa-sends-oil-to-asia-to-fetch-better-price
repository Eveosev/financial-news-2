Petroleos de Venezuela SA , the
state oil company, gets a higher oil price by selling crude to
 Asia  rather than the U.S. and will continue to diversify its
export markets, said company president  Rafael Ramirez .  Venezuela’s growing exports to Asia accounts for the
country’s export basket price being above U.S. benchmark West
Texas Intermediate crude, Ramirez said today at an event in
Caracas. West Texas Intermediate crude on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  currently sells for about 11 percent less
than Brent oil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We don’t sell discounted oil to anyone,” Ramirez said
today. “We get more for oil that we ship to Asia than we get
from oil that we sell to the U.S. and are sending more oil and
fuel oil to  China  as a result.”  Venezuela,  South America ’s largest oil producer, curtails
production to comply with its OPEC quota and keep oil prices
from falling, Ramirez said. The country plans to produce an
average of 3.13 million barrels a day of oil in 2012 and end the
year with daily production capacity of 3.5 million barrels, said
Ramirez, who is also the country’s oil and mining minister.  “We’re worried about stability in oil prices and working
to construct a price floor of $100 a barrel. We see some OPEC
countries producing more than their quotas,” Ramirez told
reporters. “Rising inventories are a terrible signal that there
is over production.”  The country’s oil export price fell 1 percent in the week
ending April 13 to $113.85 from $115.01 the prior week.  Crude Production  Venezuela ’s price is above West Texas Intermediate crude
oil for May delivery, which advanced $1.27, or 1.2 percent, to
$104.20 a barrel at 2:05 p.m.  Brent oil for June settlement rose 32 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $119 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is called, averaged
production of 2.99 million barrels of oil a day last year, a 0.5
percent increase from 2010, the company said today in a
presentation on its 2011 financial results. Exports rose 2.2
percent to 2.5 million barrels a day.  PDVSA will need to raise 81 percent of the $236 billion
that the company wants to invest through 2018 and its partners
will raise 19 percent, the minister said today in a
presentation.  The company has no plans to sell new dollar-denominated
bonds at the moment, Ramirez said without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
