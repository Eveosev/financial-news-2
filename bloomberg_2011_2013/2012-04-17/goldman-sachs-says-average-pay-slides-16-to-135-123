Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by  assets , set aside $4.4 billion to pay
employees in the first quarter, 16 percent less than a year
earlier, as revenue fell and the company cut jobs.  The amount, which covers salaries, benefits and accruals
for year-end bonuses, is enough to give each of the firm’s
32,400 employees $135,123. A year earlier, the New York-based
firm’s $5.23 billion first-quarter compensation expense equaled
$147,825 for each of the 35,400 employees at the time.  Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, led by Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, are reducing jobs and
compensation to preserve profit.  Europe ’s debt crisis and new
regulations have weighed on trading revenue, while slow economic
growth limited fees for takeovers and financing.  “The dynamic for the trading companies has changed -- I
just don’t think they’re going to be able to make the kind of
money they used to make,”  Mark Bronzo , a portfolio manager who
helps oversee $125 billion for Guggenheim Investments in
Irvington,  New York , said before the figures were released.  The sum set aside by Goldman Sachs equals 44 percent of
revenue, about the same as in the first quarter of 2011.
Blankfein, 57, received a 35 percent cut in his own compensation
for last year to $12.4 million after earnings dropped 47 percent
and the stock tumbled 46 percent.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the biggest U.S. lender by assets,
awarded CEO  Jamie Dimon  $23 million in pay and bonuses for 2011
after the company reported record earnings. Compensation at
JPMorgan’s investment bank fell 12 percent to $2.9 billion in
the first quarter, according to figures posted on the New York-
based firm’s website last week.  The expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits,
was enough to pay each of the division’s 25,707 workers an
average of $112,849 for the first three months of the year.  Wall Street firms typically set aside a portion of revenue
throughout the year for bonuses, enabling companies to increase
or decrease pay in line with performance. Average pay is derived
by dividing total compensation and benefits by the number of
employees and doesn’t represent what workers actually receive.  To contact the reporters on this story:
