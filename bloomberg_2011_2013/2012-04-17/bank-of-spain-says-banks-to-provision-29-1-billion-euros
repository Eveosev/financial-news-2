Spanish banks will set aside a
total of 53.8 billion euros ($71 billion) to meet new rules on
real estate, the Bank of  Spain  said, as it pledged to tighten
vigilance over lenders struggling to meet the requirements.  Lenders will take provisions of 29.1 billion euros and
create a capital buffer of 15.6 billion euros, after making
“extraordinary writedowns” of 9.19 billion euros at the end of
last year, the Bank of Spain said today in a  statement  released
in  Madrid . The government previously estimated that the total
would be about 52 billion euros.  Spain’s government passed a decree in February that forced
banks to recognize deeper losses on the real estate piled up on
their books since the collapse of the property boom in 2008. The
government is seeking to restore investor confidence in Spain
and its lenders by boosting banks’ capital requirements.  “The cleanup required by the new Royal Decree-Law has
already been or will be carried out by most  credit institutions 
without major difficulty,” the Bank of Spain said. In other
cases compliance will be “more exacting but reasonably likely
to be met,” it said.  In those cases, the Bank of Spain will “tighten
monitoring” of the lenders and has told them to take extra
contingency measures, it said, without naming any companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
