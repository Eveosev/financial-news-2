The international community must
increase sanctions on the Syrian government, forcing it to
accept the United Nations-brokered cease-fire it has flouted,
French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe  said.  “We must maintain pressure on the Syrian regime: that
means strengthening sanctions,” Juppe said at the start of a
58-country “Friends of  Syria ” meeting in Paris.  Juppe told the meeting that sanctions against the
government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which have been
imposed on 150 people and entities, have cut the country’s
financial reserves in half. He didn’t provide any figures.  At the end of today’s meeting, the group said it would
convene again next month in  Washington . The final statement
offered to lift sanctions on Syrian businesspeople who can show
they have broken links with the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
