Wealthy New York-area households
that benefited from a decade-long break on federal individual
income taxes stand to lose the most if the Bush-era tax cuts are
repealed next year.  Among U.S. households making more than $200,000, filers in
Fairfield County,  Connecticut  paid the top effective individual
 income  tax rate in the nation at 25.6 percent, according to
Internal Revenue Service data compiled by Bloomberg. The wealthy
in  Manhattan  paid 24.9 percent. Those in Essex County,  New
Jersey , handed over 24.3 percent of their income to the
government. The average U.S. household that made more than
$200,000 paid an effective rate of 22.6 percent in 2008, the
latest year for which data are available.  Among that group of higher-income households, New Yorkers
had the highest average adjusted gross income in the nation,
$1.01 million. Their average capital gains, $200,376, trailed
only Palm Beach County,  Florida ’s $207,838 average.  The figures highlight how wealthy taxpayers benefit from
breaks set to expire next year by paying a far lower rate on
income from investments and dividends than the 35 percent rate
assessed on all taxable income over $388,350.  The wealthiest taxpayers “pay a lower rate, because so
much is  capital gains ,” Michael J. Graetz, a Columbia
University tax professor and former Treasury Department counsel,
said in a telephone interview. “But a lot of people earning
more than $200,000 are going to be paying full freight on income
from salaries.”  Political Capital  Mitt Romney , the front-runner for the 2012 Republican
presidential nomination, came under fire earlier this year for
reporting an effective tax rate of 13.9 percent. The former
Massachusetts governor paid $3 million in 2010 on earnings of
$21.6 million. He paid a top rate of 15 percent on more than
half his taxable income, rather than the 35 percent rate.  President  Barack Obama , who reported last week that his
family paid 20.5 percent on $790,000 in adjusted gross income,
campaigned for legislation that would have levied a minimum 30
percent tax on millionaires. The measure, which was defeated
yesterday in a procedural vote in the  U.S. Senate , would have
raised $47 billion over the next decade, according to an
estimate by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation last
month. The 51-45 Senate vote fell short of the 60 needed for the
bill to advance.  ‘The Buffett Rule’  The legislation was dubbed “the Buffett rule” after
billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett. Buffett, the chairman of
Omaha, Nebraska-based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , had complained
last year that his 17.7 percent effective tax rate was far lower
than the rate his secretary paid in individual income taxes.  Even without the bill, taxes on wealthy households could
still be raised at year’s end, when Bush-era tax cuts
automatically expire. The cuts, passed in 2001 and 2003, dropped
the marginal tax rates from 36 percent to 33 percent for
households making between $195,500 and $383,350, and reduced the
marginal rates from 39.6 percent to 35 percent for households
reporting more than $383,350 in earnings.  Wealthy Americans also face an increase in the capital
gains tax, which could rise to 25 percent from the current 15
percent as a result of the Bush cuts’ expiration, a provision in
Obama’s health-care overhaul and legislation that reduces the
value of high-income taxpayers’ personal exemption. Dividends
also would be treated as ordinary income if the tax cuts lapse.  ‘Raise Taxes Significantly’  Taxing dividends as ordinary income “will raise taxes
significantly,” said Curtis Dubay, senior analyst at the
 Heritage Foundation , a Washington-based research organization
that promotes conservative public policies, according to its
 website .  “You’re going to see a significant gain in effective tax
rates if that happens,” Dubay said in a telephone interview.  Individual income taxes made up 45.4 percent of all federal
revenue in 2008. IRS data show taxpayers claimed $271 billion in
deductions for state income taxes, $463.7 billion in mortgage
interest and $167.9 billion in property taxes.  New York taxpayers earning more than $200,000 a year had
the highest average amount of itemized deductions at $212,553
per household;  Santa Barbara  ranked second at $138,796, and  San
Francisco  was No. 3 with an average $138,611.  Three of the lowest effective rates were paid in Riverside
County,  California , where the typical wealthy taxpayer handed
over 19.5 percent of income to the government; San Bernardino,
California, at 20.2 percent; and Loudoun County,  Virginia , at
20.3 percent. Loudoun County, a suburb of  Washington , D.C.,
reported the lowest average capital gains in the nation among
wealthy households, with $18,340.  To contact the reporter on this story:
