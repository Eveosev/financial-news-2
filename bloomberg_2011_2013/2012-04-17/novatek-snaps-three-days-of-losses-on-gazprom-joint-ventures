OAO Novatek rose for the first day
in four after Russia’s second-biggest gas producer and OAO
Gazprom, the nation’s gas export monopoly, said they’re
considering joint ventures to develop Arctic gas fields and
boost planned production of liquefied natural gas.  Novatek’s shares added 0.6 percent to 376.53 rubles as of
11:27 a.m. in Moscow, headed for their strongest gain since
April 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
