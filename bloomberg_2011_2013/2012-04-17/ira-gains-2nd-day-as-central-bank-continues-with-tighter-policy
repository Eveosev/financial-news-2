The lira strengthened for a second
day after the central bank refrained from lending at its lowest
funding rate for a fifth day.  The Turkish currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.7917 per
dollar at 5:06 p.m. in Istanbul, heading for the strongest level
in almost two weeks. The  yield s on two-year benchmark debt were
unchanged at 9.42 percent.  The Ankara-based central bank withheld funding at the
lowest 5.75 percent rate in its daily one-week repo auctions
after the lira weakened to a three-week low, 1.8177, on April
10. It lent 2 billion liras ($1.1 billion) in today’s auction,
down from 3 billion liras due for repayment from last week’s
repurchase agreements, at an annual rate of 10.51 percent.  “The bank maintains its policy of ‘exceptional days’ with
determination and we expect the lira to trade strong today as a
result,” Ali Cakiroglu, a strategist at  HSBC Private Bank  in
Istanbul, said in an e-mailed note.  Turkey ’s central bank varies its funding rate on a daily
basis, maintaining borrowing costs within a 5.75 percent to 11.5
percent interest-rate corridor introduced last year. Days when
the bank does not lend at the 5.75 percent rate are considered
“exceptional days.” The current round of policy tightening
began on April 11 after the lira weakened to a three-week low at
1.8177 per dollar during intraday trade.  The current-account deficit in Turkey is about 10 percent
of gross domestic product, the biggest among 60 major economies
tracked by the  International Monetary Fund  as a proportion of
GDP. The country’s inflation rate is 10.4 percent, which is more
than twice the bank’s 5 percent target for this year.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
