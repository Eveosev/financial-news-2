Australia  said the majority of its
troops will withdraw from Afghanistan by 2014, following the
lead of plans announced by its allies in U.S. and Europe to exit
the Asian nation’s war.  Afghan President Hamid Karzai is expected to make an
announcement on the security transition in Uruzgan and other
provinces, a process that may take as long as 18 months, in
“the coming months,” Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard 
said in a speech in Canberra today.  “When transition is complete, Australia’s commitment in
Afghanistan will look very different to that we have today,”
Gillard said in the emailed text of the speech. “We will no
longer be conducting routine frontline operations with the
Afghan national security forces.”  Public and political support for the Afghan war, waning in
the U.S. and  Europe , has also been declining in Australia,
exacerbated by Taliban attacks such as those staged over the
weekend on the capital, Kabul, and three other cities. Last year
alone, 11 Australian soldiers were killed and 50 wounded in the
nation, Gillard said today.  President Barack Obama is planning to remove U.S. combat
forces by the end of 2014. A Washington Post-ABC News poll
published April 12 showed a record low of 30 percent of the
American public think the war has been worth fighting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
