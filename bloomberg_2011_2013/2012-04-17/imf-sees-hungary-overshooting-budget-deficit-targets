The  International Monetary Fund 
predicted  Hungary  will overshoot its budget deficit targets this
year and in 2013.  The shortfall may be 3 percent of gross domestic product in
2012 and 3.4 percent next year, according to the IMF’s  Fiscal
Monitor report , published today. The government is targeting a
2.5 percent budget gap this year and 2.2 percent in 2013.  The European Union last month partially froze Hungary’s
infrastructure-development aid from 2013, giving the country
until June 22 to take “effective” action to cut its budget
deficit and have the sanction lifted. The shortfall reached 90
percent of the government’s annual target in the first quarter.  The IMF said its forecasts are based on existing legislated
measures as well as the fiscal-policy plans announced by the
government through the end of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
