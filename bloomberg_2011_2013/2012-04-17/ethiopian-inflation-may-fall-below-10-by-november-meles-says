Inflation in  Ethiopia  is expected
to slow to less than 10 percent by November, Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi said.  The annual inflation rate in the Horn of Africa country
dropped to 32.5 percent in March from 36.3 percent in February,
according to data released by the Central Statistical Agency
last week.  “In the next coming months, this trend will continue,”
Meles told lawmakers today in Addis Ababa, the capital.
Inflation “will reach the goal of single figures” by November,
he said.  Ethiopia’s central bank stopped lending to the government
to help curb inflation, Meles said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
