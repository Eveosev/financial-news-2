U.S. stocks rose, giving benchmark
indexes the biggest rallies in a month, as higher forecasts from
the  International Monetary Fund  and gains in Spanish bonds
overshadowed declines in housing starts and factory production.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the most valuable technology company, surged
5.1 percent after yesterday capping its longest losing streak
since October.  Bank of America Corp.  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  added
more than 1.4 percent as European lenders jumped after Spain
sold more debt than targeted.  Coca-Cola Co. (KO) , rose 2.1 percent as
earnings beat estimates. International Business Machines Corp.
and  Intel Corp. (INTC) , which gained in anticipation of their results,
slumped at least 2.4 percent in extended trading.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.6 percent to
1,390.78 at 4 p.m. New York time, after falling 1.3 percent in
two days. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 194.13 points,
or 1.5 percent, to 13,115.54. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed
1.8 percent to 3,042.82. About  6 billion  shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, or 11 percent below the three-month average.  “The market was able to shrug off disappointing U.S.
economic reports,” said Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of
asset allocation for ING Investment Management. His firm
oversees $160 billion. “We’ve got data showing the German
economy is growing strong, positive earnings surprises in the
U.S. and some good news out of  Spain . There’s a lot of room for
positive surprises given how pessimistic things were.”  Stocks rallied as the IMF raised its 2012 global growth
estimate to 3.5 percent, German investor confidence rose and
Spanish bonds gained. Expectations that  Europe ’s crisis is
stabilizing overshadowed data showing that production at U.S.
factories dropped in March for the first time in four months and
builders broke ground on fewer houses than forecast.  Earnings Season  Today’s gain extended the 2012 rally for the S&P 500 to 11
percent as investors bought stocks amid better-than-estimated
economic and corporate data. While S&P 500 per-share profit
growth slowed to 1.7 percent during the first three months of
the year, it will accelerate to 8.6 percent during all of 2012,
according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  All  10 groups  in the  S&P 500  advanced as technology, energy
and industrial shares had the biggest gains. The Morgan Stanley
Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to economic growth added
1.4 percent as 28 of its 30 stocks gained.  “It’s a broad-based rally,” Mark Luschini, chief
investment strategist for Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC, which manages about $54 billion, said in a telephone
interview. “There’s maybe a bit of ‘risk-on’ trade.
Nonetheless, it seems like a healthy advance. Maybe what we’ve
seen is the end of the pullback in equities.”  Best Since 1998  Since reaching an almost  four-year high  on April 2, the S&P
500 slumped 3.5 percent through yesterday on concern about
global economic growth. The index is still down 1.3 percent in
April, after capping the best first-quarter rally since  1998. (SPX)   Apple rose 5.1 percent to $609.70, wiping out yesterday’s
drop, amid predictions that quarterly results due next week will
underscore buoyant demand for iPhones and iPads, the company’s
best-selling products.  The KBW Bank Index added 1.7 percent as all of its 24
stocks gained.  Bank of America  added 1.5 percent to $8.92.
Citigroup increased 3.2 percent to $35.08.  Coca-Cola gained 2.1 percent to $73.95. Chief Executive
Officer  Muhtar Kent  has introduced smaller package sizes to
attract price-conscious consumers as part of an effort to spur
sales in  North America .  Stocks also rose in anticipation of earnings at some of the
largest technology companies.  IBM (IBM) , which jumped 2.3 percent to
$207.45 in regular trading, tumbled 2.4 percent to $202.50 at
4:55 p.m. New York time. The biggest computer-services provider
reported  revenue (GS)  that missed projections.  Intel’s Results  Intel slumped 2.9 percent to $27.64 in extended trading,
after gaining for a second day ahead of its results. The world’s
largest semiconductor maker predicted higher second-quarter
sales than some analysts had estimated as it ships new personal-
computer and server chips and shortages of hard drives abate.  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  surged 10 percent to $22.96. The largest
thin-film panel maker will cut 30 percent of its workforce,
about 2,000 jobs, as demand in Europe slows faster than the
company can expand in  emerging markets  in Asia.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell 0.7 percent to $116.86. The
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets reported a 23 percent decline
in first-quarter profit. Revenue from trading bonds, currencies
and commodities lagged behind JPMorgan Chase & Co. The company
also boosted its dividend 31 percent.  No Harm  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)  slumped 4.3 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $68. The U.S. International Trade Commission said
pricing and subsidies for refrigerators made by LG Electronics
Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. didn’t harm the U.S. industry.  Allocations in U.S. stocks almost doubled in April on
renewed concern that the euro-area debt crisis will worsen,
prompting investors to sell European equities and hoard cash, a
Bank of America survey showed.  A net 27 percent of 191 respondents, who together manage
$554 billion, said they were overweight U.S. stocks, meaning
they hold more than is represented in benchmarks. That’s up from
14 percent last month. Expectations for an appreciation in the
dollar hit the third-highest level in more than 10 years.  The U.S. “is a default for investors,” said  Gary Baker ,
BofA’s head of European equity strategy, at a press briefing in
 London . “If you’re concerned about growth, and not sure how
concerned you should be, ultimately the U.S. is still your
safest haven.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
