Pacific Investment Management Co.
will open its first Latin American office in  Brazil  in September
as it seeks to expand its global presence.  The new office in Rio de Janeiro will be led by Alec Kersman, a senior vice president and head of Pimco’s Latin
America and Caribbean business, the Newport Beach, California-
based firm said today in a statement.  “The opening of this office in Brazil is an important and
exciting part of Pimco’s ongoing globalization and our evolution
as the complete provider of global investment solutions for a
growing number of clients around the world,” Mohamed El-Erian,
Pimco’s chief executive officer and co-chief investment officer
along with  Bill Gross , said in the statement.  Pimco, which has about $1.7 trillion in assets, is a unit
of insurer  Allianz SE. (ALV)  The firm, known for its bond funds run by
Gross, began expanding into other asset classes including stocks
more than two years ago. Pimco has said it will pursue
strategies with a global focus, in line with its “new normal”
philosophy that describes an era of lower returns, heightened
 government regulation , diminishing U.S. clout in the world
economy and a bigger role for developing nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
