Petroleos de Venezuela SA , the
state oil company, said net income surged 42.4 percent last year
to $4.5 billion as the average price for the country’s crude-oil
exports rose to a record high.  PDVSA, as the company is known, said that revenue rose 31.4
percent to $124.8 billion. PDVSA’s earnings before social
contributions to the central government and income tax more than
doubled to $35.2 billion, according to full year financial
results published today on the company’s website.  “This reinforces the fact that PDVSA is the most important
company in Venezuela,”  Rafael Ramirez , the company’s president
and oil minister, said today during an event at PDVSA’s
headquarters in Caracas. “Very few firms in  Latin America  have
such robust numbers, and we’re among the top companies in the
world in terms of revenue.”  Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  depends on oil for more
than 90 percent of export revenue and about 45 percent of
 government spending . PDVSA’s contributions to social programs
doubled to $11.6 billion while its transfers to an off-budget
development fund known as Fonden surged eightfold to $14.5
billion amid a change in the oil windfall tax to foreign  oil
companies  operating in the country.  PDVSA averaged production of 2.991 million barrels of oil a
day last year, a 0.5 percent increase from 2010, according to
the report. Exports rose 2.2 percent to 2.5 million barrels a
day, the company said.  Venezuela ’s  oil exports  averaged $100.50
a barrel last year, a 41 percent increase from 2010, according
to the Oil Ministry.  Rising Debt  PDVSA’s  total debt  surged 40 percent to $34.9 billion last
year after selling more than $10 billion in bonds, while debt
owed to service suppliers rose to $12.4 billion.  The company will continue to seek financing and take on new
debt as it looks to develop heavy crude  oil fields  in the
Orinoco Belt with minority partners, Ramirez said.  Venezuela will need $236 billion of investment through 2019
to boost production to 6 million barrels a day, of which $191
billion will be secured by PDVSA, Ramirez told state news agency
AVN today.  “No one develops something of this scale without taking on
debt,” Ramirez said. “PDVSA has healthy financial metrics.”  PDVSA signed a $1.5 billion crude oil supply contract with
Hutong Trading BV on Feb. 27 that will be paid off over three
years with quarterly shipments, according to the financial
report. The deal hadn’t been reported previously.  The yield on PDVSA’s 12.75 percent bonds due in 2022 fell
5 basis points, or 0.05 percentage points, to 13.40 percent
today at 4:45 p.m. in Caracas, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.24 cents to 96.47 cents on
the dollar.  Argentine Sovereignty  Venezuela supports  Argentina  in its move to expropriate
Repsol YPF SA’s stake from the country’s largest oil company as
a “sovereign” decision to force private companies into
reinvesting profits to boost output, Ramirez said.  Venezuela, which nationalized the oil industry in 2007,
forcing companies into minority partners in joint ventures, is
willing to help consult Argentina in the process, he said.  PDVSA has set aside $1.85 billion to confront pending
arbitration cases over investment disputes, up from $1 billion
in 2010, according to the report. PDVSA paid Exxon Mobil Corp. a
net $250.9 million in February for seized assets in 2007 and is
still awaiting a ruling on a case brought by ConocoPhillips.  The Venezuelan state’s stake in the oil industry is 94
percent, meaning that of every barrel sold, 94 percent of the
revenue goes to the government, Ramirez said.  “Our fiscal oil policies are criticized by private
companies for being strict, but they make a comfortable
profit,” Ramirez said today. “That’s why they remain in the
country working with us.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
