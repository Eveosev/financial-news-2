The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and share prices are as of the close in Buenos
Aires.  The  Merval (MERVAL)  index fell 3.3 percent to 2,378.52.  YPF SA (YPFD)   dropped 6.9 percent to 108 pesos, its
lowest price since May 2009. The Buenos Aires exchange lifted a
trading halt on the company’s stock that was implemented after
the government announced plans to nationalize the company.  Empresa Distribuidora & Comercializadora Norte SA (EDN)  ,
the country’s biggest power distributor, led losses among
members of the Merval benchmark index, falling 9.1 percent to
0.85 peso, its lowest price since May 2009. “The government’s
plan to nationalize YPF is increasing country risk for all
stocks and foreign funds are selling all kinds of stocks,”
Alberto Tarsia, a trader at Debursa Soc. de Bolsa, said in a
phone interview.  Tenaris SA (TEN)   rose 4.2 percent to 100.05 pesos, the
biggest gain in five weeks. The world’s largest producer of
seamless steel tubes used in the oil industry gained in line
with the price of crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
