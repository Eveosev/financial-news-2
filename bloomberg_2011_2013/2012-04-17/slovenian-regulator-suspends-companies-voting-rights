Slovenia’s market regulator
suspended the voting rights of stakeholders in  Krka Group d.d. ,
which include  Luka Koper (LKPG)  d.d. and  Zavarovalnica Triglav (ZVTG)  d.d.,
until they announce a takeover bid for the drugmaker or dispose
of their stock.  The state-owned companies Slovenska Odskodninska Druzba
d.d., Kapitalska Druzba d.d., a unit of  Nova Kreditna Banka
Maribor (KBMR)  d.d.,  Aerodrom Ljubljana (AELG)  d.d., Luka Koper and Triglav,
an insurer, own about 27.5 percent of Krka. They are “are
acting in concert to achieve and exceed the takeover
threshold,” the Novo mesto-based drug maker said in a
regulatory statement today after receiving a note from the
Securities Market Agency in Ljubljana.  According to Slovenia’s legislation, a company or a group
of companies acting together must make a takeover bid if it owns
more than 25 percent of a target firm. The legislation is set to
be amended by lawmakers to lift the threshold to 33 percent,
Damjan Zugelj, the director of the securities agency, said in a
phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
