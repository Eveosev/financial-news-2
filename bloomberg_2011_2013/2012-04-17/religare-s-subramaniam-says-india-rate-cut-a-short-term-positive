Akhil Jindal, director for group
corporate affairs at Welspun Corp., comments after  India ’s
central bank reduced interest rates for the first time since
2009. Jindal spoke in a phone interview today.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, advanced 0.4
percent to 17,213.80 at 12:15 p.m. in Mumbai, poised for its
highest close since April 12.  On liquidity:  “There was a big liquidity crunch in the money markets and
this should help ease it.”  “I expect financing costs will now go down by at least 50
bps, if not more. For a group like us which has 100 billion
rupee plus borrowings, it’s 500 million rupees less a year.”  The  Reserve Bank  of India lowered the repurchase rate to 8
percent from 8.50 percent and highlighted inflation risks that
limit the scope for future rate cuts. The outcome was predicted
by three of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Seventeen
expected a 0.25 percentage-point cut.  On new investments:  “The rate cut will boost investments in projects by
companies and expansion in manufacturing especially because new
investments are very  interest rate  sensitive.  ‘‘In the last three years, financing costs for
manufacturing based companies like us has spiraled, from about 9
percent in 2009 to over 12 percent now.  ‘‘The government has now signaled an easing off on interest
costs. This will give a boost to the industry,’’ he said.  On GDP growth:  ‘‘It will boost GDP growth. The RBI target on growth was
quite welcome. It means there could be more rate cuts going
forward, possibly in the October policy.’’  Welspun Corp. (WLCO) , based in Mumbai, is the Welspun Group’s
flagship company and makes pipes used by global oil and gas
companies. Its shares rose 0.3 percent to 133.60 rupees at 12:15
p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
