Kenya ’s shilling was unchanged
against the dollar, snapping two days of gains, after the
central bank received bids for fewer  repurchase agreements  than
it had offered.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy traded as
much as 0.3 percent lower at 83.30 per dollar and traded at
yesterday’s closing price of 83.05 by 2:48 p.m. in Nairobi.  Kenya’s central bank received bids for 550 million
shillings ($6.62 million) of seven-day repurchase agreements,
which it sold at 17.545 percent, an official at the Nairobi-
based bank said in a phone interview today. The bank had offered
2 billion shillings of the securities, the official said.  Uganda’s currency declined as much as 0.7 percent and was
0.4 percent weaker at 2,509.50 per dollar.  “The shilling also came under pressure because of dollar
purchases in the  interbank market ,” Taib Lubega, a currency
trader at Stanbic Bank Uganda Ltd. said by phone from Kampala.  Tanzania’s shilling depreciated as much as 0.2 percent, and
was trading 0.1 percent weaker at 1,588 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Demand from the construction sector has caused the
shilling to depreciate,” Hakim Sheik, a dealer with Commercial
Bank of Africa Tanzania Ltd., said today by phone from  Dar es
Salaam , the commercial capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
