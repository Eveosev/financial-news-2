Swiss economic growth will
accelerate in 2013 as global demand strengthens, the
 International Monetary Fund  said.  Gross domestic product may increase by 0.8 percent this
year and 1.7 percent in 2013, the Washington-based lender said
in its World Economic Outlook published today. In September, the
IMF forecast 2012 growth of 1.4 percent.  Switzerland ’s export-led economy is expected to expand as
low unemployment is bolstering private spending and exports are
defying flagging global demand as well as the franc’s strength.
Swiss central bank governing board member Jean-Pierre Danthine
last month said “there are growing indications that the Swiss
economy is stabilizing.”  The Swiss government last month said the country’s economy
will grow 0.8 percent this year before expanding 1.8 percent in
2013. Exports will climb 1.3 percent this year and 4.5 percent
next, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
