Volkswagen AG (VOW)  is set to approve
building an Audi factory in Mexico to bolster the brand’s
pursuit of  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , a person familiar with
the situation said.  Volkswagen’s supervisory board will vote tomorrow on plans
for the plant, which will supply Audi vehicles to the U.S. and
Latin American markets, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the meetings are private.  Audi, which sells about half as many cars in the U.S. as
BMW and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz, is looking to catch up with
its German rivals in North America. The brand seeks to increase
sales in the U.S. to 200,000 by 2018 from 117,600 last year.  The decision would come about a year after Volkswagen
opened a factory in  Tennessee , the group’s only U.S. plant, to
shore up efforts to overtake  General Motors Co. (GM)  as the world’s
biggest carmaker. BMW produces vehicles in South Carolina, while
Mercedes assembles cars in Alabama.  Walter Hanek, corporate director of Audi’s Mexican unit,
said Volkswagen wants a new North American plant, without
specifying in which country.  “The way Audi is growing right now, there will be a need
for this new production,’’ Hanek said today in an interview on
the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on  Latin America  in
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.  Hanek declined to provide additional comment on the
potential plant, saying the matter was in the Volkswagen
supervisory board’s hands.  “ Mexico  is doing a great job at producing and exporting
vehicles,’’ Hanek said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
