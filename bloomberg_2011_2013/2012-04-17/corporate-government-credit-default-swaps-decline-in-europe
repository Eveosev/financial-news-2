The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate and sovereign debt fell, according
to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings
fell 10.5 basis points to 669.5 at 10:20 a.m. in London. The
Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings dropped two basis points to 142 basis points. A
decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell one basis point to 249 and the
subordinated index dropped one to 406.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments declined three basis points to
2279.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
