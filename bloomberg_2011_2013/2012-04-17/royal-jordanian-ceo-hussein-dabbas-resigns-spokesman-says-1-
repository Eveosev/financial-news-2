Royal Jordanian Airlines (RJAL)  said Chief
Executive Officer Hussein Dabbas resigned to take another job,
less than three years after he was appointed to run the carrier.  Dabbas “decided to resign because he believes it is time
for a change in the company and it is time for new ideas to
develop the company,” Basel Kilani, a spokesman at the Amman-
based airline, said by phone. Dabbas will leave his post in June
to take the new job, he said, without elaborating.  Dabbas said on April 1 that it was “a must” for state-
controlled Royal Jordanian, a member of the British Airways-led
Oneworld airline alliance, to merge with a larger carrier as
high fuel prices, competition from local rivals and a sluggish
economy squeeze earnings. Royal Jordanian, founded in 1963 and
one of the  Middle East ’s oldest airlines, reported a loss of
57.9 million dinars ($82 million) in 2011.  The airline, which scrapped more than 1,300 flights last
year as political unrest in the Middle East and the European
sovereign-debt crisis hurt demand, has abandoned four routes
this year and cut the number of flights on others.  Dabbas has been chief executive officer of Royal Jordanian
Airlines since August 2009, according to the company’s  website .
He first joined the airline in 1979.  To contact the reporters on this story:
