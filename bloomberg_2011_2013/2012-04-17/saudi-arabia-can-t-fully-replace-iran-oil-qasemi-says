Saudi Arabia , which increased crude
output in recent months, can’t replace Iranian exports in the
long-term, Iran’s oil minister told  Press TV .  “This is not possible and even if it was possible, it
would be on a temporary basis and it will have negative effects
in future,” Rostam Qasemi said yesterday in an interview on the
state-run channel that was published on its website today.  The world’s biggest crude exporter increased oil production
to near the highest in three decades as the U.S. and European
Union impose sanctions against purchases of Iranian oil in an
attempt to halt the Islamic republic’s nuclear program. The
kingdom is not happy with current prices and will use its spare
capacity to meet any additional required volumes, Saudi Oil
Minister Ali al-Naimi said April 13.  Saudi Arabia told  Iran  at the last meeting of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that it wouldn’t
replace Iranian crude in the world market, yet the kingdom’s new
policy shows the contrary given that Saudi Arabia has said it’s
ready to replace Iran’s oil, Press TV cited Qasemi as saying.  Iran’s crude production and exports haven’t fallen amid
embargoes from  Europe  and the U.S., he said. The sanctions have
created tension in the world market, causing prices to rise and
hurting Europe’s economy, Qasemi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
