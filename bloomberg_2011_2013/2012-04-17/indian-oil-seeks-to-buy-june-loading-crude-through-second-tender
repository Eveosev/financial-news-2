Indian Oil Corp., the nationâ€™s
largest refiner, issued its second tender to buy crude for
loading in June, according to a document obtained by Bloomberg
News.  The tender closes on April 18 at 3 p.m. local time and
offers are valid until the following day at 5 p.m., according to
the document.  The company bought 6 million barrels of Nigerian crude for
loading in May via two tenders last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
