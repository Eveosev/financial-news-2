(Corrects headline and first paragraph to clarify
Ghizzoni’s comments on hypothetical debt crisis.)  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  Chief Executive
Officer  Federico Ghizzoni  said Italy “has room” to raise
household taxes in case of an emergency crisis in order to pay
off its public debt,  Hospodarske Noviny  reported, citing an
interview with Ghizzoni.  Italy’s public debt represents only 23 percent of the value
of household wealth, so the country can afford to pay it off
without a rescue package from the European Union, the newspaper
said, citing Ghizzoni.  To contact the reporter on this story:
