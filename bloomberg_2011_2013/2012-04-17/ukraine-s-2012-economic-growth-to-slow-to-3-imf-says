Ukraine’s economic growth will slow
this year because demand for the former Soviet nation’s exports
is “waning,” the  International Monetary Fund  said.  Gross domestic product will probably advance 3 percent in
2012, less than the government’s 3.7 percent forecast and last
year’s 5.2 percent growth, the Washington-based lender predicted
today in its  World Economic Outlook  report. Inflation may
average 4.5 percent, compared with 8 percent last year, it said.  Ukraine’s economy is losing momentum as the euro area’s
debt crisis trims demand for exports such as metals, which
generate more than 50 percent of GDP. The economy grew 4.7
percent from a year earlier in the fourth quarter, compared with
6.5 percent in the previous three months, official data show.  Should Europe’s debt crisis escalate, Ukraine’s currency
will come under pressure while the government may struggle to
raise funding as capital outflows create large external
financing needs, the IMF said. The current-account deficit will
widen to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2012 from 5.6 percent last year
before narrowing to 5.2 percent in 2013, it added.  The IMF sees GDP growing 3.5 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporters on this story:
