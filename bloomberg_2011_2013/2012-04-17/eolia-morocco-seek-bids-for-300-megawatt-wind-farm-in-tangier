Theolia SA (TEO) , a French power company,
and Morocco’s state-owned utility Office National de
l’Electricite invited bids to build the first phase of a 300-
megawatt wind farm in the Tangier area.  Theolia, based in Aix-en-Provence, and the Moroccan
electricity company started a call for bids to choose suppliers
and contractors to build the first stage in Tetouan, which will
boost installed capacity at the Koudia al Baida wind farm from
50 megawatts to 100 megawatts, Theolia said in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
