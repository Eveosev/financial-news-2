The  Bank of England  can loosen
policy further to boost an economy that will struggle to grow
this year, the  International Monetary Fund  said.  British economic growth “will be weak in early 2012,
before recovering,” the Washington-based IMF said in its World
Economic Outlook today. “With inflation expected to fall below
the 2 percent target amid weaker growth and commodity prices,
the Bank of England can further ease its monetary policy
stance.”  The U.K. central bank maintained the size of its bond-
purchase  program  at 325 billion pounds ($517 billion) this month
and has predicted that the inflation rate will drop below its
goal this year. Still, divisions among policy makers have
emerged as a jump in energy costs threatens to underpin prices
and data show services and manufacturing picking up after the
economy contracted 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter.  U.K.  gross domestic product  will increase 0.8 percent this
year, the IMF said today, raising a previous projection for 0.6
growth published in January. It maintained a forecast for 2
percent expansion in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
