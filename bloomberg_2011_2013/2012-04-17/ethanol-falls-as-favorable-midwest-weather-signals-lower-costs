Ethanol futures declined in  Chicago 
on speculation favorable weather in the corn-rich U.S. Midwest
will boost crops and lower production costs.  Prices fell as the U.S. Agriculture Department said
unusually warm March weather and April rains improved soil
conditions. About 17 percent of the corn crop was planted as of
April 15, up from 7 percent a week before and 5 percent a year
ago, the USDA said. Corn is used to make ethanol in the U.S.  “There’s good planting weather,” said Matt Janney, a
trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “Things
kind of sold off late.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery declined 4.1 cents, or
1.9 percent, to settle at $2.156 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the biggest one-day drop and the lowest price since
March 29. Futures have fallen 2.1 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast plunged 4
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.29 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive sank 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.225, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.17 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel slipped 0.5 cent to
$2.25.  Corn for May delivery tumbled 6.5 cents, or 1 percent, to
$6.1675 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
