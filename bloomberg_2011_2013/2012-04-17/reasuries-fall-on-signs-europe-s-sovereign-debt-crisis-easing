Treasuries fell for the first time
in three days after  Spain  raised more than its maximum target at
a bill auction and a German report showed investor confidence
unexpectedly increased, damping demand for the safest assets.  Ten-year note yields climbed from the lowest level in six
weeks after Spain sold 3.18 billion euros ($4.18 billion) of 12-
and 18-month bills, compared with the target of 3 billion euros
the nation’s Treasury set for the auction. The ZEW Center for
European Economic Research in Mannheim said its index of German
investor and analyst expectations climbed to the highest level
since June 2010.  The  yield  on the 10-year note climbed one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 2 percent at 10:25 a.m. in  London ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
security due in February 2022 dropped 3/32, or 94 cents per
$1,000 face amount, to 100 1/32. The yield dropped to 1.94
percent yesterday, the least since March 6.  U.S. home starts rose to a 705,000 annual rate in March
following a 698,000 pace the prior month, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce Department data today.
Existing-home sales increased 0.7 percent last month, a separate
survey showed ahead of the April 19 report by the National
Association of Realtors.  Industrial production gained 0.3 percent in March after
being little changed in February, economists said before the
 Federal Reserve  releases the figure today.  “The  U.S. economy  keeps recovering modestly,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee the equivalent of $22 billion as
chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management in Tokyo. “Yields
at current levels are too low.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
