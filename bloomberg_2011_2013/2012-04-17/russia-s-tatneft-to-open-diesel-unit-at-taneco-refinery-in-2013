OAO  Tatneft (TATN) , the builder of
Russia’s only refinery since the collapse of the  Soviet Union ,
plans to open a diesel-making unit at the plant next year.  The hydrocracker at the Taneco facility will start
operating in the second quarter of 2013, according to Vasily
Mozgovoy, an assistant to the general director.  The company expects to invest as much as $1 billion this
year in the refinery, Mozgovoy said on a conference call with
investors. Taneco started operating in 2011.  Taneco will have a capacity of 7 million metric tons a
year, or 141,000 barrels a day, when fully operational and
currently produces mostly fuel oil, Mozgovoy said. Hydrocrackers
produce distillate fuels, a category that includes diesel and
heating oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
