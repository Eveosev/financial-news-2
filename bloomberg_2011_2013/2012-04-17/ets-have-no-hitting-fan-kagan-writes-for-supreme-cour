U.S.  Supreme Court  Justice Elena Kagan, described as a “die-hard” New York Mets baseball fan by
President Barack Obama when he nominated her in 2010, doesn’t
sound impressed with her favorite team’s performance at the
plate.  In an opinion today interpreting a federal drug-approval
law, Kagan slipped in a mention of the Mets while discussing how
the word “a” can sometimes mean “any.”  “If your child admits that she ‘did not read a book all
summer,’ you will surmise that she did not read any book (but
went to the movies a lot),” Kagan wrote. “And if a sports-fan
friend bemoans that ‘the New York Mets do not have a chance of
winning the  World Series ,’ you will gather that the team has no
chance whatsoever (because they have no hitting).”  The ruling was unanimous.  The Mets, 7-3 after yesterday’s game, are hitting .248,
seventh in the 16-team National League, and are tied for 12th
with 3.6 runs per game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
