Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said it’s
speeding up work on a project to capture  natural gas  from
oilfields in southern Iraq and that it has signed an initial
agreement to develop a petrochemical plant based on ethane.  “All hands on deck to catch up with time lost” after more
than a year of negotiations to sign the $17 billion gas-capture
agreement ended in November, Mounir Bouaziz, Shell’s Middle East
vice president for new business, said today at a conference in
Istanbul.  Iraq is now flaring gas produced in association with crude
oil because it lacks the infrastructure to use it as fuel for
electricity plants or feedstock for the petrochemical industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
