Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  Taiwan trading . Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close in Taipei.  The benchmark Taiex Index fell 1.9 percent to 7,585.87, the
biggest decline since March 29.  Apple Inc.-related companies:  Largan Precision Co. (3008)  (3008
TT), a lens maker, dropped 3.7 percent to NT$549.  Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co. (2317)  (2317 TT), assembler for Apple products,
declined 3.9 percent to NT$110. Apple slumped 4.2 percent
yesterday amid speculation that demand for the iPad may wane and
that mobile-phone carriers will cut subsidies for the iPhone,
eroding the profitability of the company’s best-selling
products.  Evergreen Marine Corp. (2603)  (2603 TT), the listed arm of
Taiwan’s biggest container-shipping group, plunged 5.6 percent
to NT$16.75 after announcing a preliminary accord to lease 10
mega-vessels. The ships may worsen a capacity glut that has
pushed rates to unprofitable levels, said Parker Wu, who
oversees the equivalent of $100 million of assets for
Agriculture Bank of Taiwan in Taipei.  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT) retreated 6.2 percent to NT$485, the
lowest since Jan. 13.  Asia ’s second-largest smartphone maker
named Chang Chia-lin, a former partner at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., as its new chief financial officer and spokesman 10 days
after reporting its biggest drop in profit since listing a
decade ago.  “Investors are concerned about how the appointment
may reflect instability of HTC’s management,” said Jeff Pu, who
rates the stock add at Fubon Financial Holding Co. in Taipei.  To contact the reporter on this story:
