Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d.,
 Slovenia ’s second-biggest lender by assets, said its first loss
since a 2007 share sale was larger than previously estimated as
bad loan provisions soared.  The bank’s net loss last year was 81 million euros ($106
million) compared with a March 1 estimate of 53.6 million euros,
the Maribor-based bank said in an e-mailed statement today.
Provisions for bad loans surged to 175.4 million euros, or 21
percent more than the earlier estimate.  Nova Kreditna and its larger rival Nova Ljubljanska Banka
d.d. were forced to put aside record reserves for bad loans
after the  construction industry  plunged following the 2009
recession. Lenders in Slovenia, which rely on European Central
Bank liquidity, will probably incur further losses this year as
the  economy  enters another recession, the jobless rate rises and
the government embarks on austerity measures, the central bank
said last month.  Banks in Slovenia need to raise capital and clean their
balance sheets after the country’s financial system was
“strongly” hit by the financial crisis, the  International
Monetary Fund  said in a report yesterday. Slovenia’s export-
driven economy will probably shrink 1 percent this year, the IMF
said today, after contracting 0.2 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
