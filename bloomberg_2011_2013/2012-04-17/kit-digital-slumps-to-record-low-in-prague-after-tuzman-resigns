Kit Digital Inc. (KITD) , a maker of online
video software, reversed an earlier drop to a record low in
Prague trading to head for the highest price in three weeks.  The stock advanced 6.2 percent to 143.33 koruna as of 4:19
p.m. in Prague, set for the strongest close since March 22. Kit
earlier tumbled as much as 19 percent to 110 koruna, the lowest
intraday price since cross-listing its New York-traded shares on
the Czech bourse in January 2010, after the company said Kaleil Isaza Tuzman, its non-executive chairman, resigned.  Kitâ€™s U.S.-traded shares jumped 7.4 percent to $7.57 by
10:20 a.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
