The  Orlando Magic  sent Philadelphia
to its sixth loss in eight games, dropping the 76ers behind the
 New York Knicks  for the final playoff spot in the National
Basketball Association’s Eastern Conference.  Ryan Anderson had 26 points and 16 rebounds last night as
the Magic won 113-100 in Orlando, Florida.  J.J. Redick added 18 points for Orlando (36-25), which was
without All-Star center Dwight Howard for the fifth straight
game because of a herniated disc in his back. The Magic, who
hold the sixth playoff spot in the East, have a 3-4 record this
season without Howard, who is out indefinitely.  The 76ers fell to 31-29, tied with New York for the
seventh-best record in the East. The Knicks hold the tiebreaker
advantage by winning two of three meetings between the teams
this season. The top eight teams in each conference make the NBA
playoffs.  Philadelphia has six regular-season games remaining,
including at home today against the  Indiana Pacers  before a
season-ending five-game road trip. The Pacers (39-22) are in
third place in the East after last night’s 111-88 rout of the
Minnesota Timberwolves.  The Knicks also have six games left and are home tonight
against the Boston Celtics (36-25), who are in fourth place in
the Eastern Conference. New York will play four of its final
five regular-season games on the road.  The Atlanta Hawks clinched a playoff berth yesterday with a
109-87 win against the Toronto Raptors. The Hawks improved to
36-25 -- the same record as the Magic and Celtics -- and play
their final five regular-season games at home.  The  Phoenix Suns  beat the Portland Trail Blazers 125-107 to
move into the eighth and final playoff spot in the Western
Conference. The Suns climbed past the  Houston Rockets , who lost
their fourth straight game, 105-102 to the  Denver Nuggets .
Phoenix and Houston are tied with 32-29 records, a half-game
ahead of the Utah Jazz (32-20). The Suns hold a tiebreaker
advantage with a better record against conference opponents.  The Nuggets (34-27) jumped into the sixth playoff spot in
the West, a half-game ahead of the Dallas Mavericks (34-28), who
lost to the Jazz 123-121 in triple overtime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
