The  European Commission  suspended a
plan by the Estonian Competition Authority to impose mobile
termination rates that the commission considers excessive.  Termination rates are the charges mobile operators demand
from other providers for delivering voice calls.  The Estonian authority’s proposed pricing doesn’t “fully
follow” EU telecommunications rules and would harm consumers,
the commission said in an e-mailed statement late yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
