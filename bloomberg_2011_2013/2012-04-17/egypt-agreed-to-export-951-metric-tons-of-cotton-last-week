Egypt  agreed to export 951 metric
tons of cotton in the week ending April 12, the Alexandria
Cotton Exporters Association said today in its weekly bulletin.  The country has shipped 67,940 tons of cotton valued at
$213.7 million since the marketing year began on Sept. 1. Of
last week’s sales, Egypt will ship 569 tons of the Giza 88
cotton variety and 382 tons of Giza 86, the association said.  Egypt produces the world’s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-end clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India  are
the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
