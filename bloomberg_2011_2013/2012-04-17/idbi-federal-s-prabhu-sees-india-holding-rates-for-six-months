Sri Prasad Prabhu, head of fixed-
income at IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co., comments on  India ’s
 interest rates . The  Reserve Bank  of India today reduced the
 repurchase rate  to 8 percent from 8.5 percent, an outcome
predicted by only three of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. Prabhu spoke in a telephone interview from Mumbai.  “The concerns on growth were higher, which is why there is
a larger cut in interest rates. This will address those concerns
in one shot.  ‘‘The borrowing plan this year is abnormally large and so,
as a sop to the market, the rates may have been cut by a larger
proportion than expected.  ‘‘Inflation concerns are persistent, which have been
highlighted in the policy. We will be looking at an 8 percent
repurchase rate for a sustained period of time, maybe up to six
months.  Oil prices  and the fiscal situation remain a risk, which
is why the central bank will pause on rates.  ‘‘The 10-year bond yield may rise to as much as 8.75
percent in the next six months because of the high government
borrowing plan.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
