Norway ’s central bank Governor
Oeystein Olsen said policy makers have never discussed placing a
Swiss-style cap on the krone amid speculation the bank may
resort to such measures should the currency continue its ascent.  “We are very far from the Swiss situation and we have
other measures,” Olsen said in an interview in Oslo today.  The governor has warned traders to be prepared for krone
losses after cutting the benchmark rate 0.75 percentage point to
1.5 percent since December in an effort to check currency gains
that kept inflation below the bank’s 2.5 percent target. While
the measures were initially effective, the currency has returned
to its appreciation trajectory, rising 1.3 percent versus the
euro since March 28.  HSBC Holdings Plc,  Europe ’s largest bank, said this month
the central bank may need to resort to a Swiss-style cap on the
krone to stem gains. The Nordic currency has strengthened almost
4 percent since September, the month the  Swiss National Bank 
pegged the franc to the euro to halt its rally.  The krone strengthened less than 0.1 percent versus the
euro to 7.5454 as of 2:35 p.m. in Oslo. The currency was little
changed at 5.7450 per dollar.  Norway, the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter, has been
attracting investors amid concern Europe will fail to contain
its debt crisis. The government has no net debt and the biggest
budget surplus of any AAA rated nation, thanks to a $600 billion
sovereign-wealth fund. Unemployment fell to 2.6 percent in
March, Europe’s lowest rate. Norway, like  Switzerland , isn’t a
member of the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
