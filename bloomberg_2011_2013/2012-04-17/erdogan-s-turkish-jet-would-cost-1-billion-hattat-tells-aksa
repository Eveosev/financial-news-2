Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s desire to build a domestic plane would cost more than
$1 billion, Hattat Holding Chairman Mehmet Hattat told Aksam.  Hattat can partner with foreign companies to get know-how
within two years and meet the “difficult yet not impossible”
target of building a Turkish aircraft, the holding company’s
chairman, who oversees 17 firms in the energy, automotive,
tourism and construction industries, told the Istanbul-based
newspaper.  Erdogan told Hattat April 15 that he wants a locally
produced commercial aircraft, while Defense Minister Ismet Yilmaz said efforts to build a Turkish warplane continue
“uninterrupted,” Aksam reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
