Investors owning the most senior
notes in  Europe ’s first commercial mortgage-backed securities to
default on maturity rejected a “consensual restructuring” of
the 601.7 million euros ($792 million) of debt.  Opera Finance (Uni-Invest) BV Class A noteholders didn’t
approve a plan to extend the  bonds  to 2016, adjust interest
payments and hire Valad Europe to sell the real estate backing
the CMBS, according to a notice sent today by Eurohypo AG, the
special servicer. The vote was held at a meeting in Amsterdam.  The decision clears the way for them to accept an offer for
their Class A notes from TPG Capital and Patron Capital Partners
to recover 358.8 million euros that they’re owed. They are
scheduled to vote on this proposal at 2 p.m. Amsterdam time.  Under the buyout firms’ offer, Class A noteholders would
receive an initial payment of 40 percent, about 144 million
euros, plus interest and some expenses. The balance will be in
the form of new four-year notes to be repaid with asset-sale
proceeds. The three junior CMBS tranches wouldn’t get repaid the
242.9 million euros that they’re owed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
