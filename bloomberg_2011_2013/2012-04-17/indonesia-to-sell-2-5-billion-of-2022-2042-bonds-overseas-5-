Indonesia  is planning to sell $2.5
billion of bonds overseas, tapping global investors to spur
economic growth for the second time this year after winning an
investment-grade rating.  The Southeast Asian country is offering $2 billion of 10-
year bonds to yield 3.85 percent, according to a person familiar
with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the
details are private. The country is also issuing $500 million
more of its existing 5.25 percent bonds due 2042, the person
said. The additional notes are being offered at a yield of 4.95
percent, according to the person.  Indonesia is taking advantage of relative borrowing costs
close to an eight-month low as the government plans to spend $53
billion until 2020 to build railways, airports and seaports.
Emerging-market debt sales reached $326 billion this year,
showing demand for those bonds even as  Europe ’s debt crisis
worsened.  “This is a rare issuance with relatively low risk,” said
Teddy Satriadi, the Jakarta-based head of fixed income desk at
PT Bank Negara Indonesia. “News of the investment grade award
is still in investors’ minds and there is demand in the market
for dollar-denominated issuance, whether it is corporate or
government.”  Rating Upgrades  Indonesia’s 10-year bond offering at 4.05 percent will give
investors a spread of 204 basis points over  U.S. debt , according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the 4.36
percent yield on Russia’s 4.5 percent dollar notes due April
2022, 231 basis points more than Treasuries.  Fitch Ratings  raised Indonesia’s ranking by one level to
BBB- in December, followed by Moody’s Investors Service to Baa3
in January. Both are the lowest investment grades.  Russia  is
rated two levels higher at Moody’s.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Indonesia’s
dollar-denominated securities rather than similar-maturity
Treasuries narrowed 46 basis points this year to 228 points,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global  index . The
spread reached 188 points on March 19, the lowest level since
Aug. 5, 2011. The average yield premium for developing nations’
debt was 363 basis points yesterday, down 64 points this year,
according to JPMorgan  indexes .  ‘Quite an Achievement’  Indonesia’s dollar debt returned 14 percent in the past
year, the second-best performance in  Asia  after the 17 percent
gain on the notes of the  Philippines , indexes compiled by HSBC
Holdings Plc show.  Five-year credit-default swap contracts on Indonesia’s debt
dropped 37 basis points this year to 171 as of April 16,
according to data provider CMA, which compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market. The contracts insure
debt against non-payment and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality .  The Southeast Asian country raised $1.75 billion from the
sale of the 30-year bonds in January, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The bonds yielded 4.881 percent yesterday, before the new
deal was announced, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc prices on Bloomberg.  Manulife Asset Management, which has Asian bond holdings of
about $34 billion, favors holding Indonesia’s rupiah securities
instead of its dollar debt because of the risk that U.S. yields
may rise.  “We definitely like Indonesia,” said Neal Capecci, a
portfolio manager in Hong Kong at Manulife Asset. “We think
Indonesia should be on a path of sovereign upgrades. We prefer
to buy the local sovereigns.”  Economic Growth  Rupiah 10-year bonds yield 6.08 percent, 407 basis points
more than similar-maturity U.S. bonds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The U.S. 10-year yield has risen 13 basis
points this year to 2.01 percent after dropping 142 basis points
in 2011.  Rahmat Waluyanto, director general at the finance
ministry’s debt management office, didn’t immediately reply to a
mobile-phone text message seeking comment. Bhimantara Widyajala,
a director at the debt office, declined to comment when asked by
mobile-phone text message about sale plans.  Economic growth may reach 6.3 percent to 6.7 percent this
year and accelerate to as much as 6.8 percent in 2013, the
central bank said on April 12.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Standard Chartered Plc are
managing the offers, according to a person familiar with the
sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
