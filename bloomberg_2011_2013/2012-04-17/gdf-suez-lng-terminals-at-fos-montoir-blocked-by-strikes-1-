Workers at  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA’s three
French terminals for importing liquified natural gas are
blocking operations because of a dispute over salaries,
according to a statement from the CGT union.  Work has been halted at Fos Tonkin and Fos Cavaou near
Marseille and a vessel expected to arrive at Montoir-de-Bretagne
won’t be unloaded, the union said today.  “There is total exasperation,” the CGT said in the
statement. The union is demanding an increase in salaries to
reflect higher 2011 profit at GDF Suez’s Elengy unit and 2.5
percent greater volume in LNG imports at the sites last year.  GDF Suez spokesman Jerome Chambin confirmed work at the
three terminals is halted and vessels won’t be unloaded.  To contact the reporter on this story:
