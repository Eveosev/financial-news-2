Gold sales from  Australia ’s Perth
Mint, which processes all of the country’s bullion, declined 9.6
percent last month as signs of an accelerating economic recovery
in the U.S. curbed demand for haven investments.  Sales of gold coins and bars dropped to 38,123 ounces from
42,161 ounces a year earlier, according to data e-mailed by the
mint after an April 13 interview with Neil Vance, wholesale
manager at the facility in  Western Australia  that was founded in
1899. Silver sales slumped 39 percent to 698,559 ounces, it said.  Bullion prices dropped in February and March as U.S. non-
farm payrolls expanded, boosting signs that the world’s largest
economy is recovering even as European countries including  Spain 
tackle the region’s debt crisis. Sales from the mint may rebound
later this year following a pattern seen in 2011, Vance said.  “What’s happened is a little bit more stability in world
markets at the moment, and some of the interest has leveled
off,” Vance said by phone from Perth. “Since the global
financial crisis hit, we’ve experienced peaks and troughs, and
we believe at the moment we’re just in a trough.”  Immediate-delivery gold, which dropped 2.4 percent in
February and a further 1.7 percent in March, traded at $1,653.05
an ounce at 4:51 p.m. in  Singapore . Spot silver was at $31.58 an
ounce after declining 7 percent last month.  ‘Bit More Gloomy’  “We’re getting to an area where it’s probably smart to get
back into the market,” Nick Trevethan, senior commodities
strategist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., said
by phone today. “The decision to buy is highly dependent on
news headlines. We’ve seen in the last day or so, headlines
about  Europe  turning a little bit more gloomy.”  Spain sold 3.18 billion euros ($4.18 billion) of bills
today after borrowing costs climbed to near levels that prompted
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek bailouts. The average 12-
month yield was 2.623 percent in the sale, compared with 1.418
percent at the last auction on March 20, while 18-month bills
yielded 3.11 percent, compared with 1.711 percent last month,
the Bank of Spain said. The region’s crisis is getting worse,
Pacific Investment Management Co. said on April 11.  In the first quarter, gold and silver coin and bar sales
from the Perth Mint totaled 2.16 million ounces compared with
almost 3.7 million a year earlier, according to mint data.
Investors can buy and store gold at the mint, or buy coins to
hold themselves. The figures refer to coins, as well as so-
called investment and minted bars, according to the mint.  U.S. Mint  Sales of gold coins from the  U.S. Mint  were 62,500 ounces
in March, 15 percent lower than a year earlier, according to the
Washington, D.C.-based mint’s  website . So far in April, they’ve
totaled 12,500 ounces, and at that pace would be 25,000 ounces
this month, 76.9 percent lower than a year earlier.  The U.S. grew “at a modest to moderate pace” from mid-
February through late March as manufacturing, hiring and retail
sales showed signs of strength, the  Federal Reserve  said in a
report on April 11. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President
 James Bullard  said yesterday that the economy is “on track.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said on March 28 gold will rise
further on another round of stimulus from the Fed, which has
pledged to hold rates at a record low through 2014 to sustain
the recovery. While the metal may drop this quarter, the price
may recover in the second half, UBS AG said the same day.  Gold may reach $1,830 in the third quarter and $1,900 in
the fourth, according to the median estimate of 19 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. The metal, which has rallied for 11 years,
reached a record $1,921.15 on Sept. 6 last year.  Holdings in bullion-backed exchange-traded products stood
at 2,395.126 metric tons yesterday, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That compares to the all-time high of 2,410.186
tons on March 13.  “People believe they see the peak in the price, so they
sell back their coins or wait for it to come back in price
before coming in to buy again,” Vance said. “Certainly we
expect that to happen this year.”  To contact the reporter for this story:
