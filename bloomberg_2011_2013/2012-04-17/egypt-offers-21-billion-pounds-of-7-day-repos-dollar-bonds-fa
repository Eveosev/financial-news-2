Egypt  will offer seven-day
 repurchase agreements  today valued at 21 billion Egyptian pounds
($3.5 billion), after accepting bids for 15.7 billion pounds
last week. The dollar bonds retreated for a second day.  The contracts allow government security holders to sell
them back to the North African country’s central bank to access
funds for a week at 9.75 percent, according to the regulator’s
data on Bloomberg. The facility was started in March 2011 to
ease pressure on funding at local banks as they increased
holdings of government debt amid political unrest.  Yields on Egyptian domestic debt have receded from record
highs after the central bank lowered the local-currency reserve
requirement for banks, making more cash available for investment
in government debt. The  finance ministry  sold  one-year treasury
bills  last week at an average yield of 15.577 percent, down from
15.975 percent on Feb. 9, the highest level since Bloomberg
started tracking the data in 2006.  The yield on the country’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 rose two basis points, or 0.02 of a percentage point, to
6.91 percent at 11:18 a.m. in Cairo, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The Egyptian pound weakened less than 0.1
percent to 6.0398 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
