Russian  producer-price  growth
accelerated more than economists forecast last month.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines grew 7.4
percent from a year earlier after a 7 percent advance in
February, the Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in
an e-mailed statement. The median  estimate  of eight economists
in a Bloomberg survey was for a 6.8 percent increase.  Factory-gate prices rose 2.1 percent in March from a month
earlier after a 1.1 percent gain in February, the service said.
Economists forecast an increase of 1 percent, according to the
median of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
