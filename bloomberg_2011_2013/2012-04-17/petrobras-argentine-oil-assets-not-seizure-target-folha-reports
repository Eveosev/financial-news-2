Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s assets in
Argentina are not an expropriation target after the country
seized control of  YPF SA (YPFD)  from Spain’s  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Folha de
S.Paulo reported.  The Argentine government has already assured Petrobras, as
the Brazilian state-run oil producer is known, that the seizure
of its assets is not being considered, Folha said, citing a
person with knowledge of the talks that it didn’t name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
