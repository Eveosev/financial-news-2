Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  joined leading Republicans closing ranks behind Mitt Romney, saying he supports him for the party’s presidential
nomination.  “We’re all behind him,” McConnell told reporters in
Washington today.  The Kentucky Republican commented a few hours after U.S.
House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said he will be “proud to
support” Romney and will “do everything I can to help him
win.”  Boehner told reporters it’s now “clear” that Romney, a
former Massachusetts governor, will be the party standard-
bearer.  Both congressional leaders had been neutral in the
presidential race. Romney emerged as the presumptive Republican
nominee after his main challenger, former Senator Rick Santorum
of Pennsylvania, announced on April 10 he was ending his
candidacy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
