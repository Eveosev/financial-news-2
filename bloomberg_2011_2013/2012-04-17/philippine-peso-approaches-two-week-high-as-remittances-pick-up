The Philippine peso rose toward a
two-week high following a pickup in transfers from Filipinos
living overseas.  Remittances grew 5.8 percent from a year earlier to $1.59
billion in February, after increasing 5.4 percent in January,
the central bank said yesterday. Exports increased 14.6 percent
from a year earlier in February, the most in 10 months, the
government reported last week.  “We remain quite positive on the peso,” said Goh Puay Yeong, a Singapore-based foreign-exchange strategist at Credit
Suisse Group AG. “Part of the reason is the recovery in
Philippine exports and remittances continue to be pretty
robust.”  The peso appreciated 0.3 percent to 42.65 per dollar at the
close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
touched 42.585 on April 13, the strongest level since April 3.
One-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady at 5.70 percent.  The yield on the Philippines’ 8 percent bonds due July 2031
was unchanged at 6.15 percent, according to prices from
Tradition Financial Services. Yesterday’s closing level of 6.15
percent was the highest rate for the note in four weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
