Slovenia will spend 700 million
euros ($920 million) to pay interest on government debt this
year, Prime Minister Janez Jansa said in an interview with  TV
Slovenija .  “We will borrow up to 1.5 billion euros this year and
about 700 million euros will go for interest payments only,”
Jansa told the public broadcaster today.  Slovenia hired BNP Paribas SA,  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  to organize
presentations with investors in Europe starting on March 26, the
Finance Ministry has said. The euro member is seeking to raise
1.5 billion euros and hasn’t “decided on the exact date for the
bond sale,” Finance Minister Janez Sustersic said on April 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
