Enjoy SA (ENJOY) , a Santiago-based casino
owner, said holders of its bonds agreed to give the company
until the end of the year to bring its net debt below 4.5 times
earnings before exceptional items without suffering penalties.  Enjoy announced the agreement in a statement to the
securities regulator today.  The terms of the bonds, first sold in 2010, specified that
the company had to get that ratio below “4.5 times during the
year 2012, and four times from the year 2013 onwards.” The
ratio stood at 5.66 times at the end of 2011, according to
Enjoy’s financial results for that year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
