The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and corporate debt was little
changed, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments rose two basis points to 282 at
8:14 a.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 1.5 basis
points to 678.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings was little changed at 144 basis
points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose 1.25 basis points to 251.25 and the
subordinated index climbed two to 408.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
