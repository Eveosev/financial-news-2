The  International Monetary Fund 
trimmed its forecast for  Poland ’s  economic growth  this year to
2.6 percent from 3 percent in a September report as the euro
area’s debt crisis weighs on trade and lending growth.  The Washington-based lender also raised its estimate for
Poland’s annual  average inflation  to 3.8 percent in 2012 from
its previous prediction of 2.8 percent. The economy will expand
3.2 percent next year with inflation averaging 2.7 percent, the
IMF projected.  While Poland will post  Europe ’s second-fastest growth in
2012 after Russia, it won’t be immune from a forecast
contraction of 0.3 percent in the euro area, the IMF said.
Cross-border production chains have tied the region’s trade to
the euro area and especially to  Germany , while western European
banks cut their exposure to eastern Europe by almost 5 percent
in the third quarter of 2011, curbing local access to credit,
the fund said in its World Economic Outlook.  “Reflecting these spillovers, and notwithstanding improved
euro-area sentiment, growth in eastern Europe is expected to
slow sharply this year, and downside risks are significant,”
the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
