Israel’s short-term  government
bonds  fell, lifting the yield the most in two weeks, on bets the
central bank will leave borrowing costs on hold for a third
month as energy costs spur inflation.  The yield on the 3.5 percent notes due September 2013
climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.66
percent at 1:25 p.m. in Tel Aviv. Shorter-term notes are
typically more sensitive to rate fluctuations. The two-year
break-even rate, the yield difference between inflation-linked
bonds and fixed-rate government bonds of similar maturity, rose
four basis points to 299. That implies an average annual
inflation rate of 2.99 percent.  Israeli consumer prices are expected to rise by 2.5 percent
in the next 12 months, according to a survey of economists
released by the  Bank of Israel  today. Prices gained for the
first time in five months in March, advancing 0.4 percent from
February, the statistics bureau said this week. The central bank
will keep the benchmark interest rate at 2.5 percent on April
23, according to all 16 economists in a Bloomberg  survey.   “Inflation expectations are expected to increase in coming
months amid rising energy prices which is pushing government
bonds lower,” said Effi Cohen, a bond trader at  Leader Capital
Markets (LDRC)  Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “The market is pricing in that the
central bank will pause on  interest rates  and start to raise
rates in coming 12 months.”  Electricity prices will rise 8.9 percent, the Public
Utilities Authority said in a March 25 statement on its website.
 Israel ’s purchasing managers index rose to 46.3 in March from
44.5 in the previous month, Bank Hapoalim Ltd. said today. The
economy grew an annualized 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter,
faster than the 3.2 percent previously estimated, the statistics
bureau said yesterday.  The yield on the benchmark 5.5 percent bonds due January
2022 rose two basis points to 4.65 percent.  One-year interest-
rate swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates over
the period, increased for a fourth day, advancing one basis
point to 2.58 percent.  The Tel-Bond 40 index of corporate bonds gained 0.2 percent
to 266.56. The shekel weakened 0.2 percent to 3.7561 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
