Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) ,
eastern  Europe ’s third-biggest lender, plans to complete the
purchase of  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) ’s Polish unit by the end of
the second quarter after winning regulatory approval.  Raiffeisen got authorization to buy Polbank EFG, and will
combine it with its Raiffeisen Bank Polska SA unit, KNF, the
Polish regulator, said in an e-mailed statement. Raiffeisen
pledged to sell at least a 15 percent of the combined Polish
division on the  Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW)  by June 2016, KNF said.  The Polbank acquisition will make Raiffeisen one of the
biggest lenders in eastern Europe’s largest economy, and the
unit will become the Vienna-based bank’s biggest foreign unit
after Russia. The deal is part of Chief Executive Officer
Herbert Stepic’s strategy to bolster the bank’s presence in the
eastern part of the European Union, while lowering the
dependency on units in the former  Soviet Union .  Raiffeisen agreed to pay 490 million euros ($643 million)
for 70 percent of unprofitable Polbank in February 2011 and has
since worked on getting regulatory approval. Some “technical
measures” still have to be finalized before the deal can be
closed, Raiffeisen spokeswoman Susanne Langer said. That will
happen within the coming weeks and by the end of the quarter,
she said.  Parent Raiffeisen may also publicly trade its own shares in
Warsaw by June 2018, the regulator said, adding that in case
this is “impossible” it will have to increase the Polish
unit’s free float to at least 25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
