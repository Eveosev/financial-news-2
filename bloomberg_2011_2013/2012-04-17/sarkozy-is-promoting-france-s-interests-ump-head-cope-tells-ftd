 French President  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
call for the European Central Bank to promote economic growth
shows he is promoting France’s interests, the head of his party
told the  Financial Times Deutschland .  Jean-Francois Cope, who leads the Union Pour Mouvement
Populaire, said in an interview published today that France will
be “as demanding on its euro-area partners as they are,”
backing Sarkozy’s call on ECB policy adjustments, the FTD
reported. France agreed to budget cuts that are “desires that
stem from Germany,” Cope said, according to the newspaper.  At the same time, Sarkozy and the UMP differ on fiscal
policy from their Socialist challengers in this year’s
presidential race, he said. The party will stick to budget-
cutting policies and ease the economy’s dependence on domestic
consumption, he said.  “ Europe  must surely hope for the victory of Nicolas
Sarkozy,” said Cope, who denied that the French president’s
relationship to German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has cooled.  To contact the reporter on this story:
