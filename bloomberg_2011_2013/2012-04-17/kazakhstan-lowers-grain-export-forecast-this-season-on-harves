Kazakhstan  lowered its grain export
forecast for this season because of a lack of rail cars,
according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  “We plan to export around 11 million to 12 million metric
tons this marketing year,” Anna Buts, head of the farming
department at the Agriculture Ministry, told reporters today in
Astana, the capital. “We haven’t reached the average monthly
export target of 1.2 million tons in the past few months because
of a lack of rail cars.”  Kazakhstan has exported 8.4 million tons, including 5.6
million tons of grain and 2.8 million tons of flour in grain
equivalent weight from the start of the season on July 1 to
April 1, Buts said.  Most exports were sent within Central Asia and to  Iran ,
with almost 90,000 tons carried to  China , she said.  Kazakhstan may export 13 million tons this season, Grain
Union President Nurlan Tleubayev said on April 2. The country
has the potential to ship 15 million tons abroad, according to
the Agriculture Ministry.  The Central Asian nation has less than half the 10,500 rail
cars needed for grain exports, with only 4,500 of the country’s
5,200 wagons in “working condition,” the ministry said on Jan.
24.  The grain  harvest  may slump by more than 50 percent this
year to 13 million tons to 15 million tons, Deputy Agriculture
Minister Muslim Umiryayev said Feb. 21. Last year’s crop reached
a record 26.9 million tons, according to the State Statistics
Agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
