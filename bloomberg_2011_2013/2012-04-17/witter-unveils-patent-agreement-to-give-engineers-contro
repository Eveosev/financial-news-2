Twitter Inc. , the microblogging
service, published a draft of an “Innovator’s Patent
Agreement,” an effort to ensure that engineers and designers
can maintain control over their own intellectual property.  The  IPA  is a commitment to Twitter employees that patents
can’t be used in “offensive litigation” without the permission
of the workers behind the inventions, said Adam Messinger, vice
president of engineering, on a company  blog  today. If the
patents are sold, they could only be used as the inventor
intended, San Francisco-based Twitter said.  Twitter’s proposed agreement comes as some of the biggest
technology companies, including  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and
Yahoo! Inc., face off in courts worldwide over patents covering
mobile, social networking and advertising. Twitter has started
to reach out to other companies to discuss the agreement, which
is meant to shift power over patented innovations from companies
to employees.  “Typically, engineers and designers sign an agreement with
their company that irrevocably gives that company any patents
filed related to the employee’s work,” Messinger wrote. “With
the IPA, employees can be assured that their patents will be
used only as a shield rather than as a weapon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
