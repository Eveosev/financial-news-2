Investors may be selling lead amid
prospects for supply of the metal to exceed demand this year,
according to Societe Generale SA.  The number of London Metal Exchange lead contracts
outstanding, or  open interest , reached the highest level since
at least 2005 on April 10, while prices for three-month delivery
were down 0.8 percent this year at that date. The combination
suggests “investors have been selling lead,” analyst  Robin Bhar  said today at a Metal Bulletin conference in Warsaw.  Prices will probably average $2,280 a metric ton on the LME
this year, according to Bhar. That compares with about $2,390
for the three-month contract in 2011 and about $2,397 for cash
metal, data compiled by Bloomberg shows. Production will run
ahead of usage by 250,000 tons this year, the analyst said.  “Investors and speculators now look to be playing lead
from the short side,” Bhar said. Prices will be “buffeted by
external factors” such as economic figures and exchange-rate
movements, he said.  Lead for three-month delivery rose 0.8 percent to $2,094 a
ton by 4:13 p.m. on the LME. The metal, used in batteries and
radiation shielding, fell 20 percent last year amid concern
about the strength of Chinese demand and the euro-area
sovereign-debt crisis.  Prices will be “trapped in a range” of $2,000 to $2,400 a
ton in the next few months before averaging $2,400 in the fourth
quarter as demand improves, according to Bhar. That compares
with an average of about $2,109 this year for three-month metal,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
