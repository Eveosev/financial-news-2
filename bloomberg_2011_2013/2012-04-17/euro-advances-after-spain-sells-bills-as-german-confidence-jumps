The yen fell versus most of its 16
most-traded peers as a report showing German investor confidence
rose to a two-year high fueled appetite for riskier assets.  Canada ’s dollar gained the most in four months against its
U.S. counterpart as the central bank said higher  interest rates 
“may become appropriate” because economic growth will be
faster than forecast. The euro was buoyed against the yen as
increased demand at a Spanish bill auction eased concern
Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  South Africa ’s rand climbed.  “Confidence being higher than expected is a positive
thing; one of the stories of the year is the resilience of
Europe,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of currency strategy at Bank
of  Nova Scotia  in Toronto. “The shift in the statement from the
 Bank of Canada  was larger than many had expected. The risk now
becomes that we’ve come too far, too fast in expectations.”  The yen fell 0.5 percent to 80.85 per dollar at 5 p.m. New
York time. It weakened 0.4 percent against the euro to 106.11
after gaining earlier as much as 0.4 percent. The euro slipped
0.1 percent to $1.3127 after dropping yesterday below $1.30 for
the first time in two months.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.6 percent, and
the MSCI World Index jumped 1.6 percent.  The  International Monetary Fund  raised its economic growth
estimates. Its World Economic Outlook forecast the global
economy will expand 3.5 percent this year and 4.1 percent in
2013, an increase from its January projections of 3.3 percent
growth in 2012 and 4 percent next year.  Loonie Advances  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is nicknamed,
strengthened as much as 1.3 percent, the biggest intraday jump
since Nov. 30, to 98.65 cents per  U.S. dollar  before closing at
99.02 cents, up 0.9 percent.  The Bank of Canada said the nation’s economy will reach full
output in the first half of next year, sooner than a January
forecast for the third quarter of 2013. It predicted that  Europe 
will emerge from recession later this year and the U.S. recovery
will be stronger than policy makers expected. The BOC kept its
key  interest rate  unchanged today at 1 percent, as forecast by
all 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “If Canada were an island in the Pacific, isolated like
Australia, then you would say its present monetary policy stance
is way too accommodative,” said  Greg Anderson , the North
American head of Group-of-10 nations currency strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in New York. “It’s a question if they’ll move
this year or next.”  Gain for Week  The Canadian dollar rose 0.9 percent over the past week
against nine developed-nation counterparts monitored by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, sharing the top
spot with  Australia ’s dollar. The yen, the worst performer, fell
1.1 percent and the greenback lost 0.8 percent.  Brazil’s real  was the biggest loser against the greenback,
declining to a three-month low after the central bank bought
dollars to protect exporters from a strong local tender. The
currency slid as much as 0.8 percent to 1.8612 per dollar, the
weakest level since Jan. 3, before trading at $1.8611.  The  implied volatility  of three-month options for Group of
Seven currencies declined 1.3 percent to 9.66 percent, the
lowest level since August 2008. The average over the past decade
is 10.6 percent. A decrease makes investments in currencies with
higher benchmark rates more attractive because it shows the risk
is greater that market moves will erase profits on such trades.  Biggest Winner  South Africa’s rand was the biggest winner against the
dollar after Citigroup Inc. said the nation’s government bonds
may be included in its global index. That may fuel demand from
investors who track the gauge. The requirements for inclusion
are size,  credit quality  and a lack of barriers to entry.  The rand climbed 1.6 percent to 7.8135 per dollar and
touched 7.7859, the strongest level since April 5.  Mexico ’s peso
gained 0.8 percent to 13.1070 to the greenback.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, was little changed at 79.552. It touched
80.176 yesterday, the strongest level in a month.  The euro gained versus the yen as the Frankfurt-based
Bundesbank said the German economy, Europe’s largest, is in
“remarkably good shape.” Growth should gather pace as
unemployment at a two-decade low fuels domestic demand, it said
in a statement today.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations  increased  to
23.4 in April, the highest since June 2010, from 22.3 in March.
The gauge is designed to predict economic developments six
months in advance. A Bloomberg survey had forecast a drop to 19.  ‘Greater Barometer’  “When you get ongoing increases to German investor
confidence, that is a greater barometer to the health of Europe
than rising Spanish bond yields,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , chief
economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in  New York .  Demand for Spanish 12-month bills offered today was 2.9
times the amount sold, compared with 2.14 times last month, Bank
of  Spain  data showed. The bid-to-cover ratio for 18-month notes
was 3.77, compared with 2.93 on March 20. The  yield  on the
nation’s 10-year bond slid 18 basis points, or 0.18 percentage
point, to 5.89 percent, after rising yesterday to 6.16 percent.  The euro’s gains were limited before Spain auctions 2-year
and 10-year securities tomorrow.  The 17-nation currency is being supported by its February
low of $1.2974, according to data compiled Bloomberg. Support
refers to an area on a yield graph where buy orders may be
clustered. The stronger the support, the more selling is needed
to break through it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
