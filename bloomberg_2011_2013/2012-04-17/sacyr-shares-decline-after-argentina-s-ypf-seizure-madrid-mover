Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) , the Spanish
builder which holds 10 percent in  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , led stocks of
companies with assets in Argentina lower after the country
seized the local unit of Spain’s biggest oil company.  Sacyr fell as much as 10.5 percent, the steepest intraday
drop since March 1, and traded down 5.5 percent at 1.9 euros as
of 11:29 a.m. Repsol dropped 6.6 percent to 16.33 euros.  “This opens up a very dangerous path in which other
companies with a presence there will face big short-term
uncertainty,” Francisco Salvador, a Madrid-based strategist at
FGA/MG Valores, said by phone today. “Yesterday’s decision by
Argentina’s president is a symptom of the country’s own
problems.”  Other Spanish companies with a big presence in  Argentina 
include security services business  Prosegur Cia de Seguridad SA 
and casino operator  Codere SA. (CDR)  Prosegur fell 3.6 percent to
42.96 euros and Codere slipped 0.9 percent to 6.49 euros.  Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ordered
the seizure of YPF SA, Argentina’s largest crude producer,
majority-owned by Madrid-based Repsol, after a dispute about
slumping oil output and investments. She is sending a bill to
Argentina’s Congress to take a 51 percent stake in the company.
The Spanish government pledged to take “decisive” action
against Argentina within days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
