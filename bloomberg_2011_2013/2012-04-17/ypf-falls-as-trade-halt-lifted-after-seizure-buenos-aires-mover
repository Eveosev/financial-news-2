YPF SA (YPFD)  fell to a three-year low in
Buenos Aires as the bourse lifted a trading halt imposed
yesterday after the government announced it would expropriate 51
percent of Argentina’s largest oil company.  YPF plunged 7.3 percent to 107.50 pesos at 12:58 p.m. in
Buenos Aires, the lowest since May 2009. YPF has retreated 9.6
percent in the last two days, leading losses among members of
the Merval benchmark index in the period, after the government
announced the seizure.  Argentina’s government sent a bill to Congress yesterday to
seize 51 percent of YPF from  Spain ’s  Repsol YPF SA. (REP)  It also took
over management of the company, appointing Planning Minister
Julio De Vido as chief executive officer, ousting Sebastian Eskenazi.  “The announcement creates uncertainty on the value of the
shares even as the government is going after Repsol’s stake, not
the free floating shares,” Marcelo Olguin, chief economist at
Buenos Aires-based brokerage Grupo SBS, said in a phone
interview.  Trading in YPF shares had been suspended since 12:34 p.m.
yesterday. The  Buenos Aires  exchange lifted the suspension
today, it said in a statement on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
