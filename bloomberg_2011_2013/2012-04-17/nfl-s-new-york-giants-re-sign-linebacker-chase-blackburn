The  New York Giants  re-signed
linebacker Chase Blackburn, whose fourth-quarter interception
helped the National Football League team win last season’s  Super
Bowl , the Giants said today in a news release.  Blackburn, 28, intercepted a throw from New England
Patriots quarterback Tom Brady 49 yards downfield on the second
play of the final period to help the Giants to a 21-17 win.  Blackburn joined the Giants as a rookie free agent one
month before training camp in 2005 and has spent his entire
career with the team. He played in the final five games of last
year’s regular season and started all four playoff games at
middle linebacker, finishing the postseason with 25 tackles,
second on the team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
