U.S. stock-index futures maintained
gains even after housing starts unexpectedly declined as
declines in Spanish and Italian bond yields eased concern about
 Europe ’s debt crisis.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
increased 0.5 percent to 1,370.6 at 8:32 a.m. in New York.
Housing starts dropped 5.8 percent to a 654,000 annual rate,
less than the lowest estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News and the least since October, Commerce Department
figures showed today in Washington. The slump was led by the
volatile multifamily category, which at the same time showed a
jump in permits, a proxy for future construction.  The  S&P 500  has lost 3.5 percent since closing at an almost
four-year high on April 2 amid renewed concern about Europe’s
debt crisis and slower economic growth in  China . A 4.2 percent
slump in Apple Inc. yesterday helped drag the index down less
than 0.1 percent, even most U.S. stocks rose and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed 72 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
