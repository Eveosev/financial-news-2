China  will start construction of
the $630 million Neskra hydropower plant in Georgia this week,
the former Soviet republic said as it seeks to cut dependence on
fossil-fuel imports from neighboring  Russia .  Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili will attend the
groundbreaking ceremony for the 210-megawatt plant, which will
start generating in 2017, said Manana Manjgaladze, his
spokeswoman.  Sinohydro Group Ltd. (601669)  will build the plant, Nino
Kikacheishvili, a spokeswoman for Georgia’s Energy Ministry,
said by telephone from Tbilisi today. A call to the investor
relations department at Sinohydro wasn’t answered after regular
business hours.  Georgia expects to invest as much $2.5 billion in
hydropower projects in the next few years, following 12 ventures
planned for this year, Saakashvili said in a speech to
parliament last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
