Economies that use the euro
probably will shrink further as governments cut spending and
banks seek to lend less, said New York University Professor
 Nouriel Roubini .  “It’s like a slow-motion train wreck,” Roubini, the
economist who predicted the 2008 financial crisis, said today at
a conference in Santiago, Chile.  Greece  won’t be the last euro-zone country to restructure
debt and may exit the euro in 2013 or 2014 along with another
small country, the co-founder of Roubini Global Economics LLC
said. Roubini also said he doesn’t expect a self-sustaining
recovery in the U.S. anytime soon.  The so-called BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India and
 China  are “over-hyped” and require reforms to sustain growth,
he said. China, which may face a “hard landing” in a few
years, needs to grow private consumption as a percentage of
gross domestic product, Roubini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
