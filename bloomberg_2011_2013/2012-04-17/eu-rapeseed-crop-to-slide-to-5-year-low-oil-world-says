The European Union rapeseed crop is
forecast to slide 3.3 percent to a five-year low after freezing
weather damaged fields, Oil World said.  Farmers in the 27-nation EU are expected to harvest 18.5
million metric tons of the oilseed this year, falling from 19.1
million tons a year earlier on a smaller harvested area, the
Hamburg-based oilseed researcher wrote in a report today.  The EU typically grows about a third of the world’s
rapeseed crop of about 60 million tons, based on U.S. Department
of Agriculture data. The oilseed is used to make cooking oil and
animal feed and is processed into biodiesel.  “A disaster is shaping up for this year’s rapeseed
production in some parts of the European Union,” Oil World
wrote. “Winter killing and fungus infestation have come on top
of the detrimental conditions last autumn when planting of
rapeseed declined and when very dry conditions resulted in poor
germination of the crop.”  Rapeseed production in  France , the EU’s biggest grower, may
slide to 5.2 million tons from 5.35 million tons in 2011. In
 Romania , farmers may harvest 180,000 tons of the oilseed, less
than a third of the 670,000 brought in last year, while
 Bulgaria ’s crop may slide to 270,000 tons from 520,000 tons.  In  Germany , where rapeseed fields suffered from a spring
drought last year, output may climb to 4.45 million tons from
3.9 million tons, according to the researcher.  Farmers in Germany will plow under at least 70,000 to
80,000 hectares (172,974 to 197,684 acres) of rapeseed because
of winter damage, cutting the harvested area to 1.23 million
hectares from 1.33 million hectares in 2011, Oil World wrote.  In  Canada , farmers are expected to increase planting of
canola by 500,000 to 1 million hectares from last year’s 7.6
million hectares, the researcher wrote. Canada is the world’s
largest grower of the oilseed ahead of  China ,  USDA data  show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
