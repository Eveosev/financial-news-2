The Czech government won’t meet its
target of cutting the fiscal  deficit  to less than the European
Union’s limit next year, according to International Monetary
Fund forecasts published today.  The Washington-based lender forecast the Czech shortfall at
3.4 percent of economic output, compared with the government’s
goal of 2.9 percent, according to an update of the IMF’s World
Economic Outlook, published today. The Cabinet of Prime Minister
Petr Necas will meet its deficit goal of 3.5 percent of GDP this
year, the fund said.  The 20-month-old government plans to narrow the public
finance deficit, the fiscal yardstick for assessing an EU
member’s readiness to adopt the euro, to 1.9 percent of gross
domestic product in 2014, while the IMF sees the gap at 3.2
percent that year. The condition for entering the euro region is
a deficit no larger than 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
