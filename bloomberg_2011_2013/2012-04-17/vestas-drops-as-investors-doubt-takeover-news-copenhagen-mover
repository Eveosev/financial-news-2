     April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Vestas Wind Systems A/S, the
world’s largest turbine maker, slumped the most in more than a
month in Copenhagen trading as investors deemed speculation that
the company is close to being bought to be overdone.  The shares dropped 5.6 percent to 52.45 kroner, the most
since March 6, making it the worst performer on the Copenhagen
benchmark index today. Vestas shares have plunged 15 percent
this year versus a 17 percent increase in the main  OMXC20 index .  “Clearly, there is no more news out there to support hopes
for a Vestas bid following yesterday’s report,” said  Jacob Pedersen , an analyst at Aabenraa, Denmark-based Sydbank A/S.
“Investment bankers are also signaling that yesterday’s story
may have been nothing more than someone trying to talk up the
stock and that a takeover would be a complicated undertaking.”  Vestas soared 13 percent yesterday after Danish newspaper
Jyllands-Posten reported that Chinese turbine makers Sinovel
Wind Group Co. and Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co.
were considering a bid for the Aarhus, Denmark-based company
after its share price collapsed.  “A buyout is not right around the corner,” Lars
Moegeltoft and Jesper Bamberger, equity advisers at Nordea
Private Banking in Copenhagen, wrote in a note to clients. “The
stock will fall when merger rumors subside and focus returns to
market conditions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
