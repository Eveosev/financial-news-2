The Czech Public Affairs party, the
smallest partner in the ruling coalition, split today after two
members, including Deputy Premier Karolina Peake, left.  Peake left Public Affairs today because of “its
destructive political style” without giving up her mandate in
parliament and will continue to support the Cabinet, according
to an e-mailed statement. Another Public Affairs member of
parliament, Viktor Paggio, told public Czech Television he would
follow Peake, who is seeking to form her own faction.  It isn’t clear whether the government still commands a
parliamentary majority, Finance Minister Miroslav Kalousek, a
member of TOP09, another ruling party, told the Czech Television
in an interview.  Premier Petr Necas, the chairman of the Civic Democrats,
overcame a rebellion by Public Affairs’ leadership last week and
united his government behind a plan to cut spending and boost
revenue. The Czechs want to cut the fiscal deficit to less than
the European Union limit of 3 percent of economic output next
year from a planned 3.5 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
