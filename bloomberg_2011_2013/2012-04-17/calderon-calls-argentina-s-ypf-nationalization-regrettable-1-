Mexican President Felipe Calderon
said  Argentina ’s plan to seize 51 percent of oil company  YPF SA, (YPFD) 
the nation’s largest crude producer, is “very regrettable.”  “No one in their right mind would invest in a country that
expropriates investments,” Calderon said today in Nuevo
Vallarta, Mexico, according to a transcript of his remarks
during the World Economic Forum on Latin America.  Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner seized
control of YPF SA, ousting Spanish owner  Repsol YPF SA (REP) 
after a dispute over slumping oil output and investments.  Argentina took over management of YPF with immediate
effect, replacing Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Eskenazi
with Planning Minister Julio De Vido, Fernandez said yesterday
in a speech in  Buenos Aires . The government will also send a
bill to Congress to take a 51 percent stake in YPF, she said.  “This is absolutely a not very responsible measure,”
Calderon said. “It is clearly in violation of treaties and
accords about the reciprocity of investments.”  The takeover follows more than two months of increasing
government pressure on YPF after fuel imports doubled to $9.4
billion last year. The country sought to block YPF dividends and
backed provincial governments when they revoked 15 oil field
licenses. Fernandez also seized a $24 billion pension fund and
airline Aerolineas Argentinas SA since taking office in 2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
