Russia  may export record amounts of
wheat, corn and legumes in the marketing year that ends June 30,
the Institute for Agricultural Markets said.  Russia has surpassed already the previous record for  wheat
exports  after shipping 18.5 million metric tons, and its total
wheat shipments for the season are seen at 20 million tons, said
Oleg Sukhanov, head of markets analysis at the institute, known
as Ikar, by phone in Moscow today.  The prior wheat-shipments record was 18.1 million tons in
2009-10, he said. Corn exports have reached about 1.2 million
tons so far this season, about 100,000 tons short of the
previous record in 2008-09, he said. Exports of peas and other
legumes reached an all-time high 600,000 tons, he said.  Most of Russia’s grains and legumes are shipped to North
Africa and the  Middle East , according to Ikar.  Carryover-stocks of wheat may reach as much as 11.5 million
tons by the time the new season starts on July 1, which may
allow Russia to export 17 million to 18 million tons of the
cereal next season, provided weather conditions let farmers reap
a similar crop to the previous year’s, Sukhanov said. Total
grains exports in the next season are seen at between 21 million
and 22 million tons, he said.  Russia’s grain shipments are expected to be a record 26
million tons this season, SovEcon, a Moscow-based agricultural
researcher, said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
