Deven Choksey, managing director at
K.R. Choksey Shares & Securities, comments on  India ’s interest
rates and company earnings. The  Reserve Bank of India  today
reduced the repurchase rate to 8 percent from 8.5 percent, an
outcome predicted by only three of 25 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. Choksey spoke in a telephone interview from Mumbai.  “The impact on earnings will happen with a lag effect. It
will not happen in just one quarter. It will be the second half
of the financial year before we see any effect on corporate
results due to the RBI’s actions.  ‘‘If crude oil stays around $110 a barrel and we have a
monsoon, which is above normal or normal, then we may see
accelerated rate cuts over the second half of the financial
year.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
