Swiss stocks  rallied the most in 10
weeks, led by  Nestle SA (NESN)  and bank shares, after Spain sold more
debt than it targeted at an auction.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , Switzerland’s biggest
lenders, jumped more than 3.5 percent.  Schindler Holding AG (SCHP) 
added 2.9 percent after Credit Suisse recommended buying the
shares.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  gained 1.2 percent to 6,200.27 at
the close in Zurich, the biggest increase since February 3. The
gauge yesterday rebounded from its longest stretch of weekly
losses since November and has  advanced  4.5 percent so far in
2012 as euro-area leaders took measures to contain the region’s
debt crisis and as U.S. economic reports surpassed estimates.
The broader Swiss Performance Index climbed 1.4 percent today.  Spain  sold 3.18 billion euros ($4.18 billion) of bills
today, against a target of 3 billion euros. The nation will
auction debt due in 2014 and 2022 on April 19. Spanish bonds
extended gains after the auction with the yield in the 10-year
benchmark bond falling 16 basis points to 5.91 percent.  “Today’s auction is a good sign and will provide some
support for the market,” said  Markus Wallner , an equity
strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. “But investors will
keep a sharp eye on the Spanish 10-year bond yields until
Thursday at its bond auction.”  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  has repeatedly said
that the country won’t need a bailout. He said yesterday that
there was no alternative to austerity. “Budget discipline and
the rationalization of the public sector are good and necessary
reforms.”  Global Growth  Stocks extended gains after the  International Monetary Fund 
raised its global growth forecast. The world economy will expand
3.5 percent this year and 4.1 percent in 2013, the Washington-
based IMF said, raising forecasts made in January. The U.S. will
grow 2.1 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 2013, the IMF
said.  In the U.S., a report showed that  housing starts  in March
unexpectedly dropped to a 654,000 annual rate, the lowest in
five months, following a revised 694,000 pace the prior month.
Economists had called for an increase to 705,000.  A separate report showed that industrial production in the
U.S. was unchanged in March for a second month. The output last
month at factories, mines and utilities compared with a median
projection for a 0.3 percent increase in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists, data from the Federal Reserve showed today in
Washington.  Nestle Gains  Nestle, the world’s largest food company, climbed 1.3
percent to 56.75 Swiss francs after peer Danone SA reported
first-quarter revenue growth that topped analysts’ estimates.  UBS and Credit Suisse gained 4 percent to 11.82 francs and
3.6 percent to 24.60 francs, respectively.  Julius Baer Group
Ltd. (BAER)  increased 2.8 percent to 36.09 francs. A gauge of European
bank shares was the best  performer  of the 19 industry groups in
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Schindler rose 2.9 percent to 112.90 francs, its highest
price in a year, after Credit Suisse raised the maker of
escalators to outperform, the equivalent of buy, from neutral.  Sulzer AG (SUN) , the world’s second biggest maker of pumps, added
4.8 percent to 126.60 francs. First-quarter  orders  rose 9.1
percent to 1 billion francs. The company said it sees 2012
orders growing by a “high single digit” percentage.  Galenica AG (GALN)  gained 1.9 percent to 602.50 francs after
saying a clinical study showed a dose of Ferinject rapidly
improved fatigue symptoms in iron deficient, non-anemic women.  To contact the reporter on this story:
