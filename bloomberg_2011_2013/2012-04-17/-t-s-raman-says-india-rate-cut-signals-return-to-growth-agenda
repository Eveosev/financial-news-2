R. Shankar Raman, chief financial
officer at  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , India’s biggest builder of
power networks and airports, comments on  interest rates . He
spoke in a telephone interview from Mumbai.  The  Reserve Bank  of India today cut the repurchase rate to
8 percent from 8.5 percent. The decision was predicted by three
of 25 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  On inflation:  The rate cut “is a step toward changing sentiment. Instead
of trying to do it in small steps, Reserve Bank has decided to
move ahead in a very definitive manner with a 50 basis point
cut, thereby signaling that it is willing to get growth back on
the agenda and willing to let go off inflation for the time
being.  ‘‘Latent inflation masked by subsidies is still a threat.
 oil prices  are still a threat.  ‘‘Most importantly are banks going to pass on the lower
costs? Ability of banks to transmit the reduction in rates is
key.’’  On Larsen & Toubro:  ‘‘We’ve not been a large borrower in the domestic market.
To that extent this will not make a significant difference to
our own scheme of things.  ‘‘But when it comes to all our infrastructure projects,
where we’ve bid for concessions, softer interest rates will
help. Sustainability of this softer interest-rate regime through
the quarter or half-year is going to be important for us to get
benefit out of this.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
