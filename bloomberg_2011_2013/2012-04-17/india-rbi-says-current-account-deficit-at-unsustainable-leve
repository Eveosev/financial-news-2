India's central bank said the
nation's current account deficit at 4.3 percent of gross domestic
product is ``unsustainable.''  Authorities need to contain the deficit, the  Reserve Bank  of
India said in its annual policy review. ``With global capital
flows to emerging markets projected at lower levels in 2012,
financing of the deficit will continue to pose a major
challenge,'' the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
