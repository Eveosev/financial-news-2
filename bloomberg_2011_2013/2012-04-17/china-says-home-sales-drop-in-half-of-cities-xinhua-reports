Half of the 44 monitored in  China 
saw a decline in commercial home-sales in the April 9 to April
15 period from a year earlier, Xinhua News Agency said, citing
statistics from the China Index Academy.  Home transactions in nine cities tumbled more than 50
percent, with Qingdao in the eastern province of Shandong having
the biggest drop, of 76 percent, Xinhua said. The decline in
volumes slowed in seven of 10 “key” cities, Xinhua said in a
separate report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
