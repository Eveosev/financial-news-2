Treasuries fell for the first time
in three days after  Spain  raised more than its maximum target at
a bill auction and  Germany ’s ZEW report showed investor
confidence unexpectedly rose, damping demand for safer assets.  Ten-year  note yields  climbed from the lowest level in six
weeks before U.S. reports today that economists said will show
home starts increased and industrial output expanded, adding to
signs the recovery is gaining momentum. Treasuries have handed
investors a loss of 0.1 percent this year, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of stocks
returned 9.5 percent including reinvested dividends.  “Risk sentiment has improved modestly since the ZEW data
and Spain’s bill auction,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in London. “Peripheral
bond markets are better bid and consequently core markets such
as Treasuries and bunds are better offered.”  The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year note climbed three basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.01 percent at 7:14 a.m.
in  New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2
percent security due in February 2022 fell 7/32, or $2.19 per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 30/32. The yield dropped to 1.94
percent yesterday, the least since March 6.  Spain sold 3.18 billion euros ($4.18 billion) of 12- and
18-month bills, surpassing the government’s target of 3 billion
euros. The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its  index  of German investor and analyst expectations
unexpectedly climbed for a fifth month to the highest level
since June 2010.  Home Starts  U.S. home starts rose to a 705,000 annual rate in March
following a 698,000 pace the previous month, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before the Commerce Department data today.
Industrial production gained 0.3 percent in March after being
little changed in February, a separate survey of economists
showed before the  Federal Reserve  releases the figure.  The 10-year Treasury yield will likely remain in a near-
term range of 1.95 percent to 2.05 percent, Lloyds’s Wand said.
“Unless we see signs of unequivocally positive data out of the
U.S., then higher yields will still attract buyers,” he said.
“The European situation is decidedly uncertain.”  Ten-year Treasury yields were below 2 percent for a third
day in earlier trading. Yields less than 2 percent may be too
low given the signs of a U.S. economic recovery, according to
Toyota Asset Management Co., a unit of the world’s biggest
automaker by market value.  ‘Recovering Modestly’  “The  U.S. economy  keeps recovering modestly,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , who helps oversee the equivalent of $22 billion as
chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management in  Tokyo . “Yields
at current levels are too low.”  The 10-year yield will increase to 2.57 percent by year-
end, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
financial companies with the most recent projections given the
heaviest weightings.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, has widened to 2.27 percentage points from
1.95 percentage points at the end of last year. The average over
the past decade is 2.14 percentage points.  The five-year, five-year forward break-even rate, a  measure 
of traders’ inflation expectations that the Fed uses to help
guide monetary policy was at 2.71 percent on April 12, below its
2.76 percent average during the past decade.  TIPS Sale  The U.S. plans to sell $16 billion of five-year TIPS on
April 19. Merrill Lynch’s TIPS index has gained 2.5 percent this
year, reflecting demand for inflation protection.  The Fed has pledged to keep its benchmark  interest rate 
near zero until late 2014 to support growth. The U.S. central
bank is also replacing $400 billion of shorter-term debt in its
holdings with longer maturities to hold down borrowing costs. It
is scheduled to buy as much as $2 billion of Treasuries due from
2036 to 2042 today as part of the program, according to the New
York Fed’s  website .  The 30-year bond yield may fall toward a seven-week low
should it break below its 100-day moving average at 3.11
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate
dropped to 3.09 percent yesterday, the lowest since March 7. The
yield may find support at its Feb. 28 low of 3.02 percent.
Support refers to an area where buy orders may be clustered.  The yield on the 30-year Treasury increased two basis
points today to 3.15 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
