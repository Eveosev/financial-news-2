The euro area’s debt crisis is
reigniting and may cause more turmoil this year than in 2011,
Lars Feld, a member of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council
of economic advisers, was quoted as saying by  Bild .  The  European Central Bank ’s efforts to stem the crisis are
only having a short-term effect and the French presidential
election is causing uncertainty, the Berlin-based newspaper said
in an e-mailed summary of an article for today’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
