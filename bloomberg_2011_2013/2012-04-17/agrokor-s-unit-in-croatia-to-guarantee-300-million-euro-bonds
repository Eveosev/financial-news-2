Konzum d.d ., a retail unit of
 Croatia ’s biggest private company Agrokor d.d., said it will
provide guarantees for seven-year bonds worth the equivalent of
at least 300 million euros ($394 million).  The bonds, planned by Agrokor, will be denominated in euros
or in U.S. dollars, or in a combination of both currencies,
Konzum said in a  statement  to the Zagreb stock exchange. Konzum
is the biggest unit among other Agrokor subsidiaries, which will
also provide guarantees for the bond sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
