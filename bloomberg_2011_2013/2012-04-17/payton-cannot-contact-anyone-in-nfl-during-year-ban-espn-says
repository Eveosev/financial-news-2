New Orleans Saints coach  Sean Payton  will be barred from contact with anyone in the  National
Football League  as he serves his one-year suspension for trying
to cover up a program the league says that paid players bonuses
for injuring opponents, according to ESPN.  Should Payton speak with members of the Saints organization
or any of the league’s other 31 teams, he must report it to Ray Anderson, the NFL’s executive vice president of football
operations, ESPN reported today, citing an unidentified person
familiar with the suspension. The 48-year-old coach’s ban began
yesterday and will run until the day after the  Super Bowl  in
February 2013.  NFL Commissioner  Roger Goodell  handed down the stiffest
punishment ever imposed on an NFL team and its leadership on
March 21 after he said Payton lied to the NFL about the program.
The punishment also included a $500,000 fine on the Saints, the
loss of two draft picks, a half-season suspension for General
Manager Mickey Loomis and a six-game ban for assistant Joe Vitt.  The league said at the time of the ruling that it
discovered a program in which Saints players were paid bonuses
from 2009 through 2011 for various on-field accomplishments,
including forced turnovers and injuring opponents. All such
payments violate NFL rules on non-contract bonuses.  Loomis, Payton and Vitt, who was named the team’s interim
coach in Payton’s absence, unsuccessfully appealed their
suspensions this month. Potential punishment for the roughly two
dozen players the league says were involved in the program has
yet to be announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
