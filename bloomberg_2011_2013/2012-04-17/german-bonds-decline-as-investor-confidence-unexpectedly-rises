Spain ’s bonds led gains among the
government securities of  Europe ’s most indebted nations after
the country raised more than its maximum target at a bill sale.  Italian and Portuguese securities also advanced.  Germany ’s
bonds dropped as an industry report showed investor confidence
in Europe’s largest economy unexpectedly improved in April,
damping demand for safer investments. Bunds also fell after
 European consumer prices  rose faster than earlier estimated. The
extra yield investors demand to hold Spanish 10-year bonds
instead of bunds shrank for the first time in three days.  “There may have been some fear out there in the market
that Spain could have had difficulty and that wasn’t the case,”
said  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed market debt at ING Bank
NV in Amsterdam, referring to the Spanish auction. “The bills
got done. The spreads have come in a bit but they are still very
wide.”  Spain’s 10-year bond yield declined 18 basis points, or
0.18 percentage point, to 5.89 percent at 4:31 p.m. London time
after falling as much as 19 basis points, the most since Jan.
27. The 5.85 percent security due in January 2022 rose 1.33, or
13.30 euros per 1,000-euro (1,315) face amount to 99.715.  The spread over bunds shrank 22 basis points to 413 basis
points after expanding to 444 basis points on April 16, the
widest since Nov. 28.  Spain Auction  Spain sold 3.18 billion euros of debt, compared with the
Treasury’s maximum target of 3 billion euros. The country
auctioned 12-month bills at 2.623 percent, up from 1.418 percent
at the previous sale on March 20, the Bank of Spain said in
 Madrid . The Treasury also sold 18-month bills at 3.11 percent,
versus 1.711 percent last month.  Volatility in Spanish securities was the highest among
euro-area debt markets, according to measures of 10-year bonds,
two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps compiled
by Bloomberg.  Italy’s  10-year yield  declined 12 basis points to 5.48
percent, with the spread over German bunds narrowing 15 basis
points to 372 basis points.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield fell 18
basis points to 12.5 percent.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations, which aims
to predict economic developments six months in advance,
increased to 23.4 from 22.3 in March. That’s the highest reading
since June 2010. Economists forecast a drop to 19, according to
a Bloomberg News  survey .  ‘Some Calm’  “We have seen some sour sentiment in the previous days and
now we are seeing some calm” in financial markets, said Niels From, chief analyst at  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  in Copenhagen. “There is
some hope that the German economy is remaining strong.”  Germany’s  10-year bund yield  increased four basis points to
1.76 percent, and the two-year note yield climbed two basis
points to 0.15 percent.  The inflation rate in the 17-nation euro region held at 2.7
percent in March, the European Union’s statistics office said in
an e-mailed statement. That’s higher than the estimate of 2.6
percent published on March 30. The  European Central Bank  aims to
keep annual gains in consumer prices just below 2 percent.  Inflation was “a little higher than expected so that
should prompt market observers to become a little bit more
cautious on prospective easing measures from the ECB,” said
Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische
Landesbank  in Munich. “The ZEW, with an increase, was a little
bit of a surprise to the upside, pressuring bunds.”  German Sale  Germany is scheduled to sell 5 billion euros of two-year
notes tomorrow. Spain plans to auction 2.5 billion euros of
bonds on April 19, and  France  will offer two-, three- and five-
year notes and inflation-linked debt on the same day.  The two-year German yield, which is consolidating near the
April 10 record low of 0.091 percent, will encounter resistance
at its April 12 high of 0.163 percent and its 50-day moving
average currently at 0.213 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  German bonds returned 1.1 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities dropped 2.5
percent, while  Italy ’s gained 8.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
