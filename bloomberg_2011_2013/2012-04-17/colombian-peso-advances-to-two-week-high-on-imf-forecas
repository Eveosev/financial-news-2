Colombia’s peso rose to a two-week
high after the  International Monetary Fund  increased its
forecast for global economic growth, spurring demand for
higher-yielding assets.  The peso climbed 0.4 percent to 1,770 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,776.20 yesterday. Earlier it touched 1,765.80, the strongest
level since April 3. The currency has rallied 9.5 percent this
year, the best performance among all currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  “The market is less adverse to risk today,” said Camilo Contreras, an analyst at Ultrabursatiles SA brokerage in Bogota.
“Foreign investment into Colombia is growing at a tremendous
speed.”  Foreign direct investment jumped 30 percent to
$4.21 billion in the first three months of 2012 from a year
earlier, with 72 percent going into oil and mining, according to
trade-balance  figures  from the central bank. Foreign investment
into stocks and bonds jumped 15 percent to $953 million in the
same period from a year ago.  Yields on benchmark  government bonds  rose today from the
lowest level since they were issued more than three years ago.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 7.11 percent, according to the central bank. It closed
yesterday and April 13 at 7.08 percent, the lowest level since
the securities were issued in March 2009.  Global stocks rose today after the IMF raised its forecast
for global growth in 2012 to 3.5 percent from 3.3 percent and
after  Spain  sold more bills than targeted, easing concern
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis is getting worse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
