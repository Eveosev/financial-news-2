France’s Defense Ministry plans to
award  Thales SA (HO)  a 263 million-euro ($345 million) order to
develop digital radios for military communications.  The radios, which will go into use by 2018, will permit
simultaneous high-security transmission of both voice and data
for use initially in ground vehicles and later on combat planes
and ships, the Paris-based ministry said today in a statement.  Thales, Europe’s biggest military-electronics maker, has
won the “first phase” of the program, and its communications
unit will be notified of the contract in coming days, the
ministry said, without indicating the system’s potential value
over time. French newspaper  Les Echos  has said the project will
be worth as much as 4 billion euros.  A spokeswoman for the ministry referred calls seeking
information to  France ’s military procurement  office , where
nobody was immediately available to respond to questions.
Thales, based in the Paris suburb of  Neuilly-Sur-Seine, also
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
