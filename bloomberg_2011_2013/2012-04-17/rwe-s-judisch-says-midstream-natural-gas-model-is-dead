The old natural-gas midstream model
is “dead” and  RWE AG (RWE)  merged its trading and midstream
businesses to reflect that, Stefan Judisch, chief executive
officer of RWE Supply & Trading GmbH, said at Flame Amsterdam.  “We are in a golden age of gas, but not in Europe,” he
told delegates at the annual gas conference today. “We are in a
golden age of subsidized renewables. Photovoltaic makes sense
economically to consumers, even without subsidies.”  RWE Supply & Trading had a 2011 loss of 800 million euros
($1.05 billion) and said last month it expects its operating
loss to increase this year after rising crude prices boosted the
cost of oil-linked natural-gas costs in 2011.  The Essen-based unit of RWE AG, Germany’s biggest utility,
buys gas in long-term contracts linked to  oil prices  from
suppliers including  Statoil ASA (STL)  and OAO Gazprom, the world’s
biggest producer of the fuel.  “Gas has a security-of-supply problem,” Judisch said
today. “Governments cannot decide when the sun will shine.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
