Enjoy SA (ENJOY) , the Santiago-based casino
owner, may again breach the terms of its bond covenants, Diario
Financiero reported today, citing people it didn’t name.  Enjoy ended last year with debt more than 5 times its
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
The terms of its inflation-linked bonds sold in 2010 indicate
that ratio should have been below 5, the newspaper said.  The company will ask bondholders today to agree that it can
have until the end of the year to bring its ratio of debt to
earnings before items to 4.5, the newspaper said. The holders of
the debt are unlikely to accept the proposal, the newspaper
said, citing bondholders it didn’t name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
