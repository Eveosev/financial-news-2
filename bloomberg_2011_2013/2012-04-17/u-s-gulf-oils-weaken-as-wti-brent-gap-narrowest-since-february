U.S.  Gulf Coast  oil premiums
weakened for a second day as the gap between West Texas
Intermediate and Brent crude narrowed to the smallest margin
since February.  The premium of Brent to WTI, the two global benchmarks, has
been shrinking since Enbridge Inc. and Enterprise Products
Partners LP said they plan to begin oil shipments on the
reversed Seaway pipeline from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to the Gulf
Coast on about May 17.  Brent’s premium over WTI, based on June futures prices,
narrowed $2.09 to $13.22 a barrel at 12:20 p.m. in New York, the
smallest margin since Feb. 29. When Brent decreases versus WTI,
it typically reduces the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that
compete with West African oil priced against the European
benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
decreased $1.30 to $18.10 a barrel at 11:48 a.m.  New York  time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
lost $2 to a premium of $18 a barrel.  Thunder Horse ’s premium narrowed $3.20 to $14.30 a barrel
over WTI, and Mars Blend lost $1.70 to a premium of $10.55.
Poseidon’s premium decreased $1.60 to $9.55, while Southern
Green Canyon’s narrowed $1.50 to $10.  Western Canada Select’s discount narrowed 35 cents to $17 a
barrel. Syncrude’s discount widened 25 cents to $2 a barrel.
Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
