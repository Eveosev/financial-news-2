Homebuilding in the U.S. probably
climbed in March, marking the best quarter since 2008 and
indicating the real-estate industry has steadied, economists
said before a report today.  Housing starts increased to a 705,000 annual rate last
month from a 698,000 pace in February, according to the median
 estimate  of 82 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Starts
probably averaged 703,000 in the first three months of 2012, the
most since the third quarter of 2008.  Warmer weather alongside historically-low lending  costs  and
faster  job creation  may have spurred more  home construction  at
the beginning of 2012. While the number of single-family housing
starts last year was the lowest on record, work on multifamily
units is providing homebuilders with new business.  “Housing starts are starting to see stabilization,” said
 Anika Khan , an economist at  Wells Fargo Securities LLC  in
 Charlotte ,  North Carolina . “The numbers are still coming from a
very low base, but there’s improvement. We’re also still
contending with a lot of the effects from weather.”  The housing starts figures are due from the Commerce
Department at 8:30 a.m. in Washington. Estimates in the
Bloomberg survey ranged from 670,000 to 750,000.  The report may also show building permits slid by 0.7
percent to a 710,000 annual rate, according to the survey
median. In February, the number of applications was at the
highest level since October 2008.  Record Warmth  Record-breaking warm weather probably boosted construction
last month. The average temperature in the U.S. was 51.1 degrees
Fahrenheit (10.6 Celsius), 38.6 degrees warmer than the 20th
century average and the hottest reported March in records going
back to 1895, according to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration .  Even so, low borrowing costs and better job prospects
should support demand for new homes. The average rate on a 30-
year fixed mortgage  reached  an all-time low of 3.87 percent in
February and was just a point higher at 3.88 percent in the week
ended April 12, according to data from  Freddie Mac .  Demand for apartments and condos, buildings that house
multiple families, has also kept construction up. Builders began
work on 241,000 of such units at an annual pace last month, the
second most in more than three years.  Buyers “are starting to feel pressure not to miss this
moment,”  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  Chief Executive Officer Stuart Miller
said during a March 27 conference call with analysts. “The
fully-loaded cost of ownership is lower in the most-desirable
markets than comparable rental rates.”  New-home orders increased 33 percent in the three months
ended Feb. 29, the third-largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue
said. Shares of the Miami-company rose to the highest level
since 2007 after it reported the orders growth and net income
that beat estimates.  Investors also are upbeat about prospects. The  Standard &
Poor’s  Supercomposite  Homebuilding Index (S15HOME)  has advanced 21 percent
since the end of last year, more than the 8.9 percent gain in
the broader  S&P 500 .
