Dewey & LeBoeuf LLP lost eight more
lawyers to Hunton & Williams LLP and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw
Pittman LLP as those firms expand their energy-related
practices.  Bud Ellis, Dewey’s co-head of the utilities, power and
pipelines industry group, heads to Hunton’s  New York  office
along with partners Kevin Felz, Michael Fitzpatrick Jr., Steven
Friend, Steve Loeshelle and  Peter O’Brien , Hunton said today in
a statement. Pillsbury hired Catherine Hood and J. Anthony
Terrell in New York, the firm said in a statement. Dewey
confirmed the departures.  More than 60 partners have departed New York-based Dewey
voluntarily or at the firm’s insistence during what has been
called a restructuring process. The largest contingent to leave
was a group of 12 insurance and regulatory lawyers who went to
Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP last month.  “As we have said in the past, although the new direction
that the firm is taking was approved and is supported by the
overwhelming majority of the firm’s partners, some didn’t like
the change,” Dewey said in an e-mailed statement. “The number
who have left to date, including firm-initiated reductions, is
consistent with the reduced headcount contemplated by our
plan,” the firm said in the statement. Further departures are
expected, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
