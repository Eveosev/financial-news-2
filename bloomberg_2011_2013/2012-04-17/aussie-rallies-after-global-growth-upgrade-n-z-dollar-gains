Australia ’s dollar rose against
most major counterparts as the  International Monetary Fund 
raised its global economic growth outlook, spurring demand for
higher-yielding assets.  New Zealand’s dollar gained versus the greenback and yen as
implied volatility of Group of Seven currencies reached the
lowest level in more than three years. Both South Pacific
nations’ currencies were buoyed as global commodities and stocks
rallied after investor confidence rose in  Germany  and increased
demand at a Spanish bill auction eased concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis is worsening.  The Australian currency rose 0.3 percent to $1.0390
yesterday in  New York . It gained 0.9 percent versus to 84 yen.  New Zealand’s currency was 0.1 percent stronger at 82.10
U.S. cents and rallied 0.6 percent to 66.38 yen.  The MSCI World Index of stocks climbed 1.6 percent, and the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials rose 0.5
percent.  The  implied volatility  of three-month options for Group of
Seven currencies declined 1.3 percent to 9.66 percent, the
lowest level since August 2008, according to the JPMorgan G7
 Volatility Index . The average over the past decade is 10.6
percent. A decrease makes investments in currencies with higher
benchmark rates more attractive because it shows the risk is
greater that market moves will erase profits on such trades.  IMF Outlook  The International Monetary Fund’s World Economic Outlook
forecast the global economy will expand 3.5 percent this year
and 4.1 percent in 2013, an increase from its January
projections of 3.3 percent growth in 2012 and 4 percent next
year.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
said its index of investor and analyst expectations  increased  to
23.4 in April, the highest since June 2010, from 22.3 in March.  Demand for Spanish 12-month bills offered yesterday was 2.9
times the amount sold, compared with 2.14 times last month, Bank
of  Spain  data showed. The bid-to-cover ratio for 18-month notes
was 3.77, compared with 2.93 on March 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
