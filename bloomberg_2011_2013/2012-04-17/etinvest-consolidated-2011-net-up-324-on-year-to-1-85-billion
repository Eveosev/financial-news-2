Metinvest, Ukraine’s biggest
steelmaker, said its profit more than quadrupled last year as it
produced more steel and earned more on  iron ore  sales, while
outlook for this year worsens.  Consolidated net income soared to $1.85 billion, as the
company, controlled by billionaire Rinat Akhmetov, took
advantage of acquisitions to boost output, the Donetsk, Ukraine-
based steelmaker, said today. Crude-steel production rose 64
percent to 14.4 million metric tons, coke-coal rose 12.3 percent
to 11.3 million tons and iron ore totaled 35.7 million tons.
Revenue jumped 52 percent to $14.2 billion.  The takeover of  Mariupolsky Metallurgical Zavod of Ilyich 
in 2010 helped Donetsk-based Metinvest to boost production in
2011, while this year will prove more difficult as  Europe ’s debt
crisis erodes demand. Total steel output for the former Soviet
republic dropped 6.2 percent last month to 2.9 million tons as
global demand declined.  “We expect this year to be more challenging than 2011,”
Chief Financial Officer Sergiy Novikov said in a phone interview
from Donetsk today. “We do not expect the results of 2011 to be
repeated in 2012 because of volatility in global markets.”  The government of Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  expects the
economy’s growth to slow to 3.9 percent this year because of
declining demand for steel, the country’s primary export
product.  Planned Acquisition  Metinvest plans to double its stake in Zaporizhstal
Integrated Iron & Steel Works JSC, in which it bought a 12.5
percent stake last year, Novikov said.  “We are still in the process of negotiations,” he said.
“We do hope that the talks will finish successfully at some
point between now and August,” Novikov said. “Maximum
exposure” will be $180 million to $190 million for an
additional 12.5 percent stake.’’  Iron ore will account for most of Metinvest’s earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, this and next year, Novikov said. Ebitda rose almost 40
percent to $3.56 billion in 2011, the company said.  Iron ore and steel output is going to be on par with last
year, without “any significant changes,” he said.  “We are targeting between 35 million tons and 36 million
tons” of iron ore production this year, he said, adding that
coking coal output will increase “a little” from 11.34 million
tons last year.  Metinvest plans to invest $1.2-$1.3 billion to make its
production more efficient and to improve the quality of steel
divisions, Novikov said. The company will pay shareholders $800
million from its 2011 profit, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
