The State Food and Drug Administration has suspended sales of 13
drugs after media reported the capsules used to hold them
contained excessive levels of chromium, according to a statement
on its website. Tonghua Golden-Horse is among nine drugmakers
whose products have been suspended for inspection, it said.  Qinghai Gelatin Co. (000606)  (000606 CH), a capsule maker, jumped on
speculation a government crackdown on contaminated medicines
will benefit higher-quality suppliers. The stock surged by the
10 percent daily limit for a second day to 6.56 yuan.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
