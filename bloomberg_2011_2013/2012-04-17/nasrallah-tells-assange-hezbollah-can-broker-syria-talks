Hezbollah leader  Hassan Nasrallah 
told Julian Assange, founder of the anti-secrecy website
WikiLeaks, that he’s ready to help broker talks between Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad and his opponents.  “We’ll be more than happy to mediate,” Nasrallah told
Assange today in the first series of a new talk show he’s
hosting on Russian state-run English-language satellite
broadcaster RT, according to an English translation of his
comments in Arabic.  Nasrallah said Lebanon-based Hezbollah, a Shiite Muslim
militant organization backed by  Syria  and designated a terrorist
group by the U.S. and  Israel , had earlier reached out to Syrian
opposition groups and its offer to facilitate dialogue with
Assad was rejected.  Assange is on bail in the U.K. as he fights extradition to
 Sweden  to face rape claims that his supporters blame on U.S.
pressure. He said last week that he expects to be attacked over
his choice of television guests and decision to work with
Russian state media, and insisted he had been given full
editorial independence.  “There’s Julian Assange, enemy combatant traitor, getting
into bed with the Kremlin and interviewing terrible radicals
from around the world,” Assange told RT of the likely criticism
against him. “Those are the people who normally don’t get a
voice, the majority of what they have said to me they could not
say on a mainstream TV network.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
