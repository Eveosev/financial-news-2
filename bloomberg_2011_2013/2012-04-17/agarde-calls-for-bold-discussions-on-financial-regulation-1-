Christine Lagarde , managing
director of the  International Monetary Fund , urged policy makers
to consider “bold” changes to financial regulations that she
said are necessary to ensure world stability and growth.  The global recovery remains fragile after improving in
recent months, with public and private debt levels in Europe too
high and the U.S. held back by  household debt , Lagarde said. She
said regulatory changes that focus on raising capital levels,
rather than cutting back lending, as well as those that reduce
legacy assets, will help economic expansion, she said.  “To help achieve the objectives of growth and stability,
we need a stronger and safer financial sector that puts societal
interest ahead of its own financial gain,” Lagarde said at an
IMF event before this week’s meetings in  Washington . “We need a
more stable financial system, one that serves businesses and
households rather than destabilizes the functioning of the real
economy.”  The IMF today raised its global growth forecast for the
first time in more than a year, with the U.S. boosting the
outlook while recent improvements remain “very fragile.”  “It’s fair to say that things are looking a bit better
than they did even a few months ago,” Lagarde said. “We can
see some signs of thaw -- welcome signs after the longest,
hardest, winter in a generation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
