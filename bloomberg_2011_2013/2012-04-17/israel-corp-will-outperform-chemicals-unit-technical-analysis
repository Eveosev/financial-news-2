Israel Corp. (ILCO)  is poised to start
beating  Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  after lagging behind its unit this
year as the ratio between the two stocks reached a technical
barrier, according to Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd.  Israel Chemicals, which extracts minerals from the  Dead Sea 
to make fertilizers, gained 7.4 percent this year, as Israel
Corp., which has a 52 percent stake in the chemicals company,
rose 1.8 percent. A ratio measuring the stocks’ trading patterns
has reached its lower Bollinger band, indicating that Israel
Corp.’s gains will start to exceed those of its unit, said
Daniel Rapoport, the head of equities and derivatives at Bank
Leumi.  “Whenever such a wide discrepancy like this occurs it
signals an opportunity,” Rapoport said by phone from  Tel Aviv 
yesterday. Investors should buy shares of Israel Corp. and sell
Israel Chemical’s stock, he said.  The ratio between the two stocks fell to the lower
Bollinger band of 56.4 percent yesterday, according to Leumi.
After the spread dropped below that level on Feb. 29, Israel
Corp. climbed 10 percent in the following month, while Israel
Chemicals advanced 5 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bollinger bands are designed to alert investors when a
security rises too high or falls too low by comparing its price
to average trading levels.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
