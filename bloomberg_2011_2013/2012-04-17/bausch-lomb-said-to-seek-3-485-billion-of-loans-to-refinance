Bausch & Lomb Inc., the eye-care
products maker owned by  Warburg Pincus  LLC, is seeking $3.485
billion in loans to refinance debt and back its acquisition of
 Ista Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ISTA) , according to a person with knowledge
of the transaction.  The financing will include a $2.035 billion term loan B, a
$600 million term piece B which will be available to European
investors, a $350 million delayed-draw term portion and a $500
million revolving line of credit, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the terms are private.  The term loans will be covenant-lite, meaning they won’t
have financial maintenance requirements.  Citigroup Inc. is arranging the financing for the
Rochester, New York-based company and will host a lender meeting
April 19 at 10 a.m. in  New York , the person said.  The company’s existing term loan B due April 2015 was
quoted at 100.25 cents on the dollar today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The debt pays interest at 3.25 percentage
points more than the London interbank offered rate, the data
show.  The loans will provide the company with financial
flexibility for future growth opportunities, Adam Grossberg, a
spokesman for Bausch & Lomb, said in an e-mailed statement.  Bausch & Lomb agreed to acquire Irvine, California-based
Ista Pharmaceuticals in a deal valued at $500 million, according
to a March 26 statement. The cash offer of $9.10 a share is 10
percent higher than Ista’s closing price on March 23.  Warburg Pincus, the New York-based private-equity firm with
$30 billion in assets under management, acquired Bausch & Lomb
for $3.96 billion in October 2007, Bloomberg data show.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan  it can’t. So-called B loans are
mainly bought by non-bank lenders such as collateralized loan
obligations, mutual funds and  hedge funds .  To contact the reporter on this story:
