Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc. (MSO)  was sued by a shareholder over a proposed increase in the
number of shares in a stock option plan.  Investor Helene Hutt filed the lawsuit today in New York
State Supreme Court in  Manhattan , accusing the New York-based
company and its directors of violating their fiduciary duties of
“care, loyalty and good faith” and putting their personal
interests ahead of those of stockholders.  The company in a regulatory filing earlier this month
recommended that investors at its May 23 annual meeting approve
a proposed amendment to its omnibus stock and option
compensation option plan that would increase the number of
shares reserved for issuance by 4.6 million, Hutt said in the
complaint.  Hutt, who is seeking class-action status on behalf of other
shareholders, is requesting unspecified damages and asking the
court to stop the company from putting the proposal to a vote.  Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for  Martha Stewart  Living,
declined to comment on the complaint, saying the company hasn’t
reviewed it yet.  The case is Hutt v. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.,
651249/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
