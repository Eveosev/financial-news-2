Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s  Alan Mulally  says
the carmaker’s goal to more than double deliveries of electric-
drive autos won’t stall should initial sales of the new battery-
powered Focus hatchback start at a slower-than-planned pace.  The Dearborn, Michigan-based company this month is selling
the $39,200 electric Focus that averages 76 miles (122
kilometers) per charge, without providing a volume target.
 Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Leaf hatchback, with a $35,200 base price and
averaging 73 miles per charge, sold 9,674 units in its first
full year.  Even selling fewer than 5,000 Focus EVs in the first year
wouldn’t be a failure, Mulally, Ford’s chief executive officer,
told reporters yesterday in Laguna Niguel, California.  “No, because we believe that the electrification of
vehicles is going to continue as the battery cost comes down, as
we move to generate electricity cleanly,” Mulally said at a
conference hosted by Fortune magazine. “We see this as
continually growing. This is a long-term journey.”  The average price of lithium-ion battery packs for electric
vehicles fell 14 percent in the past year as production capacity
exceeded demand, Bloomberg New Energy Finance said. Batteries
cost $689 a kilowatt-hour in the first quarter of 2012, compared
with $800 a year earlier, the London-based research company said
today in a statement.  Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, is competing in a
nascent market for vehicles powered wholly or in part by
electricity that includes Nissan, General Motors Co., Toyota
Motor Corp.,  Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)  and startups  Tesla Motors
Inc. (TSLA)  and closely held Fisker Automotive Inc.  Sales Surge  Ford expects hybrids, plug-in hybrids, which travel short
distances on electric power before an engine engages, and all-
electric cars to account for as much as 25 percent of its new
vehicle sales by 2020. Of that figure, conventional hybrids will
account for the biggest share of sales, Mulally said.  Electric-drive vehicles were the fastest-growing segment in
the U.S. auto market in the first quarter, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales of those models rose 49 percent to
117,182 vehicles in the first quarter, from 78,527 a year
earlier before Japan’s earthquake and tsunami pinched output.  Electric cars and hybrids are surging in tandem with
regular unleaded gasoline prices, which averaged $3.90 a gallon
on April 16, approaching the July 2008 peak of $4.11, according
to AAA.  Toyota (7203) ’s Prius hybrid and  GM (GM) ’s Chevrolet Volt plug-in
hybrid electric car each had record sales in March. Nissan Chief
Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  repeated this month in  New York 
he’s “bullish” that pure electric cars will capture 10 percent
of the market by 2020.  Electrified vehicles secured 3.4 percent of the U.S. light-
vehicle market in this year’s first quarter, up from 2.6 percent
a year earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Hybrids
fell to 2.2 percent of the U.S. market last year, down from 2.4
percent in 2010, after peaking at 2.8 percent in 2009, according
to LMC Automotive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
