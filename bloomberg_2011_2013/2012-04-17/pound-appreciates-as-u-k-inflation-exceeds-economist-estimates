The pound extended its advance
against the euro and the dollar after the  Office for National
Statistics  said U.K. inflation accelerated in March for the
first time in six months.  Britainâ€™s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 82.39 pence
per euro at 9:36 a.m. London time. It traded 0.3 percent higher
at $1.5945.  U.K.  consumer prices  rose 3.5 percent from a year earlier,
up from a 3.4 percent increase in February. Economists surveyed
