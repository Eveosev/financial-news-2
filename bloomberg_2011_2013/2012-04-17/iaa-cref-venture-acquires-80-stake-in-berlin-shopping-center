TIAA-CREF, the manager of
retirement accounts for employees of nonprofit institutions,
acquired an 80 percent interest in the Berlin shopping center
Gropius Passagen through a joint venture.  The stake in the 1 million square-foot (93,200-square-
meter) property, which has 150 stores and 2,000 parking spaces,
was bought in conjunction with German real estate company Mfi
Management fur Immobilien AG for an undisclosed price,  New York- 
based TIAA-CREF said in a statement today.  “Gropius Passagen reflects TIAA-CREF’s ongoing strategy to
develop a diversified real estate portfolio, including high-
quality dominant shopping centers in markets benefiting from
strong catchment areas,” Aymeric Thibord, director of real
estate investment at TIAA-CREF Asset Management U.K. Ltd., said
in the statement.  The deal is TIAA-CREF’s second partnership with Mfi
Management after jointly developing the Erlangen Arcaden
shopping center, a 323,000-square-foot mall with 100 stores that
opened in 2007. It also follows TIAA-CREF’s acquisition of the
Pep Shopping Center in Munich last year.  TIAA-CREF owned offices, retail and industrial properties
valued at more than $18 billion in the U.S., Canada and western
 Europe  as of Dec. 31, according to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
