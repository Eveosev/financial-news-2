Pennsylvania sold $950 million of
general-obligation bonds today, its largest tax-exempt offering
since 2006, with yields at the lowest it has ever achieved.  Goldman Sachs & Co. (GS)  won bidding for the deal, the state and
the bank said. A bond maturing in June 2022 was priced to yield
2.16 percent, while similarly rated debt was  yielding  2.41
percent yesterday, according to a Bloomberg Fair Market index.  The average cost of the offering, with a final maturity in
2032, was 3.01 percent, the lowest rate the state has ever
received on general-obligation debt, said Eric Shirk, a
spokesman for Governor Tom Corbett, a Republican. An index of
top-rated 10-year munis  yielded  2.14 percent yesterday.  “We are very pleased with where we priced,” Shirk said by
e-mail. “It speaks volumes to the strength of the
commonwealth’s credit.”  Securities maturing in June 2032 were priced at the highest
yield, 3.63 percent, yet that was 18 basis points lower than the
Fair Market index for AA+ rated debt, at 3.81 percent yesterday.
Moody’s Investors Service rated the bonds a similar Aa1, its
second-highest grade.  Standard & Poor’s  rated the Pennsylvania
deal AA, one step lower than AA+. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Pennsylvania plans to use the proceeds to cover expenses
tied to three state prisons, a judicial center in Philadelphia,
environmental projects and fixing bridges, according to Shirk.  To contact the reporters on this story:
