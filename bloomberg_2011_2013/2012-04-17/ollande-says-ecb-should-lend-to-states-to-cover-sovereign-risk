French Socialist candidate  Francois Hollande , the frontrunner in presidential elections, said the
 European Central Bank  should lend directly to member states to
help them cover their risk and secure their sovereign debt.  Speaking at a meeting in Lille, five days before the first
round of the elections, Hollande called on the ECB to expand
its actions beyond lending to banks.  On March 19, Hollande said he wanted the ECBâ€™s mandate to
include spurring economic growth as well as maintaining price
stability, a measure his rival, incumbent President Nicolas
Sarkozy, also proposed in an April 15 speech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
