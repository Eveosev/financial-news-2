The European Union tapped the bond
markets for the third time this year with a sale of 26-year
securities to help fund the bailout of  Portugal .  The European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism is raising
1.8 billion euros ($2.3 billion) of notes priced to yield 87
basis points, or 0.87 percentage point, more than the swap rate,
according to a statement from Amadeu Altafaj, a Brussels-based
spokesman at the European Commission, the executive arm of the
EU.  The offering is the first since the EFSM raised 3 billion
euros from 20-year notes on Feb. 24, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The AAA rated bailout fund, operated by the
European Commission and backed by the EU’s member states, has
raised 34 billion euros from bond markets since January 2011 to
help fund the rescues of Portugal and Ireland.  “The good demand and quick execution of such a long
maturity indicates that confidence is returning,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of euro-area rate strategy at Societe Generale SA
in Paris. “The success of the EU’s deal will help reopen the
market for other issuers.”  The yield premium on EFSM’s 3.375 percent bonds due 2032
has narrowed to 64 basis points more than the swap rate from an
issue spread of 78 basis points, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices.  Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, DZ Bank AG and HSBC Plc are
managing the new issue, said the banker, who declined to be
identified because the information is private.  To contact the reporter on this story:
