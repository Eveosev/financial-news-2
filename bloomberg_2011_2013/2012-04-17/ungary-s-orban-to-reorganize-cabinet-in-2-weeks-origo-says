Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  will reorganize his government within two weeks and
replace two Cabinet ministers, news website  Origo  said, citing
several unidentified people from the ruling Fidesz party.  Tamas Fellegi, the minister without portfolio in charge of
bailout negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and
the European Union, will be replaced by  Mihaly Varga , Orban’s
chief of staff, from the end of April, according to Origo.  Zoltan Balog, the state secretary at the Justice Ministry,
will be promoted to minister in charge of education, culture and
national resources, succeeding Miklos Rethelyi, the news portal
said. Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  will retain his post.  The timing of the changes hinge on the start of bailout
talks and the government expects “progress” in the stalled
negotiations next week, according to Origo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
