German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler, who’s also the leader of the Free Democratic Party,
expects enough votes from the ruling parties to approve
expansion of the European Financial Stability Facility without
help from opposition lawmakers,  Bild Zeitung  reported, citing an
interview.  The number of FDP members opposing the rescue fund has
declined, the newspaper reported.  Germany  needs a stable euro to
support exports and protect jobs, Roesler told Bild.  To contact the reporter on this story:
