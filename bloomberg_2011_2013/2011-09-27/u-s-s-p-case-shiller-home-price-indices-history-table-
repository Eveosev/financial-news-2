The following table shows the historical
price change according to the S&P/Case-Shiller home price indices. Cities
are ranked by largest monthly gain using non seasonally adjusted data.  The composition of the U.S. metropolitan area captured by each of the
S&P/Case-Shiller(R) Home Price Indices (SPCSIs) is largely based upon the
most recent definitions established by the Office of Management and Budget
in 2003. With the exceptions of  Chicago  (as composed for the S&P/Case-Shiller
Home Price Index, akin to the OMB Chicago “Metropolitan Division”) and  New
York  (as composed for the S&P/Case-Shiller New York Home Price Index, a
variant of the OMB New York “Combined Statistical Area”), these markets are
consistent with what OMB refers to as the “Metropolitan Statistical Area”
(MSA) of each city listed.  For more information on geographic composition
of the SPCSIs, please see
