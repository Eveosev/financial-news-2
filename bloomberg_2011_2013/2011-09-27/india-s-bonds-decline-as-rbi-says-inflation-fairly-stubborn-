India ’s 10-year bonds dropped for a
second day after  Reserve Bank  of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
said inflation has been “fairly stubborn” and remains above
the central bank’s comfort level.  A rate of “4 to 6 percent is the short-term comfort
range” for inflation, Subbarao said yesterday in remarks at New
York University’s Stern School of Business. India’s benchmark
wholesale-price inflation accelerated to a 13-month high of 9.78
percent in August. The central bank has boosted borrowing costs
six times this year, lifting the repurchase rate to 8.25
percent.  “Inflation concern still persists,” said Krishnamurthy Harihar, treasurer at FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. “There still
remains a strong possibility of another rate hike.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent securities due April 2021 rose
one basis point to 8.32 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose 7 basis points to 7.82 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
