Russia  will reduce its export duty
on most crude shipments by 7.4 percent on Oct. 1 after Prime
Minister  Vladimir Putin  approved a tax measure to spur
production and oil prices fell.  The standard duty will drop to $411.40 a metric ton ($56.12
a barrel), according an order signed by Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin and published in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the state newspaper
today. The duty is calculated using a tax rate of 60 percent,
down from the 65 percent applied previously. This month, oil
exports are taxed at $444.10 a ton.  The discounted rate on some Eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea oil will fall to $204.50 from $205.10 this month.  Russia bases its export duties on the average Urals price
from the 15th day of one month to the 14th day of the next.
Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $112.26 during
the most recent monitoring period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said on Sept. 15.  The government is setting the 60 percent rate “by hand”
each month before a tax amendment is passed into law, Sakovich
said in August. Putin last month signed an order unifying the
refined product duty at 66 percent of the crude levy.  Exports of refined products will taxed at $271.50 a ton
next month, according to the order. That will cut the duty on
middle distillates such as diesel by 8.7 percent, while raising
the rate for heavy products like  fuel oil  by 31 percent.  A special gasoline tax that Putin imposed starting May 1 to
fight domestic shortages may fall to $370.20 a ton. That is 90
percent of the crude duty.  Liquefied petroleum gases, such as propane and butane, will
be taxed at $196.60 a ton, according to the order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
