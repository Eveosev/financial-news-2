Activist investing is detrimental
to the economy because it doesn’t encourage a long-term view,
said Martin Lipton, founding partner at  New York  law firm
Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz.  “With activism, we are not doing the long-term
investments, the long-term planning to collectively grow
companies and the economy,” Lipton said today at the Bloomberg
Dealmakers Summit in New York. Lipton participated in a panel on
activist investors with Barry Rosenstein, managing partner at
Jana Partners LLC.  For example, Carl Icahn’s investment in  Clorox Co. (CLX)  hasn’t
been beneficial to shareholders, Lipton said. Clorox declined
the most in more than a month yesterday after Icahn withdrew a
slate of directors for the company and said shareholders
wouldn’t support his plan for a sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
