Emirates NBD Asset Management Ltd.,
a unit of the United Arab Emirates’ biggest bank by assets, has
tied up with London-based hedge  fund manager   Man Group Plc (EMG)  to
manage money of its Islamic alternative assets fund.  The Dubai-based fund manager will allocate assets of its
Emirates Islamic Alternative Strategies Fund, set up in 2007, to
the Man GLG Multi-Strategy Fund, Deon Vernooy, Emirates NBD
Asset Management’s senior executive officer, said at a news
conference in Dubai today. Man Group is the world’s biggest
hedge fund manager.  The Emirates Islamic Alternative Strategies Fund manages
$20.9 million and “if we don’t raise $50 million to $100
million in a year we would be disappointed,” Vernooy said. The
fund will seek annual returns of 3 percent to 5 percent over the
London interbank offered rate, he said.  The Man GLG Multi-Strategy Fund Index has grown at a
compound annual rate of 4.75 percent since 2002 versus a 2.37
percent growth of the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index, according to
a statement from Emirates NBD Asset Management. The Dubai-based
fund company, a unit of  Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , manages about 4.5
billion dirhams ($1.23 billion) across 14 funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
