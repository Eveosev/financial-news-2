The Bank of New York Mellon  China 
ADR Index, which tracks American depositary receipts, gained 2.8

shares in New York trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses and

carrier by subscribers, rose 1.6 percent, the most in almost two
weeks, to $49.97. The company, flush with more than $50 billion
in cash, doesn’t have any targets for potential acquisitions,
Chairman  Wang Jianzhou  said in an interview in Dalian, China.
The company’s cash is better spent on network upgrades at home,
he said.  China New Borun Corp. (BORN)  , which produces corn-based
edible alcohol in China, rose 8.7 percent to $4.01, the highest
since Sept. 1. The company’s three business projects for crude
corn oil, liquid carbon dioxide and edible alcohol production
were completed and put into service, it said in a statement
today distributed by PR Newswire.  Renren Inc. (RENN US), the Chinese social-networking site
that completed an $855 million initial public offering in May,
climbed 4.5 percent to $5.59, the highest in a week. The company
will buy online video-sharing site 56.com for $80 million in
cash, it said in a statement today. The acquisition will be
completed in the fourth quarter, the statement said. The price
is “reasonable,” and Renren won’t “try to do too many”
deals, focusing instead on integrating 56.com, Chief Executive
Officer Joe Chen said in a phone interview today.  Youku.com Inc. (YOKU)  , owner of China’s biggest online-
video site, surged 7.3 percent to $20.27, the highest since
Sept. 15.  Sina Corp. (SINA US), owner of China’s third-most popular
website, soared 5.8 percent to $87.13.  Baidu Inc. (BIDU US), China’s biggest Internet company by
market value, added 4.2 percent, the most in a month, to
$127.72.  NetEase.com (NTES)  Inc, the second-biggest online games
operator, jumped 5.5 percent, the biggest gain in more than a
month, to $41.40.  Xueda Education Group (XUE)  , a Chinese provider of
tutoring services for primary and secondary school students,
sank 10 percent to a record low of $3.16. The company cut its
forecast for revenue this year, citing a revised compensation
structure for its education consultants. The company also said
it plans to buy back as much as $30 million of its American
depositary receipts through open-market transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
