The ruble strengthened for the
first day in seven versus the dollar, adding 0.7 percent to
32.19 as of 10:12 a.m. in Moscow.  The Russian currency was little changed against the euro at
43.65, leaving it 0.4 percent stronger versus the central bank’s
dollar-euro basket at 37.3553, snapping a 12-day losing streak.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, rose 2.6 percent to
$82.36 a barrel in  New York . U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  predicted that European governments will use more force
to resolve the region’s crisis after they heard the concerns of
global finance officials during meetings in Washington last
weekend.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
