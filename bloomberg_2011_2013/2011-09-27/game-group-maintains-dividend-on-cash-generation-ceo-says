Game Group Plc (GMG)  maintained its
dividend because “this is still a very cash-generative
business,” Chief Executive Officer Ian Shepherd said.  Analysts including Nick Batram and  John Stevenson  of Peel
Hunt had been predicting Game would reduce its dividend to
conserve cash. First-half sales were 558.8 million pounds,
compared with an analysts’ consensus estimate of 568.5 million
pounds.  Game Group anticipates “low, single-digit positive” sales
increase at stores open at least a year for the rest of the
fiscal year, allowing it to make its full-year estimates of
unchanged or a drop of three percent same-store sales, Shepherd
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
