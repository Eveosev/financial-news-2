Codexis Inc. (CDXS)  , the U.S.
biotechnology developer, is collaborating with  Brazil ’s largest
ethanol producer to create strains of yeast that may boost the
output of plants that turn sugar cane into fuel.  The companies are planning a pilot project at Raizen
Energia SA’s Bonfim mill in Sao Paulo state, Redwood City-based
Codexis said today in a statement.  The goal is to increase the amount of ethanol that can be
produced from sugar cane, and Codexis plans to sell the
technology at the end of 2012 to other companies in Brazil,
where there are more than 300 mills, Codexis’s Chief Executive
Officer Alan Shaw said today in an interview.  “If we improve yields in the low-single digits, we could
make hundreds of millions of dollars here,” he said.  Raizen, a joint venture of Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Cosan
SA Industria & Comercio, is Codexis’s biggest shareholder with a
16 percent stake, Shaw said.  The cane processor made 600 million gallons (2.3 billion
liters) of ethanol in 2010, about 8.6 percent of Brazil’s total
production, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
