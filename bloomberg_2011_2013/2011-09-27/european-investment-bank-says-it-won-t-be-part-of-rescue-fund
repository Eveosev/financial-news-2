The  European Investment Bank  said
it doesn’t expect to be linked to the European Financial
Stability Facility, the euro area’s main crisis rescue fund.  The bank won’t be used as part of a special purpose vehicle
in connection with the rescue fund, the EIB said in a statement
today on its website. The Luxembourg-based European Investment
Bank is the European Union’s arm for financing investment
projects like energy and road networks.  “The EIB has not been approached and has no plans to be
involved in this,” the statement said. “The EIB will continue
to focus on its mission which is financing viable investment
projects.”  European officials including French Finance Minister
 Francois Baroin  and EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn 
have said governments are looking at ways to leverage the
region’s bailout program. They have not specified what mechanism
might be used to provide that leverage, saying only that the
goal would be to erect a “firewall” around the sovereign debt
crisis once a revamp of the fund is completed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
