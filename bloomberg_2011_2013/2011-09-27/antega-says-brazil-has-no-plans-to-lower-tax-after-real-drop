Brazil’s Finance Minister  Guido
Mantega  said the government has no plans to lower financial
transaction taxes after the real weakened 12 percent this month.  Mantega, speaking to reporters in Brasilia, said he doesn’t
see an imminent risk of  Greece  defaulting on its debt.  Brazil raised the so-called IOF tax on capital inflows in
October and later levided a tax on currency derivatives in a bid
to stem a 47 percent rally in the real since the end of 2008
through August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
