Kuwait  National Petroleum Co., the
state-run refiner, is seeking foreign companies to work as
consultants on a planned 4 billion-dinar ($14.4 billion)  oil
refinery , a KNPC spokesman said.  “We started the exercise to sense their ability and
availability as PMCs,” or project management consultants,
Mohammed al-Ajmi said today by phone from Kuwait. “The project
is moving ahead, but we are waiting for the final approval
letter from the Supreme Petroleum Council.”  The council, Kuwait’s highest decision-making body for oil
policy, approved in June the construction of the delayed 615,000
barrel-a-day Al-Zour facility, Oil Minister Mohammad al-Busairy
said in a June 28 interview.  The companies KNPC has approached include  Fluor Corp. (FLR)  of
Irving,  Texas ,  Technip SA (TEC)  and U.K.-based  Amec Plc (AMEC) , al-Ajmi said.  The Al-Zour project was stalled more than two years ago
amid political opposition after Kuwait awarded construction
contracts for the refinery in May 2008 to  JGC Corp. (1963)  of  Japan  and
South Korea’s  GS Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360) , SK
Engineering & Construction Co., Daelim Industrial Co. and
Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. Fluor won a consulting
contract. The initial plan called for the refinery to start
operating by 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
