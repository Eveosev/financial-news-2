Philippine authorities suspended
trading in the stock, bond and currency markets today as Typhoon
Nesat made landfall in the Southeast Asian nation, shutting
schools and government offices.  Trading at the Philippine Stock Exchange is halted today
due to inclement weather and “lack of clearing facilities,”
its President Hans Sicat said in a memorandum posted on the
bourse’s website today.  Government bonds  and  currency trading  is
suspended, central bank Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said in
a mobile-phone text message.  The eye of the storm, locally known as Pedring, was at 40
kilometers east of Aurora, a province east of the capital, at 4
a.m. local time today, with maximum winds of 140 kilometers per
hour and gusts of up to 170 kilometers per hour, the Philippine
Atmospheric, Geophysical & Astronomical Services Administration
said on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
