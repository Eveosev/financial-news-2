advance since April 2009, amid optimism that European leaders
may agree on ways to tame the region’s credit crisis.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s No. 1 lender by market value,
gained 3.6 percent in  Hong Kong  after a report the  European

a dead cat bounce.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 4 percent to 113.42 as
