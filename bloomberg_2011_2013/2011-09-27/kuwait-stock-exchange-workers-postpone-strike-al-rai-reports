Kuwait Stock Exchange employees
suspended for three weeks a strike planned for tomorrow,  Al-Rai 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Workers at the exchange received assurances from Commerce
Minister Amani Boresli that she will resolve their problems in
accordance with an article in the law, the news service said.  The employees were planning to cease work to protest
against a decision by Boresli affecting wages and employment
benefits, according to Al-Rai. A decision on the employeesâ€™
salaries and benefits associated with their transfer to the
 Capital Markets Authority  was taken by the authority, while
Boresli has refused to hold a stock market committee meeting to
decide on the issue, Al-Rai said.  Kuwait Stock Exchange is holding talks with employees to
avert the planned Sept. 28 strike, Hamed al-Saif, the director
and head of the exchange, said today in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
