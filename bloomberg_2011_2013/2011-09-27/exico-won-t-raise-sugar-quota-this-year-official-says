Mexico , the world’s sixth-largest
sugar producer, doesn’t plan to increase its sugar-import quota
again this year as domestic buyers switch to lower-cost corn
syrup, said a government committee official.  The committee known as Conadesuca doesn’t see a need to
proceed with another sugar-import quota, said the person today
in a telephone interview from Mexico City. The 150,000-ton quota
that was being considered shouldn’t be approved or published in
the nation’s official gazette, the official said. Conadesuca
recommends sugar-import policies for Mexico.  In May, Mexico approved a quota of 150,000 tons to cover a
possible sugar shortfall and stabilize prices amid record level
exports to the U.S. arranged the prior year. Last month, the
 Economy Ministry  said it may authorize a second import quota for
the same amount for the start of the 2011-2012 season.  Mexico’s sugar chamber doesn’t expect more imports this
year as the pace of exports has slowed, Juan Cortina, the trade
group president said in a Sept. 21 interview.  Mexico, a net exporter of sugar, regulates the industry of
the sweetener by setting import quotas.  In August, there was surplus of sugar in Mexico of 1.2
million tons, according to a  preliminary report  by Conadesuca.  Sugar inventories are enough to cover any domestic demand
until November, the official said. By then, Mexico will have the
first results of its new sugar season, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
