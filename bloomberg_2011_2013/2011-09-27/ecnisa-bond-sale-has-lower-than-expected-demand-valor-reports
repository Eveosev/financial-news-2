Tecnisa SA (TCSA3)  had about 200 million
reais ($109.6 million) of investor demand for its sale of bonds
in the Brazilian market, below the 300 million reais the company
planned to raise, Valor Economico reported, without saying where
it obtained the information.  Banks managing the sale will buy at least 50 million reais
of bond not sold to investors in the offering, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
