Solyndra LLC, the bankrupt solar-
panel maker, won court permission to hold an auction for a plant
that was financed partly with more than $500 million in loans
guaranteed by the U.S. government.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath in Wilmington,  Delaware ,
today approved an Oct. 27 auction of Solyndra’s assets,
rejecting a request from lower-ranking creditors for more time
to seek potential buyers.  The U.S. Department of Energy, which provided a $535
million loan guarantee to the company, opposed any delay, saying
an effort to reorganize the company before the bankruptcy
failed.  “That attempt at restructuring has already occurred,”
Matthew Troy, a lawyer with the U.S. Justice Department, said in
court today. “We are where we are, and all the parties have to
deal with it.”  The company, whose federal loan guarantee is being
investigated by Republicans in Congress, filed for bankruptcy
this month with a plan to either sell its eight-month-old
factory or liquidate the specialized equipment used to
manufacture its solar panels.  The case is In re Solyndra LLC 11-12799,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
