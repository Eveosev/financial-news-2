Standard & Poor’s  reiterated its
forecast for a 10 percent decline in  China ’s property prices
this year, citing the credit outlook and estimates for sales
declines, Bei Fu, an analyst at the credit rating company, said
on a conference call.   The outlook for the real estate sector in China remains
“negative,” she said. Most developers rated by S&P don’t rely
on trust companies’ loans, she added, citing increasing concerns
that real estate companies are increasing their exposure to such
financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
