Switzerland ’s economy may expand at
a slower pace than previously forecast as the franc’s
appreciation and faltering global demand hurt exports, the KOF
Economic Institute said.  Swiss gross domestic product will probably rise 2.3 this
year and 1.5 percent in 2012, the Zurich-based institute said in
an e-mailed statement today. It had previously forecast the
economy to expand 2.8 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. In
2013, the economy may grow 2.5 percent, it said.  The Swiss government also lowered its growth estimates
earlier this month and forecast some “isolated quarters” of
contraction. With the franc reaching an all-time high against
the euro last month, the  Swiss National Bank  on Sept. 6 was
forced to impose a currency ceiling of 1.20. Still, the central
bank has said that growth may come to a halt in the second half.  “The franc continues to be overvalued,” KOF said. “The
intervention by the SNB did lower the exchange-rate risks.
Nevertheless, for many companies, the current exchange rate will
be difficult to bring in line with their production costs.”  The franc was little changed after the report, trading at
1.2203 versus the euro at 11:46 a.m. in Zurich. It reached a
record of 1.0075 against the single currency on Aug. 9.  ‘Steeper’ Slowdown  Swiss exports may rise 3.9 percent this year and 2.3
percent in 2012, KOF said.  Consumer spending  will increase 1.3
percent and 1.4 percent in 2011 and 2012, while inflation is
seen averaging 0.5 percent this year and 0.7 percent in 2012,
today’s report showed. The SNB on Sept. 15 forecast consumer
prices to drop on an annual basis next year.  Logitech International SA (LOGN) , the world’s largest maker of
computer mice based in Romanel-sur-Morges, Switzerland, on Sept.
22 cut profit estimates for a second time in two months, saying
“the situation has worsened” in  Europe  and the U.S. Swiss
chemicals maker  Clariant AG (CLN)  earlier this month lowered its full-
year earnings targets partly on the stronger franc.  KOF said the SNB’s currency cap “did prevent an even
steeper” economic slowdown.  “Overcoming the high value of the franc must also be
considered a source of uncertainty,” KOF said. “Cessation of
production can no longer be excluded, or at least a greater
trend toward moving production abroad than forecast.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
