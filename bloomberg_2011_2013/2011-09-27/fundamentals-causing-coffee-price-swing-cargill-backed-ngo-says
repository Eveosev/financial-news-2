The recent price swings in global
coffee markets are being caused by fundamentals, according to
U.S. non-profit organization TechnoServe.  Arabica coffee prices have fallen 21 percent since climbing
to a 14-year high on May 3.  Global coffee demand continues to outpace supplies and
inventories are historically low, David Browning, a director at
the organization said at the first meeting of the Consultative
Forum on Coffee Sector Finance at the London-based International
Coffee Organization in  London  today.  Investors may exacerbate volatility, although the moves are
primarily caused by fundamentals, he said.  Cargill Inc., Coca-Cola, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Olam
International are corporate partners of the non-governmental
organization, according to TechnoServeâ€™s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
