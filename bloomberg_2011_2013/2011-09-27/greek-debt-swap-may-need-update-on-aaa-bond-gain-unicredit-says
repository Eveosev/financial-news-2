Greece ’s proposed voluntary swap of
government debt securities, part of a European financing package
for the country, may need amending after AAA rated bonds surged,
according to UniCredit SpA.  “There are still a lot of unresolved issues out there
which may force some revisions,”  Erik Nielsen , the bank’s
London-based global chief economist, wrote in an investor note
yesterday. “With the rally in the price of collateral, who’ll
carry that cost? This is an issue, but I very much doubt that
revisions here” will be a “game changer,” he wrote.  An index representing the yield of AAA rated euro-region
debt dropped to 2.25 percent yesterday from 3.21 percent on July
21, when banks pledged to participate in the bond exchange and
debt-buyback program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
