Iraq ’s parliament may pass a new
energy law by the end of this year, hoping to make it easier for
the government to attract foreign investors, the chairman of the
legislative body’s oil and energy committee said.  “We are studying two drafts, one from within the committee
and another one from the government,” Adnan Al Janabi said.
“We will come out with a new law from these two drafts, and we
can pass the law by the end of the year.” He spoke today in an
interview at the Iraq 2011: Future Energy conference organized
by The Energy Exchange in Istanbul.  Passage of the law would end five years of delay due to
political wrangling and help the government secure investment in
oil and natural-gas projects. Iraq has the fifth-biggest gas
reserves in the  Middle East  and the world’s fifth-largest crude
oil deposits, according to data from BP Plc. It relies on sales
of crude for most of its revenue, which it needs to rebuild its
economy after decades of war and sanctions.  Iraq’s cabinet approved a draft energy law on Aug. 28. Al
Janabi’s committee rejected the draft because it was incomplete
and had numerous “shortcomings,” Qassim Mohammed Qassim, a
lawmaker, said on Sept. 7. Passage of the law may resolve
differences between the central government and the semi-
autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government over the sharing of
revenue from oil produced at Kurdish fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
