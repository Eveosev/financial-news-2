U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commissioner Elisse Walter said she doesn’t anticipate the
agency will recommend repealing the Tower Amendment governing
disclosure in municipal securities sales.  Walter, speaking at a Sifma  conference  in  New York City ,
said the SEC is in the process of drafting a report that will
recommend ways to improve disclosure in the $2.9 trillion
municipal  bond market .  The 1975 Tower Amendment to federal securities regulation
prohibits the SEC from requiring state and local issuers to file
disclosure documents with the agency when they sell debt. The
responsibility lies with underwriters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
