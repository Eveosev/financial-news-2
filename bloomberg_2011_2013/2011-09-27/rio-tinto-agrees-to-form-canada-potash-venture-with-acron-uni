Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
second-largest mining company, agreed to form a joint venture
with OAO Acron’s  North Atlantic Potash Inc.  unit to explore for
the fertilizer ingredient in Canada.  The venture will focus on nine areas in Saskatchewan
province, where Acron already holds licenses, the Russian
company said today in a statement. The partners may build mines
in the region, it said.  Potash producers are consolidating as rising demand for
crop nutrients drives up prices, prompting investment in new
exploration and production. The Canadian deal gives Rio access
to the world’s richest potash province, while Acron gets a
partner with geological expertise and funds,  Mikhail Stiskin , an
analyst at Troika Dialog, said today by telephone from Moscow.  Acron has 26 licenses in Saskatchewan, Chairman Alexander Popov said July 26. The Velikiy Novgorod-based company paid
about $60 million for deposits in  Canada  in 2008 and has since
sold two licenses for $11 million, he said.  Rio’s experience and funds will enable North Atlantic
Potash to “be the next producing mine in Canada,” Arie Zuckerman, president of the unit, said in today’s statement.  Tony Shaffer, a spokesman for London-based Rio, confirmed
Acron’s announcement and declined to comment further. Elena Kochubey, a spokeswoman for Acron, also declined to comment.  BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s largest mining company, and
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. also operate in the province.  To contact the reporter on this story:
