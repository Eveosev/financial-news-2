Poland’s WIG20 Index jumped 78.60,
or 3.7 percent, to 2,193.82 at 2:29 p.m. in Warsaw, heading for
the biggest gain since Aug. 11. The gauge has slumped 22 percent
so far this quarter.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, jumped
1.95 zloty, or 6.5 percent, to 32.05 zloty.  Getin Holding SA (GTN)

Leszek Czarnecki, increased 0.34 zloty, or 5 percent, to 7.1
zloty and  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  , majority-owned by UniCredit
SpA, advanced 4.6 zloty, or 3.5 percent, to 135.6 zloty.  The zloty rebounded against the euro and Swiss franc,
easing concern that borrowers will default on foreign-currency

zloty ($58 billion) in July, accounting for 63 percent of all
mortgages, according to the country’s financial regulator.  Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa SA (JSW PW) rose for the first

zloty. The European Union’s largest producer of coking coal may
reach an agreement with the Polish government to acquire 85
percent of the municipal heating company PEC Jastrzebie SA in
coming days, Parkiet reported, citing Jaroslaw Parma, who heads
the JSW unit that will handle the transaction.  Kernel Holding SA (KER)   soared 5.8 zloty, or 9.6
percent, to 66.3 zloty, heading for the biggest daily gain since
December as the largest sunflower-oil producer in Ukraine was
upgraded to “buy” by  Renaissance Capital .  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , Poland’s sole copper
producer, rallied 5.7 zloty, or 4.4 percent, to 135.7 zloty,

refiner, increased 0.43 zloty, or 1.7 percent, to 25.33 zloty.  Copper rebounded from a 14-month low and oil rose on
speculation that European policy makers will intensify efforts
to contain the region’s debt crisis.  PGE SA (PGE PW) climbed for a second day, increasing 0.62
zloty, or 3.5 percent, to 18.12 zloty. UniCredit SpA restarted
