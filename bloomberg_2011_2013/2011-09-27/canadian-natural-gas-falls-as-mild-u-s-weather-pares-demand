Canadian natural gas for October
delivery fell as mild weather forecast for the biggest consuming
region for the nation’s gas exports pared demand.  Chicago’s high temperature may be 74 degrees Fahrenheit (23
Celsius) on Oct. 7, 8 degrees warmer than normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The forecaster
predicts mild temperatures through Oct. 11, paring the need for
extra gas for heating or air conditioning. The Midwest is the
biggest consuming region for Canada’s gas.  “The weather is pretty uninteresting,” said  Martin King ,
senior commodities analyst with FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in
Calgary.  Alberta  gas for October delivery fell 2.5 cents to C$3.495
per gigajoule ($3.255 per million Btu) as of 2:45 p.m. New York
time, according to  NGX,  a Canadian Internet market. November gas
was down 3.75 cents to C$3.5425 per gigajoule. Gas traded on the

priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Gas for October delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 4.5 cents to settle at $3.827 per million Btu.
November gas was up 3 cents to $3.875 per million Btu on the
Nymex.  Regional Prices  Canadian gas for prompt delivery at U.S. points rose amid
forecasts of warm weather on both coasts. Cooling demand in the
Northwest will be 95 percent above normal through Oct. 4,
according to Weather Derivatives. In the Northeast demand will
be 6 percent above normal, the Belton, Missouri-based forecaster
said.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near Chicago
rose 8.28 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $3.9855 per million Btu on
the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that
can carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from
western  Canada .  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas was up 8.62 cents to $3.8105, according to ICE. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas rose 7.71 cents to $3.8768 per million Btu.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.5 billion cubic
feet, 258 million below the target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.67 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.92 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 441 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.44 billion cubic feet today, about 77 percent of its
capacity of 1.88 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.91
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
