Egypt ’s local debt sales will grow
by 25 percent in the next three months from the same period last
year to a record 170 billion Egyptian pounds ($28 billion) as
the country tries to fund its  budget deficit .  The  Finance Ministry  will sell 146.5 billion pounds in
treasury bills, or securities maturing in one-year or less,
according to a  debt sale plan  posted on its website. It plans to
raise 23.5 billion pounds in treasury bonds ranging in maturity
from three years to seven years, the data show. The total amount
compares with 135.5 billion pounds in the same quarter of 2010
and 137.8 billion pounds in the quarter that ends this week.  Egypt’s government is paying the highest yields in almost
three years to borrow through local currency debt sales. The
deficit will probably reach 9.9 percent of gross domestic
product by the end of the fiscal year in June 2012 from 9.5
percent last fiscal year, according to EFG-Hermes Holding SAE,
as energy and food subsidies grow and government salaries climb.
The government is aiming to shrink the gap to 8.6 percent of by
the end of this fiscal year.  The amount of borrowing “itself is not a problem, but it’s
not sustainable in the coming quarters if Egypt wants to avoid a
vicious circle of having to raise more money to pay higher
yields,” said  Wael Ziada , the head of research for Cairo-based
EFG-Hermes, the biggest publicly traded Arab investment bank.
“This is a natural outcome for the rising budget deficit which
has to be financed somehow.”  Yields Rise  The average yield on one-year treasury bills climbed six
basis points to 13.882 percent, the highest level since November
2008, at an auction last week. The country hasn’t sold bonds
with a maturity of more than three years since the start of the
January uprising that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  the
following month. Egypt’s Finance Minister Hazem El Beblawi said
this week he is in talks with Persian Gulf countries to buy
local currency debt to help bring down borrowing costs.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 was little changed at 5.85 percent at 4:34 p.m. in
Cairo. The pound weakened less than 0.1 percent to 5.965 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
