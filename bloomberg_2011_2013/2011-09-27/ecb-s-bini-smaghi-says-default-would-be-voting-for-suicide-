European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said opting for a sovereign
default in the euro region would be “voting for suicide,” the
Australian Financial Review reported, citing an interview.  Greece  is “capable in terms of numbers” to repay its
debt, Bini Smaghi was quoted as saying. At the same time,
“contagion is huge,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
