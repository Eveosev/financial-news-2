ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest
steelmaker, shipped its first  iron ore  from Liberia, the West
African nation that is luring investors for its postwar economic
development.  Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal’s presence in the country is
“a boost to the Liberian economy, especially in the area of
employment,” said President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf at a ceremony
today at the port of Buchanan, 140 kilometers (87 miles) from
Monrovia, the capital.  The company plans to spend $1.5 billion in its Liberia
operation and is exploring new deposits at Yekepa, said Rajesh
Goel, ArcelorMittal Liberia’s Chief Executive Officer. Annual
output is seen at 4 million tons, he added.  “The launch of commercial mining operations represents an
important milestone in the recovery of Liberia’s economy, which
was devastated by 14 years of civil war,” ArcelorMittal said in
a statement published on Business Wire today.  The company has spent $800 million to repair roads and
other infrastructure, it said. A hospital, a school, a railway
and refurbishment of the port are among the projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
