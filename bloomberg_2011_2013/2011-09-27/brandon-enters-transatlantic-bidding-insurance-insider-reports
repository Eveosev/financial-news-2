Joseph Brandon, the former chief
executive officer of reinsurer General Re, is leading a group
of investors negotiating to purchase  Transatlantic Holdings
Inc. (TRH) , Insurance Insider reported.  Morgan Stanley is advising Brandon, and the potential
investors may include private-equity firms, the trade
publication reported. The group may offer cash and stock,
Insurance Insider said, citing unidentified sources.  Transatlantic, the reinsurer previously owned by American
International Group Inc., said yesterday it began discussions
with a party it didn’t name. New York-based Transatlantic also
entered a confidentiality agreement with  Validus Holdings Ltd. (VR) 
after rejecting offers from Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  and Allied World Assurance Company Holdings AG. General Re
is a subsidiary of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire.  A Transatlantic spokesman declined to comment. Brandon
didn’t immediately return a phone message. Pen Pendleton, a
spokesman at Morgan Stanley, didn’t return a message left at his
office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
