Canadian stocks rose for a second
day as metals and fuels rallied on increasing confidence that
European leaders will stem the continent’s debt crisis.  Osisko Mining Corp., which began commercial production at
its Malartic mine in  Quebec  in June, gained 5.3 percent as gold
rose the most in seven weeks.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) ,  Canada ’s
biggest base-metals and coal producer, jumped 6.3 percent as
copper surged.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , the country’s largest oil and
gas producer, climbed 3.9 percent as crude rose as much as 5.6
percent.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index gained 214.32
points, or 1.8 percent, to 11,921.51 at 2:45 p.m. Toronto time.  “There is optimism that  Europe  will start to get ahead of
the bailout problems,”  Todd Johnson , a  money manager  at BCV
Asset Management in Winnipeg, Manitoba, said in a telephone
interview. The firm oversees about C$300 million ($303 million).
“Last week there was a lack of leadership. Now they are focused
on a solution.”  The S&P/TSX advanced 2.1 percent yesterday after tumbling
6.5 percent, the most since March 2009, last week. The stock
benchmark is set to decline for a seventh month, the longest
streak since 1984, as raw-materials and energy companies have
retreated with commodity prices. The industries make up 47
percent of Canadian stocks by market value, according to
Bloomberg data.  Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won parliamentary
backing today for a property tax to meet deficit-reduction
targets required to avoid default.  Mining Shares  Canadian precious and base metal mining companies advanced
after gold gained for the first time in five days in New York
after the biggest three-day drop in 28 years. Silver rose after
touching a 10-month low yesterday. Copper advanced after
tumbling to a 14-month low.  Osisko Mining gained 5.3 percent to C$13.80. Teck Resources
jumped 6.3 percent to C$33.17.  Mercator Minerals Ltd. (ML) , which
mines copper and molybdenum, surged 6.5 percent to C$1.81.

percent to C$2.34.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , the country’s second-biggest
publicly traded copper producer, increased 14 percent to
C$16.99.  Silver Wheaton Corp. (SLW) , Canada’s fourth-biggest precious-
metals company by market value, rallied 3.1 percent to C$34.12.  Fertilizer producers advanced as corn and wheat futures
advanced for a second day on speculation that price declines
last week increased demand for the crops.  Rating Raised  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest
fertilizer producer by market value, increased 3.6 percent to
C$50.42. The Saskatoon, Canada-based company was raised to
“overweight” from “neutral” at Atlantic Equities LLP.  Agrium
Inc. (AGU) , a fertilizer producer and farm retailer, climbed 3.1
percent to C$77.35.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index rose 2.8 percent to extend
yesterday’s gain as crude futures advanced.  Suncor Energy surged 3.9 percent to C$28.73 after climbing
5.8 percent, the most intraday since November 2010.  Canadian
Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , the country’s second-biggest energy
company by market value, gained 2.7 percent to C$32.41. Ivanhoe
Energy Inc., an oil-sands developer with projects in Canada and
Ecuador, jumped 16 percent to C$1.27 after advancing 19 percent,
the most intraday since December 2010.  Ivanhoe Mines  rebounded from a seven day slump, soaring 21
percent to C$18.09, after Rio Tinto Group increased its stake by
0.5 percent to 49 percent. The shares had declined 9 percent
yesterday, after the government of Mongolia said it is seeking
to boost its holding in a joint Ivanhoe-Rio Tinto project in the
Asian country. Ivanhoe Mines rallied as much as 26 percent today
in the biggest intraday advance since February 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
