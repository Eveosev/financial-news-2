Goodrich Corp. (GR)  shareholders sued in
New York state court to block the proposed $16.5 billion
takeover by  United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  contending the price is
too low.  The New Jersey Carpenters Annuity Fund sued United
Technologies and some Goodrich directors and officers yesterday
in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, saying the
proposed payment is “inadequate and undervalues the company.”  United Technologies, based in Hartford,  Connecticut , on
Sept. 21 said it had agreed to buy Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Goodrich, adding a maker of aircraft landing gear and jet-
turbine casings to take advantage of a record surge in
commercial plane orders.  “The proposed transaction provides for no meaningful
premium to Goodrich’s public shareholders, as the consummation
of the proposed transaction will result in the complete loss of
control over the company and its prospects,” the fund said in
the complaint.  The bid represents a premium of 47 percent to Goodrich’s
closing share price on Sept. 15, the day before merger talks
were reported.  John Moran, a spokesman for United Technologies, said he
hadn’t seen the lawsuit and declined to comment on the
complaint. Lisa Bottle, a spokeswoman for Goodrich, didn’t
immediately return a voice-mail message.  The case is New Jersey Carpenters Annuity Fund vs. Corvi,
652637/2011, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
