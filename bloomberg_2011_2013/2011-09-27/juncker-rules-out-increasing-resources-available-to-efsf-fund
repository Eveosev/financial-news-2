Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker
ruled out an increase in the 440 billion-euro ($600 billion)
European Financial Stability Facility as a way to help stem the
debt crisis, saying attention is focused on using the rescue
fund as effectively as possible.   “There will be no raising of the resources available to
the European facility,” Juncker, who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers, told reporters today in Strasbourg,
 France . “That won’t happen.”  Euro-region leaders agreed in July to expand the EFSF’s
role by allowing the fund to buy sovereign bonds on the
secondary market, grant aid to banks and offer credit lines to
distressed euro-area governments. The EFSF currently sells bonds
to finance rescue loans.   “We will use the new instruments of the financial backstop
as efficiently as possible,” Juncker said. He declined to
answer a question about the prospects for leveraging the EFSF.  To contact the reporter on this story:
