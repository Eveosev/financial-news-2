Taiwan , the fourth-biggest buyer of
U.S. corn, agreed to purchase 303 million bushels to 413 million
bushels in the next two years, according Illinois Governor  Pat Quinn .  The 22-member delegation from the Taiwan Feed Industry
Group agreed to import additional Illinois grain in 2012 and
2013 and signed letters of intent with the Illinois Corn Growers
Association and the Illinois Soybean Association during a visit
today to the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in
Springfield, Quinn said today in an e-mailed statement. The deal
includes an additional 0.75 million metric tons of feed products
made from corn, according to the statement.  The delegation, which included representatives from
Taiwanâ€™s Vegetable Oil Manufacturers and Oilseed Processing
Association, signed similar letters outlining its intent to
purchase as much as 118 million bushels of U.S. soybeans.
Illinois is the largest U.S. producer of corn and soybeans,
after Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
