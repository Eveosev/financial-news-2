U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff
agreed to review a lawsuit against Primeo Fund by the liquidator
of  Bernard Madoff ’s firm, according to a court filing.  The so-called feeder fund is one of several that sought to
move its case out of bankruptcy court, saying that trustee
Irving Picard’s demand for return of funds taken out of the
 Ponzi scheme  raised issues of federal law that should be
decided by a higher court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
