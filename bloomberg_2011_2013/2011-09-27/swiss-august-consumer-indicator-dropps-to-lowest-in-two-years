A gauge of Swiss consumer demand
dropped to the lowest in almost two years in August, adding to
signs the economy is cooling.  The consumption indicator, which signals developments about
three months ahead, declined to 0.79 from a revised 1.28 in
July, Zurich-based UBS AG said in an e-mailed statement today.
That’s the lowest since September 2009. It had previously
reported a July reading of 1.29.  Switzerland ’s economy may struggle to gather strength after
a surge in the franc to a record against the euro last month
hurt exports and earnings. The Swiss government said last week
that “the labor market is showing the first signs that the
positive trend may be turning” and cut its forecast for 2012
private consumption growth to 1.3 percent from 1.7 percent.
Unemployment may rise next year, it said.  The drop “is attributable at least in part to the
appreciation of the franc,” UBS said in the statement. “This
extreme overvaluation may well have unnerved consumers and
prompted them to cut some of their spending.”  The consumer indicator is based on new car sales, retail
sales, the number of domestic overnight stays by Swiss
residents,  consumer confidence  and credit-card transactions made
via UBS at points of sale in Switzerland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
