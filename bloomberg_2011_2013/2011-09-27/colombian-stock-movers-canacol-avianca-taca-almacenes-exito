14 months in Bogota trading after the company said its oil

Hermoso and Entrerrios fields.  Canacol shares rose 13 percent to 1,240 pesos, snapping a

year that ended June 30 were 4.5 million barrels, compared to
2.6 million barrels the year before, according to a statement on
its website.  “After the company’s reserves increased, investors started
seeing that the share’s correction may have been excessive,”
said Mauricio Restrepo del Toro, analyst at brokerage Bolsa y
Renta. “Now people are a little more calm.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
