Shareholders of  Oceanic Bank
International Plc (OCEANIC) , a Nigerian lender bailed out by the central
bank two years ago, approved a plan by  Ecobank Transnational
Inc. (ETI)  to acquire it, said Hayford Alile, Oceanic’s chairman.  Lome, Togo-based Ecobank Transnational may “merge Oceanic
Bank with Ecobank  Nigeria ,” Alile told reporters today in Lagos,
referring to the lender’s unit in the West Africa nation. The
move will “thereby save it from possible liquidation,” he said.  Oceanic’s chief executive was among eight bank bosses who
were fired by the Central Bank of Nigeria in 2009 amid a lending
crisis. The central bank gave lenders until Sept. 30 to
recapitalize or face liquidation or nationalization. Ecobank
agreed on July 30 to acquire and recapitalize Oceanic.  Since then, Ecobank’s stock has plummeted 26 percent on the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange , outpacing a 16 percent decline in the
All-Share Index. Ecobank closed at the lowest level in two years
today, dropping 4.4 percent, or 51 kobo, to 11.16 naira by the
2:30 p.m. close.  Oceanic investors “will receive one share of Ecobank for 20
Oceanic shares,” Alile said. Shares of Oceanic have been placed
on technical suspension by the bourse, meaning that the trades
are permitted even as the price cannot change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
