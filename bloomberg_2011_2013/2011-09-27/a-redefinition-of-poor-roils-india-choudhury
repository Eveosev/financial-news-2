How poor is very poor in  India , home to a substantial percentage of the world's poorest people? A quantitative statement on this subject last week in the Supreme Court by the  Planning Commission of India , a government body involved with many aspects of the country's economic policy, was met with disbelief and derision by the media and the public. The commission  said that it had recommended  that the poverty line be fixed at 965 rupees per capita per month (about $0.65 a day) for people living in urban areas and 781 rupees per capita per month (slightly more than $0.50 a day) for those living in rural areas. Based on this very conservative cut-off point -- itself a figure revised upward after the  Supreme Court  objected to an earlier projection -- the commission estimated the population in India living below the poverty line at a little more than 407 million people. That is almost one-third of the population. The news immediately sparked a debate about how accurately poverty is measured in India, a matter of the greatest significance for a country that is struggling to improve the conditions of a great mass of people, and for a welfare state that has to decide how to apportion subsidies and disbursements of food and fuel. The commission's recommendations were based on a report submitted in 2009 by the  Suresh Tendulkar Committee , which abandoned an older method of estimating poverty by a measure of  calorie intake . Instead, it adopted a more sophisticated method that examines spending on food, clothing, education and health, and sets different poverty lines for urban and rural areas. There was disbelief – even horror – in India that an arm of the government could insist that a person might earn such a small sum, or a little more, and still not be considered below the poverty line. The commission was excoriated by the main opposition party, the BJP, which alleged that the panel's head, the economist  Montek Singh Ahluwalia , and Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  (himself an economist) had " no idea of real poverty ." It was also attacked by columnists, one of whom, Tavleen Singh,  wrote : Several periodicals, including  Mint , sent journalists to interview the very poor and report their reactions to this news. Some, like the weekly magazine Tehelka, republished sarcastic pieces about the " new Indian rich ," that is to say poor people who made a little more than the cut-off initially suggested by the commission, and found themselves north of the poverty line. All this ensured that a wealth of valuable anecdotal data about the lives of the poor found its way into the newspapers (which are often accused, with some justification, of ignoring the poor at the expense of India's growing consumer class). Yet it might be said that the media's interpretation of the commission's assessment of poverty distorted the public's perception of an issue that requires a little more attention to context. While the commission's claim is definitely debatable – one commentator thought the figures  should be doubled  – it isn't as heartless as it appears. Firstly, the commission was drawing a mathematical line not between the poor and the rich, but between the very poor and the rest. Secondly, and more importantly, one might argue that the error made by many journalists was in taking the idea of "per capita" literally and addressing the very poor as individuals. For example, a piece on the New York Times'  India Ink  site reported the reaction of Pyarelal, a cobbler in New Delhi: This might not accurately reflect the commission's findings. The panel's head, Ahluwalia, when confronted with this question, explained in  the Hindu  that it was much more reasonable and realistic to compute the figure for a family than for an individual. He said: The position was amplified by the columnist TN Ninan, who explained in an article in the Business Standard called " Poverty Redefined ": Ninan's suggestion echoed an under-reported part of the commission's statement, which said: "At June 2011 price level, for a family of five, this provisional poverty line would amount to Rs.4,824 per month [about $100] in urban areas and Rs.3,905 per month [more than $80] in rural areas." When put this way, the claim no longer seems as disturbing. Indeed, millions of single-income households in urban and rural areas in India make do on such sums every month. The meaning of these figures can be cross-checked and better understood when compared with India's per capita income,  which in 2011 is estimated to be 54,527 rupees , or a little more than $1,100. If the average income is less than $100 a month, it isn't very shocking that the very poor should make about that much as a household. The issue then becomes not so much whether the commission is out of touch with Indian realities – it seems clear that it isn't – but whether food subsidized by the government should, at a time when  food inflation  is above 10 percent, be denied to households making marginally more than the poverty line. This was again a  question posed to Ahluwalia : It seems, then, that much of the Indian media, by emphasizing a single remark, missed the chance to ask more substantive questions about the poor and government policy. For instance, some commentators took the opportunity to address the more relevant issue of whether the government's public distribution system  should be universal , and not targeted at just the very poor, as it has been since 1997. Much more constructive than the ire at the commission's estimates was a proposal endorsed by more than two dozen prominent economists to delink food entitlements from poverty measurement altogether. The  Times of India  reported: More  here . And elsewhere there was debate over the government's proposed  Food Security Bill , which would cover two-thirds of India's 1.2 billion people and almost double the annual expenditure on food subsidies. Earlier in September the government invited  comments from the public  on the draft of the measure. Meanwhile, no matter how the poverty line is calibrated, it seems clear that India is still very far not just from rooting out the most desperate kind of poverty, but also from ending its status, in one observer's memorable but depressing phrase, as the  republic of hunger .
