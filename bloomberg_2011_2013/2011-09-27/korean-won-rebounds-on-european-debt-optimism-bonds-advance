South Korea ’s won rebounded from
near a one-year low as optimism grew European leaders will act
to contain a regional debt crisis that prompted global funds to
seek refuge in the dollar. Bonds gained.  European Central Bank policy makers are likely to debate
restarting covered-bond purchases along with further measures to
ease monetary conditions next week, a euro-region central bank
official said. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on Sept. 25
that euro-region leaders must erect a firewall around  Greece  to
avert market attacks on other European states. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index jumped 2.3 percent in  New York  and the Stoxx
 Europe  600 Index advanced 1.9 percent yesterday.  “Investors sold a lot of dollars today as sentiment eased
following developments in Europe’s debt talks,” said Yu Won Jun, a currency dealer with Korea Exchange Bank in Seoul.
“Exporters’ selling dollars to convert income also supported
the won.”  The won rose the most since June 2010, jumping 1.6 percent
to 1,173.55 per dollar at the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, trimming
this month’s slide to 9.1 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,196.13 on Sept. 23, the
weakest level since September 2010.  South Korea’s consumer confidence held this month at the
lowest level since March, according to the findings of a central
bank survey published today. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  rose 5 percent,
rebounding from its worst close since June 2010, as overseas
investors bought 170.5 billion won ($145.3 million) more of the
nation’s stocks than they sold today, after cutting holdings for
three days.  The government’s benchmark three-year bonds advanced. The
yield on the 3.5 percent debt due June 2014 fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.45 percent, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show.  South Korea’s fiscal deficit will narrow next year to 14.3
trillion won, or 1 percent of gross domestic product, from 25
trillion won, or 2 percent of GDP, in 2011, the ministry of
finance said in a budget proposal today. The economy will grow
at an annual pace of about 4.5 percent through 2015, the
ministry forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
