Deposits at banks in Cyprus fell
2.2 percent in August from the previous month, to 69.8 billion
euros ($94 billion), the  central bank  said in a  statement  on its
website today.  The decline resulted from a 2.5 percent drop in deposits
held by people outside the euro area, which fell to 20.9 billion
euros, and a 4 percent drop in deposits belonging to residents
of other euro-area countries, to 5.2 billion euros. Deposits
held by Cyprus residents fell 1.8 percent to 43.7 billion euros.  Withdrawals followed cuts in Cyprus’s sovereign credit
rating to Baa1 from A2 by Moody’s Investors Service on July 27
and to BBB from A- by  Fitch Ratings  on Aug. 8; both companies
cited fiscal concerns.  Fluctuations in deposits are a normal phenomenon, the
central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
