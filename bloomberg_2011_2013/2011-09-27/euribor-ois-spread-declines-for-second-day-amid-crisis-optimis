The Euribor-OIS spread, which
measures banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in  Europe ,
declined for a second day amid optimism policy makers will
announce measures to help contain the region’s sovereign crisis.  The spread, the difference between three-month Euribor and
overnight index swaps, narrowed to 81 basis points as of 3:10
p.m. in London, from 88 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The gap rose to 89 basis points on Sept. 23, the
widest since March 2009.  “Investors still have high hopes that some news will
emerge and make it all better,” Anke Richter, a credit
strategist at Mizuho International Plc in London, wrote in a
note.  The cost for European banks to convert euro payments into
dollars, measured by the one-year cross-currency basis swap,
declined to 66.5 basis points less than the euro interbank
offered rate, from 70.5 basis points yesterday. The cost was 75
basis points under Euribor on Sept. 22, when the swap was the
most expensive since December 2008. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The three-month cross-currency basis swap was 100 basis
points below Euribor, compared with 106 basis points yesterday,
Bloomberg data show. The swap cost 112.5 basis points under the
benchmark on Sept. 12, the most in almost three years.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
loans in euros -- increased to 1.537 percent from 1.535 percent
yesterday. One-week Euribor rose to 1.211 percent from 1.195
percent.  Libor Rises  The three-month dollar  London  interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose to 0.365 percent from 0.363 percent, according to
the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the highest since
August 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, was little
changed at 36 basis points.  The ECB said financial institutions increased overnight
deposits. Banks parked 165 billion euros ($225 billion) with the
Frankfurt-based lender yesterday, compared with 151 billion
euros on Sept. 23 and 198 billion euros on Sept. 12, the ECB
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
