Hussey Copper Ltd., a maker of
copper products, and five affiliates sought  bankruptcy
protection  from creditors without giving a reason.  The company, based 14 miles west of Pittsburgh in
Leetsdale, Pennsylvania, listed more than $100 million in both
assets and debt in Chapter 11 documents filed today in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Wilmington,  Delaware .  Hussey, which traces its roots back to 1848, calls itself
the “leading producer of copper bus bar in the world,”
according to its  website . The company also makes copper sheet,
strip and wiring in addition to the bars used in the manufacture
of electrical equipment.  Mark Minuti, an attorney for the company, wasn’t
immediately available to return a phone calling seeking comment
on the bankruptcy filing.  Copper for delivery in three months has surged 147 percent
since the end of 2008 on the London Metal Exchange, touching a
record $10,190 a metric ton on Feb. 15. Since then, concern that
a slowing global economy would curb demand for raw materials has
sent prices lower. The metal has dropped 21 percent this year to
$7,594 today on the LME.  The 20 largest unsecured creditors holding claims against
the company and its affiliates are owed about $24.6 million,
according to court papers. Metal Management Pittsburgh Inc. of
Elizabeth,  Pennsylvania , is the biggest creditor, owed about
$9.1 million, followed by CMC Recycling, owed about
$2.7 million, and HKP Metals Inc. with a claim of $2.6 million.  The case is In re Hussey Copper Corp., 11-13010, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
