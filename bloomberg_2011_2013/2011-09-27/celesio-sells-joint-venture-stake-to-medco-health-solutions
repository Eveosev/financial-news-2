Medco Health Solutions Inc. (MHS)  and
 Celesio AG (CLS1)  agreed to end their 15-month-old partnership on
services for chronically ill patients.  Celesio sold its 50 percent stake in the venture back to
its partner, the Stuttgart, Germany-based drug distributor said
in a statement today. Medco, based in  Franklin Lakes , New
Jersey, will take full ownership of the venture effective Sept.
30. The two companies didn’t disclose the purchase price or
other terms of the deal.  The Medco-Celesio joint venture had announced a single
contract, with Deutsche BIG, a German “sick fund” similar to a
health insurer, since its founding in June 2010. Meanwhile,
costs associated with the deal contributed to an 8.3 percent
drop in first-quarter profit for Celesio.  Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) 
offered to buy Medco in July, in a $29.1 billion deal that would
form the biggest U.S. pharmacy-benefits manager.  The Amsterdam-based Medco International unit “will carry
on with all of the joint venture’s business activities,” the
companies said in the statement today.  Celesio rose 71 cents, or 6.8 percent, to 11.01 euros at
the 5:30 p.m. close of trading in Frankfurt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
