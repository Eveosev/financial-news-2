Thailand ’s baht snapped a four-day
drop on speculation exporters will take advantage of the
currency’s decline to a one-year low to convert income at a
more-favorable  exchange rate .  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares rose on
optimism European leaders will act to contain the region’s debt
crisis, boosting demand for emerging-market assets. Policy
makers at the  European Central Bank  are likely to debate
restarting covered-bond purchases, a euro-region central bank
official said on condition of anonymity.  “We can expect exporter demand toward the month-end,”
said Tohru Nishihama, a Tokyo-based economist at Dai-ichi Life
Research Institute Inc. “The stock-market rally is supporting
sentiment, but the baht may remain under pressure due to risk
aversion.”  The baht gained 0.5 percent to 30.98 per dollar as of 3:03
p.m. in Bangkok after touching 31.22 earlier, the weakest level
since September 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has dropped 3.3 percent this month and 0.8 percent
this quarter. The baht may slide toward 31.50 by the end of this
week, Nishihama said.  Government bonds  gained for a second day. The yield on the
5.25 percent notes due May 2014 declined six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 3.53 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
