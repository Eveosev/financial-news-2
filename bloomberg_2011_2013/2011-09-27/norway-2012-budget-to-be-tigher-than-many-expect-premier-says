Norway’s 2012 budget will be
tighter than many expect and may trigger “protests,” Prime
Minister Jens Stoltenberg, said in a speech in Oslo today.  “In many areas of the coming budget we will propose to
spend less than many expect,” Stoltenberg said. His government
will present the 2012 budget on Oct. 6.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
