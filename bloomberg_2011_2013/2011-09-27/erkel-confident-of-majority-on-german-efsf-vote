German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said that she remained confident of winning a majority among her
coalition lawmakers for a vote in parliament on Sept. 29 on
enhancements to the European rescue fund.  Merkel was speaking to reporters in Berlin today after 11
members of her Christian Democratic bloc rejected proposed
changes to the fund and two abstained in a trial vote, Deutsche
Presse-Agentur reported.  The vote was a test run for the ballot in the full
chamber in parliament on planned enhancements to the European
Financial Stability Facility. Not all 237 members of Merkelâ€™s
 Christian Democrats  and their CSU Bavarian allies were present
at the vote today, DPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
