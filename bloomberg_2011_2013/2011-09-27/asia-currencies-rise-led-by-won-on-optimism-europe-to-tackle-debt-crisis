Asian currencies strengthened, led
by gains in  South Korea ’s won and  Indonesia ’s rupiah, on
optimism European leaders will take decisive action to tackle a
regional debt crisis that’s spurred demand for dollars.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index rose from near a
10-month low and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares rebounded
from its worst close since May 2010. An official said the
 European Central Bank  may restart covered-bond purchases along
with further measures to ease monetary conditions. U.S. Treasury
Secretary Timothy F. Geithner predicted that European
governments will use more force to resolve their debt woes.  “Rallies in global stock markets are helping Asian
currencies today as sentiment improved a bit due to some news
from  Europe ,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi
Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “Whether this bounce
will continue or not remains uncertain.”  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
used currencies excluding the yen, rose 0.1 percent to 115.16 as
of 4:35 p.m. in  Hong Kong . A Sept. 22 close of 114.22 was the
lowest since November 2010. The won strengthened 1.6 percent to
1,173.55 per dollar, while the rupiah climbed 1.4 percent to
8,933. Malaysia’s ringgit advanced 1.2 percent to 3.1495.  Selloff ‘Overdone’  The Asia Dollar Index tumbled 3.8 percent this month,
poised for its biggest loss since the Asian financial crisis in
1997. The MSCI index of regional shares dropped 9.2 percent, the
most since May 2010.  “There’s some rebound in risk appetite as the selloff in
stocks and currencies was a bit overdone,” said Nik M. Khairul,
a treasury dealer at Asian Finance Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur .  The ECB is under pressure to increase stimulus as Europe’s
worsening debt crisis tightens conditions in money markets. The
monetary authority purchased 60 billion euros ($81 billion) of
covered bonds in a one-year program that expired in June 2010
and was aimed at freeing up banks’ balance sheets and
encouraging lending during the region’s worst recession since
World War II.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said on Sept. 25 that euro-
region leaders must erect a firewall around  Greece  to avert
market attacks on other European states. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index jumped 2.3 percent in New York yesterday and the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index advanced 2.4 percent today.  Yuan Strengthens  China ’s yuan gained 0.02 percent to 6.3992 per dollar,
snapping a three-day drop, on speculation policy makers will
allow currency gains to stem increases in consumer prices in the
world’s second-biggest economy. Inflation cooled to 6.2 percent
in August from a three-year high of 6.5 percent the previous
month, official data show.  The nation should maintain a proactive fiscal policy along
with prudent monetary policy because it helps curb inflation,
Jia Kang, head of the research institute for fiscal science
under the ministry of finance, wrote in a commentary in the
People’s Daily today.  “Investors are buying into the market as European
political leaders seem to be acting to stabilize the
situation,” said Banny Lam, a Hong Kong-based economist at CCB
International Securities Ltd. “Even if global economic growth
falls sharply, China will continue to let the yuan gain to lower
the cost of imports.”  Elsewhere,  Taiwan ’s dollar rose 0.4 percent to NT$30.456.
The island’s central bank will end a run of five interest-rate
increases at a quarterly policy review on Sept. 29, according to
12 of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest predict
another 0.125 percentage point rise.  Thailand ’s baht advanced 0.6 percent to 30.96. Bond and
currency markets in the Philippines were closed today as Typhoon
Nesat hit the nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
