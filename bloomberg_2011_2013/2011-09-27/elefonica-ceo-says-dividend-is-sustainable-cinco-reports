Executive Officer Cesar Alierta said the company’s dividend
policy is “sustainable” and that Telefonica’s share price
doesn’t reflect the company’s true value,  Cinco Dias  reported.  Telefonica, which is growing at lower rates in its European
markets compared with  Latin America , isn’t experiencing a
further deterioration in its Spanish market during the second
half of the year and doesn’t foresee another recession in the
economy, Alierta said at an event in Aragon,  Spain , Cinco Dias
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
