Brazil ’s decision to cut a tax on
gasoline may discourage investment in sugar cane mills that
produce ethanol, according to Tonon Bioenergia SA.  The Cide tax, charged on gasoline that state-owned oil
company  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  sells to distributors, was
reduced to 19 centavos (11 cents) a liter from 23 centavos,
according to a  presidential decree  published today in the
country’s official gazette. The cut may also reduce ethanol
prices, which is typically 70 percent of the price of gasoline,
said Paulo Luccas, commercial manager for Sao Paulo-based
ethanol producer Tonon.  Rising production costs and falling margins for ethanol
producers have led to a dearth of investment in new cane
plantations and mills, he said.  The industry’s total production capacity “has to grow 10
percent annually to keep pace with demand,” Luccas said today
in an interview. “Every day it seems less likely that the
industry will reach those growth rates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
