Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , eager to shore
up investors’ confidence after the ouster of Leo Apotheker as
chief executive officer, appointed Lynn Anderson acting chief
communications officer.  Anderson, who joined Hewlett-Packard in 1983, will report
to Chief Executive Officer  Meg Whitman . Anderson previously led
day-to-day operations for the communications department and
before that, she oversaw analyst and media relations for
Hewlett-Packard’s enterprise business.  Whitman, who succeeded Apotheker on Sept. 22, is aiming to
reverse a share-price slump and growth slowdown after her
predecessor reduced sales forecasts three times. His tenure was
marked by strategy shifts and information leaks that left
shareholders distrustful of management.  “As we continue to execute our strategy for HP,
communications will be an extremely important function and it is
critical that we speak with one voice,” Whitman wrote in a memo
to senior staff, according to the AllThingsD blog, which
previously reported Anderson’s role change.  Anderson took over day-to-day communications on Aug. 25
after former chief communications officer  Bill Wohl  stepped down
from that job, which he had held since January.  At the time, Chief Marketing Officer Marty Homlish
represented the corporate communications team on the executive
council of Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard. Anderson
is now taking on those responsibilities as well, said spokesman
Michael Thacker.  To contact the reporters on this story:
