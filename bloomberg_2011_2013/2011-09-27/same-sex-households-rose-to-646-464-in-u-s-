The number of same-sex households
in the U.S. rose to 646,464 in 2010, up from 594,391 a decade
earlier, the U.S. Census Bureau said.  The bureau said today that the number revises the initial
census count of 901,997 for same-sex couples in 2010.  The revised figure includes 131,729 same-sex married
couples and 514,735 same-sex unmarried couples.  “What we want to try to do is basically correct the census
numbers,” said Martin O’Connell, chief of the bureau’s fertility
and family statistics branch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
