Montenegro secured an $85 million
loan from the  World Bank  and will use the funds to support its
next year’s budget, the  Finance Ministry  said.  The 20-year loan, with a five-year grace period, carries a
cost of 0.80 percent on top of the six-month Euro interbank
offered rate, the Podgorica, Montenegro-based ministry said in
an e-mailed statement today.  Conditions for the loan’s approval included “achieving a
satisfying level of macroeconomic stability” and the
stabilization of the financial and banking system, the ministry
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
