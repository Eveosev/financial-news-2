Following is the text of U.S.
consumer confidence from the Conference Board.  The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index, which had
declined sharply in August, remained essentially unchanged in
September. The Index now stands at 45.4 (1985=100), up slightly
from 45.2 in August. The Present Situation Index decreased to
32.5 from 34.3. The Expectations Index edged up to 54.0 from
52.4 last month.  The monthly Consumer Confidence Survey, based on a
probability-design random sample, is conducted for The
Conference Board by Nielsen, a leading global provider of
information and analytics around what consumers buy and watch.
The cutoff date for the preliminary results was September 15th.  Says  Lynn Franco , Director of The Conference Board Consumer
Research Center: “The pessimism that shrouded consumers last
month has spilled over into September. Consumer expectations,
which had plummeted in August, posted a marginal gain. However,
consumers expressed greater concern about their expected
earnings, a sign that does not bode well for spending. In
addition, consumers’ assessment of current conditions declined
for the fifth consecutive month, a sign that the economic
environment remains weak.”  Consumers’ assessment of current conditions weakened
further in September. Those claiming business conditions are
“good” decreased to 11.7 percent from 14.1 percent, while those
claiming business conditions are “bad” remained virtually
unchanged at 40.4 percent. Consumers’ appraisal of employment
conditions, however, was mixed. Those claiming jobs are “hard to
get” increased to 50.0 percent from 48.5 percent, while those
stating jobs are “plentiful” increased to 5.5 percent from 4.8
percent.  Consumers’ short-term outlook, which had deteriorated
sharply last month, improved slightly in September. Those
expecting business conditions to improve over the next six
months decreased to 11.3 percent from 11.8 percent, while those
expecting business conditions to worsen declined to 22.6 percent
from 24.6 percent.  Consumers were also slightly less pessimistic about the
outlook for the job market. Those anticipating more jobs in the
months ahead edged up to 12.0 percent from 11.8 percent, while
those expecting fewer jobs declined to 28.6 percent from 31.2
percent. The proportion of consumers anticipating an increase in
their incomes, however, declined to 13.3 percent from 14.3
percent.  SOURCE: The Conference Board             http://www.conference -
