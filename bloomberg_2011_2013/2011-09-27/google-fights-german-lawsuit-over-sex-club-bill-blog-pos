Google Inc. (GOOG)  is challenging a suit
in  Germany ’s top civil court over claims the world’s largest
search engine company is liable for a defamatory statement in a
posting on its blogspot.com website.  Google argued at a hearing at the Federal Court of Justice
in Karlsruhe today that U.S. law should apply in the dispute
brought by a German who sued over a blog entry claiming he used
a business credit card to pay for “sex club bills.” The blog
was about life on the Spanish island of  Mallorca , where the
plaintiff resided.  “The connection to Germany is really rather limited,”
said Thomas von Plehwe, Google’s attorney. “My client here is a
host provider in  California  that only provides the technical
framework to allow users to run post blogs and it would be
impossible for it to monitor millions of sites for a special
line of words.”  U.S. companies try to avoid German courts in Internet cases
as liability can be stricter in that country than under U.S.
law. The same court last year ruled the New York Times can be
sued in Germany over statements on the newspaper’s website if
there is a strong connection to the country in an article.  The plaintiff, who wasn’t identified, is seeking a ruling
forcing Google to make sure that the statements won’t be
repeated on its blogspot site.  Mountain View , California-based
Google lost in two lower courts over the issue.  The court scheduled a ruling for Oct. 25.  Today’s case is BGH, VI ZR 93/10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
