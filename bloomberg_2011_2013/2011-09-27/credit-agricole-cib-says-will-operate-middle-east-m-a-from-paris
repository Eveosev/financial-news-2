Credit Agricole  CIB, the corporate-
and investment-banking unit of France’s third largest bank, will
guide Gulf-region clients on mergers and acquisitions from Paris
because it doesn’t plan to keep an advisory team in the area.  “We will cover the clients’ needs from Paris,” Bertrand
Hugonet, a Credit Agricole CIB spokesman in the city, said by
telephone today. “We are adapting the set-up. We don’t have a
team on location but we can answer our clients’ needs, namely in
cross-border operations,” he said. He declined to specify how
many people work on acquisitions in the Gulf area.  Reuters reported earlier today that  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  is
planning to close its Dubai-based mergers-and-acquisitions
operations, citing an interview with Bernard Mignucci, head of
Credit Agricole CIB in the emirate. Credit Agricole is also
closing its offices in Bahrain and will complete moving staff to
Dubai by the end of 2012, Reuters said.  Credit Agricole hasn’t closed its office in Bahrain, the
spokesman said.  Mignucci, previously in charge of Credit Agricole CIB’s
operations in  Brazil , has been appointed as head of the Gulf
countries, Hugonet said. Mignucci is based in Dubai and replaces
Amr Al Kabbani.  Albert Momdjian, previously head of Credit Agricole’s
investment banking for the  Middle East  and North Africa, was
hired by UBS AG in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
