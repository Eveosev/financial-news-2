Electra Private Equity Plc (ELTA) , a
British investment fund, agreed to sell its stake in SAV Credit
Ltd. to Varde Partners for about 40 million pounds ($62.7
million).  SAV has about half a million customers and more than 600
million pounds of assets, Electra said in a statement today. SAV
acquired the Marbles credit card portfolio from HSBC Holdings
Plc in October 2007 and bought a credit card unit from Citigroup
Inc. in March 2010.  Electra began investing in SAV in October 2006 with Palamon
Capital Partners, it said.  “This is a perfect example of crisis breeding
opportunity,” David Symondson, deputy managing partner of
Electra Partners, the manager of Electra Private Equity Plc,
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
