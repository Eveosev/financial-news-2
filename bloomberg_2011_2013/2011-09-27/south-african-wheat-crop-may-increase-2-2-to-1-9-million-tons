South Africa ’s wheat crop may rise
2.2 percent to 1.9 million metric tons this season from a year
earlier, according to the country’s Crop Estimates Committee.  The reason for the increase is better than expected yields
in the Free State and North West provinces, Marda Scheepers, a
spokeswoman for the Committee, said by phone from  Pretoria 
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
