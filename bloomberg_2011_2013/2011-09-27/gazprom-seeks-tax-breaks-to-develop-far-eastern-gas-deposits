OAO Gazprom is seeking tax breaks
to develop natural-gas deposits off  Russia ’s Pacific coast and
in the Yakutia region, Viktor Timoshilov, head of eastern
projects, said today.  Exempting the deposits of the mineral extraction tax and
lowering or canceling  customs duties  would help “successfully”
implement eastern projects, Timoshilov said at a conference in
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, on Sakhalin Island in Russia’s Far East.  Gazprom is seeking similar tax breaks the government
provided to oil companies for initial development of crude
deposits in Russia’s eastern regions, Gazprom said in an e-
mailed statement, citing Timoshilov.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
