HTC Corp. (2498) ’s patent infringement
complaint seeking to block U.S. imports of  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone,
iPad and Mac computers will be investigated by a trade agency.  The U.S. International Trade Commission in  Washington  said
today it would consider the complaint, according to a  notice  on
its website. Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC, Asia’s second-biggest
maker of smartphones, filed the case last month against
Cupertino, California-based Apple.  ITC investigations typically take 15 to 18 months to
complete.  To contact the reporter on this story:
