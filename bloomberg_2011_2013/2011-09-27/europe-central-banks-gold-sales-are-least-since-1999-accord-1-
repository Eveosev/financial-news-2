Gold sales by European nations and
the  International Monetary Fund  under an annual agreement
between central banks in the past year were the least since the
first accord began more than a decade ago.  European central banks sold about 1.1 metric tons and the
IMF 52.2 tons in the year to Sept. 26, the World Gold Council
said in an e-mailed statement. That’s 61 percent less than the
amount sold in the previous year and at least the seventh
consecutive year that sales fell short of the limit. The accord
sets a limit of 400 tons each year through September 2014 and
accommodated 181.3 tons of IMF sales that ended in December.  Central banks globally are expanding reserves for the first
time in a generation as the price of the metal heads for an
11th straight annual gain and assets in exchange-traded products
jumped. Central banks and government institutions worldwide
bought 192.3 tons in the first half, according to the London-
based council. In 1999, several nations signed an initial five-
year agreement limiting gold sales to help stabilize the market.  The accord “provides some discipline for the central
banks,” said  Daniel Briesemann , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt . “I don’t expect that central banks will sell much
gold in the new year of the agreement. It looks very likely that
central banks will continue to expand their reserves and
therefore buy gold” globally, he said.  The current accord lowered the allowed sales down from 500
tons a year in the previous five-year period. The limit had been
400 tons a year in the five years through 2004. Nations and
international organizations have 30,707.1 tons of bullion
reserves, valued at about $1.64 trillion, according to the
council.  In the year to Sept. 26, 2004, the final year of the first
period, central banks sold 385 tons of the allowed 400 tons.
That took total sales in the five-year period to the limit of
2,000 tons.  Gold for immediate delivery climbed to a record $1,921.15
an ounce on Sept. 6 and traded at $1,660 by 4:09 p.m. in
 London . The metal is up 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
