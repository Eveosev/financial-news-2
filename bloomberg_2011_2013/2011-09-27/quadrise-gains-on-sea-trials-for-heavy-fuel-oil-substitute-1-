Quadrise Fuels International Plc (QFI) 
rose 4 percent in London after saying it signed contracts to
begin trials at sea of its substitute for heavy  fuel oil .  The shares rose 0.25 penny to 6.5 pence as of 11:54 a.m.
local time, bringing their two-day gain to 11 percent.  Tests for its MSAR fuel, a “low-cost alternative” for the
shipping and power generation industries, will be a key step
toward commercialization of the product, the London-based
company said today in a filing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
