The ban on short-selling adopted by
some European countries in a bid to stem market volatility has
helped reduce speculation, according to Giuseppe Vegas, chairman
of Italian stock-market regulator Consob.  The adoption of further measures to regulate credit-default
swaps and exchange-traded funds should also be considered, Vegas
told a news conference in  Rome  today.  Consob will decide by Sept. 30 whether to extend the
temporary ban on short selling, in consultation with European
countries that took the same initiative, Vegas said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
