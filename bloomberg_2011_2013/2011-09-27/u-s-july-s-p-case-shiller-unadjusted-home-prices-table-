The following table shows the change
in the U.S. composite home price index from S&P/Case-Shiller. Bloomberg’s
median yearly percent change, estimated by 28 economists, was -4.4 percent.  NOTE: The S&P/Case-Shiller(R) Home Price Indices are constructed from
nonseasonally adjusted data on sales of individual properties. With this
method, changes in the index are derived only from actual changes in
selling prices of individual properties. Jan. 2000 = 100.  The S&P/Case-Shiller (R) index includes homes of all prices, while
the sample for the OFHEO index is based only on conforming mortgages
which leaves out much of the upper end of the housing market.  The composition of the U.S. metropolitan area captured by each of the
S&P/Case-Shiller(R) Home Price Indices (SPCSIs) is largely based upon the
most recent definitions established by the Office of Management and Budget
in 2003. With the exceptions of  Chicago  (as composed for the S&P/Case-Shiller
Home Price Index, akin to the OMB Chicago “Metropolitan Division”) and  New
York  (as composed for the S&P/Case-Shiller New York Home Price Index, a
variant of the OMB New York “Combined Statistical Area”), these markets are
consistent with what OMB refers to as the “Metropolitan Statistical Area”
(MSA) of each city listed.  For more information on geographic composition
of the SPCSIs, please see
