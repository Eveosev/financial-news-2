UBS AG is “cautious” about
 China ’s stocks in the fourth quarter as economic and earnings
growth slow, and the risk of a double-dip recession in the
global economy rises, said Gao Ting, chief China strategist at
UBS.  China is also unlikely to relax monetary policies, the
strategist said at a briefing in  Shanghai  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
