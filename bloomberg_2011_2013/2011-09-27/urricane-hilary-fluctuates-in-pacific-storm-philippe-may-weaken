Hurricane Hilary weakened today off
 Mexico ’s Pacific coast on a path that may brush the mid-section
of  Baja California  in five days, the National Hurricane Center
said.  Hilary’s winds dropped to 185 kilometers (115 miles) an
hour from 205 kph yesterday, the center said in a web advisory
at 5 a.m. Miami time. The system, a “major” Category 3
hurricane on the 5-step  Saffir-Simpson scale , was 925 kilometers
southwest of the tip of Baja California.  Hilary is forecast to weaken to a depression later this
week on a course that may take the storm over Baja California’s
west coast near Punta Eugenia on Oct. 1, the NHC said.  The center is also monitoring Tropical Storm Philippe far
east of Antigua, which isn’t a threat to land and has 85 kph
winds over the open ocean, as well as the remnants of Tropical
Storm Ophelia, which has a 70 percent chance of re-forming into
a depression or storm east of  Puerto Rico  within two days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
