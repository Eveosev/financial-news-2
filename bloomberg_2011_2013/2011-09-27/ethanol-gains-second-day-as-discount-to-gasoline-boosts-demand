Ethanol futures gained a second day
in  Chicago  as its discount to gasoline widened, making it more
attractive to refiners.  The futures rose two consecutive days for the first time
since Aug. 24 as gasoline outpaced ethanol amid signs of
increased demand and after ConocoPhillips said it will shut its
Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery. Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
dropped to 11.85 cents, the lowest level since Sept. 16.  “You did see the blender margin widen today,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at the Linn Group in Chicago. “That’s probably
encouraging some business as well.”  Denatured ethanol for October delivery climbed 2.8 cents,
or 1.1 percent, to $2.577 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures are headed for the first monthly drop since June
and the largest since October 2008. Prices have risen 0.9
percent this quarter.  Gasoline for October delivery rose 12.61 cents, or 4.9
percent, to settle at $2.6955 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the biggest gain since May 9.  The biofuel’s discount to gasoline at 11.85 cents widened
from about 2 cents yesterday.  In cash-market trading ethanol in Chicago added 6 cents, or
2.3 percent, to $2.625 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel
jumped 5.5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.73, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased 5 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $2.625 a gallon and on the West Coast the additive rose 2
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.77.  Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for each gallon of
ethanol blended into the motor fuel, in addition to profiting
from the spread between the two.  To contact the reporter on this story:
