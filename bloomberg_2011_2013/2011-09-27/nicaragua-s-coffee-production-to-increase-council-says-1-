(Corrects headline, first and third paragraphs to remove
comparisons to International Coffee Organization data in story
published yesterday.)  Nicaragua ’s coffee output in the
year starting Oct. 1 may be 2.25 million bags, the country’s
National Coffee Council said.  The estimate matched projected output this crop year, Luis
Osorio, the council’s technical secretary, said today in a
telephone interview from Managua, Nicaragua. Growers have
increased the use of fertilizer and improved farm maintenance,
he said. The country is the world’s eighth-biggest producer of
arabica beans, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Arabica prices have climbed 32 percent in the past 12
months on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. A bag in Nicaragua
weighs 46 kilograms, or about 100 pounds.  The harvest has started earlier than normal as higher-than-
average temperatures accelerated crop development, Osorio said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
