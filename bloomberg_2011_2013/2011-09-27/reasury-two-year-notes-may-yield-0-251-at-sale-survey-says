The Treasury Department’s $35
billion sale of two-year notes may draw a yield of 0.251
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of nine of the  Federal Reserve ’s 20 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in September 2013, yielded
0.250 percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m. New
York time.  The size of the offering is the same as the past 11 sales
of the two-year maturity after peaking at $44 billion from
October 2009 through April 2010.  Last month’s two-year note sale drew a record low yield of
0.222 percent. The Aug. 23 offering’s bid-to-cover ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 3.44, versus an average of 3.33 for the past 10
auctions.  Indirect bidders, a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 31.6 percent of the notes at the
August sale, compared with an average for the past 10 offerings
of 30.3 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 15.9 percent of
the notes at the last sale, compared with an average of 15.1
percent at the past 10 auctions.  More than $61 billion of maturing two-year securities are
held by the public and the Fed, according to Treasury data:
$57.8 billion by the public and $3.4 billion by the central
bank. Today’s auction is a net paydown of $26.2 billion.  Return for Year  Two-year notes have returned 1.4 percent this year, after
gaining 2.3 percent in 2010, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. They’re underperforming the overall
Treasury market, which has returned 8.8 percent this year.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  Today’s offering is the first of three sales of U.S. notes
this week totaling $99 billion. The Treasury will sell $35
billion of five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion of seven-year
securities on Sept. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
