Ampal-American Israel (AMPL)  Corp. dropped
to the lowest in at least five years after an overnight
explosion on a  gas pipeline  from  Egypt .  The shares declined 3.7 percent to 1.163 shekels at the
4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the lowest since August 2006, when
Bloomberg started tracking the stock.  Ampal owns 12.5 percent of East Mediterranean Gas Co.,
which exports Egyptian gas to  Israel . There was no damage to the
EMG section of the pipeline, which hasn’t carried gas to Israel
since an earlier attack on July 12, Ampal said in a statement to
the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.  Companies with shares in the Leviathan natural gas site in
Israel rose. Avner Oil Exploration LP increased 4.7 percent to
1.70 shekels, its highest close since Sept. 5. Delek Drilling LP
advanced 6.2 percent to 9.48 shekels, the most since August 14.
 Ratio Oil Exploration 1992 LP (RATIL)  gained 8.2 percent to 0.263
shekel, the highest close since Sept. 15.  The Leviathan discovery, along with a separate Tamar field,
together hold an estimated 25 trillion cubic feet, enough to
meet Israel’s domestic needs and even export.  To contact the reporters on this story:
