Australasian Resources Ltd. (ARH) , an
 iron ore  developer controlled by billionaire  Clive Palmer , is in
talks to raise about $1.1 billion to build a mine in Western
Australia. The shares rose the most in more than four years.  Australasian, through its International Minerals Pty unit,
may sell $500 million of high-yield notes through Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, the Brisbane-based company said today in a
statement to the Australian stock exchange. It is also in talks
with a “major trading house” for a $600 million investment in
the mine, it said.  Palmer, who holds 64 percent of Australasian, is seeking to
develop a number of iron ore and coal projects in  Australia ,
including the Balmoral iron ore development covered by the
agreement between Palmer’s Mineralogy Pty and Australasian.  The mining magnate earlier this year withdrew a plan to
list his iron ore and coal company Resourcehouse Ltd. in  Hong
Kong  to help raise funds for projects expected to cost in excess
of $10 billion to build. The Resourcehouse listing plan included
the Balmoral project.  Australasian agreed to an initial accord with Palmer’s
Mineralogy Pty to access 2 billion tons of iron ore for the mine.
China Metallurgical Group Corp. has agreed to raise 75 percent
of the project costs through an export credit from Chinese banks,
the statement said. A study of the development costs is under
way, it said.  Australasian rose 61 percent to 26.5 cents at the 4:10 p.m.
close of Sydney trading, the most since April 16, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
