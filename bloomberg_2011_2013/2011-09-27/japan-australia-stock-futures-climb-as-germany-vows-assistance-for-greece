Japanese and Australian stock
futures gained after Greece made progress in meeting

continued support for the country.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , which depends
on Europe for about a third of its sales, rose 0.2 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,
Australia’s second-biggest lender by market value, climbed 0.5
percent. Those of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No. 1 oil

jumped 1.4 percent after prices for oil and metals increased.
Most ADRs of Japanese companies fell overnight as 921 of the
1,664 companies in the Topix Index prepare to go ex-dividend
today.  “A pause in the yen’s strength and a progress for
supporting Greece will boost the market,” said  Hiroichi Nishi ,
an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.
“Whether to maintain the pause of yen’s appreciation is a key
to boost the shares higher.”  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in

today in  Tokyo , compared with 103.37 at the close of  stock
