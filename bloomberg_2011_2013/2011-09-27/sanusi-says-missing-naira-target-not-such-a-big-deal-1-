Nigerian central bank Governor
Lamido Sanusi said the naira currency’s decline beyond the
bank’s target for the first time isn’t “such a big deal.”  The central bank has been using foreign-currency reserves
to keep the naira within a 3 percentage-point band above or
below 150 naira per dollar at its twice-weekly auctions.
Yesterday’s rate of 155.02 naira broke the band at 3.2 percent
higher.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer declined 0.01
percent to 157.87 naira per dollar today at 2:57 p.m. in
interbank trading in Lagos, a two-year low being its weakest
level since Aug. 18, 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The regulator will “watch the market in the coming days”
to see if the currency remains above the target before taking
action, Sanusi said.  At the last auction on Sept. 26 the central bank sold $350
million, compared with $551.3 million demanded by lenders, at
155.02 naira a dollar after it failed to meet demand for the
22nd straight sale.  Nigeria raised its benchmark  interest rate  on Sept. 19 for
the fifth time this year by 50 basis points to 9.25 percent to
curb inflation and support the naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
