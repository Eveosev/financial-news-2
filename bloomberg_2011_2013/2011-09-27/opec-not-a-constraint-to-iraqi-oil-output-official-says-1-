Iraq  can produce as much as 5
million barrels a day of oil without needing to ask for OPEC’s
permission, as this is a sovereign decision, the chairman of the
Iraqi parliament’s oil and energy committee said.  “I don’t think OPEC is a constraint” to output of such a
level, Adnan Al Janabi said today at the Iraq 2011: Future
Energy conference organized by The Energy Exchange in Istanbul.  Iraq, the only member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries not bound by a production quota, pumped 2.68
million barrels a day in August, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Iraqi crude output rose to 2.81 million barrels a day
on Sept. 18, the highest level since the U.S.-led invasion of
2003, according to the Oil Ministry.  Iraq seeks to boost output to 3 million barrels a day by
the end of this year from 2.4 million barrels in 2010, Oil
Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said on Sept. 11. Hussain al- Shahristani, the deputy prime minister for energy affairs, said
in July that Iraq hopes to boost production to 12 million
barrels a day by 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
