Ireland is “on a good track” with
its deficit-cutting program, said Luxembourg’s  Jean-Claude
Juncker , who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers.  “I really am admiring” Ireland’s progress in its
consolidation measures, Juncker told the European Parliament
today in Strasbourg,  France . “This clearly shows that there is
a way out of the situation different countries are in. Ireland
is on a good track.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
