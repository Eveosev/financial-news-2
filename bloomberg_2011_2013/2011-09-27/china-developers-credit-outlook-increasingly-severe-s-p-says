China  developers’ credit outlook
will be “increasingly severe” amid the government’s efforts to
curb rising home prices,  Standard & Poor’s  said in a report
today.  “The worst isn’t over for China’s real estate
developers,” the credit rating company said. The developers may
have to cut prices as their liquidity positions deteriorate,
according to the report, though the reductions may not
“stimulate” sales as credit lines and policies remain tight,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
