South Korea  is developing
supersonic cruise missiles with a range of more than 500
kilometers (310 miles), bringing most of  North Korea ’s major
military facilities within range, the Korea Times reported,
citing defense officials it didn’t identify.  The new ship-to-surface missiles, named Haeseong II, may be
deployed in 2013, the English-language newspaper said. They are
a supersonic modification of the anti-ship Haeseong I, which was
developed with a range of 150 kilometers in 2003 and has already
been deployed, according to the report.  Officials at South Korea’s defense ministry declined to
comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
