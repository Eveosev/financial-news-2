Middle East oil grades for sale to
 Asia  fell against their benchmark prices on speculation that
demand will drop along with refining profits.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., for loading
in November fell 10 cents to a premium of 28 cents a barrel to
its official selling price, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price earlier this month reached 63 cents over
its official level, the most since May. Qatar Land slipped 10
cents to a premium of 17 cents a barrel, Bloomberg data showed.  A decline in processing margins has limited demand for
crude that helped push up premiums earlier in September.
Gasoilâ€™s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of profit, fell today
to $15.52 a barrel, compared with $17.72 a month ago, according
to London-based broker PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Oman crude for immediate loading gained $3.57, or 3.6
percent, to $103.85 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in November increased 3.6 percent to $103.47. Murban
for spot delivery climbed 3.3 percent to $107.78.  Oman futures for November delivery rose $2.35 to $104.50 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:48 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,392 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$104.39 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The November Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
rose 2 cents to $4.35 a barrel, according to data from PVM. The
exchange for swaps for December fell 1 cent to $3.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
