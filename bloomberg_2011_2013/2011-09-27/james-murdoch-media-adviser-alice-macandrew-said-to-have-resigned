News Corp. (NWSA) ’s head of communications
for  Europe , who helped direct strategy for James Murdoch during
the U.K. phone-hacking scandal, will leave before the Christmas
holiday, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.  Alice Macandrew gave her notice in July, the month News
Corp. was forced to shut the News of the World tabloid amid
allegations that reporters had hacked into the phone of murdered
schoolgirl  Milly Dowler , said the person, who could not be named
because the decision isn’t public. Miranda Higham, a spokeswoman
for News Corp., declined to comment.  Macandrew joined News Corp. in 2009. She already worked
with James Murdoch when he was chief executive officer of
British Sky Broadcasting Corp. and she worked for public
relations company Finsbury.  James Murdoch  joined News Corp.’s
U.K. newspaper unit News International as chairman in December
2007, after the hacking took place.  Murdoch has been compelled to appear in July before a U.K.
Parliamentary committee to explain how much he knew about the
hacking at the News of the World and what he did to investigate
it. The police investigation has lead to at least 16 arrests and
the resignation of former News International CEO Rebekah Brooks.  The Financial Times reported Macandrew’s resignation
earlier.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
News Corp. units in providing financial news and information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
