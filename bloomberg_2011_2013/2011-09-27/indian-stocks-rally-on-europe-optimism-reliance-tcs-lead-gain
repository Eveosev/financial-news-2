Indian stocks ended four days of
declines, helping the benchmark index post its biggest gain in a
month, as European leaders discussed plans to ease the region’s
debt crisis.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the nation’s largest company by
market value, surged the most since Nov. 2009.  Tata Consultancy
Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software services provider, advanced
4.7 percent after saying it’s weighing acquisitions in France,
Germany,  Japan  and the U.S. as it sees a further rise in demand
even amid global economic woes. Equities worldwide rallied as
the  European Central Bank  was said to be considering restarting
covered-bond purchases and further measures to ease monetary
conditions.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , which last year got 35 percent of
its revenue from the U.S. and  Europe , rallied 6.6 percent.  The BSE India Sensitive Index, or Sensex, climbed 472.80,
or 3 percent, to 16,523.90, according to preliminary closing
prices as of 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, its biggest gain since Aug.
29. The gauge plunged 6.1 percent in the past four sessions. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
jumped 2.8 percent to 4,971.25. The BSE-200 Index gained 2.5
percent to 2,045.82.  To contact the reporter on this story:
