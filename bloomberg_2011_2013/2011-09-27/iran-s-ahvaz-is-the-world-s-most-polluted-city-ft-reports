Ahvaz, a city in southwest  Iran , is
the world’s most polluted city, with the highest measured level
of airborne particles smaller than 10 micrometers, according to
a global survey of reported data by the World Health
Organization, the Financial Times reported.  Ahvaz had an annual average of 372 micrograms of such
particles per cubic meter, followed by  Ulan Bator , the capital
of Mongolia, with 279 micrograms and another Iranian city,
Sanandaj, with 254; cities in Pakistan and India, such as Quetta
and Kanpur, were high on the list, as was Gaborone, the capital
of Botswana, the newspaper said.  By contrast Washington D.C. has a level of 18 micrograms,
Tokyo 23 and Paris 38, the FT said.  The WHO, which collected figures for almost 1,100 cities,
recommends an upper limit of 20 micrograms, the FT said, adding
that the main pollutants are sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide
from  power plants , vehicle exhausts and industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
