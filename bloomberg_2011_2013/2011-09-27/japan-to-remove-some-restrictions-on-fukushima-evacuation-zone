Japan ’s government may lift
restrictions this week on some areas outside the exclusion zone
around the crippled Fukushima nuclear where residents had been
told to prepare for evacuation.  The so-called Emergency Evacuation Preparation Zone was set
up in April for areas 10 kilometers beyond the 20 kilometer
(12.6 mile) no-go zone. The area includes five cities, towns and
villages where residents were allowed to stay after the nuclear
accident on the condition they were prepared to evacuate at any
time if radiation levels spiked.  “I plan to take measures to lift the Emergency Evacuation
Preparation Zone this week if possible,” said  Goshi Hosono ,
Japan’s minister in charge of the response to the nuclear
crisis, in the Diet today.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant has
been leaking radiation since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami
knocked out cooling, causing three reactors to meltdown and
forcing 160,000 people to flee their homes.  “The government may be easing restrictions because concern
about reactor explosions has diminished,” Tetsuji Imanaka,
professor of nuclear engineering in  Kyoto University , said by
phone today. “Radiation contamination of the land hasn’t
decreased so far.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
