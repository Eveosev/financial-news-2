Mesoblast Ltd. (MSB) , the world’s largest
developer of stem-cell treatments, will form a manufacturing
alliance with  Lonza Group AG (LONN)  as it prepares to mass-produce its
regenerative therapies.  Under the agreement, Mesoblast can instruct Basel,
Switzerland-based Lonza to build a dedicated manufacturing plant
for its products in exchange for buying “agreed quantities” of
those items, the companies said in a joint statement today.  Mesoblast’s experimental spinal and heart failure treatments
are in the final of three stages of patient studies usually
required by regulators. The Melbourne-based company has more
than tripled over the past 12 months, making it the best
performing stock on  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index. Lonza is the
world’s biggest maker of drug ingredients and also offers
contract manufacturing for pharmaceutical companies.  “It means that we as a company have taken out the entire
risk of the manufacturing by shifting it” to Lonza, Mesoblast
Chief Executive Officer Silviu Itescu said in an interview. The
alliance would guarantee long-term supply of its products,
according to the statement.  Mesoblast gained as much as 5.3 percent on the Australian
Stock Exchange today. The stock traded at 4.5 percent higher at
A$7.94 at 10:31 a.m. Sydney time.  Lonza is planning a secondary listing on the Singapore
Stock Exchange in the fourth quarter of 2011, the Swiss company
said on Sept. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
