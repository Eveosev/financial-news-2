Slovakia’s central bank expects the
economy in the second-poorest euro-area member to grow slower
than previously predicted, citing  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The bank sees the economy expanding 3.4 percent this year,
down from 3.6 percent predicted three months ago, Renata Konecna, the director of the central bank’s monetary department,
said at a news conference in Bratislava, Slovakia, today. The
bank also revised its growth forecast for 2012 to 3.8 percent
from 4.7 percent, while the prediction for 2013 was lowered to
5.1 percent from 5.3 percent.  Average inflation will reach 4.2 percent in 2011, compared
with a previous forecast of 4.1 percent, slowing to 3 percent in
2012 and 2.4 percent in 2013.  Austerity measures in Europe designed to lower debts and
deficits are set to slow growth across the continent. The crisis
is hurting Slovakia, a euro member since 2009, as it relies on
foreign demand for its products, such as cars assembled by a
Volkswagen AG’s Slovak unit, to drive the economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
