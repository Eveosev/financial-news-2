LLX Logistica SA (LLXL3) , the port company
controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , is in
“advanced negotiations” with oil companies to use an offshore
crude terminal and an oil treatment plant at the Acu port.  LLX will finish building an offshore terminal capable of
handling 1.2 million barrels a day of oil by the end of 2012,
Rodrigo Falco Lopes, the company’s commercial manager, said
today in an interview from Rio de Janeiro. The plant capable of
removing water and salt from oil will be completed in the first
half of 2013, he said.  Batista, the world’s eighth-richest man according to
Forbes magazine, plans to ship iron ore, steel, oil and cars
from his companies and joint ventures through Acu to China.
Lopes declined to identify the  oil companies , citing
confidentiality agreements.  LLX rose 3 centavos, or 0.8 percent, to 3.70 reais in Sao
Paulo trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
