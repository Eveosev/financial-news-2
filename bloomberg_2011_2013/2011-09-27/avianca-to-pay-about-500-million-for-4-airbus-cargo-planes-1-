Avianca Taca Holding SA will pay
about $500 million for four Airbus SAS cargo planes as the owner
of  Colombia ’s largest airline by sales positions itself for a
U.S. approval of a free trade accord with the South American
nation, said Chief Executive Officer Fabio Villegas.  Avianca’s Tampa Cargo SA unit will begin using the Airbus
A330-200F planes in December 2012, Villegas told reporters today
in Bogota. Avianca shares rose 1.9 percent to 4,505 pesos at
3:02 p.m.  New York  time.  Avianca began renting this month a Boeing 767-300 F-ER as
the company seeks to boost cargo sales and profits by opening
new routes including flights between  Los Angeles  and Montevideo,
Uruguay, and between New York and Santiago, Chile, Villegas
said. The company’s cargo fleet also includes four 767-200SF-ER
made by  Boeing Co. (BA)   “We now have the capacity to serve the whole American
continent,” said Victor Mejia Rivas, Avianca’s vice president
of cargo.  It is “very possible” that Avianca will make an
acquisition in the region within the next three years aimed at
expanding its cargo business, Rivas told Bloomberg News, without
giving further details.  The Airbus planes will allow the company, which has a Miami
cargo hub, to maintain or increase its 35 percent market share
of Colombian aerial exports to the U.S., Rivas said. Flowers
account for about 70 percent of Colombia’s exports via air to
the U.S. by volume, Rivas said.  Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  said on Sept. 22 he
expects U.S. lawmakers will approve the proposed free trade pact
with Colombia by mid-October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
