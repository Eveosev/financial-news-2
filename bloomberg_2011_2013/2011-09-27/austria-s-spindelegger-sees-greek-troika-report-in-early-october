Austria’s Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger expects a report on Greece from the so-called
called Troika of the  International Monetary Fund ,  European
Central Bank  and European Commission in early October.  “Everything we hear before then is rumors, I want to see”
the report, Spindelegger, who also is the country’s vice
chancellor, told reporters in Vienna today at a joint briefing
with Chancellor Werner Faymann.  “If the conditions are not met, there is a new scenario
that we have to adjust to, but it doesn’t make sense” to
explore hypothetical scenarios at this stage, he said. “This
only leads to uncertainty in the markets.”  Chancellor Faymann said that he expects Greece to manage
what it aiming for and doesn’t see Greece being expelled from
the euro area.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
