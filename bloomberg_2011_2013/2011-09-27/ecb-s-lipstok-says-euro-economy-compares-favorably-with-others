European Central Bank Governing
Council member  Andres Lipstok  said critics of  Europe  should be
aware that the single currency area’s economic performance
compares favorably with other advanced nations.  “When criticizing Europe, it is worth to bear in mind that
the key indicators of the euro-area economy and public finances
compared to other advanced industrial countries are the same, if
not better off,” Lipstok, who is the governor of Estonia’s
central bank, said in an opinion article published in Aeripaeev
newspaper. “This is despite the fact that the decision-making
process in Europe somewhat differs from that of the United
States, because the primary goal is always finding a common
ground.”  Lipstok added that the ECB provides enough liquidity for
stable economic development, and that  price stability  is “the
best central banks can do to secure long-term economic growth.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
