Rising health-care costs,
especially Medicaid, are set to become the biggest challenge for
U.S. state budgets and may eclipse education spending over the
next decade,  Fitch Ratings  said.  Federal spending cuts and implementation of the 2010
health-care bill will represent “a major concern for states,”
Fitch said in a report today.  Medicaid is likely to be a target of the congressional
supercommittee charged with finding $1.2 trillion in budget
cuts, the ratings company said in a Sept. 21 report. Medicaid
represents the biggest share of federal aid to states, according
to Fitch.  President  Barack Obama ’s 2009 stimulus program cushioned
state budgets from increasing enrollment and costs for Medicaid,
the health-insurance program for the poor, Fitch said. From
October 2008 to June of this year, the legislation provided an
estimated $103 billion to the states. The funds helped offset
$50 billion in increased costs associated with an additional 6
million Medicaid participants, Fitch said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
