Brazil’s government is preparing
the country for a Greek default as early as this week,  Valor
Economico  reported, citing an unidentified government official.  President  Dilma Rousseff  and Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
got back from the U.S. this weekend more pessimistic about the
global crisis after meeting with foreign officials and business
leaders, the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  The government may adopt new economic measures to shield
the country if the crisis worsens, according to the newspaper.  Brazil’s Presidential Palace and Finance Ministry didn’t
immediately return calls and e-mails from Bloomberg News seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
