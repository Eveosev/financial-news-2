peacekeepers fired teargas and rubber bullets at local Serbs in
the north of  Kosovo  after the forces were hampered in their
operation to dismantle roadblocks and clear access to a
checkpoint toward Serbia, Serbian state television RTS reported.  U.S. members of NATO’s operation in Kosovo, also known as
KFOR, fired rubber bullets today after Serbs, who had kept the
road blocked, interfered with the dismantling and threw stones
at them. RTS reported seven civilians and four KFOR troops were
wounded.  Tensions escalated ahead of a new round of European Union-
sponsored talks between Serbia and Kosovo aimed at finding
solutions to ease ordinary people’s lives.  Kosovo ended a trade embargo on products from Serbia
earlier this month trying to ease tensions between the two
Balkan nations, after imposing the trade ban on goods from
 Serbia  in July. It also sent special police forces to the Serb-
dominated north of the country to assert authority over its
entire territory three years after declaring independence from
Serbia.  Serbia and Kosovo on Sept. 2 struck an agreement on
“status-neutral” documents. Serbia needs to show it’s making
efforts to improve relations with its former province as it aims
to win EU candidate status by year’s end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
