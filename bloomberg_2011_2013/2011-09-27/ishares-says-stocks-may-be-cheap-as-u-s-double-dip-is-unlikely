Equities look inexpensive as recent
declines can only be justified by a worldwide recession, said
Russ Koesterich, the San Francisco-based global chief investment
strategist for the IShares unit of  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)   “We’re looking at slow growth not negative growth,”
Koesterich said in a video conference transmitted to a media
briefing in Sydney. IShares doesn’t expect a  double-dip  U.S.
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
