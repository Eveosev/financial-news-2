Walgreen Co. (WAG) , the largest U.S.
drugstore chain, said failure to renew a contract to provide
prescriptions for  Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) ’s customers will reduce
its fiscal 2012 earnings. Walgreen shares fell.  Losing 75 percent of sales through Express Scripts would
lower profit by 21 cents a share for the year, Chief Financial
Officer Wade Miquelon said today on a conference call to discuss
fourth-quarter earnings. Profit will decline 14 cents if
Walgreen loses half of the sales and 7 cents from 25 percent of
the sales, he said. Analysts project 2012 profit of $2.98 a
share, the average of 24 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Walgreen said today it’s made “no substantial progress”
in negotiating a renewal of the contract with  Express Scripts , a
manager of drug benefits for corporations, unions and other
employers. The contract, worth more than $5 billion in annual
drug sales, expires at the end of the year.  “Investor focus will remain on the unresolved Express
Scripts contract,” John Heinbockel, an analyst at Guggenheim
Securities LLC in  New York , wrote today in a note. He rates the
shares as “buy” and predicts the Express Scripts dispute will
be resolved amicably.  Walgreen declined $2.26, or 6.3 percent, to $33.77 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Express
Scripts rose 36 cents to $39.68 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  Quarterly Profit  Chief Executive Officer Greg Wasson said some of the
companies and employees it serves through St Louis-based Express
Scripts want to maintain their relationship with Walgreen.  “We are planning not to be part of the Express Scripts
network as of the first of the year,” Wasson said today on the
conference call.  Net income for the quarter ended Aug. 31 rose 69 percent to
$792 million, or 87 cents a share, from $470 million, or 49
cents, a year earlier, the Deerfield, Illinois-based company
said today in a statement. Profit excluding a gain from the sale
of Walgreens Health Initiatives was 57 cents. Analysts projected
55 cents, the average of 22 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Total revenue in the fourth quarter rose 6.5 percent to $18
billion, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
