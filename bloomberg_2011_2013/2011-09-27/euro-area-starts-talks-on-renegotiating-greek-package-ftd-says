Euro-area members have started
talks on renegotiating the second aid package for  Greece  that
was agreed on in July, Financial Times Deutschland reported,
citing unidentified people familiar with the discussions.  Banks and insurance companies could have to increase their
contribution to the rescue package as Greeceâ€™s economy has
deteriorated, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
