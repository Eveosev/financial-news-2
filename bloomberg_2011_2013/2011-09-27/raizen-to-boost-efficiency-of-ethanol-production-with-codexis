Raizen Energia SA,  Brazil ’s largest
sugar-cane miller, will use biotechnology developed by  Codexis
Inc. (CDXS)  to make its ethanol production process more efficient.  The companies expect to develop a pilot project at Raizen’s
Bonfim mill in  Sao Paulo  state, Redwood City-based Codexis said
today in a statement. Raizen produced 600 million gallons (2.3
billion liters) of ethanol in 2010, about 8.6 percent of total
production in Brazil, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
