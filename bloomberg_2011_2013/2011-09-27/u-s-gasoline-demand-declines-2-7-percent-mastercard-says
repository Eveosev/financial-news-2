U.S. gasoline consumption slid 2.7
percent from a year earlier as higher pump prices crimped fuel
demand, according to  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Motorists bought 8.73 million barrels a day in the week
ended Sept. 23, the second-biggest payments network company said
in its SpendingPulse report. That’s down from 8.98 million a
year earlier and 8.91 million the previous week.  The average pump price fell 6 cents to $3.56 a gallon, 31
percent higher than a year earlier.  “Year-over-year declines in gasoline consumption persist
under elevated prices at the pump as well as economic
uncertainty,” John Gamel, a gasoline analyst and director of
economic analysis for SpendingPulse, said in the report.  Averaged over four weeks, gasoline use was 2.9 percent
below a year earlier. It was the 27th week in a row that demand
fell on that basis, according to SpendingPulse data.  Fuel consumption in the period ended Sept. 23 was down 2
percent from the prior week.  Gasoline demand peaked this year at 9.56 million barrels a
day in the week ended July 1 as motorists filled their tanks
before the July 4 holiday weekend. The lowest level of
consumption occurred in the week ended Feb. 11 when consumers
bought 8.47 million barrels a day.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
