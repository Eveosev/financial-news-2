Robert Shiller, an economics 
professor at Yale University and co-creator of the 
S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index, talks about the U.S. housing 
market and economy.  The S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities 
fell 4.1 percent from July 2010, after a revised 4.4 percent 
drop in the 12 months to June. Shiller speaks with Carol Massar 
and Adam Johnson on Bloomberg Television's "Street Smart."
