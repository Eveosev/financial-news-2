Chinese industrial companies’
profits rose 28.2 percent in the first eight months of 2011 from
a year earlier, aiding the expansion of the world’s second-
biggest economy.  Net income climbed to 3.2 trillion yuan ($500 billion), the
National Bureau of Statistics said on its website today. The
rise compared with a 28.3 percent increase from January through
July.  Rising profits may help support investment and sustain
growth as the world’s largest exporting nation faces weakening
demand because of Europe’s debt crisis and a faltering U.S.
recovery. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that  China’s
economy  will expand 9.5 percent this year, lower than a June
estimate of 9.6 percent.  “Profit growth is likely to slow down going forward, given
the weakening growth momentum,” said Zhang Zhiwei, chief China
economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. in  Hong Kong . Decreased
overseas demand for Chinese products and government measures to
cool the  property market  will weigh on the economy, he said.  The bureau’s profit data cover companies with annual core
revenue of at least 20 million yuan in 39 industries, including
oil and gas exploration, transportation equipment manufacturing,
telecommunications and power generation.  Industrial companies’ revenue rose 29.9 percent to 53.2
trillion yuan in the eight months through August, according to
today’s statement. Revenue was 45.9 trillion yuan for the first
seven months of this year.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co.,  China ’s biggest publicly traded
steelmaker, said last month that its first-half profit dropped
37 percent because of slowing demand from automakers and rising
prices of  iron ore  and coal.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
