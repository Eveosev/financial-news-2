Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, rose the most in six weeks in Sao Paulo trading
after proposing to boost its 2011 dividend by $1 billion.  Vale’s preferred shares increased as much as 3.3 percent to
41.85 centavos, the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 11. They
were at 41.38 centavos as of 10:15 a.m. New York time. The stock
fell 16 percent this year through yesterday, less than the 23
percent decline for  Brazil ’s benchmark Bovespa index.  Vale plans to return as much as $12 billion to its
shareholders this year, including $9 billion in dividends and a
$3 billion stock buyback, it said in a regulatory filing
yesterday. The dividend payment is the biggest ever by the Rio
de Janeiro-based company and is three times last year’s $3
billion payment, Vale said.  The dividend increase “illustrates the company’s efforts
to show capital discipline in any way it can,” Rene Kleyweg and
Marcelo Zilberberg, analysts at UBS AG in  London , wrote in a
report today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
