Poland has no plans now to cut its
budget forecast of 4 percent economic growth next year and there
is no danger the public debt will exceed a legal limit set at 55
percent of gross domestic product, Finance Minister Jacek
Rostowski said today in an interview on RMF FM.  Rostowski said next year’s budget is “safe” even if
economic growth were to slow to 3 percent because nominal GDP
and tax revenues in 2012 will be increased by above-forecast
inflation and economic growth this year.  The government is prepared to reduce its forecasts and
adjust next year’s budget if conditions require it, Rostowski
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
