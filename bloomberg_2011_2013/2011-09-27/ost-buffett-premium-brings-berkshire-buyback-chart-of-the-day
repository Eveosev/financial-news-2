Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) ’s about-
face on buying back stock is an acknowledgment that the shares
have lost much of their so-called Buffett premium even as the
company has piled up cash.  The CHART OF THE DAY contrasts Berkshire’s stock price as a
percentage of book value, or the value of its assets after
subtracting debt and other liabilities, with the amount of cash
on hand.  Berkshire, run by billionaire investor  Warren Buffett ,
changed hands for 82 percent more than the book value of each
share at the end of 2007. The premium narrowed to 1.3 percent
last week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The repurchase plan calls for the Omaha, Nebraska-based
company, which had previously shunned buybacks during Buffett’s
tenure, to pay no more than a 10 percent premium to book value.
Berkshire also said it would avoid any repurchases that reduced
the company’s cash to less than $20 billion, a figure surpassed
since 2003, when the chart begins.  Berkshire had $47.9 billion of cash at the end of this
year’s second quarter. The total exceeded the company’s previous
peak of $47.8 billion, set six years earlier, and amounted to an
87 percent surge since the end of March 2010.  Berkshire spent $9 billion in cash to buy Lubrizol Corp.,
an engine-additive maker, earlier this month. The company is due
to receive $3.3 billion on Oct. 17, when General Electric Co.
buys back preferred shares sold three years earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
