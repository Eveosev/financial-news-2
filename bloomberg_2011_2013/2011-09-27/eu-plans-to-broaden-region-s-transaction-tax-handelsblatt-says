The European Commission plans to
extend a planned tax on financial transactions to all trades in
which European countries are involved, Handelsblatt reported,
citing a draft of the European Union directives on the tax.  Third-party banks that are not domiciled in the EU will
also be required to pay the tax when they execute transactions
on behalf of European clients, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
