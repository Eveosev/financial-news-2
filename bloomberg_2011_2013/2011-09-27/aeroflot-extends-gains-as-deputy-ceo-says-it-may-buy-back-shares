OAO Aeroflot extended gains as
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Shamil Kurmashov said Russia’s
largest airline may buy back shares after prices declined.  The stock advanced 3.6 percent to 50.82 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the biggest gain since Sept. 7.  “We’re considering a buyback,” Kurmashov said. “The
price levels are attractive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
