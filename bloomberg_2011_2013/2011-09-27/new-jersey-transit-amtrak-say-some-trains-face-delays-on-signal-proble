New Jersey Transit  and Amtrak said
trains traveling from  New York  to New Jersey face delays of at
least an hour because of switch and signal problems.  New Jersey Transit said all trains running through Newark
Penn Station are two hours behind schedule.  Amtrak also reported 60 minute to 90 minute delays between
New York Penn Station and Newark. Amtrak technicians are working
on repairs to the system, with no estimate for restoration.  The two agencies commented in separate e-mailed statements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
