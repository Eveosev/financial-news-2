Colcap Index gained 0.6 percent to 1,593.65.  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA CB), the owner of
 Colombia ’s largest airline, rose 1.9 percent to 4,505 pesos.  The company ordered four A330-200F cargo planes from Airbus
SAS for about $500 million, which it will begin using as of
December 2012, Chief Executive Officer Fabio Villegas told
reporters in Bogota today.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE)  , the Calgary-based  oil
company  that operates fields in  South America , surged after the
company said its oil reserves increased 73 percent from a year
ago at its Rancho Hermoso and Entrerrios fields.  Canacol shares rose 15 percent, the most since shares began
trading in Bogota in July 2010, to 1,265 pesos, snapping a 10-
day decline. The company said proved reserves in the fiscal year
that ended June 30 were 4.5 million barrels, compared to 2.6
million barrels the year before, according to a statement on its
website.  “After the company’s reserves increased, investors started
seeing that the share’s correction may have been excessive,”
said Mauricio Restrepo del Toro, analyst at brokerage Bolsa y
Renta. “Now people are a little more calm.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
