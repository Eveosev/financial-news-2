MillerCoors LLC, the beer maker,
claims in a lawsuit that the  New England Patriots  football team
reneged on an exclusive sponsorship contract to “pursue a more
lucrative exclusive agreement” with Anheuser-Busch InBev NV.  A copy of yesterday’s complaint in Massachusetts state
court was provided by MillerCoors. The filing couldn’t be
confirmed independently with the court.  “We negotiated in good faith with the New England Patriots
for several months, at their invitation, to become their
exclusive and official beer partner after several years of a
shared deal,” Pete Marino, a MillerCoors spokesman, said in an
e-mailed statement. “Regrettably the team has now reneged on
the deal that was reached, and we are left with no choice but to
take legal action and ask the courts to uphold the integrity of
our binding legal agreement.”  MillerCoors has been an official beer sponsor of the
National Football League team for almost 10 years, according to
the complaint. The current sponsorship deal expires in February.  ``I have not seen any complaint or official filing yet, so I wouldn’t be
comfortable offering any comment,'' Dan Goldberg, a lawyer for the Patriots,
said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
