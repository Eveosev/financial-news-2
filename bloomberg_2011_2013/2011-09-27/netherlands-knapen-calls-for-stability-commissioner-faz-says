Ben Knapen , the Dutch minister for
European affairs and international cooperation, said European
Union governments should consider creating a stability
commission,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported.  The stability commissioner should have powers similar to
those of the competition commissioner to ensure that member
states adhere to budget rules, Knapen told the German newspaper
in an interview published today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
