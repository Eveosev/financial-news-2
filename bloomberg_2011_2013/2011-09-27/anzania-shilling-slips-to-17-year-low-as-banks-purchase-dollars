Tanzania’s shilling dropped to the
weakest in at least 17 years against the dollar as commercial
banks purchased the greenback on concern the rate will
depreciate further.  The currency of  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy
dropped as much as 0.6 percent at 1,683.5 per dollar, the lowest
intraday level since at least October 1994, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It traded down 0.4 percent at 1,680 by
12:05 p.m. in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital.  “Commercial banks panicked” since the shilling passed
1,640 per dollar on Sept. 22 “and have been buying dollars not
necessarily on client orders, but to stock up because we don’t
know what will happen next,” Yonoh Mtengule, chief economist at
National Bank of Commerce Ltd., Absa Group Ltd.’s Tanzanian
unit, said by phone from Dar es Salaam.  Tanzania’s inflation rate climbed to 14.1 percent in August
on higher food costs, the National Bureau of Statistics said
Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
