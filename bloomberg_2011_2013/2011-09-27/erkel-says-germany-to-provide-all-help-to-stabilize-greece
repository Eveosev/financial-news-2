Germany  will provide all help it
can to stabilize Greece,  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said.  The priority is that markets regain confidence in Greece,
Merkel said in a speech to a German industry federation event in
Berlin today.  “Whatever Germany can offer in terms of help, we will
offer,” she said. “We do this in a spirit of friendship, a
spirit of partnership, not in a spirit of imposing something.”  Merkel urged German lawmakers to back an enhancement of the
euro rescue fund in a vote in two days.  “If Europe isn’t doing well, then over the middle term
Germany won’t do well,” Merkel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
