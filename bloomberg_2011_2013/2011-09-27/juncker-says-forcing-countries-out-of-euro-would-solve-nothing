Luxembourgâ€™s  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
who leads the group of euro-area finance ministers, said forcing
countries out of the single-currency region would solve nothing
and would carry major risks both for the countries themselves
and for the remaining euro countries. He spoke to the European
Parliament in Strasbourg,  France , today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
