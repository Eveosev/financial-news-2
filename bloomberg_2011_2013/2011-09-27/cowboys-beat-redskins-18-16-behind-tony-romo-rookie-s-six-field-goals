The  Dallas Cowboys  rallied past the
Washington Redskins 18-16 as quarterback Tony Romo, playing
eight days after suffering a fractured rib that punctured one of
his lungs, led the winning drive in the final minutes.  Rookie Dan Bailey kicked six field goals for Dallas,
including a 40-yarder with one minute, 47 seconds left at
Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. The kick came after Romo,
who passed for 255 yards, completed a 30-yard pass to
Washington’s 25-yard line on a 3rd-and-21 play.  The Cowboys forced a fumble by Redskins quarterback Rex Grossman with 28 seconds left to improve their record to 2-1 and
prevent the Redskins from starting 3-0 for the first time since
the 2005 National Football League season.  “We’re lucky to come out of here with a win,” said Romo,
who overcame bad snaps and incorrect routes run by his receivers.
“We had a million mistakes tonight.”  The Cowboys have played nine straight games that have been
decided by three points or less, an NFL record.  After three field goals by each team in the first half, Tim Hightower scored the only touchdown with four minutes remaining
in the third quarter. Hightower caught a 1-yard pass from
Grossman that gave the Redskins a 16-9 lead.  Bailey then added three more field goals to give the
Cowboys their fifth win in six meetings with their National
Football Conference East division rivals. The Cowboys hold a 61-
38-2 advantage in the all-time regular-season series.  Dallas,  Washington  and the New York Giants are tied atop
the division at 2-1, while the  Philadelphia Eagles  are 1-2.  Washington’s loss leaves the  Green Bay Packers ,  Detroit
Lions  and  Buffalo Bills  as the only undefeated teams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
