Peru’s sol rose from a three-month
low as speculation European leaders are closer to agreeing on
ways to control the region’s sovereign-debt crisis spurred
demand for higher yielding, emerging-market assets.  The sol strengthened 0.2 percent at 2.7665 per  U.S. dollar 
at 11:19 a.m. New York time, from 2.7716 yesterday.  Policy makers in Europe now understand the severity of the
debt crisis and the actions that need to be taken, Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive and co-investment officer of Pacific
Investment Management Co., the world’s biggest manager of bond
funds, said in a Bloomberg radio interview today. Euro-region
finance chiefs from the Group of 20 nations, meeting in
 Washington  on Sept. 22, committed to boost the flexibility of
their rescue fund before the next G-20 meeting Oct. 3.  “As the uncertainty begins to clear and positive news
emerges, we should see the sol strengthening,” said  Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru in  Lima . “The
fundamentals of the Peruvian economy remain sound.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.81 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
