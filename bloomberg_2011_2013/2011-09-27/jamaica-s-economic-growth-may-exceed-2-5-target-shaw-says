Jamaica’s economic growth will
probably exceed 2.5 percent this year and next as the Caribbean
island fosters investment, Finance Minister Audley Shaw said.  “I am quite optimistic that our growth will exceed the 2
percent to 2.5 percent near-term projections that we have,”
Shaw said in an interview at Bloomberg headquarters in  New York .  Jamaica is working to attract investments in areas such as
tourism and information and communications technology, Shaw
said. Parliament approved this year a law allowing the expansion
of casinos on the island nation.  “Despite the challenges of the global economy, there is
money and what we have got to do is to build a platform of
credibility that can attract that money,” Shaw said.  Jamaica’s economy expanded 1.4 percent in the first quarter
from the year-earlier period. Inflation should end the year
between 6 percent and 6.5 percent, Shaw said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
