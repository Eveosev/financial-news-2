Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR)  advanced the
most in almost two weeks after the developer of the world’s
tallest tower in Dubai had its outlook revised to stable from
negative at  Standard & Poor’s .  The shares jumped 1.1 percent, the most since Sept. 14, to
2.79 dirhams at 10:04 a.m. in Dubai.  The rating was affirmed at BB. “The outlook is stable
because we see recurring cash flow generation from leasing
activities and improving performance of Emaar’s hospitality
assets, which offsets uncertainties in international development
activities,” the rating company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
