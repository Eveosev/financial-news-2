A slump in  gold prices  from a
record will fuel demand for the precious metal before a festival
season in  India , the world’s largest consumer, according to the
nation’s biggest jewelry retailer.  “The price has come down, and there has been a rush in
demand in the last two to three days,” Bhaskar Bhat, managing
director of  Titan Industries Ltd. (TTAN) , said in an interview to
Bloomberg UTV today.  Immediate-delivery gold declined 8.8 percent in the three
days before today, the biggest three-day drop since the failure
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, as some investors sold
the metal to cover losses in other markets, which plunged on
concern that the global economy may lapse into recession. A
recovery in Indian demand may help gold extend its 16 percent
rally this year.  “Everyone is a buyer now, and the investment demand is
huge,” Prithviraj Kothari, president of the Bombay Bullion
Association said in an interview. “Before the fall in prices,
the showrooms were empty, and now there are queues for
purchasing gold coins and bars.”  Gold for immediate delivery climbed $27.58 or 1.7 percent,
to $1,653.93 an ounce at 12:05 p.m. in Mumbai. It rose to a
record $1,921.15 on Sept. 6. December-delivery bullion surged as
much as 4.1 percent to $1,660.20 an ounce in  New York  before
trading at $1,655.40.  A better-than-expected monsoon may push up rural incomes
and boost India’s gold imports by more than 4 percent to 1,000
metric tons this year, Kothari said on Sept. 20.  Wedding Season  “Imports during the second half of 2011 will be around 500
tons,” he said today. Purchases in the first half were about
550 tons, he said.  Gold demand in India peaks during the festival season,
which started with Eid last month and ends in October with
Diwali, and is followed by the traditional wedding season.
Demand for coins and bars are also rising as investors seek a
haven against inflation.  Investment demand for gold in India jumped 78 percent to
108.5 tons in the three months ended June 30, the second-highest
quarter on record, according to the World Gold Council.
Consumption rose to a record 963.1 tons last year, driving
imports to the highest level ever at 958 tons, according to the
council.  The decline in gold prices has made the precious metal more
attractive to investors “as other alternatives are not as
attractive,” Titan’s Bhat said.  Bullion is heading for its 11th annual gain as  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis and concern that the  U.S. economy  may be
slowing spur demand for a haven. Gold will climb to a record
$2,038 an ounce by year-end, according to the average estimate
of 16 respondents in a Bloomberg survey conducted at a London
Bullion Market Association conference in  Montreal  this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
