German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said that Greece is ready to meet the terms of international
inspectors ruling on its bailout aid, voicing her government’s
support for the debt-laden nation’s economic success.  “We want a strong Greece in the euro area and Germany is
ready to offer all kinds of help that is needed,” Merkel said
before hosting Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  for dinner
in Berlin today. Greece has a “high responsibility to meet the
conditions and expectations.”  Merkel, who joined Papandreou at a German industry
association conference in the German capital earlier today, said
“I have heard so far that Greece is ready to meet the
conditions” set by the International Monetary Fund, the
 European Central Bank  and the European Commission. “We will
discuss in great detail how we can be of help here.” Merkel
said her government and German industry “wish Greece success on
the difficult path it is pursuing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
