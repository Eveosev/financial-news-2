Norwegian export-oriented companies
are showing less demand for loans due to the strong krone,
Dagens Naeringsliv reported, citing Gunn Waersted, head of
 Nordea Bank AB (NDA) ’s operations in  Norway .  Many companies are delaying investments they otherwise
would have undertaken due to increased uncertainty in the
markets, the Oslo-based newspaper said.  While Nordea doesn’t hold government debt from Portugal,
Italy, Ireland, Greece or Spain, it’s difficult to predict how
banks will be indirectly affected by a worsening crisis, the
newspaper quoted the executive as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
