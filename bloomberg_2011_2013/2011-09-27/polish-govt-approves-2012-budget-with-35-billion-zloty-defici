The Polish government approved next
year’s budget, saying the ratio of public debt to gross domestic
product would be higher than previously expected.  Public debt will reach 53.8 percent of GDP this year,
compared with an estimate earlier of 52.7 percent of GDP, the
government’s press office said in a statement today. The debt
level in 2012 will be 53 percent of GDP, exceeding the previous
51.9 percent forecast.  While  Poland  was the only member of the 27-nation European
Union to post economic growth in 2009 at the height of the
global crisis, the government has struggled to combat a widening
deficit and rising public debt.  Tax cuts introduced in 2009 helped boost consumption as
external demand waned helped push public debt to the highest
level in at least two decades at 52.8 percent of gross domestic
product, according to Polish accounting standards. Exceeding 55
percent of GDP would trigger mandatory austerity measures.  “We don’t see any risk that Poland will breach the 55
percent of GDP mark,” said Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski at
a press conference in Warsaw, adding the higher debt was a
result of the Polish currency’s weakness.  The zloty has slumped 9 percent against the euro so far
this quarter, the worst-performing of 10 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The government today reiterated its 2012 economic growth
forecast of 4 percent. The  International Monetary Fund  last week
cut its Polish 2012 growth estimate to 3 percent from an earlier
forecast of 3.8 percent, citing weaker global activity.  The 2012 budget must be approved by parliament and signed
by the president before it passes into law. As Poland faces a
general election on Oct. 9, the new government may also
introduce alterations to the draft budget before sending it to
parliament for debate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
