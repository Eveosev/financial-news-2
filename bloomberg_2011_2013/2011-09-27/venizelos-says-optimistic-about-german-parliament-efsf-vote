Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said he was very optimistic the German Parliament
would approve plans to overhaul the European Financial Stability
Facility.  Venizelos said initial data on a planned voluntary bond
swap, part of a second financing package for  Greece , was
“optimistic”. He declined to give any participation rate
estimates for the offer saying the data was “strictly
confidential” and that only he and the head of the Greek debt
office knew the figures.  Venizelos spoke to reporters in  Athens  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
