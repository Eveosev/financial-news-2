European Union Trade Commissioner
Karel  De Gucht  said  China ’s currency policy has a destabilizing
effect on world trade,  Germany ’s  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  “China keeps its currency artificially low and that’s
bad,” De Gucht told the newspaper in an interview published
today. “China destabilizes the global economy. At the same
time, we export two-thirds of the products we imported before.
Chinese imports at low prices are therefore also indirectly
helping our export industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
