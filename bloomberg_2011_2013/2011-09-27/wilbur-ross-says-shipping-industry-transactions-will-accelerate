Following are comments from  Wilbur
Ross , chairman of private-equity firm WL Ross & Co., made at a
Bloomberg Dealmakers Summit in  New York  today.  The 73-year-old is part of a group spending $900 million on
30 ships hauling gasoline, diesel and other refined products,
his first investment in the industry. That transaction closed at
midnight yesterday, he said.  “The deal is the same and I think you’re going to see more
transactions in shipping. Shipping is a very capital intensive
industry, a global industry, but highly fragmented.  “We’ll have altogether 38 tankers between crude tankers
and petroleum product tankers. That’s one of the larger fleets
that there is. And yet there are thousands of vessels on the
water. That’s one of the problems of the industry. It’s too
fragmented.  “So what made the opportunity for us, a few years back
charter rates went to the moon, round about 2007. Everybody
over-ordered vessels. Those are now coming through and there’s
over-supply there. People can’t meet their purchase commitments,
things like that. That’s obviously the reason we went into the
business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
