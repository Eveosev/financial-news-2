Savanna , a New York-based real
estate private-equity firm, bought 31 Penn Plaza, an 18-story
office building near midtown Manhattan’s Madison Square Garden
and  Penn Station .  The property, on West 31st Street between Sixth and Seventh
Avenues, has 444,000 square feet (41,200 square meters) of
space. Savanna plans to spend $26 million on improvements,
including a new front entrance and updates to the lobby and
elevators, the company said in a statement today.  “The neighborhood surrounding Penn Station and Madison
Square Garden is a growing mixed-use submarket with plans for
millions of square feet in office, retail, residential and hotel
development over the next few years,” Christopher Schlank, a
managing partner at Savanna, said in the statement. “The
improvements we have planned for the building should position 31
Penn Plaza as one of the upper-tier buildings in the
neighborhood.”  The deal is Savanna’s second in  Manhattan  in two weeks. On
Sept. 21, the company said it acquired 80 Broad St., a 36-story
Financial District office building with about 417,000 square
feet of space, after taking control of the senior mortgage
earlier this year.  Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. will handle leasing and management
of the Penn Plaza property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
