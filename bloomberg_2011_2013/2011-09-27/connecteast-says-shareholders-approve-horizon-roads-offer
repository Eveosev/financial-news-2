ConnectEast Group (CEU)  shareholders
today approved a bid by its biggest investor to buy the part of
the toll-road operator it doesn’t already own in a deal valuing
the company at A$2.17 billion ($2.14 billion).  More than 80 percent of ConnectEast investors voted in
favor of the cash offer by Horizon Roads, an investment vehicle
managed by infrastructure fund manager CP2 Ltd., ConnectEast
said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange. Melbourne-
based ConnectEast surged 13 percent to 55 Australian cents at
the 4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney, the highest since
November 2008.  The takeover hands  CP2 , which manages about A$2 billion in
funds, ownership of the EastLink toll road in  Melbourne  after
the  fund manager ’s offer for rival highway operator Transurban
Group was rejected in May 2010. Horizon’s 55 Australian cents a
share offer was 22 percent more than ConnectEast’s share price
on July 21, before the bid.  CP2 owns 35 percent of ConnectEast, the fund manager said
on July 22 in its proposal. ConnectEast shares will stop trading
on Oct. 5, the group said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
