European Central Bank council
member Jozef Makuch said policy makers will “certainly”
reintroduce 12-month loans for euro-region banks if necessary.  “If the 12-month facility is needed, the ECB will
certainly adopt it,” Makuch, who heads Slovakia’s central bank,
said at a press conference in Bratislava today. “It will depend
on the situation on the market.”  The ECB is under pressure to do more to combat  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis as money-market conditions tighten and
economic growth slows. In addition to considering renewed 12-
month loans, ECB policy makers will also debate restarting
covered-bond purchases when they meet in Berlin on Oct. 6, a
euro-area central bank official told Bloomberg News. Interest-
rate cuts may also be discussed, though they are not currently
on the meeting’s agenda, the official said.  “If needed, the ECB will use the instruments it is
entitled to use,” Makuch said today. “The ECB is now working
in a regime in which we are awaiting the definite political
decisions” on the euro area’s bailout fund, he said.  Makuch also said he “personally” doesn’t expect a
recession in the 17-nation euro region. “We are speaking about
downside risks to growth, not a recession,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
