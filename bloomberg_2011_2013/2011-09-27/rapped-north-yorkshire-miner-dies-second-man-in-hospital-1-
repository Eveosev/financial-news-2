A miner who was trapped underground
after a roof collapse at U.K. Coal Plc.’s Kellingley Colliery,
North Yorkshire today has died, North Yorkshire Police said in a
 statement  on their website. The man, in his 40s, was from North
Yorkshire, the statement said.  A second miner, in his 40s, was taken to hospital with
minor injuries, the police said. The two men were brought to the
surface at about 7:30 p.m. local time in a rescue operation
carried out by North Yorkshire Ambulance Service, North
Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, Mine Rescue Specialists and
the owner of the mine, U.K. Coal, the statement said.  An investigation into the incident will be carried out by
specialist mine inspectors from the U.K.’s Health and Safety
Executive and North Yorkshire Police, according to the
statement.  U.K. Coal Chief Executive Officer Gareth Williams said in a
statement broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corp. that the
miner “was confirmed dead by our own medical team, despite the
best efforts of our colleagues.”  The company will be seeking to establish what caused the
incident, Williams said, the  BBC  reported.  The company wasn’t immediately able to comment, spokesman
Gordon Grant said when contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
