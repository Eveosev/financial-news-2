Glencore International Plc may
return tankers to owners when long-term charter agreements
expire over the next six months, Reuters reported, citing Kent
Paulli, a director of the commodity trader’s freight unit.  Several crude  oil tankers  may be among the vessels
returned, Paulli, a director at ST Shipping & Transport Pte.,
told reporters at a conference today, Reuters reported. A
Glencore spokesman in Baar,  Switzerland  confirmed the comments
by phone when contacted by Bloomberg News.  Glencore’s oil-freight desk had 176 ships chartered for
long- and short-term durations for an average remaining period
of two years as of Dec. 31, according to the company’s
prospectus, published June 25. The desk had losses in 2008, 2009
and 2010 because of falling freight rates, according to the
prospectus, which didn’t provide further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
