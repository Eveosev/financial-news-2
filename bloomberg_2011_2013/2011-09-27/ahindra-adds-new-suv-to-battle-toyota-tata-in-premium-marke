Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , India’s
largest sport-utility vehicle maker, plans to introduce its
XUV500 model to compete with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Fortuner in
the growing premium SUV market.  The Mumbai-based automaker will price the XUV500 between
1.2 million rupees ($24,400) and 2 million rupees,  Pawan Goenka ,
president of Mahindra’s automobile and farm equipment division,
said Sept. 26.  The XUV500 is Mahindra’s bid to capture a slice of sales of
SUVs that sell for between 1.5 million rupees and 2 million
rupees. Mahindra may not be able to persuade buyers that the
XUV500 is truly a premium vehicle, said  Mahantesh Sabarad , an
analyst at Fortune Equity Broking India Ltd. in Mumbai.  “I don’t think it will be as big a game changer as
Mahindra expects,” said Sabarad, who has a “hold” rating on
the stock. “Brands in the premium bracket need to have some
sort of aspirational value which Mahindra and Tata do not have.
It won’t bring in great numbers.”  Mahindra gained 3.5 percent to 797.8 rupees at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai yesterday. The shares have gained 2.7
percent this year, compared with a 19 percent decline in the
benchmark BSE  India  Sensitive Index.  Premium SUV Market  The premium SUV market grew 15 percent to 2,102 vehicles in
the country last month, while April-August sales grew 20 percent
over the previous year compared with a 1.3 percent decline in
passenger car sales in that time, according to data from the
 Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers , or SIAM. The
association said in July it expects industrywide sales to rise
10 percent to 12 percent, to about as much as 2.8 million in the
year ending March 31.  “Our goal is to draw volume for XUV500 not just from the
premium SUV segment but from current buyers of sedans also,”
Goenka said in an interview. The company will introduce the
model today.  Mahindra, which is increasing profit from selling more
pick-up trucks and SUVs, may see full-year profit rise 6.5
percent to 32.8 billion rupees this fiscal year, according to
the median of nine analyst estimates.  Toyota’s Fortuner was the best-selling sport-utility
vehicle in the 1.5 million rupee to 2.5 million rupee  price
range  in April-August, selling more than double the second-place
model, Bayerische Motoren Werke’s X1, according to data from the
industry group.  Mahindra will introduce the XUV500 in  South Africa , and may
sell the vehicle in other export markets including  Brazil ,
Goenka said. The automaker may also sell the model under the
 Ssangyong Motor Co. (003620)  brand in the future, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
