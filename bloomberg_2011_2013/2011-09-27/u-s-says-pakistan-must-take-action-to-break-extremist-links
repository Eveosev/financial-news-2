The Obama administration called on
 Pakistan ’s government to act against an extremist network with
links to the country’s army and intelligence service.  The Haqqani network has been blamed by the U.S. for attacks
on American interests in Afghanistan, including the Sept. 14
assault on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul.  “The Pakistani government needs to take action to deal
with the link that exists there,” White House press secretary
 Jay Carney  told reporters traveling with President Barack Obama
to an event in Denver.  Asked if the U.S. is putting pressure on the Pakistanis to
take action, Carney said, “We are always reviewing our aid
programs. I do not have anything new to add on that.”  Admiral  Michael Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee Sept. 22 that
Haqqani network operatives planned and conducted the embassy
attack with support from Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence
agency.  The issue has further strained ties between the U.S. and
Pakistan. Pakistan’s Prime Minister  Yousuf Raza Gilani  has
denied any complicity with the network and said U.S. policy is
to blame for the deteriorating security situation in
Afghanistan. Pakistan’s country’s sacrifices in the war against
terrorism are “unquestionable,” Gilani said Sept. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
