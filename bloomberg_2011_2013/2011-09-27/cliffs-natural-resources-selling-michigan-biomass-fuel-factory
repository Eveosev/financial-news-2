Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., an
iron-ore producer, plans to sell a plant that makes biomass fuel
and isn’t running at full production.  The company is stopping production at its RenewaFuel
facility in Marquette,  Michigan , and is seeking a buyer,
Cleveland-based Cliffs said today in a statement. The mining
company will take a $30 million pretax charge in the third
quarter related to the action,  The plant makes biofuel cubes from wood and agricultural
feedstocks that are burned to produce electricity. It didn’t
perform to “design capacity, nor at a production level that
justifies continued operation,” the company said in the
statement.  “The business is likely to have better prospects with a
company more experienced in the area of biofuels that can
develop RenewaFuel to its full potential,” David Blake, a
senior vice president at Cliffs, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
