Thailand , the world’s largest rice
exporter, cut its estimate for output from the main harvest by
2.4 percent after floods damaged farmland, a state agency said.  Production from the nation’s main crop, which accounts for
about 70 percent of total output, may reach 24.5 million metric
tons, from an earlier estimate of 25.1 million tons, Apichart Jongskul, secretary-general of the Office of Agricultural
Economics, said in a phone interview today.  As many as 166 people have been killed in the past two
months as floodwaters spread across 57 of Thailand’s 77
provinces, according to the government. Heavy rain has damaged
an estimated 700,000 tons of unmilled rice, Apichart said. About
5.2 million rai (837,120 hectares) of rice land has been
inundated, the farm ministry said on its website.  Thailand’s main crop is planted in May and harvested in
October.  About 4.55 million tons of unmilled rice will be harvested
during August and September from 8.8 million rai of rice land,
according to estimates submitted to Cabinet today by Thailand’s
Commerce Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
