Cypriot authorities are monitoring
the movements of Turkish warships and a vessel exploring for
hydrocarbons off the island’s coast, Foreign Minister Erato Kozakou-Markoulli said.  “These military moves are watched by the  Ministry of
Foreign Affairs  and the  Ministry of Defense ,” she said,
according to a  statement  on the website of the  Press and
Information Office  in Nicosia.  Kozakou-Markoulli downplayed the role of the “antiquated”
Piri Reis, dispatched by  Turkey  to explore for hydrocarbons in
response to the start of drilling in Cyprus’s offshore
territory, saying the vessel doesn’t have the “right
equipment” to carry out “seismic exploration.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
