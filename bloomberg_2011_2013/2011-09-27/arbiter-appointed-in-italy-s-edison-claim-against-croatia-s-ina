An arbitration panel in Vienna was
appointed to hear  Edison SpA (EDN) ’s 140 million-euro ($190 million)
claim that Croatia’s INA Industrija Nafte d.d. failed to live up
to contract terms, INA said in a statement on its website.  INA, which is controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., jointly
owns 19 offshore platforms in the northern Adriatic with  Italy ’s
Edison and ENI SpA.  Edison alleges INA “did not fully comply with its
contractual obligation in the Izabela and Iris/Iva blocks on the
 Adriatic Sea ,” the company said.  Mol said in a separate statement that INA “fully contests
the allegation of Edison” and has submitted a counter-claim
against the Italian energy company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
