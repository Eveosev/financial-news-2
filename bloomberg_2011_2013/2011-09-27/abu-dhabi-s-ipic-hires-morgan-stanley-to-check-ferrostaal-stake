International Petroleum Investment
Co., which owns 70 percent of Ferrostaal AG, a German industrial
services company, hired  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to examine its stake in
the company, Abu Dhabi-based IPIC said today.  “IPIC continues to closely monitor Ferrostaal’s operations
and financial performance, consistent with its 70 percent
ownership,” the company said in an e-mailed statement today.
“We have asked Morgan Stanley to support our evaluation work,
which focuses on the financial and strategic status of
Ferrostaal, and avenues through which IPIC can assist the
company.”  Morgan Stanley has until a supervisory board meeting on
Oct. 13 to look at Ferrostaal’s liquidity and business model,
and to determine whether the company can pay likely bribery
fines by itself,  Germany ’s Handelsblatt reported yesterday. The
sale or closure of some businesses by Ferrostaal is under
consideration, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
