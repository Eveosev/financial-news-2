Klaus-Peter Willsch, a German
lawmaker from  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats
party, told the N-TV television program Das Duell that  Greece  is
unable to repay its debts.  German taxpayers cannot be expected to permanently
compensate for Greece’s deficit, Willsch said, according to an
e-mailed summary of the interview. The euro monetary union
should continue with fewer members, N-TV reported Willsch as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
