Kenyan coffee prices fell 15
percent at the last auction of 2010-11 today after global prices
slumped amid declining bean quality, the Nairobi Coffee Auction
said.  The average price for all the coffee sold fell to $280.04
per 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag, from $327.91 a week earlier,
the exchange said in an e-mailed statement today.  The benchmark AA grade rose 3.4 percent to an average of
$459.99 a bag from $444.77 last week after supplies declined 50
percent to 374 bags, the exchange said.  “The marked decline in prices was caused by a fall in
global prices,” David Muriithi, the exchange’s acting chief
executive, said by phone from Nairobi, the capital. Declining
quality and a weakening currency also affected prices, he said.  Sales at the auction fell 22 percent to 6,353 bags valued
at $2.2 million from 8,132 bags worth $3.3 million last week,
the exchange said. Supplies of the beans at the auction rose to
12,882 bags from 12,796 bags at the last sale.  Kenya ’s coffee production in the 12 months through
September may decline 27 percent 40,000 metric tons from a
previous forecast of 49,000 to 55,000 tons, James Wahome, the
quality manager at the Coffee Board of Kenya, said on Jan. 17.
The country produced 45,000 tons last season.  The country harvests the bulk of its crop from October
through December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to
June.  The following are details of today’s auction in U.S.
