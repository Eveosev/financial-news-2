European Union lawmakers approved a
plan to give the  Palestinian Authority  greater access to the EU
food market in a bid to bolster the local economy and drive for
statehood.  The  European Parliament  voted to grant direct duty-free and
quota-free access to the EU market for farm and fisheries goods
from the  West Bank  and  Gaza Strip . Palestinian products have
been under the direct control of Israel’s customs authorities,
according to the 27-nation EU assembly.  “This agreement offers an opportunity for the Palestinian
people -- a first step toward the development of a nation,”
said  Maria Eleni Koppa , a Greek member who steered the measure
through the EU assembly today in Strasbourg,  France . The deal,
to take effect next year, also provides access to Palestinian
markets for some European produce.  Trade between the EU and the Palestinian Authority totaled
56.6 million euros ($77.1 million) in 2009, according to the
Parliament. Of that, EU imports from the Palestinian Authority
were valued at 6.1 million euros, of which agricultural goods
made up 70 percent, said the assembly.  The  United Nations Security Council  is due to meet this
week to have the admissions committee take up a membership
request by the Palestinian Authority, a process that can last
days, weeks or months. The U.S. is seeking to delay a showdown
while diplomats try to resurrect peace talks that broke down a
year ago over construction of Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
