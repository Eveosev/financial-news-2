Brazil ’s Center South, the world’s
largest sugar-producing region, will export 21.8 million metric
tons of the sweetener this year, 12 percent less than a year
ago, Copersucar SA said.  Sugar shipments from the region will fall from 24.8 million
tons in 2010, according to a spokesman for Copersucar, who can’t
be named because of the company’s policy.  Copersucar is a Sao Paulo-based sugar-trading cooperative
that accounts for 10 percent of global sugar exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
