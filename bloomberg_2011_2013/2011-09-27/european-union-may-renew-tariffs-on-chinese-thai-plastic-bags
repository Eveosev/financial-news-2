The European Union threatened to
renew tariffs on plastic bags from China and  Thailand  for
another five years to curb import competition.  The EU said it would review whether to let lapse the duties
of as high as 28.8 percent on shopping and garbage bags. The
bloc imposed the levies in 2006 to punish Chinese and Thai
exporters for selling the sacks in  Europe  below cost, a practice
known as  dumping . The goal was to protect EU producers such as
France’s Groupe Barbier SA and  Spain ’s Plasbel SA.  The review will determine whether the expiry of the levies
“would be likely, or unlikely, to lead to a continuation of
dumping and a continuation of injury,” the European Commission,
the 27-nation EU’s trade authority in Brussels, said today in
the  Official Journal . The duties were due to expire this week
and will now stay in place during the probe, which can last as
long as 15 months.  The inquiry results from a June 30 request by European
manufacturers that account for more than a quarter of EU
production of the plastic bags covered by the levies, according
to the commission. When imposing the anti-dumping duties five
years ago, the EU said Chinese and Thai exporters increased
their combined share of the EU plastic-bag market to 18 percent
in the 12 months through March 2005 from 14 percent in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
