Egypt ’s first parliamentary
elections since the ouster of former President  Hosni Mubarak 
will start on Nov. 28, state-run television reported today,
citing the ruling military council.  Elections for the lower house of parliament will start on
that date, with voting for the upper house beginning on Jan. 29,
the broadcaster said.  Egypt’s Cabinet said Sept. 25 that it approved amendments
to the draft elections law that will allow two-thirds of both
houses of parliament to be contested through party lists, and
the rest by individual candidates. The lower house was reduced
to 498 seats from 504, and the upper to 270 from 390.  To contact the reporter on this story:
