Close Brothers Group Plc (CBG) , the
British investment bank founded in 1878, said profit for the
year declined 78 percent as it sold its U.K. offshore and Cayman
Islands units.  Full-year net income fell to 14.6 million pounds ($22.8
million) from 65.9 million pounds in the year-earlier period,
the London-based lender said in a statement today. It posted an
exceptional charge of 46.9 million pounds and a loss from
discontinued operations of 28.1 million pounds.  Close Brothers is restructuring its asset management
business and sold the U.K. offshore and Cayman Islands
operations to focus on its banking, securities and asset
management divisions. Adjusted operating profit at the banking
unit climbed 34 percent in the period.  “Economic and market conditions are uncertain, but we have
a strong financial position, continue to see good prospects for
our businesses, and are well placed to continue delivering solid
results,” the bank said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
