Treasuries fell, pushing 30-year
bond yields up the most over three days since January 2009, on
speculation  Europe ’s leaders are moving toward agreement on
measures to counter the region’s debt crisis.  Yields on 10-year notes extended their advance from a
record low as Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  won a vote
on a new property tax, bolstering his chances of pushing through
austerity cuts aimed at securing more international aid. The
U.S. Treasury Department’s $35 billion auction of two-year notes
produced the highest demand in a year as some investors still
sought safety. U.S. stocks strengthened.  “Treasuries are recovering from very-overbought levels and
giving up gains as equities and other risk markets are
rebounding some,” said Paul Horrmann, a  broker in New York at
Tradition Asiel Securities Inc., an interdealer broker.  Thirty-year bond yields increased eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 3.07 percent at 5:04 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.75 percent
maturities due in August 2041 slid 1 5/8, or $16.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 113 1/4.  Yields on the long bonds advanced as much as 32 basis
points over three days, the most in almost three years. The
yields tumbled 40 basis points over the two days ended Sept. 22,
the biggest decrease since November 2008.  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures
price swings in Treasuries based on prices of over-the-counter
options maturing in two to 30 years, rose yesterday to 107.4,
the highest since Aug. 25. This year’s average is 91.21.  Two-Year Notes  Current two-year note yields rose one basis point to 0.24
percent. A drop in 10-year notes pushed yields up seven basis
points to 1.97 percent after they fell on Sept. 23 as low as
1.6714 percent, the lowest in Fed data beginning in 1953.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.1 percent after
earlier rallying as much as 2.8 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600
Index climbed 4.4 percent. The euro rose 0.5 percent to $1.3598.  Yields on 30-year bonds fell last week the most in almost
three years and two-year note yields increased after the Fed
announced on Sept. 21 it would buy $400 billion of bonds with
maturities of six to 30 years through June while selling an
equal amount of debt maturing in three years or less to support
growth under what is known as Operation Twist.  Auction Yield  At today’s two-year note auction, the securities drew a
yield of 0.249 percent, compared with the average forecast of
0.251 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of nine primary dealers
and a record low auction yield of 0.222 percent on Aug. 23.  The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing
total bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.76, the
highest since the September 2010 offering.  “It went pretty well,” said  Thomas Roth , a senior trader
in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “There was
fear that with all the paper coming from Operation Twist, the
two-year was going to back up. It backed up to levels that made
sense for people.”  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 36.7 percent of the notes, compared
with 31.6 percent in August and an average of 30.3 percent for
the past 10 offerings.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 12.2 percent of
the notes, compared with 15.9 percent last month and the 10-sale
average of 15.1 percent.  Net Pay-Down  More than $61 billion of maturing two-year securities are
held by the public and the Fed, including $57.8 billion by the
public and $3.4 billion by the central bank, according to
Treasury Department data. Today’s auction is a net pay-down of
$26.2 billion.  U.S. government debt securities dropped earlier today as
 Germany ’s Chancellor  Angela Merkel  urged lawmakers to support an
enhancement of the euro rescue fund two days before a vote on
the proposal.  Germany will provide all the help it can to stabilize
 Greece , Merkel said at an industry federation event in Berlin.
The priority is that markets regain confidence, she said.  A total of 155 Greek lawmakers in the 300-member Parliament
supported the property tax and 142 voted against, Speaker
Filippos Petsalnikos said in remarks carried live on state-run
Vouli TV today. A total of 297 deputies voted. Today’s vote also
approved a bill to expand the European Financial Stability
Facility, Petsalnikos said.  Group of 20  Euro-region finance chiefs from the Group of 20 nations,
meeting in  Washington  on Sept. 22, committed to boosting the
flexibility of their rescue fund and to “maximize its impact”
by the time of the next G-20 meeting Oct. 3.  “Europeans finally get it,”  Mohamed A. El-Erian , chief
executive officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., the
world’s biggest manager of bond funds, said today in a radio
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. “They recognize they have deep problems, and they
recognize they need to do something about it. And now they are
going back and will try to do something about it. This was a
very important wake-up call for Europe.”  Treasuries rallied in recent weeks on demand for a refuge
from Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis and a stalled American
economy. U.S. debt securities have returned 6.3 percent this
quarter, the most since the depths of the financial crisis in
the fourth quarter of 2008, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. They have gained 1.6 percent in September.  The government’s two-year offering is the first of three
note auctions this week totaling $99 billion. The Treasury will
sell $35 billion in five-year debt tomorrow and $29 billion of
seven-year securities on the following day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
