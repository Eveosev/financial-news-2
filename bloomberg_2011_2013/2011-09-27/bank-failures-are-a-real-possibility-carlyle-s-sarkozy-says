Bank failures are “a real
possibility” as  Europe  grapples with a debt crisis, said
Olivier Sarkozy, head of a team that handles investments in
financial-services companies at  Carlyle Group .  “The liquidity crisis there is real,” Sarkozy said today
in an interview on Bloomberg television at a Bloomberg Link
conference in New York. “The government response is more
complex and complicated. As a result, there is a chance there
will be major implications for major financial players in
Europe.”  Banks are shedding assets as a way to raise capital, an
opportunity that Sarkozy said he would like to capitalize on.  “The thing that interests us is there seems to be more
supply than there will be capital to meet that supply,” said
Sarkozy, based in New York and half-brother of French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy . “We feel as if we will be in a position to buy
smartly, and, hopefully, with a little focus, we will turn them
around and make them worth more over time.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
