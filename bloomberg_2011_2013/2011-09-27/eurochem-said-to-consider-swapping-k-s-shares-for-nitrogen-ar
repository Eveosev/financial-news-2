OAO EuroChem, the Russian
fertilizer maker owned by billionaire Andrey Melnichenko, may
seek to swap part of its holding in K+S AG for the German potash
maker’s nitrogen-fertilizer distribution arm, a person familiar
with the plan said.  EuroChem is considering the purchase of the marketing
business as a complement to its $947 million purchase of  BASF
SE (BAS) ’s fertilizer-making units, said the person, who declined to
be identified as the plan is private. K+S has an exclusive
agreement to sell output from the assets EuroChem acquired.  Melnichenko is the largest investor in K+S with a 9.88
percent stake.  K+S,  Europe ’s biggest potash producer, is getting advice
from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  over the possible sale of the
unit, two other people familiar with the matter said. Spokesman
Michael Wudonig said all options are being considered.  Vladimir Torin, spokesman for EuroChem in Moscow, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
