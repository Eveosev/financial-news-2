Treasuries snapped their steepest
two-day loss in a month before an industry report that may show
U.S.  home prices  declined in July.  Two-year yields were the highest in a month as the U.S.
prepared to sell $35 billion of the securities today, the first
of three note auctions this week totaling $99 billion. The
S&P/Case-Shiller index of property values in 20 cities fell 4.4
percent from July 2010, the 10th year-on-year drop, according to
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The market needs time to confirm an improvement in
economic conditions before yields can rise,” said Kei Katayama
at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo. “The economic figures
are mixed.” Katayama helps manage the equivalent of $64.9
billion, including  Asia ’s second-biggest bond fund as leader of
the foreign fixed-income group.  U.S. 10-year rates fell one basis point to 1.90 percent as
of 11:09 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The 2.125 percent security due in August 2021 rose 1/32,
or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 102 2/32. The yield
climbed 18 basis points over the last two sessions, the biggest
back-to-back increase since Aug. 24.  Today’s report on home prices follows Commerce Department
data yesterday that showed purchases of new houses in the U.S.
declined in August to a six-month low.  Two-Year Auction  The two-year notes being sold today yielded 0.23 percent in
pre-auction trading, rising from 0.222 percent at the prior sale
on Aug. 23, which was a record low.  Investors bid for 3.44 times the amount for sale in August,
the most since May at the monthly auctions.  Indirect bidders, the category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 31.6 percent of the notes, the
highest level since April.  Treasuries fell yesterday, pushing 10-year yields up from
almost record lows, as stocks gained after finance chiefs
including Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  urged Europeans
to step up efforts to contain the debt crisis.  Yields on 30-year bonds also rose yesterday, after tumbling
last week the most in almost three years as the  Federal Reserve 
said it would buy longer-term debt to keep borrowing costs low.  “Investors are taking more risk,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $1.7 billion as chief investment officer
at United Nations Federal Credit Union in  New York . “We’ve
rallied so strong that we will be hard pressed to move much
lower in rates unless another shoe drops in  Europe .”  U.S. 10-year yields fell to a record 1.6714 percent on Sept.
23.  Japan ’s two-year notes were little changed with a yield of
0.125 percent. The government is scheduled to sell 2.6 trillion
yen ($34.1 billion) of the securities today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
