The  National Basketball Association 
and its players’ union will resume talks today after two hours
of meetings yesterday aimed at ending a three-month lockout.  “We spent some quality time discussing concepts,” NBA
Commissioner  David Stern  told reporters outside the hotel in
 Manhattan  where the sides met. “Sometimes when you discuss
concepts you want to go back and think about it.”  Owners of the league’s 30 teams and the union are
negotiating how to split money from a league that had $4.3
billion in revenue last season. Stern says the teams
collectively lost about $300 million. The NBA locked out its
players when their labor contract expired July 1.  National Basketball Players Association  President  Derek Fisher  refused to say whether any progress was made.  “We talked extensively in ideas and concepts,” Fisher
said outside the hotel. “These are things that, if we can get
into the range of, get into the zone of, then we can maybe put a
deal together.”  The NBA on Sept. 23 postponed the start of training camps
indefinitely and 43 preseason games through Oct. 15, increasing
the likelihood that the regular season won’t start as scheduled
on Nov. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
