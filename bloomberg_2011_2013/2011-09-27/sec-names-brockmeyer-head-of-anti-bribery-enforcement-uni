The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission named Kara Brockmeyer, an 11-year veteran of the
agency, to lead a unit responsible for enforcing anti-bribery
laws.  Brockmeyer, 44, spearheaded probes of  Halliburton Co. (HAL) ,  KBR
Inc. (KBR)  and  Technip SA (TEC)  as part of a decades-long bribery scheme in
Nigeria that resulted in a $1.2 billion settlement of civil and
criminal claims, the SEC said today in a statement.  Her unit, which looks for violations of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, was set up in 2010 as part of an overhaul of the
enforcement division. She will replace Cheryl Scarboro, who left
the SEC in June to join law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.  Brockmeyer, who joined the agency in 2000, has served as
co-head of a group focused on U.S. companies that have a
substantial amount of their operations overseas. The group has
sanctioned several firms this year for failing to report
problems related to their accounting, including the resignation
of independent auditors.  “Kara’s creativity and perseverance is reflected in her
outstanding efforts and results over the years in fulfilling the
commission’s mission of investor protection,” Enforcement
Director Robert Khuzami said in the agency’s statement.  Brockmeyer has also supervised investigations involving
financial fraud,  insider trading  and market manipulation, the
SEC said. She graduated from  Williams College  in 1989 and the
University of Michigan Law School in 1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
