Australia ’s dollar advanced against
its U.S. counterpart by the most in nearly three weeks as stocks
rallied around the world, supporting demand for higher-yielding
assets.  New Zealand ’s currency, known as the kiwi, rallied for a
second day versus the dollar and yen as prices for commodities
advanced, boosting prospects for the nation’s resource exports.
Demand for the South Pacific currencies was limited amid
investor concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  “I wouldn’t be surprised to see few more rallies in the
Aussie over the next couple of days and equity markets picking
up another 2 to 3 percent,” said  Thomas Averill , a director at
foreign-exchange and interest-rate risk management company
Rochford Capital in Sydney. “I think Aussie dollar and kiwi
dollar will be well-supported.”  The Australian dollar rose 1.3 percent to 99.63 U.S. cents
as of 11:57 a.m. in  New York  from 98.33 cents in New York
yesterday. It earlier rose as much as 1.5 percent, its biggest
intraday gain since Sept. 7. The Aussie bought 76.31 yen from
75.08 yen. New Zealand’s currency gained 1.6 percent to 79.29
U.S. cents from 78.02 cents. It bought 60.73 yen from 59.57 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares rallied 3.8 percent
and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 2.3 percent.  The South Pacific currencies earlier weakened against their
U.S. and Japanese counterparts on concern European policy makers
will struggle to resolve a debt crisis.  “The market is still lacking in confidence that European
policy makers have what it takes to restore confidence,” said
Greg Gibbs, a currency strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in Sydney. “If you get rallies from here, its upside
is going to be more contained.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
