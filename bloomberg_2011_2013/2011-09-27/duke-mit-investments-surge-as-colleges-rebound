Endowment managers at  Duke
University  and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said
returns surged as more colleges’ investments rebounded from the
global financial crisis that began in 2008.  Duke’s investments increased 24.5 percent in the fiscal
year ended June 30, bringing the value of its endowment to $5.7
billion, the Durham, North Carolina, college said today in an e-
mailed statement. MIT’s investments gained 18 percent, raising
its fund to $9.9 billion at the end of the fiscal year, the
Cambridge, Massachusetts, school said in a separate statement.  Duke’s performance for the year beat  Harvard University ,
whose endowment investments returned 21 percent for the year,
and Stanford University, where annual returns were 22 percent.
All four universities have reported two years of endowment gains
following losses of as much as 30 percent in the financial
crisis that began with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
bankruptcy.  Duke’s endowment is made up of more than 4,000 individual
funds, the college said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
