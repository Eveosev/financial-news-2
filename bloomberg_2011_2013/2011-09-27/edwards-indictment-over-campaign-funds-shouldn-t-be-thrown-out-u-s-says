Former U.S. Senator  John Edwards ’s
indictment for accepting illegal campaign contributions to hide
an extramarital affair shouldn’t be dismissed, federal
prosecutors said.  The indictment isn’t “unconstitutionally vague,”
prosecutors said today in their response to Edwards’ request to
dismiss the charges on legal grounds. The government response to
Edwards’ claim that the case should be dismissed because of
“grand jury irregularities” was filed separately under seal.  “The statute and regulation are written in plain English
and are not difficult to understand,” government lawyers said
in their filing in federal court in North Carolina.
“Longstanding Federal Election Committee opinions confirm their
straightforward meaning.”  Edwards, who was Democrat  John Kerry ’s running mate in the
2004 presidential election, was the subject of a two-year
investigation into whether he used more than $925,000 in
contributions to conceal his relationship with filmmaker Rielle Hunter.  The former  North Carolina  senator sought to dismiss the
charges, saying prosecutors abused their authority and that the
grand jury proceedings were flawed and the indictment failed to
state an actual crime.  Jim Cooney, a lawyer for Edwards, didn’t immediately return
a call to his office after regular business hours.  The case is U.S. v. Edwards, 11-00161, U.S. District Court,
Middle District of North Carolina (Greensboro).  To contact the reporter on this story:
