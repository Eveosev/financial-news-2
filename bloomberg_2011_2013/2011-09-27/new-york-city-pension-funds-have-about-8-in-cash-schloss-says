New York City ’s pension funds have
raised cash holdings to about 8 percent on average after selling
some high-yield bonds and stocks in the past three to six
months, said the city’s chief investment officer.  “Usually we have zero” in cash, Larry Schloss, who
oversees about $120 billion of retirement assets, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television. “There’s so much uncertainty
now. Typically a pension fund would have their liquid assets in
the stock market.”  On a longer horizon, “equity markets are a great place to
be,” he said.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has declined about 5.9
percent this year. U.S. high-yield bonds have returned -0.48
percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
