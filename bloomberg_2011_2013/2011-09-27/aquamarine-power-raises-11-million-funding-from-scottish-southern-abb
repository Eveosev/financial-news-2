Aquamarine Power Ltd., a U.K.
developer of wave energy machines, raised 7 million pounds ($11
million) from investors including power grid supplier  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) 
and the venture capital unit of  Scottish & Southern Energy Plc. (SSE)   SSE Venture Capital and ABB invested 3 million pounds each,
Edinburgh-based Aquamarine said today in an e-mailed statement.
Scottish Enterprise, a state agency, invested another 1 million
pounds. Aquamarine this month got a loan from Barclays Plc, the
first bank to offer funds for a U.K. marine energy project.  “This level of commitment frees us up to concentrate fully
on the challenge of deploying Oyster technology to produce cost
effective, reliable, clean energy from the sea,” Chief
Executive Officer Martin McAdam said in the statement.  The company is working with major shareholders to raise a
further 18 million pounds to help bring its Oyster wave energy
machine to market in 2014, Aquamarine said. “We are still
seeking new shareholders who can bring additional finance and
technical expertise to our business by investing alongside our
existing shareholders in future rounds,” McAdam said.  Scotland  is seeking to supply all of its power needs from
renewable sources by 2020 and has the potential to provide as
much as a quarter of  Europe ’s tidal power and a 10th of its wave
power, according to the Scottish government.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
