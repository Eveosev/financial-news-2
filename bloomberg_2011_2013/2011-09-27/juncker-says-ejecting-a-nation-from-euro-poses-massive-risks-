Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker
said ejecting a nation from the euro area would involve
“massive risks” for  Europe .  “I am absolutely and vehemently opposed to the idea that
one or two member countries would be obliged to leave the euro
zone,” Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance
ministers, told the European Parliament today in Strasbourg,
France. “That would resolve no problem and would increase the
problems for the countries concerned and for the monetary zone
as a whole.”  Aid packages for Greece, Ireland and Portugal as well as
bond purchases by the  European Central Bank  over the past year
and a half have failed to stamp out debt concerns that the Greek
government triggered. Greece is seeking to meet budget-austerity
conditions for a sixth tranche of aid from an initial 110
billion-euro ($150 billion) international rescue in May 2010.   To contact the reporter on this story:
