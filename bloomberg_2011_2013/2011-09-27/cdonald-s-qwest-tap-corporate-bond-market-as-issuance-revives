McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  and Qwest Corp.
are leading at least $8.22 billion in company bond sales in the
U.S. on the busiest day for issuance in almost two weeks as
optimism grew that  Europe ’s debt crisis will be contained.  McDonald’s, the world’s largest restaurant chain, sold $500
million of 2.625 percent notes due in January 2022 that yield 78
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Denver-based Qwest, a unit of
 CenturyLink Inc. (CTL) , issued $950 million of debt maturing in
December 2021 that pay a spread of 500 basis points, or 5
percentage points, Bloomberg data show.  Corporate bond offerings rebounded after falling last week
to $1.7 billion, the lowest level this year, with U.S. Treasury
Secretary  Timothy Geithner  predicting that European governments
will use more force to resolve the region’s crisis. Companies
from 3M Co. to AES Corp. issued $3.2 billion of debt yesterday,
Bloomberg data show.  “Issuers were waiting for a day or two of stability,”
Timothy Cox, executive director of debt capital markets at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “We’re going to be looking back at these yields and
every treasurer’s going to wish they issued at these levels.”  Sanofi, France’s biggest drugmaker, sold $1 billion of
three-year, 1.2 percent notes that pay a spread of 83 basis
points, Bloomberg data show. AMR Corp., owner of  American
Airlines , plans to raise $726 million of debt backed by Boeing
jets.  Companies have issued $62.4 billion of bonds this month
through yesterday, including $12.2 billion on Sept. 14,
Bloomberg data show.  Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds averaged 3.92
percent yesterday, compared with an all-time low 3.45 percent on
Aug. 4, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
