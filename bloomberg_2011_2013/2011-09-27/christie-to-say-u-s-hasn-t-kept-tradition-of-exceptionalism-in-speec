New Jersey  Governor  Chris Christie 
will say the U.S. has “failed to live up to our own tradition
of exceptionalism,” according to excerpts of a speech to be
delivered tonight.  Christie, 49, will speak at the  Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library  in Simi Valley,  California , as part of a national round
of speeches and fundraising for his party’s candidates in New
Jersey and other states.  The first-term Republican has denied interest in a 2012
White House run even as party leaders have intensified calls for
him to join the race, according to a Republican close to the
governor who declined to be identified because he isn’t
authorized to speak for him.  “Through our own domestic political conduct of late, we
have failed to live up to our own tradition of exceptionalism,”
Christie plans to say, according to excerpts released by his
office. “Our role and ability to affect change has been
diminished because of our own problems and our inability to
effectively deal with them.”  The speech gives Christie, who has urged Republican
presidential candidates to take a harder line on entitlement
spending and debt, an opportunity to expand his influence in
national politics and shape the race.  Christie defeated incumbent Democrat  Jon Corzine  in 2009
amid voter dissatisfaction over the state economy and the
highest property taxes in the nation. He rose to prominence in
national Republican circles after cutting $10 billion in
spending in his first budget and requiring public workers to pay
more for pensions and health insurance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
