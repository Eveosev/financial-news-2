Malaysia  stocks would see outflows
of as much as 14 billion ringgit if foreign ownership levels
fall to the previous low, Credit Suisse Group AG said.  Foreign ownership in Malaysia dropped to 21.6 percent in
August from 22.1 percent in July, Tan Ting Min, an analyst at
Credit Suisse, wrote in report dated today. Foreign shareholding
touched a low of 20.3 percent in November 2009.  “Stocks with high foreign shareholding could be vulnerable
to a further sell-down in the current pessimistic environment:
Air Asia Co. (a foreign shareholding of 52 percent), Genting Bhd
(with 42 percent), IJM Corp. (41 percent),  CIMB Group Holdings
Bhd (CIMB)  (36 percent),  Genting Malaysia Bhd (GENM)  (36 percent) and  Gamuda
Bhd (GAM)  (30 percent),” the analyst wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
