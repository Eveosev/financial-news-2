Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  will meet today with business representatives and
government officials to decide on measures to guard the South
American economy from a possible global recession.  “No country is immune to what is happening on an
international level,” Santos was quoted as saying in a
 statement  posted late yesterday on the presidential website.  Colombia is “stronger” than it was in 2008 given its
increased international reserves, higher quality of financial
assets, lower budget deficit and inflation, and its  credit line 
with the International Monetary Fund, Santos said according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
