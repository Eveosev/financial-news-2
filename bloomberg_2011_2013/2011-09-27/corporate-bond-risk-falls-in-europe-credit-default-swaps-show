The cost of insuring against
default on European financial debt fell for a third day amid
speculation policy makers will step up efforts to contain the
region’s deficit crisis.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of credit-default swaps
on senior debt of 25 banks and insurers declined 16.5 basis
points to 259.5 and the subordinated gauge was 26 lower at 498,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 3 p.m. in London. A decline
signals improved perceptions of  credit quality .  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  predicted
governments will boost their response to the 1 1/2-year-old
crisis after a chiding from counterparts around the world.

George Papandreou for talks in Berlin today as the leaders face
mounting pressure to agree on a rescue deal.  “How many ‘hope’ rallies have ended up in eventual
disappointment in Europe over the last 18 months?”  Jim Reid ,
head of fundamental strategy at Deutsche Bank AG in London,
wrote in a note to investors. “The answer is they all have in
the end. Is this time any different?”  Credit-default swaps on BNP Paribas SA dropped 40 basis
points to 232 and are down from a record 309 on Sept. 22,
according to CMA. Contracts on Deutsche Bank AG declined 25 to
171, Credit Suisse Group AG tumbled 22 to 170 and Credit
Agricole SA fell 35 to 232, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped
39.5 basis points to 793. The Markit iTraxx  Europe  Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings was down nine at 187.5
basis points. Both benchmarks are down from the highest levels
in 2 1/2 years.  Sovereign Swaps  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments dropped 17.5 basis points to 334.5, after reaching a
record 358 on Sept. 23. A basis point on a credit-default swap
protecting $10 million of debt from default for five years is
equivalent to $1,000 a year.  Contracts on Belgium declined 24 basis points to 258,
 France  dropped 24 to 173 and  Germany  fell seven to 103,
according to CMA. Ireland decreased 49 basis points to 751 and
 Italy  fell 50 to 453, while Portugal was 61 lower at 1,121 and
 Spain  was down 32 at 368.  It now costs $6.2 million in advance and $100,000 annually
to insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years. Swaps pay
the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities
or the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its
debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
