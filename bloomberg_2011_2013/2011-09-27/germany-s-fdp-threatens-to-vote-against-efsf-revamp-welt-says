German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s
junior coalition partner, the Free Democratic Party, is
threatening to vote against an overhaul of the European
Financial Stability Facility if discussions about leveraging the
fund don’t stop,  Die Welt  newspaper reported.  The FDP opposes any form of leverage for the region’s
rescue fund because it would increase the burden on German
taxpayers and circumvent parliament, Hermann Otto Solms, the
party’s deputy floor leader and finance spokesman, was quoted as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
