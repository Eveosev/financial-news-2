Sundance Resources Ltd., subject of
a A$1.2 billion ($1.18 billion) bid from Sichuan Hanlong Group,
rose the most in more than three months in Sydney after the
Australian Financial Review reported the deal may succeed.  The Perth-based developer of a $4.7 billion iron ore mine
in  Africa  rose 15 percent to 41.5 cents at the 4:10 p.m. close
of Sydney trading, the most since July 18. The stock was the
third-strongest performer on the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  China ’s Hanlong, which holds a 17.8 percent stake in its
target, may win a recommendation from Sundance in the next 10
business days after raising its 50 cents-a-share bid, the AFR
reported in its Street Talk column, without saying where it got
the information. Buying Sundance will give Hanlong control of
the Mbalam iron ore mine, port and railroad project that
straddles the border of Cameroon and Republic of Congo.  Jill Thomas, investor relations manager at Sundance, wasn’t
immediately available for comment when contacted by phone.  Bannerman Resources Ltd. (BMN) , the target of a A$143 million
takeover from Hanlong, rose 36 percent to 32 cents at the close
of Sydney trading, the most since the stock listed on April 28,
2005. The shares rose after the Perth-based uranium developer
said talks were progressing well.  Hanlong’s study of the company’s books is “ongoing but
well progressed,” Bannerman said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
