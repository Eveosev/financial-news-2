Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , the mortgage company
majority owned by  Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB) , plans to raise at
least $300 milllion to $500 million from the sale of Islamic
bonds next quarter, its first debt sale since 2008.  “There is demand for Islamic paper,” acting Chief
Executive Officer Varun Sood said in Dubai today. “We’re
waiting for a window of opportunity to issue. Hopefully this
will come before the end of the year.” The sale will either be
denominated in dollars or Malaysian ringgit, he said.  The Dubai-based company hired three banks to manage the
issue, including Dubai Islamic, Sood said. Tamweel last issued
bonds in July 2008 when it sold 1.1 billion dirhams ($299
million) of sukuk, paying a profit rate of 2.25 percentage
points more than the quarterly Emirates interbank offered rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also raised $300
million from a sukuk sale in December 2007.  Global sales of Islamic bonds, which pay asset returns to
comply with Shariah’s ban on interest, climbed to $17.4 billion
in 2011, compared with $10.7 billion in the year-earlier period,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The yield on Tamweel’s 4.31 percent sukuk maturing January
2013 was little changed today at 8.37 percent, according to EFG-
Hermes UAE Ltd. prices on Bloomberg.  Mortgage volumes today are between 15 to 20 percent of home
financing levels in 2008, Sood said. Tamweel, which along with
fellow Islamic lender Amlak PJSC provided almost 90 percent of
all mortgages in the  United Arab Emirates , halted lending in
October 2008 after the global credit crisis blocked their access
to funds.  The company resumed lending last November after Dubai
Islamic Bank, the U.A.E.’s biggest bank that complies with
Muslim banking rules, raised its stake to 58 percent to help
boost the mortgage market.  To contact the reporters on this story:
