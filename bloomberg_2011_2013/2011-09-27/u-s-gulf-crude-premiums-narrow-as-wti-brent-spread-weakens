U.S. Gulf crude premiums weakened
after the discount for West Texas Intermediate versus Brent
narrowed.  The gap between WTI and Brent November contracts decreased
$1.12 to $22.58 a barrel in  New York . The spread settled Sept. 6
at a record margin of $26.87.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost $1 to $27 a barrel
above above WTI at 12:20 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium lost $1
to $26 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend declined by 70 cents to $23 a barrel while Poseidon
weakened 35 cents to $23 a barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed $1.75 to $21 a
barrel and West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at 90 cents
a barrel below WTI. Thunder Horse’s premium slipped $1.50 to
$25.50 above the benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $8.75 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$10.60 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
