Lynas Corp., an Australian rare
earth developer that slumped 45 percent in the last six trading
days, rose the most in more than two years in Sydney on optimism
for sustained demand for the elements used in iPods and magnets.  The shares gained 35 percent to A$1.18 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of Sydney trading, the most since May 1, 2009. The Sydney-
based company is the biggest gainer today on the MSCI AC Asia
Pacific Index.  Lynas fell the most in more than two years last week after
JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its rating on Molycorp Inc., the
owner of the worldâ€™s largest rare-earth deposit outside  China ,
citing declines in rare-earth prices. The drop in shares of U.S.
producers was unwarranted, according to Morgan Stanley, which
predicts prices will stabilize in the fourth quarter.  The fundamental outlook for rare earths remains strong
given expected demand growth for their use in applications,
including hybrid cars and wind turbines, Geoff Muers, resources
analyst with Investec Bank Australia Ltd. said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
