The following is the text of
the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank’s manufacturing sector
activity survey for September.  Manufacturing activity in the central Atlantic region contracted
at a less pronounced rate this month, according to the Richmond
Fed’s latest survey. Looking at the main components of activity,
employment grew at a slightly quicker rate, while shipments
exhibited more moderate weakness and new orders slipped further
into negative territory. Evidence of diminished weakness was
also reflected in most other indicators. District contacts
reported that backlogs, capacity utilization, and delivery times
remained negative but improved from August’s readings.
Manufacturers reported somewhat quicker growth in finished goods
inventories.  Looking forward, manufacturers’ assessments of business
prospects for the next six months were more optimistic in
September. Contacts at more firms anticipated that shipments,
new orders, backlogs, and capacity utilization would grow more
quickly during the next six months than they expected in August,
while growth in  capital expenditures  would be slower.  Survey assessments of current prices revealed that raw materials
grew at a somewhat slower rate in September than a month ago,
while finished goods prices grew at a slightly faster pace. Over
the next six months, respondents expected growth in raw
materials prices to rise roughly on pace with August’s
expectations. They also anticipated price growth in finished
goods to increase more slowly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
