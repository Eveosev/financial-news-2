Russian central bank Chairman
Sergey Ignatiev said he expects the ruble to strengthen against
the dollar and euro in the coming weeks.  There’s a “significantly higher” chance the ruble will
strengthen than weaken with Urals crude,  Russia ’s main export
blend of oil, at about $100 a barrel, Ignatiev told reporters in
Moscow today. He said he was “entirely satisfied” with the
paramaters of the current corridor the central bank uses to
smooth fluctuations in the ruble rate that hurt exporters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
