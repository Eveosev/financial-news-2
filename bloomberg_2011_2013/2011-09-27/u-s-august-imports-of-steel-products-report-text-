Following is the text of the U.S.
steel report from the Commerce Department:  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that preliminary August
steel imports were $2.7 billion (2.2 million metric tons).  This
was a decrease of $0.2 billion (0.1 million metric tons) from
the preliminary July totals of $2.9 billion (2.3 million metric
tons).  The August change in steel imports based on metric tonnage
reflected a decrease primarily in hot rolled sheets; an increase
occurred in blooms, billets, and slabs. Decreases occurred
primarily with  Korea ,  Australia , and Russia; an increase
occurred primarily with  Brazil .  The year to date final statistics through July 2011 showed steel
imports of 15.7 million metric tons compared with 12.8 million
metric tons through July 2010. The largest commodity increase
occurred primarily in blooms, billets, and slabs. The largest
country increases occurred primarily with Brazil.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department      http://www.bea.gov   To contact the reporter on this story:
