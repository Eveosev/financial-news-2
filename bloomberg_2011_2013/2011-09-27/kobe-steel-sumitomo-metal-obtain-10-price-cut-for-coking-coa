Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd. (5405)  and
 Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) ,  Japan â€™s third- and fourth-largest steelmakers,
obtained a 10 percent reduction in the price of coking coal, a
key raw material.  Sumitomo Metal agreed to pay  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  about $285 a ton for the three months starting Oct.
1, compared with $315 a ton this quarter, according to an e-
mailed statement. Kobe Steel settled a deal with suppliers at
about $285 a metric ton, Ryuichi Nakagami, a spokesman for the
Kobe-based company, said today by telephone.  Coking coal prices are declining from the April-to-June
quarter, when steelmakers paid a record $330 a ton after supply
from  Australia  was disrupted by heavy rain and flooding. Mining
companies last year scrapped a decades-old system of annual
contracts and switched to quarterly accords.  Sumitomo Metal  also agreed with BHP to buy half of its
coking coal on a monthly basis and the rest through quarterly
contracts, the steelmaker said.  Japanese steelmakers settled coking coal deals with Anglo
American, the Nikkei newspaper reported earlier today, without
saying where it obtained the information.  To contact the reporters on this story:
