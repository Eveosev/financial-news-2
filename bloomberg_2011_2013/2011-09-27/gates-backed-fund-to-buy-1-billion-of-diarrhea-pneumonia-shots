A fund backed by  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) 
Chairman Bill Gates will buy more than $1 billion of vaccines
from  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ,  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and Merck & Co. to prevent
children from dying in 37 of the poorest nations.  The  GAVI Alliance  will pay for shots against rotavirus and
pneumococcal disease, the leading killers of children in Africa,
the Geneva-based organization said in an e-mailed statement
today. GAVI said it’s buying the vaccines at a discount of as
much as 90 percent to the price in rich countries.  The inoculations protect against two diseases that each
kill more than half a million children every year, GAVI said.
Wealthy nations donated $4.3 billion to purchase the vaccines as
part of a plan to immunize 250 million children by 2015.  “The death toll of rotavirus and pneumococcal infections
in  Africa  is particularly devastating,” Seth Berkley, GAVI’s
chief executive officer, said in the statement. “Immunization
enables good health and healthy people are more productive and
ultimately fuel economic growth.”  GAVI, formerly known as the Global Alliance for Vaccines
and Immunisation, estimates that it has prevented more than 5
million deaths since its founding at the World Economic Forum in
2000. The alliance is backed by governments, the World Bank, the
 World Health Organization  and the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
