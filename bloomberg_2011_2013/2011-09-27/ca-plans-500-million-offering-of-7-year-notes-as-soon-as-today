HCA Inc., the biggest U.S. hospital
chain, sold $500 million of seven-year bonds as high-yield
issuance revives.  Proceeds may be used to buy Colorado Health Foundation’s
ownership interest in a joint venture that operates seven
hospitals and 13 ambulatory surgery centers in and around
Denver, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The 8 percent notes yield 652 basis points, or 6.52
percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nashville, Tennessee-based HCA tapped the high-yield, high-
risk bond market for the second time this year after issuing $5
billion of notes on July 26 in the biggest junk debt offering
since 2008. Companies have sold $5.1 billion of the securities
this month through yesterday, compared with $1 billion in
August, Bloomberg data show.  Barclays Plc, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of  Canada  and  Wells Fargo & Co .
managed the sale, according to the filing.  HCA agreed to purchase the stake in the HCA-HealthONE LLC
joint venture for $1.45 billion, the company said June 15 in a
statement distributed by  Business Wire .  The company is graded B3 by Moody’s Investors Service. High
yield, or junk, debt is rated below Baa3 by Moody’s and less
than BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s . HCA was taken private in a $33
billion leveraged buyout in 2006 by KKR & Co., Bain Capital LLC,
Merrill Lynch & Co. and company co-founder Thomas F. Frist Jr.
The company raised $3.79 billion in its initial public offering
in March.  Editors: Pierre Paulden, Alan Goldstein  To contact the reporter on this story:
