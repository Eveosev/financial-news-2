Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) , the world’s
third-biggest maker of personal computers, will team up with
Compal Electronics Inc. to make laptops in China as it looks to
boost production.  The two companies may invest a combined $300 million in the
venture in the eastern Chinese city of Hefei over the next 18
months, they said in an e-mailed statement today. Lenovo climbed
11 percent, the most since May 2009, to HK$4.96 at the 4 p.m.
close in Hong Kong trading, while Compal rose 2.2 percent to
NT$30.15 in Taipei.  Lenovo, which acquired the PC division of  International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  in 2005 to expand outside China, is
boosting production and expects to overtake  Dell Inc. (DELL)  this year
as the second-biggest vendor globally. Compal, based in Taipei,
is the world’s second-biggest contract maker of laptop computers
and a supplier to Lenovo’s rivals, including Hewlett-Packard Co.
and Acer Inc.  Lenovo will hold 51 percent of the venture and Compal will
own the rest, according to the statement. The venture is
expected to start “full-scale” production by the end of 2012,
the companies said.  Lenovo, with headquarters in Beijing and North Carolina,
acquired control of Medion AG and the PC operations of  NEC Corp. (6701) 
this year to expand in Germany and Japan.  Lenovo accounted for 12 percent of global shipments of PCs
in the quarter ended June 30, up from 9.7 percent in the
previous three months, according to research company Gartner
Inc. Hewlett-Packard, the industry leader, fell to 17.5 percent
from 17.6 percent, while second-ranked Dell Inc. rose to 12.5
percent from 11.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
