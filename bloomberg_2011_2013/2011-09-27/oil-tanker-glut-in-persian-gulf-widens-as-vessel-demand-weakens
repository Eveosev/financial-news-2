A glut of supertankers seeking to
load crude from ports and terminals in the  Persian Gulf  widened
as demand for vessels weakened.  There are 25 percent more very large crude carriers, or
VLCCs, available for hire over the next 30 days than there are
cargoes, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of five shipbrokers and two shipowners today. That’s five
percentage points more than last week, and just three percentage
points less than the highest level over the last 12 months.  Global demand for supertankers will expand 5.2 percent this
year to 144.3 million deadweight tons, according to Clarkson
Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world’s largest
shipbroker. The fleet will swell almost twice as fast, expanding
9.9 percent to 176.9 million tons, it estimates.  Daily losses for VLCCs on the benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-
Japan voyage narrowed to $1,826 yesterday from minus $2,251
Sept. 23, according to the London-based Baltic Exchange. The
bourse’s earnings estimates don’t reflect speed alterations that
can cut fuel consumption and reduce losses for owners.  Charter rates as measured in industry standard Worldscale
terms were unchanged for the second straight session at 44.96
points yesterday. The wider Baltic Dirty Tanker Index decreased
0.1 percent to 693.  To contact the reporter on this story:
