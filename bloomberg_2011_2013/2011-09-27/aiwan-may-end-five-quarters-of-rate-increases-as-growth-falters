Taiwan  will probably leave
borrowing costs unchanged tomorrow, snapping a series of five
straight quarterly increases, as a faltering global recovery
slows an economic expansion that relies on exports.  The central bank will keep the discount rate on 10-day
loans to banks at 1.875 percent, according to 14 of the 17
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Three predicted policy
makers will raise the key rate by 0.125 percentage point to 2
percent after lifting it by that amount from a record low in
every quarter starting in June 2010.  Central banks from  New Zealand  to  South Korea  kept their
benchmark rates unchanged this month, as  Europe ’s debt crisis
and a struggling U.S. economy dimmed the outlook for Asia-
Pacific exporters. A further decline in Taipei home prices last
month from a record earlier this year and slowing export-order
growth have eased inflation pressures, weakening the case for
another rate increase.  “Sovereign debt dramas in both the U.S. and Europe and the
global economic uncertainty look set to persist for the rest of
2011,” said Donna Kwok, an economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in
 Hong Kong . “With inflationary pressures under control, Taiwan’s
central bank can well afford to keep the policy rate at 1.875
percent.”  The Taiex stock index rose 0.8 percent today, paring this
year’s decline to 20 percent. The  Taiwan dollar  was little
changed at NT$30.426 against its U.S. counterpart at 3:02 p.m.
local time, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The local dollar
weakened the most in more than 10 years on Sept. 22, dropping
1.4 percent.  Weaker Growth  Taiwan’s government last month cut its forecast for 2011
growth to 4.81 percent from 5.01 percent and said the expansion
will slow to 4.58 percent in 2012. That’s less than half the
growth pace in 2010 of 10.9 percent, which was the fastest
expansion in  Asia  behind  Singapore ’s, according to  International
Monetary Fund  data.  The administration also lowered its prediction for
inflation this year to 1.59 percent from 1.89 percent. Consumer
prices gained 0.96 percent last year.  Recent reports showed Taiwan’s inflation climbed a less-
than-estimated 1.34 percent in August, while industrial
production also rose a weaker-than-forecast 3.88 percent last
month.  Overseas sales account for about two-thirds of the island’s
$355 billion gross domestic product and help to drive factory
output. The economy expanded 5.02 percent in the three months
through June from a year earlier, the slowest pace since a 1.21
percent contraction in the third quarter of 2009.  Lowering Production  Taoyuan, Taiwan-based  Quanta Computer Inc. (2382) , the world’s
biggest custom manufacturer of  notebook computers , said last
week it offered severance packages to some employees as it
adjusts production.  Quanta will offer early retirement to more than 1,000
workers at its Linkou plant, after poor sales of client  Research
In Motion Ltd. (RIM) ’s Playbook tablet computers, the Taipei-based
Commercial Times reported Sept. 21.  To deter housing speculators, Taiwan in June began imposing
a 15 percent tax on some residential homes sold within a year of
purchase, and a 10 percent levy on some sold within two years.  Central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan and the policy board
have also tightened mortgage lending rules to fight real-estate
speculation.  The average price of existing homes in Taipei fell 1.5
percent to NT$532,000 ($17,464) per ping, equivalent to 36
square feet, in August, after declining the previous month from
a record NT$556,000 in June, according to  Sinyi Realty Co. (9940) , the
island’s biggest real-estate brokerage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
