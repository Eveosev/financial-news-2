Royal Philips Electronics NV has to
take more risk while making sure research departments produce
results rather than just concepts, Chief Executive Officer Frans  van Houten .  “We have to create a highway rather than a road full of
speed bumps,” Van Houten said at an innovation event, where
Philips revealed new products such as a skin rejuvenation laser
device, nurturing products and its latest LED-lamps.  Van Houten is also pushing for less complexity, meaning
divisions have to improve collaboration.  The CEO is deepening cost cuts to streamline the portfolio.
The Amsterdam-based company, which is targeting savings of 800
million euros ($1.09 billion), has pulled out of television
production, and is reviewing management layers and staffing as
he tackles the company’s complexity. He’s seeking to restore
investor confidence after a 41 percent share slide this year.  At the same time the company is stepping up investments in
market penetration and innovation by an additional investment of
200 million euros. “You may get out of the crisis by
innovating”, Van Houten said today.  Van Houten stressed innovations are key for the future of
Philips as the company aims to benefit from aging population,
the rise of chronic diseases and environmental issues.  “To be successful innovators, we need to be fast. Philips
can only unlock its full potential if we get faster in
responding to customers,” Van Houten said. “An innovation that
comes too late is not an innovation at all.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
