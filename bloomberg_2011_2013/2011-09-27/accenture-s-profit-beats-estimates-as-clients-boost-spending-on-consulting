Accenture Plc (ACN) , the world’s second-
largest technology consulting company, reported fourth-quarter
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates on increasing spending
by businesses.  Net income advanced to $611.9 million, or 91 cents a share,
from $445.5 million, or 66 cents, a year earlier, the company
said today in a statement. Analysts predicted 90 cents a share,
the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Accenture also
gave 2012 forecasts exceeding projections.  Consulting revenue rose 25 percent. Accenture is benefiting
as long-term clients are boosting spending on its services
following the recession, said Joseph Foresi, a Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC analyst in  Boston . Larger rival  International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM)  also reported earnings beating estimates for the
latest quarter on demand from corporations.  “We were at a stage in the economic recovery where
companies wanted to turn to consultants to help them in
different aspects of their general business -- anything from
cost cutting to technology,” Foresi said.  Sales in the quarter ended Aug. 31 rose 23 percent to $6.69
billion. Analysts projected $6.53 billion on average.  Accenture, incorporated in Dublin, advanced $2.07, or 3.9
percent, to $55.72 in extended trading after closing at $53.65
on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 11
percent this year.  Monitoring Economy  Bookings for consulting projects, which represent more than
half of total revenue, were $4.16 billion, up from $3.7 billion
in the third quarter.  “While we are closely monitoring the economic environment,
we continue to see strong demand for our services,” Chief
Executive Officer Pierre Nanterme, who is based in Paris, said
in the statement.  The  International Monetary Fund  reduced its forecast for
global economic growth Sept. 20 and said  Europe  and the U.S.
risk re-entering recession if they fail to solve their financial
problems.  Per-share earnings for the year ending in August 2012 will
rise to $3.80 to $3.88, Accenture said. Analysts estimated $3.77
on average. Full-year revenue will increase 7 percent to 10
percent, the company said. Analysts projected 7.3 percent.  Accenture boosted its semi-annual dividend by 50 percent to
67.5 cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
