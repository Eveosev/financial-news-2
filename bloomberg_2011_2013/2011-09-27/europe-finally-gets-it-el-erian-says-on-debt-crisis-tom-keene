Policy makers in  Europe  now
understand the severity of the sovereign-debt crisis and the
actions that need to be taken, according to Pacific Investment
Management Co.’s Mohamed A. El-Erian.  “What I learned in Washington is that Europeans finally
get it,” El-Erian, chief executive and co-chief investment
officer at the world’s biggest manager of bond funds, said in a
radio interview today on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt. “They recognize they have deep problems
and they recognize they need to do something about it. And now
they are going back and will try to do something about it. This
was a very important wake-up call for Europe.”  Euro-region finance chiefs committed at a gathering of the
Group of 20 in Washington on Sept. 22 to boost the flexibility
of their rescue fund and “maximize its impact” by the time of
the next G-20 conclave. Euro-area finance ministers meet Oct. 3.
European Central Bank officials have indicated they will
consider expanding liquidity provisions when they meet Oct. 6.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  set the tone at
the annual meeting of the  International Monetary Fund  and  World
Bank  by warning that failure to combat the Greek-led turmoil
threatened “cascading default, bank runs and catastrophic
risk.” That gathering followed the G-20 session.  “But let’s not underestimate both the political challenges
and the engineering challenges,” El-Erian said. “There is a
lot that has to happen just today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
