Barclays Plc (BARC) â€™s U.K. and European
retail banking chief Deanna Oppenheimer is stepping down from
the post as well as from that of vice chairman of global retail
banking, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The 53-year-old American, who will remain at the bank until
the end of the year, will be replaced as U.K. retail head on
Oct. 1 by Ashok Vaswani, currently head of Barclays Africa, the
newspaper said. Her other roles will be filled by  Antony
Jenkins , chief of global retail banking, the Telegraph said.  Recently voted the second-most-influential woman in finance
by U.S. Banker magazine, Oppenheimer is believed to be planning
to move back to the U.S. and is said to be seeking a career
outside of financial services, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
