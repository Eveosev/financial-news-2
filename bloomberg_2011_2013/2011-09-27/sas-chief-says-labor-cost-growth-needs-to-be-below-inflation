SAS Group’s unions will need to
agree that labor costs should grow less than inflation for the
airline to reach its cost-cutting goals, Chief Executive Officer
Rickard Gustafson told reporters today in  Stockholm .  “We’re getting some feedback from the unions and we’re
starting to see some common ground,” he said. “Our collective
bargaining agreements are not excluded” from the company’s
cost-cut effort, he said.  While SAS foresees no job cuts “at this stage,” layoffs
could be necessary if the economy worsens, Gustafson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
