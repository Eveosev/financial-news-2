Merck & Co. and Sanofi’s cervical-
cancer vaccine is more cost-effective than a rival product made
by  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , researchers from the U.K.’s  Health
Protection Agency  found.  A dose of London-based Glaxo’s Cervarix would have to be 19
pounds ($29.70) to 35 pounds cheaper than Merck and Sanofi’s
Gardasil to be as cost-effective, according to researchers led
by Mark Jit of the HPA. The study’s results were published today
on the website of the  British Medical Journal .  Jit and colleagues, whose comparative report in 2008 led
the U.K. government to buy Cervarix, according to the journal,
decided to compare the two products again using a mathematical
model in which they plugged in the latest data available,
including evidence that Gardasil can ward off anal cancer and
genital warts. They cautioned against judging the vaccines,
which help protect against different strains of the cancer-
causing human papillomavirus, solely on price.  “Clinical and public health decisions about choice of HPV
vaccine need to take into account the whole spectrum of
differences between vaccines and the uncertainty around them,”
they wrote. Though Gardasil is comparatively cheaper, Cervarix
may better prevent deaths due to cancer, the authors said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
