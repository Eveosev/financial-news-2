Oil options volatility slipped from
the highest level in six weeks as the underlying futures
rebounded for a second day after tumbling to the lowest level
since August last week.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
November, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 46 percent at 4 p.m. in  New York 
from 49.8 percent yesterday, the highest level for the contract
nearest to expiration since Aug. 9.  Oil for November delivery increased $4.21, or 5.3 percent,
to settle at $84.45 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the biggest gain since May 9. Oil has dropped 11
percent since the end of June and is poised for the biggest
quarterly loss since 2008. Prices are down 4.9 percent this
month and 7.6 percent this year.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
November $70 puts, with 3,274 lots changing hands. The options
slipped 45 cents to 50 cents a barrel. November $75 puts, the
next-most-active options, fell 91 cents to $1.11 a barrel on
volume of 2,350. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts outnumbered calls more than 2 to 1 in electronic
trading.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occur the next business day.  December $100 calls were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 13,312 lots changing hands. They fell
1 cent to 55 cents a barrel. The next-most active options,
December $60 puts, decreased 5 cents to 87 cents a barrel on
volume of 6,582.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
49,938 contracts. Next were December $50 puts with 45,844 and
