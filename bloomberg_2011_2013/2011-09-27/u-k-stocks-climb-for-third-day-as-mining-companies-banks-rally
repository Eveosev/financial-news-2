U.K. stocks jumped by the most in
more than 16 months as investors speculated that European policy
makers will increase efforts to contain the euro zone’s debt
crisis and help stave off a Greek default.  Vedanta Resources Plc,  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  and  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) 
all surged more than 9 percent as copper snapped its longest
losing streak since December 2008.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS)  and  Old Mutual Plc (OML)  led gains in financial firms, rising at
least 5 percent.  BP Plc (BP/)  rallied with crude oil.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  jumped 204.68, or 4 percent,
to 5,294.05 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London. That’s the biggest
advance since May 2010 and extends the three-day rally to 5.6
percent. The broader FTSE All-Share Index gained 3.8 percent
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index rose 3.2 percent.  “Sentiment in equity markets has changed markedly,” said
Chris Weston, an institutional trader at IG Markets. “Traders
are suddenly becoming increasingly confident that European
leaders can now reach an agreement to successfully contain the
debt crisis.”  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said European
governments will step up their response to the debt crisis after
a chiding from counterparts around the world. His remarks, in an
interview with ABC, maintain pressure on Europe ahead of finance
minister and central bank gatherings next week.  In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel has stepped up her
defense of the euro and toned down calls to punish Greece for
its fiscal problems.  FTSE Valuation  More than $3.5 trillion was wiped from equity values
globally last week amid concern policy makers are struggling to
contain a debt crisis that has Greece on the verge of a default.
The FTSE 100 has lost 13 percent from February’s high, leaving

its companies, below the average multiple of 11.4 during the
past five years, Bloomberg data shows.  Vedanta led copper producers higher after the base metal

Exchange. The stock surged 12 percent to 1,196 pence, while

the previous four days as sliver slumped below $30 an ounce.
 Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) , a London-traded gold producer, gained
5.1 percent to 6,485 pence.  Gold and silver futures rose the most since March 2009 in
New York.  Insurers Gain  Aviva Plc (AV/) , the U.K.’s second-biggest insurer by market
value, paced gains in financial shares, jumping 4.5 percent to

New York. Royal Dutch Shell Plc rose 3.9 percent to 2,036 pence
and BG Group Plc gained 6.7 percent to 1,221 pence.  Morgan Crucible Co. jumped 9.6 percent to 252.1 pence after

attract a takeover offer.  Bellway Plc (BWY)  gained 1.3 percent to 617.5 pence and  Bovis
