Swedish insurers should review
their ability to strengthen finances if needed and make sure
their long-term commitments to customers are sustainable, the
Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority said in a letter posted
on its website today.  The financial watchdog said itâ€™s worried market
uncertainties will prompt insurance companies to sell stocks and
buy bonds which could worsen the situation for insurers that are
finding it difficult to stay solvent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
