Australia  appointed Troy Cooley as
interim cricket coach for its tour of South Africa in October
and November after Tim Nielsen stepped down last week.  Cooley, who is the head coach at Cricket Australia’s Centre
of Excellence in Brisbane, previously took charge of the
national team for three one-day matches against England in 2009.
He’s also had a stint as the team’s bowling coach.  “Troy has filled this role successfully in the past, and
has worked extensively with all players within the Australian
setup,” Cricket Australia General Manager  Michael Brown  said in
an e-mailed statement. “This appointment will therefore
allow the Australian squad continuity as they attempt to cement
their No. 1 one-day international ranking and attempt to climb
the Test rankings.”  Nielsen, who had been asked to re-apply for the head
coach’s job following a review into the team’s performances,
quit last week to take up an academy role with the South
Australia state team. Australia is scheduled to play two
Twenty20 games, three one-day matches and a two-Test series in
 South Africa  from Oct. 13.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
