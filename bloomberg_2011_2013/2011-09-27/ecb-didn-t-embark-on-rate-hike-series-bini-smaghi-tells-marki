European Central Bank Executive
Board memberLorenzo Bini Smaghi said policy makers never
signaled that they embarked on a series of interest-rate
increases, Markit Magazine reported, citing an interview.  “We never said that we were starting a series of interest
rate hikes,” Bini Smaghi was quoted as saying. “We said we
were guided by the pace of recovery. So we will continue to make
our decisions on the basis of economic developments and
inflationary pressures.”  “What the ECB has done in the past is justified by what
happened in the past,” he added. “It was due to the recovery
and the additional inflationary pressures which were emerging.
Real interest rates remain negative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
