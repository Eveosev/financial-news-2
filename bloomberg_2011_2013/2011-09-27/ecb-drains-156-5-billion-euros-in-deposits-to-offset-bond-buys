The  European Central Bank  said it
will take 156.5 billion euros ($211.8 billion) in 7-day term
deposits from euro-area banks tomorrow to neutralize the extra
money created by its bond purchases.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said it received 103 bids for the
deposits totaling 202.9 billion euros. The marginal rate was
1.15 percent. The 156.5 billion euros the ECB will absorb
corresponds to the total amount of extra liquidity its bond-
purchase program has created since it began in May last year.  The ECB, which sterilizes its bond purchases to ensure they  don’t fuel inflation, was forced to start buying Italian and
Spanish securities on Aug. 8 to contain  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis. The central bank settled purchases worth 3.95 billion
euros last week, down from 9.79 billion euros the previous week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
