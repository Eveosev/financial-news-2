South Korean manufacturers’
confidence held at a 21-month low as  Europe ’s debt woes and a
faltering U.S. recovery cloud the global business outlook.  An index measuring expectations for October was 86,
unchanged from a September reading that was the lowest level
since December 2009, the Bank of Korea said in a statement in
 Seoul  today. A measure of expectations at non-manufacturing
companies rose to 86 from 83.  The survey, conducted Sept. 14-21, was based on responses
from 1,620 manufacturers and 896 non-manufacturers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
