Brazil â€™s government may reduce to
zero the rate of a tax on foreign-exchange derivatives that aims
to avoid excessive speculation in the  currency markets , Folha de
S. Paulo reported, without saying where it got the information.  The government believes the current rate of 1 percent no
longer makes sense as banks are ceasing their transactions
against the dollar, according to the newspaper. It wants to keep
the tax in existence to help avoid speculation that could damage
the Brazilian economy, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
