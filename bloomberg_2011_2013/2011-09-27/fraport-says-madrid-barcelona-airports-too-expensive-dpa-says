Fraport AG, the owner of  Frankfurt 
airport, sees Madrid and Barcelona airports as unattractive
acquisitions at the current price,  Deutsche Presse-Agentur  cited
Chief Executive Officer Stefan Schulte as saying.  Fraport will focus expansion efforts on  Brazil , where
Schulte believes the German company can add value to an
“inefficient” airport infrastructure, DPA cited Schulte as
telling journalists in Frankfurt.  Spain ’s government is seeking a combined sum of
5.3 billion euros ($7.1 billion) for the two airports and has
set Oct. 31 as the deadline for bids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
