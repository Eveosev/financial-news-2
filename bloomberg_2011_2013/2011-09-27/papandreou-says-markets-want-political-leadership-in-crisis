Financial markets are looking for
stronger leadership from policy makers to help Greece overcome
the current debt crisis, Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
said.  Greeks ask whether this is sisyphean task or whether the
country can surmount the crisis, Papandreou said in a speech to
a German industry federation event in Berlin today. “My answer
is yes we can,” he said. “Greece has the potential,  Europe  has
the potential,” and through global cooperation it can be
achieved.   The crisis “offers a unique chance to bring in important
reforms,” he said. “Markets are looking for stronger political
leadership to restore confidence.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
