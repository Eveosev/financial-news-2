Uganda ’s shilling weakened for the
first time in three days against the dollar as companies sought
the greenback after the local currency appreciated 1.5 percent
against it in the last two days.  The currency of East Africa’s third-biggest economy
depreciated as much as 1.1 percent, the most since Sept. 22, and
was 0.8 percent weaker at 2,861.5 per dollar by 10.31 a.m. in
the capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The shilling weakened because there is always outstanding
demand,” Benon Okwenje, the head of  currency trading  at Stanbic
Bank Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “People are
seeing these rates as good enough to buy the dollar after the
shilling gained in the last few days.”  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,897.50 against the dollar on
Sept. 23, the weakest since June 1993, as concern  Europe ’s banks
will face funding problems should  Greece  default on its debt
spurred investors to pull money from emerging and frontier
markets. The currency appreciated in the last two days after the
central bank sold dollars and non-governmental organizations
received dollars from their funders.  The currency slipped 19 percent this year to the dollar,
making it the second-worst performer after  Kenya ’s shilling. A
surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation to an 18-year
high of 21.4 percent in August from 18.8 percent in July, the
Uganda Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
