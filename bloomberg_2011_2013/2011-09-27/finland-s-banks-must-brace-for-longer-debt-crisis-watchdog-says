Finland ’s financial institutions
must take steps to protect themselves from a protracted debt
crisis, the country’s financial watchdog said.  Banks operating in Finland, including  Nordea Bank AB (NDA)  and
Sampo Bank, a unit of Danske Bank A/S, face “significantly
increased” risks from the debt crisis that threatens the
financial system of the euro area, the Financial Supervisory
Authority said in a report published today in Helsinki.  “The Finnish financial sector must prepare for a
prolongation of the debt crisis,” Anneli Tuominen, who heads
the supervisor, said in the statement. Even so, “the capital
adequacy of the sector as a whole is currently fairly good.”  The country’s lenders had a capital adequacy ratio of 14.4
percent and the aggregated core Tier 1 ratio was 13.2 percent on
June 30, the financial supervisor said. Banks’ deposit stock has
risen by 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion) this year, strengthening
funding structures, the watchdog said.  Finnish banks have retained access to short-term funding
“without difficulty,” even as financing costs have risen.
Profitability of the banks is also being eroded by narrow
margins for mortgages and the low level of  interest rates , the
supervisor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
