Banca Popolare di Milano Scarl (PMI) , the
oldest Italian cooperative bank, will scale back the maximum
size of a planned rights offer to 800 million euros ($1.1
billion), a person with knowledge of the matter said.  Pop. Milano, which hired  Mediobanca SpA (MB)  in April to manage
the sale, will complete the offer by the end of the year, said
the person, who asked not be named because the decision hasn’t
been officially approved. The bank’s board, which approved a
sale of as much as 1.2 billion euros on April 19, is expected to
announce the size of the revised offer after meeting today.  The bank is selling assets and cutting costs after the  Bank
of Italy  urged Pop. Milano to bolster capital. Second-quarter
profit at the Milan-based lender slumped 98 percent as
provisions for bad loans almost doubled.  Pop. Milano will also approve the replacement of its single
board with supervisory and management boards after the central
bank asked the lender to limit the influence of labor unions on
decision-making, the person said. The changes, which need to be
approved by shareholders, will separate management from investor
control while maintaining a cooperative ownership.  The bank’s shares rose 12 percent to 1.61 euros in Milan
trading, increasing its market value to 666 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
