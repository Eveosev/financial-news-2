The Polish central bank’s
intervention to support the zloty on Sept. 23 may have taught
speculators a lesson and helped curb price growth, central bank
Governor Marek Belka was quoted as saying yesterday by Reuters.  “We hate the weak zloty because it feeds inflation,”
Belka said during comments at  Harvard University  in Cambridge,
 Massachusetts , Reuters reported. Belka described the financial
market as “a nuthouse” in which small currencies fluctuate
violently.  “The guys who were in the business of speculating against
the zloty probably lost a lot of money,” Reuters quoted Belka
as saying. “If you choose to overtake on a two-way street, at
the last moment you might notice there is a big truck coming.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
