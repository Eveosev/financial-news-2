Philipp Roesler, who heads German
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Free Democratic coalition ally, urged
lawmakers to approve expanding the European Financial Stability
Facility’s powers when they vote on Sept. 29.  The proposed changes are “important and necessary,”
Roesler said at an industry conference in Berlin today,
referring to the vote scheduled in the lower house of the German
parliament.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
