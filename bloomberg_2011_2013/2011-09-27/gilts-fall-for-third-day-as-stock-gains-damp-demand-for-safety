Gilts declined for a third day as
speculation European policy makers will announce new measures to
contain the region’s sovereign-debt crisis damped demand for
safer securities.  Yields on two- and 10-year securities climbed to the
highest level in almost two weeks after  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said  Germany  will provide all help it can to stabilize  Greece .
U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said yesterday
 Europe ’s officials will step up efforts to resolve the crisis
that threatens global economic growth. The pound strengthened
for the third day against the dollar and yen as stock gains
sapped the appetite for the U.S. currency.  “There’s improved risk sentiment and safe-haven bids are
evaporating,” said Eric Wand, a London-based fixed-income
strategist at Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets. “The market is
hoping that the European politicians are going to come up with
the goods.”  The yield on the 10-year gilt climbed 10 basis points to
2.53 percent at 4:25 p.m. in  London  after reaching 2.57 percent,
the highest since Sept. 15. The 3.75 percent security due in
September 2021 fell 0.97, or 9.70 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,570) face amount, to 110.625.  The two-year yield was little changed at 0.56 percent,
after reaching 0.59 percent, also the most since Sept. 15.  Merkel urged German lawmakers to back an enhancement of the
euro rescue fund in a vote in two days. “Whatever Germany can
offer in terms of help, we will offer,” she said during a
speech in Berlin. “If Europe isn’t doing well, then over the
middle term Germany won’t do well,” she said.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained for a third day, rising
4.1 percent, and the  FTSE 100 index (UKX)  advanced 3.8 percent.  Pound Gains  The pound rose versus the dollar and the yen even after a
measure of U.K. shop sales declined this month to the lowest
level since May 2010.  The  Confederation of British Industry  said its retail-sales
index slid to minus 15 in September from minus 14 in August.
Stores expect sales to fall at a “broadly similar pace” in
October, the CBI said.  Sterling appreciated 0.8 percent to $1.5681 after touching
$1.5706, its highest level since Sept. 21, and rose 1 percent to
120.08 yen. The pound was at 86.78 pence per euro, from 86.94
pence yesterday.  The pound has gained 1.2 percent in the past three months,
trimming its decline over the past 12 months to 4.6 percent, the
worst performer among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.  The U.K. Debt Management Office said today it sold 4.5
billion pounds of bonds maturing in July 2052 via banks at a
yield of 3.758 percent. The bonds were priced to yield two basis
points more than the 4.25 percent gilt maturing in 2049, the DMO
said in an e-mailed statement. Local investors bought 87 percent
of the securities on offer, the DMO said.  Gilts have returned 11 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German debt has gained 8.3 percent
and U.S. Treasuries rose 9 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
