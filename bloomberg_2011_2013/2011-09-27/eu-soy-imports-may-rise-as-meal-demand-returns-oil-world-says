European Union soybean imports may
increase for the first time in four years after dry weather
curbed domestic rapeseed production, Oil World said.  Soybean imports may rise 3 percent to 13.6 million metric
tons in the marketing year that started on Sept. 1, the first
increase since 2008, the Hamburg-based researcher said in a
report today. Crushings, or processing, of the oilseed also will
gain 3 percent, according to the report. Stockpiles will gain
4.6 partly because of more imports, it said.  “Soybean demand is likely to recover in 2011-12,
benefiting from reduced supplies and crushings of rapeseed,”
Oil World said. “The significant decline of soybean crushings
by 15 percent during the past three seasons is coming to an
end.”  Before today, soybean futures declined 14 percent this
month, partly on speculation that the European recession will
cut demand for raw materials used to make food. Soy meal futures
declined 15 percent over the same period.  Profits for companies that process soybeans into meal may
have fallen on reduced demand from animal feeders and industrial
users, Oil World said. Soy meal demand should recover and
processing will rise 3.3 percent, according to the report.  “Soybean crush margins were under pressure lately, falling
to unattractive levels,” the researcher said. “This was
partly caused by the slowdown of soya meal demand in the
European Union. We expect a recovery in soya meal consumption
partly based on less competition from other oil meals.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
