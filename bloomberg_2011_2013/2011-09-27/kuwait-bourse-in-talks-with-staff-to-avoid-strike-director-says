Kuwait Stock Exchange is holding
talks with employees to avert a strike planned for tomorrow,
said Hamed al-Saif, the director and head of the exchange.  “There’s still negotiations with the staff because we
believe they have rights,” al-Saif said in a phone interview
today. “We’re trying not to allow this strike.”  Stock exchange employees are planning to strike for two
hours tomorrow morning to protest against a decision by Commerce
Minister Amani Boresli affecting wages, Al-Rai reported today. A
decision on the employees’ salaries and benefits associated with
their transfer to the  Capital Markets Authority  was taken by the
authority, while Boresli has refused to hold a stock market
committee meeting to decide on the issue, Al-Rai reported.  “I don’t know the consequences” if the strike went ahead,
al-Saif said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
