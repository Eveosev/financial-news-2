Growth in the euro area “cannot be
taken for granted,” European Central Bank council member Erkki Liikanen said.  Uncertainty in the economic outlook has increased and
faster-than-expected inflation poses risks to the 17-nation
region’s growth, Liikanen said in a  copy of a speech  posted on
the Helsinki-based Bank of  Finland ’s website.  “Next year, inflationary pressures are projected to
abate,” Liikanen said. “Ultimately, it is the responsibility
of monetary policy to ensure that this moderation will take
place.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
