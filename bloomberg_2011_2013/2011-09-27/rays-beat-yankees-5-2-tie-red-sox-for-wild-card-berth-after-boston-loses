The  Tampa Bay Rays  tied the  Boston
Red Sox  for the American League’s wild card playoff berth with
two games left in Major League Baseball’s regular season.  The Rays, who trailed Boston by 9 1/2 games on Sept. 2,
beat the New York Yankees 5-2 last night in the opener of a
season-ending three-game series at Tropicana Field in St.
Petersburg,  Florida .  After Tampa Bay closed out its fourth win in five games,
many fans stuck around to watch and cheer the end of Boston’s 6-
3 loss to Baltimore on the big screen at Tropicana Field. The
Red Sox have a 6-19 record this month.  “I don’t know how they’re feeling in any other clubhouse,
but we’re pretty loose and I think that’s why we’ve been playing
so well over the past couple months,” said Rays pitcher  James Shields , who held the AL East-champion Yankees to two runs over
8 2/3 innings last night. “This is what baseball is all about.
It’s exciting.”  Tampa Bay hosts the Yankees in its final two games today
and tomorrow, while Boston plays two more games in Baltimore.  The Rays and Red Sox both have 89-71 records in the chase
for the AL wild card, which goes to the division runner-up with
the best record. The Los Angeles Angels were eliminated from
contention last night with a 4-3 loss to the AL West-leading
Texas Rangers that dropped them to 86-74.  The Yankees (97-63), Rangers (94-66) and Detroit Tigers
(93-67) had previously clinched the first three AL playoff spots
as division winners.  Braves Keep Lead  The  Atlanta Braves  retained a  one-game lead  over  St. Louis 
in the National League wild card race when the Cardinals lost to
the Houston Astros 5-4 in 10 innings last night.  The Braves lost 4-2 to the  Philadelphia Phillies  and a win
by the Cardinals would have left the teams tied for the wild
card. Atlanta held an 8 1/2-game lead on Sept. 2 before St.
Louis won 16 of 22 games.  The Cardinals erased a three-run deficit last night to
force extra innings before losing in the 10th when Brian Bogusevic scored on a bunt.  Atlanta (89-71) has two games left at home against a
Phillies team that leads the major leagues with 100 wins. The
Cardinals finish the season with two road games against the
Astros, whose 56-104 record is the worst in the majors.  The Phillies,  Milwaukee Brewers  (94-66) and Arizona
Diamondbacks (93-67) had locked up NL playoff berths as division
winners.  Matt Kemp hit his 38th home run of the season to lift the
 Los Angeles Dodgers  to a 4-2 win over the Diamondbacks and
continue his pursuit of the NL’s Triple Crown. Kemp leads the NL
with 38 homers and 123 runs batted in, and is third in the
league with a .324 batting average. Milwaukee’s Ryan Braun and
Jose Reyes of the  New York Mets  lead the NL with a .334 average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
