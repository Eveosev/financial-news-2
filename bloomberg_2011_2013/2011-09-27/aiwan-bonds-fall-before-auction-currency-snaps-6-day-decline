Taiwan’s government bonds dropped
for a second day and the local currency snapped a six-day losing
streak on optimism European leaders will come up with a solution
to the region’s debt crisis.  Benchmark stock indexes rallied today across Asia,
following gains in U.S. and European equities yesterday, after
the  European Central Bank  was said to be considering restarting
covered-bond purchases and further measures to ease monetary
conditions. The  Taiwan dollar  has lost 5.4 percent this quarter
on concern a faltering U.S. recovery and  Europe ’s debt crisis
will hurt the island’s export-led economy.  “Better  market sentiment  today supported stocks and
reduced demand for bonds,” said Artie Yao, a fixed-income
trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei. “But economic
prospects are still bleak. I think investors will stock up on
bonds for safety.”  The yield on the 1.25 percent notes due September 2021 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.29 percent as
of the 1:30 p.m. close in Taipei, prices from Gretai Securities
Market show. That’s the biggest jump in rates for benchmark 10-
year yields in a month.  Taiwan  sold NT$35 billion ($1.2 billion) of 10-year debt at
a yield of 1.288 percent today, the lowest rate for an issue of
that maturity since September 2010.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.4 percent to NT$30.456
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency touched NT$30.670 on Sept. 23, the weakest level since
Dec. 9.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.397 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
