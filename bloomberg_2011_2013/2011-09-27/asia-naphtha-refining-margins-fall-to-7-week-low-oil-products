(Corrects headline to show refining margins dropped.)  Refining profits on naphtha in  Asia 
fell to the lowest level in seven weeks. Reliance Industries
Ltd. sold two gasoil cargoes in Singapore, the region’s largest
oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Glencore International AG sold 25,000 metric tons of
naphtha for the second half of November to BP Plc at $913.50 a
ton, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring
transactions on the Platts window.  Total SA sold two cargoes, each containing 50,000 barrels
of 95-RON gasoline to Mercuria Energy at $119.40 a barrel, the
survey showed.  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell to $91.56 a ton at 5:50 p.m. Singapore time. That’s
the narrowest spread since Aug. 5, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil with 10 parts-per-million of sulfur, known as ultra-
low-sulfur diesel, changed hands at least three times in
 Singapore , according to the Bloomberg News survey. Reliance
Industries sold 150,000 barrels to BP at $2.70 a barrel over
October prices, and a similar cargo to Royal Dutch Shell Plc at
$2.80 a barrel over benchmark quotes. Shell also bought from
Vitol Group at a $2.70 premium.  Hin Leong Trading Pte purchased 250,000 barrels of 0.5
percent sulfur gasoil from Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. at
5 cents a barrel over quotes, the survey showed.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude fell 89 cents
to $15.52 a barrel at 3:40 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack spread, a measure of
refining profit, was the narrowest since Sept. 15.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose 10 cents to $1.90 a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade widened for a third day, meaning
it is profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 71 cents to
$5.06 a barrel at 3:40 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
That’s the biggest gap in a week, signaling losses from turning
crude into residual products are increasing.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade dropped 75 cents to $7.50 a ton, PVM data showed. This
viscosity spread is the narrowest in five weeks, meaning higher-
quality fuel oil has declined more than bunker, or marine fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
