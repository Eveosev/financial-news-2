Joint action by  Poland ’s central
bank and state-owned Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego on Sept. 23
sent an “important signal” to investors and has stopped
speculation against the zloty, Finance Minister Jacek Rostowski
said today in an interview on Radio RMF FM.  Rostowski said he agreed with central bank Governor Marek
Belka that the action was against “herd behavior” by investors
and was not aimed at supporting any particular level for the
currency.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
