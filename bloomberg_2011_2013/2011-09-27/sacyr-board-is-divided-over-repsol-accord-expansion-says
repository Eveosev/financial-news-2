The board of  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV) ,
the Spanish builder that´s the largest shareholder in  Repsol YPF
SA (REP) , is divided over plans to boost influence over the oil
company after an emergency meeting yesterday,  Expansion 
reported, without citing anyone.  Sacyr stockholder Juan Abello, who together with Demetrio Carceller owns about 25 percent of the company, declined to sign
a letter to Repsol demanding it reveal how much it’s spending to
shield itself from a shareholder pact between Sacyr and Pemex to
jointly vote a combined 29.8 percent of Repsol shares, the
newspaper said.  During the meeting, 7 board members, including Matia Cortes
and Diogo Alves, voted against Sacyr’s proposal to continue with
the shareholder pact, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
