Orascom Construction Industries (OCIC) ,
Egypt’s biggest publicly traded builder, fell to the lowest
level in more then six months after its bid to acquire  BASF SE (BAS) ’s
nitrogen-fertilizer assets failed.  Shares of the Cairo-based company dropped 4.2 percent to
218.94 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo, the
lowest level since March 24. That brought the stock’s decline
this quarter to 19 percent. Egypt’s benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
retreated 1.3 percent today.  Ludwigshafen, Germany-based BASF agreed to sell the bulk of
its nitrogen-fertilizer assets to OAO EuroChem in a deal valued
at 700 million euros ($947 million), selecting the Russian crop
nutrient supplier over Orascom Construction and Norway’s Yara
International ASA.  “There are a lot of other attractive fertilizer assets
around the world that can provide favourable returns,” said
Muhammad El Ebrashi, an analyst at Commercial International
Brokerage Co. in Cairo who has a “buy” recommendation on the
stock. “Investors may be concerned about a possible increase in
energy costs if  Egypt  lifts natural gas subsidies.”  Orascom has tried to expand its fertilizer business as
rising food prices spur farmers to plant more crops. The company
has fertilizer assets in the Netherlands,  Algeria  and the U.S.
The strongest growth in the company’s second-quarter margins
came from Egyptian subsidiaries that make nutrients, investment
bank EFG-Hermes Holding SAE said in a Sept. 6 note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
