California-blend gasoline slipped
from its highest premium to futures in more than two weeks on
speculation that refinery issues over the weekend did little to
change supply in the market.  The premium for Carbob in  Los Angeles  fell 4 cents to 18
cents above gasoline futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 4:10 p.m. East Coast time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose 6.76 cents to $2.816
a gallon.  BP Plc said its 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery may
flare gases until next week.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  flared over the
weekend at its 135,000-barrel-a-day Wilmington refinery after a
power dip, and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  released sulfur dioxide at its
128,000-barrel-a-day Rodeo refinery in Northern  California .  “It looks like, after all that happened, no refinery
buyers showed up,” said David Hackett, president of energy
consultant Stillwater Associates in  Irvine , California.  Gasoline for October delivery also rose the most in four
months to settle at $2.6955 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange months on speculation that European governments will
contain the region’s debt crisis.  The premium for Carbob in  San Francisco  fell 5 cents to
19.5 cents a gallon over futures.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Portland ,  Oregon , narrowed 6 cents to 22 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
