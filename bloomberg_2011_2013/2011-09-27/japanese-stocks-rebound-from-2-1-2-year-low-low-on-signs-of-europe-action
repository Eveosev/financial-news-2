Japan ’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
gained the most since March, rebounding from a 2 ½-year low, on
speculation European leaders will act to prevent the region’s
sovereign-debt crisis from getting worse.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  advanced 3.4 percent
after European and U.S. lenders surged yesterday following a
report that the European Central Bank may resume buying some
loan-backed bonds.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that depends on
 Europe  for about a third of its sales, climbed 4.3 percent.
 Bridgestone Corp. (5108)  and other makers of tires surged on
speculation auto demand in  China  will boost sales.  “Market psychology got a little boost on speculation the
ECB will take some action,” said Yoshihiro Ito, chief
strategist at Okasan Online Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Still,
it’s too early to say the market has hit bottom.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  rose 2.8 percent to 8,609.95 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, advancing the most since March 22. The broader
Topix gained 2.7 percent to 748.55. The gauge has fallen 17
percent this year amid concern U.S. growth is sputtering and
Europe’s debt crisis will damage the banking system, damping
demand in two of Japan’s biggest markets.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.6
percent today. The index gained 2.3 percent yesterday after a
euro-region central bank official said the ECB may discuss
buying some loan-backed securities from banks at a policy
meeting on Oct. 6. Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
rose at least 4.6 percent.  Lenders Advance  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Japan’s second-largest
publicly traded lender, climbed 3.4 percent to 2,148 yen.
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. gained 4.3 percent to 343
yen. Japan’s biggest bank by market capitalization also got a
boost after Daiwa Securities Group Inc. raised the lender’s
investment rating to “outperform” from “neutral.”  The  European Central Bank  may also discuss cutting  interest
rates  and offering 12-month loans to banks again at the Oct. 6
policy meeting, according to the official. A spokesman for the
Frankfurt-based ECB declined to comment.  Japanese exporters to Europe advanced as the yen weakened
against the shared currency. Canon gained 4.3 percent to 3,505
yen. Olympus Corp., an optical-equipment maker that generates
more than 20 percent of its sales in Europe, jumped 5.2 percent
to 2,390 yen. Shares also rose after Cosmo Securities Co.
initiated coverage of the endoscope maker with a rating of
“neutral plus” and a price target of 2,800 yen.  Bridgestone, Tepco  The euro gained to as much as 103.57 yen today in  Tokyo ,
compared with 102.18 at the close of  stock trading  yesterday. A
stronger euro boosts the value of some income for Japanese
exporters.  Bridgestone and other tiremakers advanced the most among
the 33 Topix industry groups on speculation sales will grow amid
record demand for cars in China and the biggest increase in
Japanese vehicle production in three decades.  Bridgestone, Japan’s biggest tiremaker, added 6.6 percent
to 1,727 yen. Smaller Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. gained 6.2
percent to 955 yen as China’s vehicle sales exceeded the
combined total of General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG in the
first half. Also, Japanese car output more than doubled in three
months as factories reopened after the March earthquake.  Toshiba Corp. and Tokyo Electron Ltd., two Japanese
companies among many that go ex-dividend tomorrow, advanced at
least 3.6 percent. Today was the last day to buy shares in the
companies and still get a first-half dividend.  Among decliners, Tokyo Electric Power Co. dropped 6.2
percent to 243 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported the cost
of compensating victims of the Fukushima nuclear disaster may
exceed 3 trillion yen ($39.3 billion).  To contact the reporters on this story:
