Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  garnered the support of 151 lawmakers in a vote to
approve a new property tax, according to a tally of votes in the
parliament in  Athens  today.  The result, if confirmed, will bolster his chances of
meeting 2011 budget targets and securing further international
financial aid for the country.  The vote is being televised live on state-run Vouli TV and
is continuing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
