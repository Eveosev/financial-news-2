Turkey ’s central bank reiterated
that it may need to loosen all policy instruments if the global
debt crisis deepens and the domestic economy stalls.  Total demand conditions in the third quarter are moving in
the “desired direction” alongside a significant slowdown in
imports, the Ankara-based bank said today in the minutes of the
Sept. 20 rates meeting at which it kept the one-week repo
lending rate unchanged at 5.75 percent.  Import tax increases may cause an increase in clothing
prices in the fourth quarter, the statement said. A slowdown in
industrial  job creation  is likely to persist, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
