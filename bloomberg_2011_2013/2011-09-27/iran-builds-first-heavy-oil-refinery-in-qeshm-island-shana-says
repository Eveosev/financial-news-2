Iran  is building its first refinery
able to process so-called heavy crude in the southern Qeshm
Island, the Oil Ministry said, citing an official at the
Research Institute of the Petroleum Industry.  The refinery, with capacity to produce as much as 30,000
barrels a day of light oil products, will be operational by
early 2013, Mansour Bazmi, the head of refinery research at the
agency, said in a report on the ministry’s news website,  Shana .  Crude will come from Iran’s Soroush and Norooz fields,
Bazmi said, without giving details on its content. The density
of Iranian crude from fields such as Soroush and Norooz is
higher than other grades, making the oil more difficult to
refine and the grades are only shipped to  Asia  and the
Mediterranean. Iran would be able to sell refined products in
Asian and European markets, Bazmi said.  Iran, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’
second-largest oil producer, started building the Qeshm refinery
about six months ago, Shana said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
