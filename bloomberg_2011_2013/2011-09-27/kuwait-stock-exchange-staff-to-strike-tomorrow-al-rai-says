Kuwait Stock Exchange employees are
planning a two-hour strike on Sept. 28 to protest against a
decision by Commerce Minister Amani Boresli affecting a wage
increase,  Al-Rai  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Most workers at the stock market will strike from 8:00 a.m.
to 10:00 a.m. local time, according to the Kuwait-based
newspaper. A decision to raise bourse employeesâ€™ salaries was
taken by the  Capital Markets Authority , while Boresli has
refused to hold a stock market committee meeting to decide on
the pay rise, Al-Rai said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
