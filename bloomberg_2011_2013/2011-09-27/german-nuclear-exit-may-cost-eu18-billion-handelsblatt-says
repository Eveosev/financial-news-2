EON AG, RWE AG and Vattenfall AB
are facing costs of at least 18 billion euros ($24.5 billion)
until the 17 power plants affected by  Germany ’s nuclear exit
decision are demolished and disposed of, Handelsblatt reported,
citing a study by Arthur D. Little.  “The nuclear phase-out in Germany leaves the utilities and
service providers with a difficult task,” the newspaper cited
Little consultant Michael Kruse as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
