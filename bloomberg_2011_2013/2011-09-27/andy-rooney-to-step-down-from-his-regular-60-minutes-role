Andy Rooney is leaving  CBS Corp. (CBS) ’s
“60 Minutes” show after 33 years as a featured commentator on
the most-watched prime-time news program in the U.S.  Rooney, 92, will deliver his 1,097th and final essay for
the TV magazine show on the Oct. 2 broadcast, New York-based CBS
said in a statement today. Rooney has a standing invitation to
occasionally return, Jeff Fager, CBS News chairman and “60
Minutes” executive producer, said in the statement.  “60 Minutes” will air a career retrospective, with
correspondent Morley Safer interviewing the commentator. Rooney,
a news correspondent during World War II who joined CBS in 1949
as a writer for the “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts” show, has
contributed to “60 Minutes” since the program began in 1968.  “It’s harder for him to do it every week, but he will
always have the ability to speak his mind on ‘60 Minutes’ when
the urge hits him,” Fager said.  CBS, controlled by Chairman  Sumner Redstone , gained 18
cents to $22.19 today in  New York  Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock has climbed 16 percent this year.  Rooney began appearing regularly in July 1978 with an essay
about the reporting of automobile fatalities on the Independence
Day weekend, CBS said. He became a featured contributor later
that year, alternating with James J. Kilpatrick and Shana
Alexander before getting a slot at the end of each show all to
himself in 1979. In Rooney’s first full season as commentator,
“60 Minutes” was the No. 1 program for the first time, the
network said.  Author, Veteran, Father  Rooney has written magazine articles, as well as 16 books
including “Andy Rooney: 60 Years of Wisdom and Wit” published
in 2009, CBS said.  Rooney was born Jan. 14, 1919, in  Albany , New York, CBS
said. He attended Colgate University until he was drafted into
the Army in 1941. He was one of six correspondents who flew with
the Eighth  Air Force  in February 1943 on the first U.S. bombing
raid over  Germany , according to the network.  The commentator lives in New York and has three daughters
and a son, CBS said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
