Australia ’s Energy Minister Martin Ferguson cautioned against “protectionism and isolationism”
and said close ties to fast-growing, commodity-hungry Asian
consumers give his country’s economy a “great advantage.”  “Resisting change and taking an inward-looking policy
approach will lead to longer-term harm,” Ferguson said today in
an e-mailed copy of a speech to be delivered in Sydney. “We
cannot forget that the drivers of growth in resources and energy
offer opportunities, not just challenges for other sectors.”  Australia has a “staggering” A$430 billion ($425 billion)
of mining and energy investments planned, driven by liquefied
natural gas developments, according to Ferguson. He cited
challenges such as rising wages and a higher Australian dollar.  Energy companies have approved seven LNG projects in
Australia since 2007, committing more than A$140 billion and
putting the country on a course to become the world’s second-
biggest exporter of the fuel in 2015, behind Qatar, he said.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest U.S. oil company,
announced yesterday that it decided to proceed with the A$29
billion Wheatstone LNG venture in  Western Australia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
