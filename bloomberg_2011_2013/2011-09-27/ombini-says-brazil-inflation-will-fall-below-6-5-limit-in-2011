Brazil ’s inflation rate will fall
before the end of the year to below the 6.5 percent upper limit
of the government’s target range, central bank President
Alexandre Tombini told reporters in Brasilia.  Analysts forecast consumer prices will rise 6.52 percent
this year, as inflation surpasses the upper limit of policy
makers’ target range for the first time since 2003, according to
a central bank survey of economists published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
