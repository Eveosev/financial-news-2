Murata Manufacturing Co., a
Japanese supplier of smartphone parts, fell the most in three
weeks in Osaka trading after JPMorgan Chase & Co. said  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  is cutting orders to vendors in its iPad supply chain.  Murata, which makes capacitors for smartphones and other
devices, fell 3.9 percent to 4,300 yen at the 3:10 p.m. close on
the Osaka Securities Exchange, the biggest drop in the Kyoto-
based company’s shares since Sept. 6.  The Sept. 25 JPMorgan report may have prompted some
investors to sell stakes in Murata, Hiroharu Watanabe, an
analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. in  Tokyo , said by phone
today. The report said several supply chain vendors indicated in
the past two weeks that Apple lowered fourth-quarter orders for
its iPad tablet computer by 25 percent.  The report, written by Hong Kong-based analyst Gokul Hariharan, did not list companies affected by the cut. JPMorgan
analyst  Mark Moskowitz  said yesterday the earlier report did not
represent the views of the securities firm’s U.S. team, and
wrote that Apple was “fine.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
