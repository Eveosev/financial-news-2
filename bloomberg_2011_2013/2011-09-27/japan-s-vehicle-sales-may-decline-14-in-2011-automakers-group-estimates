Demand for cars, trucks and buses
in  Japan  may drop 14 percent this year after the March 11
earthquake cut production and demand, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association said.  Sales may drop to 4.25 million vehicles, the automakers
group said today in a statement in Tokyo. For the fiscal year
ending March 31, demand may drop 3.3 percent from a year earlier
to 4.45 million, it said.  Vehicle demand began to fall after the government ended
subsidies for fuel-efficient cars last September and was further
depressed by the March temblor and tsunami, which disrupted
production due to a shortage of parts and electricity. The
automakers group forecasts sales in the September-March period
will increase 17 percent from a year earlier to 2.97 million
vehicles.  “Since sales had a sharp decline last year after the
government’s subsidies ended, we expect sales for the rest of
the year to increase,” said Toshiyuki Shiga, chairman of the
automakers group, adding that carmakers have boosted their
supplies after the earthquake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
