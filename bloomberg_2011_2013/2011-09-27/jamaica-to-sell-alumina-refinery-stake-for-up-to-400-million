Jamaica’s government expects to
sell its stake in the Clarendon alumina refinery, controlled by
 Alcoa Inc. (AA) , for as much as $400 million by the end of the year,
Finance Minister Audley Shaw said.  The sale of the 45 percent holding is part of a program to
cut costs and reduce the fiscal deficit, Shaw said in an
interview at Bloomberg headquarters in  New York  today. The
Cabinet is considering two bids, he said, without giving
details.  Jamaica’s government has lost money on the stake because of
a fixed-price agreement signed by the previous administration,
Shaw said.  “We need to get rid of it,” he said. “The decision is
imminent.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
