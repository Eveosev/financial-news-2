Pan American Silver Corp. (PAA) , the
world’s second largest primary silver producer, said it expects
to pay an additional 5 percent in tax in Peru after the
country’s Congress approved a new mining law last week.  “It looks as if the impact to us, relative to our
profitability, is fairly minor,” Steven Busby,  Pan American ’s
chief operating officer, said today in a telephone interview
from Vancouver. “We are not seeing the big increase you are
seeing at the higher profits.”  Peru’s 130-member legislature approved a new mining law
Sept. 22 to increase taxes based on companies’ profits. The
country is the world’s second-largest silver producer after
Mexico. President Ollanta Humala came to power earlier this year
as the country’s new President, vowing to raise mining royalties
and tighten state control over Peru’s natural resources.  Pan American’s Peruvian  operations  will produce about 6.7
million to 7 million ounces of silver in 2011, or about 29
percent of overall production, according to estimates on the
company’s website. The company has three mines in Peru.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  is the world’s largest primary silver
producer. Primary producers are companies which focus on silver,
rather than other metals.  Pan American rose 72 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $28.52 at
2:50 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The stock has dropped
31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
