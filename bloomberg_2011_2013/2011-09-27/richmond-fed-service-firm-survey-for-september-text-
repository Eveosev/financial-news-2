The following is the text from
the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank’s service sector activity
survey for September.  Service sector activity weakened in September, according to the
latest survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Revenues
dropped at both retail and non-retail establishments. Retail
shopper traffic fell, and big-ticket sales also ended the month
in decline. Merchants’ inventories edged up on pace with a month
ago. Retailers expected sales to remain weak for the six months
ahead, and non-retail services providers anticipated flattening
in business prospects over that period.  In service sector employment, the number of employees changed
little this month, while average wages grew modestly.  Price growth slowed slightly in September. Survey respondents
looked for the pace to accelerate during the next six months,
though by a bit less than their outlook of a month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
