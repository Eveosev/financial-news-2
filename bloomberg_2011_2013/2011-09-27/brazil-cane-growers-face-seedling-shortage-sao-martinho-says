Cane growers in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer and exporter of sugar, face a seedling shortage
that may curb next year’s crop yields, Sao Martinho SA said.  “There is a big drive to crush all the cane you have left
in the fields,” Sao Martinho Chief Executive Officer Fabio Venturelli said today in an interview from Sao Paulo. “Most
growers are not saving any cane for seedlings.”  Sao Martinho, based in Pradopolis, Brazil is the country’s
second-largest cane mill by market value.  Cane output in Brazil’s Center South, the world’s largest
growing region, will rebound next year to 540 million metric
tons, Cosan SA Industria & Comercio CEO Marcos Lutz said Aug.
29. This year the region will produce between 490 million and
500 million tons of the tropical plant.  Sugar-cane growers in Brazil will replant 911,162 hectares
of aging crops, which accounts for 11 percent of fields, the
country’s crop forecasting agency, known as Conab, said Aug. 30.
About 17 percent of crops require replanting, Conab said.  Brazil’s sugar-cane harvest runs from March to November.  Cosan shares control of the world’s largest sugar-cane
processor with Royal Dutch Shell Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
