The  euro zone  needs stronger, more
direct sanctions for nations that violate rules for the single
currency, Robert Bosch GmbH Chief Executive Officer Franz Fehrenbach wrote in an opinion article in  Handelsblatt .  An independent regulatory authority should be given the
power to step in and make national decisions, Fehrenbach, who
runs the world’s biggest car-parts manufacturer, wrote in the
German daily. The euro has “significantly led to stability and
affluence” and is needed by  Europe .  Member countries will have to give up some national
sovereignty in a slow process that should lay the groundwork for
open markets, free competition and solidarity, with the primary
goal of restoring trust, Fehrenbach wrote in Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
