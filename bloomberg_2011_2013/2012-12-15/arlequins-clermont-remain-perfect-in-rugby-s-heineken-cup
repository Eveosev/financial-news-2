Harlequins and Clermont Auvergne
maintained their perfect records in rugby’s Heineken Cup, as
Toulouse and Ulster lost for the first time.  Harlequins routed Zebre 53-5 to open up a 10-point lead in
Pool 3 after four of six matches, while Clermont beat Leinster
28-21 to move eight points ahead of the two-time defending
champion in Pool 5.  Toulouse’s 17-6 loss to Ospreys dropped it one point behind
the  Leicester Tigers , who beat Treviso 14-13, in Pool 2, while 
Ulster’s 10-9 loss to Northampton left it five points ahead of
the Saints in Pool 4. Montpellier beat the Cardiff Blues 34-21
to move into a tie for the Pool 6 lead with Touloun, which plays
the Sale Sharks tomorrow.  The six pool winners and the two best second-place teams
advance to the quarterfinals of  Europe ’s elite club competition.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
