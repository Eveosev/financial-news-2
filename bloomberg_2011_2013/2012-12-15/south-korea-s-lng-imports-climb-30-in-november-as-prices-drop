Imports of liquefied natural gas
into  South Korea , the world’s second-largest buyer of the fuel,
rose 30 percent in November as the price paid dropped.  Shipments increased to 3 million metric tons from 2.3
million a year earlier, data on the  Korea Customs Service ’s
website showed today. Imports also increased from 2.68 million
tons in October.  The cost of the purchases rose to $2.02 billion last month,
compared with $1.62 billion a year earlier, the data showed. The
average price paid per ton fell to $667.45 from $703.88 during
the same period, according to the website.  South Korea buys most of the cleaner-burning fuel under
multi year contracts from suppliers including Qatar, Indonesia
and Oman. Last month’s purchases included 60,158 tons on the
 spot market  for about $668.82 a ton from Norway, data showed.  State-run  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest LNG buyer,
said on Dec. 11 that November sales rose 31 percent to 3.5
million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
