German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that while  Europe ’s leaders have made progress on stabilizing
the euro, they must continue their fiscal integration.  “We’ve made quite a bit of progress: we have a solidarity
mechanism with the ESM and we have more budget discipline
through the fiscal pact,” Merkel said in an  online video
message  today. “But we have quite a stretch to go.”  Europe’s leaders reached a deal this week on common banking
supervision that paved the way for the European Stability
Mechanism rescue fund to recapitalize lenders to help ease the
debt crisis. Merkel called on Germans, who contribute the most
to rescues of ailing states, to recognize that their fates are
tied to other European countries.  “We’re all in it together in the euro area,” she said,
according to an e-mailed summary of her remarks from the
government. “That means European work is always domestic policy
work.”  The chancellor, who is going into 2013 with an “optimistic
but also prudent” attitude, said politicians must support
demand at home as  Germany ’s export-dependent economy weakens.  “We can’t determine the international economic situation
on our own, but we can do something, for example, to ensure
domestic demand continues sensibly,” she said.  Germany’s extension of subsidies for companies to fund
shorter employee hours and retain a skilled workforce is an
example of how government can support the economy, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
