The bodies of the victims at Sandy
Hook Elementary School in Newtown,  Connecticut , have been
positively identified and their identities will be disclosed
soon, Lieutenant Paul Vance of the state police said in a
televised briefing.  More details will be released once the medical examiner has
completed his investigation, Vance said. He said detectives,
including three separate teams, are still working at the crime
scene.  The gunman forced his way into the school, Vance said. All
the recovered weapons were found near the suspect, he said.
Vance said evidence has been found that may answer why this
crime was committed.  The lieutenant also said no other arrests associated with
the crime were made.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
