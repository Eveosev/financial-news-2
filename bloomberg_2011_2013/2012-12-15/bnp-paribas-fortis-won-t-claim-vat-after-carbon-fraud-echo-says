BNP Paribas Fortis won’t ask the
Belgian government to reimburse about 70 million euros ($92
million) of value-added tax connected to a 2009 emission-permits
fraud, L’Echo reported.  The bank bought the permits from a criminal organization
that failed to pay the value-added tax to the state, the
Brussels-based newspaper reported today.  BNP Paribas Fortis has renounced its right to seek
compensation from the government, L’Echo reported, citing bank
spokesperson Hilde Junius, who added that the decision won’t
affect the bank’s accounts.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
