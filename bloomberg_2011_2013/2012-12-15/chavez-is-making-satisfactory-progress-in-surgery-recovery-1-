Venezuela ’s President  Hugo Chavez  is
making “satisfactory” progress in recovery 72 hours after
cancer surgery in Cuba and has spoken with his family,
Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said.  “His general recovery and that of his vital signs has been
slow but progressive,” Villegas said today in a national
address broadcast on television and radio. “President Chavez
has communicated with his immediate family and through Minister
Jorge Arreaza has sent greetings to the Venezuelan people.”  Venezuelan Vice President  Nicolas Maduro , speaking
yesterday on state television, said Chavez’s condition had
improved to “favorable” from “stable” after he suffered
complications from bleeding during the six-hour operation. He
said the president will require a “delicate and prolonged
process of post-operation recovery.”  Chavez underwent his fourth surgery in 18 months for an
undisclosed form of cancer, after telling Venezuelans they
should vote for Maduro in case he’s forced to step down after 14
years in power.  To contact the reporters on this story:
