Chelsea midfielder  Frank Lampard  is
ready to accept an offer from Queen’s Park Rangers if he’s left
out of the starting lineup for tomorrow’s FIFA Club World Cup
final, the Daily Star reported.  Lampard has been offered a 2 1/2-year deal by his uncle,
QPR manager  Harry Redknapp , and would be made captain if he
joins during next month’s transfer period, the Star said.  The 34-year-old didn’t start Chelsea’s semifinal win over
Monterrey two days ago, with manager Rafael Benitez opting to
use defender David Luiz in midfield. The Blues face Corinthians
for the title tomorrow in Japan.  Lampard’s contract expires in June and he’s accepted that
he won’t get a new deal from the Blues, though he doesn’t want
to be a bit-player the rest of the season, the Star said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
