The  New York Mets  are discussing a
trade with the  Blue Jays  that would send R.A. Dickey, who won
the 2012 Cy Young Award as the National League’s top pitcher, to
Toronto, according to FoxSports.com.  In return for Dickey, 38, the Mets might receive outfielder
Anthony Gose, 22, and one of two catchers -- J.P. Arencibia, 26,
or Travis d’Arnaud, 23, the website said, quoting people in
Major League Baseball who requested anonymity.  The Mets also have been talking with Dickey about a
contract extension.  Dickey is under contract with the Mets for 2013 at a $5
million salary and the team is prepared to offer him two more
years for a total of $20 million, ESPN reported, without saying
where it got the information. Dickey is seeking a combined $26
million to $28 million for 2014 and 2015, ESPN said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
