South Korea’s won rallied for a
fourth week, leading gains among Asian currencies, after the
Federal Reserve expanded its monetary stimulus. The  yuan  fell
the most in five months after  China ’s export growth slowed.  The won had its biggest gain in eight weeks as exchange
data showed foreign investors bought $1.2 billion more local
stocks than they sold over the last five days, the largest net
inflows since September. The Fed said on Dec. 12 it will buy $45
billion a month of Treasuries starting in January, in addition
to $40 billion a month of existing mortgage-debt purchases.  “Asian currencies are strengthening as the region is
likely to receive more foreign funds after the Fed’s move,”
said Lee Jin Ill, a Seoul-based currency dealer at Hana Bank.
“What’s on the mind of traders in  Korea  is that the government
may roll out more restrictive measures to slow the pace of the
won’s gain.”  The won appreciated 0.6 percent this week to 1,074.68 per
dollar in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
 Indonesia ’s rupiah rose 0.2 percent to 9,638,  Thailand ’s baht
climbed 0.2 percent 30.63 and  Taiwan ’s dollar advanced 0.1
percent NT$29.102. Global funds plowed more than $2 billion into
stock markets in  India , Indonesia, Taiwan and Thailand this week.  China Exports  The yuan fell for a third week, losing 0.2 percent to
6.2436 versus the dollar. It has weakened 0.3 percent since
reaching a 19-year high of 6.2223 on Nov. 27. China’s export
growth slowed to 2.9 percent from 11.6 percent in November,
while industrial production and retail sales had their biggest
gains since March, data showed in the past week.  “We’re hearing a lot of implicit messages from the Chinese
authorities that they aren’t looking for rapid appreciation,”
said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency strategist at Westpac Banking
Corp. in Singapore. “The last reading for Chinese export growth
wasn’t that great.”  South Korea last month tightened restrictions on the amount
of currency forward positions banks are allowed to hold as won
gains pose a risk to exports. Vice Finance Minister Shin Je Yoon
said Dec. 11 the government is concerned about herd behavior in
won trading, and moves in “one direction” will be the most
important factor in making a decision on whether to tighten the
management of capital flows.  The Philippine peso fell 0.4 percent this week to 41.090
per dollar, trimming this year’s advance to 6.7 percent. The
central bank will implement a new measure this month to deal
with “risk-sensitive” capital inflows as interest-rate
reductions alone are no longer enough, central bank Governor
Amando Tetangco said yesterday.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas has banned overseas investors
from its special-deposit accounts and ordered lenders to provide
more funds to cover risks on non-deliverable currency forwards.
Other measures being considered to curb inflows include new
limits on currency forwards and a review of their risk premiums,
Tetangco said on Dec. 3.  Elsewhere, India’s rupee closed at 54.485 per dollar,
little changed from 54.475 on Dec. 7. Malaysia’s ringgit ended
the week at 3.0573, from 3.0578 on Dec. 7, and  Vietnam ’s dong
was also steady at 20,848.  Singapore ’s dollar fell less than 0.1
percent to S$1.2214.  To contact the reporter on this story:
