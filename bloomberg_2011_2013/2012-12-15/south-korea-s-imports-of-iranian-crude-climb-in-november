South Korea ’s imports of oil from
 Iran  increased 2.9 percent in November from October, when it
resumed shipments from the Persian Gulf nation.  Purchases last month were 814,797 metric tons, equivalent
to 5.97 million barrels, compared with 791,582 tons in October,
according to data posted on  the Korea Customs Service ’s website
today. Volumes dropped from 1.2 million tons a year earlier, the
data showed.  There were no cargoes in August or September after South
Korean refiners lost insurance coverage on ships carrying the
fuel because of international sanctions on Iran. Oil processors
globally reduced purchases from the Islamic republic this year
amid Western sanctions aimed at pressuring the nation to halt
its nuclear program, which the U.S. and  Israel  say is aimed at
developing atomic weapons.  An EU ban that started July 1 on insurance of vessels
carrying Iranian crude stopped shipments to South Korea as 95
percent of the world’s tankers are covered in the bloc.  SK
Innovation Co. (096770)  and Hyundai Oilbank Co. resumed imports after
Iran offered its own vessels.  South Korea’s imports from Iran fell 41 percent to 6.99
million tons, or 5.9 percent of the total, during the first 11
months of this year compared with the same period last year,
according to the customs data.  Iran was the Asian nation’s sixth-largest crude supplier
last year when it accounted for 9.4 percent of purchases, Korean
government data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
