Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti
would be better off serving the country in a secondary role,
rather than running in elections for another term, said Pier Luigi Bersani, head of  Italy ’s Democratic Party.  “We aren’t worried at all, we are are calm,” he said
today at a conference in  Rome  about whether Monti will decide to
run in elections that will be probably held in February. “We
just hope that there are decisions taken and that we end this
discussion.”  The center-left Democratic Party, which is one the parties
backing Monti’s coalition government, led in the most recent
opinion poll with the support of 30 percent of likely voters,
according to the survey by ISPO Ricerche released on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
