Greek coastguards recovered the
bodies of at least 18 migrants who drowned off the island of
Lesvos after their boat sank in heavy seas.  The dead were part of a group of 28 men, women and children
who had left  Turkey  yesterday for the Greek island of Mytilene,
the coastguard said in a statement on its website today, citing
an unidentified survivor. Their dinghy sank in high waves within
an hour of leaving the Turkish coast, the coastguard said. The
nationalities of the group couldn’t immediately be determined.  The coastguard’s search-and-rescue operation continues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
