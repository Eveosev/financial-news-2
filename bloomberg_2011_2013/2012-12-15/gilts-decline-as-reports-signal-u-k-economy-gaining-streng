U.K. government bonds fell this
week, with 10-year yields rising the most since October, as data
signaled the economic recovery is gaining strength, weakening
the case for more bond-buying by the Bank of England.  Ten-year gilts dropped for a sixth straight day yesterday,
the longest stretch of declines since October 2011. Standard &
Poor’s lowered the U.K.’s credit-rating outlook to negative from
stable on Dec. 13, citing weak economic growth and a worsening
debt profile. An industry group yesterday predicted house prices
will increase next year and a Bank of England official said the
economy will improve in 2013.  “It’s more to do with the economy” rather than the rating
outlook, said Annalisa Piazza, a strategist at Newedge Group in
 London , referring to the rise in yields. “The rating agencies
are obviously concerned that there will be a cyclical impact on
the fiscal consolidation given the reduced receipts because of
the lower activity. That’s why they need to be alert.”  The 10-year gilt yield climbed 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, this week to 1.86 percent at 5 p.m. in London
yesterday. That’s the biggest increase since the period ended
Oct. 19. The 1.75 percent bond due in September 2022 declined
1.06, or 10.60 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,614) face amount, to
99.005.  Economic Data  U.K. home values will increase 2 percent in 2013 after a 1
percent gain this year, the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors said in a report yesterday. Data according to the
Office for National Statistics this week showed jobless claims
unexpectedly declined in November, while the Confederation of
British Industry said its gauge of  manufacturing orders  improved
in December.  Bank of England Markets Director Paul Fisher told Reuters
two days ago that the U.K. economy will pick up slowly during
next year and the deflation risk has subsided, reducing the need
to “do asset purchases in large scale.”  Policy makers are due on Dec. 19 to release the minutes of
their Dec. 6 meeting, when they maintained the central bank’s
asset-purchase  target  at 375 billion pounds and the key interest
rate at a  record low  of 0.5 percent.  The pound strengthened for a second straight week against
the dollar, rising 0.7 percent to $1.6145. It depreciated 1
percent to 81.44 pence per euro.  The pound has gained 1.2 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 1.5 percent and
the dollar dropped 3 percent.  U.K. gilts handed investors a loss of 0.9 percent this
month through Dec. 13, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German bunds earned 0.3 percent, while Treasuries
declined 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
