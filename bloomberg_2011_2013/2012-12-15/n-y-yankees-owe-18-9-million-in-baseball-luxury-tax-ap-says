The  New York Yankees  owe $18.9
million in Major League Baseball’s luxury tax after finishing
the 2012 season with a MLB-high $222.5 million payroll, the
Associated Press reported.  It is the 10th consecutive year the Yankees will pay the
luxury tax, AP said, with a cumulative bill of $224.2 million
over that decade.  Yankees spokesman Jason Zillo didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment on the report.  The luxury tax is used by MLB as part of an effort to
ensure competitive balance among teams by preventing high-salary
clubs from signing most of the top players.  The 2012 figures were sent by MLB to teams two days ago, AP
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
