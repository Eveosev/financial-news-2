Hungary  may finance itself with
local-currency debt in 2013 and issue no foreign-currency bonds
for a second year, Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said in a
radio interview.  Hungary, which last issued so-called Eurobonds in May 2011,
has the biggest debt burden in the east of the European Union.
Public debt will fall to 73 percent of gross domestic product by
the end of 2013 from a projected 77 percent at the end of this
year, Matolcsy said in an interview with state-run  MR1-Kossuth
radio  today.  Hungary scrapped plans to issue foreign-currency bonds this
year because the forint and the country’s bonds were among the
best performers in the EU so the government preferred to raise
more funds domestically, Matolcsy said.  “I am not certain that we need to issue foreign-currency
denominated bonds on the international markets next year,”
Matolcsy told MR1-Kossuth. “We can finance ourselves on the
forint market.”  Hungary is still looking for a “safety net” from the
 International Monetary Fund  as protection against a
deterioration in the euro-area economy, Matolcsy said. At the
same time, Hungary wants to keep room for its “creative”
economic policies, so the country shouldn’t join the common
currency bloc until its economy becomes more developed, Matolcsy
added.  Hungary’s “growth and investment turnaround” in 2013
after this year’s recession will mean that any modifications of
next year’s budget will be on the positive side, Matolcsy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
