China National Petroleum Corp., the
countryâ€™s largest energy company, made a second payment toward a
$900 million signing bonus it must make to develop the Junin 4
oil block in  Venezuela ,  Petroleos de Venezuela SA  said today.  It paid $180 million, PDVSA said. The bonus will be paid in
several installments and is in addition to capital needed to
produce and refine crude at the Orinoco Belt field.  State-run PDVSA and CNPC signed an accord in April 2010 to
invest $16.3 billion in a joint venture that will produce
400,000 barrels a day in 2016. CNPC will be a minority partner.  Also today, CNPC and PDVSA agreed to sign a contract with
China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corp. and Technip SA to
build an upgrader unit in the Orinoco Belt project that can
process 200,000 barrels a day, PDVSA said.  PDVSA also said that CNPC is interested in working on the
Junin 10 block in the Orinoco Belt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
