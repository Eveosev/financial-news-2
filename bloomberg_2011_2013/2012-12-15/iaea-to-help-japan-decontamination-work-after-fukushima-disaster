The  International Atomic Energy
Agency  agreed to help Japan with decontamination and radioactive
waste management after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.  The IAEA and the Fukushima prefecture government signed the
agreement in Koriyama city, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) west
of  Tokyo  Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant.
The IAEA will send teams to help decontaminate areas around the
plant as well as help radiation monitoring and health-care
research projects.  The March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami caused meltdowns
and release of radiation into the air and sea from the Fukushima
plant, forcing about 160,000 people to evacuate. Some areas
around the plant, northwest of Tokyo, may be uninhabitable for
at least two decades because of radioactive contamination, the
government estimated last year.  The signing ceremony between the IAEA and Fukushima
prefecture was part of a three-day conference through Dec. 17 to
discuss nuclear safety. Officials from more than 50 countries
and organizations are expected to attend the conference,
according to Japan’s Ministry of  Foreign Affairs .  To contact the reporters on this story:
