Manchester City defeated Newcastle
3-1 to rebound from its first loss of the season in English
soccer’s Premier League.  Sergio Aguero , Javi Garcia and Yaya Toure scored in the
away win as defending champion City pulled within three points
of Manchester United at the top of the standings. United, which
ended City’s 15-match unbeaten run to open the season with a 3-2
win last weekend, hosts Sunderland later today.  Demba Ba scored for Newcastle, which lost for the sixth
time in seven league matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
