Steven Nyman of the U.S. won the
men’s World Cup downhill in  Italy , as the women’s super-G ski
race in  France  was canceled because of heavy snowfall.  Nyman, 30, had a time of 1 minute, 28.82 seconds after the
start of today’s race in Val Gardena was delayed by fog and
snow. It was his second career victory, the first coming on the
same Saslong course in 2006, and his first top-three World Cup
finish in five years.  “Weather was a huge factor,” Nyman, who moved to fifth in
the downhill standings, 125 points behind leader Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway, said on the U.S. Ski Team’s website. “This
is the best gift I could have.”  Rok Perko of Slovenia was 0.19 seconds behind Nyman in
second place, with  Canada ’s Erik Guay finishing third, 0.26
seconds back.  Svindal, who also tops the overall World Cup standings,
finished fifth today. He leads American Ted Ligety by 177 points
for the overall title and is 86 points ahead of countryman
Kjetil Jansrud, who was fourth today, in the downhill standings.  The men’s tour moves to Alta Badia in Italy tomorrow for a
giant slalom race.  The women’s race in Val d’Isere, scheduled to start at 9:45
a.m. local time, was called off following an early-morning
inspection of the course.  The women will race a giant slalom tomorrow in Courchevel,
France. Switzerland’s Lara Gut won yesterday’s downhill in Val
d’Isere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
