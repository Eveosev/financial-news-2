Pilots at  United Continental
Holdings Inc. (UAL)  voted in favor of a joint contract that will allow
them to mesh ranks more than two years after their carriers
merged to create the world’s largest airline.  Sixty-seven percent of those participating in the vote
approved of the agreement, the United and Continental chapters
of the Air Line Pilots Association said in a statement. About 98
percent of the 10,193 eligible pilots voted, the company and the
union said.  The pact is in effect through December 2016.  Union leaders last month agreed to a tentative contract
with management that includes pay raises and lump-sum payments
in exchange for productivity gains such as allowing the airline
to have regional partners fly more 76-seat jets.  The Chicago-based company recorded an expense of $454
million in the third quarter for lump-sum payouts pilots will
receive once the accord is ratified and when they integrate
seniority lists, which determine the size of planes they fly and
schedule preferences. The airline has 12,000 pilots.  United Airlines parent UAL Corp. merged with Continental
Airlines Inc. in 2010 in an all-stock deal, surpassing Delta Air
Lines Inc. as the world’s biggest carrier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
