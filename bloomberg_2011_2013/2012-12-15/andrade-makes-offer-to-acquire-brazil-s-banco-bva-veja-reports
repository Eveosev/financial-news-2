Brazilian businessman Carlos Alberto
de Oliveira Andrade offered this week to buy Banco BVA SA, Veja
magazine reported in its Radar column, without saying how it got
the information.  Andrade, who has 700 million reais ($336 million) invested
in BVA, is the only person to make an offer so far, the Sao
Paulo-based magazine said. The lender was taken over by the
central bank in October after regulators found deteriorating
finances and violations of industry standards, issues on which
the bank has declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
