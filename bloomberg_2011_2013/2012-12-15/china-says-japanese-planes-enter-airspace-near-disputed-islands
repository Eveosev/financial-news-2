China  protested what it says were
 Japan  military planes entering its airspace near islands claimed
by both countries.  The Foreign Ministry made the protest to Japan yesterday,
spokesman Hong Lie said, according to the ministry’s website.  “The Foreign Ministry has urged the Japanese side to take
China’s solemn position seriously and stop all acts that
infringe upon or harm China’s territorial sovereignty,” Hong
said, according to the ministry.  Japan said yesterday its Coast Guard spotted a Chinese
marine surveillance propeller plan near the disputed islands
known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan. While Japan said
it dispatched eight F-15 fighter jets, the Chinese plane had
already left the area.  Japan will react calmly to the situation, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Osamu Fujimura told reporters yesterday in Tokyo.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors:  Mike Anderson , Paul Tighe  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
