Fairfax Media Ltd. (FXJ) ,  Australia ’s
second-largest newspaper company, is selling a stake in  Trade Me
Ltd. (TME)  worth A$616 million ($651 million), the Australian
Financial Review newspaper reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  The 202 million shares of Trade Me, the  New Zealand  online
auction site, are being sold through UBS AG at about A$3.05
each, the newspaper said. Trade Me shares in Australia closed at
A$3.22 on Dec. 14, the most recent closing price, and at NZ$4.05
($3.43) in New Zealand that same day.  Brad Hatch, Sydney-based spokesman for Fairfax, declined to
comment today in an e-mail when asked about the stake sale.  Fairfax has seen its  share price  fall 88 percent in the
past five years as newspaper readers switched to the Internet
and falling consumer spending eroded advertising sales.  The company’s shares slumped 29 percent this year after it
posted a record annual A$2.73 billion loss and said in June it
will cut 1,900 workers, close printing sites and introduce
Internet subscriptions as it seeks to halt sliding revenue.  Fairfax earlier this year sold 59.4 million shares in Trade
Me at the equivalent of NZ$3.46 each, reducing its stake to 51
percent from 66 percent, Wellington-based Trade Me said in a
statement June 18.  Gina Rinehart , Asia’s richest woman, is Fairfax’s biggest
shareholder, owning a 15 percent stake, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. She failed in June to get a seat on the
board for herself after disagreeing on conditions including
signing Fairfax’s Charter of Editorial Independence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
