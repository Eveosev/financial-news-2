More than 180,000 students at public
elementary schools in Toronto may be out of school Dec. 18 as
teachers prepare to hold a one-day strike to protest legislation
that freezes their wages.  Full-time and occasional, or substitute, teachers will
participate in the strike in  Canada ’s most populous city, the
Elementary Teachers’ Federation of Ontario said today in a news
statement.  Union locals representing elementary teachers in seven
other regions of Ontario said in separate statements they will
also walk out Dec. 18.  Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty’s government passed a  law 
in September that freezes the wages of public school teachers,
who have been trying to negotiate new labor agreements with the
province, through the end of March 2014.  In October, Finance Minister Dwight Duncan said the
province will  post  a C$14.4 billion ($14.6 billion) deficit in
the current fiscal year.  “We have been forced into this action by an education
minister who has willfully stripped educators of their legal
right to collectively bargain,” Martin Long, president of the
Elementary Teachers of Toronto, said in a statement today.  Toronto has 451 elementary schools with 184,000  students ,
according to the Toronto District School Board, the largest in
the country.  School board representatives didn’t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment outside of normal business hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
