Moscow police detained opposition
leaders Alexey Navalny, Sergey Udaltsov, Ksenia Sobchak and Ilya
Yashin for organizing an illegal protest in the Russian capital
against President  Vladimir Putin .  They have been held as “direct organizers and
instigators” of the protest, according to  statements  on the
Moscow police website. About 1,000 people gathered in Lubyanka
Square, according to Bloomberg estimates. The four leaders were
later released without being charged, RIA reported, citing their
lawyer.  The event marks a year since the first mass protests
against the 2011 election of then Prime Minister Putin’s ruling
party to the lower chamber, which was marred by allegations of
fraud.  The police  estimated  the number of demonstrators at about
700, with more than 300 of those being journalists and bloggers.
Special forces police later dispersed the crowd and arrested 40
people after “repeated warnings” to leave the square,
according to a  statement .  To contact the reporters on this story:
