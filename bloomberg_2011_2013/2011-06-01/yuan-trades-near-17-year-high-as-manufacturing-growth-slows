The yuan rose to its strongest level
in 17 years on speculation  China  will allow appreciation to
tackle inflation even after manufacturing data added to signs
 Asia ’s largest economy is cooling.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 52 in May, the lowest
in nine months, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
said in an e-mailed statement today. The number was higher than
the median forecast of 51.6 in a Bloomberg News survey. Nomura
Holdings Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.
cut economic growth forecasts for China last month, reflecting
the impact of four interest-rate rises and eight increases in
lenders’ reserve-requirement ratios since September.  “The pace of renminbi rises may slow as the economy cools
and inflation comes off the boil, but I think there will be that
pressure there to appreciate through the rest of this year,”
said Jonathan Cavenagh, a foreign-exchange strategist in
Singapore at Westpac Banking Corp. “Today’s Chinese PMI data
came a bit stronger than expected but still quite soft,”  The yuan increased 0.02 percent to 6.4780 per dollar as of
6:16 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency reached 6.4777 earlier, the strongest
level since the country unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993. The yuan has advanced 1.7 percent this
year.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.02 percent
to 6.3590 per dollar, a 1.9 percent premium to the onshore spot
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In  Hong Kong ’s
offshore market, the currency strengthened 0.06 percent to
6.4765.  The People’s Bank of China raised the currency’s reference
rate 0.01 percent to 6.4837 per dollar today, the strongest
level since July 2005. The yuan isn’t allowed to move more than
0.5 percent on either side of the central bank’s daily fixing.  Consumer prices rose 5.3 percent in April from a year
earlier, slightly below the 5.4 percent increase in March that
was the biggest since July 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
