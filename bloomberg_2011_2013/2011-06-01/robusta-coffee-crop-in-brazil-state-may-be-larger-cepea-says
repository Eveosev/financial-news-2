The robusta coffee crop in Espirito
Santo,  Brazil ’s main robusta-producing state, may be as much as
2 million bags larger than the government’s estimate of 8.1
million bags, according to Cepea, a University of Sao Paulo
research group.  Cepea analyst Margarete Boteon cited the company’s survey
of local agents for the estimate, and didn’t give a reason for
the difference. Robusta coffee prices in Brazil have climbed as
demand in the domestic and international markets is higher than
supply, Boteon said. Demand for robusta beans has increased
partly because of higher prices for arabica beans, she said.  Arabica coffee futures have risen 93 percent in New York
over the past year, while robusta beans have climbed 92 percent
in  London . Brazil is the second-largest grower of robusta beans,
after Vietnam. Arabica beans are grown mostly in  Latin America 
and robustas are mostly in Asia and Africa, as well as Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
