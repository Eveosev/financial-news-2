Northumbrian Water Group Plc (NWG) , which
supplies about 4.4 million customers in the U.K., posted a 6.3
percent increase in pretax profit following a price review by
regulator Ofwat.  Profit before tax climbed to 181 million pounds ($297
million) from 170.2 million pounds a year earlier, the Durham-
based company said in a statement today. Sales rose 4.7 percent
to 738.1 million pounds.  Prices charged by Northumbrian’s water unit increased in
line with the Ofwat review allowance of 5 percent plus the
November 2009 retail price index of 0.3 percent, the company
said. In November, Ofwat capped price increases for the industry
for the five-year period. Income from water and waste contracts
increased by 4.4 percent, Northumbrian said.  “This is the first year of a five-year regulatory cycle,”
Chief Executive Officer Heidi Mottram said in an interview. “We
plan to spend pretty evenly over the next five years; around 250
million pounds each year.”  Projects include increasing the capacity of the Abberton
reservoir in Essex and construction of a second anaerobic
digestion plant at Howdon, on Tyneside, the executive said. The
plant will be finished by the end of 2012 and together with an
existing plant at Bran Sands on Teesside will produce about
8,000 megawatt-hours of electricity, she said.  Bid Speculation  Northumbrian shares have risen 21 percent since the end of
January on speculation that the  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan ,
which owns a 27 percent stake in the water utility, may increase
its holding, Investec analyst Angelos Anastasiou said in a note
to investors.  “At present levels, we still regard a bid as a
possibility, but not a probability,” he said. Anastasiou has a
“hold” rating on the stock.  Northumbrian will pay a full-year dividend of 14.29 pence a
share. Net income jumped 46 percent to 178.3 million pounds,
boosted by a deferred tax credit of 30.5 million pounds. This
reflects a decrease in the company’s deferred tax liability of
46.3 million pounds after the government trimmed corporate taxes
to 26 percent from 28 percent, Northumbrian said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
