Greece ’s local and foreign currency
bond ratings were cut to Caa1 from B1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, which cited a growing risk that the country will
default on its debt.  Moody’s said the outlook on Greek debt is negative, meaning
that the rating could be reduced further. The rating is seven
steps below investment grade.  “Greece is increasingly likely to fail to stabilize its
debt ratios within the timeframe set by previously announced
fiscal consolidation plans,” Moody’s said today in a statement.
The country is also unlikely to meet its previously announced
budget targets for 2011, it said.  European officials readying Greece’s second bailout in two
years are preparing to ask investors to reinvest in new debt
when existing bonds mature, overcoming central bankers’
objections to any restructuring. European leaders are trying to
prevent the euro area’s first sovereign default after last
year’s 110 billion-euro ($158 billion) rescue failed to prevent
an investor exodus from Greece.  Greece was due to return to financial markets and sell
about 30 billion euros of bonds next year. With its 10-year
bonds yielding 16.1 percent, more than twice that at the time of
the bailout, the European Union has indicated that Greece will
need more aid to plug its financing gap.  The move by Moody’s follows a two-grade cut to B, five
levels below investment grade, by  Standard & Poor’s  on May 9,
which said further reductions are possible as the risk of
default rises. The same day, Moody’s placed Greece’s B1 ratings
on review for a possible downgrade.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
