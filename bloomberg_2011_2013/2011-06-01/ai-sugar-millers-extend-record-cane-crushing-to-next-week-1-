Sugar mills in  Thailand , the world’s
second-largest exporter, will extend cane crushing into next
week, increasing supplies to the highest ever, according to the
country’s Office of the Cane & Sugar Board.  “Only a few millers will extend crushing to next week” to
process about 40,000 tons of cane a day, Prasert Tapaneeyangkul,
secretary-general of the board said today.  Cane harvests climbed to a record of 95.1 million tons in
the crop year from Nov. 28 to May 31, according to data on the
Cane & Sugar Board  website . During the period, Thailand produced
9.63 million tons of sugar. Of the total, 3.9 million tons were
white sugar and the remaining 5.6 million tons were raw variety,
it said.  Thailand may accelerate production of white sugar after the
premium for the refined sugar variety over the raw sweetener
climbed to near a one-year high, Swiss Sugar Brokers said today.  The premium rose to $162.30 a metric ton by 9:47 a.m. in
 London , the highest since June 18, according to data on
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
