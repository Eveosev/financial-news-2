Australia ’s dollar erased gains
against the U.S. currency as falling Asian stocks damped demand
for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called Aussie strengthened earlier after the data
showed retail sales rose 1.1 percent in April from the previous
month, beating the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. The New Zealand dollar dropped against 15 of its 16
most-traded peers after Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the
world’s largest dairy exporter, said whole milk powder prices
fell to the lowest in more than four months.  “A pessimistic outlook for the global economy is reflected
in the drop in stocks,” said  Daisaku Ueno , president of
Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd. in Tokyo, a unit of  Japan ’s
largest online currency broker. “That’s weighing on the Aussie
while there is no domestic reason to sell it.”  Australia’s dollar traded at to $1.0615 as of 3:48 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0614 yesterday in  New York , after rising to as
high as $1.0660. The currency bought 85.99 yen from 85.93 yen.
New Zealand’s dollar dropped to 81.20 U.S. cents from 81.46. It
fetched 65.78 yen from 65.95 yen.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of regional shares lost 1.9
percent after data showed manufacturing growth from the U.S. to
 China  and the euro region slowed last month and American
employers hired fewer workers than forecast.  Auckland-based Fonterra said near-term contracts for whole
milk powder prices declined 5.7 percent to $3,760 a metric ton
at an auction, the lowest since Jan. 18.  Trade Surplus  Australia had a trade surplus of A$1.6 billion ($1.7
billion) in April, compared with a revised A$1.69 billion
surplus in March, a Bureau of Statistics report showed today.  “Commodity/risk currencies suffered and the Australian
dollar struggled to take advantage of better than expected”
retail sales data,  Sue Trinh , a senior currency strategist at
Royal Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong , wrote in a note to clients
today. “The trade balance was a little disappointing although
we expect this to improve as mining comes back on line through
the second quarter. We continue to look for an August hike
although today’s data lend some weight to July.”  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will meet on June 7. Swap
traders are betting the central bank will boost its benchmark
rate by 24 basis points over the next 12 months, according to a
Credit Suisse AG index.  The central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged at
4.75 percent for the past five meetings after boosting borrowing
costs seven times from October 2009 to November 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
