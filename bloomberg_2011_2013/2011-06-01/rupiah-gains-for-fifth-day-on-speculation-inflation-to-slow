Indonesia ’s rupiah strengthened for a
fifth day as consumer-price gains eased for a fourth month.
Benchmark bonds advanced.  The currency traded near a three-week high as overseas
funds pumped money into Indonesia’s government debt. Inflation
accelerated 5.98 percent in May from a year earlier, compared
with 6.16 percent in April, the Central Bureau of Statistics
said in Jakarta today.  “Inflation came in relatively soft and that has boosted
sentiment in the bond market,” said  Gundy Cahyadi , an economist
at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “There has been
some renewed optimism out of the euro zone over a possible bail-
out plan for Greece, helping to lift  market sentiment  across the
board.”  The rupiah advanced 0.1 percent to 8,538 per dollar as of
4:22 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency touched 8,531 yesterday, the strongest level since
May 12.  Global funds increased their holdings of the nation’s bonds
by 1.2 percent to 224.06 trillion rupiah ($26 billion) last
month through May 30, official  data  show. Offshore investors
bought $29 million more Indonesian shares than they sold in the
first two days of this week, according to exchange data.  European Union leaders will decide on more aid for  Greece 
by the end of June and have ruled out a “total restructuring”
of the country’s debt, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said on May 30.  Indonesia’s 10-year government bonds rose. The yield on the
8.25 percent note due July 2021 slipped three basis points of
0.03 percentage points today, according to closing prices from
the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
