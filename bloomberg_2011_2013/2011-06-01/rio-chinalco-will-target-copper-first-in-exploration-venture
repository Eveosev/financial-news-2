Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-
largest mining company, and its biggest shareholder, Aluminum
Corp. of  China , said their exploration joint venture will
firstly seek large copper deposits.  Coal and potash are among secondary targets, London-based
Rio said today in a statement. Chinalco, as the state-owned
Chinese aluminum producer is known, and Rio formally signed the
joint venture agreement in Beijing today after it was announced
in December.  Rio Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese said last year he
wants to help China explore for domestic deposits. The deal was
part of efforts to improve relations after Rio rejected
Chinalco’s proposed $19.5 billion investment in June 2009.  “Security of supply of key minerals is an issue of the
highest importance for China,” Albanese said in Beijing. “Rio
Tinto wishes to be a strategic partner to China in the supply,
development and also the discovery of those resources.”  Chinalco will control 51 percent of the venture with Rio
holding the balance. The venture is expected to be based in
Beijing.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
