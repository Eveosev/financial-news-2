Russia , holder of the world’s biggest
gas reserves and the largest exporter to Europe, said the Gas
Exporting Countries Forum won’t emulate OPEC by imposing
production quotas on members.  The forum “is not OPEC,” Anatoly Yonovsky, Russia’s
deputy oil minister, told reporters in Cairo before the 11-
member group meets tomorrow. “I think it won’t ever be.”  Gas and oil markets are “quite different” and no members
have attempted to impose production quotas in the same manner as
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, he said.  The Gas Forum, which brings together some of the world’s
biggest exporters in the same way OPEC groups oil producers,
can’t control global production or prices for the next five or
10 years because most supply contracts are long-term, Secretary-
General Leonid Bokhanovsky said in December.  The forum’s members are  Algeria , Bolivia, Egypt,  Equatorial
Guinea , Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Trinidad & Tobago
and Venezuela. Kazakhstan, the Netherlands and Norway have
observer status. Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei may join as
members, and the group may talk with Australia, Turkmenistan and
Canada about becoming observers, Bokhanovsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
