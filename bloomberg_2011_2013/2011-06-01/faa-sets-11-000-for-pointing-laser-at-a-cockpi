The U.S.  Federal Aviation
Administration  plans to fine people who shine lasers into
airplane cockpits as much as $11,000.  “This is not taking a laser pointer and playing with your
cat,” Federal Aviation Administrator  Randy Babbitt   said today
at Washington Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia.
“This is serious.”  Pilots can be temporarily blinded, especially at lower
altitudes when taking off or landing, when people point lasers
at planes, Babbitt said at the news conference at the airport.  The FAA has logged about 1,100 reports of lasers being
shined at pilots so far this year, and 2,836 for all of last
year. That’s an increase from about 300 in 2005, the first year
the agency collected the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
