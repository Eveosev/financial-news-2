French Industry Minister Eric Besson
said the country’s foreign investment promotion agency will help
find a buyer for  LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB) ’s Berre refinery
in southern  France .  The French Agency for International Investment, which
specializes in finding buyers for industrial sites, will
research potential acquirers, Besson said today in a statement.  A “national action plan” for refining will examine
security of supply in France after LyondellBasell Industries’
announcement yesterday that Berre is for sale, Besson said. The
refinery can process 105,000 barrels of oil a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The plan will also look at whether French refining is
competitive or needs further restructuring, according to a
statement from the ministry.  Petroplus Holdings AG, Europe’s largest independent
refiner, has announced the permanent halt of oil-processing at
its Reichstett facility in France after failing to find a buyer
while  Total SA (FP)  halted oil-processing at its refinery at Dunkirk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
