(Corrects to say Ford sales fell in May.)  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s May U.S. light-
vehicle sales fell 2.6 percent.  The average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a decrease of 0.5 percent.  The figures account for Ford’s ownership of the Volvo car
brand in the year-ago period. Ford has since sold Volvo. Ford
excludes Volvo from its auto sales news release. Ford has also
discontinued its Mercury brand. Year-ago Mercury results are
included in Ford’s statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
