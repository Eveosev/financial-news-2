China ’s light vehicle sales will grow
between 12 to 15 percent annually through 2016, boosted by
rising wealth, consulting company AlixPartners said after
surveying industry executives.  The number of households with annual income of more than
60,000 yuan ($9,262) is expected to double in the next five
years, spurring demand for cars, said Managing Director Ivo Naumann, head of AlixPartners in China, whose firm polled 40
senior executives.  Auto sales in China fell for the first time in 27 months in
April, declining 0.25 percent from a year earlier to 1.55
million vehicles, according to data collected by the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers.  That drop came as the government phased out subsidies and
raised fuel prices, and cities imposed controls to curb traffic
and pollution. Industrywide deliveries may fall 10 percent this
year in the world’s largest vehicle market, the government-
linked China Automotive Technology & Research Center said May 26.  “The market witnessed a period of slowdown in the first
few months of the year as the government phased out
incentives,” Naumann said at a briefing today in  Shanghai .
“And yet the executives we surveyed have a very positive view
on its long-term growth.”  China carmakers will boost their market share to 34 percent
from about 28 percent this year, according to the AlixPartners
survey. Japanese auto brands likely will lose market share as a
result, it said.  Electric vehicles and hybrids will account for 13 percent
of the total in China by 2016 as the government encourages the
use of such vehicles, AlixPartners said.  --Liza Lin. Editors: Terje Langeland, Nicholas Wadhams  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
