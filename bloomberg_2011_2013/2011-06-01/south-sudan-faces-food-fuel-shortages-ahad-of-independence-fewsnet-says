Southern Sudan  faces food and fuel
shortages as uncertainty over its scheduled independence in July
has cut the volume of food and non-food supplies by as much as
40 percent, the Famine Early Warning Network said.  Fuel supplies have also been slashed, while the price of
refined gasoline rose by as much as 70 percent in parts of
Southern Sudan during May, Fewsnet, which is backed by the U.S.
Agency for International Development, said yesterday on its
website.   Trade flows between the north and south have been hindered
by insecurity caused by militia rebellions, especially in Unity
state, according to Fewsnet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
