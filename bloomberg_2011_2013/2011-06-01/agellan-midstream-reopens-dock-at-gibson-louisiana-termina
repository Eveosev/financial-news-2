Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  said
it has reopened one of two docks at its terminal in Gibson,
 Louisiana , citing lower water levels on the Atchafalaya River.  Water levels had fallen enough for Magellan to begin
receiving barges at the dock yesterday, Bruce Heine, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.  Gibson, located in southeast Louisiana along the
Atchafalaya River, is capable of storing about 50,000 barrels of
oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
