Singapore ’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said the city-state is still mulling over the use of
nuclear energy. He spoke to reporters in Singapore today.  “It’s a significant issue for Singapore for the longer
term. We have made no decision on nuclear energy. We need to
understand it because this is a subject that’s not going to go
away. And even if we don’t do nuclear energy, our neighbors will
do nuclear energy. We need to understand the implications for
us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
