Rockhopper Exploration Plc , the only
oil explorer to make a potentially commercial discovery in the
Falkland Islands, surged 10 percent after reporting a
“significant” oil and gas discovery at the Sea Lion field.  Rockhopper advanced 24 pence to 255 pence in London, the
biggest gain since March 21.  The 14/10-5 appraisal well drilled through 93.5 meters (306
feet) of “net pay in good quality reservoir,” the company said
today in a statement. The well was drilled 600 meters north of
the original 14/10-2 discovery well.  “The well was designed to appraise the Sea Lion main fan
reservoir and investigate hydrocarbon column and reservoir
distribution,” the company said. “The well has been highly
successful, proving a very thick, high quality reservoir package
and a substantial oil column.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
