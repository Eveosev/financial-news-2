The  Asian Development Bank , a Manila-
based lender, plans to sell $1 billion of three-year bonds,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  Bank of America Corp., Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Ltd.
and Deutsche Bank AG will help manage the sale of notes, which
may be sold as soon as today, said the person, asking not to be
identified as details are private. The bonds are being offered
to investors to yield about 7 basis points less than the mid-
swap rate, the person said.  The bank last sold three-year debt on May 13, with a sale
of 1.25 billion of Norwegian kroner bonds priced with a coupon
of 3.375 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ADB has $53.8 billion of bonds outstanding due to mature by
