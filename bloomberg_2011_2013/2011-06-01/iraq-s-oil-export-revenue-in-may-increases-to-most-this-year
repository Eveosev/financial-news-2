Iraq , holder of the world’s fifth-
largest oil reserves, exported 2.23 million barrels of oil a day
in May, with record revenue this year of $7.4 billion, said
Falah al-Amri, chairman of the State Oil Marketing Organization.  Iraq sold crude at an average price of $108 a barrel last
month, he said today in a telephone interview from  Baghdad .  Dependent on oil for most government revenue, Iraq is
struggling to raise exports and is seeking foreign investors to
boost output after decades of conflict and sanctions destroyed
its infrastructure. The crude industry has also suffered in
recent years from insufficient spending and insurgent attacks.  The port of Basra in the country’s south exported 1.725
million barrels of crude a day last month while the oil hub of
Kirkuk in the north shipped 490,000 barrels a day, al-Amri said.
Another 10,000 barrels a day were shipped to Jordan by trucks,
he said.  Iraq has signed 15 gas and oil licenses since the 2003
U.S.-led invasion that ousted the regime of former President
 Saddam Hussein . It expects current oil output to rise to more
than 3 million barrels a day by the end of this year, compared
with 2.4 million barrels a day in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
