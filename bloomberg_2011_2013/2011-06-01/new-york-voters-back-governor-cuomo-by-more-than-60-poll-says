New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo ’s
policies receive support from 61 percent of the state’s voters,
including both Democrats and Republicans, a Quinnipiac
University poll reported.  Cuomo, 53, a Democrat elected in 2010, enjoys a 61 percent
to 18 percent job approval rating, and voters said they like his
personality by 61 percent to 13 percent. Voters agreed with most
of his policies by 61 percent to 23 percent, including 61
percent of Republicans, the poll said.  “Talk about a clean sweep! There’s not a single negative
number,” said  Maurice Carroll , director of the  Quinnipiac
University Polling Institute  in Hamden,  Connecticut . Voters
approved of Cuomo’s handling of “that bugaboo that haunts most
elected officials, the budget,” by 57 percent to 30 percent, he
said.  In March, Cuomo reduced total outlays 2 percent in his
$132.5 billion budget for the year that started April 1 to help
close a $10 billion deficit. It marked the first time since 2006
that lawmakers passed a budget before the start of the fiscal
year.  The survey from May 24-30 used telephone interviews with
1,257 registered voters to produce a margin of error of 2.8
percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
