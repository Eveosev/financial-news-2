In the  India  of the eighties and nineties in which I grew up, the word "abroad" carried a fantastic charge, uttered with pride by those in the middle class who had been outside the country (even if that meant a week's vacation in  Thailand , or employment in a Gulf state) and with envy by those for whom leaving the country on any pretext was yet a dream. In the two decades after the liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991, that has changed. Plane-loads of Indian tourists descend on European and Asian capitals; almost every middle-class Indian family has either a child or a relative in America; and  Australia  is a new top destination for higher education and tourism. But if there is one part of the world that still possesses only a modest hold on the Indian public imagination, it is Africa. Although the continent is home to a substantial Indian diaspora, that population is concentrated in the east and the south, particularly in South Africa (where, at the turn of the 19th century,  Mahatma Gandhi  refined his techniques for non-violent civil resistance while agitating for the rights of indentured laborers) and in  Kenya . Even this is changing, though, as globalization takes hold in India and ambitious Indian firms --  most notably in oil, telecommunications and autos  -- begin to invest on the continent. Last week,  Africa  received its most expansive coverage in the Indian press when Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  arrived in Addis Ababa for the second India-Africa summit meeting. It was Singh's fourth visit to Africa in his eight years as prime minister, and his most successful. Over  six days in Ethiopia and Tanzania , he made a  number of landmark announcements , which suggests that, after decades of neglect, the relationship between the world's largest democracy and an emerging, resource-rich continent is going to be transformed. The most eye-catching number of the summit was the  $5 billion in credit lines  offered by Singh over the next three years for development projects. He also offered $700 million for new institutions and training programs along with $300 million for an  Ethiopia-Djibouti railway line . The gains that India would expect in return aren't just economic. There also are political stakes, such as the support of some or most of Africa’s 53 nations in  New Delhi 's campaign for a permanent seat on the  United Nations Security Council . The resolutions of the summit were summarized in " The Addis Ababa Declaration ," which expressed the aspirations of both parties toward a place on an expanded  Security Council . Addressing the Ethiopian Parliament, Singh described a relationship stretching to the depths of time: At the summit, Singh told a gathering of African leaders from 15 countries: Commentators were quick to compare India's ambitions in Africa with those of a rival economic power,  China . A report in  The Atlantic  last year suggested that China is now probably the single largest investor in the continent, building roads, railways, and stadiums in exchange for access to oil, minerals, and markets for Chinese goods. The business newspaper  Min t observed: India also is keen to leverage its global expertise in the  information technology , agriculture and human-resource sectors to help African countries, many of which face the same developmental hurdles as India. While China has snapped up resources through government-to-government agreements, India wants the private sector to spearhead the push to secure investments across the continent. Other voices suggested that India's economic relationship to Africa (about  $46 billion  annually in bilateral trade, less than half of China's) was more diverse and less exploitative than that of China, and was likely to be better received in the long run. An  editorial in Mint  said: And  an editorial in The Hindu  stressed the need for India to take its own course in Africa: Over the last decade, Indian businesses have laid down a substantial footprint in Africa (a map of their presence can be found  here ). The biggest of these entities is the telecom company  Bharti Airtel Ltd. , which last year bought the  African holdings  of  Kuwait 's Mobile Telecommunications Co. for $10.7 billion. Bharti Airtel's chief executive, Sunil Mittal,  said  at the summit that his company would invest a further $1 billion this year to expand its network over 16 African countries. Perhaps the day is not far off when Indian families think of  Dar es Salaam , Accra or  Addis Ababa  for their annual vacations instead of East Asia or  Europe , and Indian films are shot on the savannahs of Kenya or in the dance halls of Dakar, instead of in  London  and  New York . So, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to have a look at air-ticket prices to Africa.
