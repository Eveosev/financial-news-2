About 100  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) 
current and former employees in  Japan  may have failed to declare
taxable assets worth about 2 billion yen ($25 million), the
Yomiuri newspaper said.  The  Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau  told the employees that
they may have omitted to report stocks in overseas accounts
after exercising options for JPMorgan shares, the newspaper
reported, without saying how it obtained the information.  JPMorgan isn’t aware of an investigation by the authorities
against the employees, the bank said in an e-mailed statement.  “We have worked and will work in close cooperation with
Japan’s tax authorities to provide all necessary personal
compensation information of each JPMorgan employee,” the
statement said.  A spokesman at the taxation bureau who declined to be
identified, citing bureau policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
