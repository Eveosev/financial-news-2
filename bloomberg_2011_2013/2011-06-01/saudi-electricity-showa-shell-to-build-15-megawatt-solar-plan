Saudi Electricity Co. (SECO) ,  Saudi Aramco 
and Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K. will develop a solar plant with
capacity of as much as 15 megawatts on the kingdom’s Farasan
Island, 30 times more than a project announced yesterday.  Saudi Electricity will get the power from the photovoltaic
plant and will assume ownership from Showa Shell after 15 years,
Ali al-Barrak, the chief executive officer of the Saudi utility
company, said in an interview in Dammam,  Saudi Arabia .  Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf oil producers are
boosting power supplies to meet the demands of growing economies
and populations without burning valuable crude as fuel for power
stations. The state-controlled utility agreed with Showa Shell
to develop a 500-kilowatt solar-power plant on Farasan Island
that would start in July, according to a statement on the
Japanese refiner’s website.  “This is only a pilot project and we will develop next a
10- to 15-megawatt plant using the same photovoltaic
technology,” al-Barrak said, without giving a timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
