The Trans  Alaska  Pipeline System will
be shut for two days in July for major maintenance, according to
operator Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.  The line will be shut July 16 and July 17, said  Michelle Egan , a spokeswoman for Alyeska. Oil normally carried on the
line will be stored while the work goes on, she said.  Production in Alaska averaged 615,348 barrels a day in May,
according to the stateâ€™s tax department. The 800-mile (1,287-
kilometer) Trans Alaska system runs from  Prudhoe Bay  on the
North Slope to Valdez, the northernmost ice-free port in the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
