This year’s round of  European Union 
bank stress-test results may be delayed until next month, a
 European Banking Authority  official said.  The EBA, which is conducting the stress tests, has asked
banks to submit more information, the official, who declined to
be identified by name because the talks are private, said today.
The EBA said as recently as March that it would publish the
results this month.  A date for publication hasn’t been set, because the EBA
must ensure it is satisfied with the quality of submissions from
the banks, the EBA official said today.  Ninety banks will be expected to maintain a Core Tier 1
capital ratio of at least 5 percent under the stress-test
scenarios, the EBA has said. This year’s exams will include a
review of how lenders would handle a 0.5 percent economic
contraction in the euro area in 2011 as well as a 15 percent
drop in European equity markets.  The EBA tests will also examine the effect of a 75 basis-
point-jump in  interest rates  on European sovereign bonds and an
increase in short-term inter-bank financing costs of 125 basis
points.  To contact the reporter for this story:
