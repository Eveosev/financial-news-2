Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year note
yields below 3 percent for the first time in 2011 after ADP
Employer Services reported that U.S. companies added fewer jobs
in May than economists forecast.   Yields dropped last month the most since August 2010 before
the Labor Department’s payrolls report this week, which is
forecast to show hiring slowed. U.S. manufacturing expanded at
the slowest pace in seven months, a report today is forecast by
economists to show.  “Clearly the ADP number was much weaker than expected,
continuing a trend of weaker data over the last two weeks that
seems to be getting worse,” said  Dan Greenhaus , chief economic
strategist at Miller Tabak & Co. in  New York . “The flight-to-
safety trade is in full force because the number raises concern
about the strength of Friday’s jobs data.”  Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 3 percent at 9:09 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125 percent
securities due in May 2021 increased 1/2, or $5 per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 1/32. The yield slid to 2.9997 percent, the
lowest level since Dec. 7.  Treasuries returned 1.6 percent in May, the most since
August, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, as
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis and a weakening U.S. economy
fueled demand for government debt.  Company Hiring  Companies in the U.S. added 38,000 workers in May compared
with the addition of 177,000 in the previous month, ADP reported
today. The median forecast of 37 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey was for an increase of 175,000.  “The headline was pretty terrible,” said Ira Jersey, an
interest-rate strategist in New York at Credit Suisse Group AG,
one of 20 primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed.
“Ten-year notes have bounced off of the 3 percent level as
there is still a lot of other data to give the market direction
this week.”  Employers added 180,000 positions last month after an
increase of 244,000 in April, the Labor Department is forecast
by economists to report June 3. The  unemployment rate  may have
fallen to 8.9 percent to 9 percent.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index
probably decreased to 57.1 last month from 60.4 in April,
according to the median forecast of economists before today’s
report from the Tempe, Arizona, group. Figures greater than 50
signal expansion.  Break-Even Rate  The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the debt known as the
break-even rate, fell to 2.22 percentage points today, the
narrowest since January.  The Fed plans to buy $6 billion to $8 billion of debt
maturing from December 2016 to May 2018 today to support the
economy under its $600 billion program of quantitative easing,
which expires this month.  Futures contracts show that the likelihood of a Fed rate
increase by March 2012 has dropped to 26 percent from 44 percent
a month ago. The central bank has kept its target for overnight
lending in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  Deutsche Bank AG, a primary dealer, said the end of the
central bank’s bond-buying program may send stocks lower,
maintaining demand for Treasuries.  “The risks are tilted towards a decline in equities,”
analysts including  Peter Hooper , Torsten Slok, Joseph Lavorgna,
and  Carl Riccadonna  wrote in a report yesterday. “This argues
for the Fed staying on hold and long rates staying low.”  Treasury gains will still give way to losses later this
year, according to economists’ estimates. Yields will advance to
3.82 percent by Dec. 31, according to the average forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of banks and securities companies, with
the most recent forecasts given the heaviest weightings.  To contact the reporters on this story:
