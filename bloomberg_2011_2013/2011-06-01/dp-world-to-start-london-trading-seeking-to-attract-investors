DP World Ltd. (DPW)  shares in London were
trading at a premium of 1.7 percent to today’s closing price on
Nasdaq Dubai as the Dubai World-controlled company’s stock
debuted on the London Stock Exchange.  The shares were at 840 pence ($13.80) at 12:04 p.m. in the
British capital after gaining to as high as 880 pence. The stock
rose 0.9 percent to $13.57 on Nasdaq Dubai, reversing a decline
of as much as 1.9 percent.  “The aim is to provide an additional platform to invest in
DP World shares to help attract a broader range of investors,”
it said today. DP World, which operates ports from  Europe  to
 Asia , cross-listed 830 million ordinary shares to attract
investors after low trading volumes in its home market.  “Liquidity will improve and so will visibility, both
factors will aid in better pricing” after the  London  listing,
said Hassan El Salah, head of institutional equities at Al Ramz
Securities LLC.  DP World said last year it would seek a listing in London
to improve investors’ perception of its value after the shares
slumped 68 percent in 2008. The Nasdaq Dubai listed stock gained
47 percent last year and 10 percent in 2009.  The company raised $4.96 billion in the  Middle East ’s
biggest initial public offering in November 2007, selling 3.818
billion shares, or 23 percent of its equity, at $1.30 each. The
company last month received approval to consolidate its stock,
with shareholders receiving one $2 share for every 20 existing
shares of 10 cents each after the consolidation.  Dubai World, the state-owned holding company that controls
DP World and that sought to alter the terms on about $25 billion
of debt, signed a final deal with creditors in March, marking
the end of a restructuring that roiled global markets in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
