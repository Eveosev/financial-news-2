Pakistan’s inflation accelerated in
May, holding above 13 percent for the third straight month and
increasing pressure on the central bank to raise  interest rates .  Consumer prices rose 13.23 percent from a year earlier,
according to  Federal Bureau of Statistics  data released at a
news conference in Islamabad today. That compares with a 13.04
percent gain reported earlier for April.  The  State Bank  of Pakistan kept the discount rate unchanged
at 14 percent in May to support economic growth as it awaited
this week’s budget for signs the government will tighten fiscal
policy and help contain price pressures. The central bank raised
rates in three consecutive meetings from July to November,
blaming state spending for pushing inflation to more than 15
percent late last year.  “We see average inflation to be around 14 percent,” Sayem Ali, a Karachi-based economist at Standard Chartered Plc, said
before the report. “There is a higher chance that the
government will keep printing money.”  The government cut domestic fuel prices as much as 6.5
percent today, reducing the price of gasoline to 88.23 rupees
($1.03) a liter from 88.41 rupees and light-diesel oil to 82.52
rupees from 88.30 rupees, the Islamabad-based Oil & Gas
Regulatory Authority said in a statement on its website. The
price of kerosene fell to 84.65 rupees a liter from 89.70 rupees
a liter.  Pakistan ’s $162 billion economy, sapped by terrorism and
floods in 2010, is forecast by the government to expand 2.4
percent to 2.5 percent in the year through June, slower than an
earlier target of 4.5 percent. The country has the highest
inflation rate in  Asia  after  Vietnam , among 17 economies tracked
by Bloomberg in the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
