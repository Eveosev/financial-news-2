International Container Terminal
Services Inc. (ICT) , the largest Philippine port operator, offered to
buy the rest of  Portek International Ltd. (PORT)  for S$171 million
($139 million) to add terminals in Asia, Africa and Europe.  ICTSI offered S$1.20 a share for Singapore-based Portek, a
69 percent premium to the last traded price, according to a
statement today. The Manila-based company and affiliates already
own about 5 percent of the terminal operator.  ICTSI jumped 4.5 percent, the biggest gain on the benchmark
Manila index, to 52.35 pesos on speculation the deal will pare
its reliance on the Philippines, whose economy grew at the
slowest pace since 2009 in the first quarter. Portek controls
terminals in countries including Indonesia, Algeria, Malta and
Gabon, according to the statement.  Portek was suspended from trading in  Singapore  today. It
declined 2.7 percent to S$0.71 yesterday, giving the company a
market value of $87 million, according to Bloomberg data. Portek
has 150.3 million shares outstanding, according to ICTSIâ€™s
statement.  ---Editors: Neil Denslow, Terje Langeland  To contact the reporter on this story:
