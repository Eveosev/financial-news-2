South Africa ’s rand gained for a
second day to a three-week high against the dollar after a
report showed U.S. companies added fewer workers than forecast
in May, adding to evidence the  U.S. economy  is cooling.  The rand advanced as much as 0.6 percent to 6.7736 per
dollar, the strongest level since May 11. It traded 0.5 percent
stronger at 6.7886 per dollar at 3:29 p.m. in Johannesburg,
bringing its two-day rally against the U.S. currency to 2.3
percent, the best performance out of more than 20 emerging-
market currencies monitored by Bloomberg. It traded at 9.7892
per euro, little changed from yesterday’s close.  The U.S. currency declined against 15 of its 16 most-traded
peers after the private ADP Employers Services showed employment
increased by the smallest number since September. The report
fuelled speculation the  Federal Reserve  will keep its interest
rate at a record low to bolster the economy.  “Growth variables out of the U.S. are slowing,” Tradition
Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw said in a research note before the U.S. data was
released. “Against this backdrop the short-term outlook for the
rand remains positive.”  Employment increased by 38,000 in May, from a revised
177,000 in April, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
called for a 175,000 advance for May.  The rand was also buoyed for a second day by the
Competition Tribunal’s approval of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s 16.5
billion-rand ($2.4 billion) purchase of a controlling stake in
 Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) , analysts said. South Africa’s currency
had its biggest one-day jump in six months yesterday after the
tribunal’s decision. Government and labor unions opposed the
purchase, arguing it would harm local suppliers and rivals.  ‘How Much Further’  “This morning we are left wondering how much further the
Walmart/Massmart news can spur the market,”  John Cairns  and
Nema Ramkhelawan, currency strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, said in a research note. The decision “sends a
signal that the country is still open for business” and
“implies large flows into the rand,” with most flows to be
absorbed by the central bank, they wrote.  Bonds advanced. The 6.75 percent securities due 2021
increased 82 cents to 90.27 rand, driving the yield 13 basis
points, or 0.13 percentage point, higher to 8.21 percent, the
lowest since January. The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 added 42
cents to 121.815 rand, trimming the yield by 11 basis points to
7.43 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
