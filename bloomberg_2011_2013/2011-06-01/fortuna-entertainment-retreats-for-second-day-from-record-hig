Fortuna Entertainment Group NV (FORTUNA)  fell
the most in more than six months after rallying to the highest
level since the Czech bookmaker started trading in October 2010.  The stock tumbled 5.2 percent to 128.1 koruna at its 4:24
p.m. close in  Prague , its biggest one-day retreat since Nov. 23.
More than 770,000 shares changed hands, or more than six times
the daily average in the past three months. Fortuna yesterday
dropped 1.5 percent after reaching an all-time high of 149
koruna earlier in the day.  A 17 percent rally in the six days ended May 30 drove up
the stockâ€™s 14-day relative-strength index to 92. Readings above
70 suggest to technical analysts that a security may decline.
The RSI fell to 64 today.  Fortuna was the second-worst performer in the PX index of
15 companies traded in the  Czech Republic . The gauge slid 0.3
percent today, after a 0.9 percent rally yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
