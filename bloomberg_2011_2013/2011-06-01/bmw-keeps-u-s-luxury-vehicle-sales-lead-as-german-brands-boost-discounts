Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW
brand topped  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz and other luxury auto
makes in the U.S. last month, widening its lead for 2011 as the
European automakers boosted discounts.  BMW’s U.S. deliveries, helped by sales of sport-utility
vehicles and the new 5-Series sedan, rose 16 percent from a year
earlier to 20,651, the Munich-based automaker said yesterday in
a statement. Deliveries for the first five months of the year
rose 13 percent to 92,068 vehicles, to lead Mercedes’ 90,274
sales and the 77,237 deliveries by  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s  Lexus .  “BMW and Mercedes-Benz clearly will be on a photo finish
for the rest of the year,”  Jesse Toprak , vice president of
industry trends at TrueCar.com in  Santa Monica , California, said
in a telephone interview. “Lexus, for the first time in many
years, is clearly out of the running for the top spot.”  Mercedes’ discounts rose by 27 percent per vehicle in May
and BMW increased its incentives by 6.7 percent, while discounts
on Lexus models fell 51 percent, according to Truecar.  Lexus, based in Toyota City,  Japan , has been the top-
selling luxury auto brand in the U.S. on an annual basis for the
past 11 years. Its lead over BMW narrowed to 9,216 last year,
less than half the 19,473 gap in 2009. Mercedes finished in
third place last year. Lexus sales last month tumbled 45 percent
to 12,305, the company said in a statement.  ‘Lack of Supply’  “It would appear Lexus has suffered from a lack of
supply,”  Jim O’Donnell , head of BMW’s U.S. sales operations,
said in an interview. “That’s unfortunate, but it’s one of
those things.”  U.S. sales of BMW’s 5-Series models rose 84 percent last
month when X3 SUV deliveries more than tripled to 2,350, the
company said.  U.S. dealers sold 18,886 Mercedes-Benz cars and SUVs last
month, 1.8 percent more than a year earlier, Stuttgart, Germany-
based Daimler said in a statement.  The results exclude Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart cars
and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac luxury division’s sales fell
5.7 percent to 11,623 last month, as CTS sales rose 23 percent.
Sales of the STS and DTS sedans, production of which ended this
year, fell 68 percent and 34 percent, respectively.  Cadillac Fleet  Fleet sales fell 44 percent as GM tries to wean itself off
such sales, said Kurt McNeil, Cadillac’s vice president of sales.
Cadillac sold about 15 percent of its models to fleet buyers in
May and aims to reduce that to about 10 percent by the end of
the year, Todd Davis, a spokesman, said in an e-mail.  “A lot of that we drove with DTS and STS winding out of
the portfolio,” McNeil said of the fleet-sales decline in a
telephone interview yesterday. “The challenge is to just stay
pure with our new products, which we are completely committed to
doing.”  Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti sold 6,389 vehicles, a 21
percent decline from a year earlier, the company said in a
statement.  Honda Motor Co., based in Tokyo, said in a statement that
sales for its Acura brand fell 24 percent to 9,000 last month.  U.S. deliveries of  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand rose 14
percent to 10,457 vehicles, the company said in an e-mail.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 7,399 Lincoln luxury vehicles in May,
4.6 percent fewer than a year earlier, according to a statement
from the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Land Rover deliveries rose 6.7 percent to 2,891, while
Jaguar sales gained 32 percent to 1,271, Mumbai-based  Tata
Motors Ltd. (TTMT)  said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
