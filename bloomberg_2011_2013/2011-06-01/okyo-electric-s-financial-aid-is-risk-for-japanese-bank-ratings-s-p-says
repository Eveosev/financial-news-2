Japanese banks’ credit ratings are at
risk if they forgive loans made to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the
operator of a stricken nuclear power plant,  Standard & Poor’s 
said.  In a worst-case scenario, debt waivers combined with
deterioration of other loans because of the country’s record
earthquake could negatively affect the ratings on some banks,
S&P said in a statement today.  S&P this week downgraded Tokyo Electric’s credit ratings to
junk status on the risk that banks may restructure some of its
debts. Government officials last month urged creditors to assist
the utility after Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s administration
outlined a support plan that is aimed at helping it compensate
victims of the nuclear accident.  Under a “less-stressed” scenario, in which lenders reduce
 interest rates  on existing loans to Tokyo Electric, “credit
costs and the immediate impact on the banks’ profitability would
be manageable,” S&P said. Banks would still have to classify
loans as restructured according to current regulations.  Moody’s Investors Service said last month that it may cut
the debt ratings of lenders to  Tokyo Electric  if they waive
loans made before the March 11 quake and tsunami triggered the
nuclear crisis. Japanese banks’ debt ratings were also put
on review for possible downgrade by Moody’s yesterday as
deteriorating public finances may make it harder for the
government to help lenders in times of financial trouble.  To contact the reporter for this story:
