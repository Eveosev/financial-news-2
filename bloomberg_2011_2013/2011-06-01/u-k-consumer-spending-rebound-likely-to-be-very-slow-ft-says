U.K.  consumer spending  is likely to
recover more slowly than in any post-recession period since
1830, the Financial Times reported, citing its own analysis of
forecasts from the  Office for Budget Responsibility .  Households are forecast to spend 5.4 percent more in 2015
than they did before the 2008 financial crisis; at the
equivalent stages of the 1980s and 1990s recessions, spending
was 20 percent and 15 percent higher, respectively, the
newspaper said.  In the 18 significant U.K. recessions that have occurred
since records began in 1830, consumer spending rose 12 percent
above its previous peak within seven years, the FT said, citing
 Bank of England  figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
