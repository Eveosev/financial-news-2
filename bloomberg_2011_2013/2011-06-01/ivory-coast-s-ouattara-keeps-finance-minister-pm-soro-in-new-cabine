Ivory Coast’s president,  Alassane Ouattara , named his first ministerial cabinet since taking
office after a disputed election, retaining  Guillaume Soro  as
prime minister and Charles Koffi Diby as finance minister.  Soro has held the position since 2007 when he led a power-
sharing government with ex-President Laurent Gbagbo, who lost a
November election to Ouattara. Soro will also serve as minister
of defense in the 36-member administration, the government said
in a statement distributed to reporters in the commercial
capital of Abidjan today.  Both Diby and Soro were members of Ouattara’s emergency
government formed during the violent post-election crisis that
was sparked by Gbagbo’s refusal to cede power.  Ouattara was sworn in as president on May 21 after the
five-month conflict that ended when Gbagbo was captured in
Abidjan on April 11. At least 2,000 people were killed,
according to the  United Nations .  Patrick Achi, a spokesman for the government, will be
minister of economic infrastructure and Adama Toungara was named
energy minister.  To contact the reporters on this story:
