Pegas Nonwovens SA (PEGAS) , a Czech maker of
special textiles used in hygiene products and health care, plans
to build a factory in  Egypt  to supply a customer in the  Middle
East .  The final decision on the investment hinges on concluding a
contract with the unspecified customer, expected to take place
probably in the coming months, the Znojmo-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  In the first phase of the project, Pegas plans to invest
between 55 million euros ($79 million) and 60 million euros to
have production capacity of about 20,000 tons a year. The
company said it may by 2016 expand the Egyptian factory to more
than double the capacity to 50,000 tons a year, depending on
market conditions.  Founded in 1990, Pegas makes non-woven fabrics mainly for
hygiene products, the construction and medical industries. The
company operates two plants with eight production lines in the
 Czech Republic , supplying 70,000 tons of non-woven textiles
annually.  Pegas rose 1.2 koruna, or 0.3 percent, to 451.2 koruna as
of 9:42 a.m. in Prague.  To contact the reporters on this story:
