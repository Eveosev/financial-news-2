Marathon Oil Corp. agreed to buy KKR
& Co.-backed Hilcorp Resources Holdings LP’s assets for $3.5
billion, expanding output and reserves in the Eagle Ford oil and
natural-gas field in south  Texas .  Marathon will acquire leases on 141,000 net acres in
southern Texas with production equivalent to 7,000 barrels of
oil a day and may be able to claim reserves equivalent to 100
million barrels by year-end, the Houston-based producer said
today in a statement.  The  Eagle Ford  shale-rock formation holds oil, petroleum
liquids and gas. Producers use hydraulic fracturing to release
the fuel, injecting a mixture of water, sand and chemicals.
Marathon is paying the equivalent of $21,000 an acre, an analyst
said.  “This represents the strongest price paid for Eagle Ford
Shale acreage and compares favorably to the recent ‘record’
price of $16,000 an acre,”  Scott Hanold , a Minneapolis-based
analyst for  RBC Capital Markets , wrote today in a note to
clients.  Korea National Oil Corp. agreed March 21 to pay $1.55
billion, or $16,000 an acre, to  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  for a
joint-venture stake in the Eagle Ford.  Oil production in the Eagle Ford has risen from 130,819
barrels in 2008 to 3 million barrels in 2010, the Texas Railroad
Commission says on its website.  The deal values KKR’s 40 percent stake in the partnership
at $1.13 billion, the New York-based firm said today in a
separate statement. KKR had invested $400 million in June and
tripled the number of horizontal rigs Hilcorp operated in the
Eagle Ford shale to six.  ‘North American Position’  “This transaction enhances our already strong North
American position,” Clarence P. Cazalot, Marathon’s chief
executive officer said in today’s statement. Marathon, which
produced the equivalent of 412,000 barrels of oil a day in 2010,
expects annual increases of 5 percent to 7 percent, Cazalot
said. That’s up from a previous forecast of 3 percent to 5
percent annually.  Marathon plans to spin off its refining and marketing
businesses June 30 as Marathon Petroleum Corp.  Marathon Oil
Corp. (MRO)  will then operate as an independent exploration and
production company.  Jeffrey Hildebrand, CEO of closely held Hilcorp, ranked 205
on Forbes’s list of the 400 richest Americans this year, with a
net worth of $1.9 billion. Hildebrand is a former Exxon Mobil
Corp. geologist, according to the magazine.  KKR Energy Sales  The sale of Hilcorp marks the second time in a year that
KKR exited an energy exploration and production investment with
significant returns. KKR sold shale-gas developer East Resources
Inc., a 1-year-old minority investment, to Royal Dutch Shell
Plc, generating a four fold profit for the firm.  Marathon fell 94 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $53.23 at 9:49
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. KKR rose 9
cents to $17.28.  Barclays Plc served as a financial adviser to Marathon and
Baker Botts LLP was its legal adviser. Jefferies & Co. Inc.
advised Hilcorp and Andrews Kurth LLP provided legal advice.
Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett LLP served as legal adviser to KKR.  The transaction is expected to close Nov. 1, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
