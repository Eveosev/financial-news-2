Czech manufacturing growth slowed to
the weakest level in 15 months in May as the pace of new orders
for businesses weakened, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI was 55.9,
compared with 59 in the previous month, the steepest one-month
fall since December 2008, the bank said today in an e-mailed
report. A reading greater than 50 signals overall growth.  Manufacturers received a greater volume of new orders in
May, although the rate of growth slowed to the weakest since
February 2010.  “The latest data signaled a broad-based easing in momentum
across both domestic and export markets,” the bank said in the
Purchasing Managers Index report, compiled by Markit, a
financial information services company.  The Czech central bank is weighing the pace of economic
recovery and inflation risks as its board deliberates when to
start raising  interest rates  from a record low. The bank
signaled in the latest forecast it may lift the benchmark two-
week repo rate from 0.75 percent in the fourth quarter.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI is based on data
compiled by Markit from monthly replies to questionnaires sent
to purchasing executives in over 250 manufacturing companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
