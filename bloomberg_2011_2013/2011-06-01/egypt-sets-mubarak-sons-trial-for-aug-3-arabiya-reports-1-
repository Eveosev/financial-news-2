Egypt set the trial of former
president  Hosni Mubarak  and his two sons for Aug. 3,  Al Arabiya 
reported, citing an unidentified official at the judiciary.  In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the
the rule of law should be followed in the case.  “We want to see appropriate due process and procedures
followed in any trial and particularly in such a highly charged
trial as that will surely be,” Clinton told reporters at the
State Department today.  She said the Obama administration was disturbed by reports
of attempts to crack down on journalists and judges. “I don’t
think that’s in keeping with the direction Egyptians were
heading when they started out in Tahrir Square,” Clinton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
