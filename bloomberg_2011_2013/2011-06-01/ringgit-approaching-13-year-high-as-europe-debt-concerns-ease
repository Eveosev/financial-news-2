Malaysia ’s ringgit rose for a fifth
day, the longest run of gains since April, as the prospect of
higher  interest rates  helped draw funds amid optimism European
leaders will prevent a regional debt crisis from escalating.  The currency rose toward a 13-year high on speculation
Malaysia’s central bank will raise interest rates as early as
next month, or favor currency gains, to damp inflation after
increases in gas and electricity tariffs. European Union leaders
will decide on additional aid for Greece by the end of June and
have ruled out a “total restructuring” of the nation’s debt,
 Jean-Claude Juncker , head of the group of euro-area finance
ministers, said May 30.  “Risk appetite has increased as the debt situation in
 Europe  is stabilizing,” said Yeo Chin Tiong, head of financial
markets at Alliance Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “I won’t be
surprise if the ringgit retests its recent high given
speculation of an interest-rate hike.”  The ringgit strengthened 0.2 percent to 3.0065 per dollar
as of 4.25 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency has strengthened 1.7 percent in the past
five days. It reached 2.9598 on May 2, the strongest since 1997.  Inspectors from the EU, the  International Monetary Fund  and
the  European Central Bank  are set to wrap up a review of
Greece’s progress in meeting the terms of last year’s 110
billion-euro ($158 billion) bailout in the next few days. The EU
will then formulate its plan for further aid to  Greece .  Rate Outlook  The Malaysian government increased tariffs for gas and
power today in a bid to cut its subsidy bill, a move that will
push consumer prices higher. Inflation hit a two-year high of
3.2 percent in April and Bank Negara Malaysia raised its
overnight policy rate to 3 percent from 2.75 percent on May 5,
saying the economy is on a steady growth path.  The rate will be boosted by at least a quarter of a
percentage point in the next three months, according to six of
13 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The bank next meets to
review borrowing costs on July 7.  Benchmark 10-year notes fell. The yield on the 4.16 percent
note due July 2021 rose two basis points or 0.02 percent, its
highest level in a week, according to Bursa Malaysia. The price
increased 0.10 or 1.00 ringgit per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to
101.10.  The treasury plans to sell 10- and 20-year bonds this month,
according to its sale calendar.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
