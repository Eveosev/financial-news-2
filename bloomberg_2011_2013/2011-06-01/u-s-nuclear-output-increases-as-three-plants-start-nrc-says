U.S. nuclear-power production rose 1
percent after reactors started in  Pennsylvania ,  Alabama  and
 Georgia , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported.  Power generation nationwide increased by 825 megawatts from
yesterday to 82,007 megawatts, or 81 percent of capacity,
according to an NRC report today and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Sixteen of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  is operating the 1,134-megawatt Limerick 2
reactor in Pennsylvania at 3 percent of capacity after it
automatically shut on May 29 because of low pressure in the
electro hydraulic control and on May 30 because two
recirculation pumps tripped offline.  The unit returned to service April 23 from a refueling and
maintenance outage that began March 28. The plant is about 30
miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia. Another reactor
at the site, the 1,134-megawatt Limerick 1, is operating at full
power.  The  Tennessee  Valley Authority is operating the 1,115-
megawatt Browns Ferry 3 at 20 percent of capacity as the Alabama
plant returns to service after storms April 27 knocked out parts
of the regional transmission grid.  The 1,065-megawatt Browns Ferry 1 and the 1,104-megawatt
Unit 2 reached full power last weekend at the plant 84 miles
north of Birmingham on Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee line.  Southern Co. (SO)  is operating the 883-megawatt Edwin I. Hatch 2
reactor at 7 percent of capacity after it was shut May 28. The
876-megawatt Hatch 1 is operating at full power at the plant 74
miles west of Savannah.  The TVA boosted the 1,123-megawatt Watts Bar 1 reactor in
Tennessee to 45 percent of capacity from 25 percent yesterday
after the unit automatically shut May 29 because a turbine
tripped offline. The unit, 55 miles southwest of Knoxville, was
closed for refueling April 4.  Scana Corp. (SCG)  increased output from the 966-megawatt Virgil
C. Summer reactor in  South Carolina  to 48 percent of capacity
from 20 percent yesterday following a refueling outage. The
plant is near Jenkinsville, about 26 miles northwest of
Columbia.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
