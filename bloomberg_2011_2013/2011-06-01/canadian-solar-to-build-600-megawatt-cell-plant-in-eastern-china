Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , a Chinese solar
power equipment maker, will build a photovoltaic cell
manufacturing facility in Eastern  China .  The plant will have annual production capacity of 600
megawatts and will be built about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from
Canadian Solar’s existing cell factory in Suzhou, the company
said today in a statement.  Construction will begin after local permits are obtained
and is expected to be completed in 2012. Suzhou-based Canadian
Solar will provide 61 percent of the registered equity.
Additional financial details of the deal weren’t disclosed.  Canadian Solar announced yesterday a joint venture  with
GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Inc., China’s largest polysilicon
maker, to build a 600-megawatt wafer production plant in Suzhou.
Including existing long-term supply agreements and internal
wafer capacity, Canadian Solar expects to reach at the start of
next year 2 gigawatts of production capacity, from wafers to
solar cells to completed modules, according to the statement.  The company fell 44 cents, or 4.47 percent, to $9.41 at
2:20 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
