Florida  Governor  Rick Scott  was sued
by the  American Civil Liberties Union  over drug testing for
state employees.  The suit, filed in Miami federal court yesterday, claims
the law, which allows Florida to take urine and hair samples
before hiring state workers, is an unreasonable search and
seizure. The law also allows current state workers to be tested.
The suit seeks an immediate stop to the practice.  Scott, a 58-year-old Republican, signed the measure into
law on March 22.  The U.S. Supreme Court “has held that suspicionless drug-
testing by the government is an unreasonable search,” according
to the suit. The high court said a search is permitted only
under “special circumstances” such as employees who work in
positions where there is “concrete danger of real harm,”
according to the suit.  A spokesman for Scott didn’t immediately return a telephone
call seeking comment.  People seeking welfare in the state also must undergo drug
testing, according to a measure signed into law yesterday by
Scott.  The 1996 Welfare Reform Act gave states authority to test
recipients for illegal drug use, according to a fact sheet from
the ACLU.  Michigan , which was the only state to implement
mandatory drug testing before 2008, scrapped its law in 2003
after a U.S. district court judge found it unconstitutional.  To contact the reporter on this story:
