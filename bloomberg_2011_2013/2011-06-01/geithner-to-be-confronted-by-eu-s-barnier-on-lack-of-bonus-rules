Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial services commissioner, will confront U.S. Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  over the lack of American rules to
restrict bonuses for financial-services workers.  The absence of binding laws regulating bankers’ pay in the
U.S. means lenders can avoid curbs envisaged by the Group of 20
Nations in Pittsburgh in 2009, Barnier will tell Geithner when
they meet in  Washington  tomorrow.  Only the EU has imposed such rules and the U.S. approach
“to go for non-binding measures leaves too much latitude” for
banks and “allows them to circumvent the principles set out in
Pittsburgh,” Barnier’s spokeswoman  Chantal Hughes  said in an e-
mail about the meeting.  Financial watchdogs and politicians across the world
sought to overhaul bonus policies following the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008 to prevent bankers from
taking excessive risks in order to reap short-term gains.
Barnier has said further action may be needed in the 27-nation
region to prevent bonus payouts at “unjustifiable levels.”  Under EU rules, as much as 60 percent of a bonus payout for
risk-takers and senior managers must be deferred for at least
three years, and half of the remaining amount must be in the
form of shares.  The  Financial Stability Forum , the  Financial Stability
Board ’s predecessor, published a set of  principles  in 2009
including that bonus payments should be deferred to take account
of the lenders’ exposure to risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
