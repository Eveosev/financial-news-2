JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. settled a dispute over $222.3 million in
claims on the defunct firm that the second-biggest U.S. bank
inherited when it bought Washington Mutual Bank after Lehman’s
September 2008 bankruptcy.  The settlement was disclosed in a court filing today.
Details weren’t given.  The WaMu claims stemmed from a swap agreement it had with
Lehman’s special-financing unit, according to proofs of claim
filed by JPMorgan. The New York-based bank paid itself back for
what was owing by taking collateral deposited with it by Lehman,
according to the claim documents. Lehman had objected that $80
million of the collateral was part of a guarantee agreement that
JPMorgan wasn’t entitled to draw on.  The settlement doesn’t affect Lehman’s ongoing $8.6 billion
lawsuit against JPMorgan. JPMorgan, Lehman’s main clearing bank
in the 2008 credit crisis, is trying to get the suit dismissed.  The two companies are due to present their agreement on the
WaMu claims to a Manhattan bankruptcy judge tomorrow.  The bankruptcy case is In re  Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ,
08-13555,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan). The adversary case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
