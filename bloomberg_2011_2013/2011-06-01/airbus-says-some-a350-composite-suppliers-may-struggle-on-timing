Airbus SAS said some suppliers to its
A350 jet are encountering quality issues as they prepare for
full production of composite parts for the wide-body aircraft,
increasing pressure to keep the delivery schedule.  “This is the moment of truth, where everything that’s been
designed has to be produced,” Airbus Chief Operating Officer
Fabrice Bregier told the French Aerospace Journalists’
Association in Paris today. The program “requires a production
quality that some suppliers weren’t used to.”  Airbus, which has already pushed back the plane’s first
delivery by about six months to late 2013, is keeping the
revised schedule, Bregier said. The long-range A350 is a twin-
engine plane that follows rival  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s lead in making
increased use of composites to reduce weight and save fuel.  While production of larger composite panels is well
prepared, manufacturers are struggling with some smaller,
specialized parts such as wiring clips and stiffeners, Bregier
said. Airbus is seeking to avoid further delays and the cost
overruns that dogged its A380 superjumbo and the Boeing 787
Dreamliner.  Lessons  “The lesson we’ve learned from the A380 is that you
shouldn’t begin assembly too early,” Bregier said. “It’s more
important to get everything right, so we’re not taking any
shortcuts.”  The size of the A350, which will seat 300 to 350
passengers, puts it in competition with Boeing’s 777 model
already in service and the Dreamliner, which starts at 270 seats
and is scheduled to enter service later in September -- three-
and-a-half years later than originally promised.  Airbus plans to discuss progress on the A350 at the  Paris
Air Show , which beings June 20. Bregier said today that the
first delivery to Qatar Airways Ltd. is still on schedule.  Airbus had 574 orders for the A350 as of the end of April.
That included all three variants, the A350-800, the A350-900 and
the A350-1000. The mid-sized A350-900 is first of the three
types scheduled for service.  The planemaker is scheduled to start assembling the first
A350 by the end of the year, at a plant in Toulouse that has
been built for the purpose.  The A380, the most recent civilian jet created by Airbus,
is 25 percent made from composites. Bregier said Airbus expects
to deliver about 25 A380s this year, and the rate will increase
in 2012, though no figure has yet been decided. Airbus is
scheduled to start assembling the first A350 by the end of the
year in Toulouse.  Airbus expects to have more than 500 orders in its books
for the A320neo single-aisle jet by the end of the Paris Air
Show, which begins June 20, Bregier said. The planemaker already
has won 332 orders and commitments for the plane, with many of
the commitments to be firmed up at the show.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story: Laurence Frost in Paris at   lfrost4@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
