Thailand ’s baht strengthened for a
fifth day as economists predicted the central bank will raise
borrowing costs for a fourth time this year when it meets today.  Consumer prices rose 4.3 percent from a year earlier in
May, the most since September 2008, according to the median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey before a government
report today. The Bank of Thailand will boost the one-day bond
repurchase rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 3 percent
when it reviews monetary policy after the release of the
inflation data, according to all 16 economists in a separate
Bloomberg poll.  “Inflation risks in  Asia  are rising and regional central
banks will continue to boost  interest rates , supporting the
currencies,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian
and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in
 Tokyo . “The baht may also see appreciation pressure like other
Asian currencies.”  The baht rose 0.1 percent to 30.28 per dollar as of 8:11
a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Thai currency may strengthen to about 30 by the end of June,
Shiroki said.  The one-year onshore interest-rate swap, the fixed cost
needed to receive a floating payment, was 3.155 percent from
3.16 percent yesterday.  The yield on the 3.125 percent bond due December 2015
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.45
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
