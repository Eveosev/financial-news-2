Australia ’s Queensland state has
invited companies to bid for the right to develop as many as
four additional terminals at the Abbot Point coal port that may
cost A$6.2 billion ($6.6 billion).  The construction, combined with other expansion plans, will
make Abbot Point one of the world’s largest coal ports, Premier
Anna Bligh said today in a statement. It will have seven
terminals and capacity of about 300 million metric tons a year,
she said.  The proposed expansion is aimed at meeting rising Asian
demand for the commodity, Bligh said.  Adani Enterprises Ltd. (ADE) ,
 India ’s biggest coal importer, agreed last month to pay A$1.8
billion for a 99-year lease on the terminal.  “These expansions will further cement Queensland as the
world’s largest exporter of coal and are critical to the economy
and wealth of Queensland,” Bligh said.  Construction may begin in 2015 and first coal exports from
the fourth terminal may start in 2017, according to the
statement. The most recent expansion of Abbot Point takes
capacity to 50 million tons a year, the government said.  Each of the proposed terminals would have a capacity of 30
million tons a year, the government said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
