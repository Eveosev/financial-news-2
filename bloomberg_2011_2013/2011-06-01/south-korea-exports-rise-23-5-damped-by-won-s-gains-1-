South Korea ’s exports expanded at a
slower-than-expected pace in May.  Exports climbed 23.5 percent from a year earlier, compared
with a revised 25.1 percent gain in April, the Ministry of
 Knowledge Economy  said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 10 economists was for a 27.7 percent gain.  Policy makers are weighing the threat from inflation
against the risk that exports may cool from a record,
undermining the economy’s expansion. The won has gained more
than 4 percent this year, damping exporters’ price
competitiveness while helping curb inflation exceeding the
central bank’s target ceiling.  The South Korean currency gained 0.06 percent to 1,078.45
per dollar as of 9:25 a.m. in  Seoul , according to the data
compiled by Bloomberg, while the Kospi stock index dropped 0.34
percent. A separate report today showed consumer prices exceeded
the central bank’s target for a fifth straight month in May.  Exports fell to $48 billion from a record $49.15 billion in
April, today’s report showed. Imports climbed 29.9 percent to
$45.26 billion. The  trade surplus  was $2.75 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
