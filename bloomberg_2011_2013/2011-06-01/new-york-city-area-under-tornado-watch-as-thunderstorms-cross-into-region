The  New York  City area and parts of
the Northeast from Pennsylvania to Maine are under a tornado
watch until 8 p.m. as severe thunderstorms move through the
region, the  National Weather Service  said.  “We’re expecting tornadoes, hail up to 2 inches in
diameter, thunderstorm wind gusts up to 70 miles an hour and
dangerous lightning,” Lauren Nash, an agency meteorologist in
Upton, New York, said in a telephone interview. “We have a cold
front out to the west and another disturbance ahead of that cold
front that is going to fire up these storms.”  Tornadoes have killed more than 500 people across the U.S.
this year, including at least 120 in Joplin,  Missouri , last week
in one of the deadliest storms in the nation’s history. The
tornadoes have destroyed at least $3 billion to $6.5 billion of
insured property, said  Robert Hartwig , president of the
 Insurance Information Institute  in New York.  A tornado watch is issued when atmospheric conditions are
favorable for the formation of the storms. A warning is issued
when severe weather conditions are imminent, according to the
New Jersey Office of Emergency Management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
