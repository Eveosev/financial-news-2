UBS AG (UBSN)  is under investigation in
France after the country’s financial-institutions regulator sent
a complaint to the Paris prosecutor over the bank’s marketing
practices.  A preliminary investigation into the complaint was opened
in February and is being conducted by the French customs service
to determine if it warrants a full probe, Agnes Labregere-
Delorme, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor, said today.  “The bank is bound by particularly strict rules” in
countries where it operates, said Dominique Gerster, a spokesman
for UBS, in an e-mail. He declined to comment on the inquiry
that’s under way, and said “the bank has not put in place, nor
participated in any way, in a system to assist in  tax evasion .”  The Prudential Control Authority, or ACP as the regulator
is known, oversees banks and other financial institutions. A
spokeswoman for the authority declined to comment.  The investigation was reported earlier today by  Agence
France-Presse .  To contact the reporter on this story:
