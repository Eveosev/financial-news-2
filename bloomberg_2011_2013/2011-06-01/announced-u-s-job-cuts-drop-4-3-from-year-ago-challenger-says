Employers in the U.S. announced fewer
job cuts in May than a year earlier, signaling the labor market
is improving.  Planned firings dropped 4.3 percent to 37,135 last month
from May 2010, according to figures released today by Chicago-
based Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Government and nonprofit
agencies had the most cutbacks.  Announced job reductions in the first five months of 2011
were down 21 percent from the year-earlier period, consistent
with other data that indicate the economic expansion is
prompting companies to retain staff. A report this week will
show the world’s largest economy added jobs for the eighth
consecutive month, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “It is unlikely that we will see a sudden resurgence in
corporate downsizing in the months ahead unless there is a major
shock to the economy,” John A. Challenger, chief executive
officer of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.
While there are recent “signs of weakness” that include slower
manufacturing and a struggling housing market, the report
suggests “employers do not see these as long-term problems,”
he said.  Compared with April, job-cut announcements rose 1.8
percent. Because the figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal
effects, economists prefer to focus on year-over-year changes
rather than monthly numbers.  Government and nonprofit entities led the firings with
14,755 announcements in May. The cutbacks are bleeding into the
private sector, reflected in a “mini-surge” in firings in
aerospace and defense, the report said. Cuts of 5,778 in May
brought that industry’s reduction to 17,570 in the first five
months, compared with 19,150 firings for all of 2010.  California led all states with 5,174 announced job cuts in
May, while Louisiana had the next-largest reductions, at 4,600.  Hiring Cools  Hiring cooled in May, the report showed. Employers
announced plans to take on 10,248 workers, down from the prior
month’s 59,648 figure that mainly reflected McDonald’s Corp.’s
plan to add 50,000 employees, according to Challenger.  A report from the Labor Department on June 3 may show
payrolls climbed by 180,000 last month, while the  unemployment
rate  fell to 8.9 percent from 9 percent, according to the median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Private
companies added 210,000 jobs after a 268,000 gain the prior
month, economists predicted.  Challenger’s data do not always correlate with figures on
payrolls or first-time jobless claims as reported by the
government. Many job cuts are carried out through attrition or
early retirement. Some employees whose job are eliminated find
work elsewhere in their companies and many announced staff
reductions never take place because business improves. The
totals also include foreign affiliates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
