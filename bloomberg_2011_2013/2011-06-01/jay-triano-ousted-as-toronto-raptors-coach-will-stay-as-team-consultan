Jay Triano won’t return as coach of
the  Toronto Raptors  next season after the National Basketball
Association team declined to exercise an option in his contract.  The search for a new coach, the eighth in franchise
history, will begin immediately, the Raptors said in an e-mailed
statement today. Triano will be retained as a special assistant
to the president and general manager, the release said.  “After almost three full seasons of observation and
evaluation, I believe that bringing in a new voice as head coach
will accelerate the progress we are looking to make in the
coming years,” Raptors General Manager Bryan Colangelo said in
the statement.  Toronto never had a winning record under Triano. The
Raptors followed a 40-42 mark in 2009-10 by registering the
third-worst performance in the league this past season at 22-60.
Triano took over on an interim basis on Dec. 3, 2008, following
the dismissal of Sam Mitchell. Toronto finished 33-49 that
season, with Triano leading the team to a 25-40 record.  Triano, 52, has spent nine seasons at the Raptors and
leaves the post with an 87-142 record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
