The dollar may drop below 80 yen as
Treasury yields extend declines, according to  Greg Anderson , a
senior currency strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York.  U.S. 10-year note yields fell below 3 percent today for the
first time since December after ADP Employer Services said U.S.
companies added fewer jobs in May than economists forecast and
another report showed manufacturing expanded at the slowest in
more than a year. Growth in nonfarm payrolls slowed to 180,000
jobs last month, from 244,000 in April, economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News said before a Labor Department report on June 3.  “If the payrolls report comes in weak like the ADP report,
and we get U.S. 10-year yields falling below 3 percent and two-
year yields dive below 40 basis points, you’re probably going to
see dollar-yen fall below 80 yen, with potential to go to 79 or
78 on a short-term dip,” Anderson said in a telephone
interview. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Benchmark 10-year note yields dropped as much as 10 basis
points to 2.96 percent, the lowest level since Dec. 7. Yields on
two-year notes fell three basis points to 0.44 percent, also the
lowest since Dec. 7.  The dollar weakened 0.8 percent to 80.84 yen today in  New
York , from 81.52 yen yesterday. It reached 80.68 yen, the lowest
intraday level since May 16. The Japanese currency was last
below 80 on May 5. It last touched 78 on March 17 as it surged
to a record 76.25 after the nation’s worst earthquake.  Treasury yields and the dollar have declined as investors
sought the perceived safety of  U.S. government debt  amid signs
growth in the world’s largest economy is cooling, Anderson said.  U.S. companies hired 38,000 workers in May, compared with a
Bloomberg News survey forecast of 175,000 and a revised 177,000
in April, according to ADP Employer Services figures. The
 Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell more than
projected to 53.5 last month, the lowest level since September
2009, the group said today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
