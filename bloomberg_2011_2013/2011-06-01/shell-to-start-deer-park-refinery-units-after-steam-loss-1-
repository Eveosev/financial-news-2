Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  will begin
restarting units at its refinery in Deer Park,  Texas , at 1 p.m.
local time, after a steam loss earlier today.  A filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality
said the units being restarted included an alkylation unit, a
hydrocracker, and two hydrotreaters.  Shell lost power to all units at its refinery earlier today
after losing steam from an external supplier, two people with
knowledge of plant operations said. Steam has been restored, the
filing said.  The steam loss occurred at 4 a.m. local time after an
interruption to the electric grid operated by CenterPoint Energy
Inc., according to Norma Dunn, a spokesman for Calpine Corp.,
the steam supplier to the refinery.  The refinery can process 340,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to the companyâ€™s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
