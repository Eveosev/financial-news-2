(Correct size of movement in overnight rate in paragraph eight.)  Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to a three-
week high after global investors pumped money into the island’s
stocks in the last two days.  Foreign funds bought $1 billion more local shares than they
sold on May 31 and June 1 after seven days of net selling,
according to exchange data. Speculation policy makers will
increase borrowing costs to tame rising consumer prices also
buoyed the currency. Year-on-year inflation rose 1.60 percent in
May, the most in 15 months, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg before data due June 7.  “Inflation problems persist and the market is expecting
the central bank to raise  interest rates  again this month,”
said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Polaris
Securities Co. “The stock market has been performing well.”  The  Taiwan dollar  appreciated 0.3 percent to NT$28.700
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.558 earlier, the
strongest level since May 11.  The currency was trading 0.7 percent stronger at NT$28.581
one minute before the close of trading and pared gains on
suspected intervention by the central bank, according to two
traders who declined to be identified as the monetary authority
doesn’t usually disclose such details.  The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 12.5
basis points to 1.75 percent in March. It will review borrowing
costs again on June 30, Hsu Mu-liang, director-general at the
secretariat at the Central Bank of the Republic of  China 
(Taiwan), said today.  The yield on the 1.375 percent security due March 2021, the
most-traded government debt, fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.456 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market.  The overnight rate, which measures interbank funding
availability, gained one basis point to 0.342 percent, according
to a weighted average compiled by Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
