Cuadrilla Resources Ltd. , a U.K.-
based shale explorer, suspended hydraulic fracturing near
Blackpool in northern  England  on concern it may have triggered
an earthquake in the region.  The company halted operations at its Weeton site that use
the technique known as fracking, which shoots high-pressure jets
of water, sand and chemicals underground to crack open
formations of hydrocarbons. The company will evaluate data on
the “small seismic event” on May 27 from the British
Geological Survey and the Department of Energy and Climate
change before restarting the project, it said yesterday in a
statement.  Concerns about earthquakes may add to environmental
opposition to fracking after the state of  New York  banned shale
exploration on the risk of contaminating water supplies. The
U.K. Parliament’s  Energy and Climate Change Committee  said May
24 said there’s no need to curb shale gas activities in Britain,
where they could provide the equivalent of 1.5 years of the
country’s gas consumption.  “We take our responsibilities very seriously,” said  Mark
Miller , chief executive officer of Cuadrilla. “We expect that
this analysis and subsequent consultation will take a number of
weeks to conclude and we will decide on appropriate actions
after that.”  The BGS said it recorded a 1.5 magnitude earthquake near
Blackpool on May 27 that was felt by at least one person. A
magnitude 2.3 seismic event was recorded in the same area and
similar depth in April, suggesting that “the two events share a
similar location and mechanism,” it said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
