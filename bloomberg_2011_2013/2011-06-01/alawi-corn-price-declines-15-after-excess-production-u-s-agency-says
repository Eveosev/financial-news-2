Malawi in southern  Africa  has
produced too much corn for five years, pushing prices down by 15
percent this year, the U.S. Agency for International
Development’s Famine Early Systems Network said.  Malawi has a corn surplus of 1.2 million metric tons after
production of 3.8 million tons this year and 3.5 million tons
last year, Malawi’s leader Bingu wa Mutharika told Parliament on
May 23. The country has subsidized fertilizer use the past six
years to boost  food production  and reduce poverty.  National grain storage stockpiles are not being used
because of low prices in local markets, the USAID network said.
Prices through September will probably stay below the
government-set price of 40 kwacha (27 cents) a kilogram (2.2
pounds), it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
