Natural gas futures dropped for the
first time in three days on speculation that rising production
will overwhelm demand for the power-plant fuel.  Gas futures declined 0.8 percent on an Energy Department
report yesterday that showed  U.S. natural gas production  rose
3.3 percent in March to a record as onshore output climbed.
Production advanced to 77.83 billion cubic feet a day from a
revised 75.33 billion in February, the department said in a
monthly report known as EIA-914.  “When we get some production numbers like we saw, that
doesn’t help prices,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke
Associates LLC, an energy trading company in Louisville,
 Kentucky . “We’re at the top of the trading range we’ve been in
for some time, and it’s getting difficult for the bulls to hang
onto the momentum.”  Natural gas for July delivery fell 3.7 cents to settle at
$4.629 per million British thermal units at 2:52 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have gained 5.1 percent this
year.  Gas futures’ Relative Strength Index touched 65.126
yesterday, the highest since May 3, according to Bloomberg data.
Some technical analysts use the index to track how rapidly
prices gain or retreat. A reading above 70 suggests prices may
fall.  The EIA-914 report covers gas gross withdrawals, which
include gas used for repressuring, quantities vented and flared,
and non-hydrocarbon gas removed in treating or processing
operations.  Gas Production  Output of 2.41 trillion cubic feet in March was the highest
for any month in department data going back to 1980. Production
in the lower 48 states advanced 3.8 percent to 68 billion cubic
feet a day from a revised 65.51 billion, rising for the first
time in three months.  Production in  Texas  increased 6.1 percent to 21.4 billion
cubic feet a day from a revised 20.17 billion, according to the
report.  The report, along with data released by Baker Hughes Inc.
on May 27 showing that U.S. gas rigs rose by 15 to 881, “paints
a picture of a continued higher trajectory in domestic
production,” Barclays Capital analysts led by James R. Crandell
in New York said in a note to clients today.  Gas futures yesterday settled at a four-week high of $4.666
amid forecasts of hotter-than-normal weather. Temperatures may
be above-normal in parts of the southern, eastern and central
U.S. through June 15, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in
Rockville,  Maryland .  The high in Tulsa,  Oklahoma , on June 10 may be 97 degrees
Fahrenheit (36 Celsius), 10 above normal, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The high in
Atlanta may be 96 degrees, 11 above normal.  Air Conditioning  Cooling demand in the southern central U.S. may be 25
percent above normal from June 7 through June 11,  David Salmon ,
a meteorologist at Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri , said
in a note to clients today.  Power plants  use about 30 percent of the nation’s gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  Natural gas shipments to U.S. power plants were set to
decline for the first time in three days as nuclear production
increased. Deliveries to Texas rose to a three-month high as hot
weather boosted demand.  Gas Shipments  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation dropped 1.7 percent to 19.1 million dekatherms (18.6
billion cubic feet) from yesterday’s 19.4 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg as of 9 a.m. in  New York .  U.S. nuclear-power production nationwide increased by 825
megawatts from yesterday to 82,007 megawatts, or 81 percent of
capacity, according to the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  and
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
238,168 as of 2:46 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 308,000. Volume was 376,524 yesterday. Open interest was
919,093 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
942,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
