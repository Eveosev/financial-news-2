Syria â€™s Public Establishment of
Electricity for Generation and Transmission invited companies to
bid for the design and construction of an outdoor substation.  Companies can submit bids until Aug. 2 for the 18-month
contract to build the substation in Khan Al Joz in the coastal
province of Latakia in western Syria, the state-owned utility
said on its  website .  Syria passed an energy law on Nov. 14 allowing foreign and
private local investors to generate and distribute electricity
in the country. The law still awaits executive approval to come
into effect. Syrian Electricity Minister Imad Khamis said May 19
that the executive rules of the law will be made public within
40 days.  Syria increased power exports by 70 percent to 1.05
terawatt-hours last year as domestic output increased 7.2
percent to 46.4 terawatt-hours, the Ministry of Electricity said
in a report on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
