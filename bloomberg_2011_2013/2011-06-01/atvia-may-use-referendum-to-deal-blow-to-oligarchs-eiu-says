An unprecedented referendum called by
Latvian President Valdis Zatlers for new parliamentary elections
gives citizens a chance “to deal another blow” to oligarchs,
the Economist Intelligence Unit said.  Zatlers on May 28 called the country’s first referendum on
dissolving the legislature after parliament refused to allow
investigators search the home of an opposition lawmaker. His
move has been interpreted as an attack on  Latvia ’s oligarchs who
have influenced politics after gaining profit when state assets
were sold following the collapse of the  Soviet Union .  “Latvians have shown in the past that there are limits to
their tolerance of their country’s corrupt post-communist
political practices, notably when protests forced out a
government in late 2007,” the EIU said in a research note
published late yesterday. “This scandal gives them a chance to
deal another blow to that system.”  The referendum, which won’t have a minimum threshold for
turnout, is planned for July 23. If the president’s plan is
approved, parliamentary elections would be held two months
later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
