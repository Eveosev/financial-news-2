Swiss Re Ltd., the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, said it will buy about 300,000 U.K. policies
previously owned by American International Group Inc. with
assets of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.6 billion).  Swiss Re will buy the policies from American Life Insurance
Co., which AIG sold in November to  MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest
U.S. life insurer. Simone Lauper, a spokeswoman for the Zurich
based reinsurer, declined to comment on the price.  The reinsurer’s Admin Re unit, which manages so-called
closed life book business that bundles insurance contracts and
no longer sells new policies, paid 753 million pounds in 2008
for 760,000 life and pension policies from Barclays Plc. Swiss
Re Chief Investment Officer David Blumer said the transaction
offers the company “attractive, diversified returns.”  “The deal is significant in the fact that they’ve done
one, there is business around,” said  Tim Dawson , a Geneva-based
analyst with Helvea who has a “neutral” rating on the stock.
It’s a good way of using Swiss Re’s excess capital, which
exceeded  Standard & Poor’s  requirements for a AA credit rating
by more than $10 billion at the end of last year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
