Zambia’s state-controlled mining
company agreed to sell its 2.28 percent stake in  Equinox
Minerals Ltd. (EQN)  to  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  for more than $160 million,
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings Plc said.  “After due consideration and consultation, the board of
ZCCM-IH has accepted the offer,” from Barrick, it said in a
statement published in the Lusaka-based Times of Zambia today.  The offer presented an opportunity for the Zambian company
to “realize value from its investment” in Equinox, including
an indirect stake in Jabal Sayid copper and gold project in
 Saudi Arabia , ZCCM-IH said. The company bought the shares in
Equinox for $30 million in 2006, it said.  Barrick, the world’s largest producer of gold, said
yesterday Zambia granted unconditional approval of its C$7.3
billion takeover of Equinox and the copper producer’s Lumwana
mine in the southern African country. The condition that Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines keep the stake in Equinox was removed,
according to Andy Lloyd, a spokesman for Barrick in Toronto.  Zambia’s antitrust body gave conditional approval for the
takeover on May 27. Barrick should also honor existing
agreements with a local smelter and suppliers, the  Competition
Commission  said. Zambia is  Africa ’s biggest copper producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
