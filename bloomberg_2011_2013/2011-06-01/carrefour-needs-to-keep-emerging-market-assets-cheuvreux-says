Carrefour SA (CA)  needs to keep control of
its emerging-market assets, analysts at CA Cheuvreux said in
reaction to reports that the world’s second-largest retailer may
have held discussions about a merger in  Brazil .  Retaining the businesses “is the only condition to benefit
from solid growth drivers in a mid-term view,” Cheuvreux
analysts led by Arnaud Joly wrote today in a note.  Carrefour has hired Lazard Ltd. to study a merger between
its Brazilian unit and Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao
de Acucar, Journal du Dimanche reported this month. Should the
Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based retailer want to sell its
international businesses, it may want to consider grouping and
listing them as a separate unit, activist investor Knight Vinke
Asset Management LLC said yesterday.  “We do not believe that it would make sense to regroup all
Carrefour’s emerging countries in a single vehicle to be
listed,” the Cheuvreux analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
