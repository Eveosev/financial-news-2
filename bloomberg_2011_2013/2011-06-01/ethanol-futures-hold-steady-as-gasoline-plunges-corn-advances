Ethanol futures were unchanged in
 Chicago  as gasoline declined on demand concerns and corn gained
on inclement weather that slowed planting.  The biofuel was steady as crude oil and gasoline plunged
after ADP Employer Services said employment rose by 38,000 in
May, the smallest gain since September and below an estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey of 175,000. A government report showed
about 86 percent of the corn crop was planted as of May 29,
behind the five-year average of 95 percent.  “Ethanol was basically caught in the middle,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in Chicago.
“There are a lot of macro things that came out. We really
missed the mark on the ADP report. Planting corn in June is not
good.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery settled unchanged at
$2.642 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
increased 11 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  dipped 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.725 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive lost 2 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.765, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago declined 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$2.635 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slid 3.5
cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.78.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 11 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $7.585 a bushel in Chicago. The grain has more than
doubled in the past year.  Crude oil for July delivery declined $2.41, or 2.3 percent,
to settle at $100.29 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Gasoline for July delivery fell 7.3 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to settle at $2.9773 a gallon in New York. Futures declined  9.1
percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
