The  Philippines  plans to issue new
local-currency bonds maturing in 10 and 20 years and exchange
them for existing shorter-dated notes, Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said in an interview.  “We will try to pursue an exchange this month,” Mendiola
said by phone today from Manila. State-owned lenders  Development
Bank  of the Philippines and  Land Bank  of the Philippines have
been hired to arrange the swap, he said.  The government will probably offer 60 billion pesos ($1.4
billion) each of the 10- and 20-year notes, the deputy treasurer
said. The Philippines completed in December its largest bond
exchange program when it issued 185 billion pesos of 10- and 25-
year bonds in a swap and sold 15 billion pesos of debt due 2035
to new investors.  President  Benigno Aquino , who took office in June 2010, is
seeking to stretch bond maturities and cut debt-servicing costs
in a nation that has had a budget deficit for 22 of the last 26
years. The government also wants to deepen the market for long-
term funding needed to build roads, ports and railways.  “The market will always welcome a chance to hold more
liquid bonds,” said Lito Mercado, head of trading at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. in Manila. “Now is a good time because
inflation concern has eased and liquidity remains ample.”  ‘Plain Vanilla’  The yield on the 7.375 percent debt due March 2021 rose
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.35 percent as
of 12:11 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tradition Financial
Services. It peaked at 7.50 percent when the security began
trading on March 2.  “This time, the plan is for a plain vanilla swap,”
Mendiola said, adding they probably won’t be raising new funds
unlike in December. The government had a  budget surplus  of 61
million pesos in the first four months of this year, compared
with a 131.80 billion peso deficit in the same period of 2010.  The Philippines, which has held debt swaps for both local
currency and dollar-denominated notes, is exploring the
possibility of offering peso-denominated global bonds in
exchange for dollar notes, Treasurer  Roberto Tan  said in January.  To contact the reporter for this story:
