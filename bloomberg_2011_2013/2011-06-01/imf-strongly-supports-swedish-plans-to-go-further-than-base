The  International Monetary Fund 
supports Swedish plans to implement rules for banks that are
stricter than those proposed under the Basel III global capital
framework.  Sweden’s “financial system is over five times GDP,
concentrated, and significantly short-term funded,” the IMF
said in a report published today in Stockholm. “Given the
unique characteristics and risks of the Swedish financial
system, the mission strongly endorses the authorities’ intention
to go further and faster than Basel III regulations.”  The Nordic country should put in place “strong liquidity
regulations, taking particular account of risks in foreign
currencies,” the IMF said.  The Swedish government is pushing for more stringent
 capital requirements  than those recommended by the Basel
Committee. Swedish banks’ foreign currency borrowing has risen
to about 1.5 trillion kronor ($243 billion) from 200 billion
kronor in 1998, making them vulnerable to a liquidity crisis,
Riksbank Deputy Governor Lars Nyberg said on May 17.  To contact the reporters on this story:
