U.S. stock-index futures extended
losses after a private report showed companies added fewer jobs
than forecast, fueling concern that economic growth will slow.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent
to 1,339.2 at 8:19 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones Industrial
Average futures lost 0.3 percent to 12,515.  Companies in the U.S. added 38,000 workers to payrolls in
May, according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The median
estimate in the Bloomberg News survey called for a 175,000
advance. Estimates for the ADP data ranged from increases of
125,000 to 200,000, according to the Bloomberg survey of 37
economists.  The  S&P 500  rallied yesterday as investors speculated that
Greece will receive additional financial aid. Equities advanced
even as data on  consumer confidence  and business activity
trailed economists’ estimates. Even so, the gauge fell 1.4
percent in May amid concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
worsen and the global economic recovery will slow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
