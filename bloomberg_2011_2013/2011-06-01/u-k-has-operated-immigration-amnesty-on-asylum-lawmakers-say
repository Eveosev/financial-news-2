The U.K. has effectively operated a
backdoor amnesty on illegal immigration for more than a decade
because of failings in the government agency controlling entry,
a panel of lawmakers said.  Of the backlog of as many as 450,000 asylum cases built up
since the late 1990s, 161,000 people have been granted leave to
remain and the U.K. Border Agency has been unable to trace the
applicants in about 74,500 cases, the Home Affairs Committee
said in a report published today.  “Ministers would have been unwilling to announce an
amnesty for the applicants caught up in this backlog, not least
because this might be interpreted as meaning that the U.K. was
prepared more generally to relax its approach towards
migration,” the committee said. “But we consider that in
practice an amnesty has taken place, at considerable cost to the
taxpayer.”  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s Conservative-led government,
which took office a year ago, is making it harder to come to the
U.K. in an effort to reduce net immigration to the “tens of
thousands.” The figure peaked at 233,000 in 2007 and stood at
198,000 in 2009, government figures show.  “We have known for some time that the asylum system we
inherited was chaotic,” Immigration Minister Damian Green said
in an e-mailed statement. “Some of these cases date back more
than a decade and the U.K. Border Agency was always clear that
because of the length of time many of these individuals have
been in the country there would be no alternative to granting
them leave to remain. There is no amnesty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
