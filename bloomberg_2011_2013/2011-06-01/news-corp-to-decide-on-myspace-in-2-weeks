News Corp. (NWSA)  will make a decision about
the potential sale of its MySpace social network in two weeks,
said  Jonathan Miller , head of the company’s digital media group.  “In two weeks, we’ll know something,” said Miller in an
interview after speaking at the All Things D Conference in
Rancho Palos Verdes, California.  News Corp. has said it is searching for a way to respond to
MySpace’s loss in market share to Facebook Inc. The media
company hired the New York-based investment bank Allen & Co. to
evaluate offers for MySpace, with a goal of concluding a deal
before the fiscal year ends in June, people with knowledge of
the situation said in March.  The News Corp. business group that includes MySpace had an
operating loss of $165 million in the third quarter ending in
March, compared with a $150 million loss a year earlier.  News Corp., based in  New York  and controlled by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch, fell 69 cents to
$17.65 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.  To contact the reporters on this story:
