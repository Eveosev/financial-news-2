Russia ’s weather in June will be
“mostly satisfactory” for crops,  the country’s Federal
Hydrometeorological Center  said.  “Agro-meteorological conditions for the completion of the
sowing of late crops and growth and development of most
agricultural plantings will be mostly satisfactory” across most
of European Russia, the center said today on its website.
Moisture levels for crops will be sufficient, while “a bit
reduced” in some parts of the Volga federal district and in the
extreme south of the Central federal district, according to the
statement.  Weather conditions will be “mostly satisfactory” for
completion of sowing, spring plantings’ growth and winter crops
in most parts of Russia’s Asian territories, the center said.  Sugar-beets and some varities of sunflowers and corn began
to form leaves in the central Black Earth region, the center
said. Spring sowing was finished in the areas surrounding the
Black Earth region, and grains started to shoot in most of those
places. Winter crops continued to grow and started to form heads
in some parts of the southern areas of the Central district in
the last 10 days of May, according to the statement.  Russia’s  Agriculture Ministry  estimates the total grain
harvest may be 85 million to 90 million metric tons this year,
up from 60.9 million tons last year, when the country’s worst
drought in a half century wasted crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
