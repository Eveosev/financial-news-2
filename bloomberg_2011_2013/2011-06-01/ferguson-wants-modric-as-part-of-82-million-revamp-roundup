The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Ferguson Shake-Up  Alex Ferguson  plans one of the “biggest overhauls” of his
Manchester United squad this offseason after Paul Scholes’s
retirement and the exit of several other players, the  Daily
Mirror  reported.  Ferguson is said to have up to 50 million pounds ($82
million) to spend on revamping his squad, with Luka Modric,
 Wesley Sneijder  and  Ashley Young  among the players he’s
monitoring, the newspaper said.  Tottenham midfielder Modric
is the main target.  Nasri Pay Pause  Samir Nasri’s future at Arsenal is again in doubt after
talks about a new deal stalled over pay, the  Daily Mail  reported.  The Gunners have offered Nasri a new five-year contract
worth 90,000 pounds a week, the Mail added.  Morison Fee  Millwall has told Norwich the Canaries will need to pay
almost 3 million pounds for striker Steve Morison,  the Sun 
reported.  Millwall won’t move on the price as they have to pay 25
percent of any transfer fee to Morison’s former club Stevenage,
the Sun added.  Long for Hoops?  Striker Shane Long is a target for Celtic after his Reading
team lost to Swansea in the Championship playoff final, the
 Daily Express  reported.  Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle are among other clubs
interested in the 24-year-old, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
