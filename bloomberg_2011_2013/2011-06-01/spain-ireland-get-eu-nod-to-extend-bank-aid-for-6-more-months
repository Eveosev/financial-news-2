Spain and Ireland won European Union
permission for further extensions to state guarantee programs
for banks until Dec. 31.  The guarantees are “an appropriate means of remedying a

the European Commission in an e-mailed statement today. The
regulator has said it plans next year to phase out extra state
help for banks if market conditions allow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
