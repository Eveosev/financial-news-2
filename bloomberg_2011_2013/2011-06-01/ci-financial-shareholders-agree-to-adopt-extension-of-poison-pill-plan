CI Financial Corp. (CIX)  shareholders
agreed to extend the terms of a shareholder rights plan that
would discourage hostile takeover bids.  Shareholders voted in favor to extend the so-called poison
pill until 2014, CI said at its annual meeting today in Toronto.  CI was involved in a dispute over the rights plan with its
largest shareholder,  Bank of Nova Scotia. (BNS)  The Ontario Securities
Commission, Canada’s main stock-market regulator, ruled last
week that the Toronto-based lender didn’t qualify as an
“independent” shareholder and couldn’t vote on the plan.  Scotiabank, Canada’s third-largest bank by assets,
purchased about 36 percent of CI Financial in 2008 from Sun Life
Financial Inc. for C$2.3 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
