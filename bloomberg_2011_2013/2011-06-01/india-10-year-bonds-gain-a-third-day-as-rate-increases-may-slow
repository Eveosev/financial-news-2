India ’s 10-year bonds rose for a
third day on speculation slowing economic growth will prompt the
central bank to cool the pace of interest-rate increases.  The  Reserve Bank  of India has raised its repurchase rate
three times this year to damp inflation, adding to six increases
in 2010. Gross domestic product rose 7.8 percent in the three
months ended March 31 from a year earlier, the Central
Statistical Office said in a statement yesterday. That’s the
slowest pace in five quarters. The median of 22 predictions in a
Bloomberg News survey was for an 8.1 percent advance.  “Investors are probably betting slower growth may help
temper rate increases,” said  Roy Paul , a deputy general manager
in charge of bonds and currency at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.  The yield on the 7.8 percent note due April 2021 fell nine
basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 8.33 percent at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. It touched 8.46 percent last week, the highest level
since October 2008.  The  Reserve Bank of India  is scheduled to review borrowing
costs next on June 16.  India’s manufacturing grew at the slowest pace in four
months as inflation above 8 percent and interest-rate increases
crimped output. The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 57.5 in
May from 58 in April, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said in an e-mail statement today. A number above 50 indicates
expansion.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell five basis points today to 8.13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
