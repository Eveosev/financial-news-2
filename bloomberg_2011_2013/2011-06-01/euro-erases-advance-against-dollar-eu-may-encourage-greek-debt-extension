The euro erased an advance versus the
dollar on speculation European Union officials may seek to
encourage bondholders to continue lending to Greece.  The euro was little changed at $1.4397 as of 11:39 a.m. in
 London  after advancing as much as 0.4 percent to $1.4448.  Investors may be offered preferred status, higher coupon
payments or collateral as inducements to buy bonds replacing
Greek debt maturing between 2012 and 2014, said two people with
knowledge of discussions by policy makers, who declined to be
identified because the talks are in progress.  So-called negative incentives are also under consideration,
such as cutting off old Greek bonds from eligibility for use as
collateral with the  European Central Bank , the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
