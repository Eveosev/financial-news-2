General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  reported U.S. sales in May fell, missing
analysts’ estimates, as higher gasoline prices and smaller
discount offers deterred purchases.  GM deliveries dropped 1.2 percent to 221,192 vehicles, the
Detroit-based automaker said today in a statement. The average
estimate of three analysts was for a 1.5 percent increase. Ford
light-vehicle deliveries fell 2.6 percent to 191,529, compared
with five analysts’ average estimate for a 0.5 percent decline.
Toyota’s U.S. sales plunged more than analysts’ estimated.  Gasoline that has topped $3.50 a gallon since March and
automakers’ “dramatic” cuts to incentives led some buyers to
defer purchases, said  Don Johnson , vice president of U.S. sales
at GM. Industrywide light-vehicle sales ran at an 11.8 million
seasonally adjusted annual rate, trailing the 12.1 million pace
that was the average of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “ Gas prices  did have an impact not only on what consumers
were buying but also their willingness to buy,” said Jeff Schuster, J.D. Power & Associates’ executive director of global
forecasting. “Until we see a more progressive decline or we at
least settle at a more stable level below $4 a gallon, we’ll
still have buyers hesitating and waiting out purchases.”  GM fell $1.58, or 5 percent, to $30.23 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Ford declined 69 cents,
or 4.6 percent, to $14.23. Toyota City, Japan-based Toyota’s
American depositary receipts, each representing two ordinary
shares, dropped $1.79, or 2.1 percent, to $81.50.  Toyota, Honda  Toyota and Honda Motor Co. led declines among major
automakers as Japan-based manufacturers worked to recover from
the earthquake and tsunami that idled factories and created a
shortage of parts and vehicles. The disaster may result in 3
million to 3.5 million units of global production that will be
lost or deferred until next year, according to IHS Automotive.  Toyota, which built 45 percent of its cars in  Japan  last
year, reported a 33 percent drop in May deliveries, exceeding
the 27 percent decline that was the average of three estimates.
Tokyo-based Honda, the second-largest Japanese automaker by U.S.
sales, said sales fell 23 percent, less than the 25 percent
average of three estimates.  U.S. sales for Nissan Motor Co. dropped 9.1 percent last
month, according to an e-mailed statement. The Yokohama, Japan-
based company was expected to report a 7.3 percent decline, the
average of three estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Chrysler, Hyundai Sales  Chrysler Group LLC sales rose 10 percent to 115,393
vehicles. That topped the 9.5 percent increase estimated on
average by five analysts. The  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based
company repaid $7.6 billion in U.S. and Canadian government
loans during the month.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s largest automaker,
reported a 21 percent sales increase, and affiliate  Kia Motors
Corp. (000270) ’s deliveries climbed 53 percent. The companies, which
operate separately, sold a combined 107,426 vehicles last month,
more than either Honda or Nissan.  The 11.8 million annualized sales pace for the industry in
May followed three straight months of a rate faster than 13
million and 12.6 million in January, according to researcher
Autodata Corp.  Confidence among U.S. consumers in May unexpectedly dropped
to a six-month low as incomes were squeezed by gasoline that
averaged $3.90 a gallon during the month. The percentage of
consumers planning to buy a new vehicle within six months fell
in May to 3.3 percent, the lowest since January, the New York-
based Conference Board said yesterday.  ‘Flat Spot’  “The economic recovery is in a bit of a flat spot right
now,”  Paul Ballew , chief economist for Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Co. in Columbus, Ohio, said in a telephone interview.
“When you back off on incentives, increase prices and have some
shortages among the Japanese automakers, you get a lackluster
month.”  The average price of regular unleaded gasoline was $3.78 a
gallon yesterday, according to AAA, the nation’s biggest
motoring organization. The price reached $3.99 on May 4, the
highest since July 2008.  GM, the largest U.S. automaker, repeated its forecast for
U.S. industry deliveries of 13 million to 13.5 million this
year, including medium- and heavy-duty trucks, as the automaker
expects sales to recover late in the year. The annualized sales
rate may remain below 13 million until at least August, Johnson
said today on a conference call.  ‘Temporary’ Weakness  “We expect this temporary period of weakness to be
followed by a pretty good economy in the second half,” Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, Ford’s chief economist, said today in a
conference call.  GM’s declining sales in the U.S follows a decrease in April
deliveries in  China . Weaker sales in its two biggest markets
have weighed on the automaker’s shares, which need to rise to
$53 for the U.S. Treasury Department to break even on its $50
billion bailout of the automaker.  The federal bailouts of the  auto industry  that included
assistance to GM and Chrysler may result in losses of less than
20 percent of the $80 billion provided by the U.S. Treasury
Department,  Ron Bloom , White House adviser for manufacturing
policy, said today at a briefing.  Treasury Stake  The U.S. wants to divest its ownership share of about 33
percent of GM and 6 percent of Chrysler “as soon as practical”
and the Obama administration doesn’t have a “target price” to
sell its remaining stakes, Bloom said in  Washington .  “We gave a clear signal we’re not going to be long-term
investors” in the auto industry, he said.  GM ended May with U.S. inventory of about 584,000 vehicles,
up from about 577,000 units at the end of April. There were
about 110 days of supply of large trucks at the end of May, and
inventory of the Chevrolet Cruze compact car was about 37 days.  Ford ended the month with 397,000 vehicles in U.S.
inventory, a day supply in the “low-50s,” sales analyst  George Pipas  said on a conference call. The average transaction price
for its models climbed about 4 percent in May, he said.  Ford, which said last week it raised prices by about 0.4
percent per vehicle in May, may have also reduced incentive
spending by 2.5 percent in the month to $2,283 per vehicle,
according to auto-pricing website Edmunds.com.  Incentives for the industry may have declined 0.7 percent,
led by a 46 percent drop for Honda and 27 percent decrease at
Toyota, according to Edmunds.  ‘Pricing-Driven’ Declines  The industry’s lower sales in May represent “a pricing-
driven decline, not an economic indicator,” said  Jeremy Anwyl ,
chief executive officer of  Santa Monica , California-based
Edmunds. “Sales will jump when prices drop.”  Average new-vehicle selling prices rose $608, or 2.1
percent from a year earlier, to $29,817 in May, according to
TrueCar.com, an auto-pricing website also based in Santa Monica,
 California .  Light-vehicle sales climbed to 11.6 million in 2010 from a
27-year low in 2009. Deliveries still were 31 percent fewer than
the 16.8 million annual average from 2000 to 2007, according to
Autodata. The 11.8 million rate this month is 1.7 percent higher
than the 11.6 million pace in May 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
