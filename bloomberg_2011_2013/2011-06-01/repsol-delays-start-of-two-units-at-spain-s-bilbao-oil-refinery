Repsol YPF SA (REP) , Spain’s largest oil
company, delayed the start of two units at its Petronor refinery
in Bilbao.  The visbreaker that was stopped for maintenance will be at
full capacity by June 6, the Madrid-based company said today in
an e-mailed response to questions. The halted desulfurization
plant will resume operations in about 10 days, it said. Repsol
said on May 18 that the plants would be operating in the last
week of May and in the first week of June, respectively.  Repsol started crude unit 1 and alkylation facility 3 as of
May 28, according to a  statement  posted on Petronor’s website on
May 27. It also began operations from naphtha desulfurization
plant N2, platformer P2 and gasoil desulfurization G4, according
to a statement on the  website  on May 30.  The units are running normally, according to today’s e-
mailed statement. The refinery, located in northern  Spain , has
the capacity to process 220,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Visbreakers raise the amount of diesel and gasoil that can
be processed from heavy oil-products. Desulfurization plants
remove sulfur from fuels, allowing them to burn more cleanly.
Platformers make blending components for gasoline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
