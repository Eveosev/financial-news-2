Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  lost power to
all units at its refinery in Deer Park,  Texas , after losing
steam from an external supplier, two people with knowledge of
plant operations said.  Today’s incident resulted in two small fires that were
extinguished quickly, said the people, who declined to be
identified because they aren’t authorized to speak for the
plant.  Calpine Corp., a steam supplier to the refinery, is
restoring service to the Deer Park plant, Norma Dunn, a
spokeswoman for Calpine, said in an e-mail. She said the steam
loss occurred at 4 a.m. local time after an interruption to the
electric grid operated by CenterPoint Energy Inc.  Jill Davis, a spokeswoman for Shell in Houston, declined to
comment on the status of the production units.  The incident is “causing units upset and significant
flaring,” Davis said in an e-mail.  The refinery can process 340,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
