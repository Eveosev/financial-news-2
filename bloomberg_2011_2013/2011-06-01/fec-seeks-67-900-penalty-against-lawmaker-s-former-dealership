The  Federal Election Commission  says
a Florida car dealership formerly owned by U.S. Representative
Vern Buchanan illegally reimbursed employees’ donations to his
congressional campaigns.  The FEC on May 27 asked the U.S. District Court for the
Middle District of Florida to fine the company $67,900, the
amount it allegedly spent to reimburse employees and others for
donations to the Florida Republican’s 2006 and 2008 campaigns.
  The dealership’s actions were “not a mere error or lapse in
judgment,” the FEC said in its court filing. “It was an
extensive and ongoing scheme that spanned two election cycles,
three calendar years, and dozens of secret, illegal
contributions.”  The Buchanan campaign’s finance director, Celena Thibodeux,
issued a statement describing the matter as  “an issue between
the FEC and Hyundai of North Jacksonville, which Vern Buchanan
has no interest or stake in,”  The lawsuit was filed Dec. 17 after FEC lawyers couldn’t
reach a settlement with the dealership and its owner, Sam
Kazran, who bought out Buchanan’s share of the company in 2008.  According to the commission, company funds were used to
reimburse dealership employees, Kazran’s relatives and his
business partners and their families.  Buchanan, 60, won his first House election in 2006 by 369
votes over Democrat Christine Jennings. He was re-elected in
2008 and 2010, winning last year with about 69 percent of the
vote. He is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.  The case is Federal Election Commission v. Kazran et al.,
3:10-cv-01155, U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Florida.  To contact the reporter on this story:
