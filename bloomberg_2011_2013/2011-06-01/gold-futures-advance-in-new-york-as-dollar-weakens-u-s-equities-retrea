Gold futures rose to a four-week high
as the slumping dollar and a decline in U.S. equities boosted
demand for the precious metal as an alternative asset.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped for the first time
in a week after a private report showed U.S. companies added
fewer jobs than forecast last month. The greenback touched a
three-week low against a basket of major currencies. Gold fell
1.3 percent last month after reaching a record $1,577.40 an
ounce on May 2.  “The dollar is starting to weaken again,” said  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in
 Chicago . “Stocks are selling off, and there’s a flight to
quality into gold.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose $6.40, or 0.4
percent, to settle at $1,543.20 an ounce at 1:35 p.m. on the
Comex in  New York . Earlier, the metal reached $1,551.60, the
highest since May 2. The price has gained 26 percent in the past
12 months.  U.S. manufacturing expanded in May at the slowest pace in
more than a year. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory
index fell more than projected to 53.5, the lowest since
September 2009, from 60.4 in April, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group said today.  The  Federal Reserve  has kept its benchmark interest rate at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and pledged to
buy $600 billion in Treasuries through the end of June as a part
of a so-called quantitative-easing program to help revive the
economy.  ‘Soft Patch’  “There’s a lot of iffiness about the end of QE2 and
questions about whether there will be a QE3,” said Matt Zeman,
a strategist at Kingsview Financial in Chicago. “There’s a
serious soft patch in economic data, and the Fed is not going to
be able to raise interest rates anytime soon. That’s going to be
a dollar negative and gold positive.”  Silver futures for July delivery fell 61.1 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $37.694 an ounce. In May, the metal tumbled 21
percent, the most since August 2008. The price has doubled in
the past 12 months.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell $1.90, or 0.2
percent, to $779.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for July delivery fell $10.10, or 0.6
percent, to $1,823.90 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
