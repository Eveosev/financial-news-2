BDO LLP, the accountancy firm, was
censured by the U.K.’s finance regulator for failing to alert
the country’s Listing Authority about Shore Capital Group Plc’s
planned takeover of Puma Brandenburg Ltd.  BDO, which was advising London-based investment bank Shore
Capital as its sponsor, tried to avoid classifying the deal as a
reverse merger so trading in the bank’s shares wouldn’t be
suspended, the Financial Services Authority said in a  statement
today . The firm agreed with Shore Capital, whose shares are
listed on the London Stock Exchange, to delay contacting the
U.K. Listing Authority until after the deal was announced, the
regulator said.  The reprimand is the first public censure of a sponsor by
the FSA in regards to the stock listing authority’s rules, the
regulator said.  “Sponsors provide important protections for investors and
the market under the listing regime,” Marc Teasdale, the head
of department at the UKLA, said. “They are entrusted to provide
sound and expert guidance to issuers on their obligations, and
are relied upon to be open.”  The head of advisory services at BDO,  Gervase MacGregor ,
said the partner at BDO who handled the Shore Capital matter has
since left for unrelated reasons.  “We have reviewed our guidance for sponsor work, delivered
refresher training on the regulatory regime for all corporate
finance partners and directors, and established a corporate
finance public risk committee which approves all new
transactions,” MacGregor said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter for this story:
