Japan ’s government bond futures rose
to the highest since December as the lower house of parliament
today rejected a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister  Naoto
Kan , easing concern about political instability.
　　Prior to the vote, Kan signaled he’ll resign once a solution
to the nation’s post-earthquake crisis is in sight. Ten-year
yields fell the most in about four weeks after Treasuries
advanced yesterday and before a U.S. report forecast to show
hiring slowed in May.
　　“As the political uncertainty eased, bonds were bought, but
that may not last for long,” said  Yasunari Ueno , chief market
economist at Mizuho Securities Co. in  Tokyo . “U.S. yields and
fundamentals are more important” factors to the market.
　　Ten-year bond futures for June delivery gained 0.51 to
141.05 as of the afternoon close at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
The contracts touched 141.18 earlier, the highest since Dec. 7.
　　The yield on the 1.2 percent bond due June 2021 declined
four basis points to 1.14 percent at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. That’s the biggest
yield drop since May 6. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.
　　The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average retreated 1.7 percent. Treasury
10-year yields fell 12 basis points to 2.94 percent yesterday.  U.S. Cooling Signs  　　U.S. companies added 38,000 workers to payrolls, the fewest
since September, ADP Employer Services reported yesterday. U.S.
firms added 170,000 workers in May after hiring 244,000 people
in April, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before Labor Department figures tomorrow.
　　“The global economic slowdown is causing bonds to be
bought,” said  Satoshi Yamada , who helps oversee about $12.6
billion as manager of fixed-income trading at Okasan Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo.
　　Ministry of Finance data today showed that Japanese
companies increased spending at a slower pace as the nation’s
record earthquake and ensuing tsunami knocked out power and shut
down factories.
　　 Capital spending  excluding software rose 4.2 percent in the
three months ended March 31 from a year earlier, after
increasing 4.8 percent in the previous quarter, the ministry
said. From the previous quarter, outlays fell 0.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story: Yoshiaki Nohara in Tokyo
