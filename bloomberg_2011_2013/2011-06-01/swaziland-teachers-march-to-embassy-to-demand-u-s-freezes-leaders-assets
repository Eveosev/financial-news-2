Teachers in Swaziland, sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s last absolute monarchy, protested in the capital,
Mbabane, calling for the U.S. to freeze the assets of the
country’s top leaders, said Muzi Mhlanga, general secretary of a
teachers’ union.  About 1,000 teachers marched to the American embassy to
demand U.S. action amid a fiscal crisis in the southern African
nation, Mhlanga, of the Swaziland National Association of
Teachers, said in an interview in the capital today. The union
also wants  South Africa  to help bring democracy to Swaziland, he
said.  Swaziland, Africa’s third-largest sugar producer and
bordered by South Africa and Mozambique, is trying to contain a
 budget crisis  that has forced it to raise taxes and slash
spending. Labor unions have refused to agree to a planned state-
worker wage cut and led violent pro-democracy protests against
the government in April.  King Mswati III, who has 14 wives, has a personal fortune
of $200 million, according to Forbes Magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
