Vietnam ’s two-year bonds rose for a
second day on speculation new lending regulations are increasing
liquidity at banks, resulting in more demand for government debt.  Commercial banks must limit lending to “non-production
businesses,” such as those investing in the stock and property
markets, to 22 percent of total loans by June 30 and 16 percent
by year’s end, the  State Bank  of Vietnam said in a March 1
statement.  “Demand for the securities has increased because liquidity
at banks improved,” said Tran Thi Ngoc Thanh, the Ho Chi Minh
City-based deputy manager of the investment-banking division at
Sacombank Securities Joint-Stock Co. The supply of fixed-income
assets is also limited at the moment, she said.  Two-year yields fell 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage
point, to 12.56 percent, the lowest level since May 17,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,580 per dollar as of 2:58
p.m. in Hanoi, according to prices from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  Consumer prices rose 19.78 percent in May from a year
earlier, compared with 17.51 percent in April, according to data
released by the General Statistics Office in Hanoi May 24.
That’s the quickest pace since December 2008.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,638 today,
compared with 20,643 yesterday, its website showed. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the
official rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, David Yong  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
