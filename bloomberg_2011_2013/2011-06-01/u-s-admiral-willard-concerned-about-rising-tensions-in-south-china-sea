U.S. Navy Admiral Robert Willard said
he’s concerned about recent tensions involving  China  and its
neighbors in the  South China Sea  as he sought to ease concern
over the American military presence in the region.  Willard’s comments follow several incidents in the
resource-rich waters, which are claimed by multiple nations.
Vietnam last week protested to China, alleging that Chinese
ships cut survey cables of a vessel operated by Vietnam Oil &
Gas Group, or PetroVietnam.  “In 2010, the entire region became concerned about the
potential for clashes in the South China Sea,” Willard, the top
U.S. military commander in the Asia-Pacific region, told
reporters today in  Kuala Lumpur . “Yes, I am concerned anytime
that I see tensions arise, and confrontations take place, within
this very strategic and important area to all of us.”  China last week also rejected as “totally unreasonable” a
protest by  Vietnam  over reported plans by the parent of China
Mobile Ltd. to expand cellular phone coverage in disputed
islands in the South China Sea, known as the Spratlys.  The “United States doesn’t take side in a dispute,”
Willard said. “It’s strongly committed to see that the sides
within the dispute handle them peacefully and through dialogue
and not in confrontation at sea or in the air.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
