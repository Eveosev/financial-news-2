Japanese and Australian stock futures
fell after U.S. manufacturing expanded at the weakest pace in
more than a year and employers hired fewer workers than forecast,
fueling concern the global economic recovery will slow.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, sank 1.9 percent from the closing price in
Tokyo. Those of Honda Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more than
80 percent of its sales abroad, slid 1.8 percent. ADRs of  BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s No. 1 oil producer, slipped 1.5
percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,560 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 9,710
in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,560 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index lost 1.5 percent today.  “Manufacturing growth is slowing,” said  Mitsushige Akino ,
who oversees the equivalent of $600 million at Ichiyoshi
Investment Management Co. in  Tokyo . “The global economy has hit
a soft patch and more investors are shying away from risk
assets.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. In New York, the index retreated 2.3 percent yesterday,
its biggest decline since August, after the Institute for Supply
Management’s factory index fell to its lowest level since
September 2009.  U.S. Jobs  Companies in the U.S. last month added jobs at the slowest
pace since September. Employment grew by 38,000 last month, data
from ADP Employer Services showed yesterday, missing a 175,000
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yen gained against its most-traded counterparts as weak
data from the U.S. increased concern the global recovery is
slowing, boosting demand for haven assets.  The yen appreciated to as high as 80.68 against the dollar
last night in Tokyo, compared with 81.30 at the close of  stock
trading  yesterday. Against the euro,  Japan ’s currency
strengthened to 115.77 from 117.39. A stronger yen cuts the
value of overseas earnings for Japan’s exporters.  Crude oil for June delivery declined 2.4 percent to settle
at $100.29 a barrel in New York yesterday, the biggest drop in a
single-session since May 11. The London Metal Exchange Index of
prices for six metals including copper and aluminum lost 1
percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.5 percent by the S&P
500 and 0.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.8 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.3 times for the  S&P 500  and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
