A House panel rejected President
 Barack Obama ’s decision to abandon a planned nuclear-waste dump
in  Nevada  and slashed $5.9 billion from his budget request for
energy- and water-related programs.  Under a bill released today by the House Appropriations
Committee, the Yucca Mountain nuclear-waste repository would
receive $35 million in fiscal year 2012, according to a
statement on the committee’s  website . Obama last year rejected
plans for a permanent storage facility at Yucca Mountain and
ordered the Energy Department to study options for housing the
nation’s spent nuclear fuel.  The measure would also provide $30.6 billion for various
programs under the Energy Department, Interior Department, the
 Army Corps  of Engineers and four other independent agencies.
That’s $5.9 billion less than Obama had sought. The Energy and
Water subcommittee will consider the bill tomorrow.  “The bill rejects the Administration’s wasteful, partisan
attempts to shutter the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository
program,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
