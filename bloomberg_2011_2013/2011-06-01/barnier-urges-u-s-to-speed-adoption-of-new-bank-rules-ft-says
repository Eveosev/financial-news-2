Michel Barnier , the European Union’s
financial markets commissioner, said the U.S. must accelerate
its adoption of more stringent new banking rules so that “the

slogan,” the Financial Times reported, citing a May 27 letter
from Barnier to U.S. Treasury Secretary  Tim Geithner .  To contact the reporter on this story:
