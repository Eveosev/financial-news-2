(Corrects percentage of viewers in third paragraph.)  The  Miami Heat ’s 92-84 victory over
the Dallas Mavericks in the opening game of the National
Basketball Association Finals on ABC drew the highest Game 1
television ratings since 2004.  The victory by the heat, led by LeBron James,  Dwyane Wade 
and Chris Bosh, was seen in 10.7 percent of U.S. homes in the
top 56 metered television markets, ESPN said in a news release
citing Nielsen Media Research.  Those ratings are up from the 9.3 percent that watched the
same teams open their Finals series in 2006, and 10.4 percent
for the 2010 Finals Game 1 between the Los Angeles Lakers and
Boston Celtics, according to the release.  ESPN and ABC are units of the  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)   Game 1 of the 2004 Finals, between the Lakers and Detroit
Pistons, drew an 11.5 overnight rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
