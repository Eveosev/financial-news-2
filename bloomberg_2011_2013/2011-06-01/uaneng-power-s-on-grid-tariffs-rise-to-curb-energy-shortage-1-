Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011) , the
listed unit of China’s largest power producer, said on-grid
tariffs at its power plants have been increased as the
government aims to boost production and curb an energy shortage.  Tariffs for the company’s generation units, or paid by
grids, will rise 9.3 yuan ($1.4) per megawatt-hour this year,
according to a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  China increased retail power prices in 15 provinces from
today to curb demand and spur electricity generation as the
nation battles with a supply shortfall. China also boosted on-
grid power tariffs in the provinces of Hubei, Anhui and Jiangxi
from today while those for 12 other provinces were increased on
April 10,  China  Securities Journal said May 30.  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
