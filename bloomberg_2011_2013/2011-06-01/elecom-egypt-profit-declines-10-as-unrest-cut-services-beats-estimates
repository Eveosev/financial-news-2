Telecom Egypt (ETEL) , the Arab country’s
fixed-line telephone monopoly, said first-quarter profit
declined 10 percent after communications services were disrupted
by anti-government protests.  Net income fell to 892 million Egyptian pounds ($150
million) from 992 million pounds in a year earlier, the Cairo-
based company said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.
Telecom  Egypt  was forecast to report a profit of 752.6 million
pounds for the quarter, according to the average of five
analysts’ estimates on Bloomberg.  "Our revenues have been impacted by the  extenuating
circumstances in our domestic market; in particular the voice
revenues derived from business customers and the international
call revenues," Telecom Egypt’s Chairman Akil Beshir said in the
statement. "In spite of the unstable political and economic
environment our margins have remained robust and in line with
management’s original expectations."  Revenue dropped to 2.4 billion pounds from 2.5 billion
pounds. Telecom Egypt said in March it incurred 17.57 million
Egyptian pounds in damages, or 0.1 percent of its net fixed
assets, because of the unrest that resulted in the ouster of
 Hosni Mubarak  as president.  The shares dropped 2.8 percent to 15.54 pounds in Cairo
yesterday, giving the company a market value of 26.5 billion
pounds. The stock has declined 14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
