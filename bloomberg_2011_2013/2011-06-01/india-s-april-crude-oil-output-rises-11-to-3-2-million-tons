India ’s crude oil output rose for the
17th straight month in April as non-state companies including
 Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR)  boosted production.  Asia ’s second-biggest energy consumer pumped 3.2 million
metric tons of oil in April, an 11 percent increase from a year
earlier, the  oil ministry  said in a statement today.  Production by non-state explorers climbed 67 percent to
901,100 tons. Output from Rajasthan state, where Cairn India
operates the country’s biggest onshore oil deposit, surged
almost fourfold to 523,800 tons, according to the data. Cairn
India started output at the field in August 2009.  Output by state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the nation’s
largest energy explorer, fell 3.1 percent to 2 million tons from
a year earlier, according to the ministry.  ONGC’s Mumbai High fields produced 1.3 million tons, a
decline of 4.5 percent. The fields, 100 miles (160 kilometers)
northwest of Mumbai in the  Arabian Sea , account for about 41
percent of India’s oil production.  Oil India Ltd. (OINL) , the second-biggest state-run crude
producer, reported a 6 percent increase in output to 316,700
tons, according to the statement.  Natural gas output in India fell for the fifth straight
month, declining 9.3 percent to 4.1 billion cubic meters,
according to the data.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s biggest company by market
value, cut production from the country’s largest gas field,
located off the east coast, to 50 million cubic meters a day
from a maximum level of 60 million because of reduced pressure
in the reservoir, according to the country’s oil regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
