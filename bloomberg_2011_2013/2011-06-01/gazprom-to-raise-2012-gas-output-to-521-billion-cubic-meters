OAO Gazprom, the world’s largest
natural gas producer, plans to increase spending this year while
seeking to return output to the levels before the 2009 slump in
European demand.  Gazprom is raising its targets for 2011 after production in
the first five months of the year outpaced planned volumes,
Deputy Chief Executive Officer Alexander Ananenkov told
reporters in Moscow today. Output is forecast to rise about 2
percent to 519 billion cubic meters in 2011, compared with an
expected decline to 505.6 billion cubic meters, he said.  “There has been significant growth in demand in  Europe ,”
Ananenkov said. “We will reach the pre-crisis level by 2013.”  Gazprom, which supplies a quarter of Europe’s gas, has
benefited as  Japan ’s nuclear disaster and political unrest in
North Africa and the  Middle East  boosted prices and demand for
its fuel. Sales have been climbing at a faster pace this year
than last, Chief Executive Officer  Alexei Miller  said in April.  Output may climb to 549.2 billion cubic meters in 2013
year, almost the volume pumped in 2008, after the Kirinskoye
field near Sakhalin and Bovanenkovo on the Yamal peninsula in
the Arctic region come on line next year, Ananenkov said.  The company aims to increase production to 521 billion
cubic meters next year and 570 billion in 2014, he said.  Gazprom is starting to develop remote fields in harsh
climatic and geological conditions as its biggest fields in
western Siberia decline.  Investments this year may reach 1.18 trillion rubles ($42
billion), higher than initially planned, and remain at that
level for the next two years, Ananenkov said.  Gazprom’s board in November approved lower spending of
816.4 billion rubles for this year, less than in 2010, because
of slack demand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
