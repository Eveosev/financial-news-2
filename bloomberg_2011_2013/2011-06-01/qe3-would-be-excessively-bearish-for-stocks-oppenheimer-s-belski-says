Stocks would suffer after an initial
jump should the  Federal Reserve  decide to extend economic
stimulus beyond the June expiration of its current quantitative
easing program, Oppenheimer & Co.’s  Brian Belski  said.  “We become excessively bearish if the Fed goes to QE3,”
Belski said in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the
Loop” with Betty Liu. “We do not want to see QE3,” the New
York-based chief investment strategist said. “We think that
only prolongs the inevitable when the Fed has to eventually sell
these securities that they have been buying.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 7 percent in 2011
through yesterday amid higher-than estimated earnings and
government stimulus measures. Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and the
Federal Open Market Committee plan to complete a $600 billion
bond purchase program, known as quantitative easing or “QE2”
on  Wall Street  because it’s a second round, in June while
holding interest rates “exceptionally low” for an “extended
period,” according to a Fed statement last month.  “QE3 is a short-term event, which will cause the market to
go higher because investors over the last 10 years have become
so reliant on cheap money and low interest rates,” said Belski,
who recommends investors sell into any rally in stocks if QE3
occurs.  Belski estimates the S&P 500 will end 2011 at 1,325, with
companies in the index earning $90 a share. Belski’s estimate is
below the mean of forecasts compiled by Bloomberg as of May 31.
The average estimate of 13 strategists calls for the benchmark
measure to end 2011 at 1,402. He is forecasting the benchmark
gauge for U.S. stocks will end 2012 at 1,475 and that companies
will have a per-share profit of $103 for the year.  S&P 500   The S&P 500 fell 1.1 percent to 1,330.61 as of 12 p.m. in
 New York  today, snapping a four-day advance as manufacturing
expanded at the slowest pace in more than a year and employers
hired fewer workers than forecast.  “On a near-term basis, if we start to see negative
employment growth for a couple of months, that would not be
good,” Belski said. “It would shock the system and investors
would pour even more money into bonds.”  Employment increased by 38,000 last month, the smallest
rose since September, from a revised 177,000 in April, according
to figures from ADP Employer Services released today. The median
estimate in the Bloomberg News survey called for a 175,000
advance for May.  A separate report showed the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s factory index fell more than projected to 53.5 last
month, the lowest level since September 2009, from 60.4 in
April. Economists projected the gauge would drop to 57.1,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Charles Plosser   Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said last month that the U.S. economic recovery is
nearing a point where the central bank should begin pulling back
record stimulus and that a third round of quantitative easing,
or QE3, is unlikely. The Fed hasn’t set out a timeline for
shrinking its $2.7 trillion balance sheet or raising rates from
the zero-to-0.25 percent range that’s been in place since
December 2008.  “The inevitability, folks, is that the next longer-term
move in our collective careers is higher  interest rates ,”
Belski said. “So all of the short-term events going back into
bonds is just prolonging the inevitability of higher interest
rates and better economies and higher inflation.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
