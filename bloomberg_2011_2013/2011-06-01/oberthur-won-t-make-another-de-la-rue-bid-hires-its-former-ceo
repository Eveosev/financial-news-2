Francois-Charles Oberthur Fiduciaire
SA said it hired the former chief executive officer of  De La Rue
Plc (DLAR)  as an adviser and it doesn’t plan to make another bid for
the banknote printer after a previous overture failed.  James Hussey’s “detailed understanding of the market and
long-standing relationships across the industry will be
invaluable to Oberthur,” Chairman Jean Pierre Savare said in a
statement. “We want to clarify, without any reservation, that
we have no intention of making an offer for De La Rue.”  Oberthur abandoned a 10-week chase of the 200-year-old
Basingstoke, England-based company after De La Rue refused to
enter talks over a sweetened 926 million-pound ($1.5 billion)
offer in January. Hussey resigned in August after production
issues at a factory caused operations to be suspended. His
resignation stemmed from “his belief that he must take
responsibility for this,” the company said at the time.  De La Rue fell as much as 5.1 percent to 780.5 pence in
 London , the biggest intraday drop since Jan. 24. The stock
traded 3.3 percent lower at 795 pence as of 10:03 a.m., giving
the company a market value of 789 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
