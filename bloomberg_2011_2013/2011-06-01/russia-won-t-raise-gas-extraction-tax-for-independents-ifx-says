Russia  won’t raise the extraction tax
on natural gas for independent producers as it increases levies
on the industry in search of budget revenue, Finance Minister
Alexei Kudrin said today.  The tax burden on the industry will increase by 150 billion
rubles ($5.36 billion) next year, 170 billion in 2013 and 185
billion in 2014, Kudrin said at a meeting chaired by Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin today, according to a  statement  posted
on the government website. The mineral extraction tax will
account for up to 90 percent, he said.  Russia, the world’s biggest energy exporter, relies on oil
and gas revenue for its budget. The  finance ministry  is seeking
to double the mineral extraction tax on companies that own gas
pipelines to 536 rubles ($19) per 1,000 cubic meters next year,
Deputy Minister Sergei Shatalov said last week. OAO Gazprom owns
Russia’s main network, is the sole exporter of the fuel by law,
and is the country’s biggest tax payer.  “Mainly it will refer to Gazprom as an organization that
exports gas, as opposed to other independent gas producers,”
the statement cited Kudrin as saying. “The mineral extraction
tax won’t be increased for independent producers.”  OAO Novatek, Russia’s biggest independent gas producer,
rose as much as 1.4 percent to 369.78 rubles in Moscow today,
the highest level since May 11. Gazprom fell 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
