Fujifilm Holdings Corp. (4901) ,  Japan ’s
biggest maker of color copiers, fell the most in almost a month
in Tokyo trading after Moody’s Investors Service said it may
lower the company’s Aa3 credit rating.  Fujifilm dropped as much as 2.4 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since May 6, to 2,342 yen as of 10:08 a.m. on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average
fell 0.1 percent.  The copier-maker was among 15 Japanese issuers whose debt
assessments were placed under review for possible downgrades
yesterday by Moody’s after the ratings company said it may lower
Japan’s rating. The Aa3 rank is Moody’s fourth-highest
investment grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
