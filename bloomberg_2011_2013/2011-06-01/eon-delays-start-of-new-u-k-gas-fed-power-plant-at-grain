EON AG,  Germany ’s biggest utility, is
working to resolve “difficulties” delaying the commercial
start of its natural gas-fired power station at the Isle of
Grain in southeast  England .  The 1,275-megawatt plant’s three units have been testing
since October. The station was due to start feeding commercial
power deliveries to the grid by the end of March.  “Completion of the Grain combined cycle gas turbine units
has been delayed by technical difficulties during commissioning,
which we are working hard with our principal contractor to
resolve as soon as possible,” Scott Somerville, a Coventry,
England-based spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement today.
There is no precise date for the plant to start commercial
deliveries, he said.  Alstom SA, the world’s third-largest power-equipment maker,
said last month there were “technical issues” with generator
transformers at sites including Grain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
