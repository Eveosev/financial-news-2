Indian Oil Corp. and unit Chennai
Petroleum Corp. led refiners in boosting the country’s crude
processing in April for the fifth straight month.  The country’s refiners turned 14 million metric tons of
crude into fuels, 6.6 percent higher than a year earlier, the
oil ministry said in a statement in  New Delhi  today.  Processing by state-owned Indian Oil, the nation’s largest
refiner, rose 7.9 percent to 4.8 million tons after its plant at
Haldia in West Bengal state increased production by 32 percent.
Chennai Petroleum, based in the southern state of  Tamil Nadu ,
raised output 69 percent to 959,500 tons.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s biggest
refining complex, processed 2.9 million tons, a decrease of 2.3
percent. Smaller rival  Essar Oil Ltd. (ESOIL)  cut output 0.2 percent.
Reliance didn’t provide data for its newer, 29 million ton-a-
year refinery, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
