U.S. legislators have disengaged from
the fight against global warming, even as the administration of
 Barack Obama  remains committed to its emissions-reduction
target, according to the United Nations climate chief.  “It’s very evident that the legislative body in the U.S.
has disengaged,” Christiana Figueres, executive secretary for
the UN Convention on  Climate Change , told a news conference at
the Carbon Expo in Barcelona. “The administration continues to
stand by their 17 percent target.”  The so-called Green Climate Fund being created by UN envoys
to help developing nations cope with climate change should be
operating by 2020 “at the latest,” Figueres said. “Hopefully
before that.”  It may take years to put together the structure of the fund
and find the capital amounting to $100 billion a year, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
