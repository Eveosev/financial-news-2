The Australian government is
considering charging polluters a price of A$18 to A$23 a ton for
their carbon emissions, which would raise as much as A$10
billion a year, the Australian newspaper said, citing government
sources it didn’t identify. The starting carbon price in
 Australia  will be influenced by the price of the European
Union’s emissions trading system, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
