The dollar’s drop over the past week
suggests currency traders may be speculating that the  Federal
Reserve  will implement a third program of asset purchases, known
as quantitative easing, Citigroup Inc. said.  “The pace of dollar weakening during the past week is
noteworthy,”  Greg Anderson , a senior currency strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in New York, wrote in a research report today.
“It certainly supports the notion that foreign-exchange markets
are beginning to price in QE3.”  The Dollar Index has dropped 2 percent in the past week. It
was 0.2 percent lower as of 6:53 a.m. in London today, at
74.408.  To contact the reporter on this story:
