Iraq agreed to buy 132,000 metric
tons of rice from  Thailand  and the U.S., the country’s grain
board said in an e-mailed statement today.  The grain was bought from Louis Dreyfus and Ameropa,
according to the statement. The original tender was for 30,000
tons and the bidding deadline was May 29.  “Iraq consumes as much as 1.2 million tons of rice per
year, most of which has to be imported because of the lack of
local production mostly due to a shortage of water,” the
board said. The country produces about 70,000 tons of rice a
year, it said.  Surging food costs and rising unemployment have helped spur
protests in the region, toppling leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt 
this year. Iraq produces about half of the grain it consumes and
is seeking foreign investment in agriculture to help meet a
target to be self-sufficient within three years, Agriculture
Minister Ezzeddin al-Dawla said March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
