Iceland doesn’t need to draw on a
$4.6 billion bailout loan led by the  International Monetary Fund 
following the lender’s fifth review of the country’s economic
program, according to the island nation’s central bank.  The bank expects the review to be completed on June 3
“after which the loan can be paid out,” Governor Mar
Gudmundsson told state broadcaster RUV. “However, now the
situation is that we have a lot of available foreign exchange in
cash” and “we’re not in any desperate need for loans at the
moment,” he said, adding that “we’re not in any hurry” to
draw on the facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
