The cost of insuring corporate debt
fell in  Europe , according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of swaps on 40 companies
with mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 3 basis points to
367, and the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade
companies fell 1 to 101.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. A
decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased 2 basis points to 154.5 and the
subordinated index was 3 lower at 256.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell 2.5 basis points to 194.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.4 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
