The judge overseeing the case of
Vallejo,  California , the biggest U.S. city in bankruptcy, set a
hearing for July 28 on whether to confirm its plan for financial
reorganization.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Michael S. McManus in  Sacramento ,
California, scheduled the hearing in a routine order yesterday,
five days after he approved a disclosure statement for the plan.
McManus will take creditors’ votes on that plan into account
when he decides whether to approve the proposal.  The city during the bankruptcy cut labor costs by firing
employees, renegotiated union contracts and reduced what it pays
to subsidize retirees’ health care.  Vallejo, a onetime U.S. Navy town of about 120,000 on San
Francisco Bay, sought protection from creditors in May 2008
under Chapter 9 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code  after the recession
eroded tax revenue and unions rejected wage cuts. Chapter 9
allows municipalities to reorganize debt.  The plan doesn’t alter securities tied to designated
revenue sources, such as about $175 million in water revenue
bonds, and other special tax obligations secured by special
revenue of the city’s restricted funds, according to the
documents.  The case is In re City of Vallejo, 08-26813,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Eastern District of California (Sacramento).  To contact the reporter on this story:
