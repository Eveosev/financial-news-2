The  Southern African Development
Community  invited 11 political parties in Madagascar to a summit
in Botswana to discuss the political crisis in the country, the
regional group said.  SADC will host talks starting on June 6 in Gaborone,
Botswanaâ€™s capital, on its proposal to end the crisis in the
country, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  The three main opposition groups refused to sign the
roadmap that proposed leaving Andry Rajoelina as president of an
interim administration in Madagascar until elections. Rajoelina
ousted  Marc Ravalomanana  is 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
