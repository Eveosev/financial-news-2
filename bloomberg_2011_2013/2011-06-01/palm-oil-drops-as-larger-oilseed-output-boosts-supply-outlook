Palm oil  declined to the lowest level
in a week on speculation that output from  Malaysia , the second-
largest producer, may have expanded as much as 20 percent in
May, and on expectations that global oilseed output will grow.  August-delivery palm oil declined 1 percent to 3,358
ringgit ($1,117) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the lowest level at close since May 23.  World oilseed production will rise 1.7 percent in the year
through September as improved crops in  Brazil  boost global
output, Oil World said in a report yesterday. Malaysia’s palm
oil production in April expanded 8 percent to 1.53 million tons
from March, the nation’s palm oil board said on May 10. It will
report May data on June 10.  “Initial indications show around a 20 percent gain in May
production,” Vijay Mehta, director at Commodity Links Pte, said
by phone from  Singapore  today. “If it is true, this will not
allow palm prices to go up too high.”  Production of seven oilseeds may total 441.2 million tons,
up 7.7 million tons from last year and 2.9 million tons more
than an estimate last month, Oil World said. The soybean crop in
Brazil will total 73 million tons, up 6.3 percent from a year
earlier, according to the report.  “Exports were not that great,” Sandeep Bajoria, chief
executive officer at brokerage Sunvin Group, said by phone from
Mumbai. “That’s the reason the market is shedding some gains,
so that it becomes more competitive.”  ‘High Difference’  Malaysia’s palm oil exports rose 2.5 percent to 1.35
million tons in May compared with the previous month,
independent cargo surveyor  Societe Generale  de Surveillance said
yesterday. That was less than the 16.5 percent growth in the
first 25 days of May, and 28 percent in the first 20 days,
according to the surveyor.  Losses in palm oil futures may be limited because palm oil
is supported by gains in soybeans and demand is expected to pick
up, Mehta said.  “Because of the high difference, not many consumers are
really chasing  soybean oil  at this level,” he said, referring
to the oil’s premium over palm oil.  Soybean oil’s premium widened to $172.16 a ton today, the
highest in two weeks, compared with the average of $111.16 this
year. Soybean oil for July delivery climbed as much as 0.6
percent to 58.84 cents a pound.  January-delivery palm oil on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
fell 0.3 percent to close at 9,262 yuan ($1,430) a ton. Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month dropped 0.3 percent to 10,302
yuan a ton at the close.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active September palm-oil contract,
pegged to the Malaysian benchmark, dropped 0.7 percent to
$1,111.25 per ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
