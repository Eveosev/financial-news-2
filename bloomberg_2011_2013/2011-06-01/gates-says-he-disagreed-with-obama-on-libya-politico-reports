U.S. Defense Secretary  Robert Gates 
said his biggest disagreement with President Barack Obama was
over the decision to intervene in  Libya , according to an
interview with Politico.  “Once in 2 1/2 years isn’t bad,” Gates said. “No
president is well-served by groupthink, or by everybody singing
from the same sheet of music they think he’s on.”  Obama “told the military leadership early on: He said,
’The only thing I’ll ever blame you for -- or get mad at you --
is if you had a different view and you didn’t tell me.’” Gates
said in the interview, which occurred while he was en route to
 Asia  for an international security conference.  Gates, 67, is retiring after serving as defense secretary
first for President  George W. Bush  and then for Obama. Gates
previously served as director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, and Obama has nominated current CIA director Leon Panetta to succeed Gates at the Pentagon.  “One of the reasons it’s probably time for me to leave is
that sometimes too much experience can get in the way, and you
can get too cautious,” said Gates, who first entered government
service in 1966. It may “be making me more cautious that I
ought to be.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
