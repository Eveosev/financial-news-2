The premium for Syncrude strengthened
after  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  scrapped plans for a mid-
June partial restart at its Horizon oil sands upgrader because
of forest fires.  All four coke drums at Horizon will now be started together
in August, the Calgary-based company said yesterday in a
statement. The plant near Fort McMurray,  Alberta , should reach
full production within two to three weeks of startup.  The premium for Syncrude rose 50 cents to $9 a barrel above
benchmark West Texas Intermediate at 12:09 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Syncrude is a light,
low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in Alberta.
The discount for Western Canada Select widened $1.25 to $19 a
barrel.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium strengthened 20 cents to
$15.75. Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost 10 cents to $15.40 a barrel
over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend decreased 10 cents to $9.60 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium widened 10 cents to $9.35.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained 25 cents to $14.70 a barrel.
Southern Green Canyon’s slipped 20 cents to $8.80.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount narrowed 25 cents to $1.90 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
