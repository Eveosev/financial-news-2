MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, is weighing additional acquisitions outside its home
nation after paying more than $16 billion to buy a unit from
American International Group Inc. to expand in  Japan .  “We do see opportunities that would be considered either
tuck-ins or bolt-ons because of our international size and
scope,” Chairman Robert Henrikson said today at a conference in
 New York , where MetLife is based.  To contact the reporter on this story:
