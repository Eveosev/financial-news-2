Asian currencies strengthened, led by
 Taiwan ’s dollar, on speculation the world’s fastest economic
growth will attract funds and regional policy makers will raise
interest rates further to curb inflation.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan  Asia  Dollar Index rose for a fifth
day after foreign investors bought $927 million more Taiwanese
and South Korean stocks than they sold yesterday. Manufacturing
growth in  China  eased less than analysts forecast in May and
consumer-price gains in South Korea exceeded the central bank’s
target for a fifth month, reports showed today. Thailand will
raise borrowing costs today, according to all 16 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Taiwan’s dollar climbed 0.7 percent to NT$28.583 as of
11:32 a.m. local time, according to Taipei Forex Inc.  South
Korea ’s won gained 0.3 percent to 1,076.25, Singapore’s dollar
strengthened 0.2 percent to S$1.2309 and the Malaysian ringgit
added 0.1 percent to 3.0085.  “Inflation risks in Asia are rising and regional central
banks will continue to boost interest rates, supporting the
currencies,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian
and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo .  Asia’s developing economies will expand 8.4 percent this
year, outpacing growth of 2.8 percent in the U.S. and 1.6
percent in the euro area, according to International Monetary
Fund forecasts published in April.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks gained for a second
day on optimism  Europe ’s debt crisis may be easing. The European
Union, the  International Monetary Fund  and the  European Central
Bank  are reviewing Greece’s progress in meeting the terms of
last year’s 110 billion-euro ($159 billion) bailout in the next
few days, before working out a new financial package.  Taiwanese Inflation  Taiwanese consumer prices rose 1.6 percent in May from a
year earlier, the most since February 2010, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before data
due June 7. The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate
by 12.5 basis points to 1.75 percent in March. It will review
borrowing costs again on June 30, Hsu Mu-liang, director-general
at the secretariat at the Central Bank of the Republic of China,
said today.  “Inflation problems persist and the market is expecting
the central bank to raise interest rates again this month,”
said Ivy Leung, a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at Polaris
Securities Co.  Consumer prices in  Thailand  rose 4.3 percent from a year
earlier in May, the most since September 2008, a Bloomberg
survey showed before a government report today. The Bank of
Thailand will lift the one-day bond repurchase rate by a quarter
of a percentage point to 3 percent, according to a separate poll.
The baht rose 0.1 percent to 30.29 per dollar.  China Outlook  The yuan was little changed at 6.4782 per dollar, after
reaching a 17-year high of 6.4780 yesterday. Twelve-month non-
deliverable forwards gained 0.06 percent to 6.3565, a 1.9
percent premium to the onshore spot rate.  China’s PMI Manufacturing Index eased to 52, from 52.9 in
April, according to the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics and the Federation of Logistics and Purchasing.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a reading of 51.6.  “Today’s PMI data came a bit stronger than expected but
still quite soft,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a foreign-exchange
strategist in  Singapore  at Westpac Banking Corp. “The pace of
renminbi rises may slow as the economy cools.”  The People’s Bank of China may increase the yuan’s trading
band, interest rates and banks’ reserve requirement ratios this
month to curb inflation, the Shanghai Securities News reported
today, citing unidentified market participants.  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 8,539
per dollar, the Philippine peso rose 0.2 percent to 43.202 and
the Indian rupee strengthened 0.2 percent to 44.9825.  To contact the reporter on this story:
