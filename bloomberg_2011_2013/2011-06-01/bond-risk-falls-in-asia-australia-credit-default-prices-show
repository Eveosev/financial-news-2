The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in Asia and  Australia  against non-payment fell,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 0.5 of a basis point to 107
basis points as of 8:30 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc. prices. The Markit iTraxx Australia
index also fell 0.5 of a basis point, to 107.5, as of 10:28 a.m.
in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 125.5
basis points as of 9:34 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
