Financial markets react more to
negative sovereign credit rating announcements than positive
ones, according to a European Central Bank research paper.  Analysis showed a negative rating event increases sovereign
bond-yield spreads by 0.08 percentage point and credit-default
swaps by 13 basis points from the day before the announcement to
the day after, Antonio Afonso, Davide Furceri and Pedro Gomes
wrote in a study published on the ECB’s  website  today. A
positive event reduces yield spreads by 0.007 percentage point
and default swaps by 0.9 basis point, they said.  The economists looked at changes after rating actions from
 Standard & Poor’s , Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings
in 24 European Union members between January 1995 and October
2010. The data suggest credit rating and outlook announcements
are not anticipated in the preceding one or two months and that
most of the reaction in yields spreads happens during the second
day of the two-day period, the economist said. The reaction in
CDS spreads mostly occurs during the first day,  the study  found.  “While there is a significant reaction of sovereign-yield
spreads and particularly CDS spreads to negative events, the
reaction to positive events is much more muted,” the economists
said. “The fact that negative rating events take markets mostly
by surprise can either imply that fundamentals are not fully
discounted on a more permanent basis by market participants or
that rating events have, to some extent, gone astray of such
underpinnings in some events.”  The data suggest that while bond-yield spreads
“significantly” respond to negative S&P announcements, CDS
spreads increase following negative Moody’s and Fitch
announcements and decrease when positive S&P announcements
occur, the study found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
