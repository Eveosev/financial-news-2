k.d. lang is bringing her new band to
Britain. The singer-songwriter is backed by Siss Boom Bang on a
new Nashville album: her first in three years, and the first to
be made entirely with a group in two decades.  Lang’s Royal Festival Hall dates will showcase her clear-
voiced style -- a blend of country, jazz and pop -- and feature
tracks from “ Sing It Loud ,” her new Nonesuch Records CD.  Southbank Centre, Belvedere Road, SE1 8XX, tonight and
tomorrow. Information: +44-20-7960-4200,  http://www.kdlang.com/ ,
 http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/   The  Park Plaza  hotel, a 10-minute walk away, has a fine
restaurant that deserves more attention. Brasserie Joel is the
domain of Joel Antunes, who once wowed diners at Les Saveurs in
Mayfair and returns to London from the Oak Room at the Plaza
Hotel,  New York . Information:  http://www.brasseriejoel.co.uk/ 
and +44-20-7620-7272.  Saturday  Experience the great outdoors by staying inside at the
Haunch of Venison Gallery.  Richard Long is an artist who maps his long rambles through
nature with words and photographs. He uses mud, clay and wood.
His Danish river stones cover the waxed parquet of the gallery
behind the  Royal Academy of Arts .  Showing alongside him is Giuseppe Penone. In a niche
halfway up the stairs is a baby tree that Penone has sculpted
out of a log -- reversing the process that originally led the
log to be carved out of a tree. These are simple souls with
simple ideas that have a certain small charm.  The Haunch of Venison Gallery is at 6 Burlington Gardens,
London W1S 3ET. Information:  http://www.haunchofvenison.com  or
+44-20-7495-5050.  The  Royal Academy  now has a first-class restaurant in
Peyton & Byrne. Chef Mark Hollyer uses ingredients from
specialist producers for dishes such as ham hock salad and pea &
broad bean risotto. The wine list features special-edition
labels designed by academicians including Tracey Emin and Gary
Hume. Information:  http://bit.ly/dLU6BG  and +44-20-7300-5608.  Saturday Night  Watch an upper-crust East Coast couple come undone as a
pair of friends move in.  Agnes and Tobias live comfortably in their plush, carpet-
lined interior. They’re the main characters in Edward Albee’s
1966 play “A Delicate Balance.” One day, they receive an
alarmed visit from Harry and Edna, who are running scared -- but
won’t say what of.  The acting (by Imelda Staunton, among others) and directing
are fine, though at three hours with two intervals, it’s a long
evening.  “A Delicate Balance” is at the Almeida Theatre through
July 2. Information:  http://www.almeida.co.uk  or
+44-20-7359-4404.  Sunday  A dress made of candy sounds like something for Lady Gaga.  It’s actually a garment you learn to stitch together at the
 London  Green Fair, a free ecology jamboree in Regent’s Park.
Also in the recycled-couture section: a Swap Shop where you can
trade your little-worn T-shirt with someone else’s.  The fair has concerts, talks, a kids’ corner, and organic
food -- and is powered by renewable energy.  The London Green Fair runs from noon to 7:30 p.m. in
Regent’s Park Saturday and Sunday. Information:
 http://www.londongreenfair.org  or +44-20-7324-4693.  (Farah Nayeri and Mark Beech write for Muse, the arts and
