“Don’t be shy! Anyone can join!
Bring the whole family!” says a text balloon above Robert
Crumb’s 1969 comic book depiction of an “intercontinental orgy-
riot.”  At once coarse and funny, the sea of bodies was from an
underground magazine called Zap.  “Zap: Masters of Psychedelic Art 1965-74” at  Andrew Edlin
Gallery  is one of several amusing exhibitions within a few
blocks’ walk of one another in Chelsea.  There are artists from  Israel ,  Russia  and  China ,  Donald Judd ’s understated mix of poetry and Minimalism at  David Zwirner 
and Joseph Marioni’s sensual monochrome canvases at  Paul
Rodgers/9W .  Created by a group of subversive San Francisco artists --
Crumb, Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, Spain Rodriguez, Gilbert
Shelton, Robert Williams and S. Clay Wilson -- Zap was manic,
militant and fearless. You’ll see dismemberment, drug
consumption and many other kinds of bad behavior.  Coupled with deft execution and racy writing, the works
offer a glimpse of a deliriously noncommercial, nonconformist
art scene.  As its master craftsman, Crumb has gone on to mainstream
recognition and acceptance, such as 2009’s graphic “Book of
Genesis.” His illustrations from another brush with serious
literature can be seen at  Tony Shafrazi Gallery  in “R. Crumb:
Kafka” through July 30.  Most works in the “Zap” show are from a private California
collection. Several are available for prices ranging from
$15,000 to $40,000. The show runs through June 25 at 134 Tenth
Ave.; +1-212-206-9723;  http://www.edlingallery.com   Thomas, the Dump Truck  A block north, Chinese artist Cao Fei’s fourth solo show
with  Lombard Freid Projects  trades the virtual reality of her
previous series for familiar play symbols:  Thomas the Tank
Engine ,  CBeebies , hand shadows and a finger-skateboard park.  Titled “Play Time,” it includes a video “East West,” in
which a blue dump truck with Thomas’s face on the front bumper
delivers refuse from a construction site on one side of Beijing
to a trash dump across town.  The 10-minute film shows the mundane side of the country’s
rapid expansion: cranes mounting to the horizon, cheap food
joints, rude policemen, excited children and lots of bicycles.
The incongruous presence of Thomas adds tenderness and
playfulness to these bleak settings, seamlessly connecting the
East and the West.  The work is 28,000 euros ($40,000). Other pieces range from
13,000 euros to 84,000 euros. The show runs through June 25 at
518 West 19th St.; +1-212-967-8040;  http://www.lombard-freid.com   Naked Kate  Glamour takes over with photographs of  Kate Moss  at
 Danziger Projects .  “For someone who smokes and drinks as much as she does,
she has aged extremely well,” said James Danziger who recently
moved into the former quarters of Perry Rubenstein gallery on
West 23rd Street.  The highlight is a portfolio of 11 works by 11
photographers, including  Annie Leibovitz , Mario Testino and
 Bruce Weber . The supermodel is depicted blowing bubbles, wearing
a white furry coat, pulling up her dress, and showing off her
waifish figure in the buff.  The earliest pictures by Gene Lemuel are from 1988, the
year Moss was discovered at the age of 14, where she looks more
like a baby than a babe. Herb Ritts depicted Moss hugging a
Great Dane. Chuck Close focused on her toned and suntanned naked
torso, leaving the head out of the frame.  The portfolio costs $100,000 and comes in an edition of 30.
There are also individual images that range from $2,500 to
$15,000. “The Kate Moss Portfolio and Other Stories” runs
through June 30 at 527 W. 23rd St.; +1-212-629-6778;
