Ericsson AB and Silcar, a venture
between Siemens AG and  Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) , won A$1.5 billion
($1.6 billion) of construction contracts for  Australia ’s
national broadband network.  Ericsson, the world’s largest maker of mobile-phone
networks, won a A$1.1 billion order to build and operate high-
speed wireless services in rural areas, NBN Co., the government-
owned builder of the network, said in an e-mailed statement
today. Silcar won a A$380 million, two-year contract for fiber
construction in two states and the Australian Capital Territory.  The orders are the first announced since the A$36 billion
NBN project suspended tenders two months ago, citing proposed
construction costs that were too high. NBN said it negotiated
lower prices with Silcar by agreeing to take on more of the
risks in the project.  “We have every reason to believe we will bring in the
remaining locations across Australia at acceptable prices and on
very competitive terms,”  Kevin Brown , NBN’s head of corporate
services, said in the statement. “Discussions have already
commenced with a select group of construction companies for all
other regions in Australia.”  The plan to connect all Australians to high-speed Internet
is the nation’s biggest infrastructure project on record.  About 93 percent of the population will be served by fiber
while the rest will use satellite and wireless facilities such
as those being built by Ericsson.  To contact the reporter on this story:
