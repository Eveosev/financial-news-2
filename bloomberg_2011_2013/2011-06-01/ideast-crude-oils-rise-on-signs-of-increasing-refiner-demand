Middle East oil for sale to  Asia 
climbed on signs that refiner demand is climbing amid a surge in
consumer fuel buying.  Oman crude for immediate loading increased 52 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $110.41 barrel, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai oil for loading in July rose 0.5 percent to
$109.93.  Abu Dhabi ’s light Murban grade climbed 0.5 percent to
$114.85.  Indian refiners processed 6.6 percent more crude in April
than a year earlier, turning 14 million metric tons, or about
3.4 million barrels a day, into fuel, according to the country’s
oil ministry.  South Korea , Asia’s fourth-largest oil buyer,
boosted imports by 4.1 percent in May versus the earlier year
period, the government said today.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of refinery
profitability, climbed for a second day to $19.31 a barrel, the
highest since May 5, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a London-based brokerage.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for July widened 12
cents to $6.60 a barrel, PVM said. The exchange for swaps for
August increased 9 cents to $6.42 a barrel.  Oman futures for July delivery fell 16 cents to $110.55 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:41 p.m. Singapore
time, with 984 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$110.47 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
