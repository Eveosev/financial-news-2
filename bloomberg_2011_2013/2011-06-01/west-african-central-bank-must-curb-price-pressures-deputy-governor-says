The  Central Bank  of West African
States must ensure it curbs price pressures to help sustain
economic growth in the region, Vice Governor Jean-Baptiste
Compaore said.  “Each person in the central bank must play their role so
that there would be as little inflation as possible,” Compaore
told reporters in Dakar, Senegal as he headed into a Monetary
Policy Committee meeting to set  interest rates  for the region.  Ivory Coast is the “economic engine” of the region and
its recovery will determine the growth outlook in West Africa,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
