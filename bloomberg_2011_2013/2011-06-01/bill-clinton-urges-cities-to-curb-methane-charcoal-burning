Former U.S. President  Bill Clinton 
urged cities and the World Bank to work on restraining methane
emissions and the burning of charcoal, saying those steps would
buy time in the fight against global warming.  Clinton, speaking in Sao Paulo as World Bank President
Robert Zoellick agred to streamline the process cities use to
tap aid and expertise from the institution, said curbing methane
from landfills and charcoal in home cooking would be cheaper and
easier than limiting carbon dioxide from  power plants .  “The financing has not been available for these things
because they have been looked at as eyesores, not goldmines,”
Clinton said at the C40 mayors meeting today. “World Bank
financing may give us the chance to do something historic.”  The  World Bank  agreement with the C40 will give cities
“one window” access to provide technical expertise for
building capacity for climate programs and to get a sense what
funding is available to help, Zoellick said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
