Flint Hills Resources LLC reported
excess opacity from a superheater stack associated with a light
olefins unit at its plant in  Port Arthur ,  Texas , according to a
filing with state regulators.  During a furnace startup, the company switched a
cyclohexane unit back to light olefins unit hydrogen, which
caused a sudden high volume of vapors to push residual liquid
into the superheaterâ€™s fuel system, the Wichita, Kansas-based
company said in the  filing  with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality.  The liquid in turn caused the superheater to smoke, Flint
Hills said.  Katie Stavinoha, a company spokeswoman, did not immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. Flint Hills is a
subsidiary of Koch Industries Inc.  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  To contact the reporter on this story:
