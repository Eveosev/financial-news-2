Fifty-nine percent of Japanese adults
worry that they or a family member have been contaminated by
radiation from a nuclear reactor meltdown triggered by a March
11 earthquake and tsunami, the worst nuclear accident since
Chernobyl,  a survey found .  The Pew Research Center, based in Washington D.C., surveyed
700 Japanese adults between April 8 and April 27 about their
concerns about the economy, health, and nuclear safety. None
favored increasing  Japan ’s reliance on nuclear energy, 46
percent favored maintaining it and 44 said nuclear power should
play a smaller role, according to the  report , posted today on
Pew’s  website .  About 52 percent of those surveyed expect economic
conditions to worsen over the next 12 months, up from 33 percent
among those polled a year earlier, the center said. About 58
percent said Japan will emerge a stronger nation from the
disasters.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., owner of the leaking Dai-Ichi
nuclear power plant in Fukushima prefecture, drew the harshest
criticism with 86 percent of respondents judging its response to
the crisis poor. Almost 80 percent said the national government
of Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  responded poorly. The criticism
didn’t extend to the National Defense Force, as 95 judged its
response favorably.  Editors: Charles Siler, Susan Warren  To contact the reporter on this story:
