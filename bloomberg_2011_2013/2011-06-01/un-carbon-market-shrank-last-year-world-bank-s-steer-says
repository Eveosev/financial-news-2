The United Nations emissions market
shrank last year, even as nations began preparing for dramatic
fallout from  climate change , according to the World Bank’s
special envoy on global warming.  “There’s much to be gloomy about,” the World Bank’s
Andrew Steer told delegates at the Carbon Expo in Barcelona,
citing a spate of thefts of emissions allowances in the European
Union emissions market.  The world may need to prepare for temperature increases of
4 degrees Celsius (7.7 Fahrenheit), and the U.S. Navy is 
preparing for a 1.3-meter (5-foot) rise in sea levels,
Steer says.  Credits for protecting forests will increasingly enter
global carbon markets, Steer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
