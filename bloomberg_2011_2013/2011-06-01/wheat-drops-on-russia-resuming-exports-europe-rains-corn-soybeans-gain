Wheat futures fell to a two-week low
as  Russia  prepared to lift an export ban next month and rains
expected this week in  Europe  eased drought concerns. Corn and
soybeans rose.  Russia, once the world’s second-biggest wheat exporter,
will allow shipments starting on July 1. The ban was imposed in
August after drought slashed crops. This year,  France , Europe’s
top grower, is suffering from the driest spring in 50 years,
forecaster France Meteo said. Showers were expected this weekend
after rain helped crops in  Germany , Telvent DTN said.  “Russia opening the door for some exports was overhanging
the market, but then we had the news about good rain in
Europe,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc.
in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa . “The change in the forecast to wetter
paces the market, along with the Russian selling potential.”  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 23 cents, or 2.9
percent, to settle at $7.5925 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, bringing the two-day slide to 7.4
percent. Earlier, the price touched $7.5425, the lowest for a
most-active contract since May 17.  Futures have jumped 68 percent in the past year after
Russia cut exports and adverse weather limited output from the
U.S. Great Plains to  Australia .  Corn futures for July delivery rose 11 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $7.585 a bushel. The commodity has more than doubled
in the past year on rising demand from makers of ethanol and
livestock feed, while wet weather slowed U.S. planting.  Acreage, Yield Concerns  About 86 percent of the crop was  planted  as of May 29,
behind the five-year average of 95 percent, the government said
yesterday. Sixty-three percent of crops were in good or
excellent condition, below the year-earlier rating of 76
percent. Farmers in the eastern Midwest, where rains were the
most excessive, may take insurance instead of planting, Roose
said.  “We’ve got concerns about both acreage and yield,” he
said. “We still have almost 13 million acres of corn to plant,
and we’re zeroing in on those prevented-planting dates in
Indiana and  Ohio .”  Soybean futures for July delivery climbed 10.25 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $13.8625 a bushel. The price has gained 49
percent in the past year.  U.S. planting was 51 percent complete as of May 29, behind
the five-year average of 71 percent, the Department of
Agriculture said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. Wheat was fourth at $13 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
