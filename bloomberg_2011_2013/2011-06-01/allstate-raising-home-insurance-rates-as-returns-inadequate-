Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. home insurer, is increasing prices for residential
coverage after results missed the company’s targets.  “Overall returns have been inadequate” in the homeowners’
segment, the Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer said today in a
presentation for its Investor Day.  Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Wilson  needs to cushion
losses from natural disasters, including April tornadoes in
Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and  Virginia . Catastrophes cost the
firm $1.4 billion that month, the insurer said on May 12.  Allstate “significantly reduced” the potential for losses
on earthquakes and hurricanes by curtailing the sale of
homeowners’ policies in the most vulnerable regions and buying
reinsurance, the firm said.  Allstate slipped 1.6 percent this year through yesterday on
the New York Stock Exchange, compared with the 0.6 percent gain
of the 24-company KBW Insurance Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
