Fiat SpA (F) , the Italian carmaker that
runs Chrysler Group LLC, will sign a deal with  China  for its
powertrain division to build gearboxes in the country, three
people with direct knowledge of the plan said.  Fiat will announce the agreement June 3 in Rome, during a
visit by China’s Vice President Xi Jinping, said the people, who
declined to be named before an official statement.  Italy’s Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will meet Xi
Friday as part of the Chinese official’s visits to Italy, Cuba,
Uruguay and Chile. Fiat Chairman John Elkann will meet Xi at a
dinner with businesspeople in Milan Friday evening, one person
said. A spokesman for the carmaker declined to comment.  Fiat, which owns 46 percent of  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based
Chrysler, is targeting fast-growing economies to counter losses
in  Europe , its biggest market. The Turin-based carmaker already
gets most of its profit from Brazil and is also seeking to
expand in Russia.  The carmaker will enter the Chinese market next year with a
sedan model. Fiat is in the process of building its first car
plant there in a joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group
Co. Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne plans also to
introduce Jeep and Alfa brands in the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
