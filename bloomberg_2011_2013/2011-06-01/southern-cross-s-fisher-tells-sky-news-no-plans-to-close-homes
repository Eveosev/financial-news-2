Southern Cross  Healthcare Plc
Chairman Christopher Fisher told Sky News in an interview the
company, which runs 750 care homes and looks after a total of
31,000 elderly people in the U.K., has “no plans to close any
homes” and is “determined” the homes will stay open.  While Southern Cross doesn’t have “a pressing need” for
new capital, there is a need for costs to be stabilized, Fisher
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
