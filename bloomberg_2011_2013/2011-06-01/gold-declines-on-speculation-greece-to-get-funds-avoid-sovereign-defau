Gold may decline for a second day in
 New York  as speculation that  Greece ’s debt crisis is closer to
being resolved curbs demand for the metal as a protection of
wealth.  Greece’s next aid package may include incentives for
bondholders to roll over maturing debt without triggering a
credit-rating downgrade that would roil Europe’s banking system,
two people with knowledge of the talks said. The dollar was
little changed against six major currencies after dropping to a
three-week low. Bullion typically moves inversely to the
greenback.  “Seeming progress in negotiations over a new aid package
for Greece keeps gold trapped below $1,540” an ounce,  Edel Tully , a London-based analyst at UBS AG in London, said today in
a report. “Dollar weakness and Moody’s having put  Japan ’s
sovereign rating on review for a possible downgrade underpins
gold.”  Gold for August delivery fell $2.40, or 0.2 percent, to
$1,534.40 an ounce by 8 a.m. on the Comex in New York. The metal
yesterday reached $1,541.90, the highest level since May 4, and
ended the month down 1.3 percent. Immediate-delivery gold was
0.1 percent lower at $1,533.50 in London.  Bullion fell to $1,532.25 an ounce in the morning
“fixing” in London, used by some mining companies to sell
output, from $1,536.50 at yesterday’s afternoon fixing.  Gold’s Record  Concern about faster inflation, Europe’s debt crisis, a
weakening dollar and fighting in  Libya  boosted gold futures to a
record $1,577.40 on May 2. Prices are up 7.9 percent in 2011
after climbing the past 10 years, the longest run of gains in at
least nine decades in London. Japan’s debt rating was put on
review for a downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service yesterday.  Saddled with  Europe ’s heaviest debt load, Greece is seeking
additional loans after last year’s 110 billion-euro ($158
billion) European-led package was insufficient to plug its
fiscal hole. Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said
May 30 that the euro region’s leaders will decide on a new aid
package by the end of June and have ruled out a “total
restructuring” of Greece’s debt.  “Some investors are emboldened by signs that Greece will
get a bailout and avoid default, and are selling their gold,”
said Hwang Il Doo, a Seoul-based senior trader at KEB Futures
Co. “Minor losses are inevitable for gold to extend its bull
run.”  Silver for July delivery fell 0.7 percent to $38.045 an
ounce in New York. Prices dropped 21 percent in May, the most
since August 2008, as  CME Group Inc. (CME) , the Comex owner, raised
margin costs to curb price volatility.  The  U.S. Mint  sold 3.65 million ounces of American Eagle
silver coins last month, up 30 percent from April, its website
shows, taking the total for the year so far to 18.9 million
ounces. That compares with 15.2 million ounces in the first five
months of last year and is the best January through May period
since at least 1986, according to data going back to that year.
American Eagle gold coin sales fell 0.9 percent to 107,000
ounces last month.  Palladium for September delivery was little changed at
$781.50 an ounce. Platinum for July delivery was 0.2 percent
lower at $1,830.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
