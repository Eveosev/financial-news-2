Following is the text of U.S.
online help wanted advertising from the Conference Board.  Online Labor Demand Rises 148,800 in May
Labor demand rises in May to pre-recession monthly high of 4.5 million advertised
vacancies
Labor demand up an average of 66,000/month over the last 4 months
May marks an all-time high for 6 of 22 major occupation groups since the HWOL series
began in May 2005  Online advertised vacancies were up 148,800 in May to 4,471,200 according to
The Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine Data Series released today. The May increase
follows a decline of 124,000 in April and a gain of 198,000 in March.  “Overall, the trend in online advertised vacancies has been positive this year,”
said June Shelp, Vice President at The Conference Board. “Following the large
increase of 526,000 in January, over the next four months the increase in advertised
vacancies has averaged 66,000 per month. While we have now returned to the pre-
recession levels of labor demand, the big difference today is the larger number of
unemployed workers that are seeking jobs compared to four years ago.” In April 2011
(the latest unemployment data), there were just over 3 (3.18) unemployed for every
advertised vacancy, in contrast to the 1.5 unemployed for every vacancy in April
2007. Labor demand is still uneven across occupations. Although demand in most
occupations has picked up, with 6 of the 22 major occupation groups reaching all-
time highs this month, others are slower to rise and the demand for workers in legal
occupations has stalled.  REGIONAL AND STATE HIGHLIGHTS
All regions of the nation posted gains in May
Labor demand increased in 18 of the 20 larger States  Among the regions, the South posted the largest gain, 54,000, in May.   Maryland 
led the region with a gain of 14,500, while Texas (+14,200) and Georgia (+13,100)
followed close behind.  Florida rose by 7,000.  Rounding out the most populous
States in the South were  Virginia  (+4,400) and  North Carolina  (+400).  Among the
less populous States in the South,  Tennessee  gained 2,100 and  South Carolina  rose
1,300 to 50,100 online advertised vacancies in May. Alabama and Delaware were up by
600 and 400 respectively.  In May, the Midwest continued to move forward with its gain of 45,000.
Minnesota was the frontrunner with an increase of 14,000. Illinois and Ohio had
healthy gains of 11,800 and 10,800 respectively. Among the larger states,  Michigan 
rose by 4,900 to 123,300, Wisconsin rose 2,700 to 95,300, and Missouri was up 2,100
to 84,700.  Among the less populous States in the region, Indiana and Iowa both
posted losses of 2,700 and 900 respectively.   Nebraska , South Dakota, and North
Dakota all posted slight gains, 300, 600, and 1,500 respectively.  The West gained 35,100, offsetting its loss from last month. Washington led the
region with 12,000 for a total of 116,200. Since the end of 2010, Washington has
gained over 27,000. California was up 8,200, while Arizona (down 8,700) posted the
largest loss in the region. Colorado and Nevada were both up in May, 5,100 and 5,000
respectively, and labor demand in  Utah  rose 6,500. Utah’s overall growth this year
is 12,700.  Oregon  grew by 3,300. Some of the less populous States posting increases
included Idaho and Alaska, up 3,900 and 1,100 respectively.  The Northeast was up by 18,900 in May. Pennsylvania had the region’s largest
gain, 10,100, followed by  Massachusetts  (+8,800).  New Jersey  posted a slim 900
increase while New York fell by 7,300 to 267,000.  Among the smaller States in New
England,  Connecticut  climbed by 3,400 while  Rhode Island  and  Maine  inched up 400 and
300 respectively. New Hampshire and Vermont dipped slightly, down 400 and 100
respectively.  The Supply/Demand rate for the U.S. in April (the latest month for which
unemployment numbers are available) stood at 3.18, indicating that there are just
over three unemployed workers for every online advertised vacancy.  Nationally,
there are 9.4 million more unemployed workers than advertised vacancies. In April,
there were eight  States where there were fewer than two unemployed for every
advertised vacancy including  North Dakota  and Nebraska (Supply/Demand  rates of 1.06
and 1.40 respectively) as well as New Hampshire (1.47), Alaska (1.55), Vermont
(1.61), South Dakota (1.63), Virginia (1.85), and Maryland (1.92)  (Table 4). The
State with the highest Supply/Demand rate is Mississippi (7.51), where there are
more than 7 unemployed workers for every online advertised vacancy.  There are a
number of States in which there are over four unemployed for every advertised
vacancy including Kentucky (5.21), California (4.52), Alabama (4.50), South Carolina
(4.31), Florida (4.15), Michigan (4.08), and Tennessee (4.01).  It should be noted that the Supply/Demand rate only provides a measure of
relative tightness of the individual State labor markets and does not suggest that
the occupations of the unemployed directly align with the occupations of the
advertised vacancies (see Occupational Highlights section).  OCCUPATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
In May, 6 of the 22 major occupation groups reported in HWOL rose to all-time highs
Online advertised vacancies for legal occupations stall  Changes for the Month of May  In May, there were 608,200 advertised vacancies for workers in Computer and
mathematical science occupations, a rise of 25,100, reflecting increased demand for
a wide range of skills including network designers, biostatisticians, and geographic
information system technicians.  Building and grounds cleaning & maintenance
occupations were up 4,700 to 59,000 with increases for jobs such as building
cleaners and landscape workers such as tree trimmers.  Sales and related work rose 23,000 in May to 601,700 and reflected, in part,
increased demand for demonstrators and product promoters, sales representatives
including insurance and advertising agents, and a gain in the relatively small
category of securities and commodity traders which was offset by declines in
openings for sales personnel in securities and commodities.  Food preparation and
serving openings were up 3,000 to 138,300 and reflected increased demand for chefs
and head cooks, food service supervisors/managers, and cooks in restaurants and
fast-food establishments.  “There was also an increase in demand for baristas,” Shelp noted, “but the
monthly number of ads is small (less than 2,000).”  In both the Sales and Food
preparation and serving the number of unemployed outnumbered advertised openings
with 2.5 unemployed for every ad in sales and 8.5 more job seekers than openings in
food preparation and serving occupations.  Among the top 10 occupation groups with the largest numbers of online
advertised vacancies, categories posting increases included Office and
administrative support, up 16,900.  General office clerks, receptionists, and
information clerks were among the occupations that saw increases in advertised
vacancies that were partially offset by a drop in demand for billing and accounting
clerks and data entry clerks.  Management occupations were up 24,600 and reflected
increased demand in management areas ranging from construction managers and
transportation and distribution managers to financial and compensation and benefits
managers.  Business and finance rose 23,000 and reflected increases in demand for
property and casualty claims examiners, labor relations specialists, and employment
interviewers as well as smaller categories like energy auditors and sustainability
specialists.  Occupations that posted fewer vacancies in May included Healthcare
practitioners and technical occupations, down 3,400 to 565,100.  This drop was led
by declines in advertised vacancies for speech-language pathologists, occupational
therapists, and physical therapists.  At the same time Healthcare support
occupations rose 4,100 to 133,200.  Similar to the decline in healthcare
practitioners and technical positions, there were declines in openings for physical
therapist assistants and occupational therapist assistants.  Supply/Demand for Selected Occupations  “In May, workers in 6 of 22 of the major occupations groups are finding the
number of advertised vacancies is at the highest level since the HWOL series began
in May 2005,” said Shelp. (HWOL does not include a separate category for the 23rd
major occupation group, military occupations). The previous high for two of the six
major occupational groups, Art, design, entertainment, sports and media, and Sales
and related occupations were just prior to the official beginning of the recession
in December 2007.  For Building and grounds cleaning and maintenance and
Transportation and material moving, previous highs were in December 2005. These
occupational groups include a variety of occupations associated with both real
estate and manufacturing (pest control, janitors and house cleaning in real estate
and stock clerks, material handles and truck drivers associated with manufacturing
output) which had already turned down before the official start of the recession.
Computer and mathematical science and Personal care’s previous monthly highs were in
early 2008.  Although the number of online advertised vacancies in these occupations is at
new highs, the number of unemployed seeking jobs in these six occupational
categories is widely different and is reflected in the variation in their
Supply/demand rates.  In Computer and mathematical sciences occupations (a
Supply/Demand rate of 0.23), there are over 4 advertised vacancies for every
unemployed job seeker. Although the number of advertised vacancies declined
throughout the recession, it never dropped below two openings for every unemployed
worker seeking a position. This is in sharp contrast to just over 13 job seekers for
every advertised vacancy for Building and grounds cleaning & maintenance occupations
(a Supply/Demand rate of 13.4).  Supply/demand rates are for April 2011, the latest
data available for unemployment.  For other major occupation groups, the number of advertised openings remains
below their previous highs.  In Business and financial operations and Office
administrative support, for example, the number of online advertised vacancies has
increased since the end of the recession but remain below their pre-recession levels.
Advertised vacancies for Legal occupations have stalled and were 24,800 in May, a
monthly number that is in line with the average monthly volume since the official
end of the recession in June 2009.  METRO AREA HIGHLIGHTS
 Washington , D.C., Oklahoma City, Honolulu, and  Boston  have the lowest Supply/Demand
rates  In May, all of the 52 metropolitan areas for which data are reported separately
posted over-the-year increases in the number of online advertised vacancies. Among
the three metro areas with the largest numbers of advertised vacancies, the New York
metro area was 11.5 percent above its May 2010 level, the  Los Angeles  metro area was
15.5 percent above last year’s level, and the Washington, D.C. metro area was 7
percent above its May 2010 level.  The number of unemployed exceeded the number of advertised vacancies in all of
the 52 metro areas for which information is reported separately. Washington, DC
continues to have the most favorable Supply/Demand rate (1.17) with about one
advertised vacancy for every unemployed worker.  Oklahoma City , Honolulu, Boston,
Baltimore, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and San Jose were metropolitan locations where
there were just less than two unemployed looking for work for every advertised
vacancy (Table C). On the other hand, metro areas in which the respective number of
unemployed is substantially above the number of online advertised vacancies include
Riverside, CA -- where there are over nine unemployed people for every advertised
vacancy (9.07) -- Sacramento (5.73), Miami (4.96), and Los Angeles (4.42).
Supply/Demand rate data are for March 2011, the latest month for which unemployment
data for local areas are available.  PROGRAM NOTES  The Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine Data Series measures the number of new,
first-time online jobs and jobs reposted from the previous month on more than 1,200
major Internet job sites and smaller job sites that serve niche markets and smaller
geographic areas.  Like The Conference Board’s long-running Help Wanted Advertising Index of print
ads (which was published for over 55 years and discontinued in October 2008 but
continues to be available for research), the new online series is not a direct
measure of job vacancies.  The level of ads in print and online can change for
reasons not related to overall job demand.  With the December 1, 2008 release, HWOL began providing seasonally adjusted
data for the U.S., the nine Census regions and the 50 States. Seasonally adjusted
data for occupations were provided beginning with the December 2009 release. This
data series, for which the earliest data are for May 2005, continues to publish not
seasonally adjusted data for 52 large metropolitan areas.  People using this data are urged to review the information on the database and
methodology available on The Conference Board website and contact us with questions
and comments.  Background information and technical notes and discussion of
revisions to the series are available at:  http://www.conference -
