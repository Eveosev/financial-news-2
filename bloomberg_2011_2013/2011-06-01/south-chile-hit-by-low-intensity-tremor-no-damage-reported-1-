A low-intensity tremor struck the
southern Chilean regions of Maule and Los Rios, said the
government’s emergency agency, Onemi.  No injuries or damage were reported from the event at 8:57
a.m.  New York  today, Onemi said in a  statement  published on its
website.  The quake measured 6.3 on the Richter scale at a depth of
8.3 kilometers (5.2 miles), Onemi said, citing the national
seismology service. The  U.S. Geological Survey  said on its
website that the tremor took place at a depth of 15 kilometers.  Chile , which in February last year was hit by an 8.8-
magnitude earthquake, is the world’s largest producer of copper.
The mines are in the northern and central regions.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
