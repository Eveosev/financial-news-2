Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM)  Chief Executive Officer
Paul Jacobs said that 250 devices based on the company’s
Snapdragon processor are in the works, part of a push to extend
its dominance beyond radio chips.  These products are in addition to 125 that have already
been announced, Jacobs said at a company event today in  San
Diego , where Qualcomm is based. Snapdragon is Qualcomm’s
applications microprocessor, a chip that runs software in mobile
devices.  Qualcomm sells licenses to much of the technology that
underpins so-called 3G mobile-phone services, providing the
company with most of its profits. A surge in sales of phones
that can access the Internet is driving demand for Qualcomm’s
microprocessors and chips that translate radio signals into
voice and data, which contribute the majority of revenue.  Snapdragon represents the company’s attempt to increase the
amount of sales it gets from each phone and gain ground in the
market for chips that run devices including tablets and small
computers. Such mobile gadgets and phones are displacing
personal computers, Jacobs said.  “Mobile is now the dominant computing platform, and it’s
never going back,” he said. “Computing has changed forever.”  Qualcomm fell $1.44, or 2.5 percent, to $57.16 at 4 p.m.
New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has gained
15 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
