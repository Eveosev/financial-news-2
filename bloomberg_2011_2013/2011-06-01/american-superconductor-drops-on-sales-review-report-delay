American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) , a
wind-turbine component maker, closed at its lowest level in
almost five years after delaying its annual report to review
revenue from customers in  China .  The company fell $2.58, or 24 percent, to $8.11 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading, the lowest since July 24, 2006. The
companyâ€™s shares have fallen 72 percent this year.  American Superconductor is seeking an extension of as long
as 15 days to file the report, the Devens, Massachusetts-based
company said yesterday in a statement. The company said it would
reverse recognition of a material amount of revenue in the last
three quarters of the fiscal year that ended March 31.  On April 5, American Superconductor forecast full-year
revenue of less than $355 million and said that its largest
customer, China-based wind turbine maker Sinovel Wind Group Co.,
had refused to accept contracted shipments of core electrical
components.  To contact the reporters on this story:
