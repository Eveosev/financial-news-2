The pound rose against the dollar,
snapping a two-day decline, before a report that analysts said
may show U.K. manufacturing expanded for a 20th month in May.  Government bonds  declined before the U.K. manufacturing
Purchasing Managers Index, based on a survey by Markit Economics
and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which
economists said may slip to 54.1 for May from 54.6 in April. A
measure above 50 indicates expansion. The  Bank of England  may
say U.K. mortgage approvals increased in April, according to a
separate survey before the report today.  “There is a degree of nervousness going into the PMIs,”
said  Daragh Maher , deputy head of global foreign exchange
strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in London.  The pound rose 0.2 percent to $1.6487 as of 9:21 a.m. in
London. It was little changed at 87.51 pence per euro.  The yield on the 10-year gilt rose one basis point to 3.31
percent. Surveys for the construction and services industries
will be released tomorrow and the following day.  Sterling strengthened 1.3 percent against the euro last
month, while sliding 1.6 percent versus the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
