Central bankers in the euro region no
longer exclude the option of a soft restructuring of Greek debt,
 Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing unidentified
officials.  An extension of maturities may be possible without
triggering a chain reaction in financial markets, FTD said.
Under certain conditions, a voluntary contribution of the
private sector wouldn’t have to be considered a default, the
newspaper quoted unnamed central bankers as saying.  It is unclear whether the European Central Bank’s Governing
Council is unanimous in backing such a plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
