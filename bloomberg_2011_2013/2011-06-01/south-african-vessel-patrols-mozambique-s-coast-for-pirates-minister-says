South Africa  said it has deployed a
navy ship to patrol the waters off  Mozambique  to protect trade
vessels from pirate attacks, which pose an increasing threat to
merchants in the area.  South Africa and its northeastern neighbor Mozambique are
negotiating a deal aimed at “curbing piracy and other illegal
activities within the territorial waters of Mozambique before
these activities spill over down to the territorial waters of
South Africa,” Foreign Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said in
a written reply to a parliamentary question, sent to Bloomberg
News by e-mail today.  South Africa, the continent’s richest country, will also
try to help Somalia, from where the sea-robbers are widening
their operating area, Nkoana-Mashabane said. The Horn of Africa
country, where many pirates are based, is battling al-Shabaab
insurgents, which the U.S. accuses of having links to al-Qaeda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
