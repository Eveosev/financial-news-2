The dollar dropped to the lowest in
three weeks against the currencies of its major trading partners
as reports showed slower-than-forecast jobs growth and reduced
factory output, adding to concern the  U.S. economy  is slowing.  The U.S. currency weakened after a private survey showed
employment increased by 38,000 last month, the smallest gain
since September and a measure of manufacturing output in May
declined more than forecast. Forecasters reduced estimates for
May job growth before the June 3 Labor Department report. The
Swiss franc rose against all of its 16 major counterparts,
reaching a record against the dollar and the euro, as stocks and
commodities dropped, spurring haven demand.  “Weak data equals a weak dollar,” said Ray Attrill, a
senior currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York. “It’s
not surprising to see the dollar weaken substantially on the
basis of the data.”  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which
measures the greenback against the currencies of six trading
partners including the yen and the euro, fell 0.1 percent to
74.558 at 12:53 a.m. in  New York , after declining to 74.36, the
least since May 6.  The dollar dropped 0.8 percent to 80.88 yen, from 81.52 yen
yesterday. It fell 1.5 percent versus the franc to 84.12
centimes and reached 83.83 centimes, the weakest since at least
1971. The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.4406.  Swiss Strength  The Swiss franc strengthened as retail sales rose in April
at the fastest rate in two years, boosting speculation the  Swiss
National Bank  may raise borrowing costs. The currency reached
1.20855 per euro, the strongest on record. Retail sales climbed
7.5 percent in the year after a 0.2 percent drop in March, the
most since April 2009.  Canada ’s dollar and  Mexico ’s peso dropped the most among
the major currencies on the weaker U.S. data. The U.S. is both
nations’ biggest trading partner.  The Canadian dollar fell 0.5 percent to 97.36 cents versus
the greenback and the peso dropped 0.6 percent to 11.6391 per
dollar.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.4 percent,
snapping a four-day advance, and the Thompson/Reuters CRB Index
of raw materials fell 1.2 percent.  Fewer Jobs  U.S. employment increased last month after a revised
177,000 gain in April, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
called for a 175,000 advance for May.  The Labor Department will release May unemployment figures
June 3. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. revised its estimate today for
an increase in May nonfarm payrolls to 100,000 from 150,000,
while Citigroup Inc. trimmed its projection to 100,000 from
170,000.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to
53.5 in May from 60.4 the prior month, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group said today. Economists projected the gauge would drop to
57.1, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. Estimates of the 83 economists polled ranged from 53 to
60.  “The data has been consistently weak and is really
consistent with the view that the U.S. recovery has essentially
stalled,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in  Washington 
at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage.
“That would certainly warrant ultra-accommodative policy from
the Fed for the foreseeable future and that contrasts with
expectations for the European Central Bank to lift rates again
in July.”  Fed Stance  The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero to
0.25 percent and won’t raise it until the first quarter of 2012,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Central banks in other
developed-nations have begun tightening policy following the
recession, including the  European Central Bank  and the  Bank of
Canada .  European officials are trying to prevent the euro region’s
first sovereign default as investors dump Greek bonds on concern
the government won’t be able to meet its obligations.  Investors may be offered preferred status, higher coupon
payments or collateral as inducements to buy bonds replacing
Greek debt maturing between 2012 and 2014, said two people with
knowledge of discussions, who declined to be identified because
the talks are in progress.  So-called negative incentives are also under consideration,
such as cutting off old Greek bonds from eligibility for use as
collateral with the European Central Bank, the people said.  The dollar may drop to less than 80 yen as Treasury yields
extend declines, according to  Greg Anderson , a senior currency
strategist at Citigroup Inc. in New York.  “If the payrolls report comes in weak like the ADP report,
and we get U.S. 10-year yields falling below 3 percent and two-
year yields dive below 40 basis points, you’re probably going to
see dollar-yen fall below 80 yen, with potential to go to 79 or
78 on a short-term dip,” Anderson said in a telephone
interview. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Yields on the Treasury 10-year notes fell to less than 3
percent for the first time in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
