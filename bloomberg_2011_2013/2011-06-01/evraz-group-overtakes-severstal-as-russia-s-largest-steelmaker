Evraz Group SA (EVR) , the steelmaker part-
owned by billionaire  Roman Abramovich , became Russia’s largest
after competitor OAO Severstal sold three unprofitable mills in
the U.S., company documents show.  Evraz made 16.3 million metric tons of crude steel last
year, it said in a bond prospectus today. Severstal’s output was
14.7 million tons, excluding the plants it sold in March,
according to figures in a  presentation  on the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
