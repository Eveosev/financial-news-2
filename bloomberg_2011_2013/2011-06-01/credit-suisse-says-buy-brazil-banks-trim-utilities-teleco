Credit Suisse Group AG suggested
adding to an “overweight” position in Brazilian financial
stocks while cutting holdings of utilities and phone operators
as inflation will likely ease through August.  Utilities were lowered to “market weight” in Credit
Suisse’s “model portfolio” of Brazilian stocks for June, while
telecommunications remained “overweight,” according to a note
to clients dated yesterday from analyst Andrew T. Campbell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
