Arabica coffee dropped the most in
three weeks as favorable weather may aid crops in  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer and exporter. Sugar and cocoa fell.  Coffee-growing areas in Brazil won’t face the risk of frost
in the next 15 days, forecaster Somar Meteorologia said
yesterday. Prices have tumbled 17 percent since touching the
highest since May 1997 last month amid an improving outlook for
global production.  “Prices are under pressure as there are no predictions of
a frost in Brazil,” said  Boyd Cruel , a senior analyst at Vision
Financial Markets in Chicago. “We are also witnessing some
technical selling.”  Arabica coffee for July delivery fell 8.65 cents, or 3.3
percent, to settle at $2.5595 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York , the biggest drop since May 11. Prices slumped
12 percent last month, the most since June 2009.  The commodity touched $3.089 on May 3, the highest in
almost 14 years, as adverse weather threatened crops in
 Colombia , the second-biggest grower.  Raw-sugar futures for July delivery declined 0.72 cent, or
3.1 percent, to 22.46 cents a pound on ICE, the first loss since
May 23.  Cocoa futures for July delivery tumbled $46, or 1.5
percent, to $2,953 a metric ton in New York.  In  London , robusta coffee, refined sugar and cocoa
retreated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
