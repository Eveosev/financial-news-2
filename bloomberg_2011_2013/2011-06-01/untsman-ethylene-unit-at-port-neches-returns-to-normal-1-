Huntsman Corp.  returned an ethylene
unit to normal operations at its Port Neches,  Texas , chemical
plant after a “power blip” caused an interruption in
operations, according to a filing with state regulators.  The power interruption at the ethylene oxide unit caused
the flaring of ethylene and ethylene oxide, the company said in
a  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  “The ethylene unit returned to normal operation as soon as
the ethylene oxide unit was restarted yesterday,” Anne Knisely,
a spokeswoman based at company headquarters in The Woodlands,
Texas, said in an e-mail today.  The facility, called a cracker, splits oil products like
naphtha and liquefied petroleum gases through pressure and heat.
Outages can increase prices for ethylene and propylene as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts.  The plant is 100 miles (161 kilometers) east of Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
