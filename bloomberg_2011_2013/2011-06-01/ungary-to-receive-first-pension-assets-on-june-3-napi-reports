Hungary will probably receive the
first assets taken over from private pension funds on June 3,
 Napi Gazdasag  reported, citing Laszlo Andras Borbely, deputy
chief executive officer at the  Debt Management Agency .  The debt agency, which is coordinating the process, will
have more precise data on the assets next week, Borbely told the
newspaper.  The takeover may be completed by June 10 or June 14, Napi
reported. After that, the agency can start selling the more
liquid assets, such as the foreign shares acquired from the
pension funds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
