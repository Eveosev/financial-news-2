The euro weakened against most of its
major peers as uncertainty over aid to  Greece  reduced the appeal
of assets denominated in the single European currency.  The euro fell from a three-week high against the dollar,
erasing an earlier advance, after two people with knowledge of
the talks said Greece’s next aid package may include incentives
for bondholders to roll over maturing debt without triggering a
default. The Dollar Index declined before reports that will
probably show U.S. companies hired fewer workers and
manufacturing cooled. The Swiss franc strengthened as data
showed retail sales rose at the fastest rate for two years.  “Until there’s clarity on where the debate is going, you
will get this volatility in the euro,” said  Paul Robson , a
senior foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc in London. “Clearly there’s still lots to discuss and
it’s just taken the edge off the euro, which had rallied pretty
hard over the last few days.”  The euro was little changed at $1.4404 as of 7:34 a.m. in
 New York , after advancing as much as 0.4 percent to $1.4448. It
declined 0.2 percent to fetch 117.16 yen. The dollar slipped 0.2
percent against the Japanese currency to 81.38 yen.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which
measures the greenback against the currencies of six trading
partners, was 0.1 percent lower at 74.54 after declining to
74.39, the least since May 6.  Greek Debt Incentives  European officials are trying to prevent the euro region’s
first sovereign default as investors dump Greek bonds on concern
the government won’t be able to meet its obligations.  Investors may be offered preferred status, higher coupon
payments or collateral as inducements to buy bonds replacing
Greek debt maturing between 2012 and 2014, said two people with
knowledge of discussions, who declined to be identified because
the talks are in progress.  So-called negative incentives are also under consideration,
such as cutting off old Greek bonds from eligibility for use as
collateral with the  European Central Bank , the people said.  The dollar weakened before data forecast to show companies
in the U.S. added 175,000 workers in May compared with 179,000
the prior month. That’s according to the median estimate of 37
economists in a Bloomberg survey before the private ADP
Employers Services report. Labor Department data on June 3 will
show a 180,000 gain in payrolls compared with April’s 244,000
increase, a separate survey shows.  Swiss Retail Sales  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index, due
today in the U.S., probably fell to 57.1 last month, the lowest
since October, according to the median forecast. Readings above
50 signal expansion.  “If there’s any evidence of a considerable worsening in
the employment situation, I think that would certainly hit
confidence pretty significantly,” said  Derek Halpenny , European
head of currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd.
in London. “There’s also downside risks for the ISM
manufacturing today.”  The Swiss franc advanced against all 16 of its major
counterparts as a report showed retail sales climbed 7.5 percent
in April, boosting speculation the  Swiss National Bank  may raise
borrowing costs. Separate data showed the SVME purchasing
managers index rose to 59.2 in May from 58.4 in April, beating a
median forecast of a decline to 57.5.  The franc gained 0.9 percent to 1.2179 per euro. It reached
1.2102 on May 27, the strongest on record, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Swiss currency appreciated 0.9
percent to 84.60 centimes per dollar.  The pound slid amid concern over the strength of the U.K.’s
economic recovery after data showed manufacturing and mortgage
approvals slumped.  The British currency slipped 0.2 percent to $1.6419, after
earlier advancing as much as 0.3 percent. It depreciated 0.2
percent to 87.67 pence per euro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
