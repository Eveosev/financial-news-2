Grain planting in  Canada  is about 73
percent complete, matching last year and behind the 87 percent
normal pace for this time, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  Temperatures were as much as 5 degrees Celsius below normal
last week, with northern areas of the Prairies and Manitoba
having overnight frosts, the board said in a  statement  on its
website.  As much as 8.5 centimeters (3.3 inches) of rain fell in
much of  Alberta , while Saskatchewan got as much as 6.5
centimeters and southwest Manitoba had as much as 2.5
centimeters. Planting delays are “most significant” from
south-central Saskatchewan to central Manitoba, the board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
