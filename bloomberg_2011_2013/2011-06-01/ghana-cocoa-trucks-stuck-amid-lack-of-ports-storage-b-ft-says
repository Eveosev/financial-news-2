More than 400 vehicles, each carrying
about 600 bags of cocoa, have been stuck at ports in  Ghana  over
the past month due to a shortage of storage facilities for the
beans, Business and Financial Times reported.  The delay in offloading cocoa has raised concerns about
whether the beans are rotting, the Accra-based newspaper
reported, citing officials from cocoa-buying companies it didnâ€™t
identify.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
