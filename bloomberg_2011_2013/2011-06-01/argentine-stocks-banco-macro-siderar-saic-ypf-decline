The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of 11:25 a.m.  New York  time.  The Merval Index fell 0.8 percent to 3,223.59.  Banco Macro SA (BMA)  ,  Argentina ’s largest lender by
market value, declined 1.7 percent to 14.10 pesos. The price of
Argentine sovereign bonds fell today, which signals lower value
for banks’ fixed-income holdings.  Siderar SAIC (ERAR)  , Argentina’s largest steel producer,
dropped 1 percent to 29 pesos as a report showed that U.S.
manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace in more than a year.
Siderar, the Argentine unit of Luxembourg-based  Ternium SA (TX) , gets
almost all its revenue from sales in the Americas.  YPF SA (YPFD)  , the Argentina unit of Repsol YPF, fell
2.2 percent to 197.50 pesos as crude oil dropped in New York.
Oil fell after a private report showed that U.S. companies added
fewer jobs than forecast last month, bolstering concern that the
economy and fuel demand growth will slow. Crude oil for July
delivery declined 76 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $101.92 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
