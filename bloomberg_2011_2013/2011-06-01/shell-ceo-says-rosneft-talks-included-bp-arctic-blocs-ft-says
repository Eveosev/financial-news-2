Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  Chief Executive
Officer  Peter Voser  said discussions with OAO Rosneft in  Russia 
last week about exploring in the Arctic included three blocs in
the South Kara Sea that would have been part of Rosneft’s
alliance with  BP Plc (BP/) , the Financial Times reported, citing
comments from Voser.  While the talks had looked at “a multitude of blocs,” it
was still “too early to say where this will go,” Voser said,
according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
