Telecom Egypt (ETEL)  headed for its biggest
daily gain in more than a week after first-quarter profit for
the monopoly fixed-line telephone company beat analyst
estimates.  The shares rose as much as 2.5 percent to 15.92 Egyptian
pounds, the biggest intraday advance since May 22. They traded
up 1.7 percent at 15.80 Egyptian pounds at 11:42 a.m. in Cairo.
The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  retreated less than 0.1 percent.  Telecom Egypt said first-quarter profit fell 10 percent to
892 million Egyptian pounds ($150 million), beating the 752.6
million pound average estimate of five analysts on Bloomberg.  Profit declined from 992 million pounds a year earlier
after communications services were disrupted by anti-government
protests, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
