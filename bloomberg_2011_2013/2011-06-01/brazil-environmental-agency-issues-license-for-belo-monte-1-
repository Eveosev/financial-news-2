Norte Energia SA, the group building
the 25.8 billion-real ($16 billion) Belo Monte dam in  Brazil ’s
Amazon, received a license from the nation’s environment agency
to begin construction.  A technical team from the agency will monitor construction
of the dam and guarantee compliance with environmental
requirements, the agency, known as Ibama, said today in an e-
mailed statement.  The project will flood 516 square kilometers (199 square
miles) of forest and has been criticized by the Organization of
the American States, Avatar director  James Cameron  and former
U.S. President Bill Clinton.  State-run Centrais Electricas Brasileiras SA, known as
Eletrobras, is the biggest shareholder in  Norte Energia . Vale
SA, the world’s biggest iron-ore producer, said April 29 it
would take a stake of as much as 9 percent in the group and
invest about 2.3 billion reais in the dam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
