Japanese bond futures may extend
declines to a five-week low after falling below their 20-day
moving average, Mizuho Investors Securities Co. said, citing
trading patterns.  Ten-year contracts for June delivery closed at 140.63
yesterday, breaking below the moving average of 140.66 for the
first time since April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The futures climbed to a two-month high of 141 on May 27.  The decline below the moving average suggests they “will
wind down their rally and adjust in the short-term,” said
 Akihiko Inoue , chief market analyst at the unit of  Japan ’s
second-largest bank in  Tokyo .  Ten-year futures traded at 140.61 at the 11 a.m. morning
close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Benchmark contracts have
traded in a range of 138.32 to 141.17 this year.  The securities are now poised to fall to 140.29, their high
reached on May 2, and then to as low as 139.69, a 50 percent
retracement of the rally from April 8 to May 27, Inoue said,
referring to Fibonacci analysis. The contracts last traded at
139.69 on April 25.  The 250-day moving average, currently at 140.95, is likely
to remain a resistance level for the time being, Inoue said.
Futures failed to close above this level last month even though
they rose above it in intra-day trading.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise or
fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. Key
percentages include 38.2, 50 and 61.8 and 76.4. A break above
resistance, where sell orders may be clustered, or below support,
indicates a currency may move to the next level.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on the story:
