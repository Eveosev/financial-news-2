Commercial International Bank Egypt
SAE (COMI)  fell the most in more than a month, leading a decline in
lenders after the central bank reported total local-currency
deposits fell for a fourth consecutive month.  Shares of the Arab country’s biggest publicly traded lender
retreated as much as 2.3 percent, the biggest intraday decrease
since April 20, to 30.98 pounds and traded 1.8 percent down at
31.15 pounds by 12:32 p.m. in Cairo. Credit Agricole  Egypt , the
country’s third-biggest publicly traded bank, fell 2.6 percent.
Nine out of the 12 banks traded on the Egyptian Exchange
dropped. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  fell 0.2 percent.  Local-currency deposits in Egyptian banks declined in April
to 643.1 billion pounds ($108 billion), the  central bank  said on
its website, as the economy reacted to the popular uprising that
toppled President  Hosni Mubarak . Private-sector borrowing fell
to 321.3 billion pounds from 321.6 billion pounds in the
previous month, according to the data. Total domestic credit
rose to 879 billion pounds from 870.5 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
