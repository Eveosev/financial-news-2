Brazilian banks and homebuilders are
likely to lead a rebound in the Bovespa index this month as
inflation concerns ease, Banco BTG Pactual SA said.  BTG added real-estate companies MRV Engenharia &
Participacoes SA and  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  and lender  Itau
Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  to its June portfolio of Brazilian stocks,
according to a note today from analyst Carlos Sequeira.  The portfolio maintained holdings of 20 percent each in oil
producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA and iron-ore miner Vale SA, the
note said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
