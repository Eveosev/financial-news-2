Michelle Applebaum , managing partner
at Chicago-based Steel Market Intelligence, comments on the
Chinese and Asian market for the metal in an e-mailed note
yesterday.  “While Chinese pricing has shown surprising strength in
the face of new record-breaking production levels - and slowing
economic growth - we’re seeing signs of cracks in the ‘Chinese
wall’ of pricing, with meaningful weakness now showing up in
East Asia and  Japan , where we saw an unprecedented 11 price cuts
last week and zero increases.  ‘‘While overall Chinese steel exports were up 17 percent
through April, we suspect that the weaker pricing in  China ’s
neighborhood is a result of a larger increase in Chinese exports
in May, which won’t be reported for another week.  ‘‘The Chinese market worries us for another reason besides
exports as we’re concerned Chinese steel buyers are building
inventories ahead of well-publicized power-driven summer
production cuts.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
