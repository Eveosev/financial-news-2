The cost of protecting corporate
bonds from default in the U.S. climbed by the most since the
series began in March as manufacturing growth slowed and
employers hired fewer workers than forecast.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 2.6 basis points to a
mid-price of 92.1 basis points as of 5:07 p.m. in  New York ,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. That’s the
biggest jump since a new series was introduced on March 21.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 2.3 percent to
1,314.55 after the U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s
factory index fell more than projected to the lowest level since
September 2009. A separate report by ADP Employer Services
showed companies in the U.S. added 38,000 workers in May, less
than the median estimate of 175,000 forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey.  The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has dropped
from a high this year of 96.8 basis points on March 22.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
