The Swiss franc and the yen gained
against their most-traded counterparts as weaker data from the
U.S. to  China  increased concern the global economic recovery is
slowing, boosting demand for haven assets.  The franc reached a record against the dollar and the euro
after manufacturing in the U.S. and China grew at the slowest
pace in at least nine months. Currencies of commodity-exporting
countries weakened as raw material prices dropped and stocks
slumped, damping demand for higher-yielding assets. The euro
dropped after Moody’s Investors Service lowered its rating on
Greek bonds.  “It’s a pretty nasty witch’s brew for risky assets,” said
 Richard Franulovich , a senior currency strategist at Westpac
Banking Corp. in New York. The franc and the yen “will
strengthen in times of stress.”  The franc rose 1.4 percent to 84.20 centimes per dollar at
5 p.m. in  New York , reaching 83.83 centimes, the strongest since
at least 1971. It added 1.9 percent versus the euro, touching
1.20568, the most on record. The yen gained 0.7 percent to 80.95
per dollar, from 81.52 yesterday.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which
measures the greenback against the currencies of six trading
partners, rose 0.3 percent to 74.87 after earlier dropping as
much as 0.4 percent.  Franc Strength  The franc strengthened as retail sales rose in April at the
fastest rate in two years, boosting speculation the  Swiss
National Bank  may raise borrowing costs. Retail sales climbed
7.5 percent in the year after a 0.2 percent drop in March, the
most since April 2009.  Canada ’s dollar and  Mexico ’s peso dropped against most of
their major counterparts on the weaker U.S. data. The U.S. is
both nations’ biggest trading partner. The countries also both
export commodities, such as oil.  The Canadian dollar fell 0.9 percent to 97.72 cents versus
the greenback and the peso dropped 1.2 percent to 11.7091 per
dollar.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 2.3 percent,
snapping a four-day advance, and the Thompson/Reuters CRB Index
of raw materials fell 1.2 percent.  Factory Output  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to
53.5 in May from 60.4 the prior month, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group said today. Economists projected the gauge would drop to
57.1, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. Estimates of the 83 economists polled ranged from 53 to
60.  China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 52 from 52.9 in
April, the lowest level since August, the China Federation of
Logistics and Purchasing said in an e-mailed statement. The
index has a seasonal pattern of falling in May, economists said
before the release.  U.S. employment increased 38,000 last month, the smallest
increase since September, from a rev last month after a revised
177,000 gain in April, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
called for a 175,000 advance for May.  The Labor Department will release May unemployment figures
June 3. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. revised its estimate today for
an increase in May nonfarm payrolls to 100,000 from 150,000,
while Citigroup Inc. trimmed its projection to 100,000 from
170,000.  ‘Consistently Weak’  “The data has been consistently weak and is really
consistent with the view that the U.S. recovery has essentially
stalled,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in  Washington 
at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a currency brokerage.
“That would certainly warrant ultra-accommodative policy from
the Fed for the foreseeable future and that contrasts with
expectations for the European Central Bank to lift rates again
in July.”  The Fed has kept its benchmark interest rate at zero to
0.25 percent and won’t raise it until the first quarter of 2012,
according to a Bloomberg News survey. Central banks in other
developed-nations have begun tightening policy following the
recession, including the European Central Bank and the  Bank of
Canada .  The euro extended its decline after Moody’s said it
downgraded  Greece ’s local and foreign currency bond ratings to
Caa1 from B1 and assigned a negative outlook to the ratings.
European officials are trying to prevent the euro region’s first
sovereign default as investors dump Greek bonds on concern the
government won’t be able to meet its obligations.  European Debt  Investors may be offered preferred status, higher coupon
payments or collateral as inducements to buy bonds replacing
Greek debt maturing between 2012 and 2014, said two people with
knowledge of discussions, who declined to be identified because
the talks are in progress.  So-called negative incentives are also under consideration,
such as cutting off old Greek bonds from eligibility for use as
collateral with the  European Central Bank , the people said.  The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.4328.  The dollar may drop to less than 80 yen as Treasury yields
extend declines, according to  Greg Anderson , a senior currency
strategist at Citigroup in New York.  “If the payrolls report comes in weak like the ADP report,
and we get U.S. 10-year yields falling below 3 percent and two-
year yields dive below 40 basis points, you’re probably going to
see dollar-yen fall below 80 yen, with potential to go to 79 or
78 on a short-term dip,” Anderson said in a telephone
interview. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Yields on the Treasury 10-year notes fell to less than 3
percent for the first time in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
