Sugar climbed for a sixth day in New
York, the longest winning streak in four months, on speculation
supplies won’t meet demand due to harvest delays in top producer
 Brazil . Cocoa slid.  Sugar production in Brazil’s Center South, the country’s
main producing region, slumped 17 percent in the first-half of
May, industry association Unica said. Output dropped to 1.55
million metric tons in the first-half of the month, from 1.87
million tons a year earlier, it said.  “There are no offers anymore for June sugar out of
Brazil” and that July seems to be following the track,  Naim
Beydoun , a broker at Swiss Sugar Brokers in Rolle,  Switzerland ,
wrote in a report e-mailed today.  Raw sugar for July delivery rose 0.29 cent, or 1.3 percent,
to 23.47 cents a pound by 8:06 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York . It’s the longest rally for the July contract since Feb. 2.
White, or refined, sugar for August delivery climbed $10, or 1.5
percent, to $682 a ton on NYSE Liffe in London.  The “white sugar balance is well in shortage; offers
remain very scarce for both refined and crystal sugar,” Beydoun
said in the report. The white sugar premium over the raw
sweetener climbed to $164.08, the highest value since June 18,
according to data on Bloomberg.  Thai Supplies  Supplies of white sugar are likely to increase later in the
year as millers in Thailand, the world’s second-largest shipper,
start processing raw sugar into the refined variety.  “The combination of a white premium trading above $160,
August-October spreads now ranging over $50, expensive cash
premiums and lack of sugar availability for the spot, should
speed up the re-melting process into white sugar from
 Thailand ,” Beydoun said in the report.  Arabica coffee for July delivery was little changed at
$2.6455 a pound in New York. Robusta coffee for July delivery
slid $10, or 0.4 percent, to $2,592 a ton in London.  Cocoa for July delivery dropped $12, or 0.4 percent, to
$2,987 a ton in New York. Cocoa for July delivery slid 12 pounds
to 1,828 pounds ($3,003) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Cocoa bean exports from  Indonesia ’s Central Sulawesi
province rose to 3,820 tons in May from 845 tons a month
earlier, Herman Agan, head of the provincial branch at the
nation’s cocoa association, said in a mobile-phone text message
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
