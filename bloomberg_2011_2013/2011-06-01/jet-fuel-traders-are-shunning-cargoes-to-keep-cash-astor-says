European  oil companies  are purchasing
fewer jet fuel cargoes to conserve cash, limiting any increase
in stockpiles, said Tony Astor, a former buyer for U.K.
airports.  Jet fuel inventories fell to the lowest level in more than
2 1/2 years in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area May 26 as
the peak summer holiday flying season begins in Europe,
according to PJK International BV.  “There are no alarm bells ringing” as stockpiles dwindle,
Astor, former head of fuel strategy for BAA Airports Plc and
founder of Astor Consulting, said by phone yesterday. “It’s a
cash-retention, cash-generation exercise.”  Charter rates for tankers carrying 65,000 metric ton
refined oil cargoes into Europe from the Persian Gulf fell 1.1
percent to $29.66 a ton today after sliding 8 percent last
month, according to the  Baltic Exchange  in London.  Supplies of  aviation fuel  in independent
storage at Antwerp, Rotterdam and Amsterdam have fallen to
472,000 tons, the least since Oct. 16, 2008, according to data
from Oosterhout, Netherlands-based PJK.  Jet fuel, which trades relative to gasoil, or heating oil,
on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, was priced at a premium
of $93.75 a ton yesterday, down 4.1 percent from May 20.  The amount of cargo being transported to Europe from
elsewhere in the world isn’t unusual and isn’t sufficient to
replenish stockpiles, Astor said.  BP Plc (BP/)  booked the Selini tanker to ship 65,000 tons of jet
fuel at a cost of $1.95 million to Northern Europe from the
Persian Gulf for loading June 2, according to data from Clarkson
Research Services Ltd.  Sheila Williams , a London-based BP
spokeswoman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
