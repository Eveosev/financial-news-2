Overseas investors bought a net 12.6
billion rupees (280.1 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
paring total outflows from equities this year to 6.4 billion
rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners purchased 61.7 billion rupees of shares and sold
49.1 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They sold 1.31 billion rupees of bonds, reducing
their debt purchases this year to 136.7 billion rupees.  Foreign funds bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. The Sensex has
fallen 9.3 percent this year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.465 trillion rupees in equities and 923.3 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
