Botswana’s economy is “back onto a
strong growth trajectory” due to a rebound in diamond exports
and good government policies, the  International Monetary Fund 
said.  While inflation has accelerated there isn’t firm evidence
of generalized price pressures in the southern African nation’s
economy and the IMF supports the central bank’s neutral stance
on  interest rates , the Washington-based institution said in a
statement on its website.  The government must continue efforts to reduce its large
state wage bill, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
