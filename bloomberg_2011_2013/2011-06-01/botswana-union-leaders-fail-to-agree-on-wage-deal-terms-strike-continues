The Botswanan government said a wage-
negotiation meeting held yesterday between public sector union
leaders and government was concluded without any agreement,
according to an e-mailed press release.  The government maintained its unconditional offer of a 3
percent inflationary adjustment across the board effective
September, and urged employees to return to work saying other
demands will be negotiated later, Festinah Bakwena, director of
public service management said.   “There is lack of respect on the part of the government
that has just developed and we cannot take that,” Botswana
Federation of Public Sector Unions spokesperson, Goretetse
Kekgonegile said by phone today.  “The strike will therefore continue until we meet as union
leadership to map a way forward sometime today,” Kekgonegile
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
