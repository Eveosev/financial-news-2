Agrokor d.d.,  Croatia ’s largest
privately held company, expects revenue to expand 6 percent this
year, driven by consumer demand, Executive Vice President Ljerka Puljic said.  “Our results in the first five months have been very
good,” Puljic said today in an interview on the sidelines of a
business forum in Zagreb. “This is our forecast without
acquisitions.”  Revenue in 2010 was 26.5 billion kuna ($5.1 billion),
little changed from the year before, she said. Earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization reached 2.4
billion kuna in the period, Puljic said.  The company, that now employs 40,000, has come a long way
from its communist-era days when it was a family-run flower
business. Its activities bloomed as it expanded and combined the
consumer goods industry with food retail and distribution after
borders and trade bloomed when civil wars of the 1990s ended in
the former  Yugoslavia .  Standard & Poor’s  Rating Services yesterday reaffirmed
Agrokor with a ‘B’ rating, saying a danger to the company’s
liquidity is no longer present after its bid for a 23 percent
stake in rival Slovenian food retailer  Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR) 
d.d. expired. S&P put Agrokor on negative watch on April 7,
saying its interest in Mercator may hurt its liquidity.  In February, Agrokor bid for Mercator’s stake. Other
bidders were Warburg Pincus LLC and Mid Europa Partners Ltd. Its
offer was rejected on May 4. Puljic wouldn’t comment on the
failed opportunity.  To contact the reporters on this story:
