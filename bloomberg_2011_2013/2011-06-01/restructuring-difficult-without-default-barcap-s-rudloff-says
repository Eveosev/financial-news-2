Sovereign debt restructurings are
difficult to carry out without the nation defaulting, according
to Barclays Capital Chairman Hans-Joerg Rudloff.  Rudloff, who worked on  Argentina ’s debt restructuring,
discussed austerity programs and government debt crises on the
sidelines of the International Capital Market Association annual
conference in Paris on May 27. He is the outgoing chairman of
ICMA.  On the difficulties of restructuring:  “The word restructuring or recalibration is being used
much too liberally by many people who simply do not understand
how difficult such an exercise will be, without a default. So-
called voluntary restructuring can only function with
important credit enhancement, as otherwise many holders most
likely have a fiduciary responsibility to try to enforce their
claims.”  On implementing austerity programs:  “If you are in a debt trap, you have to look at all
possible avenues to get out of it as soon as possible. You can
obviously earn yourself out of it with a major restructuring of
the economy and your budget. This usually implies austerity
programs which in turn demand huge sacrifices by the population
and require quite a number of years, before the benefits become
visible. Democracies rarely give government the time to
implement these programs.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
