Aston Villa  manager  Gerard Houllier 
quit the English Premier League soccer club two months after
being sidelined with a heart problem.  The Frenchman’s departure was announced today on Villa’s
website. The 63-year-old took charge of the team in September,
and suffered a tear in his descending aorta in April, missing
the last five games of the season.  “We regret the circumstances of Gerard’s departure and,
naturally, we wish him well in his continued recovery,” said
chief executive officer Paul Faulkner in the statement on the
club’s website. “I know I speak for everyone associated with
Aston Villa in expressing our hope that Gerard will return to
full health as quickly as possible and we wish him all the best
for the future.”  The team has started the search for a new manager. Houllier
said he would spend a few months recuperating before getting
back into sports.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
