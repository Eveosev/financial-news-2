France Telecom SA (FTE) ,  France ’s biggest
phone company, and  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Canal Plus unit are in talks to
renegotiate a movie service deal.  The two companies in January said they were planning to
form a strategic partnership by merging  France Telecom ’s Orange
Cinema Series television channels with Canal Plus in a 50-50
venture. France Telecom Chief Executive Officer Stephane Richard
said in Paris today that a new deal may involve Canal Plus
taking a minority stake in the venture.  The companies aimed to create a new premium channel, Orange
Cine Star, offering exclusive films and TV series. Richard, who
took over the largest French phone company in March 2011, has
deemphasized the in-house content operations created by his
predecessor, Didier Lombard, in favor of co-operation with
outside editorial teams.  To contact the reporter on this story:
