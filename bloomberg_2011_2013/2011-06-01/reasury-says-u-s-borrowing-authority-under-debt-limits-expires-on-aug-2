The Treasury Department reiterated
that U.S. authority to borrow under the existing debt limit will
expire on Aug. 2.  The Treasury “continues to project that the United States
will exhaust its borrowing authority under the debt limit” on
that date,  Mary Miller , the Treasury’s assistant secretary for
financial markets, said in a statement today.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  “continues to urge
Congress to avoid the catastrophic economic and market
consequences of a default crisis by raising the statutory debt
limit in a timely manner,” she said.  The U.S. stayed under the $14.29 trillion debt limit last
month by taking what Geithner has called “extraordinary
measures.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
