Crude oil dropped the most in three
weeks after data showed that U.S. companies added fewer jobs
than forecast last month and the expansion of manufacturing
slowed, bolstering concern fuel demand growth will weaken.  Oil fell 2.4 percent after ADP Employer Services said
employment rose by 38,000 in May, the smallest gain since
September. A 175,000 increase was forecast, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s
factory index decreased to the lowest level since September
2009, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today.  “We’ve received disappointing economic news all week,”
said  Peter Beutel , the president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an
energy advisory company in  New Canaan ,  Connecticut . “Consumers
are fearful about the future, which translates into lower fuel
demand. The bottom line is that oil is overpriced given the
economic outlook.”  Crude oil for July delivery declined $2.41 to settle at
$100.29 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
biggest single-session drop since May 11. Futures are up 38
percent from a year ago.  Brent crude oil for July delivery fell $2.20, or 1.9
percent, to end the session at $114.53 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Prices dropped from the settlement after the  American
Petroleum Institute  reported at 4:30 p.m. in  Washington  that
U.S. crude-oil stockpiles increased 3.47 million barrels to
371.6 million. July oil fell $2.99, or 2.9 percent, to $99.71 a
barrel in electronic trading at 4:35 p.m.  Additional Aid  Oil rose to a three-week high yesterday in New York when
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  signaled more aid
for Greece will be announced this month. The contract climbed
2.1 percent to $102.70, the highest settlement since May 10.  “The ADP report came out and added to concerns about
demand,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at PFGBest
in  Chicago . “We were on a bailout high earlier. The news that
European leaders were working on a new rescue plan for  Greece 
had given the market a boost.”  The ISM’s factory index fell to 53.5 last month from 60.4
in April. The group’s production index decreased to 54 from 63.8
in April. The new orders measure fell to 51.0, the lowest level
since June 2009, from 61.7.  Businesses probably added 206,000 jobs in May after a
268,000 gain in April, economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
estimate a Labor Department report to show in two days.  Economic Numbers  “The recent economic numbers are looking pretty weak,”
said Carl Larry, director of energy derivatives and research at
Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York. “We are all waiting on
Friday’s jobless numbers to give us a better idea about how the
economy is doing.”  Concern that the economic rebound is faltering sent
equities lower. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 2.3
percent to 1,314.55, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
dropped 279.65 points to 12,290.14.  “The drop in the stock market is adding to negative
sentiment and sending the oil markets even lower,” Beutel said.  Federal Reserve officials have said the jobless rate
“remains elevated” at 9 percent, one reason central bankers
pledged at their last meeting to complete an asset-purchase plan
by the end of this month and to keep borrowing costs near zero.  “Prices won’t drop much because the disappointing economic
data opens the door to additional Fed measures to kick start the
economy,” Larry said.  Chinese Manufacturing  China’s manufacturing expanded at the slowest pace in nine
months in May as the government extended a campaign to cool
inflation and the  property market , a survey of companies showed.  The country’s Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 52 from
52.9 in April, the  China  Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
said in an e-mailed statement today. The number was higher than
the median forecast of 51.6 in a Bloomberg News survey.  The U.S. and China are the world’s biggest oil-consuming
countries, responsible for 32 percent of global demand in 2009,
according to BP Plc, which publishes its Statistical Review of
World Energy each June.  The  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ’ crude
output increased for a second straight month in May, led by
gains from  Saudi Arabia  and  Nigeria , a Bloomberg News survey
showed.  Production rose 165,000 barrels, or 0.6 percent, to average
28.895 million barrels a day, according to the survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts. Saudi Arabia bolstered output
by 75,000 barrels, or 0.8 percent, to 8.925 million barrels a
day, the highest level since October 2008. Nigerian production
rose 75,000 barrels a day to 2.06 million last month.  U.S. Inventories  An Energy Department report tomorrow will probably show
that crude oil stockpiles dropped 1.6 million barrels last week,
according to the median of 13 analyst responses in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Gasoline consumption slipped 0.3 percent to an average 8.96
million barrels a day in the four weeks ended May 20, 2.1
percent lower than a year earlier, the Energy Department said.  “Gasoline demand is already down from a year ago and may
weaken further because of the sluggish economy,” Flynn said.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 610,521
contracts as of 4:36 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 580,479
yesterday, 13 percent below the average of the past three
months. Open interest was 1.51 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
