Hong Kong overtook Sydney as the
world’s second-most expensive city to lease shopping space after
rents in the Chinese city surged 46 percent in the first quarter
from the previous three months, according to  CB Richard Ellis
Group Inc. (CBG)   New York remains the world’s most expensive shopping
district with average annual retail rents of $1,900 a square
foot, the Los Angeles-based real estate brokerage said in an e-
mailed press release today. It is followed by $1,697 in Hong
Kong, which moved up from third place in the fourth quarter, and
$1,301 in Sydney.  London  is fourth with $909.  Increased spending by cashed-up Chinese tourists and the
addition of new shopping venues have driven up prime street shop
rents in Hong Kong, a former British colony returned to Chinese
rule in 1997. Chinese tourists visiting Hong Kong jumped 26
percent to 22.7 million in 2010 from a year earlier, according
to the city’s tourism board. The figure reached a daily record
of 122,893 on April 30 this year, according to the organization.  Cities in the Asia-Pacific region occupy eight out of the
top 20 spots in the survey, including sixth-place Tokyo and
10th-place  Melbourne . Three mainland Chinese cities, Guangzhou,
Beijing and Shanghai, also made it to the top 20.  “Economic growth continues to be strong in  Latin America 
and the Asia Pacific, but is much weaker in Europe and  North
America ,” Ray Torto, global chief economist at CB Richard
Ellis, said in the release.  Average rents in the Asia-Pacific region grew 11.1 percent
in the first quarter from a year earlier, the company said. They
were trailed by the 6.9 percent increase in the Americas and 0.5
percent growth in Europe,  Middle East  and Africa.  To contact the reporter for this story:
