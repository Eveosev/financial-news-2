Ecuador’s Economic Policy Minister
Katiuska King said the South American nation’s use of the  U.S.
dollar  as its official currency makes the economy “vulnerable”
to international economic crises.  Dollarization limits the government’s tools to offset
declining remittances from immigrants in  Europe  and the U.S.,
King said today in an e-mailed statement. The government is
revising strategies to “face and alleviate” the impacts of the
global financial crisis on the nation’s economy, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
