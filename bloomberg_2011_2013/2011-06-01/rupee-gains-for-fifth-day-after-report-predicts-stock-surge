India ’s rupee gained for a fifth day,
its longest winning streak in eight weeks, after a report
predicted the nation’s benchmark stock index will advance.  Indian stocks climbed for a second day after Morgan Stanley
said in a research note released yesterday that equities would
rally 19 percent by the end of the year. Overseas investors
bought $26 million more Indian shares than they sold on May 30,
exchange data show.  “There have been some inflows” into stocks, said J. Moses Harding, a Mumbai-based executive vice president at IndusInd
Bank Ltd. “The currency’s strong track record of appreciation
in recent years will help attract investors.”  The rupee strengthened 0.5 percent to 44.84 per dollar as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 44.77 earlier, the strongest level since
May 12. The currency has advanced in each except one of the last
five years.  The Bombay Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index will climb to
22,100 by year-end due to attractive valuations, Morgan Stanley
analysts led by Mumbai-based India Managing Director Ridham
Desai wrote in the report. The index advanced 0.6 percent to
18,608.81 today.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.46 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.65
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
