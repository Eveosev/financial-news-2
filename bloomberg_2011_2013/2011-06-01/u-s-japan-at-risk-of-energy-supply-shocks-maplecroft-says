Group of Seven member nations except
 Canada  are at “high risk” of interruptions to energy supply
and price fluctuations, analysts at Maplecroft said.  Political upheaval in the  Middle East  and the earthquake in
March in Japan highlight short-term supply risks for those
countries, the Bath, England-based company said in a statement.
Maplecroft defines short term as days to months.  Rising fuel prices in response to the political turmoil in
the Middle East and North Africa this year shown that “energy
security is of paramount importance,” said Alyson Warhurst,
Maplecroft’s chief executive officer. G-7 members include the
U.S, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the U.K.  Canada is at low-risk because of its natural resources and
the diversity of supply, the report said. Other low-risk
countries include  Australia , Malaysia, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi
Arabia and Norway, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
