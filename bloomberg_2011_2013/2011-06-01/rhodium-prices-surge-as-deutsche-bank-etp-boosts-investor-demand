Rhodium prices have surged 21 percent
since May 24 as the introduction of a physically backed
exchange-traded product boosted demand for the metal.  Deutsche Bank AG listed the DB Physical Rhodium product on
the  London  Stock Exchange on May 24. In the first four months of
the year, prices slumped 6.2 percent on signs supplies would
outpace demand. The metal rebounded 3.3 percent in May, the
biggest monthly gain since December, as prices rallied 12
percent in the last week of trading.  “It’s an extremely thin market, and an ETF would do
nothing but add to the upside,” said  Frank McGhee , the head
dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago .  Demand climbed 22 percent to 873,000 ounces last year,
halving the metal’s surplus to 114,000 ounces, Johnson Matthey
said on May 16. The metal is mainly used in car pollution-
control devices and also in the chemical and glass industries.  Rhodium for immediate delivery was unchanged at $2,350 an
ounce at 10:05 p.m. in London, according to data from Johnson
Matthey on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
