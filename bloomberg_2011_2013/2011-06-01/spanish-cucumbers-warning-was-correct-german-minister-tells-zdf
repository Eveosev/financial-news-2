Germany ’s warning about eating
Spanish cucumbers amid the E.coli outbreak was correct, Consumer
Affairs Minister  Ilse Aigner  said in an interview with
television station  ZDF  today.  “EHEC was indeed found on Spanish cucumbers,” and
therefore under European rules, authorities needed to issue a
warning as fast as possible, she said in the interview.  EHEC stands for enterohemorrhagic E.coli bacteria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
