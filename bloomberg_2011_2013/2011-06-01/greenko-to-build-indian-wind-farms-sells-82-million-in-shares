Greenko Group Plc (GKO) , a U.K. developer
of clean-energy plants in India, said it won concessions to
build wind farms with a combined potential of 650 megawatts,
increasing its total portfolio of wind assets to 1,015
megawatts, according to a filing today from the Isle of Man-
based company.  The developer said it began a partnership with  General
Electric Co. (GE)  to carry out the projects and signed a memorandum
of understanding for GE to supply, install, erect and maintain
its XLE 1.6-megawatt turbines.  Greenko also raised 50 million pounds ($82 million) selling
22.22 million new shares with new and existing investors at 225
pence a share, below its 235.25 pence closing price yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
