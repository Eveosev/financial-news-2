Daimler AG (DAI)  is considering a
partnership with  Robert Bosch GmbH  in batteries for electric and
hybrid vehicles, in addition to an existing joint venture with
Evonik Industries AG,  Handelsblatt  said, citing an interview
with board member Thomas Weber.  Daimler is evaluating expanding its battery production
capacity in Kamenz,  Germany , which is scheduled to start “in a
few weeks,” while the carmaker has not yet decided if extra
capacity will be added in Kamenz or abroad, the newspaper cited
Weber as saying.  Daimler may also cooperate more closely with  Renault SA (RNO)  on
batteries, Weber said, according to the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
