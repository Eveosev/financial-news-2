Bank of Spain Chief Economist Jose Luis Malo de Molina said  Greece  should stick to its debt plan,
as he backed the  European Central Bank ’s opposition to a
restructuring of that nation’s loans.  Asked about the possibility of getting lenders to roll over
expiring Greek bonds in an adaptation of what was done in
Eastern  Europe  two years ago, or a soft restructuring, Malo de
Molina said Greece already has measures in place to tackle its
surging debt.  “Don’t expect from me a position different to that of the
ECB, which has always been in favor of a solution in Greece on
the lines already established by the euro group,” Malo de
Molina said in an interview at a real-estate conference in
 Madrid  today.  Saddled with Europe’s heaviest debt load, Greece is seeking
additional loans on top of last year’s 110 billion-euro ($158
billion) European-Union led bailout. Olli Rehn, the EU’s
economic and monetary affairs commissioner, said in an interview
yesterday that the Vienna Initiative for Eastern Europe has
“mostly given us positive lessons,” while so-called re-
profiling is being considered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
