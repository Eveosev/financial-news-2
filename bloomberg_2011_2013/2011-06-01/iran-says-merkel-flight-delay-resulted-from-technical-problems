The Iranian Foreign Ministry denied
that  Iran  blocked the passage of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s plane’s over the Persian Gulf country en route to India
and said technical failure caused the delay.  Merkel’s plane, a new Airbus A340 with a full delegation,
was forced to circle over Turkish territory for about two hours
yesterday after Iran initially refused to let it enter. The
German government said here was no explanation as to why the
government in Tehran blocked entry after it had previously
granted overflight permission.  Permission for the airplane to enter Iranian airspace “was
issued on time” and “technical problems” led to the delay,
 Ramin Mehmanparast , a spokesman at Iranian Foreign Ministry,
said yesterday, according to the state-run satellite news
channel,  Press TV .  To contact the reporter on this story:
