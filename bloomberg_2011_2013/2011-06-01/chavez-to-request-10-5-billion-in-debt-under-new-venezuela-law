Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said
he will send a request to the National Assembly today to issue
up to 45 billion bolivars ($10.5 billion) in new bonds this year
as part of a special debt law.  Of the total, 20 billion bolivars would help pay for
153,000 homes as part of a housing drive, 10 billion bolivars
would go to a new job creation program, 10 billion to cover
public debt and 5 billion to respond to heavy rains that have
damaged homes and infrastructure, Chavez said.  “Just for the housing mission this year and next we need
almost 100 billion bolivars,” Chavez said, speaking yesterday
on state television. “That’s why we need to seek more
resources.” He didn’t give further details, including whether
any part of the new debt would be issued in dollars.  Chavez has made resolving the country’s 2 million unit
housing deficit a top priority heading into presidential
elections next year as he attempts to extend his 12-year rule
with another six-year term. The government plans to build
150,000 homes this year and 2 million by 2017. Heavy rains in
December destroyed homes and drove about 130,000 people into
government shelters, including the presidential palace.  Venezuela ’s central bank lowered  reserve requirements  by 3
percentage points to 14 percent, freeing up 10 billion bolivars
for banks to finance housing projects, bank president Nelson
Merentes said May 3. Chavez said April 30 he may ask private
banks to lend up to 20 billion bolivars to fund housing
construction projects.  Venezuela last year boosted the debt it would sell in 2011
by 53 percent to 54 billion bolivars from 35.2 billion in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
