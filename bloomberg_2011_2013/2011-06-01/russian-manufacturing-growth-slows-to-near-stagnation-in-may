Russian manufacturing growth slowed
for a second month in May to just above stagnation as domestic
demand declined.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to a seasonally
adjusted 50.7, from 52.1 in April, HSBC Holdings Plc said in a
 report  today, citing data compiled by  Markit Economics , a
financial information services company. The survey-based index
indicates a contraction when below 50 and growth with a figure
above 50.  “Russian manufacturing has almost lost growth momentum,”
 Alexander Morozov , HSBC’s chief economist for  Russia  and the
Commonwealth of Independent States, said in the report. “This
must reflect a decline in domestic demand, which has led to
stocks accumulation for the first time since the 2008 economic
crisis.”  The data suggest “negative surprises” for May industrial
production data, Morozov said, adding to concerns that the
economy’s recovery has been uneven. Bank Rossii this week
signaled it would stop raising  interest rates  because risks to
the economy, including slowing industrial output, were now even
with dangers from inflation.  The index has fallen 4.9 percentage points from March’s 55-
month high of 55.6 percent, the largest constant drop since late
2008, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
