Soccer’s governing body voted against
delaying today’s presidential election because of a corruption
probe.  Delegates at FIFA’s congress, meeting today in Zurich,
voted 172 to 17 against a proposal made by  England ’s Football
Association to postpone the election. Another 17 delegates
abstained.  President Sepp Blatter is running unopposed for a fourth
term after Mohamed Bin Hammam withdrew. Bin Hammam and another
executive, Jack Warner, deny wrongdoing after they were
suspended in a corruption investigation.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
