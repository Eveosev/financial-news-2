The premium for spot gasoline climbed
to a 31-month high in  Chicago  amid supply disruptions at
Marathon Oil Corp. and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Illinois refineries.  The premium for 87-grade conventional gasoline in Chicago
versus July futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  widened
5.5 cents to 42.5 cents as of 2:34 p.m. The spread is the
highest since Oct. 14, 2008. The price for prompt delivery fell
2.33 cents to $3.397.  In the Midwest, the gain was fueled by speculation that the
catalytic cracker shutdown at Exxon’s Joliet refinery will last
two weeks, said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston.  The cracker is expected to remain shut until at least next
week, a person with knowledge of the situation said May 27.
Joliet is 40 miles (65 kilometers) west of Chicago.  “Nothing new to report,” Kevin Allexon, a spokesman for
Exxon based in Fairfax, Virginia, said today in an e-mail. He
has declined to give more details or say whether any units had
been shut.  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)  said May 29 it was working to restart
its Robinson refinery after a power loss May 25.  The discount for the fuel in the Midcontinent narrowed 2.25
cents to 0.25 cents a gallon. The prompt price fell 15.59 cents
to $2.9695. In the Gulf Coast market, the 87-grade gasoline
discount narrowed 1.5 cents to 13 cents and the prompt price
fell 4.93 cents to $2.856.  To contact the reporter on this story:
