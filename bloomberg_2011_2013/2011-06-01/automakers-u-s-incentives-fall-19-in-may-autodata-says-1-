Automakers reduced spending on
incentives for U.S. customers in May by 19 percent to an average
$2,303 per vehicle, the lowest in more than half a decade,
according to Autodata Corp.  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s average spending on discounts and
promotions declined 20 percent from a year earlier to $2,432,
the  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based researcher said yesterday.
 General Motors Co. (GM)  reduced incentives by $648, or 17 percent
from a year earlier, to an estimated $3,085 per vehicle.
Chrysler Group LLC lowered spending 18 percent to $3,002.  Industrywide light-vehicle sales ran at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 11.8 million in May, Autodata said, the
lowest since September and trailing the 12.1 million pace that
was the average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said “dramatic” cuts to
incentives led some buyers to defer purchases during the month.  “There was a mentality in the industry that you didn’t
want to be the one outlier spending at normal levels when
everyone else was cutting,” said  Jesse Toprak , vice president
of industry trends at TrueCar.com. “Everybody sort of cut in
harmony, and the end result was poor retail sales.”  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest automaker, reduced
spending $515, or 27 percent, to an estimated $1,408 per unit,
Autodata said. Honda Motor Co., the second-largest Japanese
automaker by U.S. sales, lowered incentives to $1,513, 29
percent less than a year earlier. Nissan Motor Co. reduced
discounts by 28 percent to $2,247.  The last time industrywide average incentive spending was
lower was October 2005 at $2,204 per unit, David Lucas, an
analyst for Autodata, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
