Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s
biggest automaker, plans to increase pay to directors and
corporate auditors by 12 percent on average for the year ended
March 31.   Toyota plans to pay a combined 1.549 billion yen ($19
million) to its 38 directors and auditors, according to a
document sent to shareholders on May 30. The automaker also
intends to give a bonus for the first time in three fiscal years,
said  Shiori Hashimoto , a Toyota spokeswoman. The payouts need
shareholder approval at an annual meeting on June 17.  The planned salary increases follow production recovery at
the Toyota City, Japan-based carmaker after a record earthquake
and tsunami in the nation on March 11 crippled output. Toyota
cut overall salaries for directors and auditors by 20 percent
last fiscal year because of costs to recall more than 8 million
vehicles worldwide for defects relating to unintended
acceleration.  The proposed overall salary for the last fiscal year
translates to an average 40.76 million yen for each recipient.
Toyota plans to pay a combined bonus of 340 million yen to 27
directors and also offer stock options worth a total of 616
million yen to 31 directors, the document showed.  Toyota fell 0.6 percent to close at 3,380 yen in Tokyo
trading today. The stock has advanced 5.1 percent this year.  Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-largest carmaker, plans to
pay a combined 781 million yen to its directors and auditors,
according to a document sent to shareholders on May 30. The
automaker also intends to give a bonus of 372 million yen. The
payouts need shareholder approval at an annual meeting on June
23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
