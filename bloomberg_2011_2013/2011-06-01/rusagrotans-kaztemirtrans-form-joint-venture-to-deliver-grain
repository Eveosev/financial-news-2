Rusagrotrans ,  Russia ’s largest rail

 Kazakhstan  signed an agreement today forming a joint venture to
distribute grains.  The joint venture will handle between 8 million to 9
million metric tons a year, Rusagrotrans Deputy Chief Executive
Officer Oleg Rogachev said by phone today from Sochi, in
southern Russia. The capital will exceed $90 million in rail
cars and cash shared equally between the partners, according to
