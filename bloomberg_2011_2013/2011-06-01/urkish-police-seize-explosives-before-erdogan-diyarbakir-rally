Turkish police seized explosives in
Diyarbakir, the main city in the largely Kurdish southeast,
where Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  is holding an election
rally today.  Police found dozens of Molotov cocktails and “plenty” of
materials to prepare handmade bombs, the city’s governorship
said today in a  statement . The Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK,
which has been fighting for autonomy in the southeast for more
than two decades, planned to attack targets including election
bureaus and government buildings, the governorship said.  A small explosive device was thrown near the square where
Erdogan’s rally will be held, though there were no reports of
injuries, the state-run Anatolia news agency said.  Erdogan is seeking a third term as prime minister and his
 Justice and Development Party  heads opinion polls in the run-up
to the June 12 elections. It may win 51 percent of votes, to 26
percent for the  Republican People’s Party  and 12.5 percent for
the Nationalist Action Party, according to a poll published
yesterday by Sonar Arastirma.  Erdogan’s main rival in the southeast is the pro-Kurdish
Peace and Democracy Party, which organized a rally of hundreds
of cars in Diyarbakir today before the premier’s visit, with
participants chanting slogans in support of the PKK, Milliyet
newspaper  reported .  To contact the reporter on this story:
