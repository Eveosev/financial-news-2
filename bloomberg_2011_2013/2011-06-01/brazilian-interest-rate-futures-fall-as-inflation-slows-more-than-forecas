Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts fell for a sixth day after inflation
decelerated more than analysts forecast in May, reducing bets
for how much the central bank will raise borrowing costs.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2013 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 12.47 percent at 5
p.m. New York time. The six consecutive days of declines in the
yield is the longest streak since the period ended Aug. 16. The
real posted its first decline in five days.  Consumer prices, as measured by the IPC-S index, rose 0.51
percent in the 30-day period ended May 31, compared with a 0.96
percent increase in the period ending May 22, the Getulio Vargas
Foundation said today. The median forecast of 17 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was 0.65 percent. Central bank President
Alexandre Tombini told lawmakers on May 5 that inflation began
slowing last month to levels in line with the government’s 4.5
percent target.  “There was a strong retreat in gasoline prices and also a
deceleration in food prices,” said  Andre Perfeito , chief
economist at Sao Paulo-based Gradual Investimentos. “The
central bank’s forecast is being clearly confirmed,” he said in
a telephone interview.  The real fell the most in more than two weeks, weakening
0.9 percent to 1.5942 per dollar, from 1.5801 yesterday, as
prices for Brazil’s commodity exports dropped and a report
showed companies in the U.S. hired fewer workers last month than
forecast.  ‘Slowdown’  “Brazilians are afraid of a slowdown,” Alfredo Barbutti,
an economist at Liquidez DTVM Ltda in Sao Paulo, said by phone.
They are concerned, in part, because weaker global growth may
cause commodities to decline, hurting the economy in Brazil, he
said.  Prices for oil, sugar and coffee all fell in New York
trading.  Brazil  is the world’s biggest exporter of sugar and
coffee.  U.S. employment rose by 38,000 last month, the smallest
increase since September, from a revised 177,000 in April,
according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The median
estimate in the Bloomberg survey called for a 175,000 advance
for May.  The central bank said today it twice purchased dollars in
the  spot market , first at 1.5854 reais and then 1.5885 each. The
bank also said today it had bought more than $34 billion worth
of the U.S. currency this year through May 27. Policy makers use
the tactic to try to curb appreciation in the real, which has
strengthened 22 percent in the past two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
