Natural gas shipments to U.S. power
plants were set to decline for the first time in three days as
nuclear production increased. Deliveries to  Texas  rose to a
three-month high as hot weather boosted demand.  A sample of scheduled gas shipments for U.S. electricity
generation dropped 1.7 percent to 19.1 million dekatherms (18.6
billion cubic feet) from yesterday’s 19.4 million, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg as of 2:45 p.m. in  New York .  U.S. nuclear-power production nationwide increased by 825
megawatts from yesterday to 82,007 megawatts, or 81 percent of
capacity, according to the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  and
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gas deliveries to Texas power plants increased for a third
day, up 1.6 percent to 3.34 million dekatherms, the highest
level since Feb. 10.  Temperatures will be above normal in the state through June
15, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
Maryland. The high temperature in Houston tomorrow may be 94
degrees Fahrenheit (34 Celsius), 5 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Wholesale natural gas at Katy, Texas, slid 0.7 percent to
$4.5694 per million British thermal units on the
Intercontinental Exchange as of 1:59 p.m. New York time after
yesterday’s 7.9 percent rally. The hub is 27 miles (43
kilometers) west of Houston.  To contact the reporter on this story:
