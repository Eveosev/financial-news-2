Canadian natural gas fell after the
U.S. Energy Department said March production rose to a record,
easing concern that hot weather will stoke demand for gas-fired
power generation.  U.S. natural gas production rose 3.3 percent in March to
77.83 billion cubic feet a day, the Energy Department said in a
report yesterday. February output was 75.33 billion a day, the
report said. Gas at  Canada ’s benchmark AECO C hub in  Alberta 
gained 1 percent last month as hot weather in the U.S. South and
cold in the North boosted demand.  “The March EIA production number was higher than we
expected,” said  Stephen Smith , an energy analyst and president
of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in Natchez,  Mississippi .  Alberta gas for July delivery fell 4.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to C$3.92 per gigajoule ($3.83 per million British
thermal units) as of 10:45 a.m. New York time, according to  NGX, 
a Canadian Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange is
shipped to users in Canada and the U.S., and is priced on
TransCanada’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for July delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange fell 4.3 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $4.623 per million
Btu as of 11:23 a.m.  Volume on  TransCanada Corp.’s  Alberta system, which
collects the output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.9
billion cubic feet as of 10 a.m. in New York, 41 million below
target.  Gas Flow  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.88 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.95 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 881 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.42 billion cubic feet today, about 62 percent of its
capacity of 2.3 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to  Vancouver  and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.05
billion cubic feet at 10:05 a.m. Spectra warned shippers not to
add extra gas to the line because of high volumes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
