Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said companies are fixing disruptions in their supply
chains at a faster pace than expected as they rush to repair
their facilities after a record earthquake and tsunami.  Supply constraints are “being relaxed more quickly than
expected initially as a result of strenuous efforts by firms,”
Shirakawa said today at an international conference at the
bank’s headquarters in  Tokyo . “As supply-side constraints ease
and production regains traction, the economy is expected to
return to the moderate recovery path from the second half of
fiscal 2011,” he said, referring to the year ending March.  Japanese manufacturers said they plan to increase
production 8 percent in May and 7.7 percent in June, evidence
that the economy may resume growing after the March 11 quake
pushed the country into its third recession in a decade last
quarter. Toyota Motor Corp. said today that its domestic output
will recover to 90 percent of normal levels this month as the
world’s largest automaker gains access to more parts.  For now,  Japan ’s economy remains under “strong downward
pressure” and a deterioration in sentiment has weakened demand
at home, Shirakawa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
