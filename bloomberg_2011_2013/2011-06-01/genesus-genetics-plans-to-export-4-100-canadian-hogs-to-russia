Genesus Genetics Inc., a Canadian
swine-breeding and exporting company, agreed to ship 4,100 live
pigs to  Russia  in a deal valued at more than C$5 million ($5.15
million), according to Agriculture and Agri-Food  Canada .  The contract, which was signed two weeks ago and announced

registered purebred pigs, Genesus Genetics Chief Executive

from Canada were valued at C$26 million over the last three
years, according to a statement today from Agriculture and Agri-
