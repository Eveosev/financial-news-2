BP Plc (BP/)  exceeded the 20 percent
opacity limit on a unit related to a fluid catalytic cracker at
its Texas City, Texas, refinery, according to a filing with
state regulators.  Emissions associated with the event started at 4:11 p.m.
local time yesterday and lasted for 24 hours, the London-based
company said in the  filing  with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality. Workers were trying to identify the cause
and a solution, according to the  filing .  Outages can increase prices for refined products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil as less feedstock is used.  Scott Dean , a company spokesman based in  Chicago , didnâ€™t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  The plant receives about 70 percent of its crude oil via
marine terminal and sends out approximately 75 percent of its
products through pipeline, according to the company  website .  The plant, 42 miles (68 kilometers) southeast of Houston,
has a capacity of 475,000 barrels a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
