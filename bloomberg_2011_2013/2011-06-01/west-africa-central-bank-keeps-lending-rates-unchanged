The Central Bank of West African
States kept its key lending rates unchanged today.  The marginal lending facility rate was held at 4.25 percent,
the minimum open market rate at 3.25 percent and the bank
reserves requirement at 7 percent, the Dakar-based bank’s
Monetary Policy Committee said in an e-mailed statement.  Inflation in the eight-member West African Economic and
Monetary Union, which oversees the central bank, accelerated to
3.9 percent in March from 3.7 percent a month earlier, the
statement said.  The central bank must ensure it curbs price pressures to
help sustain economic growth in the region, Vice Governor Jean- Baptiste Compaore said today before the committee meeting.  The bank decided not to change rates at its last meeting in
March to gauge the impact on the regional economy from a post-
election crisis in  Ivory Coast .  Laurent Gbagbo , who ruled the world’s top cocoa producer
for a decade, refused to cede power to  Alassane Ouattara  after
the November vote. He was captured in Abidjan on April 11 and
Ouattara was sworn in on May 21.  The inflation rate in Ivory Coast, which Compaore called the
“economic engine” of the region, rose to 5.8 percent in March
from 5.1 percent in February, the economic union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
