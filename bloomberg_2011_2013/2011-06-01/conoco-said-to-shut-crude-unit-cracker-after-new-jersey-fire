ConocoPhillips (COP)  shut a crude unit at
its Bayway refinery in Linden, New Jersey, after a fire, a
company spokesman said.  An injured worker was taken to the hospital after the fire,
which has been extinguished,  Rich Johnson , the spokesman, said
in an e-mail. The fire occurred at 1:50 p.m. local time.  The fluid catalytic cracker has also been shut at Bayway,
according to a person with knowledge of the plant’s operations
who declined to be identified. The person said the injured
worker was severely burned in the fire.  Johnson didn’t mention the status of the catalytic cracker
in his e-mail.  Crude units, also known as pipestills, separate oil into
components according to their boiling points. Cat crackers are
gasoline-making units. The refinery has a capacity of 250,000
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
