Oil declined from near the highest in
three weeks on concern demand in the U.S. may falter following a
report showing that U.S. companies added fewer jobs than
forecast last month.  Futures fell as much as 0.8 percent after figures from ADP
Employer Services showed companies in the U.S. added 38,000
workers to payrolls in May, compared with a median estimate of
175,000 in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The most obvious signs that high prices are having direct
impact are coming from  North America ,”  David Fyfe , head of the
 International Energy Agency ’s oil industry and markets division,
said in an interview today. “The longer that prices stay high,
the more likely they’ll drag on underlying economic growth.”  Crude for July delivery fell as much as 80 cents to $101.90
and was at $102.12 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:58 p.m. London time. Prices
climbed $2.11 to $102.70 yesterday, the highest since May 10,
and slipped 9.9 percent in May, the first drop in nine months.  Brent crude  for July delivery was down 70 cents at $116.03
a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
contract yesterday increased $2.05, or 1.8 percent, to $116.73.
The European benchmark slid 7.3 percent in May and is 60 percent
higher in the past year.  Inventory Report  An Energy Department report tomorrow may show U.S. crude
stockpiles declined 1.8 million barrels last week from 370.9
million, a Bloomberg News survey of analysts shows. Refiners are
expected to raise output by 0.5 percentage point to 86.8 percent
of capacity as they ramp up gasoline production for the summer
demand season.  Motor fuel supplies probably increased 650,000 barrels, the
survey shows. Gasoline consumption peaks between Memorial Day,
which this year fell on May 30, and Labor Day in early
September, when Americans traditionally take vacations.  Inventories of distillates, a category that includes
heating oil and diesel, were probably unchanged at 141.1 million
barrels, according to the median estimate in the survey.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  will
release its weekly data today.  Oil tanks at Cushing,  Oklahoma , were at 86 percent of
working storage capacity as of the end of March, the Energy
Department said yesterday. It’s the first time the department
has published a utilization figure for the delivery point for
the West Texas Intermediate grade, said  Jonathan Cogan , a
spokesman for the department’s Energy Information
Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
