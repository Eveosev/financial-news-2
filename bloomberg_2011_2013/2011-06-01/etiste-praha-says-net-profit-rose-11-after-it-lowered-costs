Letiste Praha AS, the operator of
 Prague ’s largest airport, said its 2010 profit rose 11 percent
after the company cut costs.  Net income jumped to 991 million koruna ($58.2 million)
from 891 million a year earlier, Letiste Praha said today in a
statement handed to reporters after a press conference in
Prague. Revenue declined 3 percent to 5.59 billion koruna.  The Czech government decided in November to merge Letiste
Praha and the unprofitable Ceske Aerolinie AS into a joint
company called Cesky Aeroholding AS to cut the airline’s costs
and overhaul it before a planned sale in 2012. The government
already scrapped the sale of the carrier in 2009 after it
receiving a sole bid for CSA from Unimex Group and private
carrier Travel Service.  Letiste handled 4.22 million passengers in the first five
months, up 5.3 percent from a year ago. It expects to carry
about 12 million passengers in 2010, between 3 to 4 percent more
than a year ago, it said today.  Letiste estimates it lost about 70 million koruna after the
eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajökull volcano in April
disrupted travel and grounded flights.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
