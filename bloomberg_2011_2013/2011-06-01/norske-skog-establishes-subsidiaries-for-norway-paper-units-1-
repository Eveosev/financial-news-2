Norske Skogindustrier ASA (NSG)  said it
will separate out paper making activities at Skogn, Saugbrugs
and Follum into new wholly-owned subsidiaries.  The transfer will be “conducted as assets sales, and the
transactions will not have any impact on the consolidated
financial statements,” the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
