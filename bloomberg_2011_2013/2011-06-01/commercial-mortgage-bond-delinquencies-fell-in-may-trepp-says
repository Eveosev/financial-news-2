Late payments on commercial mortgages
bundled and sold as bonds fell five basis points to 9.60 percent
in May, according to Trepp LLC.  The decline follows a jump of 23 basis points the prior
month, the largest increase since late 2010, the research firm
said in a report today.  The value of delinquent loans is $61.5 billion, according
to Trepp.  “While there may be additional bumps along the way, we
think the May numbers accurately reflect a leveling off in the
market,” Manus Clancy, a managing director at Trepp, said in
the report.  A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
