The World Baseball Classic will add a
qualifying round and 12 countries to the 2013 tournament.  The 16-team qualifying round will feature the four nations
that didn’t win a game in the 2009 edition plus the dozen new
entries including  Israel , Spain, Brazil and the Czech Republic,
the tournament’s organizers said today in an e-mailed release.  “The expansion of the World Baseball Classic from 16 to 28
teams is a testament to the sport’s continuing growth in
participation and popularity around the world,” Michael Weiner,
executive director for the  Major League Baseball Players
Association , said in the release.  The qualifying round will take place in 2012, with the four
group winners joining the 12 automatic qualifiers in the World
Baseball Classic, scheduled for March 2013. Venues and groupings
for the qualifying round, which will be based on competitive
balance and regional rivalries, haven’t been determined,
according to the release.  Japan won the first two tournaments, in 2006 and 2009. The
 United States ’ best finish was fourth, in 2009.
