Two-year Greek notes rose for a third
day, pushing yields down to the lowest in more than two weeks,
amid growing optimism European policy makers will reach a deal
on additional aid to prevent the nation defaulting.  German two-year government notes fell for a third day as
demand for the region’s safest assets waned. Governments are
ruling out a restructuring of  Greece ’s debt under aid plans to
be worked out by June 20, European Union Commissioner Olli Rehn
said today. European Central Bank policy makers may back a plan
to roll over Greek bonds, said two officials familiar with the
situation. Portugal’s  government bonds  slid as the nation’s
borrowing costs rose at a three-month bill auction.  “We had some positive comments around Greece and this has
made the market hope that there could be a solution,” said
Niels From, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB in Copenhagen.
“This is helping peripherals and weighing on bunds. Given the
massive rally we’ve seen in bunds, as we get closer to something
that may be a solution, people want to sell.”  Greek two-year notes advanced, pushing the yield down 46
basis points to 24.55 percent at 4:26 p.m. in  London , after
touching 24.53 the least since May 17. The yield fell below 25
percent for a second day, having been above that level for six
days between May 23 and May 30. The 4.6 percent security due May
2013 rose 0.60 or 6.0 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,444) face amount,
to 71.64. The nation’s 10-year bond yield rose 12 basis points
to 16.16 percent.  Greek Loans  Saddled with Europe’s heaviest debt load, Greece is seeking
additional loans after last year’s 110 billion-euro European-led
package was insufficient to plug its fiscal hole. European
officials preparing the second bailout may offer bondholders
incentives to roll over maturing debt without triggering a
credit-rating downgrade that would roil  Europe ’s banking system,
two people with knowledge of the talks said.  Two-year German note yields were little changed at 1.61
percent, after reaching 1.65 percent earlier. The 10-year bund
yield fell three basis points to 2.99 percent. Earlier, it rose
to 3.07 percent.  German bonds rose in May, pushing the 10-year yield down 20
basis points, as concern that Greece may restructure its debt
burden boosted demand for the safest assets.  Bunds stayed lower today even as a report showed European
manufacturing growth slowed more than initially estimated in
May, adding to signs the region’s recovery is losing momentum.  European Data  A gauge of manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area slipped
to 54.6 from 58 in April, a report showed today. That’s below an
initial estimate of 54.8 released on May 23. A reading above 50
indicates growth.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield rose 15 basis points to 9.76
percent, while two-year note yields climbed 45 basis points to
11.39 percent.  The nation sold 850 million euros of 112-day bills. The
securities due in September were issued at an average yield of
4.967 percent, the country’s IGCP debt-management agency said,
up from the average yield of 4.652 percent at a previous auction
of three-month bills on May 4. The auction attracted bids for
2.7 times the amount offered, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio
of 1.9 in last month’s sale.  On May 26, the IGCP said the so-called total indicative
amount for today’s auction was between 750 million euros and 1
billion euros.  French Auction  “The debt agency probably stopped the auction at 850
million to avoid the cost of funding breaking above 5 percent,”
said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at
UniCredit SpA in Milan.  French 10-year yields fell five basis points to 3.34
percent as the nation sold 8.4 billion euros of bonds maturing
in 2018, 2021 and 2023. It sold 5 billion euros of 3.25 percent
bonds maturing in October 2021 at an average yield of 3.5
percent, compared with 3.64 percent at last month’s sale of
similar-maturity securities. Investors bid for 2.54 times the
securities on offer, down from 3.34 times at the similar sale on
May 5.  Government bonds from  Germany  have returned nothing this
year, indexes compiled by the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies and Bloomberg show, while Treasuries have
handed investors a 2.7 percent gain. Greek debt has lost 12
percent, while Portugal’s has lost 14 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
