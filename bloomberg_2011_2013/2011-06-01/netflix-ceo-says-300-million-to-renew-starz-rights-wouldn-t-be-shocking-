Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  Chief Executive Officer
Reed Hastings said it “wouldn’t be shocking” to pay as much as
$300 million a year to renew a licensing agreement for movies
and TV shows with Liberty Media Corp.’s Starz unit  “We haven’t done a deal yet, so it’s hard to know,”
Hastings said today at the All Things D Conference in Rancho
Palos Verdes,  California , in response to suggestions Netflix may
pay $200 million to $300 million to renew the accord. Netflix
pays more every time it renews an agreement, he said.  Netflix, the film streaming and DVD rental service based in
 Los Gatos , California, signed a three-year deal with Starz in
2008 for original programs, and for movies from  Sony Corp. (6758)  and
 Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  Rich Greenfield, an analyst with BTIG LLC in  New
York , estimated in August 2010 that Netflix was paying $30
million annually under that agreement.  Netflix fell $1.18 to $269.62 at 1:14 p.m. New York time in
Nasdaq Market trading. The shares had risen 54 percent this year
before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
