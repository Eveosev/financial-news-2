Kevin McHale is returning to
coaching, taking over the  Houston Rockets  because he began to
“miss the competition,” he told  NBA.com .  McHale agreed to a three-year deal plus a team option, the
Houston Chronicle reported May 27. McHale beat out Boston
Celtics assistant coach Lawrence Frank and Dallas Mavericks
assistant Dwane Casey for the job, the newspaper said.  McHale, 53, a Hall of Fame player for the Celtics from
1980 to 1993, worked in the front office for the  Minnesota
Timberwolves  from 1995 to 2008 and spent parts of two seasons
as coach of the Timberwolves.  “I had really wanted to coach again,” McHale told
NBA.com yesterday. “You miss the competition when you’re away
from it. That’s what I missed the last couple of years. I’ve
done it my whole life.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
