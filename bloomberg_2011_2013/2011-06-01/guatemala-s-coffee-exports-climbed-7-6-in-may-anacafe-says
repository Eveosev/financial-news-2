Coffee exports from  Guatemala , the
largest producer in Central America, rose 7.6 percent last
month, according to the country’s National Coffee Association.  Shipments climbed to 465,277 bags from 432,216 bags a year
earlier,  Anacafe , as the association is known, said by e-mail
today. Each bag of coffee weighs of 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Exports for the marketing season that began Oct. 1 totaled
2.347 million bags, compared with 2.328 million bags in the
year-earlier period, data from the association showed.  Guatemala’s production will reach 4 million bags in the
2010-2011 marketing season, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
