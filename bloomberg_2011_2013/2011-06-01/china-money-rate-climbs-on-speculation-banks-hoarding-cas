China ’s money-market rate rose for a
second day on speculation banks are hoarding cash before a
public holiday next week.  Financial markets will be closed on June 6 for the Dragon
Boat holiday. China’s interest-rate swaps were unchanged after
data showed manufacturing growth slowed less than economists
expected. The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 52.0 in May,
from 52.9 in April, China’s logistics federation and the
statistics bureau said today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey was for a drop to 51.6.  “Companies might be holding on to cash before the
holiday,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist at
Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “Our view is the central bank
will raise  interest rates  this month to cool the economy further
after the less-than-expected fall in the PMI.”  The seven-day repurchase rate gained six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 3.91 percent as of 11:18 a.m. in
Shanghai, according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. That’s the highest level
since May 27.  One-year interest-rate swaps, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repo rate, were unchanged at 3.47
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.83 percent government bond due January
2018 was unchanged at 3.63 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center.  --Andrea Wong. Editors: Andrew Janes, Ven Ram  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
