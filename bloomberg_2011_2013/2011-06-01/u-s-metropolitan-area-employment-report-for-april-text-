The following is the text of the U.S.
metropolitan area employment report for April released by the
 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics :  Unemployment rates were lower in April than a year earlier
in 297 of the 372 metropolitan areas, higher in 54 areas, and
unchanged in 21 areas, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported today. Twelve areas recorded jobless rates of at least
15.0 percent, while 16 areas registered rates of less than 5.0
percent. Two hundred thirty-seven metropolitan areas reported
over-the-year increases in nonfarm payroll employment, 126
reported decreases, and 9 had no change. The national
unemployment rate in April was 8.7 percent, not seasonally
adjusted, down from 9.5 percent a year earlier.  Metropolitan Area Unemployment (Not Seasonally Adjusted)  In April, 74 metropolitan areas had jobless rates of at
least 10.0 percent, down from 127 areas a year earlier, while 92
areas had rates below 7.0 percent, up from 59 areas in April
2010. El Centro, Calif., recorded the highest unemployment rate
in April 2011, 27.9 percent, followed by Yuma, Ariz., 25.3
percent, and Yuba City, Calif., 20.2 percent. All of the
remaining nine areas with jobless rates of at least 15.0 percent
were located in  California . Bismarck, N.D., registered the
lowest unemployment rate, 2.9 percent. The areas with the next
lowest rates were Fargo, N.D.-Minn., and Lincoln, Neb., 3.7 and
3.8 percent, respectively. Of the 16 areas with jobless rates of
less than 5.0 percent, half were located in the West North
Central census division. A total of 224 areas had April
unemployment rates below the U.S. figure of 8.7 percent, 146
areas had rates above it, and 2 areas had rates equal to that of
the nation.  Elkhart-Goshen, Ind., registered the largest over-the-year
unemployment rate decrease in April (-4.0 percentage points). An
additional 11 areas recorded jobless rate decreases of 3.0
percentage points or more from a year earlier, and 36 other
areas had decreases between 2.0 and 2.9 points.  Baton Rouge , La.,
and Pascagoula, Miss., had the largest over-the-year jobless
rate increases (+1.2 percentage points each), followed by
Brownsville-Harlingen, Texas (+1.0 point).  Changes to Current Employment Statistics Data  With the release of preliminary April 2011 data, state and
area nonfarm employment estimates incorporate net business
birth/death adjustment factors estimated on a quarterly basis,
replacing the previous practice of estimating the factors
annually. This allows the state and area nonfarm employment
estimates to incorporate information from the Quarterly Census
of Employment and Wages     into the net birth/death adjustment
factors as soon as it becomes available and thereby improve the
factors.  In the 49 metropolitan areas with a Census 2000 population
of 1 million or more, the highest unemployment rates in April
were registered in Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, Calif.,
13.4 percent, Las Vegas-Paradise, Nev., 12.1 percent, and
Sacramento--Arden-Arcade--Roseville, Calif., 12.0 percent. Eight
additional large areas posted rates of 10.0 percent or more. The
lowest jobless rate among the large areas was recorded in
 Oklahoma City , Okla., 4.5 percent, followed by Washington-
Arlington-Alexandria, D.C.-Va.-Md.-W.Va., 5.4 percent. Forty-
three of the large areas reported over-the-year unemployment
rate decreases, while three areas registered rate increases and
three had no rate change. Las Vegas-Paradise, Nev., and Detroit-
Warren-Livonia, Mich., experienced the largest unemployment rate
decreases from April 2010 among the large areas (-3.0 and -2.9
percentage points, respectively). Two other large areas reported
rate decreases of at least 2.0 percentage points. The three
large areas with over-the-year jobless rate increases were New
Orleans-Metairie-Kenner, La. (+0.7 percentage point), Miami-Fort
Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, Fla. (+0.3 point), and  Memphis , Tenn.-
Miss.-Ark. (+0.2 point).  Metropolitan Division Unemployment (Not Seasonally Adjusted)  Eleven of the most populous metropolitan areas are made up
of 34 metropolitan divisions, which are essentially separately

Beach-Kendall, Fla., registered the highest jobless rate among
the divisions, 13.2 percent, while Nashua, N.H.-Mass., reported
the lowest division rate, 4.8 percent.  All but one of the metropolitan divisions recorded over-
the-year jobless rate decreases in April. The two divisions that

Livonia-Dearborn and Warren-Troy-Farmington Hills (-2.8

experienced the only over-the-year unemployment rate increase
among divisions (+1.4 percentage points).  In 6 of the 11 metropolitan areas that contain divisions,
the ranges between the highest and lowest division jobless rates
