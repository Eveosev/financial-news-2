Turkish police detained 18 people
suspected of planning attacks during a June 6 rally by the
Nationalist Action Party in the southeast, the  Sabah newspaper 
reported without saying where it got the information.  The group, which allegedly included seven party members, is
suspected of planning to recruit a gunman to open fire during an
election campaign rally by leader Devlet Bahceli, Sabah said.  An incident during a nationalist rally in the majority
Kurdish city could have increased support for the party and
enabled it to clear the 10 percent minimum threshold required to
enter parliament in the June 12 general elections, Sabah said,
citing taped conversations among the detainees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
