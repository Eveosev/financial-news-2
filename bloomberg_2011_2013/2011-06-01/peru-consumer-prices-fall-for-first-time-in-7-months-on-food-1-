Peruvian consumer prices fell for the
first time in seven months in May as food costs declined,
increasing the chance that the central bank will pause at its
meeting next week.  Prices fell 0.02 percent last month,  Peru ’s national
statistics agency said today in an e-mailed report. Analysts
expected a 0.19 percent rise, according to the median estimate
of 12 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey. Annual inflation slowed
to 3.07 percent in May from 3.34 percent in April.  Food prices fell for the first time in 2011 in May and have
eased from the three-year high reached in March. The combination
of slowing headline inflation and the cooling of  South America ’s
sixth-biggest economy will probably lead policy makers to keep
their benchmark rate unchanged this month after 10 increases at
their last 13 meetings, said  Mario Guerrero , an economist at
Scotiabank Peru.  “Chicken prices are falling from record levels as supply
returns to normal,” Guerrero said in a telephone interview from
 Lima . “There’ll be a little less pressure on the bank and the
 Finance Ministry  in the very short term.”  Policy makers have pushed the overnight rate up from a
record low of 1.25 percent to 4.25 percent since last April. The
bank targets inflation of 1 percent to 3 percent.  Gross domestic product rose 8.8 percent in the first
quarter from the same period a year earlier, the slowest pace in
the last year and down from 9.2 percent in the fourth quarter,
the statistics agency said yesterday.  Higher food costs and international grain prices pushed the
monthly inflation rate to a 33-month high of 0.7 percent in
March and monthly food inflation to 1.37 percent.  The Andean nation’s consumer price index is the second-most
exposed to food inflation among emerging markets, after the
 Philippines , according to the central bank. Food and drink
costs, which fell 0.1 percent in May, account for 38 percent of
the gauge.  The sol fell 0.4 percent to 2.7810 per dollar at 11 a.m.
