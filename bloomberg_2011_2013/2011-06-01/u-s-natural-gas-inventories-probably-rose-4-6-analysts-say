U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose by less than the seasonal average last week as hot weather
in the South and late-season heating needs in the North boosted
demand, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories rose 94 billion cubic feet, or 4.6 percent, to
2.118 trillion in the week ended May 27, based on the median of
six estimates. The five-year average stockpile increase for the
week is 99 billion, according to Energy Department data.
Supplies climbed 88 billion cubic feet a year earlier.  Highs in Atlanta touched 92 degrees Fahrenheit (33 Celsius)
May 25, about 10 degrees higher than normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. Heat boosts the need for gas-fired generators
to run air conditioners. Combined with lingering cool weather in
the North, the weekly storage increase probably lagged behind
normal levels, said Eric Bickel, a commodities analyst with
Summit Energy Services in Louisville,  Kentucky .  “When it’s hot, people ramp up the air conditioning and
that goes straight to the power generators,” said Bickel, who
estimated that stockpiles rose 94 billion cubic feet, which he
described as “relatively bullish compared to the five-year
average.”  The low in  Chicago  was 42 degrees Fahrenheit (6 Celsius)
May 27, 13 degrees below normal,  State College , Pennsylvania-
based forecaster AccuWeather said. Heating demand usually wanes
in May, allowing utilities to boost reserves of gas for winter
use.  Gas Rigs Rise  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 90 billion
to 110 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department is scheduled to
report inventory levels at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Gas drilling rigs rose by 15 to 881 last week, the first
weekly increase in three, according to data from Houston-based
Baker Hughes Inc. The rig count has dropped 11 percent from 992
on Aug. 13, the highest level of 2010.  U.S. nuclear-power production rose last week to 82,810
megawatts, or 82 percent of capacity, on May 27, according to a
Nuclear Regulatory Commission report and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Lower nuclear output can boost gas demand from  power
plants .  Nuclear units typically shut for refueling and maintenance
in the spring and fall, when power demand is lowest. Nuclear
power output nationwide fell to 68,248 megawatts on May 2, the
smallest amount since May 10, 1999.  Gas stockpiles rose 105 billion cubic feet to 2.024
trillion in the week ended May 20, the Energy Department
reported last week. Analysts expected an increase of 95 billion.  Gas on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  rose 5.3 percent
last week to $4.518 per million British thermal units. Prices
rose 14.8 cents to settle at $4.666 yesterday on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
