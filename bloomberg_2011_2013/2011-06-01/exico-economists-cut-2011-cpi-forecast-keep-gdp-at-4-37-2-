Mexico  economists cut their 2011
inflation forecast for a fourth consecutive month and reduced
their economic growth forecast for the first time this year.  Consumer prices will rise 3.56 percent in 2011, according
to the central bank’s monthly  survey  of economists, down from a
forecast of 3.67 percent in May and 3.87 percent in April. The
economy will expand 4.31 percent this year, less than the 4.37
percent forecast previously, according to the survey.  “Inflation has been declining due to seasonal factors, but
we may see prices rising in the next three months,” said Delia
Paredes, chief economist at Banorte-Ixe, in Mexico City, said in
a phone interview. “The economy will start surging again in the
second half of the year thanks to stronger internal demand.”  Banorte-Ixe estimates 4.5 percent economic expansion in
2011 with annual inflation of 3.7 percent.  Among the major Latin American countries that target
inflation, only Mexico has kept lending rates unchanged this
year as both growth and inflation in  Latin America ’s second-
biggest economy have slowed. Central bank Governor Agustin Carstens said in May that economic growth may reach 5 percent in
2011 provided domestic consumption and private investment
recover.  Yields on futures contracts for the 28-day TIIE interbank
rate due in January fell 3 basis points to 4.94 percent,
indicating traders expect the central bank to raise the rate in
February.  Extra Yield  The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican government
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed 7 basis points
yesterday to 123, according to JP Morgan Chase & Co.  The 30 economists and consulting firms surveyed by Mexico’s
central bank also lowered their forecasts for growth in private
consumption to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent in a June 1 survey,
according to the statement.  The survey’s forecast for private investment rose to 6.5
percent from 5.9 percent, the bank said.  Mexico’s peso headed for its biggest weekly gain since
September as concern eased that  Greece  would be unable to
resolve its debt crisis.  The peso advanced 2.2 percent this week to 11.6302 per  U.S.
dollar  at 11:42 a.m. New York time, from 11.9001 on June 24. The
rise was the largest since the week ending Sept. 24. The
currency rose 0.7 percent today.  Consumer Price Decline  Consumer prices fell 0.74 percent in May, slowing annual
inflation to 3.25 percent, the central bank said June 9,
cementing expectations that policy makers will have room to keep
 interest rates  at a historic low.  Since June 1, consumer confidence fell to 89.3 in May from
89.7 in April according to the National Statistics Agency.
Industrial production declined to 1.4 percent in April from 4.2
percent in March, the agency said June 13, while unemployment
rose to 5.20 percent from 5.10 percent.  Mexico’s economy grew 2.44 percent in April from a year
earlier, the national statistics agency said on June 28.  Banco de Mexico  on May 27 extended its longest-ever pause,
keeping the overnight rate unchanged for a 19th straight
meeting. The decision matched the forecast of all 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Policy makers next meet on July 8.  In the central bank’s last quarterly inflation report
published May 11, policy makers kept their 2011 inflation
forecast unchanged at 2 percent to 4 percent while raising their
growth estimate to 4 percent to 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
