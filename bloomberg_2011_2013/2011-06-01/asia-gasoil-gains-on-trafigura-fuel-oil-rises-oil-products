Asia gasoil climbed as Trafigura
Beheer BV bought three cargoes in Singapore, the region’s
biggest oil-trading center.  Fuel oil  rose to the highest in four
weeks as processing losses narrowed.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil, or diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur rose 55 cents,
or 0.4 percent, to $128.55 a barrel, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Jet fuel gained 60 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$129.70. Each product climbed to the highest since May 11.  In Singapore, Trafigura bought three 150,000-barrel cargoes
of 0.5 percent sulfur gasoil at 10 cents a barrel below
benchmark quotes, traders said. Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold one
cargo and Hin Leong Trading Pte sold two. Hin Leong also sold a
similar-sized cargo to Glencore International AG at 10 cents a
barrel below June quotes.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude rose 88
cents to $19.31 a barrel at 6 p.m. Singapore time, based on data
from PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure
of refining profit, was at the widest since May 5.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising to
$1.30 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade fell 19 percent last
month, signaling it was less profitable to produce  aviation fuel 
over diesel.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil climbed $6.75, or 1
percent, to $666.50 a metric ton, according to Bloomberg data.
The price of 380-centistoke fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel,
rose $6.50, or 1 percent, to $656.50. Each variety advanced to
the highest since May 5.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 51 cents to
$6.60 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data. The difference narrowed
for a third day, indicating reduced losses for refiners turning
oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade gained 25 cents to $10 a ton, Bloomberg data showed. This
viscosity spread yesterday was at the narrowest since May 11,
meaning bunker is rising less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  rose $7.75,
or 0.8 percent, to $984.75 a ton, according to Bloomberg data.
That’s the highest since May 12.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded  Brent crude  climbed
$9.78 to $107.34 a ton, the highest so far this week, Bloomberg
data showed. A widening crack spread indicates increased profit
from making the petrochemical feedstock.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline in Singapore fell 50 cents, or
0.4 percent, to $120.05 a barrel, based on Bloomberg data.
That’s the biggest decline in a week. Gasoline’s premium to
naphtha dropped $1.30 to $12.60. A narrowing reforming margin
shows it’s less profitable to turn naphtha into gasoline.  In Singapore, Vitol Group bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON
gasoline from BP Plc at $120.10 a barrel, traders said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
