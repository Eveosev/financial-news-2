OAO Gazprom named Andrei Akimov, the
head of OAO Gazprombank, and Vladimir Mau, a rector of a Russian
university, as candidates to represent the government on the
board, the gas exporter said in an e-mailed statement.  Akimov and Mau were put forward to replace Energy Minister
Sergei Shmatko and Economy Minister  Elvira Nabiullina  after
Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev  ordered the removal of state
officials from the boards of companies in sectors they regulate.  Medvedev on April 2 issued an order to remove eight
ministers and deputy prime ministers from the boards of major
state-run companies by July 1. Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin 
stepped down as chairman of OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil
company, the same month.  Gazprom will hold an extraordinary shareholders meeting on
June 30 to vote on the list, the Moscow-based company said.  Gazprom also named Timur Kulibayev, the head of
Kazakhstan’s National Wellbeing Fund Samruk-Kazyna, as a board
nominee. The other board members, including Chairman Victor Zubkov, who is also first deputy prime minister in charge of
agriculture, were listed for re-election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
