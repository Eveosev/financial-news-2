The dollar fell against the majority
of its most-traded peers before reports likely to show U.S.
companies hired fewer workers and manufacturing cooled.  The Dollar Index declined before the private ADP Employers
Services report is released today, followed by the non-payroll
figures on June 3. The euro advanced to a three-week high versus
the greenback amid speculation  Greece  is close to an agreement
on aid to ease its debt burden. The Swiss franc strengthened as
data showed retail sales rose at the fastest rate for two years.  “The markets are shifting their focus, particularly from
the intense concerns over debt restructuring, and we’ve had a
series of weak economic data in the U.S.,” said  Derek Halpenny ,
European head of currency research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
UFJ Ltd. in  London . “If there’s any evidence of a considerable
worsening in the employment situation, I think that would
certainly hit confidence pretty significantly.”  The dollar was little changed at $1.4405 per euro as of
10:23 a.m. in London, after dropping 0.5 percent to $1.4448, the
weakest since May 6. It declined 0.2 percent to 81.36 yen. The
euro fetched 117.19 yen from 117.37 yesterday, when it reached
117.80, the highest since May 5.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which
measures the greenback against the currencies of six trading
partners, was at 74.58 after declining as low as 74.39, also the
lowest since May 6.  U.S. Data  Companies in the U.S. added 175,000 workers in May compared
with 179,000 the prior month, according to the median estimate
of 37 economists in a Bloomberg survey before the ADP report.
Labor Department data on June 3 will show a 180,000 gain in
payrolls compared with April’s 244,000 increase, a separate
survey shows.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index, due
today in the U.S., probably fell to 57.1 last month, the lowest
since October, according to the median forecast. Readings above
50 signal expansion.  The euro pared its gains after German newspaper  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  reported the IMF may not pay out its fifth
tranche of aid to Greece in June after officials assess the
country’s progress in cutting its deficit.  “This article has caused uncertainty,” said  Niels Christensen , chief currency strategist at Nordea Bank AB in
Copenhagen. “That said, there’s a lot of confusion in the
market, because there are also reports that the IMF is willing
to consider a new package to Greece.”  Swiss Retail Sales  The 17-member common currency earlier reached the highest
level in more than a week against the U.K. currency as
Kathimerini newspaper reported Greece is close to an agreement
with the European Commission, ECB and the IMF on a  fiscal plan 
and privatization program, citing people close to Prime Minister
 George Papandreou . Details are expected to be settled by tonight
or tomorrow morning, the newspaper said.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said May 30
that the euro region’s leaders will likely decide on a new aid
package by the end of June and have ruled out a “total
restructuring” of Greece’s debt.  The Swiss franc advanced against all 16 of its major
counterparts as a report showed retail sales climbed 7.5 percent
in April, boosting speculation the  Swiss National Bank  may raise
borrowing costs. Separate data showed the SVME purchasing
managers index rose to 59.2 in May from 58.4 in April, beating a
median forecast of a decline to 57.5.  The franc gained 0.6 percent to 1.2221 per euro. It reached
1.2102 on May 27, the strongest on record, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Swiss currency appreciated 0.7
percent to 84.80 centimes per dollar.  Pound, Aussie  The pound slid amid concern about the strength of the
U.K.’s economic recovery after data showed manufacturing and
mortgage approvals slumped.  The British currency slipped 0.2 percent to $1.6419, after
earlier advancing as much as 0.3 percent. It depreciated 0.3
percent to 87.77 pence per euro.  Australia ’s dollar rose after the statistics bureau said
gross domestic product contracted 1.2 percent in the first
quarter from the previous three months. The lowest estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 2 percent contraction.  “The GDP number wasn’t as bad as some in the market were
expecting,” said Derek Mumford, a Sydney-based director at
Rochford Capital, a foreign exchange and interest-rate risk
management firm. “We’re certainly seeing a bit of a rally in
the Aussie dollar.”  The so-called Aussie climbed 0.5 percent to $1.0729 and
gained 0.3 percent to 87.26 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
