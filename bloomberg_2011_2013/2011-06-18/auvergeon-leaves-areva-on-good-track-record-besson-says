Areva SA’s outgoing Chief Executive
Officer  Anne Lauvergeon , who was denied a third term by the
French government, is leaving her job at the head of the
nuclear-reactor maker on a “good” track-record, Industry
Minister Eric Besson told Le Monde in an interview.  Changing the top job of a state-controlled company after
two terms is “something natural,” Besson was quoted as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
