Tokyo Electric Power Co. halted a
water decontamination system today after five hours because a
cesium-absorption unit supplied by Kurion Inc. needed
replacement sooner than expected.  Tokyo Electric is investigating the cause and doesn’t know
when it will be able to restart the system, Junichi Matsumoto, a
spokesman for the utility, said at a news conference streamed
over the Internet. The decontamination system uses technology
from Kurion and  France ’s Areva SA.  Tepco, as the utility is known, began the decontamination
process at 8 p.m. yesterday as a part of its plan to reduce the
amount of radiation in about 105 million liters (28 million
gallons) of water in basements and trenches at the Fukushima
Dai-Ichi nuclear plant. Tepco expects the volume of contaminated
water to almost double by the end of the year.  The system was halted at 12:54 a.m. after the level of
cesium in the absorption unit reached 4.7 millisieverts of
radiation, Matsumoto said. Such units generally need replacement
at a level of 4 millisieverts, and the company had expected the
unit to last about a month, Matsumoto said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
