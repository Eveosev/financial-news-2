Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) ’s U.K. unit’s loss
narrowed to 34.2 million pounds ($55.4 million) following 10
million pounds in costs related to the collapse of  Borders Group
Inc. (BGP) , the  Guardian  reported, citing accounts filed at Companies
House.  That was improvement on the U.K. unit’s 52.2 million-pound
loss that was reported a year earlier, the newspaper said.  “Our sales are still growing despite tough conditions on
the high street and our financial position continues to
improve,” the Guardian cited Darcy Willson-Rymer, U.K. managing
director, as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
