Society Rocks, ridden by Pat
Cosgrave, won the Golden Jubilee Stakes at the Royal Ascot horse
races outside  London .  The horse, trained by James Fanshawe, was runnerup in last
yearâ€™s event. Today the 25-1 longshot won by half a length over
Monsieur Chevalier and Star Witness in third. At 25-1, a
successful $1 bet brings in $25 and the original stake.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
