Russia  plans to develop biogas to
provide fuel and power in rural regions, supplementing fossil
fuels in the world’s biggest exporter of oil and gas.  The country may produce 66 billion cubic meters of biogas a
year from agricultural waste, the Energy Ministry said today in
an e-mailed statement. That is equivalent to 33 billion liters
(8.7 billion gallons) of gasoline or diesel a year or could
generate 110 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity and 1 billion
gigajoules of heat, it said.  The Energy and Agriculture Ministries plan to seek
subsidies and legislative support from the government to expand
use of the renewable resource and make it profitable, Deputy
Agriculture Minister Shamil Vakhitov said in the statement.
“Without these measures, bioenergy has no future in Russia.”  OAO Inter RAO UES and  China ’s National Bio Energy Co.
agreed June 16 to create the Green Energy Corp. joint venture by
the end of this year to overhaul inefficient power plants that
run on coal and fuel oil to include the use of biomass,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
