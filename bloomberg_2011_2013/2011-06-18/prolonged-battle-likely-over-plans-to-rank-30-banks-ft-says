There will be prolonged wrangling
over additional  capital requirements  for about 30 of the world’s
biggest banks, as global regulators plan to group institutions
by their size and structural complexity, the Financial Times
 reported , citing bankers it didn’t identify.  Regulators are seeking to place large banks into separate
tiers or “buckets,” the newspaper reported. The biggest and
most complex businesses would have a capital surcharge of 2.5
percent of their assets, adjusted for risk, in addition to the
7 percent minimum capital ratio agreed to in a new global bank
capital framework, known as Basel III, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
