Traders acting “in good faith”
will gain title over European Union carbon allowances even
should the seller’s title turn out to be defective, according to
a draft plan from the European Commission.  Regulators are seeking to boost security in the market
after the thefts of allowances prompted the closure of spot
trading on the BlueNext exchange in Paris in January for 15
days. The EU carbon market was set up to help the bloc achieve
its emissions-reduction target under the 1997  Kyoto Protocol .  EU nations in the Climate Change Committee yesterday added
the clause to a draft plan protecting inadvertent buyers of
stolen carbon permits ahead of a vote.  “A purchaser and holder of an allowance or Kyoto unit
acting in good faith will acquire title to an allowance or Kyoto
unit free of any defects in the title of the transferor,”
according to the clause, which was e-mailed by the European
Commission.  To contact the reporters on this story:
