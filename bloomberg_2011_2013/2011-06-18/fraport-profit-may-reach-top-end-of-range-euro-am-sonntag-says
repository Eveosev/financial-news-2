Fraport AGâ€™s profit may reach the
upper end of its target range,  Euro am Sonntag  reported, citing
Chief Executive Officer Stefan Schulte.  Schulte said that if everything continues according to
plan, with no further volcanic ash clouds disrupting flights, no
strikes or other interruptions, the company is likely to reach
the higher end of the 10 percent to 15 percent operating profit
growth guidance this year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
