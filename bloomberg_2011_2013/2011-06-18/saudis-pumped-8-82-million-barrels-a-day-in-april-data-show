Saudi Arabia , the worldâ€™s largest
crude exporter, pumped 8.82 million barrels of oil a day in
April, up by 1.9 percent from 8.66 million the previous month,
official data showed.  The kingdom exported 6.76 million barrels a day in April,
for a monthly increase of 3.4 percent, according to figures
posted on the Joint Organization Data Initiative website today.
The figures for Saudi oil output in both months include
condensate but exclude natural gas liquids, the website said.  The initiative is supervised by the Riyadh-based
 International Energy Forum  and shows historical data supplied
directly by governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
