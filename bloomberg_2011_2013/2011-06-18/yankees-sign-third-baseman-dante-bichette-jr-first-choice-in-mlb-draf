The  New York Yankees  have signed
Dante Bichette Jr., the teamâ€™s first choice in the 2011 Major
League Baseball draft.  Third baseman Bichette batted a team-leading .640 with 58
runs, 14 doubles, 10 home runs and 40 runs batted in as a senior
at Orangewood Christian High School in Maitland, Florida, in
2011, the Yankees said in a news release.  He is the son of Dante Bichette, who retired in 2001 after
batting .299 with 274 home runs in 1,704 major league games over
14 seasons for teams including the  Boston Red Sox  and Colorado
Rockies, the team said.  Bichette, who the Yankees selected with the 51st overall
pick, will join the Gulf Coast League Yankees when their season
begins tomorrow.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
