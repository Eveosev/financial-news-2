Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , the tree-
plantation owner targeted by short-seller Carson Block, may have
overstated the value of its forestry holdings in  China ’s Yunnan
province, the  Globe and Mail  said, citing Xie Hongting, chairman
of Gengma, which sold land to the Hong Kong-based forest
products company.  There are “inconsistencies” in Sino-Forest’s valuation of
its Yunnan assets, the Toronto-based newspaper reported, citing
interviews with Chinese government officials, forestry experts
it did not identify.  A plantation on which Sino-Forest bought timber rights in
2007 is smaller than the 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres) the
company claims, the Globe said, citing Hongting and an interview
with a provincial forestry official it did not identify.  Sino-Forest stands by the 200,000 hectare figure, the Globe
said, citing a written statement from the company, which said it
bought 13,300 hectares directly from Gengma, and another 180,000
hectares from other sellers, using Gengma as a broker.  A message seeking comment and left at Sino-Forest’s
headquarters in  Hong Kong  outside office hours was not
immediately returned to Bloomberg News  Sino-Forest yesterday fell 15 cents, or 4.5 percent, to
C$3.19 in Toronto Stock Exchange trading and has declined 82
percent since June 1 after Muddy Waters LLC, an investment firm
run by Block, claimed the company overstated its holdings and
production.  Allen Chan, Sino-Forest’s chief executive officer, has
denied the assertions, established an independent committee to
investigate and appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to assist.  To contact the reporter on this story:
