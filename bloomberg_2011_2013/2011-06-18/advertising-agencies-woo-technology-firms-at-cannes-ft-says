Advertising agencies are seeking to
team with technology firms at the Cannes Lions advertising
festival as marketing budgets recover, allowing more
experimentation,  the Financial Times said.   About half of marketers are shifting more spending into
“riskier activities” over the next year, according to a survey
conducted by Universal McCann, the Interpublic Group of
Companies Inc.-owned agency, with Advertising Age magazine.
About a quarter may use part of their media budget to make
venture investments in start-ups, the survey found.  The Cannes Lions advertising festival starts tomorrow in
Cannes,  France .  To contact the reporters on this story:
