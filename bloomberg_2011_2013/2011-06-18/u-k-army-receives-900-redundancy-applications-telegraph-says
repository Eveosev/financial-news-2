The U.K. army received more than 900
applications for voluntary redundancy, almost twice the 500 it
requested, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  The army asked for 25 colonels to volunteer for redundancy
and received 52 applications, while six brigadiers and 48 majors
also volunteered to leave, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
