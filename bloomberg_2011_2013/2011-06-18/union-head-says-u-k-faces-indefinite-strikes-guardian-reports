U.K. public-sector workers are
prepared for “indefinite” industrial action on a scale not
seen since the 1926 general strike to challenge government
pension plan changes,  Dave Prentis , head of the country’s
largest labor union, said in an interview with the Guardian.  “I strongly believe that one day of industrial action
will not change anyone’s mind in government. We want to move
towards a settlement,” Prentis, who heads the 1.4 million
member organization Unison, was quoted as saying. “The purpose
of industrial action is not industrial action, it is to get an
agreement that is acceptable and long-lasting. But we are
prepared for rolling action over an indefinite period.”  Prentis said that while pension changes were the focus of
the dispute, and formed the legal basis for a strike, his
members were also angry about the impact of government cuts on
state employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
