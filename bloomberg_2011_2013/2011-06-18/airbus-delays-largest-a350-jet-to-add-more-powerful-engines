Airbus SAS delayed introduction of
its largest A350 wide-body aircraft by 18 months to meet demands
for additional range and payload that will put the jet into more
direct competition with  Boeing Co (BA) ’s 777-300ER.  Rolls-Royce Plc, the sole engine supplier on the jet, will
improve the performance of the Trent XWB engine by enlarging the
core and working with more advanced technologies, the two
companies said at a joint press conference yesterday in Paris.
The A350-1000 aircraft, which seats about 350 people, will cost
$9 million more than the previous design and come out in 2017.  Airbus aims to crack the near monopoly of Boeing’s 777,
which debuted in the 1990s, and the European manufacturer said
its new A350-1000 will be 25 percent more fuel efficient and can
carry 4.5 tons of additional weight. The change on the A350
coincides with Airbus challenging Boeing in the single-aisle
market with new, more efficient engines for its A320 jet.  “We got feedback from customers, some quite vocal, and the
message was that if we can get extra range, we should do it,”
Fabrice Bregier, chief operating officer of Airbus, said in an
interview in Paris yesterday.  Three Variants  The A350 comes in three variants, with the mid-sized
A350-900 being the most popular model, accounting for more than
60 percent of total 574 orders. Airbus maintained planned
delivery of its A350-900 for the end of 2013, with Bregier
saying it would be “a race against the clock.” Four customers
have ordered 75 A350-1000s to date, according to Airbus.  Airbus will also delay the smallest version of the A350,
which seats 270 and for which it has 140 orders. That model
won’t change, and the extended period gives Airbus breathing
space to work on the A350-900 as well as the A320neo.  The changes on the largest variant include work on the
landing gear and the outer part of the wing, Airbus said. The
improved performance will allow the aircraft to service routes
such as  Shanghai  to Boston or Paris to Santiago that are
becoming increasingly popular, Airbus said. There will be no
impact on earnings from the planned changes, the company said.  ‘Significant Investment’  Boeing is studying modifications to defend the 16-year-old
777 against Airbus. The U.S. company will monitor Airbus for
production schedules before deciding whether to improve the 777
or offer an all-new variant,  Jim Albaugh , its commercial
airplanes chief, said earlier this month.  The U.S. company is targeting improvements to its 777
family around 2015 that would include work on the wing and
engines, according to Nicole Piasecki, Boeing Commercial
Airplanes’ head of business development.  “Once Airbus defines the A350-1000, we are prepared to
make a much more significant investment in the 777,” she told
journalists during a pre-show briefing this month.  The decision to do more work on the Trent XWB is among the
first by Rolls-Royce Chief Executive Officer John Rishton, who
took over from longtime CEO John Rose in May. Rolls-Royce has
been granted exclusivity on the A350-1000 variant. Rolls-Royce
has gained market share in the wide-body segment, with its Trent
700 powering the A330 family of Airbus aircraft, and the Trent
900 used on the A380 double-decker.  Qatar Airways  is the first and largest customer for the
A350, with 80 on order. The Mideast carrier said this month that
it would like to see improvements to the model. International
Lease Finance Corp., the world’s biggest plane leasing company
by fleet value, has 20 A350s on order and has also said it
favors a more powerful variant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
