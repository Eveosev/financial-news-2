London â€™s wealthy are facing a 6
percent jump in price inflation, compared with 4.5 percent for
average goods and services in the U.K., the  Financial Times
reported , citing an index.  The rise was driven by a 6.7 percent climb in rental prices
for the most desirable London properties, a 28 percent rise in
the cost of fine wines and an 11 percent increase in art-auction
prices, according to the report, which cited the  Stonehage 
Affluent Luxury Living Index for the year to April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
