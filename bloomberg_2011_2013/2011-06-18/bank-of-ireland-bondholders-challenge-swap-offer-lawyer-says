A group of Bank of Ireland Plc
junior bondholders filed a legal challenge against the lender’s
plans to exchange their securities for cash or equity at a
discount to par value, a lawyer for the investors said.  New York-based law firm  White & Case  LLP filed legal papers
yesterday in the  High Court  in  London  for bondholders owed about
$750 million, Stephen Phillips, a lawyer with White & Case, said
by telephone today. The bondholders are seeking a declaration
that any court order the Irish government may secure amending
terms of junior bonds “does not have any effect on bonds issued
under  English law ,’ he said.  The bondholders remain open to talks with the 36 percent
government-owned bank, said Phillips. Some bondholders are
prepared to “backstop a rights offer by the bank, which would
reduce the amount the government may need to inject” into the
bank, he said. Bank of Ireland spokesman Dan Loughrey declined
to comment. The Irish Independent first  reported  the challenge
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
