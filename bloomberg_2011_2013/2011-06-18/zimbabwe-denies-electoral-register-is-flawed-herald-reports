Zimbabwe ’s registrar general,
Tobaiwa Mudede denied reports that the country’s electoral
register is flawed, saying no country “in the world” has a
better system, the state-controlled  Herald  said, citing Mudede.  Mudede was responding to press reports, including one by
Bloomberg, that said there were an impossible number of people
over 100 years of age, the Harare-based Herald said. President
 Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front
agreed the register was accurate, while Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai ’s Movement for Democratic Change said the register
was a “shambles,” the Herald reported.  A June 3 report published by the South African Institute
for Race Relations said there were an “impossible” number of
centenarians, at over 41,199, on the register, 16,828 of them
born on Jan. 1, 1901.  To contact the reporter on this story:
