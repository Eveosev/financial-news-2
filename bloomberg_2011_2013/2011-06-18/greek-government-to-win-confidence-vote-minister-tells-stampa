The Greek government will win the
vote of confidence set for June 21, Growth Competitiveness and
Shipping Minister Michalis Chrisochoides told Italian daily  La
Stampa .  He forecast that  Greece  will go back to pre-crisis growth
levels within 30 months, or the end of 2013, if the country gets
an aid package, according to the interview.  Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou yesterday announced
a Cabinet reshuffle that included replacing Finance Minister
 George Papaconstantinou , in a bid to get rebelling allies to
back the 78 billion-euro austerity plan that the European Union
and IMF have made a condition for new aid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
