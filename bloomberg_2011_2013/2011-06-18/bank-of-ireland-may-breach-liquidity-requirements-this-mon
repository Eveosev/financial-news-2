Bank of Ireland Plc notified the
country’s central bank that it may breach regulatory liquidity
requirements this month, following two similar incidents in
January and April.  “The group has notified the central bank of the likelihood
of a further liquidity breach in the month of June,” the bank
said in a  prospectus , published on its website today, ahead of a
share sale next month. “The actions agreed with the central
bank to delever the balance sheet” of the bank by the end of
2013 “are expected to reduce the group’s funding and liquidity
risk and ensure ongoing compliance with regulatory liquidity
ratios.”  Bank of Ireland reported the January and April liquidity
breaches in its annual report, published in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
