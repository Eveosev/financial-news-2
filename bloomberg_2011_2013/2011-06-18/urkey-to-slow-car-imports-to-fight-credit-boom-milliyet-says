Turkey  plans to slow car imports as
one measure to fight a swelling credit boom and widening current
account deficit, Milliyet said, without saying where it got the
information.  The measure may mean imposing limits on bank lending to
consumers for car purchases, the Istanbul-based newspaper said.
An increase in car import or  sales tax  may also be considered
should other measures fail to lessen the trade gap and loan
growth at banks, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
