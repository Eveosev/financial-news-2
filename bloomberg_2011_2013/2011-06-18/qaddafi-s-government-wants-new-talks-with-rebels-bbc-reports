Libya ’s prime minister called for
“new” negotiations between the government and rebel leaders to
resolve the conflict, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported,
citing the premier, Baghdadi Mahmudi.  Meetings with rebel representatives had already taken place
in Egypt, France, Norway and  Tunisia , the  BBC  cited al-Mahmudi
as saying, contradicting claims by the opposition that they’ve
had no contact with the government of  Muammar Qaddafi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
