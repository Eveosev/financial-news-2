Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker
said he has spoken with international banks about how to
structure the bondholder element of a new Greek aid package,
 Luxemburger Wort  reported, citing an interview.  Juncker said he met on Thursday with German bankers
including  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  Chief Executive Officer  Martin Blessing , adding that a “mishandling of the Greek debt problem
would be full of potential for contagion,” according to the
newspaper.  Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance
ministers, criticized a rating-company warning about banks
including  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA as “completely over the top,”
according to the Wort.  To contact the reporter on this story:
