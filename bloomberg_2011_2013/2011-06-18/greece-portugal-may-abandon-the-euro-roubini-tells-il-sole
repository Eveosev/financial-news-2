Greece and Portugal may abandon the
 euro  currency in the next five years if growth isn’t restored,
economist  Nouriel Roubini  said in an interview with daily  Il
Sole 24 Ore .  “I don’t rule out that Greece and Portugal, if they aren’t
able to recover competitiveness and growth and social tension
further increases, may go back to the drachma and escudo on the
wave of populist governments,” Roubini, the  chairman of
Roubini Global Economics, told the newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
