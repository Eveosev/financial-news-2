Texas Congressman  Ron Paul  easily
won the 2012 presidential preference straw poll today at the
Southern Republican Leadership Conference.  Paul, a perennial president candidate with a strong
following among young libertarian activists, won the
unscientific survey with 612 votes of the roughly 2,000 who
attended the three-day conference in New Orleans, according to
results announced by conference organizers.  Former Utah Governor  Jon Huntsman , who recently served as
President Barack Obama’s ambassador to China, came in second
with 382 votes. Huntsman canceled his scheduled address to the
event because of illness, aides said. His wife, Mary Kaye,
privately met with party officials and delegates at the
conference.  Minnesota Representative Michele Bachmann, a Tea Party
favorite, came in third with 191 votes.  Herman Cain , the founder
of Godfather’s Pizza, picked up 104 votes. Former Massachusetts
Governor Mitt Romney, who skipped the event, won 74 votes.
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich got 69 votes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
