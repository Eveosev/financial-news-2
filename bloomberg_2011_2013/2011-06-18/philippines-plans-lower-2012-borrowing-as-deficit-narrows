The  Philippines  plans to reduce
borrowing by 12.5 percent next year even while boosting the
budget as  tax revenue  expands and the deficit narrows, economic
officials said today in Manila.  Borrowing will probably decline to 727.4 billion pesos
($16.7 billion) from a revised 830.9 billion pesos this year,
Finance Undersecretary Rosalia de Leon said today after the
government’s economic team met to discuss targets for 2012.
Overseas debt sales will fall from this year’s planned $3.25
billion, de Leon said in an interview late yesterday.  The budget shortfall is projected to narrow in 2012 to 2.6
percent of gross domestic product, or about 270 billion pesos,
from this year’s ceiling of some 300 billion pesos, Finance
Undersecretary Gil Beltran said today. The administration of
President  Benigno Aquino  had a  budget surplus  in the first four
months of this year, prompting Moody’s Investors Service on June
15 to raise its  credit rating  to Ba2, two levels below
investment grade.  Foreign borrowing including overseas development loans will
decline to 178.4 billion pesos next year from this year’s
planned 191.9 billion pesos, de Leon said.  The Philippines may sell more peso-denominated notes to
overseas investors in 2012, she said. It has so far sold the
equivalent of $1.25 billion of global peso notes and $1.5
billion of dollar-denominated debt in 2011.  Higher Tax Goal  The Bureau of Internal Revenue, responsible for more than
60 percent of government earnings, aims to increase tax
collection to 1.066 trillion pesos next year from a target 940
billion pesos in 2011 on the back of improved collection
efficiency, Commissioner  Kim Henares  said.  The Southeast Asian nation plans to increase next year’s
budget by between 8 percent and 12 percent to boost spending for
social services, Budget Secretary Butch Abad said. It likely
incurred a  budget deficit  in May as spending expanded from
April, he said. The shortfall totaled 30.53 billion pesos in May
2010, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  Government will “jack up” spending in the second half as
it aims to meet its 7 percent to 8 percent “aspirational”
growth target this year, Abad said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
