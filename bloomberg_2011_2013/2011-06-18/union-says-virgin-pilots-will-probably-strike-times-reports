Pilots working for Virgin Atlantic
Airways Ltd. will probably go on strike over pay rates, the
 London-based Times reported , citing a British Airline Pilots
Association official, who it didn’t identify.  Walkouts are set for next month at an airline that’s never
before had strikes, according to the report.  “We have offered everybody the same increases and only one
group of workers has refused it,”  Richard Branson , president of
the airline, told the newspaper. “I am sure we will get it
sorted.” A ballot of workers closes June 21, the Times said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
