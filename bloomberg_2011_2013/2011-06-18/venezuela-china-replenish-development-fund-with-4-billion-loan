Venezuela  and  China  signed an accord
to replenish a bilateral development fund with a $4 billion loan
from the  China Development Bank , according to an e-mailed
statement from state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA.  The $32 billion fund, which was established in 2008,
finances Venezuelan industrial, housing and transportation
projects, the statement said. Venezuela, in turn, provides China
with oil for its investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
