The aggressive 0104:H4 E. coli
bacteria strain has been found in a brook in  Frankfurt ,  Deutsche
Presse-Agentur  reported, citing an unidentified spokesman from
the Hesse state Environment Ministry.  The brook is not connected to the drinking water supply so
there is no danger of contamination, DPA said.  Two farms bordering on the brook, which have used the water
to irrigate potatoes, sugar beets and starch potatoes, have now
been forbidden to use the water, DPA said. It is unclear how the
bacteria ended up in the brook and the results of tests should
be ready within two to three days, DPA said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
