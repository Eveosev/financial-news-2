Former Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, the first democratically elected leader of his country,
has died of a heart attack in his Lusaka home. He was 68.  “Ten minutes before midnight he had a heart attack and was
declared dead by the doctor at 0:05 a.m.,” Emmanuel Mwamba, his
spokesman, said in an interview today. President Rupiah Banda
will preside over a state funeral for Chiluba, Mwamba said.  In 1991, Chiluba replaced Kenneth Kaunda, who had been
president since the country won independence from Britain in
1964. Chiluba was succeeded by his deputy, Levy Mwanawasa, in
2002 after trying to amend the constitution to run for a third
term.  Chiluba faced corruption charges after leaving office and
in 2007 he was found guilty by a U.K. court of stealing $46
million. In 2009, a Zambian court dropped more than 60 charges
of theft against Chiluba, amounting to more than $40 million,
because it didn’t have sufficient evidence to secure a
conviction.  “Economic liberalization is what he will be remembered for
most,” said Richard Sakala, Chiluba’s press aide for 10 years.
“The boom in the mining sector would have not been possible
without him as he passed laws to sell the mines,” Sakala said
in an interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
