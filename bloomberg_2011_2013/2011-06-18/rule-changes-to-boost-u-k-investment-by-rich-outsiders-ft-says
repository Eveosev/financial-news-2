Changes in rules governing how much
money wealthy outsiders can invest in the U.K. will lure higher
inflows, the  Financial Times reported , citing a government
consultation published yesterday on the  Treasury website .  The proposed rules governing non-domiciles, or rich
foreigners living in Britain, could attract money currently in
 Switzerland  and the U.K.â€™s Jersey Island for investment in
property and companies, according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
