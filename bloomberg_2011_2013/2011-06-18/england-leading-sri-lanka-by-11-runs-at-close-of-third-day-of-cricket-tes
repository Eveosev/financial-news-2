England  leads Sri Lanka by 11 runs
after finishing on 195-4 on the third day of their third cricket
Test at Southampton.  Kevin Pietersen  led the hosts with 85 runs before being
caught off the bowling of Thisara Perera. That allowed England
to recover from the early loss of the wickets of captain
Andrew Strauss and Jonathan Trott, which left it on 14-2.
Strauss was caught on 3 off Chanaka Welegedara and Trott was
caught on 4 off Suranga Lakmal.  Sri Lanka got 7 runs for its final wicket this morning
while being bowled out for 184 this morning at the Rose Bowl in
Southampton. Stuart Broad took the wicket of Welegedara, who was
out on 7. England’s  Chris Tremlett  took 6 wickets in the Sri
Lankan innings. The first several days have been delayed by
rain.  England leads the three-Test series 1-0, after winning the
first match in Cardiff. The second Test, at Lord’s in London,
was drawn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
