Saudi Arabian shares fell to a
three-month low, led by banks and petrochemical companies, after
the  International Monetary Fund  cut its U.S. growth forecast for
2011.  Al Rajhi Bank (RJHI) , the kingdom’s largest publicly traded lender
by market value, and  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s
biggest petrochemicals maker, paced the losses.  Banque Saudi
Fransi (BSFR)  fell for a fourth straight day.  The 146-company Tadawul All Share Index dropped 0.7 percent
to 6,501.25, the lowest level since March 23, at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Riyadh, extending its monthly loss to 3.5 percent.
Three shares dropped for every stock that rose.  “Investors are concerned that demand for petrochemicals
will drop after the IMF cut its projection for U.S. growth,”
Turki Fadaak, an analyst with AlBilad Investment Co., said in
Riyadh.  The  U.S. economy  will grow 2.5 percent this year and 2.7
percent in 2012, down from the 2.8 percent and 2.9 percent
projected in April, the IMF said yesterday. The Washington-based
fund sees the world economy expanding 4.3 percent this year,
down from 4.4 percent in April.  Saudi Arabia’s petrochemical exports in April made up 31
percent of the kingdom’s overall non-oil exports valued at 12.3
billion riyals ($3.3 billion), according to data published on
the Department of Statistics and Information’s website. Saudi
Arabia holds one-fifth of the world’s proven oil reserves.  Al Rajhi fell 1 percent, the largest loss in a week, to
72.75 riyals. Petrochemicals maker Sabic dropped 0.7 percent to
102 riyals. Banque Saudi tumbled 1.8 percent to 43.10 riyals,
the lowest price since March 6, extending its four-day loss to
4.2 percent.  Samba Financial Group (SAMBA) , Saudi Arabia’s second-largest lender
by market value, weakened 1.5 percent, the biggest drop in a
week, to 50 riyals. The stock has lost 11.9 percent this
quarter.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
