Germany ’s cartel office said the
outcome of its evaluation of  Liberty Global Inc. (LBTYA) ’s proposed
acquisition of Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg GmBH remains open,
 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung  reported, citing President
Andreas Mundt.  Mundt said the cable and television market has developed
very fast and become multifaceted, so one shouldn’t necessarily
look to the past to draw a conclusion for how the cartel office
will rule in the future, the newspaper reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
