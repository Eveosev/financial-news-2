European Union leaders are not
considering a Greek debt restructuring, giving bondholders the
choice to avoid bigger losses, said  Michel Barnier , the EU
financial services commissioner.  Banks can choose between “keeping their exposure to Greek
debt longer and clearly not pulling out, or risking losing a lot
a bit later,” Barnier said  in an interview with Europe 1
French radio station today. “The question of a restructuring is
not on the table,” he said.  EU officials moved closer to hammering out a new aid
package for Greece after Germany yesterday agreed to work with
the  European Central Bank  to make sure plans to include private
investors in a rescue don’t trigger a default. Stocks, bonds and
the euro all gained yesterday after German  Chancellor Angela
Merkel  withdrew her demand that bondholders be forced to
shoulder a “substantial” burden in a rescue.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
