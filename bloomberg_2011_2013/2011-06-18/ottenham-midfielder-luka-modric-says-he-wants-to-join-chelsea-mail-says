Tottenham midfielder Luka Modric
said he wants to join Chelsea to play in the  Champions League 
and compete for the title of English soccer’s Premier League.  Spurs rejected a 22 million pound ($36 million) offer for
the 25-year-old, and Chelsea is expected to come back with a new
bid, the  Daily Mail  said. Modric went public with his demand to
move in an effort to increase pressure on his north London team,
the Mail said.  “Chelsea are a big club with an ambitious owner,” Modric
told the newspaper. “They have great players and they have
ambitions to fight for the title and win the Champions League. I
want to stay in  London.”  Modric helped Tottenham make last season’s Champions
League, European soccer’s highest level club competition, before
the  London  club lost 5-0 over two matches to Real Madrid in the
quarterfinals. Spurs finished fifth in the Premier League last
season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
