Germany Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said private investors need to take part in any aid
package for Greece,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported.  Private investorsâ€™ participation needs to be voluntary,
substantial, quantifiable and reliable, Schaeuble told the
German newspaper in an interview published today.  European member states are willing to give Greece more time
to recover financially if the country makes additional efforts
including boosting  tax revenue  and speeding up privatization,
Schaeuble said. The burden of an aid package should not fall
solely on taxpayers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
