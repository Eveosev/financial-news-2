Tottenham Hotspur won’t sell Luka Modric, the club’s Croatian midfielder, “at any price,”
Chairman Daniel Levy said today.  “We shall not enter into any negotiations whatsoever, with
any club, regarding Luka,” Levy said today in a statement
posted on Tottenham’s website. “We now consider this matter
closed.”  Earlier today, the  Daily Mail reported  Modric wants to
leave the club for Chelsea, which is preparing a second offer
for the player in the next 48 hours for close to 30 million
pounds ($49 million). That’s compared with an earlier offer of
22 million pounds, the newspaper said.  “I want to leave Tottenham as friends,” Modric was quoted
as saying. Modric said he had an arrangement with Levy where
Tottenham would consider offers, according to the report.  Manchester City  was preparing a bid for the player at about
30 million pounds, the  Daily Mail  reported June 16. Modric would
be open to joining  Manchester United  if the Premier League
champion enters the bidding and Tottenham allows him to consider
a move to Old Trafford, the Guardian  reported  yesterday, citing
Nikky Vuksan, Modric’s representative. The price might reach 35
million pounds, according to that report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
