French Bordeaux wine makers are
facing a drop in sales after boosting prices of their 2010
vintage, the  Financial Times reported , citing Simon Staples,
Sales and Marketing Director from wine merchant Berry Bros &
Rudd.  The merchant will sell half as much as last year, Staples
said in the report. Investment values of the 2009 vintage have
not risen much, curbing investorsâ€™ interest in paying 20 percent
more for 2010 production, according to the report. The 2010
vintage is exceptional, the FT said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
