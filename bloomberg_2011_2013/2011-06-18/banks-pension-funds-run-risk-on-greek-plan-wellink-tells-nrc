Banks and pension funds run a risk
if they contribute on a voluntary basis to another rescue
operation for  Greece , European Central Bank Governing Council
member Nout Wellink said in an interview, NRC reported.  “Pension funds have Greek bonds,” Wellink said, according
to the Dutch daily newspaper. “They can sell them with a small
loss to limit the risks. But they are being asked to keep the
bonds. They then run the risk that the damage is three or four
times higher.”  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said today that aiding
Greece is “defensible” because a euro-area sovereign default
would be uncontrollable. European Union officials moved closer
to hammering out a new aid package for Greece after  Germany 
agreed to work with the ECB to make sure plans to include
private investors in a rescue don’t trigger a default.  “There’s a chance that a compulsory contribution will lead
to a writedown of Greek bonds and with that a bankruptcy of the
Greek banking sector,” NRC cited Wellink as saying. “At the
moment we’re financing because of monetary reasons the Greek
banking sector and indirectly the Greek state. But that will
stop. Politicians need to be aware of that.”  “There are other ways the private sector can contribute,”
Wellink said, according to NRC. “They can help privatize Greek
state companies or make direct investments in Greece.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
