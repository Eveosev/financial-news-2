General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Safran SA (SAF) ’s
CFM International jet-engine joint venture predicted the single-
aisle aircraft market will grow to $400 billion over the next 20
years as narrow-body jets come to dominate the industry.  In the next two decades, about two-thirds of the 35,000
airliners produced in the commercial aerospace market will be
narrow-body aircraft including regional planes, the venture’s
executives said at a briefing in Paris today.  Demand has held up even as higher  oil prices  persist, CFM
President Jean-Paul Ebanga told reporters in Paris before the
industry’s biggest gathering next week. Development of the CFM’s
Leap-X engine for narrow-body plane is meeting or exceeding its
goals for Airbus SAS’s A320neo upgraded jet, he said.  “This is the best market ever that anyone can remember,”
Ebanga said. “The outlook in terms of engine and engine
deliveries is very positive.”  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus are boosting production of their
single-aisle jets, and Airbus aims to get more than 500 orders
for its A3320neo narrow-body jet by the end of the air show.
Boeing, which predicted this week that single-aisle jets will
make up 70 percent of the total by 2030, uses CFM as its sole
supplier of engines on the 737, while the A320 has two options.  The two aircraft manufactures are boosting production, with
Boeing announcing this week that it will make 42 737 aircraft a
month by 2014, a move that Airbus may follow. When assembly
lines reach that rate, CFM will provide 74 percent of the
engines produced from the backlogs, or 1,460 a year, said Chaker
Chahrour, CFM’s executive vice president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
