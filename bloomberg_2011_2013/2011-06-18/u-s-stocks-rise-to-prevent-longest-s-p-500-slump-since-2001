U.S. stocks rose for the first time
in seven weeks, preventing the longest losing streaks for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
since 2001, as concern about the American economy ebbed even as
the Greek debt crisis deepened.  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , McDonald’s Corp. and Microsoft Corp.
advanced more than 2.4 percent this week to lead gains in the
Dow after reports on jobless claims, retail sales and housing
beat economist estimates.  VF Corp. (VFC)  jumped 12 percent after
agreeing to buy  Timberland Co. (TBL) , while J.C. Penney Co. surged 15
percent after hiring an Apple Inc. vice president as its chief
executive officer.  Owens-Illinois Inc. (OI)  fell 13 percent, the most
in the S&P 500, after cutting its profit-margin forecast.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,271.50. It lost 6.8 percent during the six-week slump. The
Dow rose 52.45 points, or 0.4 percent, to 12,004.36 this week.  “You have dry timber from the selloff, then you get a
match from the economic news and  Greece , and you’ve got a little
bit of fire going in the market,” said Paul Zemsky, the New
York-based head of  asset allocation  for ING Investment
Management, which oversees $550 billion. “It’s a recipe for
people reevaluating, and saying, ‘If Greece makes it, stocks are
kind of attractive here.’”  The  S&P 500  has declined 6.8 percent since April 29, its
high for the year. This week, it came within 1 point of erasing
its 2011 gain amid speculation Greece won’t repay its debt,
causing a shock to the global financial system. The cost of
insuring the European nation’s debt jumped, sending credit-
default swaps to a record 2,237 points on June 16. The concern
eased yesterday after German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  relented
on her stance that bondholders should shoulder the burden of the
Greek debt crisis.  Cheaper Stocks  While the S&P 500 has curbed its rally since the  bull
market  began on March 9, 2009, to 88 percent from as much as 102
percent, it’s also led to cheaper stock valuations. The slump
pushed the index to trade at less than 13 times estimated
earnings, making it the cheapest it’s been since August,
Bloomberg data show. Earnings are forecast to climb 17 percent
to $99.26 in 2011.  Before this week, the economic outlook had worsened,
including an increase in the  unemployment rate  to 9.1 percent.
Weakening data had pushed the Citigroup Economic Surprise Index
for the U.S. as low as minus 117.2, showing that reports were
missing projections by the most since January 2009.  Jobs, Housing Starts  Investors grew more optimistic as jobless claims fell to
414,000 last week, less than the median economist estimate,
according to the Labor Department. The Commerce Department said
housing starts in the U.S. increased more than forecast in May,
while retail sales declined less than estimated.  “When you look at the broad picture of data on the
economy, there’s been some weakening, but most of the data still
seems to be moving in a positive direction,” said Kevin Caron,
a market strategist in  Florham Park ,  New Jersey , at Stifel
Nicolaus & Co, which has $115 billion in client assets. “When
you look at the equity markets, there is something of an
advantage to be had.”  The S&P 500 had been on track for one of the longest slumps
in its history before this week. Since the New York Stock
Exchange shifted to a five-day week from six in 1952, the gauge
has posted one seven-week slump, in 1980, and two eight-week
declines, in 1970 and 2001, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. There have been five seven-week drops for the Dow.  Home Depot, McDonald’s  Home Depot advanced 3.2 percent to $34.53 this week.
McDonald’s gained 2.7 percent to $82.52, and Microsoft increased
2.3 percent to $24.26.  United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , which makes
Pratt & Whitney jet engines, gained after saying Boeing Co. will
likely opt to replace its 737 jetliner. The shares rose 2.3
percent to $84.57.  VF, the world’s largest apparel maker, said it’s buying
hiking-boot company Timberland for about $1.8 billion, or $43 a
share. The acquisition is the biggest in VF’s 112-year history.
Its shares advanced 12 percent, the most since March 2009, to
$102.80.  Shares of companies that have made acquisitions have beaten
their benchmark indexes following a takeover announcement a
majority of the time in eight of the past 12 years, according to
a Bloomberg analysis of more than 3,800 transactions worldwide.
The most recent three years have set records for gains. The
median reaction before 2009 was a 0.2 percentage point advance
over the benchmark, the data show.  Apple Executive Quits  J.C. Penney soared 15 percent to $34.29 and rose the most
in a day since 2000 on June 14. The third-largest U.S.
department-store chain said  Ron Johnson , who spearheaded the
creation of Apple’s retail chain, will become CEO this year.  Owens-Illinois, the world’s biggest maker of glass bottles,
cut its second-quarter profit margin forecast because of higher
costs and weaker demand in  Australia . The shares dropped 13
percent to $25.58.  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIMM)  plummeted 24 percent, the most
since September 2008, to $27.75. The maker of the BlackBerry
smartphone forecast second-quarter revenue and profit that
missed analysts’ estimates and said it will cut jobs as a lack
of new models prompts consumers to buy rival devices.  Moody’s Corp. (MCO)  slumped 12 percent, the most since September
2009, to $36.35. McGraw-Hill Cos. slipped 3 percent to $39.61.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange is considering fraud charges
over ratings of mortgage-backed assets, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter that it didn’t
identify.  Materials shares lost the most among 10 S&P 500 industries
this week. falling 2 percent. Defensive industries accounted for
three of the top four advances. Consumer staples climbed 1.2
percent as a group, while utilities increased 1 percent and
telecommunications companies rallied 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
