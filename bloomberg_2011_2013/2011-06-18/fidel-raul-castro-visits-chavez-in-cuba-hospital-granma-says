Former Cuban leader  Fidel Castro  and
his brother, current president Raul Castro, visited Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez yesterday at a hospital, Cuban state
newspaper  Granma  reported.  The Castro brothers discussed bilateral and international
issues with Chavez, who is “recovering satisfactorily” while
maintaining close contact with his cabinet on Venezuelan
affairs, Granma said. Photographs show Chavez, wearing a track
suit with the colors of his nation’s flag, talking and laughing
with the Castro brothers in a hospital room.  Chavez, 56, underwent surgery to remove a pelvic abscess
last week. Chavez told Telesur network by phone June 12 that he
decided to seek treatment in Cuba, the final stop in a tour of
allied governments in  Latin America , after feeling pain in his
abdomen while in Brasilia and  Ecuador .  To contact the reporter on this story:
