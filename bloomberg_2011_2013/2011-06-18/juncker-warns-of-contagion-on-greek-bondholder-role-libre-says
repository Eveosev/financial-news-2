Luxembourg’s Jean-Claude Juncker
said bondholder involvement in a new Greek aid package must be
structured carefully amid concerns about “substantial”
contagion effects,  La Libre Belgique  reported, citing an
interview.  Policy makers must reach agreement “on the form and
scope” of private-sector involvement in the next rescue package
for  Greece , Juncker, who leads the group of euro-area finance
ministers, told the newspaper. “This is one of the most
difficult questions because the contagion effects that are
feared are substantial.”  Juncker said finance ministers must craft a package that is
acceptable to the  European Central Bank , the credit-rating
companies and the financial markets, according to Le Libre. “If
we made a move that would be rejected by the ECB, by the rating
agencies and therefore the financial markets, we risk setting
the euro area aflame,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
