United Airlines resumed flights
today after a five-hour computer outage last night stranded
passengers in  Chicago , Denver,  San Francisco  and other U.S.
cities.  “The airline experienced a network connectivity issue at
about 7:15 p.m. local time, which was resolved through
troubleshooting procedures and restored at midnight,” the
airline said in a  statement  on its website today.  United canceled 15 flights yesterday and 16 today because
of the computer outage, spokeswoman Mary Clark said in an e-
mail. She said about 100 flights were delayed.  The disruption affected Chicago-based United’s flight
departures, airport processing and reservations systems,
including access to its website, the company said. NBC News in
Los Angeles reported passengers weren’t able to check in unless
they’d printed their boarding passes prior to arriving at the
airport.  The carrier waived change fees for customers at the
airports that were affected.  UAL Corp. merged with Continental Airlines Inc. in October,
surpassing Delta Airlines Inc. as the world’s biggest carrier
and becoming  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)   Separately,  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  had a two-hour computer
disruption this morning that temporarily suspended flights into
and out of Philadelphia International Airport, said spokeswoman
Tina Swail. She didn’t have further details on the problem,
though said it wasn’t related to United’s situation.  She wasn’t immediately able to say how many flights were
delayed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
