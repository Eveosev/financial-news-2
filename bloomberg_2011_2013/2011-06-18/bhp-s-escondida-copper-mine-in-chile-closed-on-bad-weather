BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s  Escondida  copper
mine in Chile, the world’s largest, was shut by heavy rain and
high winds.  “Operations will resume once weather conditions do not
represent a risk for employees,” a company spokesman said.  Winds as high as 45 knots (52 miles per hour) caused power
supply disruptions today in Chile and prompted the government to
shut the ports of Valparaiso, San Antonio and Quintero,
Santiago-based daily La Tercera  reported  on its website.  Codelco, the world’s largest copper company, hasn’t halted
operations at any of its mines, said a company official who
declined to be named citing company policy.  Andy Lloyd , a spokesman for  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , which
operates a mine adjacent to the Escondida mine, didn’t
immediately respond to a phone message or e-mail.  To contact the reporters on this story:
