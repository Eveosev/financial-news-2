Australia’s economic outlook is
strong because robust growth in the Asia region led by India and
 China  continues to drive demand for commodities, according to
Treasurer  Wayne Swan .  “Strong demand for our commodities is underpinning an
unprecedented pipeline of business investment,” Swan said in an
e-mailed statement. He was commenting after the International
Monetary Fund maintained its forecast for economic growth in
India and China in its  World Economic Outlook .  China’s economy is likely to grow 9.6 percent this year
while India gross domestic product will increase 8.2 percent,
the IMF said, adding that the downside risks for the global
economy have intensified. The Washington-based agency reduced
its growth forecast for the U.S. for the second time in two
months, warning that further setbacks to a recovery pose growing
threats to the world economy.  Swan said  Australia  is positioned to withstand risks of
further financial instability as the economy adds jobs and the
government reduces debt.  “Our economic scorecard remains the envy of the developed
world,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
