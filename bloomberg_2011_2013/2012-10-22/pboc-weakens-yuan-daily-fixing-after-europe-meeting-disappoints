The People’s Bank of China lowered
the  yuan ’s daily fixing for a second day following a European
Union summit that didn’t address the question of further aid for
debt-stricken Spain.  The PBOC set the  reference rate  0.03 percent weaker at
6.3071 per dollar, after strengthening it on each of the six
days through Oct. 18. The yuan, which can trade as much as 1
percent on either side of the fixing, closed little changed at
6.2547 in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The Chinese currency has advanced 2.3 percent
since reaching this year’s low of 6.3967 on July 25.  “It’s too early to tell from the weakening in the fixing
in the past two days if the central bank is slowing the pace of
appreciation,” said  Liu Dongliang , a Shenzhen-based senior
analyst at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest
lender.  Leaders at the Oct. 18-19 meeting didn’t discuss more
assistance for Spain, French President  Francois Hollande  told
reporters Oct. 19. Regional stocks fell today after the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index dropped by the most in four months on Oct. 19.  “No conclusion reached at the summit disappointed the
market,” Liu said.  One-month implied volatility in the yuan, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, decreased five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.50 percent.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency strengthened
0.02 percent to 6.2543 per dollar, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.02
percent to 6.3665. The contracts traded at a 1.8 percent
discount to the onshore rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
