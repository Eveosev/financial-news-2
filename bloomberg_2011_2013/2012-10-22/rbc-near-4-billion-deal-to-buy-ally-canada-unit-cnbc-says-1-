Royal Bank of Canada , the nation’s
largest lender by assets, is nearing a deal to buy  Ally
Financial Inc. (ALLY) ’s Canadian operations for more than $4 billion,
CNBC reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the
matter.  An agreement may be announced as soon as today, said the
broadcaster, which reported  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  is in the
bidding as well. Katherine Gay, a spokeswoman for Toronto-based
RBC, declined to comment, as did Gina Proia at Detroit-based
Ally and Toronto-Dominion Bank spokesman Stephen Knight.  Royal Bank and Toronto-Dominion are among lenders that have
shown interest in Ally’s Canadian operations, a person with
knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News last month. It’s
unclear whether Toronto-Dominion will make a higher offer, CNBC
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
