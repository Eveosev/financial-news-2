Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards advanced
by the most in almost a week on speculation foreign funds will
boost investments in local assets as consumption drives the
nation’s economic growth amid a global slowdown.  Government  debt holdings  were poised for a third straight
week of inflows, with overseas investors adding 4.27 trillion
rupiah ($444 million) this month through Oct. 18, Finance
Ministry data show. Global funds purchased $138 million more
local stocks than they sold last week, exchange data show. The
economy will grow 6.1 percent this year and 6.3 percent in 2013,
the  World Bank  said last week.  Bank Indonesia  maintained its
benchmark  interest rate  at a record-low 5.75 percent for an
eight month in October, the central bank said Oct. 11.  “Indonesia’s economy is attractive as growth is still
strong and is domestically driven,” said Klara Pramesti, a
research analyst in the treasury division at PT Bank Negara
Indonesia in Jakarta. “As long as the political and economic
situation remains stable, 10-year bond yields can dip lower than
even the  reference rate .”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards strengthened 0.1
percent to 10,122 per dollar as of 3:55 p.m. in Jakarta, the
biggest gain since Oct. 16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The contracts to buy or sell the rupiah in one year
traded at a 5.2 percent discount to the spot rate. Non-
deliverable forwards are settled in dollars.  The rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 9,600 per dollar, prices
from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied
volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to price
options, held at 6.25 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds maturing in
May 2022 was little changed at 5.76 percent, near a 10-week low
reached on Oct. 18, prices from the Inter Dealer Market
Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
