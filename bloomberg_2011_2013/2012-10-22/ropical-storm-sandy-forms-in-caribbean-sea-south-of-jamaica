Tropical Storm Sandy, the 18th named
system of the Atlantic season, churned across the Caribbean and
was forecast to grow to hurricane strength by tomorrow. A second
system was intensifying in the Atlantic.  Sandy, with winds of 45 miles (72 kilometers) per hour, was
325 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, according to a
National Hurricane Center  advisory  at 8 a.m.  New York  time. A
 hurricane watch  was issued by Jamaica’s government.  The storm, moving north-northeast at 3 mph, is forecast to
produce 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain across
Jamaica,  Haiti , the  Dominican Republic  and eastern Cuba,
according to the center. Some areas may be drenched by as much
as 16 inches.  “Tropical storm conditions are expected to reach Jamaica
tonight or early Wednesday, with hurricane conditions
possible,” the Miami-based center said. The storm is forecast
to move onto eastern Cuba tomorrow night, it said.  The naming of Sandy ties 2012 with 1969 as the fourth-most
active season on record. A 19th storm will probably develop from
a tropical depression east-northeast of the Leeward Islands that
has 35 mph winds. It’s not forecast to reach the U.S.  If that storm develops into a named system, 2012 will be
the third year in a row that 19 have formed in the Atlantic and
will become the third-most active season. In addition to 2010
and 2011, 1995 and 1887 also produced 19 storms, according to
 Weather Underground  in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The most active year was 2005, when 28 storms formed,
including  Hurricane Katrina  that devastated New Orleans.  The 19th Atlantic storm this year will be named Tony.  To contact the reporters on this story:
