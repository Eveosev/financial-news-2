Asian currencies weakened as the
sharpest decline in Japanese exports in more than a year
heightened concern that Europe’s debt crisis is sapping demand
for regional goods.  Thailand ’s baht slipped for a third day and South Korea’s
won retreated from near a one-year high after data today showed
shipments from Japan contracted 10.3 percent in September from a
year earlier. Asian equities fell after European leaders
attending an Oct. 18-19 summit in Brussels failed to provide
clarity on financial aid for Spain, while Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy  said he doesn’t feel under any pressure to seek a bailout.  “Japan’s export numbers add to the gloom,” said  Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank
Ltd. “The market is going to be rather wobbly.”  The baht fell 0.1 percent to 30.75 per dollar as of 3:33
p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
won weakened 0.1 percent to 1,104.25, Taiwan’s dollar dropped
0.1 percent to NT$29.320 and Indonesia’s rupiah declined for a
third day, losing 0.1 percent to 9,600.  The drop in Japanese  exports  was the steepest since May
2011 and was bigger than the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists for a 9.9 percent decline. Thailand reports
overseas sales data this week, while  South Korea  is due to
release third-quarter gross domestic product numbers and the
Philippines will review  interest rates .  Stocks Fall  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s most-active currencies, was little changed. Its 60-day
historical volatility fell to 2.34 percent from 2.37 percent on
Oct. 19. The MSCI  Asia Pacific Index (MXAPJ)  of shares dropped 0.3
percent, following a 1.7 percent slide in the S&P 500 Index of
U.S. stocks on Oct. 19 that was the biggest in four months.  “With disappointments over the European summit, and U.S.
stocks falling on weak housing data, the won is facing downward
pressure,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency analyst at Samsung
Futures Inc. in Seoul. There is “resistance” to won strength
after the currency touched 1,102.50 per dollar on Oct. 17, the
highest level since October 2011, she said.  The baht dropped before a government report on Oct. 24 that
may show Thai exports contracted 3 percent in September from a
year earlier, a fourth monthly decline, according to a Bloomberg
News survey of economists. Official data on Oct. 19 showed
foreign direct investment in  China  shrank for a fourth month.  Elsewhere, China’s  yuan  was little changed at 6.2547 per
dollar. Malaysia’s ringgit and the Philippine peso were steady
at 3.0548 and 41.397, respectively. Vietnam’s dong fell 0.1
percent to 20,853, while India’s rupee gained 0.3 percent to
53.6637.  To contact the reporters on this story:
