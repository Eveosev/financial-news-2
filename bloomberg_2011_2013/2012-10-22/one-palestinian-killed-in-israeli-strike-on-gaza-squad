Israeli military aircraft attacked
Palestinian militants in the  Gaza Strip , killing two of the men,
the Israeli army and a Palestinian official said.  The strike was the second today by the Israeli  Air Force 
against what the army spokesman’s office described in a press
release as rocket-launching squads in northern Gaza. The attacks
followed Palestinian mortar attacks into Israel, according to
the release.  The two Palestinians who died were hit in the second strike
after the first attack left four injured, according to Ashraf
al-Qedra, spokesman for the Hamas-run Ministry of Health. More
than 50 rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel this
month, an army spokeswoman said, speaking anonymously in
accordance with military regulations.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  reacted to the
Palestinian mortar fire, saying, “We won’t let anyone fire
missiles against us and imagine that he will enjoy immunity.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
