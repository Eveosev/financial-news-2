European  diesel  rose for a second
day as Morgan Stanley bought on the barge market. Total SA
purchased a cargo of the fuel for at least a sixth day.  Glencore International Plc sold a gasoil cargo for delivery
to  Greece . Vitol Group purchased two cargoes of naphtha,
bringing its total for the month to 24.  Light Products  Trafigura Beheer BV sold the naphtha lots at $938 and $947
a metric ton, according to a survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window.  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent narrowed for a second session
to $5.27 a barrel as of 1:21 p.m. local time, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and products broker in
 London . That compares with $5.54 on Oct. 19.  Barges of gasoline for loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp hub traded at $970 to $978 a ton, according to a similar
survey of the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with deals in
the previous session at $1,004 to $1,010 and is the lowest since
July 26, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Trafigura bought the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is
added to make finished fuel, for a sixth day. Barges usually
trade in lots of 1,000 tons to 2,000 tons.  The fuel’s crack fell to $4.67 a barrel from $4.79 in the
previous session, PVM data showed.  Middle Distillates  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold the shipment of diesel to Total
for delivery to Amsterdam,  Netherlands  at a $37 premium to
November gasoil on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London,
the Platts survey showed. That compares with deals to northwest
Europe on Oct. 19 at $33 and $39 more than gasoil futures.  On the barge market, diesel changed hands at premiums of
$43 to $45 to November gasoil, the survey showed. That’s up from
trades at $38 to $41 in the previous session.  Vitol bought the cargo of as much as 30,000 tons of heating
oil for delivery to Elefsis, Greece, at $2 less than benchmark
prices, according to the survey.  Heating oil barges traded at $11 and $12 more than November
gasoil, down from $14 on Oct. 18, the survey showed.  Money managers’ net-long bets on ICE gasoil futures and
options increased to 94,315 positions from 88,519 last week,
according to data from ICE Futures  Europe . That’s the highest
since at least the start of 2011 when Bloomberg starting
compiling the data.  Gasoil for November delivery dropped 2 percent to $977 a
ton as of 5:42 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. The
contract for December was at $962 a ton, narrowing its discount
to front-month to $15.  Gasoil’s crack , or premium to Brent, fell to $19.50 a
barrel as of 4:30 p.m. versus $19.97 on Oct. 19. Brent was
little changed at $110.05 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur  fuel oil  traded at $605.75 to $607.50 a ton,
the Platts survey showed. That’s less than deals in the previous
session at $611 to $612.50. The low-sulfur grade changed hands
at $637.50 to $638 a ton, down from $648 on Oct. 18.  Refineries  Unipetrol AS, the  Czech Republic ’s largest refiner, will
close its Kralupy refinery for at least 10 days because of a
shortage of crude oil from the TAL pipeline, which flows from
Trieste,  Italy , through  Austria  and into  Germany .  The refinery will shut Oct. 25 after crude from TAL stopped
Oct. 20 because Unipetrol processed more than planned, Mikulas
Duda, a company spokesman, said by telephone. The facility had
been scheduled for a shutdown in November. The plant can  process 
68,000 barrels of crude a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
