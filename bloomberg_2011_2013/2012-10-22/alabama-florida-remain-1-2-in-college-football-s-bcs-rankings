The University of Alabama and
University of Florida remain the top two teams in the Bowl
Championship Series rankings, while Kansas State climbed one
spot past fellow unbeaten  Oregon  into third.  Defending champion Alabama was No. 1 in the season debut of
the BCS standings last week, followed by  Southeastern Conference 
rival Florida. The Crimson Tide rolled to a 44-13 road win at
Tennessee two days ago and the Gators matched them at 7-0 with a
44-11 rout of then-seventh ranked South Carolina.  Alabama has a .963 rating out of 1.000 in the standings,
which are determined using the USA Today coaches’ poll, Harris
Interactive poll and six computer rankings. Florida is at .931.  Kansas State (7-0) jumped Oregon in the BCS after a 55-14
road victory at West Virginia, which had been ranked 13th.  Oregon is also 7-0 after opening a 43-7 halftime lead in
its 43-21 win at  Arizona  State on Oct. 18. Kansas State has a
.911 BCS average, with Oregon at .897.  Notre Dame  (7-0) is fifth in the BCS standings at .851,
followed by Louisiana State, which at 7-1 is the highest-ranked
one-loss team. Oregon State (6-0) is ranked seventh, followed by
Oklahoma (5-1), Southern California (6-1) and Georgia (6-1).  Unbeaten Mississippi State is ranked 11th, while  Rutgers
University  and Louisville -- also both 7-0 -- are 15th and 16th
in the BCS standings, respectively.  The top two teams in the final BCS standings on Dec. 2 will
play in the national championship game on Jan. 7 in Miami.
Alabama and Florida don’t play each other during the regular
season, yet could meet in the Southeastern Conference title game
on Dec. 1 if both remain atop their  respective divisions .  To contact the reporter on this story:
