The pound rose for the first time in
three days against the dollar after an industry report showed
the number of U.K. business insolvencies slid in September,
boosting optimism the economic recovery is strengthening.  Government bonds  fell, pushing 10-year yields toward the
highest in a month. The U.K. exited a recession in the third
quarter, with gross domestic product increasing 0.6 percent from
the previous three months, data due for release on Oct. 25 will
show, according to the median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Retail sales rose more than analysts
estimated in September, a report last week showed.  “The recent data have been relatively supportive for the
pound, showing there is a bottoming out of the economic cycle,”
said  Ulrich Leuchtmann , head of currency strategy at Commerzbank
AG in  Frankfurt . “GDP is the release this week that has the
potential to move the market because it will spur speculation
about what the Bank of England might do.”  The pound appreciated 0.1 percent to $1.6027 at 4:25 p.m.
London time, after declining 0.4 percent last week. Sterling
slipped 0.2 percent to 81.49 pence per euro. It touched 81.65
pence, the weakest level since June 11.  Insolvencies fell 3.1 percent from a year earlier to 1,679
companies, affecting 0.08 percent of all businesses, data from
Dublin-based  Experian Plc (EXPN)  showed. Bankruptcies at U.K. companies
with 26 to 50 employees fell 16 percent to 92 firms.  The pound will probably drop to $1.57 within a year,
Leuchtmann predicted.  Gilts Slide  Britain’s currency slid against the euro and the dollar
before  Bank of England  policy makers meet on Nov. 8. Minutes
released last week of their October gathering showed officials
were split on the need for more stimulus to boost the U.K.
economy even as they voted 9-0 to keep the bond-purchase target
at 375 billion.  Sterling slid 1 percent in the past three months, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro gained 4.2 percent and the
dollar dropped 3.7 percent.  GDP shrank 0.4 percent in the second quarter. It will
decrease 0.3 percent over the year, according to a separate
Bloomberg survey, the first annual contraction since 2009.  The 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.90 percent after climbing to 1.96 percent
on Oct. 18, the highest since Sept. 17.  Gilts have handed investors a return of 2 percent this year
through Oct. 19, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 2.5 percent, while Treasuries earned 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
