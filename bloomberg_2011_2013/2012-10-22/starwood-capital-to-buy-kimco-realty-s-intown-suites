Starwood Capital Group LLC, the real
estate investment firm led by Barry Sternlicht, agreed to buy
the InTown Suites extended-stay hotel chain from a  Kimco Realty
Corp. (KIM)  venture for $735 million, including debt.  The deal with the Starwood Distressed Opportunity Fund IX
should be completed in the first half of next year, New Hyde
Park, New York-based Kimco said in a statement today. The sale
price includes about $617 million of existing debt.  Kimco, the largest U.S. owner of community shopping
centers, has been selling non-retail investments to focus on its
main business. The company owns a 75 percent interest in InTown
Hospitality Investors LP, the venture that owns InTown Suites.
The portfolio is composed of 138 extended-stay properties
predominantly in the southern U.S., with concentrations in
Texas, Georgia and  Florida .  Sternlicht was chairman and CEO of  Starwood Hotels &
Resorts Worldwide Inc. (HOT) , a company he founded, from 1995 to 2005.
In 1991, he created Starwood Capital, a Greenwich, Connecticut-
based firm whose investments have included the Carlyle Hotel in
New York and the Paramount Bay residential tower in Miami,
according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
