Peru ’s benchmark sol-denominated
bonds fell, pushing up yields to a three-week high, as investors
bought longer-duration securities on bets the fastest economic
growth in South America won’t stir inflation pressures.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 4.27 percent at 12:58 p.m. in Lima,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price declined
0.2 centimo to 123.31 centimos per sol.  Investors are buying higher-yielding bonds in Peru on bets
the central bank will keep its benchmark  interest rate  at 4.25
percent as inflation stays under control even as the economy
expands 6 percent this year, said  Enrique Alvarez , the head of
 Latin America  fixed-income research at IdeaGlobal.  “It’s quite simply a function of capturing a little more
yield for a longer period of time,” Alvarez said in a phone
interview from New York. “Growth is still quite good in
comparison to the rest of Latin America, but there are no
hurdles or obstacles thrown up by that.”  The yield on the nation’s August 2031 sol bond fell two
basis points to 5.12 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  Inflation was low in the first half of October and the
annual rate will probably return to policy makers’ target range
this year, central bank President Julio Velarde told Congress
last week.  Consumer prices rose 0.54 percent last month and climbed
3.74 percent from a year earlier, the national statistics agency
said Oct. 1. The central bank targets annual inflation of 2
percent plus or minus 1 percent.  Peru will be South America’s fastest growing economy in
2012 and 2013, expanding 6 percent and 5.8 percent respectively,
according to the  International Monetary Fund .  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5770 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
