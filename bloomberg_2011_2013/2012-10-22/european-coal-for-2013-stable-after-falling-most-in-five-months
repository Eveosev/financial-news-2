European coal for next year was
little changed after falling the most in almost five months.  Thermal coal for 2013 delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp traded at $95.55 a metric ton as of 3:40 p.m. in  London ,
according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract
earlier fell as much as 1.7 percent to $94 a metric ton, its
steepest decline since May 31.  Bloomberg tracks information supplied by ICAP Plc, GFI
