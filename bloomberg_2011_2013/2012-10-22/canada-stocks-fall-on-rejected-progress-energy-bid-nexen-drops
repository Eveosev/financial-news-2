Canadian stocks fell after the
government blocked Petroliam Nasional Bhd.’s C$5.2 billion
($5.23 billion) takeover of  Progress Energy (PRQ)  Resources Corp.,
casting doubts on Cnooc Ltd.’s bid for  Nexen Inc. (NXY)   Energy companies fell the most among 10 industry groups,
sinking 1.2 percent, as Progress Energy and Nexen slumped more
than 5.1 percent. Gold companies gained as a rebound in the
metal’s price helped send  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  up 1.4 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  lost 39.63
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,376.35 at 11:36 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark gauge is up 0.5 percent in October, poised for the
fifth consecutive month of gains, the longest streak since
February 2011.  “The government objection has caused concern across the
board in the oil and gas patch,” Robert McWhirter, portfolio
manager with Selective Asset Management Inc. in Toronto, said in
a phone interview. His firm manages about C$60 million. “People
are having second thoughts as to whether those other specific
acquisitions might go ahead,” he said. Gold “is  what appears
to be the only visible ray of sunshine in the background at this
moment.”  Progress Energy slumped 11 percent to C$19.26. Industry
Minister Christian Paradis said in a statement that he wasn’t
satisfied the acquisition by Petroliam Nasional, Malaysia’s
state oil company known as Petronas, is in Canada’s interest.
Prime Minister  Stephen Harper ’s Conservative government reviewed
the bid under its foreign takeover law, which says transactions
must be judged to have a “net benefit” to Canada.  Investors say the rejection is a test case for the $15.1
billion bid by Cnooc of China for Nexen. Shares of the Calgary-
based oil and natural gas producer dropped 5.1 percent to
C$23.87.  Encana Sinks  Encana Corp. (ECA) , Canada’s largest natural gas producer that
was touted as a takeover target for Exxon Mobil Corp., slipped
3.9 percent to C$22.86. Encana is a natural fit for the largest
U.S. energy company, Kevin Kaiser, energy analyst at Hedgeye
Risk Management, an independent investment research firm based
in New Haven, Connecticut, said last week.  Gold producers gained as the metal’s prices rebounded from
a six-week low. Barrick, the world’s largest gold producer,
advanced 1 percent to C$38.94.  Goldcorp Inc. (G)  added 0.4 percent
to C$43.23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
