Water utilities should adopt pricing
structures that encourage consumers to curb water use in order
to meet demand that industry leaders say may outstrip supply by
2030, according to a survey by  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)   The survey of 244 senior water utility executives found
wasteful consumer behavior to be the biggest barrier in meeting
rising demand that’s also driven by growing populations and
climate change, Oracle said in the report released today.  “The threat of water scarcity is not an insurmountable
challenge but to overcome it, water utilities will need to make
much more productive use of water available and better educate
their customers about its value,”  Brian Gardner , senior editor
at the Economist Intelligence Unit,  said in a statement
accompanying the report.  The study showed 49 percent of the respondents believe
pricing structures need changing to prompt consumers to conserve
water while 38 percent said prices should be held down to
increase access to the resource, according to the study
conducted by the EIU.  More than a third of the executives surveyed said the risk
of demand outstripping supply by 2030 is “highly likely” or
“essentially certain,” according to the study. Failure to take
action could lead to “significant economic, social and health
implications,” according to Oracle, based in  Redwood City ,
 California .  Oracle, the biggest maker of  database software , provides
smart meter management software to Veolia and Suez Environnement
in  France , the largest water companies.  Most water utilities are increasing investments to meet
supply challenges, with 22 percent surveyed boosting spending by
15 percent or more in the next three years, according to the
survey. The biggest risks facing utilities are drought and
increased water pollution, according to the study, which said
half of those surveyed found government support lacking to
address water scarcity.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
