Philippine bonds rose as economists
forecast the central bank will cut  interest rates  this week for
a fourth time in 2012 to support growth. The peso weakened.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will reduce its overnight
borrowing rate by a quarter of a percentage point to a record-
low 3.5 percent on Oct. 25, according to 11 of 18 analysts
 surveyed  by Bloomberg. The rest see no change. Policy makers
have room to lower borrowing costs, Governor Amando Tetangco
said in an Oct. 10 interview in  Tokyo . The Philippine Star
reported on Oct. 14, citing Tetangco, that a rate cut could help
the monetary authority manage capital inflows.  “We’re expecting the market to be bullish in the coming
days, especially with a rate cut in sight,” said Jan Briace Santos, a fixed-income trader who helps manage the equivalent of
$17 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in  Manila . “There is
room for yields to go down.”  The yield on the 6.375 percent bonds due January 2022 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.69 percent as of
4:36 p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services.  Gross domestic product increased 5.9 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, slowing from 6.3 percent in the
previous three months. Inflation eased to 3.6 percent in
September from 3.8 percent the prior month.  The peso was little changed at 41.397 per dollar in Manila,
data from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. The currency touched a
four-year high of 41.120 on Oct. 18. One-month implied
volatility, which measures exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was unchanged at 5.25 percent.  The government sold a record 188 billion pesos ($4.5
billion) of bonds targeted at individual investors by the close
of the offering on Oct. 18, which was earlier than the original
plan for the sale to end Oct. 22, Treasurer  Roberto Tan  said on
Oct. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
