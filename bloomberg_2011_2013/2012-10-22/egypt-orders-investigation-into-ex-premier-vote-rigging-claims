Egypt ’s prosecutor-general has
ordered an investigation into a lawsuit filed by former
presidential candidate Ahmed Shafik alleging violations in the
elections in May, the Cairo Court of Appeals said in a faxed
statement today.  The move comes one day after the government barred Shafik,
who served as ousted President  Hosni Mubarak ’s last premier,
from accessing his assets.  Shafik, who left Egypt after narrowly losing the
presidential run-off race to Islamist Mohamed Mursi earlier this
year, is being investigated on a number of corruption-related
charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
