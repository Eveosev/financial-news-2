President  Barack Obama  leads  Mitt
Romney  among likely voters in Ohio by five percentage points, 50
percent to 45 percent, according to a Quinnipiac University/CBS
News poll released today.  That’s a decline for the president from last month’s poll,
where he led his Republican challenger by 10 percentage points,
53 percent to 43 percent.  The new poll shows the president maintaining a strong lead
among female voters, 55 percent to 40 percent, while Romney
leads among men, 51 percent to 44 percent.  “The good news for Governor Romney is that he has sliced
President Obama’s lead in Ohio in half in the last month,”
Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University
Polling Institute, said in a statement accompanying the poll.
“The bad news for Romney, and the good news for Obama, is that
no Republican has ever won the White House without carrying  Ohio 
and the challenger is running out of time to make up the
remaining difference.”  The telephone poll of 1,548 likely voters was conducted
Oct. 17-20 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
