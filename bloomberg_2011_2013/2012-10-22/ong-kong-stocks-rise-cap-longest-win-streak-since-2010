Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index capped
its longest winning streak since 2010 after the city’s de facto
central bank stepped in for the first time since 2009 to prevent
the currency from rising against the U.S. dollar as funds flow
into the market.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. (388) , the world’s second-
largest bourse operator by market value, advanced 3.5 percent
amid optimism the flow of funds into the city will lead to
higher turnover.  China Mobile (941)  Ltd., the world’s biggest phone
company by subscribers, gained 1.1 percent after a report the
company raised its 2012 profit target. PetroChina Co., Asia’s
biggest company by value, fell 1.3 percent after oil prices
fell.  The Hang Seng Index rose 0.7 percent to 21,697.55 at the
close, its eighth straight day of gains and the longest streak
since July 2010. Three stocks climbed for each that dropped on
the 49-member index. Volume was 12 percent below the 30-day
intraday average. The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index of
mainland companies advanced 0.6 percent to 10,742.79.  “There is some hot money coming into Hong Kong on
expectation there will be a bottoming out of China’s economy,”
said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities in
Hong Kong. “That would help support the market. It’s only the
first sign of hot money going into Hong Kong. There will be more
to come. From a technical point of view, the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  is
overbought, so maybe it could go into a correction.”  Relative Strength  The Hong Kong equity benchmark’s so-called 14-day  relative-
strength index  was at 77 today, the strongest since October 2010
and a level that indicates to some analysts that prices may
fall. The gauge rose 2 percent last week, capping its seventh-
straight weekly gain, as better-than-expected economic reports
from the U.S. and China boosted confidence.  The Hang Seng Composite Index, the city’s broadest measure
of stock performance capped its longest streak of advances since
January 2010 today. Mainland companies made up 56 percent of
Hong Kong’s market capitalization at September 30, bourse
operator Hong Kong Exchanges  reported .  The Hang Seng Index  traded  at 11.3 times average estimated
earnings at the end of last week, compared with 13.7 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The cost of options to protect against losses in Chinese
stocks fell to the lowest level in six years as investors bet
new leaders may do more to encourage growth after a seven-
quarter slowdown.  Skew Plunges  Puts protecting against a 10 percent drop in the  Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  cost 1.04 times more than calls betting
on a 10 percent advance, according to data on one-month options
compiled by Bloomberg. The price relationship, known as skew,
plunged to 1.01 on Oct. 15, the lowest since March 2006.  Futures on the S&P 500 climbed 0.2 percent today. The gauge
fell 1.7 percent on Oct. 19 after Microsoft Corp. and General
Electric Co. reported earnings that missed estimates.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said it bought $603
million at HK$7.75 per dollar, which is the so-called strong
side of the permitted convertibility range of HK$7.75 to HK$7.85
that obligates intervention. The move, announced in an e-mailed
statement on Oct. 20, was confirmed by spokeswoman Rhonda Lam,
who said the authority acted during New York trading hours.  Hong Kong Exchanges gained 3.5 percent to HK$125.60, the
 steepest gain  in the Hang Seng Index. Weekly  turnover  on the
bourse’s main board rose for a second week on Oct. 19 after four
consecutive declines.  ‘Hot Money’  “We expect the turnover to increase,” with the so-called
“hot money” coming into Hong Kong, said First Shanghai’s Yip.
“There will be at least a certain amount going into the Hong
Kong stock market, and it will help the market sentiment.”  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800) , a solar-power company,
jumped 4.5 percent to HK$1.40, extending last week’s surge. The
shares jumped 14 percent in the five days ended Oct. 19 after
the Shanghai Securities News reported that China may issue more
policies to support the industry.  China Mobile rose 1.1 percent to HK$85.45. The company
raised its 2012 profit target by 10 billion  yuan  ($1.6 billion)
at an internal meeting held Oct. 19, Chinese-language news
portal Sina.com reported, without citing where it got the
information. The company doesn’t give out earnings guidance,
spokeswoman Rainie Lei said by phone today.  Among stocks that fell, PetroChina lost 1.3 percent to
HK$10.94 after crude oil for November delivery lost 2.2 percent
to settle at $90.05 a barrel in New York on Oct. 19.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index rose 0.6 percent to 21,681.
The  HSI Volatility Index (VHSI)  rose 6.7 percent to 15.92. The level
indicates traders expect a swing of 4.6 percent for the equity
benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
