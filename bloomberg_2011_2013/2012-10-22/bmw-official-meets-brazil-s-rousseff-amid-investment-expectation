Brazil’s President Dilma Rousseff will
meet with officials from  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  today
following reports the German carmaker is preparing to invest in a
new assembly plant.  BMW will build the factory in the southern state of Santa
Catarina, the state government said in a statement posted on its
website today. The company did not immediately respond to e-mails
and telephone requests for comment from  Bloomberg News .  The factory will require an investment of 1 billion reais
($493 million) and initially generate 1,500 jobs, the government
said in the statement. BMW Sales Chief  Ian Robertson  will meet
with Rousseff at 3 p.m. Brasilia time, according to the
president’s agenda.  Rousseff’s administration on Oct. 4 announced tax breaks for
carmakers that increase investments in Brazil in a bid to revive
its shrinking manufacturing industry.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  has said that auto companies
will invest $22 billion over the next three years in Brazil.
Automakers will have to meet tougher environmental, safety and
fuel efficiency standards in order to get additional tax breaks,
he said on Oct.4.  In May, the government cut the IPI tax on cars, helping drive
vehicle sales from this year’s low of 249,500 in February to a
record high 420,100 in August, according to the national car
dealership association. In September, car sales fell 31 percent
from the previous month.  Editors: Harry Maurer, Philip Sanders  To contact the reporter on this story:
