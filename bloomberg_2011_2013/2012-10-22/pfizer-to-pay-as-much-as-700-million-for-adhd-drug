Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s biggest
drugmaker, agreed to pay as much as $700 million to buy NextWave
Pharmaceuticals Inc., the closely held maker of a medicine to
treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  The deal includes an initial $255 million and as much as
$425 million in milestone payments depending on how well
NextWave’s liquid ADHD drug, Quillivant XR, sells,  New York- 
based Pfizer said in a statement today. Pfizer had paid
Cupertino, California-based NextWave $20 million in the second
quarter as part of an option to buy the company.  NextWave’s formulation was approved by U.S. regulators on
Oct. 1. It’s a liquid form of attention-deficit drugs such as
Novartis AG’s Focalin that no longer have patent protection.  “This agreement demonstrates our focused expansion of the
Established Products U.S. brands business,” Albert Bourla,
president of Pfizer’s Established Products unit, said in the
statement.  Pfizer has been shedding non-drug units like its animal
health and nutritionals businesses as Chief Executive Officer
 Ian Read  focuses the company on developing new prescription
medicines. The drugmaker’s  shares  fell less than 1 percent to
$25.60 at the close of  New York  trading.  Jefferies Group Inc. acted as financial adviser to Pfizer,
while Aquilo Partners LP was NextWave’s adviser, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
