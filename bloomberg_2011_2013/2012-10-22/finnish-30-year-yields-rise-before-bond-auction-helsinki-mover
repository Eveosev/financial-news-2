Finland ’s 30-year bond yields rose
and spreads widened ahead of an auction in which the
northernmost euro member plans to sell more of its 10-year and
30-year bonds.  The yield on the 2.625 percent note maturing in 2042 rose
five basis points to 2.64 percent at 2:48 p.m. in Helsinki
today. The asset swap spread for the note was at 19.32 basis
points, compared with a low of 11 basis points last week. The
note is trading above its three-month average of 2.489 percent,
along with similar-maturity Dutch and German debt.  Finnish yields have risen since the  European Central Bank ’s
pledge to buy bonds helped calm markets and reduced the appeal
of so-called haven assets. Finland, rated AAA at Moody’s
Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, had
negative yields on its two-year bonds during much of the summer
as Europe’s debt crisis threatened to engulf  Spain .  “Issuance of Finnish  government bonds  is expected to
decline in 2013, which will support the technically strong
supply/demand balance for a true AAA” issuer, Jens Peter Soerensen, chief analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Copenhagen, wrote
in a note on Oct. 19. He recommends clients buy the 30-year
notes relative to the Danish government bond maturing in 2039
and the 30-year euro swap.  Finland plans to raise as much as 1.5 billion euros ($2
billion) in the auction. It has 4 billion euros in 10-year notes
and 1.5 billion euros of 30-year bonds outstanding. The auction
is due to be held at 12:30 p.m. in Helsinki tomorrow, with
results expected at 1:02 p.m., the Treasury said on Oct 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
