OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s state-owned
crude producer, is breaking its link in the stock market with
government-run  OAO Gazprom (OGZPY)  as the  oil company  pursues a takeover
that will boost output in line with  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)   Rosneft, based in Moscow, rose the most last week in a
month in  London  trading, pushing its 120-day correlation
coefficient with Gazprom to 0.52 on Oct. 19, the lowest in four
months. The rally sent Rosneft shares to 7 times estimated
earnings, the widest premium versus Gazprom since November 2010.
The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of New York-traded Russian
shares climbed 0.3 percent last week to 98.19.  Rosneft agreed to buy  BP Plc (BP/) ’s half of its TNK-BP venture
for $26.8 billion in cash and shares, according to a statement
today. The Russian company also has an agreement to buy the
other half of TNK-BP from a group of billionaires for $28
billion in cash. Absorbing BP’s Russian venture raises Rosneft’s
crude production to match that of Irving, Texas-based Exxon.
Gazprom, Russia’s dominant energy company, expects 2012 output
to drop more than forecast on shrinking European demand.  “I would choose Rosneft over Gazprom because the premium
should widen over time,”  Ed Kuczma , who helps manage $38
billion at Van Eck Associates Corp. and its  Market Vectors
Russia ETF (RSX) , said by phone from  New York  on Oct. 19. “While
Gazprom is facing declining demand in  Europe , Rosneft offers
much more room for upside.”  Rosneft’s Moscow-traded shares jumped as much as 3.1
percent to 220.80 rubles after today’s announcement, before
paring their advance to 1.1 percent by 4:05 p.m. The stock
climbed 0.7 percent in London to $6.98. Gazprom, the world’s
biggest natural gas producer, added 0.3 percent in Moscow and
was little changed in London at $9.99.  Matching Exxon  RTS Index futures  due in December climbed 0.3 percent to
149,140 in Moscow. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index fell 1.3
percent to 98.19 on Oct. 19, trimming its weekly gain to 0.3
percent.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the biggest U.S. exchange-
traded fund that holds Russian shares, sank 1.7 percent to
$28.91 on Oct. 19, cutting the weekly advance to 0.7 percent.
The RTS Volatility Index fell 2.6 percent to 24.99 at the end of
last week in New York.  Crude oil for November delivery rose 0.6 percent today to
$90.56 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Futures are
down 8.3 percent this year. Brent for December settlement added
0.3 percent to $110.45 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, while Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, added
0.2 percent to $109.35 per barrel, after dropping 2.9 percent
last week.  Boost Output  The purchase of TNK-BP would increase Rosneft’s crude
production to about 4.5 million barrels, and boost its market
value to rival Gazprom’s 3.7 trillion rubles ($120 billion).
Exxon, the world’s biggest oil company, pumped the equivalent of
4.15 million barrels of crude a day during the April-to-June
period.  “There’s pretty good reason to believe that having BP as a
major partner can really improve things for Rosneft,”  Roland Nash , the head investment strategist at Verno Capital, which
manages $200 million in Russian securities, said by phone from
Moscow on Oct. 19.  Rosneft’s 120-day correlation with Moscow-based Gazprom has
stayed above 0.6 for the most of the last four years, after
reaching a record-high 0.86 on September 2008. A reading of 1
means prices are moving in lockstep, while zero implies no
relationship between the two benchmarks.  Energy Power  American depositary receipts of Gazprom lost 0.6 percent to
$9.95 in New York on Oct. 19, reducing their weekly advance to
1.7 percent. The ADRs settled at a 0.6 percent discount versus
the company’s Moscow stock. Gazprom slipped 0.5 percent to
154.57 rubles, or $5. One ADR is equal to two ordinary shares.  Vladimir Putin , who returned to Russia’s presidency for a
third term in May, has used Gazprom to assert Russia’s energy
power during his first eight years in the Kremlin, winning
pipeline deals and controlling former Soviet allies.  ADRs of  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s second-biggest oil producer
after Rosneft, retreated 1.6 percent to $63.62 on Oct. 19.,
shrinking the advance to 2.6 percent on the week. The  stock  was
little changed at 1,974.60 rubles, or $63.74, in Moscow today.  Oil may decline this week as U.S. inventories rose to the
highest level for this time of year in at least 30 years,
heightening concern that supply is outpacing demand.  Nineteen of 33 analysts, or 58 percent, forecast crude will
decrease through Oct. 26. Seven respondents, or 21 percent,
predicted a gain and seven forecast little change. Last week, 46
percent of analysts projected a decline.  Google Slump  Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s biggest Internet company, was the worst
performer on the Bloomberg Russia-US gauge last week, declining
4.5 percent. Yandex slid 0.8 percent to $22.24 on Oct. 19 after
 Google Inc. (GOOG)  reported profit and sales that missed analysts’
estimates the day before.  “Google impacts the entire sector, including Yandex,”
Alexander Vengranovich, an analyst at Otkritie Financial Corp.,
said by phone from Moscow on Oct. 19. “People get nervous. They
view Google’s results as an early indication of a slowdown in
revenue for Internet companies.”  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
gained 0.7 percent to HK$4.40 in Hong Kong trading today. The
MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.3 percent today as Japanese
exports fell more than economists estimated and corporate
earnings missed forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
