The South African Competition
Commission recommended approving  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) â€™s
planned takeover of  Xstrata Plc (XTA) , subject to curbs on job losses.  Glencore agreed to limit cuts to 80 workers or less, made
up of managers and specialists, the panel said in a statement.
The company placed a moratorium on 100 lower-level job losses
for two years after the planned merger is approved.  The panel makes recommendations on corporate mergers and
acquisitions to the Competition Tribunal for final approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
