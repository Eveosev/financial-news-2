The U.K. may consider seeking to
close a loophole that allows buyers of European Union aviation-
only carbon allowances to convert them to regular permits that
can be used by factories and power stations from 2013.  “We are aware that the registry regulation appears to
permit Phase 2 EU aviation allowances to be converted into
ordinary Phase 3 allowances,” the Department of Energy and
Climate Change said today in an e-mailed response to questions.
“We don’t think this was the original intention and we are
discussing this issue with other member states in the context of
current registry regulation amendment discussions.”  Konrad Hanschmidt, an analyst at Bloomberg New Energy
Finance in  London , said it was unfortunate that discussions on a
potential amendment to the rules were taking place so close to
the date of the conversion.  “The information has been available for a long time now
and many have probably made investment decisions based on
this,” Hanschmidt said in an e-mail. “Even an expression of
such a possibility, without an actual decision, undermines the
market’s visibility and confidence that is already weakened by
the ongoing backloading negotiations.”  EU aviation permits issued in Phase 2 of the bloc’s carbon
market, which ends in 2012, may be converted into Phase 3
permits after the end of the 2012 compliance process in  April. (APR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
