Spain  had a relatively wet September
with warmer than usual temperatures, the  Agriculture Ministry ’s
weather service reported.  Average rainfall in the month for the country was 57
millimeters (2.2 inches), about 35 percent higher than normal
September precipitation of 43 millimeters, the ministry wrote in
a  report  on its website today.  Last month’s wetter weather follows Spain’s second-driest
summer in 60 years. The country’s wheat crop fell an estimated
26 percent this year, while barley output may have dropped 27
percent, the Agriculture Ministry reported earlier this month.  Temperatures were an average 20.9 degrees Celsius (69.6
degrees Fahrenheit) last month, 0.6 degrees above normal, the
ministry wrote. The highest temperature for the month of 38.2
degrees Celsius was recorded on Sept. 12 at Cordoba airport,
