Adam Parker , the most pessimistic
strategist on  Wall Street , said he was too bearish on U.S.
equities after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 13
percent this year.  Parker, the New York-based U.S. equity strategist at Morgan
Stanley, has predicted since the beginning of 2012 that the
benchmark index for American stocks would sink 7.2 percent to
end the year at 1,167, the lowest among strategists polled by
Bloomberg. The  S&P 500  recently traded at 1,426, poised for the
biggest annual gain since 2009.  Stocks climbed this year as the  European Central Bank 
announced an unlimited bond-buying program and the  Federal
Reserve  introduced a third round of asset purchases to stimulate
economic growth while pledging to keep its target interest rates
near zero through at least mid-2015.  “We were wrong on our year-end outlook for 2012 mostly
because of our view on the multiple, but also because we didn’t
view the bull case as being more probable than the bear case,”
Parker wrote in a note today. “The specter of nearly unlimited
intervention from the ECB and the Fed seems to have created a
more positive asymmetry than we anticipated a year ago.”  Parker said “a more balanced bull-bear ratio seems
appropriate” when making forecasts for 2013. While he hasn’t
made a price projection for the S&P 500, he expects companies in
the index to earn $98.71 a share next year. That’s lower than
the average forecast of $106.27 from strategists in a Bloomberg
survey.  2013 Predictions  Wall Street strategists so far are unanimous in predicting
the S&P 500 will reach a record next year, according to the five
firms that have made predictions out of 15 tracked by Bloomberg.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s David Kostin and Bank of Montreal’s
 Brian Belski  expect the S&P 500 will climb to 1,575 in 2013.
That compared with predictions of 1,600 by Bank of America
Corp.’s Savita Subramanian, 1,615 by Tobias Levkovich at
Citigroup Inc. and 1,585 by Oppenheimer & Co.’s John Stoltzfus.  The S&P 500 needs to increase 9.2 percent from last week’s
close to reach its all-time high of 1,565.15 set Oct. 9, 2007.  Per-share profits have exceeded analysts’ estimates at
about 69 percent of the 123 companies in the S&P 500 that
 released results  for the third quarter, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings have increased 0.9 percent for
the group on a 1.9 percent gain in sales.  The S&P 500 is trading at 14.4 times reported earnings over
the past 12 months, up from 13.7 at the end of 2011 and compared
with an average  income multiple  of 16.4 over the last five
decades, based on data tracked by Bloomberg.  “We are still deeply worried about the structural issues
facing the U.S., but the market has not been anticipatory,”
Parker said. “Investing predicated on a sustained level of
investor complacency is worrisome, but potentially apropos.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
