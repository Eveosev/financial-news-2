American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the insurer that counts the U.S. as its largest shareholder,
agreed to pay $25 million to $30 million to settle a California
review into whether the company held funds that should go to
beneficiaries.  The deal requires the New York-based insurer to check the
Social Security Administrationâ€™s Death Master File to determine if
policyholders have died, according to a statement today from
California Controller John Chiang and Insurance Commissioner  Dave Jones .  To contact the reporter on this story:
