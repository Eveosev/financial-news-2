Pork inventories in the U.S. climbed
28 percent at the end of September from a year earlier to the
highest in almost a century, the government said, as rising feed
costs prompted producers to send more animals to slaughter.  Warehouses held 630.7 million pounds of pork, up from 491.9
million on Sept. 30, 2011, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said today in a report. The figure is the highest for the end of
September since the USDA started tracking the figure in 1915.
Inventories rose 7.7 percent from the end of August.  The price of corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed,
jumped 18 percent this year before today, as the worst drought
since 1956 damaged yield prospects. The USDA is projecting the
smallest crop in six years. Meatpackers processed an estimated
89.211 million hogs this year through Oct. 20, up 2.1 percent
from a year earlier, USDA data show. Feed costs are probably
prompting producers to send animals to slaughter at an
“accelerated pace,” Doug Houghton, an analyst at Brock
Associates in  Milwaukee , said in an interview before the report.  “Excessive September production very likely boosted pork
stocks substantially,”  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught Futures
Insights in Altus,  Arkansas , said in an e-mailed report.  Hog futures for December settlement fell 0.9 percent to
78.875 cents a pound at 12:54 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices were down 5.5 percent this year through Oct.
19.  As of Sept. 30, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, rose 79 percent from a year earlier to
16.7 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham surged 31 percent from a year earlier to 213.9
million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of September were 2.7
percent smaller than a year earlier at 651.7 million pounds, the
USDA said. Beef supplies fell 0.5 percent to 425.6 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
