Colombia ’s peso bond yields held at
a record low on speculation policy makers will reduce borrowing
costs as soon as this week after reports indicated that the
Andean nation’s economy is slowing.  The yield on the 8 percent peso-denominated debt due in
October 2015 closed little changed at 5.05 percent, according to
the central bank, the lowest level on a closing basis since the
securities were first sold in 2006.  “Data are pretty conclusive that the economy is slowing,”
said Juan Camilo Santana, an analyst at Cia. de Profesionales de
Bolsa brokerage. “Given also what is happening in the global
economy, the central bank needs to cut the rate once more to
provide greater stimulus.”  Future rate decisions will depend on global growth and the
domestic economy, Colombia’s central bank said in minutes of its
Sept. 28 meeting that were published Oct. 12. Policy makers held
the target lending rate at 4.75 percent after two cuts since
June from 5.25 percent. The next meeting is Oct. 26.  Industrial production fell 1.9 percent in August from a
year earlier, the government’s statistics agency reported Oct.
18. The median forecast among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for a 1.1 percent increase. Retail sales rose 1.2 percent that
month from a year earlier, trailing the median forecast calling
for 1.7 percent expansion.  The peso depreciated 0.6 percent to 1,808.60 per  U.S.
dollar  today, paring its rally this year to 7.2 percent.  The local currency will weaken to as low as 1,850 by year-
end as foreign companies in Colombia repatriate revenue, Santana
forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
