Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. (OSG) , the
largest U.S. tanker company, plunged to a record in  New York 
trading after  saying  it’s evaluating options including filing
for  Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .  The shares slumped as much as 63 percent to $1.21 and were
at $1.355 as of 10:17 a.m. local time, valuing the company at
$41.5 million. Its $300 million of 8.125 percent notes due March
2018 dropped 14.75 cents to 37 cents on the dollar as of 9:19
a.m., according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The  company said  Oct. 3 it was reviewing a tax issue
arising from its being domiciled in the U.S. and has substantial
international operations, and relating to the interpretation of
provisions in its loan agreement. It said Oct. 19 the board’s
audit committee concluded the company’s financial statements for
at least the three years ended Dec. 31, 2011, and associated
interim periods, and for the fiscal quarters ended March 31 and
June 30, 2012, should no longer be relied upon.  Overseas Shipholding said it’s evaluating if it will need
to restate for those periods. Because of those, and other
matters, including negotiations with bank creditors, Overseas
Shipping said it’s evaluating options including filing for
Chapter 11 protection.  Rates for very large crude carriers, each hauling 2 million
barrels of oil, plunged 55 percent to $14,320 a day this year,
according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest shipbroker.  “I don’t think it will impact the broader tanker market,”
said Doug Mavrinac, a shipping companies analyst at Jefferies &
Co. in Houston. “Those assets aren’t going anywhere. We saw a
filing last year that didn’t have any impact in the market, and
I don’t think OSG would either.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
