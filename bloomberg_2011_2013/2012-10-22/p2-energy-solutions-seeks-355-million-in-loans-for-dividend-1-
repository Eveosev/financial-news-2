P2 Energy Solutions Inc. is seeking
$355 million of loans to refinance debt and fund a distribution
to shareholders, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction.  Jefferies Group Inc. is arranging the financing for the
Denver-based company which will consist of a $220 million first-
lien term loan, a $110 million second-lien piece and a $25
million revolving line of credit, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the information is private. The bank
will host a lender meeting the morning of Oct. 25, according to
the person.  Leverage, or debt to earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, will be 5.7 times total, the
person said.  P2 Energy, which is controlled by Vista Equity Partners
LLC, provides software and data services to the oil and gas
industry. For the fiscal year ending on Sept. 30, the company
generated revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $147.8 million and
$57.5 million, respectively, according to the person.  Chad Martin, chief financial officer of P2 Energy
Solutions, didnâ€™t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment.  First-lien debt is repaid first in a bankruptcy or
liquidation, second-lien debt is repaid next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
