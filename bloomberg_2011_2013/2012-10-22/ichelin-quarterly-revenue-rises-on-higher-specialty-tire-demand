Michelin & Cie (ML) , the world’s second-
largest tiremaker, said third-quarter revenue rose 5.7 percent
on higher demand for specialty tires.  Sales gained to 5.44 billion euros ($7.11 billion) from
5.14 billion euros a year earlier, the Clermont-Ferrand, France-
based company said today in a statement. The figure beat the
5.31 billion-euro average of seven analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  The 123-year-old company, which makes more than half of its
revenues selling passenger car and light truck tires, is seeking
to expand in the more profitable segment of tires for planes and
mining equipment.  Michelin also intends to increase sales outside  Europe  and
 North America . The company plans to invest 1.6 billion euros to
2.2 billion euros a year through 2015 to fuel the expansion.
About 60 percent of the spending will target new markets.  Michelin stuck to its 2012 forecast for a “clear”
increase in operating income before non-recurring items. The
company said full-year sales volume will decrease 5 percent. The
French manufacturer has said that it expects 2013 to be a “year
of transition” for tire markets. For 2015, the company targets
operating profit of about 2.9 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
