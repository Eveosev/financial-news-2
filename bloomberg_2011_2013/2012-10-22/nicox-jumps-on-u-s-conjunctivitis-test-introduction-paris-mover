Nicox SA (COX)  jumped the most in two
months after the pharmaceuticals company introduced its
AdenoPlus test for acute conjunctivitis in the U.S.  The  shares jumped  as much as 8.9 percent, the most since
Aug. 28, and were 5.1 percent higher at 2.61 euros as of 2:22
p.m. in Paris. The stock was the biggest gainer on the SBF120
index.  The company said today in a statement that AdenoPlus is its
first product introduction since it announced plans to make
forays into the opthalmic business.  “This achievement represents the first milestone in
Nicox’s new strategy to become a commercial company focused on
opthalmology,” Mathieu Chabert, an analyst with Bryan Garnier &
Co. wrote in a report today. The analyst rates the stock a
“buy,” and has a target price of 3 euros a share based on a
“fair value from a sum of the parts.”  With the product, Nicox is “in a strong position to grow
rapidly as a specialist opthalmic business,” Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Michele Garufi said in the statement.  Nicox’s 30-day  historical volatility , a measure of stock
swings, advanced to 31.9 at 2:23 p.m. from 29.2 the previous
trading day. The SBF120 index’s 30-day volatility measure was at
19.2. A higher reading means the price of an asset can move
dramatically in a short period.  About 2.6 million shares of  Nicox traded , more than triple
the average in the past three months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
