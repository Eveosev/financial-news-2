Oil fell to the lowest level in two
weeks as  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  planned to restart the Keystone
pipeline and on concern that world economic growth is slowing.  Prices dropped 1.5 percent as TransCanada said the pipeline
will resume sending oil to the U.S. today after a two-day delay.
Oil also slipped as Japan’s  exports  slid 10 percent in September
and U.S. stocks tumbled to a five-week low after  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT)   forecast  slower sales growth.  “The main reason why we are seeing a selloff in crude oil
is Keystone,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund
manager at Tyche Capital Advisors. “It will continue to keep
the U.S. well-supplied and push prices down. Economic growth is
slowing and that hurts demand.”  Crude for November delivery fell $1.32 to $88.73 a barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest settlement since
Oct. 3. The contract expires today. December futures slid $1.79,
or 2 percent, to $88.65. Front-month futures are down 10 percent
this year.  Brent for December settlement declined 70 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $109.44 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. Brent’s premium over New York futures widened for the
first time in five days to $20.79.  Brent may decline as the Buzzard field in the North Sea
resumes production,  Hussein Allidina , Morgan Stanley’s head of
commodities research, said in a note dated today.  Midwest Imports  The 590,000-barrel-a-day Keystone pipeline will resume
today, James Millar, a company spokesman in Calgary, said in an
e-mail. The company shut down Keystone on Oct. 17 after routine
testing revealed an “anomaly” on the outside of the line. The
Calgary-based company initially planned a resumption of
operations on Oct. 20. Keystone moves oil from Canada to
Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for New York futures.  The U.S.  imported  1.65 million barrels of oil a day into
the Midwest, or Padd 2 region, in the week ended Oct. 12,
according to the Energy Department. Most of the crude imported
into the region comes from  Canada , the largest U.S. source of
foreign oil.  “It looks like Keystone will start shipping oil to the
U.S. again and it’s bearish for the market,” said Phil Flynn,
senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Crude stockpiles  grew 2.86 million barrels in the week
ended Oct. 12 to 369.2 million, the Energy Department said last
week, the most for the second week in October since government
records began in 1982. Inventories at Cushing dropped 140,000
barrels to 44 million.  Economic Growth  The decrease in Japan’s exports was bigger than the 9.9
percent forecast by analysts polled by Bloomberg. Shipments to
 China , the nation’s largest export market, slid 14 percent from
a year earlier. Exports to the European Union fell 21 percent,
while those to the U.S. rose 0.9 percent.  “ Japan ’s export number is disappointing,” Flynn said.  Oil extended the three-day decline to 4.3 percent as
Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction and
mining equipment, forecast 2013 growth that is the slowest in
four years. Crude fell the most in two weeks on Oct. 19 after
companies including Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co.
reported quarterly revenue that missed forecasts.  “Economic growth is the biggest concern now,” said Bill Baruch, senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in Chicago.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped as much as 0.8
percent to 1,422.06, the lowest level since Sept. 6. The S&P’s
GSCI Index of 24 commodities fell as much as 1.2 percent.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long position in crude futures in the week ended Oct.
16, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Managed money bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 166,278
futures, the Washington-based regulator said in its weekly
Commitments of Traders report. Net long positions rose by 5,274
contracts, or 3.3 percent, from a week earlier.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 418,937
contracts as of 3:07 p.m. Volume totaled 627,850 contracts on
Oct. 19, 19 percent above the three-month average. Open interest
was 1.58 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
