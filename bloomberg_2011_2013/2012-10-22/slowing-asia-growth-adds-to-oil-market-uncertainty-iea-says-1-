Slowing economic growth in  Asia  is
adding to uncertainty in the oil market, according to the
executive director of the  International Energy Agency .  The world is becoming increasingly dependent on Asia to
supply oil products, the IEAâ€™s Maria van der Hoeven said at a
conference in Singapore today.  The IEA has lowered its forecast for global demand growth
for 2012 by 500,000 barrels a day, partly because of signs of
slowing in China, the Paris-based agency said in its Medium Term
Oil Market Report.  Global consumption will increase 1.2 percent a year to 95.7
million barrels a day in 2017, up from 89 million last year, the
IEA forecasts. Asian countries outside the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development, led by China, will account
for more than half of 7 million barrels a day of new global
refining growth by 2015, the Oct. 12 report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
