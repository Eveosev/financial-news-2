Somalia piracy attacks against
merchant shipping fell to the lowest in six years in the third
quarter as armed guards on vessels and naval patrols cut
attempted hijacks on the trade route linking  Asia  and  Europe .  One ship was attacked compared with 36 in the same quarter
a year ago, the London-based International Maritime Bureau,
which has been tracking incidents since 1991, said in an e-
mailed report today. That’s the fewest since the same period in
2006, when no attacks were reported, Assistant Director Cyrus Mody said by e-mail.  Governments spent almost $1.3 billion last year on military
interventions including naval patrols, the One Earth Future
Foundation, a Broomfield, Colorado-based non-profit, said in
February. Attacks cost the industry and governments $6.9 billion
last year, it estimated. Fourteen out of 28 ships briefed by the
U.K.’s Royal Navy in the week to Oct. 19 were carrying or
recently carried armed guards, U.K. Maritime Trade Operations
said in an e-mailed report Oct. 20.  “We welcome the successful robust targeting of pirate
action groups by international navies in the high-risk waters
off  Somalia ,” IMB Director Pottengal Mukundan said in the
report. “There can be no room for complacency. These waters are
still extremely high-risk and the naval presence must be
maintained.”  Trade worth $952 billion transited the  Gulf of Aden  and
Indian Ocean in 2009, according to a 2011 report for the U.K.’s
Chamber of Shipping and the London-based Oil Companies
International Marine Forum.  Suez Canal  About 48,000 vessels a year sail through the Indian Ocean,
and 23,000 transit the Gulf of Aden, the European Union Naval
Force Somalia said in June 2011 evidence to a U.K. parliamentary
inquiry. Ships using  Egypt ’s Suez Canal pass Somalia when
sailing to Europe from Asia and the  Middle East .  Somali attacks in the first nine months declined to 70 from
199 a year ago, the report said.  While attacks off Somalia slumped, incidents off West
Africa climbed to 34 in the first nine months of 2012 from 30 a
year earlier. The number of attacks off  Indonesia  advanced to 51
from 46 for all of 2011, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
