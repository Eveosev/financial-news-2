The U.S. dollar may extend gains
against its Canadian counterpart should it breach its 200-day
moving average, according to Royal Bank of  Canada .  The greenback began a “corrective phase” in September,
 George Davis , RBC’s Toronto-based chief technical analyst for
fixed income and currency strategy, wrote in a note to clients
yesterday. The U.S. currency climbed from a low of 96.33
Canadian cents on Sept. 14 to as high as 99.65 cents yesterday,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 200-day moving
average stands at 99.99, according to RBC.  “A daily close above this level is required to trigger a
bullish trend reversal that would indicate that an important
shift in sentiment is underway,” Davis wrote, referring to the
U.S. dollar’s 200-day average.  The greenback bought 99.24 Canadian cents as of 8:21 a.m.
in  Tokyo  from 99.22 yesterday, when it reached 99.65, the
strongest since Aug. 10. The Canadian dollar is nicknamed the
loonie for the image of an aquatic bird on the C$1 coin.  The  U.S. dollar ’s moving average convergence/divergence was
at 0.0019, while its signal line was at 0.0002, Bloomberg data
show. That’s the widest gap since Oct. 3, indicating the U.S.
currency may advance.  MACD is a gauge of momentum and is calculated by
subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12
day average. The signal line is a nine-day exponential moving
average of the MACD, and provides buy and sell signals.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
