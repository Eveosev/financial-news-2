The ruble fell the most in two weeks
on bets banks are selling the local currency and buying dollars
to fund OAO Rosneft’s purchase of TNK-BP, the country’s third-
largest oil company.  The ruble sank 0.7 percent, the biggest drop since Oct. 8,
against the dollar at 31.0585 by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the
worst performing among emerging-markets currencies tracked by
Bloomberg. The ruble fell 0.9 percent versus the euro to
40.5900. It was down 0.8 percent against the central bank’s
euro-dollar target basket.  Rosneft agreed to buy BP’s half of the TNK-BP oil venture
for $26.8 billion in cash and shares, according to a statement
today.  Russia ’s largest oil company also agreed to acquire the
other half of TNK-BP from its billionaire shareholders for $28
billion in cash.  “It is about the Rosneft and TNK-BP deal,” Igor Akinshin,
a currency trader at Moscow-based OAO Alfa Bank, said by phone.
“The thought is that a lot of dollars will be bought for this
deal and that is what’s playing in the market.”  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.5375 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.3320 on Oct. 19.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell five basis points 169, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index of five-
year government bond yields added two basis points to 6.9969
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
