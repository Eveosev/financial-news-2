“Welcome nudes, ladies and dudes,”
a deep male voice announced through loudspeakers.  Women in hot pants marched on stilts around the 10th floor
of Sotheby’s headquarters in  Manhattan .  It was the 21st annual “Take Home a Nude” fundraiser for
the New York Academy of Art, a graduate program teaching
classical skills. Almost 150 works, many featuring minimal
wardrobe, were sold by silent auction.  The event attracted actors Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts and
Brooke Shields, chef Daniel Boulud, Miami-based collector Martin Margulies and head of Astenbeck Capital Management Andrew J. Hall. It raised about $800,000. Click  here  to see the slide
