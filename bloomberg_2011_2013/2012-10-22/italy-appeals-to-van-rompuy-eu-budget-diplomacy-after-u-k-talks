Italian European Affairs Minister
Enzo Moavero Milanesi appealed to European Union President
 Herman Van Rompuy  to resolve differences among states in time
for a deal on the EU budget next month.  “There’s a month of time to find common ground,” Moavero
said at a press conference in  Rome  with U.K. Europe Minister
David Lidington. “There will be bilateral meetings of national
delegations with EU President Herman Van Rompuy to bridge
differences to allow the heads of state and government at the
extraordinary summit in November to possibly close the budget.”  Leaders from the EU’s 27 member states will meet in
Brussels next month to seek agreement on the seven-year budget.
Milanesi, who serves under Prime Minister  Mario Monti , said the
summit would be constructive and that  Italy  shared Lidington’s
approach to the negotiations.  “We want to reach an agreement in November, but it has to
be the right kind of agreement,” Lidington told reporters at
the conference. “This is an agreement that will require
unanimous consent.”  The U.K. is “engaged in intensive discussions with our
partners, including Italy, about the way forward,” Lidington
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
