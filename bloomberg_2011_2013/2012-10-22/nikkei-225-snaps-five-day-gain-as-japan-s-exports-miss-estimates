Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY) 
climbed for a sixth day after the yen weakened amid speculation
the Bank of Japan will add stimulus at a meeting next week. The
gauge fell earlier as companies including Mitsubishi Corp. cut
profit forecasts.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets about 80 percent of
its sales abroad, reversed early losses to finish the day up 1.1
percent. Jupiter Telecommunications Co. surged 18 percent on a
report it will buy Japan Cablenet Ltd. to control half of the
country’s cable television market. Mitsubishi dropped 1.8
percent, pacing declines among commodity traders.  “The yen is weakening further and there’s a strong
expectation the BOJ will ease monetary policy,” said  Akio
Yoshino , who helps oversee the equivalent of $31 billion as
chief economist at Amundi Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. “Expectations
the BOJ may add to purchases of  Exchange Traded Funds  are
growing.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained 0.1 percent to close at
9,010.71 in Tokyo. The benchmark reversed a decline of 1.5
percent after the yen weakened as investors interpreted a report
showing declining Japanese exports as a sign the central bank
would be under added pressure to ease policy. The broader Topix
Index, which includes smaller companies less affected by
currency fluctuations, lost 0.1 percent to 753.72.  Winning Streak  The Nikkei 225 jumped 5.5 percent last week, its biggest
such rise since December, as reports on U.S. retail sales,
housing starts and manufacturing beat estimates and  China ’s
economy showed signs of stabilization. Shares on the gauge trade
at 1.1 times book value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  Exporters rebounded today after the yen depreciated to as
low as 104.02 against the euro, compared with 103.76 at the
close of stock trading on Oct. 19. Against the dollar, Japan’s
currency fell to 79.63 from 79.35. A weaker yen boosts the value
of overseas income for Japanese companies.  Honda gained 1.1 percent to 2,613 yen. Nintendo Co., a game
console maker that gets more than 70 percent of its revenue from
the Americas and Europe, climbed 1 percent to 10,450 yen.  Japan ’s exports slid 10.3 percent last month, the most
since May 2011, as shipments to China dropped amid a territorial
dispute over islands in the East China Sea, a Finance Ministry
report showed.  The data came after Economy Minister Seiji Maehara put
pressure on the Bank of Japan yesterday, saying the nation is
“falling behind” other countries in monetary stimulus and
faces the threat of a credit-rating downgrade.  Jupiter Climbs  Jupiter Telecom surged by its daily limit of 15,000 yen, or
18 percent, to 97,700 yen after the Nikkei newspaper reported
the company, controlled by KDDI Corp. and Sumitomo Corp., will
acquire Japan Cablenet, a unit of KDDI, by March 2013.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.3
percent today. The gauge fell 1.7 percent on Oct. 19 after
Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co. reported earnings that
missed estimates.  Japan’s current earnings season peaks next week, with 568
of the 1,672 Topix companies reporting results. Nintendo Co. and
steelmaker JFE Holdings Inc. are among 126 companies scheduled
to post this week.  Among shares that dropped today,  Mitsubishi (8058)  Corp. fell 1.8
percent to 1,404 yen after cutting its annual profit forecast by
34 percent and reducing its planned dividend. The trading house
said Europe’s debt crisis and slower growth in China is pushing
commodity prices below its anticipated range.  Amada Co. (6113)  sank 1.7 percent to 409 yen after the maker of
factory tools slashed its net income forecast by 58 percent for
the year ending March 31, citing growth in China and other
emerging countries.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 5.7 percent
to 19.02, indicating that traders expect a swing of 5.5 percent
on the equity benchmark in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
