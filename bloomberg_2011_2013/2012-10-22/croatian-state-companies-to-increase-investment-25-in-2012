Croatia’s state companies expect to
increase investment 25 percent in 2012 from a year earlier,
focusing on infrastructure and energy projects, Economy Minister
Radimir Cacic told reporters in Zagreb today.  Eight state companies have invested 710 million euros ($926
million) in the first nine months, mostly in highways and gas
pipelines as well as into a container terminal on the island of
Krk and thermoelectric plant Sisak, he said.  INA Industrija Nafte d.d. , the oil refiner controlled by
Hungary’s  Mol Nyrt. (MOL) , still has to make public its investment
results for the year, Cacic said. Croatia owns 44.84 percent in
the Zagreb-based company, while Mol holds a 49.1 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
