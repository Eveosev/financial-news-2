Iron-ore  swaps rose to the highest
since July on speculation  China  may cut the amount of cash banks
have to keep in reserve, helping purchases of the commodity used
to make steel, according to SSY Futures Ltd.  November contracts rose 2.6 percent to $116.50, the highest
since July 31, Jamie Pearce, head of iron ore and freight at SSY
in  Singapore , said in an e-mail today. Trading of the
derivatives will more than triple this year as investors use
them to bet on Chinese economic growth and steel demand, broker
Freight Investor Services Ltd. estimates.  Swaps rose on speculation China’s central bank may lower
the reserve-requirement ratio for lenders, Pearce said. Domestic
steel prices also rose, he said. Steel reinforcement-bar futures
climbed to the highest close in almost 12 weeks.  Growth in the world’s second-largest economy slowed for a
seventh quarter, expanding 7.4 percent in the three months to
September from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics
said Oct. 18, matching the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. China’s central bank cut  interest rates  in June and July
for the first time since 2008 and has reduced banks’ reserve
requirements three times since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
