Sundance Resources Ltd. (SDL)  rose to the
highest in almost two months in Sydney trading after Sichuan
Hanlong Group gained key support for its A$1.14 billion ($1.18
billion) bid for the rest of the Australian iron ore developer.  Sundance added 2.9 percent to 35 Australian cents at the
close, the highest since Aug. 28. That’s still 22 percent less
than Hanlong’s offer of 45 cents a share. It had risen as much
as 12 percent, as the S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.7 percent.  Hanlong obtained in principle agreement from China
Development Bank to provide a debt facility of as much as $1.02
billion for the takeover bid, as well as approval from Bank of
Deyang Co. for loans to finance the balance, Perth-based
Sundance said today in a statement. The parties aim to close the
deal by Jan. 8, Sundance said.  Hanlong, a Chinese investor in highway and power projects,
won support from Sundance’s board in August for its reduced bid
of 45 cents a share for the rest of the company. Hanlong already
owns about 17 percent of Sundance, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Buying Sundance will give Hanlong control of the $4.7
billion Mbalam rail, port and mine project at the borders of
Cameroon and the Republic of Congo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
