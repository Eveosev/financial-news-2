China will fund construction of a
hospital on the island of  Dominica , the Jamaica Gleaner reported,
citing Julius Timothy, the countryâ€™s health minister.  Dominica has received about $1 million a year from China
after the Caribbean nation severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in
2004, the Kingston-based newspaper  said  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
