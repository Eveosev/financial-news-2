A two-day water leadership forum on
the challenges that industries face in a more water-stressed
world opens tomorrow in  San Diego , attracting policy-makers and
executives from the energy, fracking and power sector.  Bloomberg New Energy Finance is hosting its first water
forum as part of an examination the London-based research group
is making of the global challenges that businesses face at a
time when water plays a larger role in resources planning.  Studies show that from 2015 to 2025 the average country
expenditure on water infrastructure will increase by almost 30
percent when “all of the  Middle East  and North Africa, sub-
Saharan Africa and  South Asia  will be severely stressed for
freshwater resources,” BNEF said.  China and the U.S., both suffering from drought this year
that pushed food prices higher, “will face high stress levels”
during that period, said BNEF, a unit of Bloomberg LP. Average
per capita consumption of water in the U.S. is four times that
of  China  or  India , the most populous nations, it said.  The meetings open tomorrow by discussing the need for more
integrated planning amid regional water scarcity issues by the
municipal, power and agriculture sector and a look at managing
water risks by companies to minimize exposure to water scarcity.  The forum closes on Oct. 24 with sessions on water and
power, “war games” and looking at water and its role “front
and center in the shale industry.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
