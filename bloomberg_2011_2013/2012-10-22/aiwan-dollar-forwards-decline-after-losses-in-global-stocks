one-week low as a retreat in global stocks boosted demand for
the safety of the greenback.  The contracts fell as much as 0.2 percent as the Taiex
index of shares declined a second day after the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index dropped by the most in four months on Oct. 19.

growth uncertainty.”  One-month non-deliverable forwards traded at NT$29.205 as

exchange data show.  Intervention  The Taiwan dollar may weaken to NT$30 by year-end, Ji
predicted. “The economy itself is cyclical” and authorities
“are trying to weaken the currency a little bit,” he said.  Taiwan’s central bank has intervened to stem advances in
the currency in late trading on most days in the past five
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified.  The yield on the 2 percent government bonds due July 2017
