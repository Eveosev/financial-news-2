Tiger Woods’s golf-course design business, which has yet to complete a full 18-hole project, disclosed plans to build a second course in  Mexico .  Woods’s current course projects in Dubai,  North Carolina  and Ensanada, Mexico, remain under construction after financing and building plans were affected by the recession.  Woods’s first Mexican project, Punta Brava, an oceanfront design about 65 miles south of San Diego,  California , was originally scheduled for completion in 2011, according to Flagship Group, the firm that is developing the course.  His new design, called “El Cardonal,” will be in  Cabo San Lucas  as part of Diamante Cabo San Lucas, a 1,500-acre oceanfront resort community. Construction began last month and is expected to be completed by  April (APR)  2013, Woods and Diamante officials said in a press release. The resort currently features an 18-hole Davis Love III-designed links course, Diamante Dunes, which opened in 2009.  Woods’s Diamante course will measure about 7,300 yards and include rolling contours and wide fairways for all skill levels, according to the 14-time major tournament winner who started his design firm in December 2006.  None of Woods’s courses have opened. The Cliffs at High Carolina, between Asheville, North Carolina, and Greenville,  South Carolina , in the Blue Ridge Mountains, is on hold as the residential community’s new owners study the course’s viability.  Dubai Properties Group, a unit of Dubai Holding Commercial Operations Group LLC, suspended construction on Woods’s course last year, citing an unfavorable luxury property market.  The opening of Punta Brava was pushed back until late 2013, according to a May press release.  Neither  Mark Steinberg , Woods’s agent, nor Glenn Greenspan, a spokesman for Woods’s ETW Corp., immediately responded to an e-mail seeking comment on the design projects.
