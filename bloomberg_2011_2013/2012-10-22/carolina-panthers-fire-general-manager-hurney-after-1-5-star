The Carolina Panthers, who are 1-5
and haven’t had back-to-back winning seasons since joining the
National Football League in 1995, fired General Manager Marty
Hurney.  The Panthers haven’t won since they defeated the New
Orleans Saints on Sept. 16. They were 6-10 last year.  Hurney was the general manager since 2002, and his teams
competed in the 2003 Super Bowl and the 2005 National Football
Conference championship game. The Panthers also won the NFC
South in 2008.  “This was an extremely difficult decision,” owner Jerry
Richardson said in an e-mailed statement. “Marty made every
effort to bring success to the Panthers and took the team to a
Super Bowl and two NFC championship games.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
