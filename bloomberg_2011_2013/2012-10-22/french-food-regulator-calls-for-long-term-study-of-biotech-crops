France’s food-security authority
Anses called for long-term research on the effect of
genetically-modified crops, citing a limited number of studies
on the subject.  The agency said a French toxicity study of  Monsanto Co. (MON) ’s
NK 603 corn, a variety tolerant to the pesticide Roundup, didn’t
put into question the crop’s regulatory approval. Anses found
only two other feeding studies of biotech crops associated with
pesticides that tracked animals over their entire lifespan, it
wrote in an  online  statement today.  “Anses recommends starting studies and research on the
long-term effect of GMOs associated with phytopharmaceutical
preparations,” the agency wrote. “This work should be done in
the framework of public financing and on the basis of precise
research protocols.”  The French government remains committed to a moratorium in
the country on genetically-modified crops approved for growing
in the European Union, the Agriculture, Environment and Health
Ministries wrote today in a  reaction  to the Anses statement.  France  is seeking an overhaul of the EU framework for
evaluation, authorization and control of genetically modified
organisms and pesticides, according to the government statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
