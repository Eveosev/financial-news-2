The euro region’s combined debt
burden surged last year to the highest since the start of the
single currency as governments struggled to fill budget gaps and
contain the fiscal crisis.  The debt of the 17 nations using the euro climbed to 87.3
percent of gross domestic product in 2011 from 85.4 percent the
previous year, the European Union’s statistics office in
Luxembourg said today. That’s the highest since the euro was
introduced in 1999.  Greece  topped the list with debt at 170.6
percent of GDP, followed by Italy and  Portugal  at 120.7 percent
and 108.1 percent. The EU’s debt-to-GDP limit is 60 percent.  European governments are seeking ways to plug their
deficits and restore investor confidence as the economy shows
signs of a deepening economic slump. Greek Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras’s government has been negotiating with the euro
area and the  International Monetary Fund  over 13.5 billion euros
($17.6 billion) of austerity measures for 2013 and 2014 needed
to qualify for the release of more loan installments.  Peripheral nations’ austerity push “may drive these
countries into a deep recession and it may cause structural
damage,” Richard Barwell, an economist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, said in a research note. “But it will bring
forward the point at which the debtor is fundamentally sound --
running a sizeable structural surplus, reaping the returns of
reforms that should boost growth.”  The euro strengthened 0.3 percent against the dollar today
and was at $1.3068 as of 11:45 a.m. in  London .  Austerity Measures  Fourteen of the 27 EU member states exceeded the bloc’s
debt limit last year, according to today’s report.  Germany ’s
debt burden was at 80.5 percent of GDP, down from 82.5 percent
in 2010. In Greece, Ireland and Portugal, which all have
received government bailouts, debt increased from the previous
year. Spain’s debt rose to 69.3 percent from 61.5 percent.  The euro area’s total budget deficit narrowed to 4.1
percent of GDP last year from 6.2 percent in 2010 as nations
toughened austerity measures to contain the sovereign-debt
crisis. Seventeen EU member states had deficits exceeding the
limit of 3 percent of GDP, with Ireland’s budget gap at 13.4
percent, followed by Greece and Spain at 9.4 percent of GDP.  The statistics office previously reported that euro-zone
government debt had reached 87.2 percent of GDP in 2011.  Japan Exports  Elsewhere today,  Japan ’s exports fell the most since the
aftermath of last year’s earthquake as a global slowdown, the
yen’s strength and a dispute with  China  increase the odds of a
contraction in the world’s third-largest economy.  Shipments slid 10.3 percent in September from a year
earlier, leaving a trade deficit of 558.6 billion yen ($7
billion), the  Finance Ministry  said. The median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts was for a 9.9 percent decline.
Imports rose 4.1 percent.  Shipments to China, the nation’s largest export market,
slid 14.1 percent from a year earlier. Exports to the EU fell
21.1 percent, while those to the U.S. rose 0.9 percent. Auto
shipments to all markets dropped 14.6 percent.  In a speech in  Tokyo  today, BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa
vowed to conduct “seamless” monetary easing as the Japanese
economy is “leveling off.”  Taiwan’s unemployment rate increased to 4.3 percent in
September, the statistics bureau said in Taipei today. In
 Australia , the government announced spending cuts to help
deliver a  budget surplus . Elsewhere in the Asia Pacific region,
 Hong Kong  reported higher-than-estimated inflation of 3.8
percent for September.  No major economic data is due to be published in the U.S.
today. The  Federal Reserve  will tomorrow begin its last policy-
setting meeting before the presidential election. It plans to
release a statement after the two-day meeting on Oct. 24.  To contact the reporters on this story:
