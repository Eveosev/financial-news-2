Square Inc., a startup that plans to
double its workforce by the end of next year, is moving its
headquarters to  San Francisco ’s Central Market neighborhood,
joining an expanding group of technology companies in the area.  Square intends to occupy 150,000 square feet (13,900 square
meters) at 1455 Market St. by mid-2013, said Jude Komuves, vice
president of people. The company, which makes credit-card
readers for smartphones and tablets, plans to increase
employment to more than 1,000 workers from 400, she said. The
building is owned by Hudson Pacific Properties Inc.  Square announced plans to start processing payments
internationally this year and struck a deal with  Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) 
that puts the company’s technology in 7,000 of the coffee
maker’s U.S. stores. That expansion will require more space for
staff, Komuves said. Square competes in a market for mobile
payments for physical goods that may grow to $170 billion by
2015 from about $60 billion last year, according to Juniper
Research Ltd.  “We’re only taking a couple of floors to start, but we
have the option to expand into significant portions of the
building,” Komuves said in an interview. “We’ll have a chef’s
kitchen that will be ours to design and develop, and there will
be really open collaborative work environments with lots of
different types of seating.”  More Space  Square’s lease is for about 250,000 square feet, with the
additional space ready in the second half of 2013, said J.D.
Lumpkin, Cushman & Wakefield Inc.’s co-listing broker for the
property. It includes the option for another 81,350 square feet,
Hudson Pacific said in a separate statement.  The Central Market neighborhood has attracted companies
including Twitter Inc., which relocated to 1355 Market St.
earlier this year.  Dolby Laboratories Inc. (DLB) , the audio-technology
company whose products are used in cinemas, recording studios
and video games, agreed in June to buy a 16-story tower in the
area to make the building its new headquarters.  Occupancy in San Francisco’s Central Market area rose by
188,601 square feet in the year through Sept. 30, most of that
from Twitter’s 164,051-square-foot expansion at 1355 Market St.,
according to data from brokerage Cassidy Turley.  City Occupancy  San Francisco’s office market added 1.43 million square
feet in occupancy in the first nine months of 2012, Cassidy
Turley said. The vacancy rate rose to 9.7 percent in September
from 9.4 percent in June as financial firms consolidated space.
Asking rents in the Central Market submarket averaged $42.30 a
square foot in the third quarter, according to the company.  Square’s new building has 1 million square feet of  office
space  and was used as a  data center  and administrative offices
by its former owner, Bank of America Corp., before it was
acquired for $93 million in December 2010 by Los Angeles-based
Hudson Pacific, Lumpkin said.  Square’s new hires will be mostly engineers and designers
as it vies with mobile credit-card readers from  EBay Inc.’s (EBAY) 
PayPal,  Intuit Inc. (INTU)  and  VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  Closely held
Square, created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, is processing
more than $8 billion in transactions on an annualized basis.  To contact the reporters on this story:
