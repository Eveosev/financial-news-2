OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)  dropped to the
lowest level in two months on concern minority shareholders in
the traded unit of  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Russian venture won’t benefit from
OAO Rosneft’s deal to acquire the company.  TNK-BP fell 1.6 percent to 78.50 rubles by the close in
Moscow, the lowest level since Aug. 20. About 4 million shares
changed hands, or about eight times the three-month daily
average. Rosneft rose 2.6 percent to 219.75 rubles in Moscow and
climbed 2 percent to $7.06 in  London .  BP will sell its 50 percent stake in  Russia ’s third-largest
oil producer for $17.1 billion in cash and 12.8 percent of
Rosneft’s shares, according to a statement today. BP will
reinvest $4.8 billion in the government’s shares of Rosneft,
leaving it with $12.3 billion in cash, 19.75 percent of the
state-backed company and two board seats. Rosneft also has an
agreement to buy the other half of TNK-BP from a group of
billionaires for $28 billion in cash, Rosneft said in a separate
statement.  “It’s unclear what role TNK-BP will play in Rosneft’s
business, whether it will be dissolved, whether the minorities
will receive a payout,”  Alexei Kokin , an analyst at UralSib
Capital, said by phone from Moscow. “Nobody expected that
Rosneft would agree to buy out the entire company in one day,
that doesn’t leave time for dividend discussions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
