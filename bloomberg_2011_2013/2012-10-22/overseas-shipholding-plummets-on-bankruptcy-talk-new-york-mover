Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. (OSG) ’s
bonds and stocks plunged after the largest U.S. tanker company
said in a regulatory filing it’s considering filing for  Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection .  Overseas Shipholding is “in the process of reviewing a tax
issue” and financial statements since at least 2008 “should no
longer be relied upon,” according to a  filing  from the New
York-based company today. The shipping corporation will probably
fall out of compliance with covenants in its credit agreements,
including a loan-to-value requirement, CreditSights Inc.
analysts  Roger King  and Brian Foster wrote in an Oct. 17 note.  Its $300 million of 8.125 percent notes due March 2018
plummeted 16.25 cents to 35.5 cents on the dollar as of 10:10
a.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The bonds
traded as high as 79.48 cents in April, the data show.  The shares slumped 62 percent to $1.23 as of 12:19 p.m.
local time, valuing the company at $38 million.  Overseas Shipholding board director G. Allen Andreas III
resigned on Sept. 27 from the company as a result of a
disagreement “as to the process the board is taking in
reviewing a tax issue,” according to an Oct. 3 filing from the
company.  The company is “evaluating its strategic options,
including the potential voluntary filing of a petition for
relief to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the  bankruptcy code ,”
according to today’s filing.  Carrier Rates  Rates for very large crude carriers, each hauling 2 million
barrels of oil, plunged 55 percent to $14,320 a day this year,
according to Clarkson Plc, the world’s largest shipbroker.  Overseas Shipholding has a fleet of 111 ships, including 13
very large crude carriers. It may have a cash-flow shortfall of
$170 million over the next 12 months and faces the February
maturity of its $1.5 billion credit facility, Evercore Partners
Inc. analyst Jonathan Chappell wrote in a note.  A slump in tanker rates has reduced the values of the
vessels and led to last year’s reorganizations of Frontline Ltd
and General Maritime Corp.  Frontline, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based owner led by Norway-
born billionare  John Fredriksen , said it would split in two to
avoid a rout in rates. General Maritime, which operates in more
than 230 ports in more than 70 countries, filed for bankruptcy
in November.  Torm A/S, a Danish owner which specializes in hauling
gasoline, said Oct. 2 it handed over a 73 percent stake to banks
in return for a new debt deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
