The Serbian dinar will probably
decline 12 percent over the next year because of the size of the
deficit and high public debt, brokerage Exotix Ltd. said.  The broker initiated a sell recommendation across local
currency instruments to reflect partly a “technical argument
about monetary and fiscal policy co-ordination,” London-based
Exotix economist Gabriel Sterne wrote in a note today, adding he
forecasts the currency at 127.6 by mid-October 2013.  It traded 0.4 percent higher at 113.8087 to the euro at
3:42 p.m. in Belgrade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The dinar rose to a five-month high on Oct. 12 as banks
increased credit activity backed by government subsidies amid
rising investor appetite for the currency.  “In such an environment we think current  interest rates  on
local currency instruments, albeit high, do not compensate for
exchange rate risk,” Sterne said, adding that the central bank
“may have been too slow” to respond with “forex
intervention” to offset appreciation pressures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
