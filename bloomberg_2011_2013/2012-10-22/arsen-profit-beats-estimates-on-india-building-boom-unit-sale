Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , India’s
biggest builder of power networks and airports, posted a better-
than-expected 43 percent increase in second-quarter profit,
helped by higher sales and the sale of a stake in a unit.  Net income  rose to 11.4 billion rupees ($213 million) in
the three months ended Sept. 30, from 7.98 billion rupees a year
earlier, the Mumbai-based company said in a statement today.
That exceeded the 8.8 billion-rupee median of 27 analyst
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose 17 percent to 132.3 billion rupees, as India’s
push to attract $1 trillion of infrastructure spending by 2017
stoked construction of factories, roads and railways. The
builder also posted a 2.14 billion rupees gain from selling its
plastic machinery business, Chief Financial Officer R. Shankar Raman said at a press conference.  Larsen, the best performer on the BSE  India  Sensitive Index
this year,  rose  2.3 percent to 1,671 rupees at close of Mumbai
trading. The stock has jumped 68 percent this year while the
Sensex gained 22 percent.  The company won 209.7 billion rupees of orders in the
quarter, 30 percent more than a year earlier. Its total order
book stood at 1.59 trillion rupees as of Sept. 30.  Larsen is on course to meet its target of a 15 percent to
20 percent growth in orders for the fiscal year, Raman said. The
company has hired 5,000 people in the past year to executive the
projects, he said.  “The rebounding of industrial production and improved
credit demand was seen in many sectors towards the end of the
quarter,” Larsen said in the statement. “A few steps taken by
the government recently underscore its commitment for
accelerating the pace of economic development.”  India’s economy expanded 5.5 percent in the quarter ended
in June, faster than the three-year low of 5.3 percent in the
previous quarter. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s government
last month eased ownership rules for retailers and airlines as
part of efforts to lure investments and boost growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
