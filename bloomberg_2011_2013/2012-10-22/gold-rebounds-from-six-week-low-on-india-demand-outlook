Gold futures rebounded from a six-
week low in  New York  as physical demand may increase in  India ,
the world’s biggest buyer.  India’s imports are set to climb for the first time in six
quarters as a decline in domestic prices stokes jewelry and
investment purchases before major festivals, according to
Bachhraj Bamalwa, the chairman of the All India Gems & Jewellery
Trade Federation. Prices also gained as a report showed  Japan ’s
exports fell the most since the aftermath of last year’s
earthquake, increasing speculation that the nation will enact
more stimulus measures.  “Physical demand is providing some support,” Phil Streible, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates, said in a telephone interview. “The pressure is
clearly on the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to introduce fresh easing
measures.”  Gold futures for December delivery rose 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,726.30 an ounce at 1:35 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, after reaching $1,714.40, the lowest since Sept. 7.  Prices gained 11 percent in the third quarter after central
banks in the U.S., China, Japan and Europe took action to boost
their economies. Japanese Economy Minister Seiji Maehara
yesterday said the country needs more monetary easing and policy
efforts to encourage growth.  Silver futures for December delivery advanced 0.5 percent
to $32.252 an ounce in New York. Earlier, the price touched
$31.71, the lowest since Sept. 4.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,612.20 an ounce, the
third straight decline. Palladium futures for December delivery
slipped 0.1 percent to $622.65 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
