Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  is
considering scrapping annual bonuses for senior bankers in favor
of 10-year incentive awards linked to the firm’s share price, a
person with knowledge of the discussions said.  The proposal is one of many being put to  investors  and no
decisions have yet been made on whether the bank will adopt it,
said the person who asked not to be identified because the talks
are private. Any changes would be introduced in 2014 at the
earliest, the person said.  The new long-term awards could be contingent on Lloyds’s
share price rising above the average price of about 63 pence,
including fees, that the U.K. Treasury paid for its 40 percent
stake in the lender, the person said. Lloyds, Britain’s biggest
mortgage lender, rose 1.7 percent to 41.19 pence by 9:58 a.m. in
 London . The stock has gained 59 percent this year, making it the
best performer in the six-member FTSE 350 Banks Index.  “We keep our remuneration plans under review at all times
but have no current plans to change our structures and do not
expect to do so in the foreseeable future,” Lloyds said in a
statement today.  The Financial Times reported the discussions on
compensation earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
