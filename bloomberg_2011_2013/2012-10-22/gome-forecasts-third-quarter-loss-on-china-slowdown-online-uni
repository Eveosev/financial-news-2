Gome Electrical Appliances Holding
Ltd. (493) , China’s second-largest electronics retailer, forecast a
third-quarter loss as consumers cut spending and costs increased
in its e-commerce business.  The company expects a loss of 100 million  yuan  ($16
million) to 200 million yuan for the three months ended
September, according to a statement to Hong Kong stock exchange
today.  Gome and bigger rival  Suning Appliance Co. (002024)  have been hurt
by rising price competition after online retailer 360buy
Jingdong Mall announced plans to cut prices. Chinese consumers
have pulled back and are shopping for bargains as China’s
economic growth has slowed to its  weakest pace  since 2009.  Gome posted a loss of 501 million yuan for the six months
ended June from a 1.25 billion yuan profit a year ago.  There was still “an improvement in profitability” in the
third quarter from the second quarter, according to today’s
statement. Gome expects to announce third-quarter earnings no
later than Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
