Ethanol was little changed in
 Chicago  as corn moved the least in almost two weeks.  The biofuel fell 0.1 percent, declining for the first time
in four days, as corn decreased 0.25 cent. U.S. ethanol, which
is made from corn and blended into gasoline, has ranged from
$2.37 to $2.443 in the past week.  “We’re in kind of a holding pattern, bouncing around a
fairly narrow range,” said  Chris Wilson , an analyst at Atten
Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena, Illinois. “There’s really
not a whole lot of news.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery decreased 0.2 cent
to $2.425 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price has
risen 10 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol rose 1 cent to $2.50 a
gallon in  New York , 1 cent to $2.435 in Chicago, 1 cent to $2.49
on the  Gulf Coast , and 0.5 cent to $2.58 on the West Coast.  Corn for December delivery fell 0.25 cent to $7.6125 a
bushel in Chicago. One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Crude oil for November delivery sank $1.32, or 1.5 percent,
to $88.73 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Gasoline for November delivery declined 4.88 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $2.6475 a gallon on the Nymex. The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol before
delivery to filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
