Lithuania  and  Latvia  should adopt
the euro to bring discipline to the European Union’s common
currency area, Leszek Balcerowicz, the architect of Poland’s
1990s switch to a market economy, told the  Baltic News Service .  The two countries are “a needed example of discipline”
for western European governments that have failed to control
their deficits, the newswire quoted the Polish economist as
saying today in Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius.  Lithuania and Latvia, which peg their currencies to the
euro, “wouldn’t lose anything” by taking the final step of
adoption, while adding their voices to policy debates could
boost the stability of the euro, he said, according to BNS.  Lithuanian Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius’s goal of
joining the euro in 2014 is probably realistic, Balcerowicz
said, BNS reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
