Nielsen Holdings NV (NLSN) , the consumer
research company controlled by private equity investors
including  KKR & Co. (KKR) , fell the most since September of last year
after sales missed analysts’ estimates.  Nielsen, which provides the audience data used to set TV
advertising rates,  dropped  5.7 percent to $29.65 at the close in
New York, the biggest daily decline since Sept. 22, 2011. The
shares are little changed this year.  Third-quarter sales rose 0.7 percent to $1.42 billion, New
York-based Nielsen said today in a statement, reflecting a drop
in the business that analyzes  consumer spending . Analysts had
forecast $1.44 billion, the average of 15  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. For the year, revenue excluding currency changes,
will grow at the low end of the 5 percent to 6 percent range the
company had predicted, Chief Financial Officer Brian J. West
said on a conference call.  “Anytime a company misses revenue but hits earnings,
investors are skeptical on the true organic pace of the
business,” Todd Juenger, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co. in  New York , wrote in a note. “These flames were fanned by
managements’ guiding to the lower end” of its revenue forecast
for 2012 while projecting profit margin in the high end of the
range. Juenger has a “market perform” rating on the stock.  Third-quarter profit excluding some items totaled 53 cents,
beating estimates of 50 cents. Net income rose 2.9 percent to
$105 million, or 29 cents a share.  For the year, Nielsen forecasts  profit  of $1.82 a share to
$1.84 a share, exceeding the $1.81 average of analysts’
estimates. In July the company forecast $1.76 to $1.82.  In addition to KKR, Nielsen is controlled by private equity
investors  Blackstone Group LP (BX) ,  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , Hellman &
Friedman LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP. They control 57
percent of the stock, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
