Mexico ’s peso bond yields rose to a
four-week high as an improving economic outlook locally and
abroad damped demand for assets seen as a refuge.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 increased three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.55 percent at 4
p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It’s the highest closing yield since Sept. 20. The price fell
0.33 centavo to 139.30 centavos per peso today. The currency
appreciated 0.2 percent to 12.8582 per dollar.  Demand for Mexican bonds has been declining along with that
of U.S. Treasuries on a reduced “flight to quality” trade,
said Kenneth Lam, a Latin America currency and rates strategist
at Citigroup Inc.  “The overall dominant theme still here is slightly modest
risk-on sentiment,” Lam said in a telephone interview from New
York. “Mexican rates are trading still very much in line with
U.S. rates.”  The 60-day  correlation coefficient  between 10-year peso
bonds and Treasuries was 0.55 today, up from 0.21 two months
ago, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A reading of 1
would mean the two securities move in lockstep.  Mexican retail sales rose 4.8 percent in August from a year
earlier, the country’s statistics agency said today, beating the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey that projected a 3.4
percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
