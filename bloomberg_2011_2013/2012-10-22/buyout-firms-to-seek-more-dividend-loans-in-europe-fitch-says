Private-equity firms will seek to
refinance more European leveraged buyouts to pay themselves a
dividend to take advantage of easier access to loans and bonds,
according to a report from  Fitch Ratings .  Improved financing conditions at a time of volatile equity
markets and valuation disputes between buyers and sellers means
more buyout companies will refinance debt to raise funds for
payouts, Frankfurt-based analyst Matthias Volkmer said today in
the report.  “Many leveraged buyouts are at or beyond the typical
private equity investment period and dividend recaps remain
tempting exit options, particularly as funds approach expiry,”
Volkmer said in the report. Buyout firms will “tap windows of
high credit market demand to seek cheap funding for a dividend
recap on their legacy assets.”  Companies including Formula One, Iglo Group and RAC Ltd
have refinanced loans this month to pay their private-equity
owners dividends, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Loans are expected to be the main source of dividend
payouts rather than high-yield bonds, driven by rising prices of
outstanding the debt and managers of collateralized loan
obligations opting to recycle funds, according to the report.  Deals will have lower leverage levels than during the
2006-2007 credit boom and be limited to companies with a stable
business model and global appeal, Fitch said. Leverage or debt
times earnings would be 4.5 to 5 times earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization compared with an average of
6.4 times in 40 deals analyzed by Fitch in 2006, the rating
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
