Isis, the mobile-payment joint
venture backed by  AT&T Inc. (T) ,  Verizon Wireless  and T-Mobile USA
Inc., began service today in  Salt Lake City  and Austin, Texas,
after strategy-related delays.  The application is available through Google Play store and
requires an American Express, Capital One, Chase credit card or
Isis cash card to activate the Isis Mobile Wallet, the companies
said today in a statement. Customers will need Isis enabled
smartphones that include a secure SIM card and near-field
communication technology, or NFC.  Isis, which will let users pay for items at stores using
their mobile phones, had previously planned to roll out the
service in the first half of 2012. The joint venture tweaked its
strategy last year, opting to use credit-card companies to
handle transactions rather than the carriers themselves, and
itâ€™s taken time to ensure that payments can be made securely.  Carriers are planning to use Isis to capture some of the
transaction fees from user purchases. The push is part of an
effort to find new sources of revenue through data services.
 Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the only major carrier left out of the Isis
partnership, uses Google Wallet as one of its mobile pay
services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
