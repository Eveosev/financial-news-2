Alexander Fishenko, owner of
Houston-based Arc Electronics Inc., pleaded not guilty in a
Brooklyn, New York, federal court to illegally exporting
microelectronics to Russian military and intelligence agencies.  Fishenko, a U.S. citizen formerly of Kazakhstan, appeared
today before U.S. District Judge Sterling Johnson. He’s accused
in a 25-count indictment of violating the International
Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Arms Export Control Act,
obstructing justice and operating as an unregistered agent of
the Russian government.  Arc shipped at least $50 million worth of technology goods
to  Russia  without an export license, the government alleged. Ten
other individuals, most of whom were employees of either Arc or
a Moscow-based procurement firm Apex System LLC, were charged in
the indictment, which was unsealed on Oct. 3.  The computer chips supplied by Arc appear similar to those
used in missiles and fighter jets, the government said in court
papers. One of the end users of the electronics was the  Federal
Security Service , successor to the KGB spy agency, according to
the filings.  A lawyer for Fishenko,  Richard Rosenberg , who was appointed
by the court today, said in a phone interview after the hearing
that he wasn’t sure whether his client will seek bail. He
declined to comment further.  The case is U.S. v. Fishenko, 1:12-cr-626, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York ( Brooklyn ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
