Ukrainian grain traders will slow
purchases of wheat for exports after the government announced
restrictions last week, according to UkrAgroConsult.  “We believe the traders will begin to slow their purchases
after the announcement of restrictions,” the Kiev-based
agriculture researcher said in an e-mailed statement today.  Domestic prices have stayed high as traders were making
purchases to fulfill previously signed contracts, the researcher
said. Traders should be “cautious” when signing wheat export
contracts, First Deputy Agriculture Minister Ivan Bisyuk said
Oct. 19. He said that shipments this season may be 5.3 million
metric tons by Nov. 15-20, a point that threatens to exhaust the
country’s exportable surplus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
