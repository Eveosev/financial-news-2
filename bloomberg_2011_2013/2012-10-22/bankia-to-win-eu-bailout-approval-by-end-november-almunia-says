Bankia and three other Spanish
lenders will win European Union approval for government bailouts
by the end of November, EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin
Almunia  said.  “The Bank of  Spain , the Commission and the management of
the four entities have been working on their restructuring plans
during the summer, and the commission will take a decision
approving them by the end of November,” Almunia said in the
text of a speech he gave in Barcelona today.  Restructuring plans for Spanish banks that received help
may need to make balance-sheet reductions and accept bans on
acquisitions or price leadership, Almunia said prepared remarks
for a speech in Barcelona today. The balance sheet reductions
may be caused by the transfer of impaired assets to Spain’s bad
bank, called SAREB, he said.  Banco de Valencia SA (BVA) , Novo Caixa Galicia Banco and Grupo
Caixa Catalunya will also win EU authorization for the aid, he
said.  Banks that receive government support require EU approval
for the aid and must draw up restructuring plans that may
require them to sell units or accept curbs on their business to
compensate for the advantage the state aid gives them over
rivals.  According to Spanish plans, “the whole Spanish financial
system will be fully capitalized by mid-2013 at the latest,”
Almunia said.  Banco Popular Espanol SA is among banks that have to
present recapitalization plans by the end of October, Almunia
said, and they can seek government funding if they aren’t able
to obtain private capital by the end of June 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
