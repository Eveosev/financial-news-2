Canadian and Bakken crude grades
weakened as the Keystone oil pipeline’s restart was delayed for
a second day, constraining oil flows.  TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  expects to restart the Keystone pipeline
today after it was shut Oct. 17 after an anomaly was found
during routine maintenance. The 590,000-barrel-a-day line was
scheduled to resume operations Oct. 20, but bad weather at the
site of the repairs on a section of the pipe that crosses the
border from  Missouri  to Illinois delayed repairs.  Syncrude, a synthetic light Canadian blend, lost its
premium to West Texas Intermediate, falling $3.25 to a discount
of $2.50 a barrel as of 4:19 p.m.  New York  time, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  Bakken crude from  North Dakota  also lost its premium,
falling $2.50 to a $2 discount against WTI. Keystone doesn’t
transport Bakken crude, though the grade competes for space with
Canadian crudes on  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s Mainline pipeline that
carries oil to the U.S. Midwest.  The spread between WTI and North Sea Brent crude widened
for the first time in four trading days, making imported oil
more expensive and boosting the price of some crude grades
produced in the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium widened 25 cents to $20.25
a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
