Grain exports  from  Russia , the
world’s third-biggest wheat shipper last season, will slow
through June because of high prices, said Dmitry Rylko, general
director of the Institute for Agricultural Market Studies.  Russia’s exports this month may be 2 million to 2.5 million
metric tons, Rylko said by phone in Moscow today. Shipments were
3.16 million tons last month, according to Agriculture Ministry
data. The last time Russia sold wheat in a tender to  Egypt  was
Sept. 13, according to data on Bloomberg.  “There are almost no new contracts signed because our
domestic prices are higher than world prices,” Rylko said.
“We are not competitive.”  Wheat for December delivery rose 1.1 percent to $8.8175 a
bushel on the Chicago board of trade by 4:24 p.m. Moscow time.
That is equivalent to $324 a ton.  Russia’s exports were 9.5 million tons this season through
mid-October, Rylko said. Total exports for the season that
started July 1 are forecast at 12 million to 12.5 million tons,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
