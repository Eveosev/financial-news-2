New York Knicks power forward Amar’e Stoudemire will probably miss the start of the National
Basketball Association regular season with a ruptured cyst in
the left knee that will keep him out for two to three weeks.  The Knicks are scheduled to open the regular season on Nov.
1 in  Brooklyn , New York, against the Nets. They host the  Miami
Heat  the following day.  “It seems like he can’t catch a break,” Knicks forward
 Carmelo Anthony  told reporters after yesterday’s practice
session at  Syracuse University . “Hopefully it’s nothing too
serious. We’ve got his back and the most important thing is for
him to get healthy right now and to take that time to do that.”  The 6-foot-10 Stoudemire was the Knicks’ second-leading
scorer last season, averaging 17.5 points and 7.8 rebounds. He
missed 19 games because of a bulging disc in his back and the
death of his brother, and then made headlines when he cut his
hand and required surgery after punching a fire extinguisher
case following a playoff loss to the Heat.  Stoudemire appeared in only one preseason game for the
Knicks, playing 27 minutes against Toronto on Oct. 19 and
scoring 18 points with five rebounds. The Knicks said they may
use Anthony at power forward in place of Stoudemire, while Kurt Thomas will also see extended time during his absence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
