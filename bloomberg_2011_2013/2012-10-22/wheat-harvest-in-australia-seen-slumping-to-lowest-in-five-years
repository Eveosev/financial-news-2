Wheat production in  Australia , the
world’s second-biggest shipper, will probably decline 28 percent
to the lowest level in five years, missing a government estimate,
after dry weather reduced yields.  The  harvest (ALHVS)  will total 21.2 million metric tons in the
2012-2013 marketing year, according to the median of estimates
from four analysts and two traders compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with 23.25 million tons in a survey last month and an
official forecast of 22.5 million tons. The crop was a record
29.5 million tons last year.  Wheat climbed 33 percent this year as dry weather in parts
of the European Union and  Russia  cut global stockpiles to the
lowest in four years, helping boost  food costs  7.7 percent the
past three months. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its
estimate for Australian output 12 percent to 23 million tons on
Oct. 11. That may be lowered by 2 million tons in coming reports
because of dry conditions, said Rabobank International.  “Western Australia had a very prolonged dry stretch
through the cropping year,” said  David Johnson , general manager
of risk and pricing at Emerald Group Australia Pty in Melbourne.
Eastern Australia “hasn’t been getting convincing rain to be
able to fulfill crop potential, so the crop has just been slowly
declining.”  The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics and Sciences, or Abares, will revise its estimate in
December.  Price Gains  Wheat for delivery in December declined 0.9 percent to
$8.70 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 4:41 p.m. in
 Singapore . Futures rose 0.7 percent yesterday, advancing for the
fourth straight session. The grain is the best performer this
year on the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities.  CBH Group, Western Australia’s top grain handler, said Oct.
3 it expects to receive from the region between 9.1 million tons
and 9.3 million tons this  harvest , down from a record 15 million
tons last year, after a dry July and August. That compares with
its prediction of 9 million tons to 10 million tons on Sept. 5.  Western Australia’s southwest had the driest  July  on record
while the state had below-average rainfall in August and near-
average rain in September, according to the Bureau of
Meteorology. Wheat  output  in the nation’s biggest producer may
drop 39 percent to 7.1 million tons, according to Abares.  “The crop has been really under pressure the whole way
through,” Emerald’s Johnson said by phone Oct. 19. The east
coast is set for an average year, he said.  Global stockpiles will be 173 million tons on May 31, down
from a previous estimate of 176.71 million, the USDA said Oct.
11. World output was forecast at 653.05 million tons, down 0.9
percent from the prediction a month earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
