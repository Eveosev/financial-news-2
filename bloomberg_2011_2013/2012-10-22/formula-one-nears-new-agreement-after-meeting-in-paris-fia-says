Formula One’s governing body said it
expects a new agreement setting out the sport’s guidelines to be
signed in the coming weeks following a meeting in Paris.  Federation Internationale de l’Automobile President Jean Todt and Formula One Chief Executive Officer Bernie Ecclestone
met principals from the 12 teams yesterday to present them with
the new conditions of entry for the so-called Concorde Agreement
starting in 2013, the FIA said in  statement .  The meeting resulted in a “fruitful and helpful debate on
how the new structure would operate in 2013 and beyond,” the
Paris-based FIA said late yesterday on its website.  The current agreement that dictates the terms under which
teams compete in the most-watched auto racing series expires
after the 2012 season.  “A further important step has been achieved today to
secure the future of the F-1 world championship, which should
lead to a final settlement to be reached between the FIA, the
commercial rights holder and the teams in the coming weeks,”
the governing body said.  There are four races remaining in the 20-event 2012 world
championship, starting with the Indian Grand Prix in five days.
The series concludes Nov. 25 in  Brazil .  To contact the reporter on this story:
