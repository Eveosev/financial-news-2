Srbijagas JP, Serbia’s natural gas
monopoly, seeks to borrow 190 million euros ($247.6 million)
worth of sovereign-backed loans from seven banks.  The aid for the liquidity-stricken Srbijagas needs
parliamentary approval. The company wants to borrow 50 million
euros from the London-based  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  and 20 million
euros from Amsterdam Trade Bank NV, according to a  draft bill 
the government submitted to lawmakers today.  The Belgrade-based Volksbank AD would provide 70 million
euros, Serbian units of  Hungary ’s  OTP Bank PLC (OTP) ,  Societe Generale
SA (GLE)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  10 million euros each, and Vojvodjanska
Banka AD, member of  Greece ’s  National Bank of Greece SA , would
lend 20 million euros.  The new loan needs to be cleared by parliament’s finance
committee before lawmakers take it up for a vote. The
government, which fully owns Srbijagas, asked parliament to back
sovereign guarantees for the seven loans, as Srbijagas
traditionally increases imports in the last quarter of the year.  Srbijagas owed more than 60 billion dinars to banks at the
end of 2011, of which two thirds were already long-term loans.
The new, five-year loans come with a one-year grace period and
quarterly debt repayments. The cost of new borrowing ranges from
5.98 percent and 7.25 percent on top of a three-month Euribor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
