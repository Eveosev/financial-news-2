The Australian dollar slid versus
most of its major peers before a report this week that may show
inflation held near the slowest in 13 years, providing scope for
the central bank to cut borrowing costs.  The so-called Aussie remained lower following a two-day
drop against its U.S. counterpart after  Australia ’s government
said it will reduce spending to help deliver a  budget surplus 
this fiscal year, boosting expectations the  Reserve Bank  will
cut its key rate at a meeting next month. The currency also
weakened as Asian stocks extended a global decline in equities.  “The Aussie is soft and likely to remain soft heading into
the inflation release,” said Emma Lawson, a Sydney-based
foreign-exchange strategist at National Australia Bank Ltd.
“The currency is looking at the broader global conditions this
week and we’re clearly starting off on a more subdued note.”  Australia’s dollar was at $1.0327 at 5:15 p.m. in Sydney
from $1.0331 on Oct. 19, when it fell 0.3 percent. It bought
82.19 yen from 81.93 at the end of last week. Australian bonds
advanced, pushing the yield on Australia’s  10-year note  down by
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.14 percent.  New Zealand ’s dollar traded at 81.87 U.S. cents from 81.57
last week. The country’s markets are closed today for a holiday.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares fell 0.2 percent
after earlier falling as much as 0.8 percent. The  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  of U.S. shares dropped 1.7 percent on Oct. 19,
and the Stoxx Europe 600 Index declined 0.8 percent.  Core Inflation  The so-called  trimmed mean  gauge of core consumer prices in
Australia probably rose 2.2 percent in the three months ended
Sept. 30 from a year earlier, according to the median estimate
of economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News  before the statistics
bureau publishes its inflation report on Oct 24. That compares
with a 2 percent increase in the previous quarter, the slowest
pace since June 1999. The  Reserve Bank of Australia  targets
average annual inflation of 2 percent to 3 percent.  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 97 percent chance policy makers will cut the overnight
cash rate target by 25 basis points to 3 percent at their next
meeting on Nov. 6. The probability has increased from 89 percent
a week ago.  “While global headwinds, a high dollar and changing
consumer behavior are weighing on some sectors, the Australian
economy is expected to outperform every major advanced economy
this year and next, with growth underpinned by strong
investment, strong growth in export volumes and solid growth in
consumption,” Treasurer  Wayne Swan  said in a statement in
Canberra today accompanying the government’s mid-year budget
review.  Budget Surplus  The government’s underlying cash surplus will be A$1.08
billion ($1.12 billion) for 2012-13, compared with a A$1.54
billion surplus seen in May, according to the review. Spending
is forecast to be A$363.2 billion compared with a May projection
of A$364.2 billion, while the revenue estimate was cut to A$367
billion from $A368.8 billion.  “The extra spending cuts aren’t a welcome outcome from an
Australian growth perspective,”  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) 
analysts including Sydney-based Alex Stanley wrote in a note to
clients. “The additional fiscal tightening unveiled today
reminds us that the burden for managing slower growth and higher
unemployment will continue to fall to the RBA.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
