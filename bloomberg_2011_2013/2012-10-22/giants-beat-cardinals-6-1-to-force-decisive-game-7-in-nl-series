The San Francisco Giants beat the
St. Louis Cardinals 6-1 to force a decisive seventh game in the
National League Championship Series as pitcher Ryan Vogelsong
allowed just one run for the third straight postseason game.   San Francisco has won the past two games against the
defending  World Series  champions to erase a 3-1 deficit and tie
the best-of-seven Major League Baseball playoff series at three
games apiece.    The Giants will now host Game 7 tomorrow at AT&T Park in
San Francisco, with the winner advancing to face the Detroit
Tigers in the World Series. The Tigers swept the  New York 
Yankees 4-0 in the American League Championship Series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
