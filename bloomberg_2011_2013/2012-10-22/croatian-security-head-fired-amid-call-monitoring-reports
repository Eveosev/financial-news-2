Croatia ’s national-security chief,
Petar Misevic, has been dismissed by Prime Minister  Zoran Milanovic  and President Ivo Josipovic amid media reports of
illegal call-monitoring of officials and businessmen.  “While we have not found any wrongdoing, the scope of our
search is limited, and we brought a joint decision to replace
the head of the  National Security Council ,” Milanovic told said
at a joint briefing with Josipovic in Zagreb today.  The parliamentary committee for national security will
investigate further, Milanovic said. Josipovic said Misevic’s
dismissal was part of an intelligence overhaul that included the
recent replacement of the head of the Security and Intelligence
Agency, one of the security bodies overseen by the council,
which reports to the premier and the president.  Misevic has yet to comment publicly on reports that police
overstepped their authority in monitoring lists of calls by
prominent individuals, which newspapers Vecernji List and
Jutarnji List published today, citing people they didn’t name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
