Blame the  New York Yankees 
themselves, not the Cuomo family, for the team’s failure to get
to the  World Series  this year, Governor  Andrew Cuomo  said.  A New York Daily News column yesterday suggested that
having a Cuomo in the Executive Mansion hexes the Bronx-based
baseball team, which has a record 27 World Series titles. The
team has never made it to the World Series in any year that
Cuomo, or his father, Mario, was in office. The elder Cuomo
served as governor from 1983 through 1994.  “I think not playing well in the playoffs is the Yankees
curse,” Cuomo, a first-term Democrat in his second year, said
today at a news conference in Albany. “That was the problem.”  The Yankees were swept by the Detroit Tigers this month,
knocking them from the playoffs and ending their chances of
reaching Major League Baseball’s championship series. In the 16
seasons between Cuomos, the Yankees made the series seven times,
winning five titles.  “Other sports teams have done very, very well under
Cuomos,” the 54-year-old governor said.  While he or his father was governor, the Mets won the World
Series, the football Giants won three Super Bowls, and the
Rangers and Islanders won the National Hockey League’s Stanley
Cup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
