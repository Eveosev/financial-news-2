Day-ahead electricity in  Germany ,
 Europe ’s biggest economy, advanced on forecasts for below-
average wind production and lower available generating capacity.  Baseload power for the next working day, for supplies
delivered around the clock, rose 8.3 percent as available
generating capacity is predicted to fall 2.1 percent.  Electricity for tomorrow added 3.95 euros to 51.65 euros
($67.43) a megawatt-hour at 5:20 p.m. Berlin time, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract settled at 51.09
euros in a daily auction on European Energy Exchange AG.  Wind generation is forecast to drop to 2 to 3 gigawatts
tomorrow, Meteologica SA, a Madrid-based weather forecaster,
said on its website. That’s below an average level of 5.3
gigawatts, according to data from Leipzig, Germany-based EEX on
Bloomberg.  Available capacity  is set to decline to 65.1 gigawatts
tomorrow from 66.5 gigawatts today, EEX data show.  The maximum temperature in  Frankfurt  will be 18 degrees
Celsius (64 Fahrenheit) versus a five-year average of 10
degrees, CustomWeather Inc. data show.  The weather in Europe this winter will, on average, be
warmer than usual, Weather Services International Ltd. said in
an e-mailed statement.  “As we head into November, it appears we may have a
stretch of rather cold weather across much of Europe early in
the month,” WSI said. “Climate models are suggesting that
January and February may be particularly warm and wet across
western/northern Europe.”  RWE AG (RWE)  had an unplanned halt at its 590-megawatt
Weisweiler-G lignite-fed plant, according to the company’s
website. The unit is scheduled to start today. EON AG had a
generator fault at its 550MW gas-fed Irsching-4 power plant
