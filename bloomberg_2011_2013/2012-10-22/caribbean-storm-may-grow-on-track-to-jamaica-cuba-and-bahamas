A tropical storm watch was issued
for  Jamaica  as the Atlantic hurricane season’s eighteenth system
began to take shape in the Caribbean Sea.  The depression that formed today may grow into Tropical
Storm Sandy as it nears Jamaica on a northeasterly track that
will probably cross Cuba and the Bahamas later this week,
according to a U.S.  National Hurricane Center  advisory at 11
a.m.  New York  time.  “The cyclone could be near hurricane strength as it is
approaching Jamaica on Wednesday,” the center said. Tropical
storm conditions are possible on the island by late tomorrow.  If Sandy forms, the 2012 Atlantic season would tie 1969 as
the fourth-most active on record, according to Weather
Underground in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. The most active year was
2005, when 28 storms formed, including  Hurricane Katrina .  The depression is about 320 miles (515 kilometers) south-
southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, with winds of 30 miles per hour.
A system becomes a tropical storm and gets a name when its winds
reach 39 mph.  A reconnaissance aircraft will take measurements inside the
system later today, according to the hurricane center in Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
