The yield on  India ’s 10-year
government  bonds  held at the lowest level in almost three months
on speculation monetary policy will be eased next week.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will reduce the cash reserve
 ratio  by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent on Oct. 30, according
to 11 of 18 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News . One predicted
a 50 basis point cut, while the rest see no change. The RBI has
held its benchmark repurchase rate at 8 percent since April. Six
of the analysts surveyed are forecasting a 25 basis point cut on
Oct. 30, two expect a 50 basis point reduction, while the
remaining 10 predict no change.  “Yields are edging down as some loosening of monetary
policy is expected,” said  Paresh Nayar , head of money-market
and currency trading at FirstRand Ltd. in Mumbai. “That could
either be a cash reserves-ratio cut or a repo-rate reduction.”  The yield on the benchmark 8.15 percent notes due June 2022
held at 8.13 percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The rate is the lowest since July 27.  The one-year interest-rate swap, derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.59 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
