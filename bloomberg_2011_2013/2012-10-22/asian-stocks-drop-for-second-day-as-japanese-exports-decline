Asian  stocks  fell, with the regional
benchmark index retreating after its biggest weekly advance in a
month, as Japan’s exports dropped and companies including
Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. forecast lower earnings.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , the Japanese maker of construction machinery
that gets 14 percent of sales from  China , slid 2.4 percent in
 Tokyo . Treasury Wine Estates slumped 7.3 percent in Sydney after
Australia’s biggest wine maker forecast a drop in first-half
earnings. GrainCorp Ltd. jumped 39 percent after Archer-Daniels-
Midland Co. offered to buy the Australian grain handler. Hong
Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  completed its longest streak of daily
advances since July 2010.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  declined for a second day,
falling 0.3 percent to 123.21 as of 7:37 p.m. in Tokyo, with
about five stocks dropping for every four that rose. The gauge
last week posted its biggest weekly advance in a month after
reports on U.S. retail sales and manufacturing beat estimates
and  China’s economy  showed signs of stabilization.  “Markets have had a pretty strong rebound already,” said
Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset allocation  at
AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages almost $100 billion.
“The outlook for company earnings are being revised down and
that’s affecting market sentiment. Any market correction is good
and likely to be short-lived as investors will likely use any
weakness as a buying opportunity. Even though earnings are
slowing, they’re not collapsing.”  Currency Intervention  South Korea’s Kospi Index lost 0.1 percent. Australia’s
 S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  fell 0.7 percent. Taiwan’s Taiex Index dropped
0.5 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2 percent.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index gained 0.7 percent, extending
gains for an eighth day, the longest such streak since July
2010. The city’s de facto central bank stepped in for the first
time since 2009 to prevent the currency from rising against the
 U.S. dollar  as funds flow into the market.  Hong Kong  Exchanges &
Clearing Ltd., the city’s bourse operator, rose 3.5 percent to
HK$125.60.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.1 percent,
reversing losses of as much as 1.5 percent, as the yen weakened
amid speculation the  Bank of Japan  will add stimulus at a
meeting next week. Shares fell earlier after companies including
Mitsubishi Corp. cut profit forecasts.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.4
percent today. The gauge fell 1.7 percent on Oct. 19 after
Microsoft Corp. and General Electric reported earnings that
missed estimates. As well, purchases of existing houses dropped
1.7 percent to a 4.75 million annual rate, matching the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, figures from the
National Association of Realtors showed on Oct. 19 in
Washington.  Japanese Exporters  Japanese exporters dropped as shipments slid 10.3 percent
in September from a year earlier, leaving a trade deficit of
558.6 billion yen ($7 billion), the  Finance Ministry  said in
Tokyo today. The median forecast in a  Bloomberg News  survey of
analysts was for a 9.9 percent export decline. Imports rose 4.1
percent. The decline in shipments, exacerbated by a spat with
China over islands in the  East China Sea , was the biggest since
May last year.  Komatsu declined 2.4 percent to 1,710 yen. Fanuc Corp., a
Japanese maker of factory robots, slipped 2.5 percent to 12,960
yen.  Renesas Electronics Corp. (6723) , the world’s largest maker of
microcontrollers that gets about 15 percent of sales from China,
dropped 2 percent to 292 yen.  Raw-material producers posted the biggest decline among the
 10 industry groups  in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Oil fell a
third day in its longest losing streak in almost a month. Copper
futures in London headed for a second day of decline.  Rio Tinto Group (RIO) , the world’s second-biggest mining company
by market value, decreased 2.4 percent to A$57.75. Woodside
Petroleum Ltd., Australia’s No. 2 oil producer, slipped 1
percent to A$35.61.  Profit Target  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rebounded 13 percent through
Oct. 19 from this year’s low on June 4 as stimulus measures in
Europe, the U.S., Japan and China boosted  market sentiment  amid
a global economic slowdown and Europe’s debt crisis. The Asian
benchmark traded at 13.2 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 13.7 for the S&P 500 and 12.2 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index.  Treasury Wine Estates slumped 7.3 percent to A$5.10 in
Sydney after forecasting first-half earnings would drop 20
percent on higher costs and a reduced grape harvest.  Of the 37 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
reported earnings since Oct. 1, 62 percent missed earnings
estimates, while 38 percent exceeded expectations, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News. More than 100 companies in
Australia, India, Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan are
scheduled to post results this weeks.  Mitsubishi Corp., which gets 45 percent of revenue from
energy and metals, fell 1.8 percent to 1,404 yen after cutting
its annual profit target by 34 percent to 330 billion yen and
reducing the dividend forecast by 28 percent to 50 yen a share.  Amada Co. (6113)  slid 1.7 percent to 409 yen after the Japanese
machinery maker cut its full-year profit forecast by 58 percent
to 5 billion yen.  Jupiter Telecom  Among stocks that advanced, Jupiter Telecommunications Co.,
controlled by KDDI Corp. and Sumitomo Corp., surged 18 to 97,700
yen in Tokyo, the most on the regional gauge, Jupiter  will buy
Japan Cablenet Ltd. to control half of the country’s cable
television market, the Nikkei newspaper reported, without saying
where it obtained the information.  Keiichi Sakurai, a spokesman at KDDI, and Jupiter’s
spokeswoman Keiko Ajikata said by telephone today the companies
weren’t the source of the information. Sumitomo didn’t provide
the information for the report, the company said in statement on
its website.  GrainCorp jumped 39 percent to A$12.30,a record closing
price. Archer-Daniels-Midland, the biggest corn processor,
offered A$2.7 billion ($2.8 billion), or A$11.75 a share, in
cash for GrainCorp to gain agricultural shipment assets in
Australia.  China Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd. (1101) , the
country’s largest shipbuilder outside state control, climbed 14
percent to HK$1.58 in Hong Kong after announcing an order for a
deep water barge, the first of its push into the offshore-
equipment market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
