Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest
U.S. coal producer by volume, reported third-quarter earnings
that beat analysts’ estimates after selling more coal from its
mines in  Wyoming ’s Powder River Basin.  Excluding one-time items, per-share profit exceeded the 34-
cent average of 25  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose
to $2.06 billion from $2.04 billion. Net income fell to $42.9
million, or 16 cents a share, from $274.1 million, or $1, a year
earlier, the St. Louis-based company said today in a statement
distributed by PRNewswire.  Higher natural gas prices encouraged some electricity
generators to resume burning coal from the Powder River Basin,
Mitesh Thakkar, an analyst at FBR & Co. in Arlington,  Virginia ,
wrote in an Oct. 18 note. Thakkar rates the shares outperform,
the equivalent of a buy. Gas prices rose 23 percent from the
prior three months to average $2.893 per million British thermal
units in New York during the third quarter.  “At those prices, we believe utilities should favor PRB
and ILB coals over natural gas,” Thakkar wrote in an Oct. 18
note, referring to the Powder River Basin and the Illinois Basin
in the U.S. Midwest.  The earnings were released before the start of regular
trading in New York. Peabody fell 5.6 percent to $25.89 on Oct.
19.  The shares  have declined 22 percent this year.  -- Editors: Jasmina Kelemen, Steven Frank  To contact the reporter on this story:
