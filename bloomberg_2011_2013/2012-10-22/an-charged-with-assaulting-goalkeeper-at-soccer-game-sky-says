A 21-year-old man has been charged
with assault after an attack on a goalkeeper in an English match
three days ago, Sky reported.  Aaron Cawley, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, has been 
charged with assault and entering the field of play by South 
Yorkshire Police.  It follows the incident at Sheffield Wednesday’s home game
with Leeds United. Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland fell to
the ground after a fan came on to the field during the 1-1 draw
and pushed him in the face.       Cawley is due to appear before Sheffield magistrates’ this
morning, Sky said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
