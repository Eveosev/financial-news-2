AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Gold Fields
Ltd. (GFI)  and Harmony Gold Mining Co.,  Africa ’s largest producers of
the metal, agreed in principle with South African unions on the
contents of a deal aimed at ending a wave of strikes.  The parties plan to sign an agreement on Oct. 25, the
Chamber of Mines, an industry body that negotiates on behalf of
the companies, said today in an e-mailed statement. The  chamber 
met today with labor groups including South Africa’s biggest
union, the National Union of Mineworkers, after improving an
offer to workers last week.  The strikes, which began in the platinum industry and
spread to gold, chrome and iron-ore operations, have hurt
companies already grappling with rising costs. Workers have
walked out without heeding legal resolution procedures, leading
producers to dismiss or threaten to dismiss employees.  “Today’s discussions were positive and there is a
collective resolve by all the parties to end the unprotected
action as soon as possible,” Elize Strydom, the chamber’s chief
negotiator, said in the statement.  As many as 46 people died in August as workers protested at
Lonmin Plc’s Marikana operations before the company agreed to
wage increases of up to 22 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
