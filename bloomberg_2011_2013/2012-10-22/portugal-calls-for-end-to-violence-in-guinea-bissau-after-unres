The  Portuguese government  called for
an end to violence in Guinea Bissau following another case of
military unrest in the West African country.  “The Portuguese government views with concern the
situation in Guinea Bissau,” Portugal’s Foreign Ministry said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday evening. “There is no
military solution to the problems that Guinea Bissau is
confronted with,” it said.  At least seven people were killed on Oct. 21 after gunmen
raided an army barrack in Guinea Bissau, a former Portuguese
colony, AFP reported on Sunday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
