Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) ,
the biggest publicly traded copper producer, reported third-
quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates for the first
time in 17  quarters  as costs rose and gold sales fell more than
expected.  Net income dropped 22 percent to $824 million, or 86 cents
a share, from $1.05 billion, or $1.10, a year ago, Phoenix-based
Freeport said today in a statement. Earnings excluding credits
for environmental adjustments and tax claims were 68 cents a
share, trailing the 73-cent average  estimate  of 21 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net cash costs rose to $1.62 a pound of copper from 80
cents in the third quarter of 2011, according to the statement
Costs were higher mainly because of lower volumes in  Indonesia ,
the company said.  “The miss was largely attributable to higher-than-expected
production costs across all divisions, continuing a trend seen
across the sector,”  Tony Robson , an analyst at BMO Capital
Markets in  London , said in a note today.  Revenue declined 15 percent to $4.42 billion, beating the
$4.36 billion average of 13 estimates. Copper sales totaled 922
million pounds, compared with 947 million pounds a year earlier
and a July 19 forecast of 885 million pounds. Brian Yu, an
analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  San Francisco , had estimated sales
of 888 million pounds.  Gold Sales  Gold sales fell 51 percent to 202,000 ounces, missing a
July forecast of 225,000 ounces, Freeport said. Gold volumes
reflected changes to the mine plan at the company’s Grasberg
operation in Indonesia and a slower-than-expected ramp-up at the
site’s Deep Ore Zone underground project.  “There’s a little bit of a shortfall there on the gold
side but nothing really shocking there coming out of the
quarter,” Kuni Chen, an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut , said by telephone.  Freeport’s Indonesian operations had sales of 195 million
pounds of copper and 384,000 ounces of gold in the third
quarter, compared with 253 million pounds and 384,000 ounces a
year ago.  The Grasberg mine was halted for more than two weeks in the
first quarter and required “extensive repairs” after violence
flared among employees in the aftermath of a three-month strike
last year, Freeport said. Grasberg, which has the world’s
largest recoverable copper reserves, accounted for 19 percent of
Freeport’s revenue last year.  Copper Prices  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange averaged $7,720.85 a metric ton in the quarter, 14
percent less than a year earlier on concern that an economic
slowdown in  China , the biggest consumer of the metal, would
weaken demand.  Freeport cut its forecast for 2012 gold sales to 1 million
ounces. Copper sales are still expected to be 3.6 billion pounds
this year and may rise 19 percent, to 4.3 billion pounds, in
2013, the company said. It also forecast sales of 1.4 million
ounces of gold and 90 million pounds of molybdenum next year.  Freeport, which operates mines in Indonesia,  Africa  and the
Americas, plans to increase annual copper  output  by more than 25
percent in the next three years, Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson said July 19.  The shares fell 1.5 percent to $40.58 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
