Some Brazilian officials are pushing
for a renewal of the government’s economic team, Brasilia-based
Correio Braziliense reported.  Central Bank President Alexandre Tombini would be the most
likely person to replace Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  in the
event of a shake-up, columnist Vicente Nunes wrote today,
without citing any sources.  President Dilma Rousseff’s office declined to comment. The
Finance Ministry did not return calls requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
