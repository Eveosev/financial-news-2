The rand strengthened for the first
time in three days before the release of data this week that may
show inflation is accelerating, reducing the chance of a
central-bank interest-rate cut.  The currency gained as much as 0.7 percent to 8.6012 per
dollar and traded at 8.6103 as of 3:59 p.m. in Johannesburg, the
best performer of 16 major currencies monitored by Bloomberg.
Yields on 6.75 percent bonds due March 2021 dropped one basis
point to 6.61 percent, a three-week low.  The consumer inflation  rate  probably climbed for a second
month in September, rising to 5.2 percent from 5 percent, a
report on Oct. 24 will show, according to the median estimate of
19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Producer inflation likely
accelerated to 5.4 percent from 5.1 percent, a report may show a
day later, according to the median of 14 economist estimates.
The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee meets on Nov. 22 to
decide on borrowing costs.  Rising inflation would “reinforce the majority view for
the Monetary Policy Committee to stand still,” Bruce Donald, a
currency strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., wrote in an e-
mailed note to clients. “This could be mildly rand-positive.”  Foreign investors  bought  a net 3.14 billion rand ($365
million) of South African bonds last week, reversing sales of
1.5 billion rand the week before. Year-to-date sales reached
85.6 billion rand, the most on record. Forward-rate agreements
rose last week, signaling that traders are paring bets for a
rate cut within the next six months.  “Market talk is that there has been light buying interest
from local funds, international names and local banks alike,”
Quinten Bertenshaw, a Johannesburg-based analyst at ETM
analytics, wrote in e-mailed comments on Oct. 19.  The South African Reserve Bank unexpectedly cut its
benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points to 5 percent on July 19
to support growth in  Africa ’s biggest economy. Inflation will
probably average 5.2 percent next year, up from an earlier
estimate of 5.1 percent, Governor Gill Marcus said on Sept. 20,
when she kept the repo rate unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
