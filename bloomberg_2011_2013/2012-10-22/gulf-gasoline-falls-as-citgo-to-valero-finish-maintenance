Gasoline weakened on the Gulf Coast
today as Citgo Petroleum Corp. and  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
refineries completed maintenance.  Citgoâ€™s East and West plants in  Corpus Christi , which shut
units for work on Oct. 1, completed a turnaround and began
starting operations on Oct. 20, according to a message on a
community hotline. Valero plans to start a hydrocracker and a
reformer at its McKee refinery in Sunray,  Texas , and expects to
release emissions until Oct. 24, after starting a fluid
catalytic cracker last week.  The refineries have a combined capacity of 335,000 barrels
a day, 3.8 percent of total  Gulf Coast capacity , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Supplies in the region gained
 998,000 barrels  a day last week to 70.4 million, the highest
level since Aug. 10, the Energy Department reported.  The price for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, sank 3.03 cents to trade at a  discount  of
15.63 cents a barrel over futures on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange at 11:01 a.m.  Prompt delivery  dropped by 3.59 cents to
$2.5344, a ninth consecutive decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
