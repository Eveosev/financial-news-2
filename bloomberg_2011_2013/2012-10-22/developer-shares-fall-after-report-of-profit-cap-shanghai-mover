China Vanke Co. (000002) ,  Poly Real Estate
Group Co. (600048)  and  Gemdale Corp. (600383)  led shares of developers lower after
the China Securities Journal reported that Shaanxi province
imposed a cap on profit margins for property projects.  Vanke, the nation’s largest listed developer, fell as much
as 2 percent in Shenzhen, the biggest intraday drop in two
weeks. The stock was trading 1.5 percent lower at 8.29 yuan as
of the 11:30 a.m. local time trading break. Poly Real Estate and
Gemdale each dropped 1.1 percent in Shanghai.  A gauge  of
developers listed in the city slid 0.5 percent as China’s
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index sank 0.6 percent.  The China Securities Journal reported today that Shaanxi
authorities told cities in the province to limit developers’
profit margins for residential projects to 10 percent. That
followed an Oct. 19 report by the  Shanghai  Securities News that
cited a housing ministry researcher calling for China to avoid
large profits for developers and Premier Wen Jiabao saying Oct.
17 that the government must continue its property curbs.  “Other provinces may follow Shaanxi to issue a cap on
profit margins of property projects,” Du Jinsong, a Hong Kong-
based analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG, said by telephone.
That’s fueling concern that the government will continue to
impose restrictions on property, leading to the decline in
developer shares, said Du, who rates Vanke “outperform.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
