Ivan Seidenberg , the former chairman
and chief executive officer of  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , said
the directory unit Verizon spun off that later filed for
bankruptcy was healthy and “completely stable.”  Seidenberg, now an advisory partner at Perella Weinberg
Partners, testified at a trial today in federal court in Dallas
where creditors of the directory business are suing Verizon over
the transaction. Verizon wasn’t seeking to unload a dying
business, Seidenberg, 65, testified.  “There was no Hail Mary required,” said Seidenberg, who
retired from Verizon in December. “This business was completely
stable.”  Creditors claim in the lawsuit that New York-based Verizon
loaded the business, Idearc Inc., with $9 billion in debt,
driving it into bankruptcy. The restructuring of Idearc, now
named  SuperMedia Inc. (SPMD) , created a trust to bring lawsuits on
behalf of creditors with claims totaling $6 billion.  The unit was an “extraordinary, capable business” that no
longer fit with Verizon’s core operations, Seidenberg said.
Although the business was contributing more than $1 billion a
year to Verizon, it was not being valued by Verizon investors
because it wasn’t growing, he said.  “We were able to stabilize it,” he said. “We could not
change it was no longer a growth company.”  The lawsuit is U.S. Bank National Association v. Verizon
Communications Inc., 10-01842, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas (Dallas).  To contact the reporters on this story:
