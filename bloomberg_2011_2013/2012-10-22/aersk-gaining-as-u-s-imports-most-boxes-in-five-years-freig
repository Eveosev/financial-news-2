U.S. imports of containerized goods
are the highest since before the recession as the economic
recovery gains traction, boosting rates for A.P. Moeller- Maersk (MAERSKB) 
A/S and other shipping lines.  Imports of everything from car parts to furniture probably
rose 7.9 percent to 4.75 million 40-foot steel boxes in the
third quarter from a year earlier, according to PIERS-JOC, a
 Newark , New Jersey-based research company tracking port volumes.
Shares  of  Maersk, which has the most vessels shipping Asian-made
goods to the U.S., will rise 19 percent in 12 months, based on
the average of 20 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Builders started the most new homes in four years last
month and Americans bought cars at the fastest pace since 2008,
government data show. The biggest expansion in retail sales
since 2010 is boosting  consumer spending , accounting for about
70 percent of the economy, as President  Barack Obama  seeks a
second term in elections Nov. 6. That contrasts with shipping,
where the gains are being limited by a glut of capacity as
owners contend with the biggest fleet in history.  “The imports are consistent with the macroeconomic picture
in the U.S., and things just turned significantly better,” said
Nigel Prentis, the head of research at HSBC Shipping Ltd., a
London-based shipbroker and consultant. “As far as that
translates into freight rates for box ships, that will depend on
the supply side. There are an awful lot of ships.”  Annual Contracts  The cost of shipping a standard 40-foot box to the U.S.
West Coast from China, the world’s busiest trade route, rose 48
percent to $2,510 this year, based on data from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) ,
the largest shipbroker. Container lines are seeking an $800
increase per box in annual contracts that typically start May 1,
according to the Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, a group
of 15 shipping companies.  Maersk, the largest container line by market value, will
report a 44 percent gain in net income to 21.9 billion kroner
($3.8 billion) for this year, according to the mean of 18
analyst estimates. The Copenhagen-based company also owns  oil
tankers  and drilling rigs, with container shipping generating 45
percent of revenue, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Its shares
rose 6.5 percent to 40,400 kroner this year and are  predicted  to
reach 48,060 kroner in 12 months.  The shipping line controls 9.6 percent of capacity sailing
to  North America  from  Asia , according to data from Alphaliner,
an industry consultant. The next-largest operators are Geneva-
based Mediterranean Shipping Co. and CMA GGM SA, located in
Marseille,  France . The ships are as long as 1,300 feet and can
hold as many as 15,550 boxes.  Car Parts  The predicted third-quarter imports would be the most since
the same period in 2007, with car parts and furniture leading
the gains, according to JOC. New-home construction jumped 15
percent to an annual rate of 872,000 houses in September, the
most since July 2008, the Commerce Department said Oct. 17.
Sales of cars and light trucks reached an annualized 14.9
million vehicles in September, the most since March 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. recovery still has “a long way to go,”  Gene Sperling , head of the National Economic Council, said Oct. 16.
While the unemployment rate of 7.8 percent is the lowest since
Obama took office, it still exceeds the 10-year average by 1.1
percentage points. The  Federal Reserve  announced a third round
of debt-buying on Sept. 13. It bought $2.3 trillion of debt in
the first two rounds from December 2008 through June 2011.  Budget Office  Federal spending cuts and tax increases totaling more than
$600 billion are scheduled to take effect in January unless the
 U.S. Congress  acts. That could trigger a recession, the
 Congressional Budget Office  said in an Aug. 22 report.  Slowing growth elsewhere in the world is curbing gains in
demand for U.S. exports, according to JOC. Containerized exports
will increase 1 percent to 2 percent this year, compared with
6.5 percent in 2011, according to Mario Moreno, a JOC economist.
The 17-nation euro area will contract 0.5 percent this year, and
 China  will expand 7.7 percent, the slowest pace since 1999,
according to the median of as many as 100 economist estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Costs to ship a 20-foot box to  Europe  from China slumped 43
percent to $1,074 since July, Clarkson data show. Maersk removed
eight vessels from the route this month, citing weaker demand,
bringing total capacity cuts this year to 21 percent.  World Trade  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2012 forecast for
growth in world trade by 0.6 percentage point to 3.2 percent on
Oct. 9, down from 5.8 percent last year. The global fleet of
 container ships  will expand 7.5 percent this year, according to
Clarkson. About 90 percent of world trade travels by sea, the
Round Table of International Shipping Associations estimates.  The global container fleet expanded 32 percent since the
end of 2008, when the ships earned 62 percent more than now,
Clarkson data show. Outstanding orders at ship yards are equal
to 21 percent of existing capacity, according to  IHS Inc. (IHS) , an
Englewood, Colorado-based research company.  The glut extends across the merchant fleet. The Baltic Dry
Index, a measure of the cost of shipping coal and  iron ore , fell
36 percent since the start of this year, according to the  Baltic
Exchange , whose data are used as benchmarks for about 75 percent
of commodity cargoes. Earnings for the largest oil tankers
plunged 60 percent to $12,625 a day, Clarkson data show.  U.S. industrial output rose 0.4 percent in September,
beating economists’ forecasts, Federal Reserve data show. Retail
sales climbed 1.1 percent in September after a 1.2 percent gain
the prior month, the biggest back-to-back advance since 2010,
according to the Commerce Department. Twelve of 13 categories
improved, including car dealers and electronics stores.  National Poll  The strengthening indicators may help Obama in a campaign
dominated by the economy. Opinion polls nationwide and in
competitive states show a tight race. Forty-three percent of
respondents in the Bloomberg National Poll of 1,007 adults
conducted Sept. 21 to 24 named unemployment and jobs as the most
important issue facing the country.  The economy will expand 2.1 percent this year, compared
with 1.8 percent in 2011, according to the median of 90
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Containerized imports may
expand 4.5 percent to 17.66 million units this year, the most
since 2007, Moreno of JOC estimates.  “We’ve seen quite good imports into the U.S. for some time
now,” said Frode Moerkedal, an analyst at RS Platou Markets AS
in Oslo, whose recommendations on the shares of shipping
companies returned 7 percent in the past year. “If you look at
rates to the U.S., they’ve been more resilient that for Asia to
Europe. It’s definitely a bright spot.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
