Alan Shaw, the former chief
executive of Codexis, has helped form a new company to convert
gas and methane into new biological feedstocks for chemicals and
fuels.  Calysta Energy is being co-founded by Josh Silverman, who
will be chief scientific officer, the  Menlo Park , California-
based company said.  “Natural gas is an abundant, ideal source of low-cost
carbon, and global natural gas production is expected to double
in the next 30 years,” Shaw said. “However, practical technology
to efficiently capture its potential beyond current usage has
not been developed.’’   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
