Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY) ’s experimental once-
weekly diabetes drug dulaglutide helped patients control their
diabetes better than older treatments in three large studies.  The medicine met its primary goal in reducing hemoglobin
A1c, a measurement of blood sugar control, Indianapolis-based
Lilly said today in a statement. In one study it worked better
than  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  and  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) ’s Byetta and
in another it beat Merck & Co.’s Januvia, the company said.  Lilly said it plans to seek U.S. approval in 2013 for the
drug, which mimics the function of a digestive hormone that
stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin after meals. The
studies were from the final stage of testing generally needed
for U.S. approval.  If approved, the drug would compete with products on the
market and in testing by Bristol-Myers, AstraZeneca,  Novartis
AG (NOVN) ,  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , and  Sanofi. (SAN)  Dulaglutide could have $500
million in sales by 2018, estimated Steve Scala, a Cowen & Co.
analyst in Boston, earlier this month.  Lilly fell 1.1 percent to $52.28 at the close of New York
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
