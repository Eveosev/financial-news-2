Polish five-year bond yields rose
from a record low after policy maker Andrzej Kazmierczak said
the central bank shouldn’t rush to cut  interest rates .  The yield on notes maturing in April 2017 rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.03 percent as of 5:44
p.m. in Warsaw, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It fell
to a record-low of 4.01 percent on Oct. 19 as economic data and
comments from policy makers signaled the possibility of a rate
cut as early as next month. The zloty was little changed at
4.1047 against the euro today.  Central bankers should keep a “cautious approach to any
rate reduction” as monetary easing elsewhere in  Europe  and in
the U.S., as well as government investments, will help reignite
Polish growth, Kazmierczak said in an interview with Bloomberg
published today. He was among eight policy makers on the 10-
member Monetary Policy Council who voted for a quarter-point
rate increase in May, making  Poland ’s central bank the only one
in the European Union to raise borrowing costs this year.  “We could see the yields trade higher after falling to
record lows last week,”  Marcin Mrowiec , chief economist at Bank
Pekao SA in Warsaw, wrote in an e-mailed comment today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
