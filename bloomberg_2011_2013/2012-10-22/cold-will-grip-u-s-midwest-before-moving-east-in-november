Cold air will grip the Midwest
starting this weekend, pushing low temperatures to the 20s and
30s Fahrenheit (about minus 7 to 2 Celsius) before moving to the
East Coast to greet November.  Chicago’s daily average temperature may fall 13 degrees
below normal by Oct. 29, according to  MDA EarthSat Weather  in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland , and temperatures across the region are
expected to be 8 to 14 degrees lower than normal. Cooler-than-
usual weather in the high-population areas of the East Coast and
Midwest would boost the amount of energy needed to heat homes
and businesses.  “This forecast has turned much colder through the central
and eastern U.S. since Friday,” MDA said in a note to clients.  Temperatures may fall 3 to 5 degrees below normal along the
East Coast, including  New York , Philadelphia and Boston, from
Nov. 1-5, said  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group
LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  October is traditionally the transition point when energy
demand for heating exceeds the amount needed for cooling. The
core of heating demand in the U.S. is November to March, when
natural gas and heating oil needs are highest.  The normal daily average temperature in New York on Oct. 31
is 53 degrees, according to MDA. It is about 50 in Boston; 48 in
Chicago; 35 in Calgary,  Alberta ; 68 in Houston; 59 in Atlanta;
49 in  Seattle ; and 64 in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
