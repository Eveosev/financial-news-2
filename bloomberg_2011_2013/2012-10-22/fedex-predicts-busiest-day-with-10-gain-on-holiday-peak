FedEx Corp. (FDX)  projected a 13 percent
gain in shipments during the peak season between the U.S.
Thanksgiving holiday and Christmas, driven by less-expensive
services that are popular with online retailers.  Deliveries in the period may top 280 million, the company
said today in a statement. Business-to-consumer shipments such
as online purchases during the holidays have become increasingly
important to FedEx as a slowing economy hurts the market for
high-value overnight shipments between companies.  Cheaper offerings such as SmartPost, where the U.S. Postal
Service makes the final delivery, and ground delivery will lead
FedEx’s gains,  Mike Glenn , executive vice president of market
development, said today. Online merchants use the low-cost
services, then promote free or discounted shipping to entice
consumers to spend more.  “SmartPost fits in the sweet spot of e-commerce,” Glenn
said. “E-tailers like it a lot because it fits well with their
free shipping promotions because it’s a low-cost service.”  FedEx predicted a peak of 19 million shipments on Dec. 10,
which would be a 10 percent gain from last year’s most active
day and the busiest in the  Memphis , Tennessee-based company’s
history.  The projected increases are included in FedEx’s annual
profit forecast, which the company lowered Sept. 18 to no more
than $6.60 a share from a previous range of $6.90 to $7.40.  The  National Retail Federation  forecasts holiday sales, a
signal of economic health, will increase 4.1 percent this year
to $586.1 billion as consumers  “remain conservative.”   FedEx Hiring  FedEx fell 0.7 percent to $91.48 at the close in  New York .
The shares have gained 9.5 percent this year.  While the holiday period is important, expectations are
already set after FedEx lowered its earnings forecast, said  Art Hatfield , an analyst at Raymond James & Associates in Memphis.  “The only way you’ll get meaningful change is if the
economy does materially better or worse than we expect, and
that’s not likely to happen at this point,” Hatfield said.  FedEx plans to hire 20,000 seasonal workers, the same as
last year, to limit costs as it revamps its Express unit to
boost profits by $1.7 billion over three years. The overhaul
includes job reductions and getting rid of fuel-guzzling planes.  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , the world’s largest package-
delivery firm, hasn’t yet provided a holiday forecast.  Last year, FedEx forecast it would handle 260 million
shipments over the peak season, and the actual volume processed
during that period was 247 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
