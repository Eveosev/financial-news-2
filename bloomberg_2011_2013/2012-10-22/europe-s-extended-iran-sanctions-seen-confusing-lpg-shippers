Expanded European sanctions against
 Iran  approved Oct. 15 lack clarity as to whether exporting
liquefied petroleum gas from the country remains legal,
according to  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the largest shipbroker.  Following are comments by Clarkson on the extended
measures, taken from a report published by the shipbroker Oct.
19. Twenty LPG carriers departed the Iranian port of Assaluyeh
since the first European sanctions took effect July 1, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg from IHS Inc., an Englewood,
Colorado-based researcher.  “There has been a notable use of ambiguous wording by
legislators, inspiring little confidence.  “If it is their intention to stem the flow of LPG cargoes
from Iran, then this has not been made clear to those in the
trade. The result is further confusion and more time wasted
consulting with legal and insurance advisors.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
