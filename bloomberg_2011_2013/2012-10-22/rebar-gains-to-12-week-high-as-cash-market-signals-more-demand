Steel reinforcement-bar futures
climbed to close at the highest close in almost 12 weeks as
rising volumes in the spot market boosted the demand outlook.  The contract for May delivery increased 2.2 percent to end
at 3,732  yuan  ($597) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange, the highest close since July 31.  Rebar for immediate
delivery  advanced 0.2 percent to 3,752 yuan a ton today,
according to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Futures rose 0.3 percent last week after economic releases
fueled optimism that a slowdown in  China  was coming to an end.
The economy grew 7.4 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, data showed Oct 18, matching the median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey. Industrial production rebounded from a three-
year low and retail sales and fixed-asset investment accelerated
in September, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  “Both the real-estate sector and infrastructure have shown
some improvement,” said Zhang Jizhou, a trader at Shanghai Flow
Investment Co. “The  spot market  has been enjoying quite an
active sales volume since late September, which has led to a
premium in the spot market over the nearby futures contracts.”  New-home prices in 31 of the 70 cities monitored by the
government climbed in September from a month earlier, the
statistics bureau said Oct. 18.  Iron ore  with 62 percent content delivered to the port of
Tianjin fell 0.2 percent to $115.30 a dry ton on Oct. 19, data
compiled by the Steel Index Ltd. show.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
