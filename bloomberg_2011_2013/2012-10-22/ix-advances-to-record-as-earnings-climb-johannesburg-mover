MiX Telematics Ltd. (MIX)  advanced the
most in seven months to reach a record in Johannesburg trading
after saying earnings per share gained as much as 80 percent in
the six months through September.  Shares in the company, which installs devices used to track
stolen vehicles, rose 21 percent to 2.92 rand in Johannesburg,
the biggest intraday gain since March 19 and the highest price
since its 2007 listing.  The company may have benefited from a turnaround at some of
its operations, Keith McLachlan, a senior equities analyst for
small and mid-cap companies at Thebe Stockbroking in
Johannesburg, said by phone. The weaker rand will probably
result in foreign currency gains from its international
operations, he said.  “This is really a rand hedge,” McLachlan said. “It will
be interesting to see how much of it is simply a translation
from a weaker rand as opposed to how much is organic growth. It
is still a very strong number in light of the environment.”  The company grew revenue from operations outside of  South
Africa  by 31 percent in the year through March, more than a 15
percent advance in total revenue, it said on June 11. Foreign
operations contributed almost half the company’s revenue last
year.  The rand has depreciated 6.1 percent this year, the second-
worst performer of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg
after  Brazil ’s real.  MiX Telematic’s 30-day  historical volatility , a measure of
stock swings, jumped to 70.38 from 42.44 the previous trading
day. The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index’s  30-day volatility 
measure was at 12.23 from 12.38 previously. A higher reading
means the price of an asset can move dramatically in a short
period. About 270,000 shares traded, 119 percent of the average
in the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
