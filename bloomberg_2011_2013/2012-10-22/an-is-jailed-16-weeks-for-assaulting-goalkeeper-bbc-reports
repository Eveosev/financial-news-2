A 21-year-old man was jailed for 16
weeks today for assaulting a goalkeeper at an English soccer
match three days ago, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Aaron Cawley, 21, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire,
admitted assault and entering the field during Sheffield
Wednesday’s home match against Leeds United in the Championship,
the second level of the English game.  Wednesday goalkeeper Chris Kirkland fell to the ground
after Cawley pushed him in the face during the 1-1 draw at
Hillsborough.  Cawley, who appeared at Sheffield Magistrates’ Court, was
also given a five-year soccer banning order. The court heard he
had been drinking heavily and had already broken two previous
orders banning him from games, the  BBC  added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
