Turk Hava Yollari AO, the flag
carrier known as  Turkish Airlines , plans to buy as many as 20
777-300ER wide-body aircraft from  Boeing Co. (BA)  as part of an
effort to expand its transfer traffic in Europe and Asia.  The Istanbul-based carrier will buy the aircraft between
2014 and 2017, including 5 optional purchases, it said today in
a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange . The total list price
is $4.7 billion, Boeing said in a separate statement. Customers
typically buy aircraft at a discount.  Turkish Airlines is stocking up on wide-body jets as it
seeks to lure transfer traffic between Europe and Asia away from
 Air France-KLM Group (AF) , Deutsche Lufthansa AG and British Airways-
parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA. Airlines in
the  Middle East  have benefited from a geographic setting that
links North American and Asian traffic.  The carrier, which has 188 planes in its fleet now, said
Oct. 8 that it will buy 15 A330-300 planes from Airbus SAS.
 Turkish Airlines (THYAO)  has 12 Boeing 777-300ER and 10 A330-300s in its
fleet, according to its  website . The 777 model that Turkish
plans to buy typically seats about 365 passengers in a three-
class layout. It boasts the worldâ€™s largest jet engine.  Turkish Airlines rose 0.5 percent to 4.05 liras at 4:23
p.m. in Istanbul. The stock has surged 77 percent this year,
valuing the company at 4.87 billion liras ($2.7 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
