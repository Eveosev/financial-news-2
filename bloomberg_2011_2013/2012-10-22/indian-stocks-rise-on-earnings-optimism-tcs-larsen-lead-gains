Indian stocks gained after earnings
at some of the country’s biggest companies exceeded estimates,
improving the outlook for corporate profitability.  The BSE  India   Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, increased 0.6
percent to 18,790.11, according to preliminary closing prices at
3:30 p.m. in Mumbai.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest
software exporter, climbed the most since Aug. 28 after second-
quarter profit jumped 44 percent, beating analysts’ forecast.
 Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , India’s biggest builder of power networks
and airports, jumped 2.3 percent after posting a better-than-
estimated 43 percent increase in net income.  Profit at only one out of the eight Sensex firms that have
reported earnings so far for the September quarter has trailed
analyst forecasts, compared with 40 percent of the companies
missing estimates in the June quarter and 30 percent in the
March quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
