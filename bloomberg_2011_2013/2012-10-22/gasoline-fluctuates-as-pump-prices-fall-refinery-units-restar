Gasoline fluctuated on speculation
declining pump prices may stoke demand even as refinery unit
restarts indicate that U.S. stockpiles will rise.  Futures swung between gains and losses as retail prices
fell to the lowest in more than two months.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
and Citgo Petroleum Corp. are starting units following
maintenance at the McKee and Corpus Christi, Texas, refineries.
Futures sank on Oct. 19 to the lowest since July 2.  “After the big selloff on Friday, we did some technical
damage,” said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago . “But the big drop in retail gasoline
prices probably signals plenty of supply moving forward.”  Gasoline for November delivery rose 0.44 cent to $2.707 a
gallon at 9:31 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, after
fluctuating between $2.6825 and $2.72. Prices fell 6.8 percent
last week, the third consecutive weekly decline.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA plans to start a fluid catalytic
cracker at its Pasadena,  Texas , refinery this week, according to
a person with direct knowledge of the situation.  “We should see a big uptick in refinery runs and in
supply,” Flynn said.  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  rose 1.72 million barrels in the
week ended Oct. 12, according to Energy Department data, after
falling 10 of the prior 11 weeks.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, declined
1.1 cents to $3.665 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA, the
nation’s largest motoring organization. That’s the 11th
consecutive day prices sank, and the lowest level since Aug. 8.  November-delivery heating oil gained 0.62 cent to $3.1407 a
gallon on the exchange. Prices declined 2.8 percent last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
