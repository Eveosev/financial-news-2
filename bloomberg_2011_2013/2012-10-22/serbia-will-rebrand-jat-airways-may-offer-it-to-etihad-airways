Serbia plans to turn unprofitable
airline JAT Airways into a debt-free company and possibly offer
it to  Etihad Airways , the third-biggest Gulf airline.  The possible arrangement with Etihad Airways may be worth
$140 million and involve a lease of 12 new aircraft to renew
JAT’s ageing  fleet , Finance and Economy Minister  Mladjan Dinkic 
told reporters at a business forum in Belgrade today.  “We will create a new JAT, we’ll free it from debt” and
try to transform a failed purchase arrangement with Airbus for
new aircraft into a lease agreement, Dinkic said.  The plan emerged after the government rejected JAT’s
request for 35 million euros ($46 million) of sovereign-backed
borrowing, he said. Serbia made an advance payment of about 20
million euros to Airbus SAS more than 10 years ago for the
purchase of eight planes that was later canceled. The government
is now seeking to include the amount in future negotiations.  Renewing JAT’s fleet may cost Serbia about $140 million
“so it would be much cheaper to find a partner,” he said. An
offer to Etihad may also include a new cargo facility in  Serbia 
that can be used for exporting agriculture goods, Dinkic said.  Serbia’s latest attempt to sell JAT Airways failed in
December. The previous government also had plans to split the
airline in two to create a unit with marketable assets and
another with liabilities that would be assumed by the state.  To contact the reporters on this story:
