Czech banks tightened corporate
lending in the third quarter and expect demand for credit to
decline further.  The net percentage of banks reporting stricter collateral
requirements for clients rose to 20 percent of the credit market
from 14 percent in the previous quarter, according to a central
bank  survey  released today. The indicator is calculated by
taking the difference between the percentage share of loans
provided by banks reporting tighter standards and those saying
requirements have eased.  Czech banks, mostly units of foreign lenders such as  Erste
Group Bank AG (EBS)  or  Societe Generale SA (GLE) , are tightening collateral
requirements and raising the interest-rate premium for clients
because the economy has remained in recession since the last
quarter of 2011. The development mars efforts by the central
bank to spur lending. In September the bank cut the benchmark
two-week  rate  to a record low of 0.25 percent.  “The tightening was mainly due to perceptions of the risks
relating to expected general economic activity and manifested
itself during the approval of loans chiefly via a higher
collateral requirement for corporate loans and a rise in
margins,” Prague-based Ceska Narodni Banka said.  Banks expect a further tightening of credit standards as
well as a continuing decline in loan demand, the bank said.  Credit requirements for  mortgage loans  were also tighter in
the third quarter, while demand has fallen, the central bank
said. Standards for  consumer credit  were unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
