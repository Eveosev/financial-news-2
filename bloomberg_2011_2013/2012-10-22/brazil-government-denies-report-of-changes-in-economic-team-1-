Brazil denied a Correio Braziliense
report that the government is considering leadership changes at
the central bank and  Finance Ministry .  The newspaper article is “baseless,” according to an e-
mailed statement from the presidency’s social communications
secretariat today.  Correio Braziliense reported today that some officials are
pushing for a revamp of the government’s economic team, with
central bank President Alexandre Tombini the most likely person
to replace Finance Minister  Guido Mantega . Tombini would
probably be replaced by central bank director Luiz Awazu Pereira, the Brasilia-based newspaper said, without saying where
it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
