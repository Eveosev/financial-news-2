Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland
President Sandra Pianalto said the central bank is working with
lenders to create a faster and more efficient U.S. payment
processing system.  “We will place greater emphasis on improving the
efficiency of payments from end to end -- that is from the
initiator to the ultimate receiver of the payment,” Pianalto
said today in remarks prepared for delivery at a  conference  on
the U.S. payments system at the Chicago Fed. “We will engage
and collaborate with payments industry partners like you to
ensure that we fully understand the needs of the industry.”  The Fed is working toward those goals by expanding its
research capability and working more closely with the industry
to build the best system for banks, consumers, businesses and
governments, Pianalto said. She didn’t discuss monetary policy
or the economic outlook.  Pianalto, 58, votes this year on the central bank’s policy-
setting Federal Open Market Committee. She first joined the
Cleveland Fed in 1983 as an economist in the research department
and has been president since 2003, making her the longest-
serving of all 12 regional bank presidents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
