OAO MegaFon (MFON) , the Russian wireless
carrier planning an initial public offering, postponed its IPO
marketing campaign the day it was supposed to begin, raising
investor speculation that demand may have trailed expectations.  Potential investors had prepared to attend a MegaFon event
in Moscow today, only to learn this morning that it had been
canceled, said Yuri Morogov, a portfolio manager at Troika Asset
Management in the city. MegaFon said in a filing today it will
proceed with marketing “at a later date,” after including
recent acquisitions and third-quarter results in the prospectus.  The delay signals demand hasn’t been as strong as MegaFon
expected, said Alexander Golovtsov, who helps manage $2.8
billion at UralSib Asset Management in Moscow. MegaFon is
seeking to sell as much as 20 percent of its stock, including
shares owned by Sweden’s  TeliaSonera AB (TLSN)  and some from the
carrier itself, in an IPO that may become one of the largest by
a Russian company.  “I think MegaFon named ’amending prospectus’ just as an
excuse for postponing the IPO,” Golovtsov said. “The real
reason may be insignificant demand, which implied a more than 10
percent discount to  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MTSS) ,” he said, referring
to MegaFon’s larger competitor.  In its filing today, MegaFon said “investor engagement in
the investor education process has been exceptionally strong.”  Roadshow Start  “MegaFon management was scheduled to meet investment funds
at 1 p.m. in Moscow today starting the roadshow,” said Morogov
of Troika, which manages $2.6 billion of assets. “I came to the
office and learned it’d been canceled.”  The carrier is determined to complete the IPO before year-
end, with the delay postponing the planned sale by a few weeks,
according to two people familiar with the matter. The shares may
start trading in late November or December, they said.  MegaFon, based in Moscow, agreed to buy 25 percent of
Russian handset retailer  Euroset  this month and secured an
option to buy another 25 percent from billionaire  Alisher
Usmanov  as soon as one year from now. The combined 50 percent
stake is valued at $1.33 billion, the company said. Usmanov
controls MegaFon.  The banks managing MegaFon’s IPO valued the company at $12
billion to $16 billion, while investors see value at up to $11
billion, people familiar with the matter said last week.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Russia’s  OAO Sberbank CIB (SBER)  are managing
MegaFon’s share sale, with help from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  VTB Capital (VTBR) , the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
