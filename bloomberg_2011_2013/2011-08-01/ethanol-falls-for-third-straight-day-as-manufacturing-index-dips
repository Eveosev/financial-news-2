Ethanol futures fell a third day in
 Chicago  to the lowest price in more than two weeks as U.S.
manufacturing slowed to the lowest level since July 2009,
threatening fuel demand.  The biofuel extended its longest slump since June 27 after
the Institute for Supply Management’s factory index slumped to
50.9 in July from 55.3 a month earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based
group said today. Ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., is
blended with gasoline to boost supply.  “There could be some sort of selloff,” said  Dan Flynn , a
trader at PFGBest in Chicago. “The manufacturing report put
some pressure on the ethanol market.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 5.1 cents, or
1.8 percent, to settle at $2.84 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures have gained 19 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in Chicago lost 12.5 cents,
or 4.2 percent, to $2.875 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive slipped 7 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.975, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast tumbled 5 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $3.025 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel dropped 4.5
cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.985.  Crude for September delivery fell 81 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $94.89 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
lowest settlement price since June 29. Prices are up 20 percent
over the past year.  Gasoline for September delivery slid 0.39 cent to $3.054 a
gallon in New York. The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  On a spot basis, an average ethanol mill in  Iowa  is making
8 cents on every gallon of the fuel, while a typical plant in
 Illinois  is pocketing 18 cents, according to Ag TraderTalk, a
Clive, Iowa-based online grains information service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
