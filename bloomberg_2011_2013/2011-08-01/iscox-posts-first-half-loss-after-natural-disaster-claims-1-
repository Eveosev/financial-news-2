Hiscox Ltd. (HSX) , the second-biggest
Lloyd’s of London insurer by market value, swung into a loss in
the first half after record claims from natural disasters in
 Japan  and U.S.  The firm had a net loss of 87 million pounds ($143 million)
in the first six months of the year, compared with a profit of
78.6 million pounds in the year-earlier period, the Hamilton,
Bermuda-based insurer said in a statement today.  Hiscox, like other Lloyd’s insurers such Beazley Plc, was
hurt by Japan’s biggest earthquake on record as well as
tornadoes in the U.S. earlier this year. The net cost of the
U.S. tornadoes will be about 35 million pounds and losses from
the Japanese earthquake will be between $60 million and $150
million, Hiscox said in June.  “It has been an exceptionally challenging first half,”
Chairman Robert Hiscox said in the statement. “2011 is reported
to be the most expensive catastrophe year to the  insurance
industry  on record after just six months, worse than the full 12
months of 2005, the previous highest on record.”  The insurer said whether it can turn the loss into a profit
for the full-year will depend on the nature of the  hurricane
season  in the rest of 2011.  “We are quite positive on the second half, but it will all
depends on how many hurricanes there are,” Chief Executive
Officer Bronek Masojada said in a telephone interview today.  The stock rose 1.2 percent to 412.5 pence as of 9:05 a.m.
in London trading, valuing the firm at about 1.6 billion pounds.
Hiscox increased its first-half dividend to 5.1 pence a share,
from 5 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
