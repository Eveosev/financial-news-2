The cost of protecting European
corporate bonds from default fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 15.5
basis points to 577, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 7:30
a.m. in London. The index is a benchmark for the cost of
protecting bonds against default and a decline signals improved
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 3.25 basis points to 138.5 basis
points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers dropped 5 basis points to 212 and the
subordinated index was down 10 at 367.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
