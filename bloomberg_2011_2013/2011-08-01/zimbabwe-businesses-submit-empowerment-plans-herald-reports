About 700 foreign and white-owned
companies in Zimbabwe have outlined plans to the government
showing how they will cede or sell 51 percent of their companies
to black Zimbabweans or the state, the  Herald  said, citing
Saviour Kasukuwere, the indigenization minister.  Kasukuwere last month rejected 175 proposals from mining
companies that involved passing 25 percent of their
shareholdings to black Zimbabweans along with increased “social
development credits,” the Harare-based Herald said on its
website. Social development credits include the construction of
hospitals, schools and roads.  The indigenization ministry will now target foreign-owned
banks to ensure they lend to black Zimbabweans, the Herald
added. Standard Bank Group Ltd. of  South Africa ,  Standard
Chartered Plc (STAN)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC)  are among the foreign-owned banks
operating in Zimbabwe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
