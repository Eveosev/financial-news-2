Taiwan ’s dollar snapped a two-day
decline after Congressional leaders approved a plan to raise the
U.S. debt ceiling, boosting demand for riskier assets.  Currencies strengthened and shares rose across  Asia ’s
emerging markets as President  Barack Obama  said leaders of both
parties in the U.S. House and Senate had reached an agreement to
raise the nation’s $14.3 trillion debt limit and cut the federal
deficit before an Aug. 2 deadline. Taiwan’s bonds rose after the
government lowered on July 29 its prediction for economic growth
this year to 5.01 percent from 5.06 percent.  “Looks like the risk of a downgrade for the U.S. has eased
for now,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-based foreign-exchange
trader at the Union Bank of Taiwan. “That boosted demand for
Taiwanese assets.”  Taiwan’s dollar gained 0.2 percent to NT$28.838 against its
U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local time close, according to
Taipei Forex Inc. It reached NT$28.770 earlier, the strongest
level in three trading days.  The revision in the growth outlook came after preliminary
data showed the island’s gross domestic product rose 4.88
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, after
climbing 6.55 percent in the first three months. The government
also reduced its export-growth forecast for 2011 to 15.33
percent from 15.93 percent.  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016 dropped one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.205 percent, prices
from Gretai Securities Market show. That was the biggest decline
in a week.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.390 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
