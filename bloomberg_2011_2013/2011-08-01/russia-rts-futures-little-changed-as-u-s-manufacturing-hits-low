Russia ’s RTS stock-index futures were
little changed as a report that U.S. manufacturing almost
stalled in July offset expectations that the U.S. House of
Representatives may agree to raise the country’s debt ceiling.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September fell less than 0.1 percent to 197,635 yesterday.  Contracts on OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-biggest oil
producer, rose 0.3 percent and those on VTB Group, Russia’s
second-largest lender, dropped 0.1 percent. Futures on OAO
Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer, gained 0.2 percent.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
slumped to 50.9, the lowest since July 2009, from 55.3 a month
earlier, the Tempe, Arizona-based group said today. Figures less
than 50 signal a contraction. The July index was lower than the
most pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  The manufacturing report “was pretty bad, and that’s taken
most risk markets down,” said  Paul Biszko , an emerging-market
strategist at  RBC Capital Markets  in Toronto, said in a phone
interview. “There was initial euphoria about a fiscal agreement
in the U.S., but people realize it’s not a done deal until the
House votes.”  The House planned to vote yesterday on the agreement
reached during a weekend of negotiations that capped a months-
long struggle between President  Barack Obama  and Republicans
over raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling. A failure to raise
the ceiling opens the possibility that the U.S. would be forced
to default.  Crude for September delivery slipped 0.5 percent to $95.20
a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. The euro weakened
1 percent, falling to $1.4257 in New York.  U.S. stocks dropped as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
retreated 0.4 percent. The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  gained 1.2
percent to 1,725.10 in Moscow yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
