America Movil SAB may combine
customer-service operations and sell services together in joint
stores after acquiring full control of Telefonos de Mexico SAB,
Chief Financial Officer Carlos Garcia-Moreno said.  The advantages of owning 100 percent of Telmex are far
greater than owning a majority stake in the company, Garcia-
Moreno said today in a phone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
