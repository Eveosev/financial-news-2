Australian sales of newly built
dwellings fell 8.7 percent in June, the biggest decline in five
years, the Canberra-based Housing Industry Association said in a
report released today.  Detached house sales declined by 8.8 percent and the
apartment sector dropped by 8.1 percent in June, it showed.  “Evidence is mounting that weakness in the new home sector
is accelerating even with  interest rates  on hold,” said Harley
Dale, HIA chief economist, in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
