Walter Rossini, who helps manage $300
million in Indian equities at Aletti Gestielle SGR SpA, comments
on the outlook for the nation’s stocks. He spoke by telephone
from Milan.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index increased 0.6
percent to 18,299.27, according to preliminary closing prices at
3:30 p.m. in  Mumbai , rallying for the first time in five days.
The S&P CNX Nifty Index rose 0.6 percent to 5,513.  On outlook for stocks:  “We would like to add India weightage relative to other
emerging markets in our overall portfolio allocation. We have
started building our positions in Indian equities and would
start investing aggressively in November. By then, we expect
 interest rates  and inflation to peak. We will also be able to
assess the impact of the monsoon and second-quarter earnings by
October-November.”  “We are not looking at sector specific themes as there is
a lot of divergence in performance. Our strategy is to go for
stock specific investments.”  On US debt negotiations:  “The raising of the debt limit may weaken foreign fund
flows into  India  in the short term. We believe this will offer a
better entry opportunity for long term investors.”.  Overseas funds bought a net 4.17 billion rupees ($94.5
million) of Indian equities July 28, raising their investment in
stocks this year to 107 billion rupees, according to data on the
website of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
