The euro may climb to its highest
level versus the dollar this year should it rise above
resistance between $1.4519 and $1.4578, said Pak Lai Ng, a
technical analyst at Forecast Pte in  Singapore .  The $1.4519 level is the 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the 17-nation currency’s decline from this year’s high of
$1.4940 reached on May 4 to a four-month low of $1.3837 marked
on July 12, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The level of
$1.4578 was the currency’s high in July. Daily momentum
indicators such as the moving average convergence/divergence, or
MACD, suggest the euro will rise, according to Ng.  “It needs to break the July 4 high, then the focus will be
back to the May high,” Ng said. “If you look at the overall
long-term picture, it’s still up.”  The euro traded at $1.4257 as of 8:06 a.m. in  Tokyo  from
$1.4250 in  New York  yesterday. The MACD for the euro was 0.0003
today, above the so-called signal line of -0.0003, according to
Bloomberg data. A reading above the signal line indicates the
currency will strengthen.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates it may move
to the next level. Support refers to an areas where buy orders
may clustered. Resistance is where there may be orders to sell.  MACD is a gauge of momentum and is calculated by
subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average from the 12-
day average. The signal line is a nine-day exponential moving
average of the MACD, and provides buy and sell signals.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security, commodity,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
