Zynga Inc., the largest developer of
games on Facebook Inc.’s website, was sued in federal court in
 Delaware  by rival Segan LLC over accusations it infringed a U.S.
patent for viewing network content with products including
“FarmVille” and “Mafia Wars.”  Segan, based in Long Island City,  New York , contends Zynga,
of San Francisco, has knowingly used the invention, patented in
2006, and should be prohibited from infringement after a  jury
trial , according to a July 29 complaint filed in Wilmington.  Segan “has suffered injury and monetary damages” and is
entitled to “a reasonable royalty to compensate” for the
infringement, plaintiff’s lawyers said in court papers.  Zynga has filed for an initial public offering to raise $1
billion, according to a regulatory filing. The company said last
month it is expanding into  China  with a version of
“CityVille,” its most popular game, in Chinese.  Dani Dudeck, a Zynga spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return
an e-mail message seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Segan LLC v. Zynga Inc., 11CV6760, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
