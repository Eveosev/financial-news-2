The Nikkei 225 Stock Average gained
the most in a month after U.S. President  Barack Obama  said
congressional leaders reached an agreement to raise the federal
debt ceiling and avert a default.  Honda Motor Co., which counts  North America  as its biggest
market, increased 1.5 percent as a gain in the dollar boosted
its earnings outlook. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., which
gets 26 percent of its sales in China, gained 2 percent after a
mainland manufacturing index beat estimates.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s biggest publicly traded bank,
climbed 4.1 percent after reporting first-quarter profit tripled.  “Investors who were very concerned about the debt ceiling
negotiations now need to buy back their positions,”  Yoshihiro Okumura , who helps manage the equivalent of $365 million at
Chiba-Gin Asset Management Co. in　 Tokyo . “There had been a lot
of  risk aversion  because a default would have meant that the U.S.
government would lose the ability to stimulate the economy with
public spending.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  rose 1.3 percent to 9,965.01 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, the most since June 29. The broader Topix index
increased 1.2 percent to 851.70, with about four stocks rising
for each that fell. The gauge slid 3.2 percent last week amid
concern that the U.S. would default on its debt if lawmakers
were unable to break a deadlock on raising the federal borrowing
limit by an Aug. 2 deadline.  ‘Default Fears’  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped 1.6 as
congressional leaders reached a bipartisan agreement to raise
the debt ceiling by at least $2.1 trillion, sufficient to serve
the government’s needs into 2013. Republican and Democratic
leaders now have to sell the deal to skeptical members of their
own parties by tomorrow in  Washington .  The House plans to vote today and the Senate may follow suit
to consider the agreement.  “Fears of a partial U.S. government shutdown or default
have been the main worry for investors,” said Sydney-based
 Shane Oliver , head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors Ltd., which has almost $100 billion under management.
“Nervousness is likely to remain high as the deal will still
have to pass both houses of Congress.”  The dollar climbed versus the yen after Obama said that
congress was making progress on a deal. The Dollar Index, which
tracks the currency against six counterparts, fell in July as
debt talks and concern over slow growth damped demand for the
greenback.  China’s Factories  Exporters to the U.S. advanced on speculation a stronger
dollar will help boost income from overseas. Honda Motor climbed
1.5 percent to 3,125 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , Japan’s biggest maker of
industrial robots, advanced 4.6 percent to 15,280 yen.  Kyocera
Corp. (6971) , a maker of solar panels that gets 17 percent of its
revenue in the U.S., gained 1 percent to 8,330 yen.  Hitachi Construction gained 2 percent to 1,776 yen after
the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said the
mainland’s Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 50.7 for July
compared with 50.9 in June. That was higher than every forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of 13 economists. The median estimate was
for a reading of 50.2.  Today’s data may ease concern that Premier Wen Jiabao’s
campaign to tame inflation will trigger a deeper slowdown that
limits  China ’s contribution to global growth. The government
needs to sustain domestic demand as a sluggish U.S. recovery and
a sovereign debt crisis in  Europe  saps export demand.  Earnings Surprises  Stocks also advanced after companies reported positive
earnings. Of the 643 Japanese companies that have released
quarterly earnings results since July 11, 101 have reported
profit surprises, exceeding 63 firms that reported disappointing
results, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “More and more companies are reporting earnings that
exceed analysts’ estimates or raising profit forecasts,” said
 Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Daiwa Securities
Capital Markets Co. in Tokyo. “That’s bringing a feeling of
hope.”  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial advanced 4.1 percent to 408 yen,
the most since March 22. The bank said on July 29 that first-
quarter profit rose to 501 billion yen ($6.5 billion), tripling
from a year earlier. The lender said it had a 291 billion yen
gain related to the conversion of Morgan Stanley preferred
shares into common stock.  Docomo, Denso  NTT DoCoMo rose 1.6 percent to 143,800 yen. The company
said on July 29 that profit increased 12 percent to 158 billion
yen for the April-June period because of cost reductions.  The Nikkei 225 lost 3.9 percent this year through July 29,
compared with a gain of 2.8 percent by the  S&P 500  and a drop of
3.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Japanese benchmark index were valued at 16 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the S&P 500
and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Denso Corp. (6902) , Japan’s biggest car-parts maker, gained 2.9
percent to 2,834 yen after raising its half-year profit forecast
to 9 billion yen from 1 billion yen on a faster-than-expected
recovery from the March 11 earthquake.  Toto Ltd. (5332) , a maker of ceramic fixtures including toilets,
jumped 6.3 percent to 640 yen. The company raised its full-year
net income forecast 18 percent to 13 billion yen, citing a
recovery in domestic demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
