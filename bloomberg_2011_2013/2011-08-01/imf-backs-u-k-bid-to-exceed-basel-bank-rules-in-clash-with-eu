The  International Monetary Fund  said
the U.K. is right to seek the power to exceed minimum capital
standards on banks endorsed by global regulators, siding with
Britain in a clash with the European Union.  The U.K. authorities “are rightly advocating” for
European legislation that “enables the establishment of strong
standards that exceed the Basel III minima,” the IMF said in a
report on the U.K. published in  Washington  today.  Michel Barnier, the EU’s financial-services commissioner,
has clashed with some governments in the 27-nation EU over how
to interpret and implement last year’s deal by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision. Finance ministers including
U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne,  Spain ’s  Elena Salgado  and  Sweden ’s Anders Borg have criticized plans to make
it harder for national regulators to set tougher capital rules
than the accord, known as Basel III.  Barnier last month proposed common rules to put in place
Basel III in the EU, arguing that “core requirements” should
be harmonized to avoid distortions to competition and regulatory
arbitrage.  The proposals would still allow countries  “necessary
flexibility”  to set tougher requirements on a case by case
basis for banks considered to be more at risk, the commissioner
said. EU governments and lawmakers at the European Parliament
must approve draft legislation before it can take effect.  Chantal Hughes, a spokeswoman for the commission, didn’t
immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
