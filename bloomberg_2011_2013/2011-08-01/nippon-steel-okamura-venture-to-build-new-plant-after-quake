Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , Japan’s largest
steelmaker, and  Okamura Corp. (7994)  will jointly invest 2.4 billion
yen ($31 million) in a new plant to make steel office furniture
after the March 11 temblor shut the venture’s current facility.  NS Okamura KK, 46 percent owned by Okamura and 45 percent
held by Tokyo-based Nippon, aims to start production at the new
facility in May, the companies said in a statement today. The
old plant will be closed permanently, they said.  Output at the existing plant in Kamaishi was halted after
the magnitude-9 earthquake hit northeastern Japan. Sales of
steel furniture produced at the new facility, to be located
about 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) west of the old plant, may reach
2.5 billion yen a year, Akio Migita, general manager of Nippon
Steel’s flat-products sales division, said at a media briefing
in  Tokyo  today.  The venture had a loss of about 1 billion yen in the year
ended March 31 after the temblor, Teiichi Toshida, director of
Yokohama-based Okamura, said at the briefing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
