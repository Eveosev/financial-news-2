Vladimir Antonov , a Russian banker
blocked by the European Investment Bank from investing in Saab
Automobile, plans to spend $400 million on gold mining in the
former  Soviet Union ,  Latin America  and Africa over five years.  Finasta, his investment company, may bid for the Dzheruy
gold deposit in Kyrgyzstan with reserves of 2.4 million ounces,
the Vilnius, Lithuania-based business said today. Gold has risen
14 percent in London trading this year to $1,619 an ounce.  Finasta will set up a joint venture by end-2011 to hold the
assets, including some in Russia, taking at least a 50 percent
stake, Dmitry Ponomarev, a board member, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
