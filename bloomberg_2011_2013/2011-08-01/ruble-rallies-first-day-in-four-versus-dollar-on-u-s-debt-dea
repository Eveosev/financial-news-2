The ruble strengthened for the first
day in four against the dollar after U.S. President  Barack Obama 
said Congressional leaders reached an agreement to raise
America’s debt ceiling, spurring confidence in riskier emerging-
market assets.  Russia ’s currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 27.5075 per
dollar as of 10:34 a.m. in Moscow, the first rise since July 26.
The ruble was little changed at 39.64 per euro, leaving it 0.3
percent stronger at 32.9685 versus the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  Leaders of the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties have
agreed on a deal that will “reduce the deficit and avoid
default,” Obama said in an appearance in the White House
briefing room last night. The plan would raise the $14.3
trillion debt ceiling by $2.1 trillion, sufficient to serve the
nation’s needs through 2013.  The agreement in  Washington  will probably spur “a stronger
ruble going into the fourth quarter,” Johannesburg, South
Africa-based Tradition Analytics wrote in an e-mailed note to
clients. “The news offers some short-term relief from the
expectation of a U.S. default, and riskier investment prospects
will now be considered once more.”  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, advanced as the new debt
plan stoked confidence in the economy of the world’s biggest
crude consumer. Crude for September delivery rose 1.5 percent to
$97.12 a barrel in  New York .  Russian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
ruble Eurobond due in 2018 down one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 6.821 percent. Non-deliverable forwards,
which provide a guide to expectations of currency movements and
allow companies to hedge against them, show the ruble at 27.7837
per dollar in three months, compared with 27.8915 on July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
