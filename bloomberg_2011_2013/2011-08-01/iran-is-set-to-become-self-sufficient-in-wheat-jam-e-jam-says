Iran  will become self-sufficient in
wheat production in the nation’s current calendar year,  Jam-e-
Jam  reported, citing Agriculture Minister Sadegh Khalilian.  The country will be able to export as much as 2 million
metric tons of the grain, Khalilian said, according to a report
published July 30 on the Tehran-based newspaper’s website.  “Since last year, the government had planned for a
stockpile of wheat in case of a need in the market,” the
minister said, according to Jam-e-Jam. “However, with demand
being met by local production, there will be no need to resort
to the emergency stockpile.”  Those preparations were in reaction to lower rainfall in
the past autumn, Khalilian said. Iran’s calendar year started
March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
