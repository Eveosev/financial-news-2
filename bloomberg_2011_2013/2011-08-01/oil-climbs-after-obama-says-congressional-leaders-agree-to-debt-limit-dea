Crude oil declined to a one-month low
after a gauge of U.S. manufacturing showed growth at the slowest
pace in two years, a sign the economic expansion is faltering.  Futures dropped for a second day after the Tempe, Arizona-
based  Institute for Supply Management  said its factory index
decreased to 50.9 in July from 55.3 in June. Prices climbed
earlier when President  Barack Obama  said congressional leaders
approved a deal to raise America’s debt ceiling, signaling the
country will avoid a default.  “The agreement may have helped prevent a crash of the
economy in the short term, but there’s still a lot to worry
about,” said  Adam Sieminski , chief energy economist at Deutsche
Bank AG in Washington. “The economy hardly grew in the first
half of the year and the outlook for growth isn’t promising.”  Crude for September delivery fell 81 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $94.89 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
lowest settlement price since June 29. Prices are up 20 percent
over the past year.  The front-month contract also fell below the 200-day moving
average for the first time since July 12, triggering a “broad
selloff,” said  James Williams , an economist at WTRG Economics,
an energy research firm in  London , Arkansas. The moving average
was $94.93 today.  Brent for September settlement gained 7 cents to $116.81 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark contract was at a $21.92 premium to New York
futures, down from a record $22.63 on July 14, based on closing
prices.  ‘Sobering Reminder’  “The initial euphoria over the debt ceiling was overdone,
and the ISM report was a sobering reminder of the problems we
face,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “The S&P turned on the manufacturing
numbers and oil followed.”  The Standard and Poor’s Index declined 0.6 percent to
1,284.78 at 3:04 p.m. in  New York .  The July manufacturing index is lower than the median
estimate of 54.5 in a Bloomberg News survey of 80 economists. A
measure of new orders fell to 49.2, showing the first
contraction since June 2009.  U.S. gross domestic product climbed at a 1.3 percent annual
rate last quarter after expanding 0.4 percent in the first three
months of 2011, the worst performance since the start of the
recovery in June 2009, the Commerce Department said on July 29.  ’A Shocker’  “The ISM manufacturing number is a shocker and it’s backed
up by last week’s GDP number,” said  Richard Ilczyszyn , a
Chicago-based senior market strategist at MF Global. “With the
combination of the bad numbers here, this could be construed as
sustained slow growth.”  Manufacturing in the U.K., Russian and Australia shrank
last month, while the pace of factory growth slowed in  Europe 
and  China , according to surveys today.  In the U.K., a factory gauge by Markit Economics fell to
49.1, the lowest since June 2009, from 51.4, and a measure for
 Russia  slipped to 49.8 from 50.6. Australia’s index slid to a
two-year low of 43.4 from 52.9. Readings below 50 indicate
contraction.  Europe’s index of manufacturing growth cooled to 50.4, the
slowest pace in 22 months, from 52 in June. China’s purchasing
manufacturing index moderated to 50.7 from 50.9, the China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said.  Debt Ceiling  Crude gained after Obama spoke from the White House and
Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  endorsed the emerging accord
between Republican leaders and the administration.  Congressional leaders are sifting through the details of
the tentative bipartisan agreement to raise the debt ceiling,
preparing to sell the deal to skeptical Republicans and
Democrats before possible votes today.  The deal would raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling
through 2012, cut spending by about $1 trillion and call for
enactment of a law shaving another $1.5 trillion from long-term
debt by 2021, or institute punishing reductions across all
government areas, including Medicare and defense programs,
according to congressional officials.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ crude
output rose in July to the highest level since December 2008,
led by gains in  Saudi Arabia  and Angola, according to a
Bloomberg News survey. Production increased 245,000 barrels, or
0.8 percent, to average 29.565 million barrels a day, according
to the survey of  oil companies , producers and analysts.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators raised wagers on
rising oil prices by 5 percent to 191,423 futures and options
combined in the week ended July 26, according to Commodity
Futures Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of Traders
report.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 608,203
contracts as of 2:36 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 472,260
contracts on July 29, 30 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.52 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
