Poland ’s WIG20 Index climbed 17.53,
or 0.6 percent, to 2,743.84 at 1:29 p.m. in Warsaw, heading for
its third straight daily gain.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Grupa Lotos (LTS PW), Poland’s second-biggest oil company,
advanced 3.3 percent to 39.48 zloty. Oil advanced from a two-
week low in  New York  after President Barack Obama said
Congressional leaders approved a deal to raise America’s debt
ceiling, stoking speculation the world’s biggest crude user will
avoid a default.  Multimedia Polska (MMP PW) jumped 2.2 percent to 9.50 zloty
and headed for the highest close since July 12. Majority owners
of the cable-television operator will force a mandatory buyout
of the company’s minority shareholders, it said in a regulatory
filing yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
