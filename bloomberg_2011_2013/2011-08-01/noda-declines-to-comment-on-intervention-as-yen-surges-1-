Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko
Noda  declined to comment on currency intervention amid investor
speculation that authorities would sell the yen to stem its
gains against the dollar.  Speaking to reporters in  Tokyo  today, he was answering a
question about whether the government was willing to intervene.
He also said he is monitoring markets closely and that the yen
is overvalued.  Japanâ€™s currency traded at 77.55 per dollar at 8:48 a.m. in
Tokyo, after appreciating to 76.30 yesterday, the strongest
since it touched a record 76.25 on March 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
