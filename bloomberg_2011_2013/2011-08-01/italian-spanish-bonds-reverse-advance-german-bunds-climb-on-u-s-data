Bunds rose while Italian and Spanish
bonds dropped as an index of U.S. manufacturing fell more than
forecast, fueling concern there will be a slowdown in the
world’s largest economy and boosting demand for safer assets.  German government bond yields slumped to the lowest level
since November amid speculation that the U.S. will lose its top
 credit rating , even after a deal was struck to raise the
nation’s debt ceiling. The  House of Representatives  will vote
today, possibly followed by a Senate vote, one day before the
U.S. has predicted it will run out of cash. The additional yield
investors demand to hold Italian bonds instead of benchmark
bunds rose to a euro-era record.  “Anything globally which signifies weaker global growth is
negative for peripherals and probably supports wider spreads,”
said Steven Mansell, an interest-rate strategist at Citigroup
Inc. in London. “Both  Europe  and the U.S. seem to be mired in
weak growth. This is positive for bunds and not positive for
those countries in Europe which have been struggling with high
deficits and can’t grow their way out of it.”  Ten-year bund yields dropped six basis points to 2.48
percent at 4:22 p.m. in London, after earlier rising six basis
points to 2.59 percent. The 3.25 percent security maturing in
July 2021 rose 0.565, or 5.65 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,422) face
amount, to 106.720. Yields on two-year notes were also five
basis points lower, at 1.11 percent.  Italian, Spanish Spreads  The yield on 10-year Italian bonds rose 14 basis points to
6.01 percent, reversing an earlier decline and approaching the
6.027 percent euro-era record reached on July 18, before the
latest bailout for  Greece  was announced.  The spread, or difference in yield, that investors demand
to hold Italian debt instead of similar-maturity German bunds
widened 20 basis points to 353 basis points, or 3.53 percentage
points, the most since April 1996.  Yields on 10-year Spanish debt climbed 11 basis points to
6.19 percent, after dropping to 5.95 percent before the U.S.
data was released. The Spanish-German yield spread widened to
372 basis points.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory index
fell to 50.9 last month from 55.3 in June, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said today. Economists projected the index would
drop to 54.5, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  ‘Shocking’ Data  “You can call it a shocking number, which definitely
underpins the deteriorating picture of the  U.S. economy ,” said
 Kornelius Purps , a fixed-income strategist at UniCredit SpA in
Munich. “Core markets are well supported and the peripheral
markets in the euro area have little scope to recover in such a
risk-off environment.”  European manufacturing growth weakened for a third month in
July, data today showed, adding to signs that the region’s
economy is losing momentum. A manufacturing gauge based on a
survey of purchasing managers in the euro region fell to 50.4
from 52 in June, the lowest reading since October 2009, when it
was below 50 for a 16th straight month. A number above 50
indicates expansion.  Italian Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi  will address the
nation’s Parliament on Aug. 3, news agency Ansa reported today.
Opposition parties have called on Berlusconi to speak to
Parliament and the nation about the government’s plan to boost
confidence in  Italy ’s ability to finance its debt.  Credit-Default Swaps  Spain  and Italy led an increase in the cost of insuring
European sovereign debt. Credit-default swaps on Spain jumped
nine basis points to 374, approaching the record 385 set last
month, according to CMA. Italy climbed seven to 323, nearing an
all-time high of 331.  Swaps on Greece,  Portugal , Ireland and  Belgium  also rose,
pushing the Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on
15 governments up 5 basis points to 276.  France  auctioned 8.5 billion euro of 84-, 175- and 357-day
bills. The Netherlands sold 2.46 billion euros of three-month
bills at an average yield of 0.9 percent, six-month bills at 1
percent and nine-month bills at 1.105 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors 3 percent this
year, compared with 4.3 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds have lost 0.2
percent, while Italian debt has slipped 3.5 percent and
Portugal’s has declined 22 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
