India ’s government bonds advanced for
a second day on speculation yields near three-year highs will
attract buyers.  Yields eased after the  Securities and Exchange Board of
India  said last week it will auction debt quotas to foreign
funds, enabling them to buy more long-term bonds at an auction
on Aug. 5. Lenders probably have more funds to invest in bonds
as the pace of credit growth has slowed, said Krishnamurthy Harihar, a treasurer at FirstRand Ltd.  “There is a temporary relief rally as yields have risen
fast,” Mumbai-based Harihar said. “Credit growth is also
decelerating due to weakening economic growth.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent bond due April 2021 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 8.43 percent as of
10:21 a.m. in  Mumbai , central bank data show. It touched 8.48
percent last week, the highest level for a benchmark note since
September 2008.  Commercial lending grew 19.3 percent from a year earlier as
of July 15, according to central bank data. That was the slowest
pace since September 2010. Gross domestic product rose 7.8
percent in the three months ended March 31 from a year earlier,
the slowest pace in five quarters, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
