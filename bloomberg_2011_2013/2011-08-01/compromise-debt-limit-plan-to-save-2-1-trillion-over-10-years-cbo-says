A compromise U.S. deficit-reduction
plan announced last night would save $2.1 trillion over the next
10 years, according to the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget
Office . The number is in line with lawmakers’ spending-cut
goals.  The savings would come in two rounds, with $917 billion in
cuts to so-called discretionary spending, the agency said. A
special committee would be charged with finding another $1.5
trillion in cuts, though if it failed to act, there would be
automatic cuts totaling $1.2 trillion. The CBO used the latter
figure in its estimate because those cuts would be guaranteed.  The agreement reached yesterday is designed to clear the
way for an increase in the government’s $14.3 trillion debt
limit that the Treasury Department says is needed by tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
