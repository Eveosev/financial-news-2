The Revolutionary Guards commander
who has been nominated by Iran’s President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
to be the new oil minister is a suitable choice, given his
“strategic” outlook on the  energy industry ,  Press TV  reported,
citing the head of the parliament’s energy committee.  Rostam Qasemi is a “practical person” and “his views on
oil and gas are strategic,” said Hamid-Reza Katouzian, who
heads the committee, according to the state-run news channel’s
website. “He is aware of problems in the oil and gas sectors
and has solutions for them.”  Qasemi heads the Khatam al-Anbiya Construction
Headquarters, the engineering arm of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps. He said last week that he will put development of
oil and gas fields shared by Iran with other nations at the top
of his agenda if he receives a confidence vote from the
parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
