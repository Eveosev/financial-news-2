Air Liquide SA (AI) , the world’s biggest
producer of industrial gases, said first-half profit rose 11
percent as sales climbed and the company reduced spending.  Net income increased to 750 million euros ($1.08 billion)
from 676 million euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company
said today in a statement. That compares with an average
estimate of 744 million euros in a Bloomberg survey of seven
analysts. Sales climbed 9.2 percent to 7.12 billion euros.  Rising earnings “reflect the positive momentum in our
markets” in “an environment that was affected by world events,
notably in  Japan  and the Middle East,” Chief Executive Officer
Benoit Potier said in the statement. He reiterated his forecast
for “steady growth” in net income in 2011.  Potier said in December that annual sales may rise by 8
percent to 10 percent on average through 2015 as the company
boosts investments in  China ,  Russia , the  Middle East  and other
fast-growing regions. The company aims to meet rising demand for
oxygen, hydrogen and other gases used by the oil-and-gas
industry and makers of steel, cars and flat and solar panels, as
well as hospitals and the home-care industry.  Air Liquide’s recurring operating margin was at 16.7
percent of sales in the first half, when it cut costs by 132
million euros, compared to a margin of 16.6 percent a year
earlier.  Investment decisions rose 20 percent to 970 million euros.
Capital expenditure, including acquisitions and asset sales,
amounted to 789 million euros in the January-June period, little
changed from a year earlier.  Net debt fell 2 percent from a year earlier to 5.58 billion
euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
