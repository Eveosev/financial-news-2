The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars advanced as President  Barack Obama  announced that party
leaders had reached an agreement to raise the U.S. debt ceiling,
spurring demand for higher-yielding assets.  The so-called kiwi reached a record against the dollar
after Obama said at the White House that heads of the Democratic
and Republican “parties in both chambers have reached an
agreement that will reduce the deficit and avoid default.” The
Aussie was set for its biggest gain versus the yen since May as
Asian stocks rallied, improving the global outlook for equities.  “It’s good news for risk,” said Roland Randall, a senior
strategist at TD Securities Inc. in  Singapore . “It’s safe to
assume that we’re going to see a risk rally. We’re likely to see
some gains in Aussie and kiwi on the back of this.”  Australia ’s dollar rose to $1.1051 as of 2:14 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0993 in  New York  on July 29, halting a two-day
decline. It jumped 1.5 percent to 86.63 yen, set for the biggest
one-day gain since May 17.  New Zealand’s dollar touched 88.44 U.S. cents, the most
since it was freely floated in 1985, before trading at 88.20
cents from 87.93 cents. It gained to 68.35 yen from 67.54 yen,
after climbing to 68.89 yen, the highest level since May 2010.  Yields on New Zealand’s 10-year debt touched 4.91 percent,
their lowest since March 2009, before moving to 4.94 percent.
Australia’s 10-year yield rose to 4.88 percent from 4.80
percent, the lowest level since August 2010.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of regional shares climbed 1.7
percent. Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in
September rallied 1.5 percent.  Above-Target Inflation  Australia’s currency maintained gains after a report showed
annual inflation accelerated beyond the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia’s target, prompting speculation policy makers will
raise the benchmark rate.  Consumer prices gained 3.2 percent in the year through July
after a 2.9 percent advance in June, according to an index
compiled by TD Securities and the Melbourne Institute released
in Sydney today. The RBA aims to keep inflation in a 2 percent
to 3 percent range on average. Prices rose 0.3 percent from a
month earlier after no change in June.  “They’ve got to be forward looking,” said Alex Sinton,
Auckland-based senior dealer at ANZ National Bank Ltd., which
forecasts the RBA will raise borrowing costs by 25 basis points
to 5 percent at a meeting tomorrow. “They really don’t have an
awful lot of leeway in their inflation mandate. If it’s not this
meeting, they might be just getting a little bit behind the
eight ball and the RBA is not really known for being behind.”  Swaps traders scaled back wagers on  interest-rate  cuts and
are betting the  Reserve Bank of Australia  will slash its key
rate by 14 basis points over the next 12 months, a Credit Suisse
AG index showed today. That compares with a 42-basis-point
decrease projected on July 25.  Central bank governor  Glenn Stevens  will keep the benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent for an eighth meeting
tomorrow, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
