The  Philippine peso  gained the most
in three months and  government bonds  rose on speculation a
decline in the  budget deficit  will prompt overseas investors to
add to their holdings of the nation’s assets.  June’s deficit may be less than half of the level a year
earlier, Budget Undersecretary Laura Pascua said today. The
shortfall was 34.6 billion pesos ($825 million) in June 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
expects capital inflows to continue, boosted by loose monetary
policy in other economies, Governor Amando Tetangco said today.  “With that kind of news, the flows will continue to be in
our favor,” said Marcelo Ayes, senior vice president at Rizal
Commercial Banking Corp. in  Manila . “Clearly, the government is
making progress on its fiscal consolidation plan. That will also
lessen the supply of debt.”  The peso climbed 0.5 percent to 41.925 per dollar as of the
4 p.m. close in Manila, the biggest gain since April 28,
according to Tullett Prebon Plc.  The government is targeting a shortfall of 2.6 percent of
gross domestic product, or about 286 billion pesos in 2012,
compared with 3 percent, or about 300 billion pesos, this year.  President  Benigno Aquino  “expressed some concern” on the
strengthening peso to his economic managers last week, his
spokesman Ricky Carandang said today.  The yield on the 5.875 percent notes due December 2020 slid
10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to 6 percent,
according to ICAP Plc.  To contact the reporter for this story:
