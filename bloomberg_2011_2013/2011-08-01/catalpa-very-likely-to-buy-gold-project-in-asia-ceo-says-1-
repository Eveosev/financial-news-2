Catalpa Resources Ltd. (CAH) , an Australian
gold producer, plans to buy a gold project in Asia after
“bedding down” a merger with Conquest Mining Ltd.  Catalpa is “very likely” to pursue a project with output
capacity of 100,000 to 200,000 ounces a year, after integrating
Conquest Mining and bringing two further gold Australian
ventures into production, Chief Executive Officer Bruce McFadzean said in an interview in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.  The Perth-based company is among gold producers seeking to
expand as prices for the precious metal soar. Catalpa agreed in
June to buy Conquest for A$297 million ($328 million) in stock
and purchase two gold projects from Newcrest Mining Ltd., giving
it four producing mines in  Australia .  Catalpa plans to produce 400,000 to 450,000 ounces a year
starting in 2013 as it adds output from the two new projects.
The stock was unchanged at A$1.555 at the 4:10 p.m. close in
Sydney, and has fallen 21 percent this year.  Gold has jumped 37 percent in the past 12 months in London
trading, reaching a record $1,632.80 an ounce July 29. Natixis
Commodity Markets Ltd. raised its 2012 gold price estimate to
$1,300 from $1,140 on July 28 as the debt crisis in  Europe  and
the U.S. spurs demand for the metal as a protection of wealth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
