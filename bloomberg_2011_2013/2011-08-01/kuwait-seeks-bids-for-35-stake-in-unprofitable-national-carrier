Kuwait is seeking bids to sell 35
percent of Kuwait Airways Corp. as the OPEC oil producer
searches for strategic investors to return the national flag
carrier to profit.  “All identified assets, liabilities, rights and benefits”
of Kuwait Airways Corp. will be transferred to a new company
called Kuwait Airways Co. KSC, the Privatization Committee said
in an e-mailed statement today. Joint-stock companies listed on
the Kuwait Stock Exchange and specialized global companies can
subscribe to 35 percent of the share capital valued at 220
million dinars ($804 million), it said.  Kuwait’s parliament in January 2008 decided to sell shares
in the airline, which hasn’t had a profit since the 1990 Iraqi
invasion. The government planned to offer 40 percent of the
stock to the public, 35 percent to a strategic investor and 5
percent to employees, and keep the remainder.  Kuwait Investment Authority , the country’s sovereign wealth
fund, will own 20 percent the new airline company, while Kuwait-
based airline operators won’t be eligible to bid for the stake,
according to the statement. The Privatization Committee didn’t
provide details of selling shares to the public.  Citigroup Inc. and Ernst & Young were chosen to carry out
the privatization, state-run Kuwait News Agency reported in
August last year. The carrier operates 17 aircraft including two
Boeing 777s and a mixed fleet of Airbus A340s, A310s, A320s and
A300-600s.  The deadline for submission of expressions of interest for
the 35 percent stake is 5 p.m. Kuwait time on Aug. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
