Ford Motor Co. (F)  said it’s reducing the
price of its in-car communication system to boost sales of the
option that lets drivers make hands-free calls as more states
ban the use of cell phones while operating a vehicle.  The Sync system’s price will drop to $295 on 2012 Ford
models, $100 less than the option’s cost on current model year
vehicles, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said today in a
statement. The 2012 Edge crossover and 2012 Explorer will be
first to offer Sync at the lower price, Ford said.  Ford has said the Sync system, available on almost all
models, is an important consideration in 50 percent of
purchases. The company has sold more than 3 million vehicles
with the system, which allows voice-activated control of the
car’s music player, hands-free calls and an automated emergency
calling service.  The second-biggest U.S. carmaker said it supports proposed
legislation for a U.S. ban on the use of hand-held phones while
driving. Ten states, including California and  New York , already
ban hand-held phone use while driving and 34 states don’t permit
drivers to send  text messages  while operating a vehicle, Ford
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
