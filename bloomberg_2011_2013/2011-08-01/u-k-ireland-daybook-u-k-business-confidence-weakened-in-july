U.K. business confidence weakened
last month after reaching a 13-month high in June, adding to
indications that growth may be slow for the rest of the year.  The Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets Business barometer survey
showed a net positive balance of 19 percent of companies that
were more optimistic about the economy, down from June’s 36
percent.  WHAT TO WATCH:  *HSBC may announce plans to eliminate 10,000 jobs when it
