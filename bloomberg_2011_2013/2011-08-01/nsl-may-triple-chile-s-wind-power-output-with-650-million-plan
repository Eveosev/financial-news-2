NSL Group, the parent of India’s
fifth-largest wind-turbine maker, plans to invest $650 million
in a wind power project in  Chile  that would triple the South
American nation’s capacity.  NSL has acquired the rights to develop 400 megawatts of
wind farms across five adjacent sites, the Hyderabad-based group
said in an e-mailed response to questions. It expects to invest
the funds over three years.  The project would be one of the largest in  Latin America 
and “would act as a springboard to capitalize” on other
opportunities in the region, NSL Chairman Mandava Prabhakar Rao
said in the e-mail.  Electricity prices in Chile, which has 172 megawatts of
installed wind capacity, have almost tripled since 2005 because
of a power shortage, according to the Global Wind Energy
Council. Favorable renewable-energy policies and economic
stability make the country favorable for investment, Rao said.  NSL declined to identify the project site or say how much
it paid for the development rights. The group owns Regen
Powertech Pvt.,  India ’s fifth-largest wind-turbine maker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
