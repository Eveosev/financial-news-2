Uganda ’s shilling fell to the lowest
in more than a month against the dollar as companies bought the
U.S. currency to finance their operations against reduced
inflows of the greenback.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
depreciated 1.1 percent to 2,651.25 per dollar, the weakest
intraday level since June 30, and traded 0.9 percent down at
2,646 by 11.32 a.m. in the capital, Kampala.  “It is the beginning of the month and corporate buyers are
in the market to finance their strategies,” Ahmed Kalule, a
currency trader at Bank of Africa Uganda Ltd., said by phone
from Kampala. “The shilling shouldn’t have touched these levels
if we had good inflows.”  The shilling, which reached the weakest level since at
least 1993 on June 30, has depreciated 4.5 percent against the
dollar in the last month, making it the world’s worst performer
in the period. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed inflation
to a more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent in July from 15.7
percent in June, the central bank said on July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
