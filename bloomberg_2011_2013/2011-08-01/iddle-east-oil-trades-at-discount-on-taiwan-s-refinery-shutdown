Middle East oil for sale to  Asia 
traded at discounts on concern that the shutdown of a refinery
in  Taiwan  may lead to extra supply on the market.  Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., stayed at
13 cents a barrel below its official selling price, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg News. Qatar Marine remained at a
discount of 18 cents a barrel to its official selling price,
Bloomberg data showed.  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. has declared a force majeure on
oil-product exports from its 540,000 barrel-a-day refinery in
Mailiao, Taiwan, after it shut because of a fire on July 30. The
company may be forced to delay some imports of crude, Lin Keh- yen, a spokesman, said in an interview today.  Oman crude for immediate loading climbed $2.02, or 1.8
percent, to $113.57 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September rose 1.8 percent to $113.11. Murban
increased 1.8 percent to $117.36.  Oman futures for October delivery rose $1.25 to $112.55 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:26 p.m. Singapore
time, with 978 contracts traded. The settlement price was $113
at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The September Brent-Dubai EFS widened 49 cents to $5.97 a
barrel, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a
London-based broker. The exchange for swaps for October gained
34 cents to $5.45.  To contact the reporter on this story:
