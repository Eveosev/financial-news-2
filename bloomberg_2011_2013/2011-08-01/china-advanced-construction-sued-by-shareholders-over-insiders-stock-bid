China Advanced Construction Materials
Group Inc. (CADC) , a provider of concrete for large-scale projects, was
sued by investors who say they will be shortchanged in a planned
$2.65-a-share buyout by company insiders.  The company is poised for growth and directors are duty-
bound to get the best possible price for shareholders, trustees
for the Morris B. and Mary N. Kinder Living Trust contend in a
Delaware Chancery Court lawsuit filed July 29 in Wilmington.  Stockholders “deserve to receive the maximum value for
their shares through the proposed transaction,” the stock may
be worth as much as $5 a share and a judge should stop the
proposed buyout, the trustees said in court papers.  China ACM said last month that Chairman Xianfu Han and Vice
Chairman Weili He, with more than 49 percent of the stock, had
offered to buy the remaining shares at a 15 percent premium. The
Beijing-based company reported $93 million in revenue last
fiscal year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company has established a special committee to evaluate
the proposal, it said in a July 28 statement.  John Shaw, a company spokesman in  Los Angeles , said he
hadn’t seen the lawsuit and couldn’t immediately comment.  China ACM, a Delaware corporation, fell 5 cents to $2.13 on
July 29 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined
54 percent this year.  The case is Kinder v. China Advanced Construction Materials
Group Inc., CA6729, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
