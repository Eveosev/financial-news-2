South Korea , the world’s fifth-
largest crude importer, increased imports of the fuel by 13
percent last month to help meet summer demand for oil products
in the region.  Imports rose to 77.7 million barrels from 69 million
barrels a year earlier, the biggest gain since March, the
 Ministry  of Knowledge Economy said in an e-mailed statement
today. South Korea’s crude import bill increased 68 percent to
$8.68 billion after benchmark Dubai prices rose 52 percent to
$110.20 a barrel, the ministry also said.  South Korea’s oil-product exports to  Japan  and other Asian
countries increased 27 percent last month to 35 million barrels.
Fuel shipments to Japan expanded the most among all export
destinations, more than doubling from a year earlier, the
ministry said, citing volumes for the first 20 days of July.  The  Association of Southeast Asian Nations  and  China  were
the second- and third-largest buyers by volume, respectively,
according to the ministry.  Oil-product exports jumped 89 percent by value in July with
petrochemical shipments rising 41 percent, the ministry said.  Gas import costs climbed 46 percent to $2.1 billion, while
coal costs gained 21 percent to $1.59 billion, according to the
ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
