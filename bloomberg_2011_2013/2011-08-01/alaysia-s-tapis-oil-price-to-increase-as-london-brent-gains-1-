Malaysia’s official selling price for
Tapis crude, a benchmark contract in the Asia-Pacific region, is
set to rise for the first time in three months, reflecting a
rebound in London-traded Brent futures.  The low-sulfur, or sweet, crude will be set at $123.38 a
barrel for July, up 1.2 percent from June, according to a
Bloomberg News calculation based on a trade formula. State-owned
Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, will announce the price
today, said a company official who asked not to be identified
because of internal rules.  Brent crude futures climbed 3.8 percent in July, snapping a
two-month losing streak, as concern over the  U.S. economy 
bolstered the investment appeal of commodities. The contract for
September settlement on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange traded
above $118 a barrel today.  The Tapis formula comprises a price-adjustment factor set
by Petronas plus the full-month average of dated Brent
assessments from Platts. The North Sea marker, also of a sweet
variety, is a benchmark crude used in Europe, the Mediterranean
and  Africa .  Kuala Lumpur-based Petronas sells its Labuan and Miri Light
grades at the same price as Tapis, while Bintulu and Dulang are
shipped for 30 cents a barrel less.  To contact the reporter on this story:
