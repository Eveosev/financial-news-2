What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after President  Barack
Obama  said congressional leaders reached an agreement to raise
Americaâ€™s debt ceiling, boosting the prospects for economic
growth and commodity demand, Greg Grow, the director of
agribusiness for Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said
in a telephone interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 10 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago as the agreement to raise the U.S. debt ceiling will
revive investor confidence, lifting demand for the oilseed, Grow
said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open up 0.5 cent to
0.75 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may open $3 to $4
higher for 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 8 cents to 12 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that the U.S. deal to avoid a
default will boost consumer and investor demand, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
