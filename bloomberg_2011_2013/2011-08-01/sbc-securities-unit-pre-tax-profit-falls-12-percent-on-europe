HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank by market value, said profit at its global banking and
markets division fell 12 percent, hurt by its fixed income
business in Europe.  Profit before tax in the securities unit fell to $4.81
billion in the six months to June 30 from $5.45 billion in the
same period of last year, HSBC said in an e-mailed statement
today.  “Revenues in credit were also affected by the re-emergence
of uncertainty in the eurozone sovereign credit markets in the
second quarter of 2011,” the bank said in a statement today.  The bank joins Credit Suisse Group AG and  UBS AG (UBSN)  in
reporting lower investment bank earnings. UBS, Switzerland’s
largest bank, scrapped its profit target for 2014 and announced
cost cuts last month after second-quarter net income dropped 49
percent following a slump in earnings at the investment bank.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  also said last week that second-
quarter profit fell 52 percent on lower earnings from its
investment bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
