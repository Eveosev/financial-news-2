Nigeria ’s naira depreciated the most
since March after the central bank lifted curbs on dollar sales
to foreign-exchange bureaus.  The currency of sub-Saharan Africa’s second biggest economy
weakened 1.4 percent against the dollar to 155.95, the biggest
decline since March 10 on a closing basis, at 5:45 p.m. in
Lagos.  Foreign-exchange bureaus increased dollar purchases after
Nigeria’s central bank said on Aug. 19 it removed a $1 million
cap on the amount of foreign exchange that bureaus may buy from
lenders per week, according to Afrinvest, a Lagos-based
brokerage.  Nigeria sold $400 million at a foreign-exchange auction
today, less than the $562 million demanded by lenders, the
Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said in an e-mailed
statement. The marginal rate, which is also used as the
prevailing exchange rate, was 151.85 naira, compared with 151.35
naira at the previous auction on Aug. 17.  Nigeria’s external reserves stood at $34.58 billion as at
Aug. 18, compared with $37.99 billion a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
