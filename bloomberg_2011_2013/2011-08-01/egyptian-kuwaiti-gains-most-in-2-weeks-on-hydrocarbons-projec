Egyptian Kuwaiti Holding Co. (EKHO) , a
Cairo-based private-equity firm, rose the most in more than two
weeks after agreeing with partners to set up Egyptian
Hydrocarbon Co.  The shares gained 2.5 percent, the biggest intraday advance
since July 17, to $1.25 at 12 p.m. in Cairo. That gave Egyptian
Kuwaiti Holding a market value to $1.05 billion. The benchmark
EGX30 Index advanced 0.9 percent.  Egypt Kuwaiti, Tri-Ocean Energy, Saudi Economic Development
Co. and Hayel Saeed Anam Group agreed to start a 2.7 billion
Egyptian pound ($453 million) project that will produce ammonium
nitrate and nitric acid in the countryâ€™s eastern province of
Suez. The companies established Egyptian Hydrocarbon with a
capital of $150 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
