Tokyo  Electric Power Co. said the
water temperature in a spent fuel pool of the No. 4 reactor at
its crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station dropped after
starting a cooling system yesterday.  Water temperature in the pool fell to 63 degrees Celsius
(145.4 degrees Fahrenheit) as of 8 a.m. today after the utility
began a test run of the system, Junichi Matsumoto, a general
manager at the utility, told reporters in Tokyo today. The
temperature was 86 degrees Celsius when Tokyo Electric started
it yesterday, according to a  statement  on its website.  The utility known as Tepco began running a circulating
cooling system on the No. 2 and No. 3 spent fuel pools in May
and June after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami knocked out
 power lines  and backup generators, leading to the failure of
cooling systems at the station. Tokyo-based Tepco plans to
operate a similar cooling system at the No. 1 spent fuel pool
early this month.  The cooling system at the fuel pool of the No. 4 reactor
“is running well,” Matsumoto said. The water temperature of
the pool at the No. 4 reactor may fall to about 40 degrees
Celsius in a few days, Matsumoto said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
