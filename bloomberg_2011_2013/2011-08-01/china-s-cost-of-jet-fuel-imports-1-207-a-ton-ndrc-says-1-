China’s cost of importing jet fuel
will reach 7,768 yuan ($1,207) a metric ton in August, according
to the National Development and Reform Commission.  The NDRC is set to announce domestic ex-factory jet-
kerosene prices for this month based on the cost of importing
the fuel.  China will price domestic ex-factory jet-kerosene at a
discount to import costs on the first of every month, based on a
pricing mechanism announced by the NDRC in July. Supplies will
be priced against imports from  Singapore ,  Asia ’s biggest oil
trading and storage center, spanning a period from the 25th to
the 24th of the following month, including logistics charges and
taxes, according to the NDRC.  The government is adjusting domestic jet fuel prices
monthly as it shifts to a more market-oriented pricing structure
under a five-year plan to spur energy conservation by having
consumers bear a bigger portion of costs.  Chinese energy companies have also called for reforms as
domestic fuel prices remain capped while the cost of importing
crude and oil products climb.  The ex-factory price for No. 3 jet fuel, a Chinese
benchmark, was set at 6,840 yuan a ton as of April, when
domestic oil-product prices were last adjusted.  --Winnie Zhu, Baizhen Chua. Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
