Oil options volatility declined as
underlying futures gained after a report that jobless claims
slipped to a four-month low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 44.2 percent as of 2 p.m. in  New
York , down from 53.3 percent yesterday.  Crude for September delivery rose $1.79, or 2.2 percent, to
$84.68 a barrel at 2:12 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The three most active options in electronic trading were
puts, which gain value as futures prices decline.  The most active contract in electronic trading today was
September $80 puts, with 2,404 lots changing hands as of 2:21
p.m. They fell 81 cents to 66 cents a barrel. September $70
puts, the next-most active option, lost 8 cents to 10 cents with
1,893 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  December $80 puts were the most active options traded in
the previous session, with 10,517 lots changing hands. They fell
$1.70 to $6.04. The next-most active options, September $75
puts, declined $1.47 to 55 cents a barrel on volume of 8,644
lots.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
46,688 contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 44,078 lots
and December $80 puts with 41,963.  To contact the reporter on this story:
