OAO Polymetal, the Russian gold and
silver producer, fell for a third day after the metals slid as
U.S. President Barack Obama agreed on a plan to prevent a
default, curbing demand for safe-haven assets.  Its shares declined 0.5 percent to 573.1 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its lowest in almost a week.  Immediate-delivery gold retreated as much as 1.3 percent to
