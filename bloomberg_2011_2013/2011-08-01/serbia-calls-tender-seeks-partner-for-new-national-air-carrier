Serbia opened a tender for investors
to submit offers for a partnership that will result in a new
national air carrier with JAT Airways at its core.  Qualifying bidders need to be either a commercial airlines
or financial investors who have at least a 5 percent exposure of
their investment portfolio to the airlines industry.  Investors also need to have had a consolidated balance
sheet of at least 200 million euros ($287 million) for the
previous financial year and, directly or indirectly, more than
1.5 million passengers in 2010, according to the tender
published today in Belgrade-based newspaper Politika.  The tender, which closes on Sept. 30, is the government’s
third effort to sell JAT Airways, while merger talks with Turk
Hava Yollari AO, the carrier known as  Turkish Airlines , remained
inconclusive.  JAT’s fleet of 10 Boeing 737-300s and four turboprop ATR
72-200s flies to 32 destinations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
