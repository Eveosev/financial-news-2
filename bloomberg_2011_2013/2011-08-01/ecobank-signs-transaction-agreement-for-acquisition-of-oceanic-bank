Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , the
Togolese lender that operates in more than 30 African countries,
agreed to buy  Oceanic Bank International Plc (OCEANIC) , a Lagos-based
lender bailed out by Nigeria’s central bank in 2009.  The agreement “represents an important milestone in the
process of the recapitalization of the bank,” Oceanic CEO John Aboh said in a statement. The combination will create one of
Nigeria’s top three banks, according to Aboh.  Oceanic is one of eight Nigerian banks whose top executives
were fired by the central bank in 2009 over a debt crisis,
partly caused by loans to stock market speculators. The
regulator bailed out the lenders with 620 billion naira ($4
billion) and has given them until Sept. 30 to recapitalize or
risk having their assets sold.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  has given approval for the
transaction under which Oceanic Bank shareholders will receive
Ecobank shares, Aboh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
