Press Release  Magazine continues to expand global reach with the launch of
European and Asian editions  NEW YORK -- Bloomberg Businessweek announced today that it will
expand its reach in Europe and  Asia  with two new regional
editions and raise its rate base from 900,000 to 980,000 in
early 2012. Continuing the momentum of strong growth in ad
revenue, paid circulation, and global coverage, the magazine
will leverage Bloomberg’s reach to deliver advertisers an even
wider, more global, audience and readers more locally-focused
content.  Bloomberg Businessweek has seen a strong pattern of growth since
relaunching in 2010 and the rate base increase and new regional
editions further demonstrate its commitment to continued
investment.  The global edition of Bloomberg Businessweek posted
a 16% increase in advertising pages year-over-year in the first
half of 2011 (according to the Publishers Information Bureau)
and the addition of 37,000 individually paid subscribers in the
second half of 2010, which was up 7% versus the prior year
(according to the Audit Bureau of Circulation). The magazine has
also revitalized local-language editions in Chinese, Thai,
Indonesian, Turkish, Arabic, and a new Polish-language edition
will launch later this year.  “Bloomberg Businessweek has been consistently growing and we’re
building on this strong momentum and reader demand to expand our
audience in the European and Asian markets,” said Bloomberg
Businessweek President Paul Bascobert. “We’re excited to be able
to provide our readers and advertisers with new, regionally-
focused products by tapping into Bloomberg’s incredibly vast
global network of editorial staff. Our ability to raise the rate
base is a strong indicator that our investments in the brand are
paying off.”  The European and Asian editions of Bloomberg Businessweek will
feature content from the global edition of the magazine combined
with some additional regional reporting from more than 800
Bloomberg reporters in  Europe  and 500 in Asia.  About Bloomberg Businessweek  Named one of the most successful and influential magazines of
