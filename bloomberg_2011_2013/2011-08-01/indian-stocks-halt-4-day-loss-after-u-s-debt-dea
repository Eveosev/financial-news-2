Indian stocks advanced for the first
time in five days after U.S. President  Barack Obama  said
lawmakers had agreed a deal on raising the nation’s debt
ceiling, easing concerns a default may slow growth.  Sterlite Industries ( India ) Ltd., the largest copper and
zinc producer, gained 1.1 percent as metal prices advanced.  DLF
Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest developer, rose the most in two weeks.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
209.62, or 1.2 percent, to 18,406.82 at 9:41 a.m. in Mumbai. The
S&P CNX Nifty Index added 1 percent to 5,541.85 and its August
futures traded at 5,547.95. The BSE 200 Index increased 1
percent to 2,280.  Leaders of both parties in the U.S. House and Senate had
approved an agreement to raise the nation’s debt ceiling and cut
the federal deficit, Obama said. Congressional leaders are
sifting through details of the tentative bipartisan agreement to
raise the debt limit one day before the Treasury says it will
run out of cash to pay its bills. Asian stocks climbed, ending
three days of losses.  Sterlite rose 1.1 percent to 161.5 rupees. Copper gained to
near a three-month high on the London Metal Exchange.  DLF gained 2 percent to 235.5 rupees, paring this year’s
loss to 19 percent.  The Sensex has lost 10 percent this year, the second-worst
performer after  Brazil ’s Bovespa among major indexes in the
world’s 10 biggest markets. Companies on the gauge are valued at
14.8 times estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 11
for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Six out of 17 Sensex companies that posted earnings for the
June quarter have lagged behind analyst estimates, compared with
33 percent that did so in the previous three months.  Overseas funds bought a net 4.17 billion rupees ($94.5
million) of Indian equities July 28, raising their investment in
stocks this year to 107 billion rupees, according to data on the
 website  of the  Securities and Exchange Board of India .  To contact the reporters on this story:
