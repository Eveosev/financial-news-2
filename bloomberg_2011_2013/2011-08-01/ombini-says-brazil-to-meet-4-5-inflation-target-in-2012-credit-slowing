Brazil  will succeed in slowing
inflation back to its 4.5 percent target next year as measures
to curb price increases are already working, central bank
President Alexandre Tombini said today.  The central bank’s fight against inflation is being backed
by fiscal policy, and credit expansion has slowed, Tombini told
business leaders in an event in  Belo Horizonte .  “Macroprudential measures over the course of 2011 are
taking effect,” Tombini said. “Credit continues to grow in a
sustainable way, a healthy way, which does not impose
extraordinary risks to financial stability.”  Analysts are skeptical President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
administration will attain the 4.5 percent goal, after the bank
signaled last week it may soon stop raising  interest rates .
Economists raised their 2013 inflation forecast for the first
time, according to a central bank  survey  published today.  The central bank boosted its benchmark lending rate for a
fifth straight meeting July 20, after inflation accelerated to a
six-year high in mid-July. In a statement accompanying the
decision, policy makers withdrew a commitment to raise rates for
a “sufficiently long” period, leading traders to increase bets
that the bank will hold the rate unchanged at 12.50 percent for
the rest of year.  Faster Inflation  Consumer prices will rise 4.51 percent in 2013, compared
with a 4.5 percent forecast in all surveys since 2009, according
to the central bank survey. Analysts also raised their 2012
inflation forecast for a second straight week to 5.30 percent
from 5.28 percent, the survey shows.  “It’s not a good sign,”  Zeina Latif , chief economist at
RBS Securities Inc, said in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo .
“It means more people are expecting inflation above the mid-
point of the target in 2013.”  President Dilma Rousseff told local newspapers last week
the government is seeking a “soft landing” that will bring
inflation back to it 4.5 percent target without halting economic
growth. At the same time, the central bank inflation forecasts
show consumer prices “around” the target only in the first
half of 2013, the minutes of its July meeting show.  The yield on interest rate futures contracts maturing in
January 2012, the most traded in Sao Paulo, fell one basis point
to 12.45 percent at 9:08 a.m. New York time. The real gained 0.1
percent to 1.5471 per  U.S. dollar .  Consumer prices rose 6.75 percent in the year through mid-
July. Economists in today’s survey held their prediction for 12-
month inflation unchanged at 5.4 percent.  Unlike traders, economists still see the central bank
raising the Selic rate once more this year, to 12.75 percent,
according to today’s survey. They lowered their forecast for the
benchmark rate at the end of 2012 to 12.50 percent from a week
earlier forecast of 12.75 percent.  Economists raised their forecast for economic growth to
3.96 percent this year, from 3.94 percent a week earlier, and
left unchanged their call for 4 percent growth in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
