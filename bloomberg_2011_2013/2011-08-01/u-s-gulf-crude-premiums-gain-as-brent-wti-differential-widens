U.S. Gulf oil premiums strengthened
as the discount of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to
Brent widened.  The gap increased 68 cents to $21.72 a barrel as of 12:51
p.m. in  New York . The spread settled at a record high of $22.63
a barrel July 14. When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens
the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West
African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased 65 cents to
$23.10 a barrel at 12:07 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained $1.45 a
barrel to $24.35 over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened $1.15 to $19.15 while Poseidon’s added $1.25 to
$19 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased $1.50 to $18 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to
70 cents below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium gained
$1.25 a barrel to $23.25.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $15.25. Syncrude
is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands 
in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at $18
a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
