The forint slid to its weakest ever
against the Swiss franc, reversing an earlier gain, after a
bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. manufacturing and concern the
U.S. credit rating will be cut drove investors from risk.  The forint tumbled as much as 2.8 percent to 244.408 per
franc and traded 2.1 percent weaker as of 5:07 p.m. in Budapest.
Against the euro, the Hungarian currency traded up 0.2 percent
at 269.18, after earlier strengthening by as much as 1 percent.  Equities tumbled in Europe and America after the  Institute
for Supply Management â€™s factory index fell to 50.9 in July from
55.3 a month earlier. That missed the 54.5 median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists. The Swiss franc strengthened to
records against the dollar, pound and euro as speculation U.S.
rating will be downgraded stoked demand for the haven currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
