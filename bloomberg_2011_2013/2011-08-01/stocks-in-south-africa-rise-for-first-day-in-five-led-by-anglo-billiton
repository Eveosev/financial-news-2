The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
snapped four days of losses, gaining 49.27 points, or 0.2
percent, to 31,257.31 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The
index fell 2.1 percent in July.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of the benchmark  stock index , closed at
its lowest in more than a month, retreating 2.76 rand, or 0.9
percent, to 317.25 rand. Copper fell in  New York  after
manufacturing slowed more than economists estimated in the U.S.,
the world’s second-biggest user of the metal.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, fell for a sixth day, declining 2.31 rand, or 0.9
percent, to 248.20 rand. A strike at the company’s Escondida
copper mine in northern  Chile  entered an 11th day as workers

to South African power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., advanced
the most in almost two weeks, adding 6.01 rand, or 3.3 percent,

return to work after producers agreed to pay increases of as

commercial bank, rose the most in more than five weeks, gaining
2 rand, or 1.4 percent, to 142.50 rand. The bank forecast it

fuel from coal, gained for the first time in a week, adding 4.40
rand, or 1.3 percent, to 340.30 rand. Oil rose as much as 3
percent to $98.60 a barrel after an agreement to raise the

be sustained and support demand for fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
