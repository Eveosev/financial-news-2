U.S. stocks trimmed declines and the
Dollar Index retreated from its high for the session as
lawmakers predicted a debt-limit agreement will be approved in
Congress.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.4 percent to
1,286.96 at 3:28 p.m. in  New York  after slumping as much as 1.4
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down 20.06
points, or 0.2 percent, at 12,123.18 after sliding 145 points.
The Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against six major
peers, rose 0.5 percent to 74.260 after climbing as much as 0.9
percent earlier.  Republican leaders and the Obama administration voiced
optimism that Congress will pass a compromise plan to raise the
U.S. debt limit by at least $2.1 trillion and slash federal
spending by $2.4 trillion or more. The House plans to vote today
on the agreement. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said a
Senate vote “could happen either tonight or tomorrow.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
