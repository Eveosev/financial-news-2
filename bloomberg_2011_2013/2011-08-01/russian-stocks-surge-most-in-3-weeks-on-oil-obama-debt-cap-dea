Russian stocks rose by the most in
more than a week as oil gained after President  Barack Obama  said
U.S. lawmakers have reached agreement on raising the nation’s
debt limit to avoid a default.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks climbed 1.2 percent to 1,725.1
by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest advance since July
21. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil producer, rallied 1.5
percent. OAO Novatek, the country’s second-biggest natural gas
producer, added 3.9 percent. OAO Sberbank, the country’s largest
lender, increased 1.3 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
climbed 1.1 percent to 1,985.78.  Obama said yesterday leaders of both parties in the House
and Senate reached an agreement to raise the debt limit as well
as cut the federal deficit. Oil, Russia’s main export revenue
earner, rose from a two-week low, adding as much as $2.73 to
$98.43 a barrel in  New York , before trading little changed by
the close of trading in Moscow.  “There is a sense of relief that this catastrophe has been
avoided,”  Chris Weafer , head of Russian research at ING Groep
NV, said by telephone from  London . “There should be a relief
rally and additional inflows to Russia now that fears have been
allayed.”  The Micex pared gains of as much as 2.1 percent after a
report showed U.S. manufacturing expanded in July at the slowest
pace in two years, curbing demand for riskier assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
