Brisa-Auto Estradas de  Portugal  SA,
the country’s biggest toll-road operator, dropped to the lowest
level in more than 13 years in Lisbon trading after the company
said 2011 toll revenue in Portugal may miss its target.  Toll revenue at the company’s main concession may miss the
March forecast of a 2 percent to 3 percent gain, Chief Executive
Officer Vasco de Mello said in a phone interview July 29. Brisa
is reducing expenditures and maintaining cash generation to
offset worsened economic prospects, Mello said. Natixis
Securities cut its price target to 3.10 euros from 3.90 euros.  “The company’s outlook is one of the reasons dragging on
the shares,” Pedro Oliveira, a trader at GoBulling in Lisbon,
said by phone. The stock also dropped after Natixis’s lower
price target, he said. Natixis cited weaker-than-expected
traffic figures for the cut.  The shares fell 7.9 percent to finish at 2.99 euros, the
lowest close since December 1997. It was Brisa’s biggest-one-day
decline since April 2010.  Brisa expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization minus  capital spending  of at least 350 million
euros ($503 million) this year, Mello said. Ebitda excluding
capital spending was 345 million euros last year, according to a
company presentation.  Toll revenue dropped 1.7 percent to 261.7 million euros in
the first half, the company said in a statement July 29. Total
revenue rose 2.2 percent to 323.7 million euros.  “This stock is still a bet on Portugal’s macroeconomic
situation, as it has been for over a year,” said Natixis
analysts including Gregoire Thibault.  To contact the reporter on this story:
