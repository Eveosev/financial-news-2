Buying options on the SPDR Gold Trust
exchange-traded fund can help protect against financial-market
uncertainty that is likely to boost the price of the metal,
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Amyn X. Bharwani said in a note today.  Investors should purchase October $163 calls while selling
October $177 calls, according to Bharwani, a New York-based
analyst, in a strategy known as a spread that cuts the cost of
the trade while capping potential profit. The ETF fell 0.4
percent to $157.72 at 4 p.m. in New York.  JPMorgan’s commodities strategists predict gold will
advance to $1,800 an ounce in the fourth quarter of the year
amid the European debt crisis, emerging-market inflation and a
weak  U.S. dollar , the note said. Gold fell 0.6 percent to
$1,621.70 today. Countries including India and  China  have been
raising  interest rates  to combat quickening inflation, while
 Greece , Ireland and Portugal have been forced to seek external
aid to manage sovereign-debt crises.  “Gold remains the universal thermometer of global
worries,” Bharwani quoted a July 26 report from John Bridges,
JPMorgan’s precious-metals equity analyst, as saying. “We
continue to like gold and the gold equities as hedges against
uncertainty.”  The call spread trade can be bought for $2.71, Bharwani
said, and the maximum potential loss is the premium paid, while
profit could be as high as $11.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
