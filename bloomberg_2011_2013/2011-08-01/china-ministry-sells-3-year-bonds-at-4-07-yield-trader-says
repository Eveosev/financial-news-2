China ’s  finance ministry  sold at
least 22.66 billion yuan ($3.5 billion) of three-year bonds at
an average yield of 4.07 percent, according to a trader at a
 finance company  that participates in government debt auctions.  The ministry sold the debt to raise funds for local
governments and, unlike at last month’s auction of similar
three-year notes, brought in the targeted amount of funds. The
July 11 sale saw 23.9 billion yuan of bonds issued at a yield of
3.93 percent, short of the 25 billion yuan goal.  The government also failed to raise as much money as
planned at regular sales of 182-day bills and three-year notes
in the first half of July, as well as at one-year debt auctions
in May and June.  Demand for the securities is cooling as policy makers push
up borrowing costs and drain funds from the financial system to
help damp inflation, which hit a three-year high of 6.4 percent
in June. President  Hu Jintao  said on July 21 stabilizing prices
will be a priority in the second half, after the central bank
raised  interest rates  five times since September and lifted the
amount major banks have to set aside as reserves to a record
21.5 percent, from 17 percent.  The finance ministry in January published a list of 59
banks and brokerages required to bid at its debt sales,
including Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd.,
Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., Bank of China Ltd., China
Construction Bank Corp., China Citic Bank Corp., Postal Savings
Bank of China, Industrial Bank Co., Guotai Junan Securities Co.
and BOC International (China) Ltd.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
