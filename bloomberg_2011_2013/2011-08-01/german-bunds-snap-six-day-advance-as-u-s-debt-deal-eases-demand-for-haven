German bonds snapped a six-day
advance as optimism that U.S. lawmakers will push through a
compromise on the debt ceiling and avoid a default led investors
to seek higher-yielding assets.  Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds outperformed benchmark
bunds for the first time in four days and European stocks
rallied as the  House of Representatives  prepared to vote on a
deal to raise the debt limit by at least $2.1 trillion and slash
 government spending . The yield on the 10-year bund rose from the
lowest in more than two weeks even as reports showed euro-area
unemployment held at 9.9 percent for a fourth month and
manufacturing weakened, casting doubt on the strength of the
region’s economic recovery.  The U.S. debt agreement has provided a “general breath of
relief” and created a “broader risk-on” environment, said
Marius Daheim, a senior fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische
Landesbank  in Munich. “Even Italian bonds are being
supported.”  Ten-year bund yields advanced four basis points to 2.58
percent as of 11:28 a.m. in  London . The 3.25 percent security
maturing in July 2021 fell 0.34, or 3.4 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,440) face amount, to 105.815. Yields on two-year notes also
rose five basis points, to 1.20 percent.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.7 percent and  U.S.
government debt  declined.  U.S. ‘Uncertain’  The House plans votes today and the Senate may follow suit
to consider the agreement reached during a weekend of
negotiations that capped a months-long struggle over raising the
$14.3 trillion debt ceiling. Negotiations were spurred after
second-quarter growth missed estimates last week.  “I would have expected fixed-income to go much lower,”
said  Glenn Marci , a strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt .
“Ten-year yields are still below 2.60 percent; that’s not
really a sign of relief. The picture for the U.S. is still
uncertain, particularly after the GDP numbers, and people are
not that willing to return to the U.S.” markets, he said.  Bunds remained lower after data showed European
manufacturing growth weakened for a third month in July, adding
to signs that the region’s economy is losing momentum. A
manufacturing gauge based on a survey of purchasing managers in
the 17-nation euro region fell to 50.4 from 52 in June, the
lowest reading since October 2009, when it was below 50 for a
16th straight month. A number above 50 indicates expansion.  Europe Unemployment  At 21 percent,  Spain  had the highest jobless rate in the
euro region, while Austria the lowest at 4 percent, said the
European Union statistics office in Luxembourg.  The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds fell 10 basis points to
5.98 percent, reducing the additional yield investors demand to
hold the securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds by
15 basis points to 339 basis points.  Italy’s 10-year yield slid 13 basis points as the
 unemployment rate  fell to near a two-year low. The Italian-
German yield spread narrowed by 15 basis points to 318 basis
points.  Portuguese bonds declined, pushing the two-year note yield
17 basis points higher to 14.76 percent. Similar-maturity Irish
yields gained 13 basis points to 14.50 percent.  French bonds were little changed before an auction of
bills. The Netherlands sold 2.46 billion euro of three-month
bills at an average yield of 0.9 percent, six-month bills at 1
percent and nine-month bills at 1.105 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors 3 percent this
year, compared with 4.3 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds have lost 0.2
percent, while Italian debt has slipped 3.5 percent and
 Portugal ’s has declined 22 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
