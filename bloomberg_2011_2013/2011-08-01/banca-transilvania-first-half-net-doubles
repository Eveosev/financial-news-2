Banca Transilvania (TLV)  SA,  Romania ’s
second-largest publicly traded bank, said profit almost doubled
in the first half of this year on declining bad-loan charges as
the country moved out of a two-year recession.  Net income advanced to 65.7 million lei ($22 million) from
33 million lei a year earlier, the Cluj-Napoca, Romania-based
bank said today in a statement sent to the  Bucharest Stock
Exchange . Bad-loan costs dropped 10 percent to 295 million lei
from 330 million lei in the same period last year as the quality
of the bank’s loan portfolio is stabilizing, it said.  Romania’s economy is expected to grow 1.5 percent in 2011,
driven by surging exports and industrial output, after shrinking
1.3 percent last year, according to the  International Monetary
Fund . The country’s banking industry, dominated by international
lenders, are waiting for credit growth to pick up after state
workers recovered half of a 25 percent wage cut last year and
the  unemployment rate  fell to 30-month low of 4.8 percent in
June.  “The bank’s first-half earnings are once again promising,
as we focused on the sustainable increase in profit and market
share,” Banca Transilvania Chief Executive Officer Robert C. Rekkers said in the statement. “We know that 2011 will continue
to be a challenging year, so that’s why we are cautious and at
the same time, ready to reach our goals for this year.”  Banca Transilvania, whose largest shareholder is the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development with 14.6
percent, said operating revenue increased 3 percent to 746.6
million lei and operating expenses rose 9 percent to 366 million
lei, as it expanded its network, the bank said.  First-half net assets rose 5 percent to 22.7 billion lei
from 21.6 billion lei at the end of last year, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
