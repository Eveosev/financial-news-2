Ford Motor Co. (F)  is recalling more than
1 million trucks, including the F-150, the top-selling U.S.
vehicle, because straps that secure fuel tanks to the vehicles
may corrode and cause the tanks to fall.  The defect has led to three fires and one injury, Wesley Sherwood, a Ford spokesman, said in an e-mail. The  National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration  announced the recall today
on its website.  The recalls follow an investigation opened last year by the
U.S. auto-safety regulator. They are made in 21 U.S. states, and
the  District of Columbia , where de-icing chemicals used on roads
in cold weather may cause corrosion of the metal straps.  “Ford has been polishing their image and getting it very,
very good, so this doesn’t help,” said  Jim Hall , principal of
2953 Analytics Inc., a consulting firm in Birmingham,  Michigan .
“They’ve got to get ahold of the affected customers fast; get
it handled and put to bed. Don’t let it linger.”  The trucks being recalled are “older, higher-mileage”
vehicles and have fuel-tank straps that “can corrode after
operation for extended periods of time in high-corrosion
areas,” Sherwood said.  Mid-September Notification  Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, said the recall covers
1.1 million  pickup trucks , including F-150s from model years
1997 to 2004; F-250s from model years 1997 to 1999; and Lincoln
Blackwoods from model years 2002 to 2003.  The company said it will notify owners of affected vehicles
in mid-September and make repairs at no cost. If replacement
straps aren’t available when the recall repairs are done, the
company said it may install a cable support under the fuel-tank
strap as an interim repair.  Ford earlier this year recalled more than 1 million F-150s
for air-bag defects after a push by U.S. regulators. Air bags in
trucks from model years 2004 to 2006 may not deploy when needed.
None of the trucks were included in both recalls, Sherwood said.  Ford rose 14 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $12.35 at 4:02 p.m.
