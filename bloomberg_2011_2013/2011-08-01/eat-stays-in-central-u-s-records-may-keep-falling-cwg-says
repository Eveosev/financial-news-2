The southern central U.S., including
 Texas , may have a record-breaking hot week, according to  Matt Rogers , president of the  Commodity Weather Group LLC  in
Bethesda, Maryland.  Rogers’s forecasts shows the most intense heat will remain
over parts of Texas, Oklahoma and  Arkansas  until Aug. 15. In
addition, the heat wave may cover most of the U.S. South with
the exception of  Florida , which will remain seasonal, Rogers
said in a note to clients today.  “The southern sections of the central U.S. could see one
of its hottest weeks ever with frequent records set in Texas,
the southern Plains, and nearby areas of the deep South,”
Rogers said.  Excess heat warnings and advisories stretch from  South
Dakota  and Minnesota to Texas and Louisiana. Natural gas traders
monitor weather forecasts to determine if temperatures may boost
heating or cooling needs.  The high temperature in Dallas is expected to reach 106
Fahrenheit (41 Celsius) today and remain at least that high all
week, according to the  National Weather Service . The average
high temperature for July was 101.7, according to the weather
service.  Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport has posted 30 days
of 100 degree days, the second most on record. The record is 42
days from June to August 1980, according to the weather service.  Arkansas Heat  The temperature climbed above 100 in Fort Smith, Arkansas
30 times in July, a record breaking the old mark set in 1934 by
five days, according to the weather service. The temperature has
reached that mark for the last 27 days in a row, which surpasses
the old record of 17 days set in 1934.  The high temperature in  Fort Smith  is forecast to reach 108
degrees today, 110 tomorrow and stay above 100 for the rest of
the week, according to the weather service. The temperature has
been above 100 in Wichita Falls, Texas since June 22 and has
only fallen below that mark twice in the last two months,
according to the weather service.  Rogers’s 6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day forecasts call for
the U.S. Northeast to remain seasonal through Aug. 6 to Aug. 15.
The Middle Atlantic states, including southern  New Jersey , may
experience continuing heat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
