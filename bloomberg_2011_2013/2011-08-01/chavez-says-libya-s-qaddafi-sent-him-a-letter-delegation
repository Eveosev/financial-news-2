Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez  said
Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  sent him a letter delivered by a
delegation that arrived in Caracas last night.  Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said he would meet the
delegation today. Chavez said he may not be able to meet the
envoys because he is receiving treatment for an undisclosed form
of cancer.  Chavez, who has criticized Western intervention in the
Libyan conflict and compared Qaddafi to South American liberator
 Simon Bolivar , in March proposed an international peace
commission to negotiate an end to the unrest in Libya. His offer
was rejected by the Libyan rebels.  “Qaddafi has sent some emissaries and a letter,” Chavez
said during a telephone interview broadcast on state television
today. “There’s Qaddafi, resisting the aggressions of NATO --
they bombed a media outlet -- and the world remains quiet with
its arms crossed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
