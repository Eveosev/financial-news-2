The Australian dollar fell against
all of its 16 most-traded counterparts after the  Reserve Bank 
kept its cash rate unchanged, citing global “uncertainty.”  The Aussie dropped to a one-week low versus the  U.S. dollar 
after central-bank Governor  Glenn Stevens  said the pace of
global growth is slowing and “it is appropriate under such
circumstances for monetary policy to exert a degree of
restraint.” He kept the rate at 4.75 percent. Australian 10-
year yields fell to a two-year low.  New Zealand ’s dollar dropped
against the greenback as stocks and commodities fell.  “Clearly it’s bearish for the Aussie dollar,” said  Adam Carr , a senior economist in Sydney at ICAP Australia Ltd., a
unit of the world’s biggest interdealer broker. “They’re citing
concerns over global growth. These concerns aren’t going away. I
think it’s quite reasonable that we don’t get another rate hike
until well into 2012.”  Australia’s dollar dropped 1.5 percent to $1.0809 at 1:33
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0971 yesterday. It touched $1.0807,
the lowest level since July 25. The Aussie slid 1.6 percent to
83.36 yen, from 84.71 yen.  New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the kiwi, fell 0.8
percent to 86.91 U.S. cents, from 87.65 cents yesterday, when it
touched 88.43 cents, the most since it was freely floated in
1985. It sank 1 percent to 67.02 yen, from 67.67 yesterday, when
it climbed to 68.89 yen, the highest level since May 2010.  The kiwi reached NZ$1.2420 per Australian dollar, its
strongest since August 2010, from NZ$1.2515 yesterday, before
trading at NZ$1.2435.  Eighth Meeting  The MSCI World Index of stocks dropped 2.4 percent, and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials declined as
much as 0.4 percent.  Stevens kept the overnight cash rate target unchanged for a
record eighth-straight meeting, as forecast by 21 of 25
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. In its statement, the
central bank said “the board remains concerned about the
medium-term outlook for inflation.” It cited “the acute sense
of uncertainty” in financial markets as a key factor for
inaction.  Yields on  Australia ’s 10-year debt lost as much as 18 basis
points to 4.72 percent, the first time they fell below 4.75
percent on an intraday basis since September. It was the lowest
level since May 2009.  Australia’s currency was the worst performer today among
the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. It lost 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
