U.K. stocks declined for a third day
after U.S.  consumer spending  unexpectedly dropped for the first
time in almost two years, deepening concern that growth in the
world’s largest economy is stalling.  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  slid 3.6 percent, leading a retreat by mining
companies, after posting earnings that missed analysts’
estimates.  Hargreaves Lansdown Plc (HL/)  led the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  lower,
losing 13 percent.  The FTSE 100 fell 56.04, or 1 percent, to 5,718.39 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London, its lowest level in five weeks. The
benchmark measure has slumped 6.1 percent since its peak this
year on Feb. 8 amid concern that growth in the U.S. and  Europe 
will slow. The FTSE All-Share Index dropped 1.1 percent today,
while Ireland’s ISEQ Index retreated 1.7 percent.  Data coming out of the U.S. “shows how fragile sentiment
is,” said  David Jones , chief market strategist at IG Index in
 London . “People feel very nervous at the moment.”  The  House of Representatives  approved legislation yesterday
to increase the U.S. debt limit by $2.1 trillion and cut federal
spending by $2.4 trillion. The Senate will vote on the deal
later today.  The U.S. deficit deal will add to a reduction in growth
next year of 1.5 percentage points coming from the expiration of
past stimulus programs, according to economists at JPMorgan
Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG.  U.S. Personal Spending  Consumer spending in the U.S. fell 0.2 percent in June as a
slump in hiring caused households to retrench, Commerce
Department figures showed today. The median estimate of 77
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had called for a 0.1
percent increase.  Xstrata sank 3.6 percent to 1,235.5 pence after posting
first-half earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization that increased 30 percent to $5.82 billion. That
missed the average analyst estimate of $5.93 billion.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second-largest mining company,
fell 2.5 percent to 4,176 pence.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the biggest,
dropped 1.9 percent to 2,214.5 pence.  Hargreaves Lansdown, Britain’s largest retail broker,
slumped 13 percent to 506.5 pence, its biggest drop since its
initial public offering in 2007. The U.K.’s Financial Services
Authority published rules yesterday requiring independent
financial advisers to disclose fees they receive for directing
clients into certain funds. The rules come into force from the
end of next year. The proposals won’t have a material effect on
Hargreaves’s business, the Bristol-based company said in a
statement today.  Centamin, Fresnillo  Centamin Egypt Ltd. (CEY)  tumbled 20 percent to 109.6 pence, the
gold producer’s biggest decline since its initial public
offering in 2001, after cutting its projected output.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s largest primary silver producer,
jumped 4.6 percent to 1,813 pence after reporting first-half net
income of $553.2 million, more than double the $258.9 million it
posted a year earlier.  BP Plc (BP/) , Europe’s second biggest oil company, dropped 2.4
percent to 447.1 pence as crude declined for a third day in  New
York , its longest losing streak since May.  Amlin Plc (AML)  plunged 16 percent to 335 pence, the Lloyd’s of
London insurer’s biggest drop since September 2001, after saying
that its first-half profit may miss analysts’ estimates.  Northumbrian Water  Northumbrian Water Group Plc (NWG)  led a rally of U.K. water
utilities, jumping 4.5 percent to 469.5 pence after a group led
by Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. agreed to buy the
Durham-based company for 2.4 billion pounds ($3.9 billion).  Severn Trent Plc climbed 2.5 percent to 1,451 pence, while
 United Utilities Group Plc (UU/)  rose 1.1 percent to 591 pence.  National Grid Plc (NG/) , operator of the U.K.’s power and gas
networks, gained 2 percent to 602.5 pence after Ofgem, the U.K.
energy regulator, said it will extend the energy transmission
price control regime for one year until March 2013.  Rotork Plc (ROR) , the world’s largest maker of valve actuators
used in oil pipelines, surged 8.1 percent to 1,695 pence, its
biggest jump since March 2009. The company predicted that full-
year sales will be “materially ahead” of previous forecasts.  Moneysupermarket.com Group Plc (MONY) , whose Web sites allow users
to compare prices of financial products, soared 7.6 percent to
120.4 pence after reporting first-half net income of 8.8 million
pounds, compared with 1.9 million pounds for the same period a
year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
