Tiger Woods  will contest November’s
Australian Open golf tournament, marking his first appearance in
Sydney for 15 years.  The former world No. 1-ranked golfer will join a field
including seventh-ranked  Dustin Johnson , No. 8 Jason Day and
defending champion Geoff Ogilvy for the Nov. 10-13 event at The
Lakes Golf Club, the  PGA Tour  of Australasia said today.  Woods, 35, last played in Sydney when he tied for fifth at
the 1996 Australian Open. This year’s edition is scheduled the
week before the U.S. and International teams contest the
biennial Presidents Cup at Royal Melbourne.  Woods played at the Australian Masters in Melbourne the
past two years. His 2009 win at Kingston Heath, which came days
before the car accident outside of his Florida home that led to
his admission of marital infidelity, remains his most recent
tournament victory.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
