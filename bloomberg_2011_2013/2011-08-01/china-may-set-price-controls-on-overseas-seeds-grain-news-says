China  may impose price caps on seeds
produced by foreign-owned companies to reduce their influence in
the domestic market, Grain News reported, citing an unidentified

dominating the flower and vegetable seed industries, the
Zhengzhou-based newspaper said.  The team of government investigators is drafting the final
report of the probe, Grain News said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
