Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) ,  Australia ’s
biggest gold producer, said it needs to expand production at the
Bonikro site in West Africa to make the unit a viable part of
its portfolio of mines.  Exploration to increase Bonikro’s resource base is expected
to start from the next quarter, Colin Moorhead, executive
general manager of exploration of the Melbourne-based company,
said at a conference today in Western Australia. Bonikro,
located near Hire, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of
the commercial capital Abidjan, produces about 120,000 ounces of
gold a year.  “We’re certainly not there for a 100,000 ounce
operation,” Moorhead said. The mine was shut for a number of
months starting in December because of political unrest in  Ivory
Coast .  Spot gold, which reached a record $1,632.80 an ounce on
July 29, advanced 8.5 percent last month on concern that
sovereign-debt crises in the U.S. and  Europe  may derail the
global economic recovery. Newcrest acquired Bonikro and the
surrounding exploration area when it bought smaller rival Lihir
Gold Ltd. in August last year.  Newcrest produced 2.7 million ounces during the financial
year ended June 30 from operations in Australia,  Papua New
Guinea  and Indonesia. The company in June announced it’s selling
two of its smaller mines in Australia.  Newcrest rose as much as 1.3 percent to A$40.07 and traded
at A$39.82 as of 2:27 p.m. in Sydney. The stock has declined 1.5
percent this year, compared with a 5 percent drop in the
benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
