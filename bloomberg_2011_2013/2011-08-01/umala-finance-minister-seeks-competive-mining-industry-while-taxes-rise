Peruvian President  Ollanta Humala ’s
government is in talks with mining companies on a new mining
windfall tax to ensure the country remains competitive even as
it seeks to boost state control over its natural resources.  Mining companies are waiting for the outcome of the
negotiations before moving ahead with about $40 billion in
planned investment, Finance Minister Miguel Castilla said today.
 Peru  is the world’s third-largest copper and zinc producer.  “This will be a new tax regime that maximizes government
income while not endangering important new investment projects
and ensuring legal stability for contracts,” he told Lima-based
 Radioprogramas . “Miners, which are posting fairly high profits,
should contribute more to the country’s development.”  Humala, a former army rebel, is seeking to reassure
investors that his plans to raise mining royalties and tighten
state control over assets won’t erode economic growth that under
predecessor  Alan Garcia  during the past 5 years was the fastest
in  Latin America .  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  on July 29 delayed approval
of its $3 billion Quellaveco copper project to 2012 from 2011.  Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO) , Peru’s biggest copper producer,
doubled second-quarter net income to $658 million, while
precious-metals producer Cia. de Minas Buenaventura SA, Peru’s
biggest, saw its profit jump 83 percent to $204.2 million.  Peru’s mining export revenue jumped 27 percent to $21
billion last year as copper tripled from 2008 and gold jumped 76
percent.  Copper futures for September delivery fell 7 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $4.41 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Gold for December delivery fell $2.70, or 0.2 percent, to
$1,628.50 an ounce after touching a record $1,637.50 on July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
