Oasmia Pharmaceutical AB (OASM)  rose the
most in seven weeks in  Stockholm  trading after its Paclical drug
showed positive results in a late-stage clinical trial in
ovarian cancer.  Shares in the Uppsala, Sweden-based company, which
specializes in human and veterinary oncology, advanced 1.45
kronor, or 12 percent, to 14 kronor at 5:30 p.m. in Stockholm.
It was the stock’s biggest gain since June 13.  Oasmia tested the effectiveness of Paclical by measuring
levels of CA 125, a protein often detected in elevated levels in
patients with ovarian cancer. An interim analysis showed the
water-soluble drug, which is given as a one-hour infusion,
reduced CA 125 levels as well as the older cancer treatment
Taxol, Oasmia said today in a statement. It’s the first time
researchers have used the approach in a late-stage trial, Oasmia
said.  Paclical has the same active ingredient as Taxol, which
requires a three-hour infusion and additional medication, though
Paclical has fewer side effects, Oasmia said. The company said
it plans to apply to the European Medicines Agency for marketing
approval for the drug based on the results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
