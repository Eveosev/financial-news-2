Massachusetts ’s attorney general sued
Johnson & Johnson’s Ortho-McNeil-Janssen unit for improper
marketing of the anti-psychotic drug Risperdal.  The company marketed the drug as a treatment for dementia
in the elderly and a way to ease various ailments of younger
people when those uses hadn’t been approved by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, Attorney General  Martha Coakley  said today
in a statement.  Johnson & Johnson’s promotion of Risperdal for dementia
failed to disclose “an increased risk of death” associated
with the drug, according to the  statement . The FDA approved the
medication primarily for treating schizophrenia and bipolar mood
disorder, according to Coakley’s office.  “Janssen’s illegal marketing and sales tactics helped the
company generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sales in the
Commonwealth,” the complaint states.  Teresa Mueller, a spokeswoman for  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s
 Janssen  unit, said the company will “vigorously defend” itself
against the claims.  “We are committed to ethical business practices and have
policies in place to insure that our products are only promoted
for their FDA-approved indications,” she said today in a
telephone interview.  The case is Massachusetts v. Ortho-McNeil-Janssen
Pharmaceuticals Inc., 11-2811, Commonwealth of Massachusetts,
Suffolk Superior Court (Boston).  Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick,  New Jersey , fell
38 cents to $64.41 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have gained 4.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
