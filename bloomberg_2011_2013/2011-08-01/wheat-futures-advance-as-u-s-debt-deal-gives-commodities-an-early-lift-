Wheat and corn rose in Chicago after
President  Barack Obama  said U.S. lawmakers agreed to raise the
federal debt limit, avoiding a possible default.  Both grains climbed for a first session in three after
falling 2.6 percent on July 29 on concern talks would fail to
produce an accord. Without an agreement, the U.S. may have
defaulted tomorrow. The House plans votes on the measure today,
and the Senate may follow suit.  Grains were “buoyed by news over a preliminary agreement
to increase the debt ceiling after negotiations over the
weekend,” Sudakshina Unnikrishnan, an analyst at Barclays
Capital in London, said in a report today.  Wheat for December delivery gained 12.75 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $7.285 a bushel by 1:15 p.m. London time on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade. Milling wheat for November delivery
traded on NYSE Liffe in Paris added 1 euro, or 0.5 percent, to
198.75 euros ($286.32) a metric ton.  Corn for December delivery advanced 8.75 cents, or 1.3
percent, to $6.775 a bushel in Chicago. Prices are up 7.7
percent this year, making corn the second-best-performing grain
in 2011 behind rice, which has added 15 percent.  Congressional leaders reached a bipartisan agreement to
raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling by at least $2.1 trillion
and slash government spending by $2.4 trillion or more.  Raw
materials  from crude oil to tin advanced.  “The early lift in the commodity complex certainly appears
to be tied to the debt news that’s come out of the U.S.,” said
 Luke Mathews , a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. “The markets have responded very positively.”  Soybeans Climb  November-delivery soybeans rose 14.75 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $13.72 a bushel. The oilseed gained for a first
session in four.  Corn and soybean crops in reproductive and filling stages
are likely to face increased stress in the U.S. Midwest as
hotter, drier weather persists through the early part of this
week before showers and more seasonal weather return later in
the period, Joel Burgio, senior agricultural meteorologist at
Telvent DTN Inc., said in a forecast July 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
