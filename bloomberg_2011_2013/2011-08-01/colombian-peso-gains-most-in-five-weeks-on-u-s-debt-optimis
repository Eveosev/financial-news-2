Colombia’s peso rose the most in five
weeks after President  Barack Obama  said U.S. congressional
leaders reached an agreement to raise the debt ceiling.  The peso advanced 0.6 percent to 1,768 per dollar at 2:34
p.m. New York time, from 1,778.38 on July 29. That’s its biggest
jump on a closing basis since June 28. The peso has risen 7.9
percent so far this year, the best performance among the six
most-traded Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “As the U.S. avoids a default, we should see the peso
regain its strengthening trend,” said Daniel Velandia, the head
analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Correval SA.  The Treasury Department has said it will breach the
borrowing limit and run out of options for avoiding default
tomorrow without action by Congress to raise the debt ceiling.
The House plans votes today and the Senate may follow suit to
consider the agreement reached during a weekend of negotiations
that capped a months-long struggle between Obama and Republicans
over raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.  Colombia  may take further measures to contain gains in the
peso should it strengthen to within a range of 1,700 to 1,740,
Velandia predicts. Banco de la Republica may impose limits on
foreign borrowing, he said.  Overseas loans jumped to $4.5 billion in the first half of
the year, up from $2.7 billion a year earlier, according to
 trade balance  figures from the central bank.  In a bid to ease the peso’s rally, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in April that the government would create
an overseas fund with as much as $1.2 billion from dollars
bought in the local market through the end of 2011, and forgo
repatriating funds from abroad for the rest of the year. Since
Sept. 15, the central bank has bought a minimum of $20 million
daily in the  currency market , and plans to keep up the purchases
until at least Sept. 30.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.61 percent,
according to the stock exchange. The bond’s price rose 0.272
centavo to 119.273 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
