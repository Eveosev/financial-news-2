Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  received formal
approval from India to take over  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE) ’s domestic
unit on condition an agreement is reached on sharing royalty
payments currently covered by state-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  Vedanta and Cairn Energy must agree the payments by ONGC,
owner of 30 percent of a joint venture with Cairn India Ltd. to
develop the Rajasthan field, are “cost recoverable,” according
to the conditions published by Vedanta in a statement today.  The resource company, a metals producer without experience
in oil or natural gas output, waited 11 months to clinch a deal
that gives it access to India’s biggest onshore oil deposit as
the government studied ONGC’s demand to alter royalty terms.
ONGC is liable for all royalties on production from the deposit.  “Vedanta is working with Cairn Energy to satisfy these
conditions and complete this transaction,” according to the
statement. The company plans to close the deal within six weeks
and Cairn  India  has begun eliciting shareholders’ consent, Chief
Executive Officer Mahendra Singh Mehta said on July 29.  Cairn India will need to get a “no objection certificate”
for the transaction from its production partners, while Cairn
Energy will drop a court case surrounding a tax-payment dispute
on an Indian oil field, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
