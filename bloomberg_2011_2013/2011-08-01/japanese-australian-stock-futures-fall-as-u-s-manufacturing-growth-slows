Japanese and Australian stock futures
fell after a report showing the slowest growth in U.S.
manufacturing in two years spurred concern the global economic
recovery is faltering.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
largest maker of cameras and office equipment that gets more
than 80 percent of its revenue abroad, declined 1.1 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
the biggest global carmaker that gets 28 percent of sales in
 North America , dropped 0.3 percent. ADRs of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ,
the world’s largest mining company and Australia’s No. 1 oil
producer, lost 2.3 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,815 in  Chicago  yesterday, compared with
9,970 in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,820
in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index declined 1.6 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
slipped 0.3 percent in Wellington.  The U.S. manufacturing report showed “the economy is
slowing globally, and that heightens uncertainties about the
outlook of earnings at companies expecting recovery in the
second-half period,” said  Kenichi Hirano , general manager and
strategist at Tachibana Securities Co. in  Tokyo .  In New York yesterday, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost
0.4 percent to 1,286.94 as slower-than-forecast growth in
manufacturing erased a rally triggered by speculation lawmakers
would raise the federal debt ceiling.  House Approves Bill  Futures on the index rose 0.1 percent today after the House
approved legislation to raise the debt limit by at least $2.1
trillion and cut federal spending by $2.4 trillion or more, one
day before a threatened default.  The House voted 269-161 for the plan negotiated by leaders
and President Barack Obama over the weekend. The measure goes to
the Senate for a final vote planned tomorrow.  A report showed U.S. manufacturing expanded in July at the
slowest pace in two years, indicating the industry that’s been
driving the economic expansion is starting to weaken. The
Institute for Supply Management’s factory index fell to 50.9
last month from 55.3 in June. Economists projected the index
would drop to 54.5, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg News survey. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  The yen appreciated to as high as 76.30 against the dollar
yesterday, the strongest level since March. Against the euro,
 Japan ’s currency strengthened to 108.72 from 111.72 at the close
of stock trading in Tokyo yesterday. A stronger yen hurts
Japanese exporters because it cuts the value of overseas sales.  Intervention Report  The yen pared its gains against the dollar to 77.50 after
the Nikkei newspaper reported the Japanese government is
preparing steps to reverse the currency’s recent gains and the
 Bank of Japan  may consider a 5 trillion ($65 billion) to 10
trillion yen expansion of a 40 trillion yen asset-buying fund at
an Aug. 4- 5 meeting.  The U.S. government told Japanese officials that all
available measures to stabilize the currencies should be used,
Nikkei also reported, without indentifying the sources of its
information. Coordinated yen-selling by Japan, the U.S. and
 Europe  wouldn’t be ruled out if the currency continues to
strengthen, according to Nikkei.  “People were afraid shares may plunge if the yen
strengthens against the dollar further, but if intervention
helps sustain the currency’s level, that should provide a sense
of ease,” Tachibana Securities’ Hirano said.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 2.3 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the S&P 500
and 10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  Crude oil for September delivery fell 1.4 percent to $94.39
a barrel in  New York  yesterday. The London Metal Exchange Index
of prices for six industrial metals including copper and
aluminum declined 1.6 percent, the most since July 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
