(Corrects story from July 29 to change time period of
spending in second paragraph.)  Brazil’s government will review its
procedures for contracting work on its highways and railroads
after President  Dilma Rousseff  forced out more than a dozen top
officials at the Transportation Ministry on allegations of
overbilling and kickbacks.  Budget Minister Miriam Belchior made the announcement today
while presenting a report detailing progress on the government’s
four-year, 955 billion reais ($610 billion) infrastructure
drive. In the first six months after Rousseff took office Jan.
1, Brazil spent 86.4 billion reais on public works including
expanding the nation’s ports, improving  living conditions  in
urban shantytowns and building hydroelectric dams in the Amazon
rain forest.  Of that amount, 10.3 billion reais through July 27 came
from the federal government’s budget, Belchior said. The
remainder of the funding came from private investors and state
and local governments.  “We want to put the foot on the accelerator and correct
procedures that caused delays,” Belchior told reporters at a
press conference today in Brasilia.  Rousseff’s government aims to ramp up investment in its
overburdened infrastructure while simultaneously controlling
spending to cool the fastest inflation since 2005. Consumer
prices jumped 6.71 percent in June from a year ago.  Brazil  fell 16 places this year in a  World Bank  study
ranking countries for their export competitiveness. The bank
cited poor highways and long delays for unloading cargo at ports
in ranking Brazil 114 out of 183 countries for ease of trading
across borders in its “Doing Business 2011” survey.  Rousseff this month forced Transportation Minister Alfredo Nascimento to resign along with several of his advisers over
allegations of corruption at the ministry that were reported by
several newspapers.  The president’s move to clean house in a ministry whose
budget rivals the size of  Paraguay ’s $18 billion economy, and is
central to preparations for the 2014  World Cup  and the 2016
 Summer Olympics , has roiled members of her coalition. Nascimento
is a leader of the Party of the Republic, one of 15 parties
Rousseff depends on to approve legislation in Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
