Chile’s peso climbed on optimism that
the  U.S. Congress  will pass an agreement to raise the debt
ceiling and avoid default, increasing investor appetite for
riskier emerging-market assets.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 456.85 pesos per  U.S. dollar 
at 2:01 p.m. New York time, from 457.79 on July 29. The currency
advanced 2.1 percent last month.  “The markets are taking the agreement in the U.S. as a
positive sign,” Euguenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at
Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa, said in a telephone interview
from Santiago. “As long as the dollar doesn’t rise strongly
against other currencies, the peso will keep rising.”  U.S. Republican leaders, with no extra time before a
default threatened for tomorrow, voiced optimism that Congress
will pass a compromise with President Barack Obama to raise the
U.S. debt limit by at least $2.1 trillion and slash federal
spending by $2.4 trillion or more.  The House plans to vote today on the agreement reached
during a weekend of negotiations that capped a months-long
struggle between Obama and Republicans over raising the $14.3
trillion debt ceiling. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said he
expects a vote “hopefully during” today’s session.  “The markets are less worried, so investors have more of
an appetite for risk, which benefits the peso,” Cortes said.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 5.52 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
