Northumbrian Water Group Plc (NWG) ’s board
has recommended a 2.4 billion-pound ($3.9 billion) takeover
offer from Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing’s  Cheung Kong
Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. (1038) , the Daily Telegraph reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The board met over the last few days to approve the bid,
which totals 4.7 billion pounds including net debt, according to
the newspaper. Archie Berens, a spokesman for Northumbrian
Water, declined to comment when contacted by telephone today.
There was no immediate response to a voicemail message left at
Cheung Kong Infrastructure’s Hong Kong headquarters outside of
normal business hours.  Northumbrian Water, the Durham, England-based supplier to
about 4.4 million customers in the U.K., said on July 11 that it
had received a non-binding offer of 2.4 billion pounds from
Cheung Kong Infrastructure, known as CKI.  CKI has invested in electricity, gas, water and road assets
in  New Zealand , Australia,  China , the U.K. and Canada and has
been looking for further acquisitions. Last year, it led a group
that agreed to buy Electricite de France SA’s U.K. power
networks for 5.8 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
