Germany’s economy will “markedly
cool” in 2012 as demand for German goods in the U.S. is curbed
by that country’s debt woes, said  Peter Bofinger , an economic
adviser to  Chancellor Angela Merkel , the  Rheinische Post 
newspaper said.  The U.S. government will probably accept no tax increases
in an accord with Congress to raise the debt limit, Bofinger
said in an interview published today. The compromise is flawed
as a result, and will dent consumer spending and investment that
spur demand for German imports, the Wuerzburg University
academic was cited as saying.  “The U.S. government is hopelessly underfinanced,” with
revenue accounting for just 31 percent of its gross domestic
product compared with 45 percent in the euro region, Bofinger
said, according to the newspaper.  “Without tax increases, which evidently President Obama
can’t push through, the U.S. will go to the dogs,” Bofinger is
cited as saying. In  Germany , ‘these developments will
unfortunately contribute to halting the economic upswing.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
