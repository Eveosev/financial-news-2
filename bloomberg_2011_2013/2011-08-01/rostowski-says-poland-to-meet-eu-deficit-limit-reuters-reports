Poland is on schedule to narrow its
general government deficit to less than the European Union limit
of 3 percent of gross domestic product next year, Finance
Minister Jacek Rostowski told Reuters in an interview.  “Ninety percent of the measures needed to bring about that
result have already been taken,” he said in the interview
published today. “Secondly, developments so far this year
suggest that we are on track.”  “Further measures and the introduction of a permanent
expenditure rule” will be needed to continue deficit reduction
in coming years, Rostowski told Reuters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
