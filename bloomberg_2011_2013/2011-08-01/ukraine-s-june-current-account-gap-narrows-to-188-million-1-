Ukraine’s current-account deficit
narrowed in June from the previous month as exports increased,
the central bank said.  The shortfall totaled $188 million in June, compared with
$790 million the previous month, the Kiev-based Natsionalnyi
Bank Ukrainy said today in a statement on its  website . That
helped trim the second-quarter current-account deficit to $1.22
billion from $1.30 billion in the previous three months.  Exports jumped 41.8 percent in June as the government
lifted restrictions on grain shipments introduced in October
last year and demand for the country’s chemical products
revived, the central bank said.  Import-growth slowed to 43.3 percent in June from 52.8
percent the previous month, the bank said.  Foreign direct investment totaled $3 billion in the first
half, compared with $2.1 billion in the same period a year
earlier, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
