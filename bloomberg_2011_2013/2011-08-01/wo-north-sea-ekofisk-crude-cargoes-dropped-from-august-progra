Two cargoes of  North Sea  Ekofisk
crude were dropped from the August shipping schedule, according
to a revised loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The two 600,000-barrel cargoes were for Aug. 27 and Aug. 31
loading, according to the plan.  Last month, a total of 20 shipments of Ekofisk for loading
from July 27 to the end of August were deferred by two to three
days following the shutdown of BP Plcâ€™s Valhall and Hod oil
platforms in the North Sea after a fire on July 13. The two
fields are unlikely to start production before the middle of
this month, BP said today.  The Valhall platform processes crude produced from Hod. Oil
and natural gas liquids are routed via pipeline to Ekofisk for
transport to Teesside,  England .  The revisions mean Ekofisk production for August will fall
to 8.8 million barrels, or 283,871 barrels a day, compared with
272,581 barrels a day last month.  Ekofisk is one of four North Sea crude grades used to price
Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of global oil. The
other blends are Brent, Forties and Oseberg.  As a result, the total loadings of the four grades will
drop to 922,581 barrels a day in August, the lowest in more than
four years, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
shipping schedules.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
