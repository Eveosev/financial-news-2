Australian Foreign Minister  Kevin Rudd  is recovering after having heart surgery in Brisbane.  The scheduled four-hour operation to replace an aortic
valve that had been inserted 20 years ago was a success, Rudd’s
cardiologist, Malcolm Davison, told reporters in comments
broadcast on Sky News today. The surgery went according to plan
and Rudd is expected to remain unconscious and on a ventilator
until late today or tomorrow, Davison said.  The 53-year-old former prime minister will stay in
intensive care for two to three days and is expected to complete
a full recovery in about eight weeks, his doctor said. Rudd, who
led Labor to victory in 2007 after 11 years of conservative rule,
was replaced by Prime Minister  Julia Gillard  last June.  To contact the reporter for this story:
