Mauritius’s rupee advanced for the
first day in three against the dollar after U.S. lawmakers
agreed on a plan to prevent a default, boosting investor
appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets.  The rupee appreciated 0.7 percent to 27.80 per dollar as of
12:46 p.m. in  Port Louis , the capital.  Emerging-market stocks surged the most in more than two
weeks and commodity prices rallied after President  Barack Obama 
said leaders of both parties in the U.S. House and Senate had
approved an agreement to raise the nation’s debt ceiling by $2.1
trillion and cut the federal deficit by as much as $2.5 trillion
over a decade.  The debt deal “has calmed markets and brought risk
appetite back to the fore,” Mauritius Commercial Bank Ltd., the
island nation’s biggest lender, said in a research note
published on its website.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged from 27.1792 rupees to
27.3481 rupees, with a selling price of 28.645 rupees per
dollar, according to indicative rates on  Bank of Mauritius’s
website .  Mauritius’s 38-member SEMDEX index of stocks gained for a
second day, adding 0.4 percent to 2,035.02, led by  Mauritius
Commercial Bank (MCB)  and Harel Freres Ltd., a holding company with
interests in sugar cane, alcohol products and property
management.  To contact the reporter on this story:
