The U.S. will move its 2012 sugar
quota up one month to alleviate a supply shortage, the
Department of Agriculture said.  The quota for raw cane sugar imports for the government
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 will be 1.231 million short tons
(1.117 million metric tons), the USDA said today in an e-mail. A
notice of the decision was placed in the  Federal Register .  The allotment will be permitted to enter the country
starting on Sept. 1 “in response to increased tightness in the
U.S. raw cane-sugar market,” the USDA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
