Bulgaria’s customs office will appeal
a court ruling allowing Russian oil producer OAO Lukoil to
restart operations at its local refinery.  Lukoil’s permits for storing fuel at the Neftochim Burgas
plant were withdrawn last week in a dispute over fuel gauges.
The  Finance Ministry  had accused Lukoil of failing to install
the gauges to allow the authorities to calculate excise duty
remotely. The Sofia Administrative court earlier today ruled in
the refinery’s favor.  “The customs agency will appeal the lower court’s ruling
to the Supreme Administrative court,” Marina Popova, a customs
office official, said by phone today.  Bulgaria asked oil traders to install the gauges linked to
the customs office 15 months ago to curb  tax evasion . Lukoil’s
unit said it borrowed $11 million to install them by year-end.  Lukoil plans to resume full production at the Bulgarian
refinery as early as this week, Dmitry Dolgov, a spokesman at
the Moscow-based company, said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
