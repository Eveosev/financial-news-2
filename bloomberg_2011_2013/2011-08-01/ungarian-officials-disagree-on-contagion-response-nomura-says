Hungary ’s government and central bank
disagree on the best way to establish a “backstop” against
possible contagion from the euro-region debt crisis, a Nomura
Plc economist said after meetings last week in Budapest.  While the Cabinet believes planned spending cuts and
 China ’s commitment to buy Hungarian  government bonds  will
prevent the crisis from spreading to Hungary, the central bank
would like “something meatier,” Peter Attard Montalto said
today after meeting officials from the government, central bank
and  International Monetary Fund  on July 28.  The discussions are the “biggest area of disagreement”
between the government and central bank, Montalto said today in
an e-mailed report. “Discussions are currently ongoing between
the two parties and an announcement may be forthcoming shortly.
In the meantime, we worry about the lack of visible contagion
backstop in Hungary.”  The Hungarian forint weakened to a record low 238.94 per
Swiss franc on July 29, increasing the risk of default by
borrowers with franc-denominated home mortgages. The forint
traded at 235.03 per franc at 11:21 a.m. in Budapest, rising
after President  Barack Obama  announced an agreement to raise the
U.S. debt ceiling.  The central bank may seek “liquidity provisions,” a
renewal of swap lines with the  Swiss National Bank  and  European
Central Bank  and regulatory changes, Montalto said.  Repayment of the Hungary’s 20 billion-euro ($28.8 billion)
IMF loan was another area of disagreement between the government
and central bank, according to the Nomura report.  While Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s administration wants to
use reserves to pay the debt, the central bank would prefer the
government to sell foreign-currency bonds, Montalto said.  The central bank may keep the benchmark two-week deposit
rate at 6 percent through the second half of next year on risk
concerns, he said.  Montalto said he met with Magyar Nemzeti Bank Vice
President Julia Kiraly, Monetary Council member Janos Cinkotai,
Deputy Economy State Secretary Roland Natran as well as
officials from the IMF and local banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
