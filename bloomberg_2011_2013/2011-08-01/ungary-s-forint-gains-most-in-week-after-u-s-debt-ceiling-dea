Hungary’s forint appreciated the most
in a week against the euro after President Barack Obama said
Congressional leaders reached an agreement to raise America’s
debt ceiling, boosting investor demand for riskier assets
worldwide.  The forint strengthened as much as 0.8 percent, its biggest
intraday gain since July 25, and traded 0.6 percent stronger at
268.12 per euro as of 9:05 a.m. in Budapest. Against the Swiss
franc, the forint advanced 1.3 percent to 234.604, rebounding
from a record low of 238.942 per franc reached on July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
