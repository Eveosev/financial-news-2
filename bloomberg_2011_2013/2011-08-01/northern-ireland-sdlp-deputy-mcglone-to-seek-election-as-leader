Patsy McGlone, deputy leader of the
 Social Democratic & Labour Party , the second-biggest nationalist
party in  Northern Ireland , plans to challenge Margaret Ritchie
for the leadership.  “All those who have spoken to me share the belief that now
is the time for change in the party,” McGlone, a lawmaker in
the region’s power-sharing assembly, said in an e-mailed
statement today. The party’s annual conference, at which
leadership bids can be made, is in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
