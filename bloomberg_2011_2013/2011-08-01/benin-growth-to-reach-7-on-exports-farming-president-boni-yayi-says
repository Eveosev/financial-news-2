Benin ’s economy will reach annual
growth of 7 percent in three years because of investments in
agricultural that are meant to increase exports, said President
Thomas Boni Yayi.  Benin, Africa’s fourth-biggest cotton producer, will set up
an agricultural bank to fund companies in the sector, Boni Yayi
said in a televised speech from Natitingou, 645 kilometers (401
miles) from the commercial capital, Cotonou. He spoke on the
51st anniversary of Benin’s independence from France.  Higher output in agriculture may boost Benin’s economy by
3.8 percent in 2011, from 2.6 percent last year, the
 International Monetary Fund  said July 21. Farming slowed in 2010
after heavy rains caused the worst flooding in 50 years, killing
at least 46 people and leaving 150,000 homeless, according to
the Interior Ministry.  The West African nation will look to neighboring  Nigeria ,
Africa’s most populous country, as an export market for its
goods, Boni Yayi said. A deal signed in 2006 with the U.S.
Millennium Challenge Account for reforms at the port of Cotonou
will “enhance transparency and transaction security,” he said.  Boni Yayi also pledged to improve the country’s roads and
railways, as well as the energy, water and telecommunications
sectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
