Belarus’s trade deficit in goods
widened to $4.5 billion in the first six months, increasing by
26 percent from a year earlier, as imports surged.  Imports rose to $22.7 billion in the period from $14.8
billion last year, the National Statistics Committee said on its
 website  today. Exports grew to $18.2 billion from $11.2 billion.  Sales by Belarusian exporters may gain $3 billion to $5
billion from the ruble’s 36 percent devaluation in May, Economy
Minister Nikolai Snopkov said June 29. The nation, wedged
between European Union member Poland and  Russia , is seeking
financial aid from the  International Monetary Fund  and Russia to
prop up its economy and cope with dwindling currency reserves.  Exports outside the former  Soviet Union  grew 80 percent in
the first six months, compared with a 43 percent increase in
shipments to Russia, the statistics agency said. Russia
accounted for 43 percent of the nation’s trade in the period,
according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
