Porsche AG, the German sports-car
maker that’s merging with  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , said first-half
operating profit surged 59 percent as sales of its 58,000-euro
($84,000) Cayenne sport-utility vehicle more than doubled.  Earnings before interest and taxes rose to 1.07 billion
euros from 675 million euros a year earlier as revenue gained 19
percent to 5.22 billion euros, the Stuttgart-based maker of the
911 sports car said today in a statement.  Backed by VW, Porsche aims to double deliveries to at least
200,000 cars and SUVs by 2018 as it adds new models and expands
in emerging markets. Cayenne volumes surpassed 28,000 in the
first half and the carmaker reiterated that it’s targeting group
sales of more than 100,000 units this year, from 97,000 in 2010.  “Profit and margin are both above expectations,” said
 Juergen Pieper , a Frankfurt-based analyst at Bankhaus Metzler
who recommends buying the stock. “Porsche has excellent products
with the Cayenne and Panamera and the overall environment for
premium cars is very solid.”  China  Surge  Sales rose fastest in China, surging 47 percent to 11,712
 sports-cars  and SUVs. While deliveries of the four-door Panamera
dipped 3.2 percent in the half, they jumped 14 percent in June.  Porsche advanced as much 3.7 percent and was trading 1.7
percent higher at 54.60 euros as of 11:27 a.m. in Frankfurt. The
stock has gained 6.9 percent this year, giving the carmaker a
market value of 16.7 billion euros.  To sustain growth, Porsche aims to adjust rollouts to have
at least one new product a year, sales chief Bernhard Maier said
last month. The key model in 2011 will be the seventh generation
911, which debuts at the  Frankfurt  motor show next month. The
revamped car will be more agile than the current version while
selling for about the same 86,000 euros for the basic model.  The German manufacturer, which relies on the Cayenne for
half of its deliveries, plans to increase production of the
best-selling model by 10 percent to 20 percent starting next
year. Demand for the SUV, which includes a Turbo version costing
121,000 euros, caused the waiting list to extend to as much as
12 months in markets including China.  Rollout Plan  Porsche’s model lineup with the 911, Boxster/Cayman,
Panamera and Cayenne will be expanded by 2013 to include a
compact SUV. In the same year, the company will add a limited
series of the 918 Spyder hybrid, a 500-horsepower vehicle with a
V8 engine and electric motors that has a top speed of 320
kilometers per hour (200 mph).  Porsche may also develop a supercar positioned higher than
the 237,600-euro 911 GT2 RS, which currently marks the top end
of the 911 lineup, Maier said last month. Variants of the Cayman
and Boxster, plus extended-wheelbase and convertible versions of
the Panamera, are also conceivable, the executive said.  Porsche AG Chief Financial Officer Lutz Meschke said today
that the carmaker continues to aim for a “clearly” double-
digit operating margin this year. The company’s operating margin
in the first six months of 2010 was 15.4 percent.  “We were able to finance all investments through our  cash
flow ” Meschke said in the statement. “That’s the result of our
high profit-earning capacity and a very healthy cost structure.”  The company’s European sales rose 11 percent to 18,853
units, with more than one-third -- or 6,734 autos -- delivered
in its German home-market, Porsche said. Sales in  North America 
rose by one-quarter to 15,466 units.  “Porsche is able to benefit through a very attractive
model range from high demand globally for sports cars in the
premium segment,” Chief Executive Officer  Matthias Mueller  said
in the statement.  The Porsche SE holding company, which has its own CEO and
CFO, will report after-tax results for the first half tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
