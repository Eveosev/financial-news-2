The resignations of  Turkey ’s four top
generals July 29 is unlikely to become a major crisis and shows
that Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  is consolidating
civilian control over the country, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said.  “Turkey’s civil society structures are currently being
consolidated, helping to strengthen its democracy,” Goldman
analysts including Ahmet Akarli and Clemens Grafe said in a
research report yesterday.  More protest resignations may follow and vacancies will
quickly be filled by the government, making it unlikely that
“political noise” will turn to a “full blown political
crisis,” the analysts said. “What is happening here is
basically that the ruling party is making it clear that the
army, by constitution, is accountable before the civilian
authorities.”  The latest tensions between Erdogan’s government and the
military will also likely prompt him to kick-start the drafting
of a new constitution, posing numerous challenges and forcing
the ruling party “to finally take a clear stance on a number of
controversial issues, including ethnic and religious rights and
personal liberties,” the report said.  Erdogan’s party lacks a constitutional majority in
parliament, meaning the passage of a new constitution will
require the support of either nationalists or Kurdish
politicians, who will “try and impose their political
priorities” and “ask for compromises that could be difficult
to reconcile,” the Goldman analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
