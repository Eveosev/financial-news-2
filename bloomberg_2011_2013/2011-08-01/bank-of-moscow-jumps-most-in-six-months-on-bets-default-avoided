Bank of Moscow surged the most in
more than two weeks on bets the lender avoided a Eurobond
default after publishing its earnings for 2010.  The shares surged as much as 16 percent before closing 3.7
percent higher at 849.5 rubles at 6:45 p.m. in Moscow, its
biggest gain since July 14.  Bank of Moscow presented its accounts for last year on July
29. Had it failed to do so, the lender may have violated
covenants attached to its Eurobonds, allowing bondholders to
demand immediate repayment, said Rustam Botashev, deputy head of
research at UniCredit SpA.  An agreement by U.S. Congressional leaders to raise
America’s debt ceiling also helped to lift the stock by boosting
demand for emerging-market assets, he said in an e-mailed
comment.  “Two defaults didn’t happen, the U.S. and the Bank of
Moscow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
