South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress  criticized its Youth League as “extremely
thoughtless and embarrassing” for calling for regime change in
 neighboring Botswana  and insulting President Ian Khama.  The ANC Youth League’s threat to destabilize Botswana shows
that it has “clearly crossed the political line,” the ruling
party said in an e-mailed statement today.  Youth League leader  Julius Malema , 30, told reporters
yesterday that Botswana’s government posed a threat to security
in the region because of its close ties to the U.S. The league
has created a team of executive committee members to help
opposition parties in Botswana to defeat the “puppet
government” of Khama, the group said in a statement yesterday.  “The ANC has no policy of effecting regime changes
anywhere in the continent and or in the world, and therefore it
is totally unimaginable that the Youth League of the ANC can
even think of such, let alone lead and put such in the public
domain,” the ANC said.  Botswana is the world’s largest diamond producer and has
Africa’s highest credit rating. Khama was the only leader of the
15-nation  Southern African Development Community  to publicly
reject assertions by Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe  that he
won 2008 elections.  Malema said Botswana was in the process of creating a
“military base of imperialism” in the country. “We cannot
have a neighbor like that,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
