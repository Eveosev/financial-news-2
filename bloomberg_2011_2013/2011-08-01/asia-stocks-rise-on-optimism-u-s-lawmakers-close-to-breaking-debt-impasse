Asian stocks rose, snapping three
days of declines, after U.S. President Barack Obama said
congressional leaders reached an agreement to raise the nation’s
debt ceiling and cut the federal deficit, boosting the outlook
for banks and exporters.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker that
counts  North America  as its biggest market, increased 0.5
percent in  Tokyo . Samsung Electronics Co., the South Korean
television maker that reports “America” is its second-biggest
market for sales, rose 3.1 percent in Seoul.  National Australia
Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the nation’s No. 3 lender by marker value, gained 2
percent in Sydney.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,  Japan ’s
largest listed lender by market value, jumped 4.1 percent after
reporting first quarter profit tripled.  “Investors who were very concerned about the debt-ceiling
negotiations now need to buy back their positions,” said
 Yoshihiro Okumura , who helps manage the equivalent of $365
million at Chiba-Gin Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “There had
been a lot of risk aversion because a default would have meant
that the U.S. government would lose the ability to stimulate the
economy with public spending.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.4 percent to 138.74 as
of 7:30 p.m. in Tokyo. About four shares rose for each that
declined on the gauge. The measure lost 1.6 percent last week
amid concern U.S. lawmakers would be unable to reach an
agreement to raise the nation’s debt ceiling before tomorrow’s
deadline.  U.S. Futures  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average advanced 1.3 percent.
South Korea’s Kospi index rose 1.8 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index increased 1.7 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index
climbed 1 percent, while  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index rose
0.1 percent after swinging between gains and losses.  Singapore’s Straits Times Index gained 0.8 percent as the
stock market started trading without a lunch break today.
India’s Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index climbed 0.6
percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 1.3
percent today, snapping a seven-day losing streak. Obama
announced that leaders of both parties in the U.S. House and
Senate had reached a tentative bipartisan agreement to raise the
debt ceiling, preparing to sell the deal to skeptical
Republicans and Democrats ahead of possible on Aug. 2.  “The leaders of both parties in both chambers have reached
an agreement that will reduce the deficit and avoid default,”
Obama said in a speech from  Washington .  In  New York , the  S&P 500  fell 0.7 percent to 1,292.28 on
July 29 as economic growth trailed forecasts and investors
awaited the outcome of negotiations to avoid a debt default.  Toyota, Honda  Toyota, which receives 28 percent of its revenue from North
America, rose 0.5 percent to 3,170 yen in Tokyo. Honda Motor
Co., which gets 83 percent of its sales from outside Japan,
advanced 1.5 percent to 3,125 yen. Samsung Electronics, which
receives 22 percent of its revenue from America, rose 3.1
percent to 870,000 won.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the largest supplier of
toys and clothes to retailers including Target Corp. and Wal-
Mart Stores Inc., climbed 2.2 percent to HK$13.24.  Banks posted the biggest increase among the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index’s 10 industry groups, providing the greatest
support to the index.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group rose 2.2 percent to
A$21.29, while  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the country’s No.
1 lender, advanced 1.7 percent to A$50.09. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s second-biggest bank by market
value, rose 2.9 percent to 2,505 yen. National Australia Bank
climbed 2 percent to A$24.49.  Government Shutdown Fears  Stocks are gaining because “fears of a partial U.S.
government shutdown or default have been the main worry for
investors recently,” given the potential impact on Asian
exporters, said Sydney-based  Shane Oliver , head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “Nervousness is likely to remain high
as the deal will still have to pass both houses of Congress.”  A gauge of raw-material and energy producers rose at least
1.2 percent. Copper gained to near a more-than-three-month high
on optimism the U.S., the second-largest user of the metal, will
avoid a default. Aluminum and zinc also rose.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company which
counts China as its biggest market for sales, advanced 2.1
percent to A$42.30 in Sydney. Smaller Rio Tinto Group, the
world’s second-largest mining company by sales, advanced 1.9
percent to A$81.52. PetroChina Co. rose 1.6 percent to HK$11.22.  China PMI  A Chinese manufacturing index was higher than economists
estimated in July, signaling the world’s second-biggest economy
is withstanding increased interest rates and tightened credit.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 50.7 for July compared
with 50.9 in June, the China Federation of Logistics and
Purchasing said in a statement today. That was more than every
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 13 economists. The median
estimate was for a reading of 50.2.  Mitsubishi UFJ jumped 4.1 percent to 408 yen, the third-
biggest support to the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The bank rose
after reporting net income tripled to 501 billion yen ($6.5
billion) in the three months ended June 30 from 166 billion yen
a year earlier, as gains from Morgan Stanley preferred shares
outweighed a drop in loan income.  Of 288 companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that have
reported net income from July 11 through 6:15 p.m. in Tokyo
today, 131 have exceeded analysts’ estimates while 94 have
fallen short, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Overall,
earnings declined 11 percent, the data show.  Beating Earnings Estimates  “More and more companies are reporting earnings that
exceed analysts’ estimates or raising profit forecasts, and
that’s bringing a feeling of hope,” said  Kazuhiro Takahashi , a
general manager at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. in
Tokyo.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 0.7 percent this year
through July 29, compared with a gain of 2.8 percent by the S&P
500 and a drop of 3.8 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.4 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the S&P 500
and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Macau casino operators  Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  had
the second-biggest advance on the Asia-Pacific gauge today,
while  Sands China Ltd. (1928)  rose to its highest level since listing
in Hong Kong in November 2009, after casino revenue in the
former Portuguese colony rose 48 percent to 24.2 billion patacas
($3 billion) in July. Galaxy jumped 8.2 percent to HK$21.85 and
Sands China jumped 5.8 percent to HK$24.80.  Itochu Techno-Solutions Corp. (4739) , a computer-network-systems
developer, surged 7.4 percent to 3,270 yen in Tokyo. The company
said it plans to buy back up to 2.89 percent of its outstanding
shares for as much as 5 billion yen, as well as retire 3.1
percent of its shares on Aug. 8.  Among stocks that fell,  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. (6505)  dropped
6.9 percent to NT$101. Chairman Wang Wen-chao and President Su Chi-yi announced their resignations after a fire broke out at a
plant early on July 30.  Formosa Chemicals & Fibre Corp. (1326)  and
 Formosa Plastics Corp. (1301)  also declined. The companies were among
the biggest declining stocks on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
