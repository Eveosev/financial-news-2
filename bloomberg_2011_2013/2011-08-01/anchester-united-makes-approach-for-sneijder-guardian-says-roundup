The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Sneijder Inquiry  Wesley Sneijder  says there is “always a chance” he may
move to  Manchester United  after being sounded out over personal
terms,  the Guardian  reported.  Inter manager Gian Piero Gasperini said the Premier League
champion should be negotiating with Inter first, the Guardian
added.  Sneijder earns almost 250,000 pounds ($411,500) a week and
would cost about 35 million pounds to sign, the Guardian said.  Modric Fee  Chelsea will make a third bid for Luka Modric this week,
improving its offer to 30 million pounds,  the Sun  reported.  The Blues had previous offers of 22 million pounds and 27
million pounds rejected by Tottenham, the Sun said.  Cesc Funds  Barcelona wants Arsenal’s Cesc Fabregas to waive 4 million
pounds to sign for the European champion, the  Daily Mirror 
reported.  Barcelona is putting together a new bid after its previous
offer fell “well short” of Arsenal’s 40 million-pound
valuation, the Mirror said.  Henry Switch  Thierry Henry ’s request to play for former club Arsenal as
well as current team New York Red Bulls in the same game
yesterday was rejected,  The Sun  reported.  Referee Kevin Friend didn’t allow the switch in an
exhibition game because of FIFA rules, the Sun said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
