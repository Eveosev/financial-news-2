Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds
rose relative to benchmark German bunds for the first time in
four days.  The yield on 10-year Spanish bonds fell three basis points
to 6.05 percent as of 7:42 a.m. in  London , reducing the
additional yield investors demand to hold the securities instead
of similar-maturity German bunds by seven basis points to 348
basis points.  The Italian-German yield spread also narrowed seven basis
points, to 326 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
