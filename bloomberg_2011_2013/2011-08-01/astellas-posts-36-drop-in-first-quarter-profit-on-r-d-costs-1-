Astellas Pharma Inc. (4503) ,  Japan â€™s third-
largest drugmaker, said first-quarter profit fell 36 percent
after research and development expenses rose and it incurred a
special loss related to an asset sale.  Net income was 25.1 billion yen ($323 million) in the three
months ended June 30, compared with 39.5 billion yen a year
earlier, Tokyo-based Astellas said in a statement to the Tokyo
Stock Exchange today. Sales increased 5.9 percent to 251.6
billion yen.  Selling, general and administrative costs increased 12
percent to 125.3 billion yen last quarter after Astellas
accounted for development projects and amortization of patents
and goodwill associated with its $3.54 billion takeover of OSI
Pharmaceuticals Inc. last year. R&D costs rose 13 percent to
43.5 billion yen in the period.  Astellas said in May that it expects to return to growth
after lower sales of its best-selling Prograf, used to suppress
rejection in organ transplantation, dragged its profit down last
fiscal year. It is targeting operating profit of 240 billion yen
from sales of 1.1 trillion yen by March 2015 under the new
leadership of Yoshihiko Hatanaka, who replaced Masafumi Nogimori
as chief executive officer in June.  Astellas pared gains in  Tokyo  trading after reporting its
earnings. The shares advanced 0.6 percent to 3,015 yen at 2:29
p.m. local time, while the benchmark Topix index added 1.8
percent.  Astellas reported 3.4 billion yen in one-time charges after
writing down the value of assets following the sale of patents
and associated royalties related to a diabetes medicine in the
drug class known as DPP-IV inhibitors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
