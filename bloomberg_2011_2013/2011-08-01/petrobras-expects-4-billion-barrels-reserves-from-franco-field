State-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4) ’s Franco oil field, acquired from  Brazil ’s government last
year, holds about 4 billion barrels of recoverable oil and
natural gas, Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli said.  In September, Rio de Janeiro-based Petrobras and the
government lowered estimated reserves for Franco to 3.1 billion
barrels from an initial forecast of about 4.5 billion. Gabrielli
spoke today at an event in London.  Last year, Petrobras paid the government $42.5 billion for
the rights to produce 5 billion barrels of oil from Franco and
six other fields in the so-called pre-salt region of the  Santos
Basin . Petrobras plans to invest $12.4 billion over the next
five years to explore and develop those fields.  The company aims to double proved reserves by 2020 as it
develops Franco and other deep-water domestic discoveries.
Petrobras expects to produce 845,000 barrels a day in 2020 from
Franco and other fields it bought last year as part of a $70
billion share sale, the largest in history.  Petrobras rose 0.5 percent, or 12 centavos, to 23.62
reais at 9:54 a.m. New York time. The stock has fallen about 13
percent this year, compared with a 15 percent drop in the
benchmark Bovespa stock index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
