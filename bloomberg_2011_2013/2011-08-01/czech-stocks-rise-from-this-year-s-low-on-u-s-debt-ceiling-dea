Czech stocks pared earlier gains
after a gauge of U.S. manufacturing trailed economists’
forecasts, raising concern the recovery in the world’s largest
economy will slow.  The PX gauge of 14 companies erased most of its 1.3 percent
advance, trading up 0.3 percent to 1,179.2 as of the 4:27 p.m.
close in Prague.  CEZ AS (CEZ) , the country’s biggest power utility
with a 19 percent weighting in the index, slid 0.9 percent to
862 koruna.  Equities tumbled in Europe and America after the  Institute
for Supply Management ’s factory index fell to 50.9 in July from
55.3 a month earlier, missing the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts. The U.S. report outweighed optimism that the
 U.S. Congress  will today approve a debt-limit increase needed to
avert a government default.  To contact the reporter on this story:
