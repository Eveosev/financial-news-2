Brazil ’s trade surplus more than
doubled in July from a year ago, as higher commodity prices
compensated for the impact of a stronger currency that increases
the price of Brazilian goods abroad.  The surplus widened to $3.1 billion last month from $1.3
billion a year ago, the  Trade Ministry  said today on its
website. The figure was lower than the median forecast of $3.8
billion in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  The government slapped a 1 percent tax on currency futures
last week as it seeks to contain the appreciation of the real to
protect local manufacturers from foreign competition. Higher
commodity prices this year offset gains in the currency, helping
increase the 12-month  trade balance  to $27.1 billion, from $17.7
billion a year ago.  The real gained 7.1 percent in the past six months, the
best performer among the seven most-traded Latin American
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. At 10:24 a.m. New York time,
the real traded at 1.5544 per  U.S. dollar , a 0.3 percent decline
from 1.5493 on July 29.  Brazil’s exports rose to $22.3 billion from $17.7 billion a
year ago, while imports increased to $19.1 billion from $16.3
billion, the Trade Ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
