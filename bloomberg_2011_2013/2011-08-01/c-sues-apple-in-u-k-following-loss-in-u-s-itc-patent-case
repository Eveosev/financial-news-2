HTC Corp. (2498) , the Taiwanese smartphone
maker locked in a patent battle with competitor Apple Inc., sued
the iPhone maker in Britain.  The complaint, filed July 29 in London, comes two weeks
after HTC lost a ruling against Apple at the U.S. International
Trade Commission. Notice of the U.K. case didn’t specify the
nature of the new lawsuit.  The Washington-based ITC ruled on July 15 that HTC’s
Android-based mobile phones infringe two Apple patents, a
judgment that HTC, Asia’s second-biggest maker of smartphones,
has said it will appeal.  Apple, based in Cupertino, California, asked the ITC in
March 2010 to block imports of HTC phones, alleging they
infringe patents related to the implementation of operating
systems. HTC last month said it would buy S3 Graphics Co. for
$300 million to boost the legal protection of its products, less
than a week after S3 won an ITC ruling against Apple.  Trudy Muller, an Apple spokeswoman, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment. A spokesman for HTC’s European
unit declined to comment.  The case is HTC Europe Co. v.  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , HC11C02703, in
the  High Court  of Justice,  Chancery Division  (London).  To contact the reporter on this story:
