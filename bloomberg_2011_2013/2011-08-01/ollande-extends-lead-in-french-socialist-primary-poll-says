Francois Hollande  extended his
lead in the campaign to be the French Socialist Party’s
candidate in next year’s presidential elections, a poll showed.  Hollande, a former head of the party, is preferred by
48 percent of Socialist Party sympathizers, the Ifop poll for
France Soir said, ahead of  Martine Aubry  at 36 percent and 2007
candidate Segolene Royal with 9 percent. In the same poll a
month earlier, Hollande led Aubry by 42 to 41 percent.  The Socialists will hold the first round of their primary,
a first in France, on Oct. 9.  The poll questioned 1,956 people from July 21 to 29,
and took the views of 565 who said they tended to vote for
the Socialist Party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
