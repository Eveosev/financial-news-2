(Corrects company name in first paragraph in story first
published July 31.)  The U.K. government may lose 400
million pounds ($657 million) on the sale of Northern Rock Plc,
based on offers by  Richard Branson â€™s Virgin Money Ltd. and the
private equity firm JC Flowers & Co LLC, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Both Virgin Money and JC Flowers have said they could offer
between 900 million pounds and 1 billion pounds, compared with
the 1.4 billion pounds the government spent on the bank when it
was nationalized three years ago, the newspaper said. First-
round bids in the auction for Northern Rock were received last
week, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
