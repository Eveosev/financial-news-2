Botswana, the world’s biggest diamond
producer, plans to cut its  budget deficit  to 6.2 billion pula
($960 million) in the fiscal year through March 2012 as it moves
toward a balanced budget, Finance Minister Kenneth Matambo said.  The gap will probably narrow from 8.5 billion pula in the
2010-11 fiscal year as spending falls, Matambo told reporters in
Gaborone, the capital, today after releasing the government’s
budget strategy.  The southern African nation wants to eliminate its fiscal
deficit by 2012-13 after a decline in demand for diamonds during
the global economic crisis slashed revenue and widened the gap
to about 15 billion pula, or 15 percent of gross domestic
product, in 2009-10. Diamonds generate about 40 percent of
income.  “The reduction in total spending in the coming financial
year and beyond means that the major line items such as
personnel emoluments, transfers to local authorities and public
enterprises will have to decline,” Matambo said.  Government spending  is forecast to drop to 28.5 percent of
GDP in 2012-13 compared with 34.5 percent in 2011-12, he said.  The southern African nation’s economy will probably expand
6.8 percent this year, led by a recovery in demand for diamonds,
he said.  Botswana refused state-worker demands during an eight-week
strike that ended in June for a 12 percent pay increase, saying
it was committed to reducing the deficit. The government
wouldn’t raise its offer of 3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
