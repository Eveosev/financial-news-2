Yuan forwards rose the most in six
weeks after data indicated manufacturing expanded more than
economists forecast in July and Congressional leaders approved a
plan to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 50.7 for July
compared with 50.9 in June, the  China  Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said in a statement today. That exceeded all 13
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. President
 Barack Obama  said leaders of both parties in the U.S. House and
Senate had reached an agreement to raise the $14.3 trillion debt
limit and cut the federal deficit before an Aug. 2 deadline.  “The PMI data came out as better than expected; investors
are hopeful China’s growth won’t slow too much,” said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based senior strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB. “The gains in forwards today are partly related
to relief that a default in the U.S. is likely to be avoided.
That was the main fear of the market.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards appreciated 0.30
percent to 6.3648 per dollar as of 5:24 p.m. in  Hong Kong , a 1.1
percent premium to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan gained 0.04 percent to 6.4340, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.4336 earlier,
the strongest level since the country unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. In the offshore market
in Hong Kong, the currency rose 0.16 percent to 6.4200.  The central bank set the daily fixing 0.07 percent stronger
at a record 6.4399. The currency is allowed to trade 0.5 percent
either side of that rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
