Ghana ’s cedi headed for a more than
five-month high as currency traders reduced holdings of dollars.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
gained as much as 1.4 percent to 1.4915 per dollar, the biggest
intraday gain since Feb. 11, before trading 1.2 percent up at
1.4946 as of 12:52 p.m. in Accra, the capital, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A close at this level will be the highest
since Feb. 18.  “Some dealers sold dollars today just to reduce their
holdings of the U.S. currency,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency
trader at the local unit of Access Bank Plc, said in a telephone
interview today. “As a strategy, sometimes it is better to hold
less of the dollar when you are not sure of the next direction
of rates.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
