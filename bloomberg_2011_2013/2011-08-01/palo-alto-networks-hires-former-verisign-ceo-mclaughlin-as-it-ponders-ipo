Palo Alto Networks Inc. , a security
software company thatâ€™s considering an initial public offering,
has hired Mark McLaughlin as chief executive officer, following
his resignation from  VeriSign Inc. (VRSN)  last week.  McLaughlin will start after his last day at VeriSign on
Aug. 25, said Mike Haro, a spokesman for Palo Alto Networks.
McLaughlin spent more than a decade at VeriSign, a company that
helps manage  Internet traffic , and had been CEO since 2009.  Palo Alto Networks, which competes with Check Point
Software Technologies Ltd.,  Juniper Networks Inc. (JNPR)  and Cisco
Systems Inc., makes a newer kind of firewall software that
determines whether Internet traffic is allowed based on the type
of application generating the traffic. The company has been
cash-flow positive for five quarters and is booking more than
$200 million in orders a year, Haro said.  Based in  Santa Clara ,  California , the 410-person company is
looking to hire 300 people in the fiscal year that starts today.
It was founded by Nir Zuk, who worked at Check Point in the
1990s and developed some of its main firewall technology. The
company is contemplating going public, Haro said, without giving
a time frame.  The Palo Alto Networks board, which started the CEO search
in December, was impressed with McLaughlin because references
said he had a good track record of working with large customers,
particularly in government agencies, an area the company is
targeting for growth, Haro said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
