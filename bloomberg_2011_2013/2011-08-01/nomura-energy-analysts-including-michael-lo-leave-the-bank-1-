Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) â€™s Michael Lo
resigned from the company along with a team of energy analysts.  Lo left the company voluntarily and will start a new job by
November, he said today in a phone interview. He declined to
identify his next employer or discuss other Nomura departures.  In February, Lo predicted  oil prices  may surge to $220 a
barrel if political unrest in North Africa halted exports from
Libya and  Algeria .  Felicity Albert, a Nomura spokeswoman in  Hong Kong , said a
team of energy analysts left the company, declining to give
further details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
