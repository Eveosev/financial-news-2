Cotton rose to a two-week high on
concern that  India , the world’s second-largest producer, won’t
follow through with a plan to boost exports. Orange juice rose.  India yesterday lifted restrictions on exports of raw
cotton, Commerce Secretary Rahul Khullar said in a statement.
Some traders bought the fiber on speculation that supplies will
be blocked, according to  Mike Stevens , an independent trader.
The country’s  Supreme Court  issued a stay on shipments,
Birkenhead, England-based Cotlook Ltd. said on its  website .  “This Indian pattern of an on-again, off-again export
policy has made most international traders quite wary, and
rightfully so,” Stevens said in a telephone interview from
Mandeville, Louisiana.  Cotton for December delivery gained 3.28 cents, or 3.2
percent, to settle at $1.0505 a pound at 2:46 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier, the price touched $1.0532,
the highest since July 14. The fiber reached a record $2.197 on
March 7.  Cotlook’s Memphis, Tennessee, office declined to comment
further. China is the top producer.  Orange-juice  futures for September delivery rose 0.95 cent,
or 0.5 percent, to $2.007 a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
