Czech manufacturing growth slowed for
a third month in July to the weakest level in 1 1/2 years as the
inflow of new orders decelerated, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing Purchasing Managers
Index compiled by Markit slid to 53.4 in July, the lowest level
since January 2010, from 55.1 a month earlier, the bank said in
an e-mailed report.  A PMI reading greater than 50 signals overall growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
