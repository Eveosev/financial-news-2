Gasoline in Chicago strengthened
after  BP Plc (BP) ’s Whiting refinery in Indiana shut a crude unit for
repairs.  The unit is one of the smaller crude units at the 420,000-
barrel-a-day plant, according to a person with knowledge of the
situation.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago narrowed 0.5 cent to 4.25 cents a gallon versus futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 12:39 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery slipped
0.87 cent to $3.0017 a gallon.  Citgo Petroleum Corp. has returned its  Lake Charles ,
Louisiana, refinery to planned rates after maintenance,
according to a company official.  Regular gasoline’s discount in the  Gulf Coast  narrowed 0.1
cent to 9 cents a gallon.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  began restarting the 93,000-barrel-a-
day No. 3 crude unit at its Texas City refinery in Texas after
completing repairs. The unit was shut after a July 13 leak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
