The U.S. Treasury Department
reduced its estimate for  government borrowing  from July to
September to $331 billion, reflecting lower spending.  The current quarter’s borrowing projection is $74 billion
less than estimated three months ago, the department said in a
statement today in  Washington . The Treasury also projected
borrowing of $285 billion from October through December. In the
quarter that ended June 30, the Treasury borrowed $190 billion,
compared with a previous estimate of $142 billion.  The plans, part of the Treasury’s scheduled quarterly
borrowing, coincide with congressional voting today on raising
the $14.3 trillion debt limit after months of debate. The House
plans votes today and the Senate may follow suit to consider an
agreement reached during a weekend of negotiations to raise the
limit by at least $2.1 trillion and to cut  government spending 
by $2.4 trillion or more.  The Treasury’s quarterly debt sales announcement is
scheduled for Aug. 3, pending congressional action. The Treasury
has said it will run out of borrowing authority tomorrow without
congressional action.  In today’s net borrowing needs announcement, the Treasury
said its  forecasts  assume a cash balance of $110 billion for
Sept. 30 and a $100 billion cash balance for the end of
December.  To contact the reporters on this story:
