INA Industrija Nafte d.d., the
refinery controlled by Hungary’s Mol Nyrt., is mulling a  market
regulator ’s request to change its governance system amid a
conflict regarding resumption of share trading.  Croatia ’s largest refiner is “studying the statement” by
the market regulator, or Hanfa, and so far has “no comment,”
spokeswoman Marina Burazer said today in a phone interview.
Hanfa on July 29 said INA should change its rules to prevent the
sharing of privileged business information with Mol before other
investors are notified.  Mol, which secured managing rights in a 2009 contract with
the Croatian government, owns 47.47 percent of INA, with an
option to buy another 1.6 percent. The government holds 44.84
percent.  INA should adapt its regulations in accordance with
Croatian laws within the next 45 days, Hanfa said in a statement
on its website. The regulator also said in a separate statement
on July 29 that the trading suspension of INA stock will
continue until the company complies with the request or a
separate decision is made.  Tensions between the two shareholders increased after Mol
made an offer to purchase the company’s outstanding shares in
December. The government claimed it had not been notified of
Mol’s intention prior to the offer.  INA’s stock has been suspended from trading on the Zagreb
 stock exchange  since April after the market regulator filed
charges against Mol claiming market manipulation in purchasing
INA shares. Mol officials have denied the claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
