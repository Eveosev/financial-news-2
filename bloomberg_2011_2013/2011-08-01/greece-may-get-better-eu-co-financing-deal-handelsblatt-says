European lawmakers may reduce the co-
financing requirement for  Greece  to allow the debt-strapped
country to retrieve money from the region’s structural funds,
Germany’s  Handelsblatt  newspaper reported, citing unidentified
government officials.  Greece’s co-financing requirements may be cut to as low as
5 percent of the overall investment size, the newspaper said.
The Greek government has claimed less than 5 billion euros ($7.2
billion) of the 20.2 billion euros for which it is eligible in
the period to 2013, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
