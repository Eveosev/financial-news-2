The following companies had unusual
price changes in  Mexico  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IPC index declined 0.7 percent to 35,730.71.  America Movil  SAB (AMXL MM), the wireless carrier
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , slipped 1.9 percent to
14.83 pesos after offering to pay about $6.5 billion to buy the
40.4 percent of Telefonos de Mexico SAB it doesn’t already own.  Telefonos de Mexico (TELMEXL MM), Mexico’s largest fixed-
line telephone company, jumped 7.7 percent to 10.22 pesos.  Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, tumbled 3 percent to 8.01 pesos. The  Institute for
Supply Management ’s factory index slumped to 50.9 in July, the
lowest since July 2009, from 55.3 a month earlier, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group said today. Figures less than 50 signal
contraction, and the July index was lower than the most
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Industrias Penoles SAB (PE&OLES* MM), Mexico’s largest
silver producer, retreated 5.1 percent to 480.35 pesos. Silver

$39.04 an ounce on the Comex.  Grupo Elektra SA (ELEKTRA* MM), the retail and banking
company controlled by billionaire  Ricardo Salinas , gained 0.7
percent to 861.24 pesos. Mexican remittances rose 6.9 percent in
June to $2.02 billion from a year earlier, beating forecasts.
Money sent from workers living outside Mexico was forecast to
have totaled $2.01 billion in the period, according to the
median estimate of four economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
