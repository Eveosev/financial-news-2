New Zealand ’s economy probably grew
less than previously forecast in the second quarter, the
Treasury Department said.  Gross domestic product may have expanded 0.5 percent in the
three months ended June 30, less than the 0.8 percent pace
predicted in May’s budget, the Treasury Department said in a
report on its  website . GDP increased 0.8 percent in the first
quarter, more than twice the department’s forecast.  Second-quarter growth will be bolstered by  consumer
spending , manufacturing and exports, although export prices
appear to have peaked, the Treasury said. Prices of lumber and
apples led a second straight monthly decline in commodity export
prices, ANZ National Bank Ltd. said today.  Business confidence measures add to signs of further
economic growth in the second half of the year, the department
said without providing detailed forecasts. The Rugby World Cup
tournament in September and October will add about 0.3
percentage point to growth, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
