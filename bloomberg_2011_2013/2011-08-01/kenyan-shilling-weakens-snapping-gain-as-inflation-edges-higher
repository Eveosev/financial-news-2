Kenya ’s shilling weakened, snapping a
July 29 gain that increased demand for dollars.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
0.1 percent to 91.10 per dollar at 12:04 p.m. in Nairobi,
Kenya’s capital from a close of 91.00 on July 29.  “The shilling has weakened due to increased demand after
it had strengthened to the 90 level,” Wilson Mutai, a dealer at
Nairobi-based Africa Banking Corp., said in a phone interview.
The bank expects the shilling to trade at 90.70 to 91.50 in
coming days, he said.  Kenyan inflation accelerated for the ninth straight month
in July, pushed by rising cost of food and fuel.  Prices climbed 15.5 percent from the year earlier, compared
with 14.5 percent in June, the Kenya National Bureau of
Statistics said in an e-mailed statement today. Prices rose 1.27
percent in the month.  The central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee left the
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 6.25 percent at its last
meeting on July 27, following two consecutive increases, saying
tighter monetary policy won’t reduce supply side price
pressures. Food costs are rising because of a regional drought,
while higher  oil prices  are pushing up transport costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
