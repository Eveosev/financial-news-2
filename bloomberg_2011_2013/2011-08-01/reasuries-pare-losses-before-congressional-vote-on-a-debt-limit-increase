Treasuries advanced, pushing the
yields on 10-year notes to the lowest level since November, as
an index showed U.S. manufacturing expanded in July at the
slowest pace in two years.  U.S. debt rallied as congressional leaders prepared a vote
to reduce  government spending  and raise the debt limit,
curtailing the risk of a default. The difference between the
yields on two- and 10-year notes decreased to 2.36 percentage
points, the narrowest since December 2010.  “We’ve turned from  budget crisis  to economic crisis,”
said Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition Asiel
Securities Inc., an interdealer broker. “We’ve gone from
worrying about a budget and default to the economy long term.
Higher prices are bringing in buyers, not sellers.”  Yields on benchmark 10-year notes fell five basis points,
or 0.05 percentage point, to 2.74 percent at 5:02 p.m. in New
York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.125
percent securities due in May 2021 gained 14/32, or $4.38 per
$1,000 face amount, to 103 8/32.  The 10-year note yields touched 2.72 percent, the lowest
level since Nov. 12, 2010. Yields on two-year notes gained one
basis point to 0.37 percent after falling to 0.34 percent, the
lowest level since July 12. Credit-default swaps on  U.S. debt 
dropped today to 54 from 62, according to CMA.  Debt Votes  The Treasury Department has said it will breach the $14.3
trillion borrowing limit and run out of options for avoiding
default tomorrow without action by Congress to raise the debt
ceiling. The House plans votes today and the Senate may follow
suit to consider the agreement reached during a weekend of
negotiations that capped a months-long struggle between Obama
and Republicans.  The U.S. still faces the threat of a credit-rating
downgrade, said  Peter Fisher , head of fixed income in New York
at BlackRock Inc., in an interview on Bloomberg Television.  “Politicians went too far with the threat of default,”
Fisher said. Even with the pending agreement, the U.S. remains
“right on the cusp” of a downgrade, he said.  Standard & Poor’s  placed the U.S. AAA rating on
“CreditWatch” July 14, saying there’s a 50 percent chance it
would be cut within 90 days even if an agreement is reached by
the deadline. S&P said it needs to see “a credible solution to
the rising U.S. government debt burden.”  Bill Rates  Rates on the $90 billion in six-month bills due Aug. 4
dropped today to 0.19 percent. The rate rose to 0.3 percent on
July 29, the highest since they were issued in February,
signaling investors were concerned Congress wouldn’t raise the
debt ceiling by the deadline.  At an auction today, the U.S. Treasury Department sold $27
billion in three-month bills at a rate of 0.115 percent, the
highest since February. Investors bid for 4.51 times the amount
of securities offered, the highest since July 5. The Treasury
also sold $24 billion in six-month bills at a rate of 0.15
percent, the highest since March. Investors bid for 4.82 times
the amount offered, the most since July 11.  Rates for borrowing and lending Treasuries in the
repurchase-agreement market rose to a two-year high. The average
level of overnight Treasury general collateral repo rates traded
through 10 a.m. New York time with ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
inter-dealer broker, was 0.32 percent today, up from 0.21
percent at the same time on July 29 and the highest since March
2, 2009.  Borrowing Plans  The Treasury Department reduced its estimate for  government
borrowing  from July to September to $331 billion, reflecting
lower spending.  The current quarter’s borrowing projection is $74 billion
less than estimated three months ago, the department said in a
statement today in  Washington . The Treasury also projected
borrowing of $285 billion from October through December. In the
quarter that ended June 30, the Treasury borrowed $190 billion,
compared with a previous estimate of $142 billion.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s factory index fell in
July to 50.9, the lowest since July 2009, from 55.3 in the
previous month. The median forecast of 80 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a decrease to 54.5.  Jobs Report  An Aug. 5 report from the Labor Department may show U.S.
payrolls added 85,000 jobs in July, compared with 18,000 in the
previous month, according to the median forecast of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey.  “All eyes will be on the jobs situation come Friday,”
said  Ian Lyngen , a government bond strategist at CRT Capital
Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Fed funds futures indicated an 9.2 percent chance the U.S.
central bank will raise its target rate for overnight lending
between banks by year-end, down from a 13.2 percent probability
a month ago. The fed funds target has stayed at zero to 0.25
percent since December 2008.  Treasury yields average 0.72 percentage point less than the
rest of the world’s sovereign-debt markets, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes show. The difference has expanded from
0.15 percentage point in January.  “There is no other country that can step in and replace
the U.S. at the core of the system,” said Mohamed El-Erian, the
chief executive officer at  Newport Beach , California-based
Pacific Investment Management Co., which manages the world’s
largest bond fund, in a July 25 interview on Bloomberg
Television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
