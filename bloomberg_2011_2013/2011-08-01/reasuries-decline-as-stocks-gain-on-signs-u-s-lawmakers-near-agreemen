Treasuries fell the most in more than
a week after congressional leaders approved a plan to raise the
debt ceiling, boosting stocks and ending a stalemate over U.S.
government borrowing that threatened to result in a default.  Yields on 10-year debt rose from the lowest this year as
lawmakers said an agreement was near and President  Barack Obama 
went on to announce the pact on television late yesterday in
 Washington . A Chinese manufacturing index for July was higher
than economists estimated, fueling optimism that the world’s
second-largest economy will help drive global growth.  “Treasuries received a lot of support last week,” said
 Peter Chatwell , a fixed-income strategist in London at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank. “Now that there seems to
be an agreement on the table, that flight to quality is
diminishing. Investors are feeling a little more bullish, which
is benefiting stocks and reducing demand for safe havens like
bunds and Treasuries.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note climbed four basis
points to 2.83 percent as of 6:24 a.m. in  New York , according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The security yielded 2.77 percent
at the end of last week, the least since Nov. 30. The 3.125
percent note due in May 2021 slid 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000
face amount, to 102 15/32.  Yields on two-year notes added two basis points to 0.38
percent while five-year yields increased four basis points to
1.39 percent. Thirty-year bonds yielded 4.17 percent, five basis
points more than their previous close.  ‘Appetite for Risk’  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of shares snapped a three-day
decline, gaining 1.4 percent, while futures on the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index added 1.3 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
rose 0.7 percent.  Ten-year yields will increase to 3.55 percent by year-end,
according to a Bloomberg survey of banks and securities
companies.  “There’s an increased appetite for risk,” said Roger Bridges, who oversees the equivalent of $16.6 billion of debt as
Sydney-based head of bonds at Tyndall Investment Management
Ltd., a unit of  Japan ’s Nikko Asset Management Co. “Yields
under 3 percent look expensive. They should be higher.”  Ten-year notes yield negative 71 basis points after
accounting for inflation. The rate was negative 76 basis points
on July 29, the least since October 2008.  Yield Spread  Obama warned July 25 of a “deep economic crisis” without
a compromise over the budget. Congressional leaders are racing
to push through a plan to raise the debt limit by at least $2.1
trillion and slash  government spending  by a minimum $2.4
trillion before a default threatened for as early as tomorrow.
The House plans votes today and the Senate may follow suit.  The spread between two- and 10-year yields expanded to 2.45
percentage points, the first time in five days that the yield
gap has widened. The average rate for borrowing and lending
Treasuries for one day in the repurchase-agreement market was 21
basis points, the highest level since Feb. 1, according to index
data provided by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.  Japan’s 10-year yield was little changed at 1.08 percent
after falling to this year’s low of 1.06 percent on July 19. The
Ministry of Finance is scheduled to sell 2.2 trillion yen ($28.3
billion) of the securities tomorrow.  Yields on 10-year German bunds increased four basis points
to 2.58 percent after falling for each of the previous six
trading days.  The U.S. probably failed to create enough jobs in July to
cut unemployment, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists before the Labor Department’s employment report on
Aug. 5. Industry figures today will show U.S. manufacturing
growth slowed last month, a separate survey showed.  China Manufacturing  Treasury investors became less bearish on their outlook for
 U.S. debt  through year-end, according to a survey of money
managers by Ried Thunberg ICAP Inc., the New Jersey-based unit
of the world’s largest interdealer broker. The company’s
sentiment index rose to 43 for the seven days ended July 29 from
42 the week before. A figure less than 50 indicates investors
expect prices to fall.  Chinese data indicated Premier  Wen Jiabao ’s campaign to
tame prices isn’t slowing the economic expansion and the nation
is maintaining its contribution to global growth.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 50.7 for July
compared with 50.9 in June, the  China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing  said in a statement. The reading was more than
every forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 13 economists.  Investors from  China  to the U.K. were willing to lend money
to the U.S. in July at the lowest rates of the year even as
lawmakers debated how to raise the debt limit. For many, there
are few non-U.S. alternatives, no matter what its  credit rating .  Reserve Currency  Status  Treasury yields average 0.72 percentage point less than the
rest of the world’s sovereign debt markets, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes show. The difference has expanded from
0.15 percentage point in January. The dollar saw higher-than-
average net inflows last week compared with the previous year,
according to Bank of New York Mellon, which is the custodian for
more than $20 trillion.  “There is no other country that can step in and replace
the U.S. at the core of the system,” Mohamed El-Erian, the
chief executive officer at  Newport Beach , California-based
Pacific Investment Management Co., which manages the world’s
largest bond fund, said July 25 in an interview on Bloomberg
Television. “The U.S. is the supplier of the reserve
currency.”  CUSIPS and due dates of U.S. debt due in August
