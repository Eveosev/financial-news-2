Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, said it will shutter its
banking unit after the collapse of a deal to sell deposits to
 Discover Financial Services. (DFS)   “We are continuing with plans to wind down the Allstate
Bank’s operations and anticipate obtaining regulatory approval
to cancel its banking charter by year-end 2011,” Allstate said
today in a regulatory filing.  MetLife Inc. (MET)  and Northbrook, Illinois-based Allstate are
among insurers scaling back deposit-gathering operations as
regulators increase oversight of banks. Allstate Chief Executive
Officer  Thomas Wilson  said in February that the company was
facing additional Federal Reserve requirements on debt-to-equity
levels and overall risk management that would create “potential
conflict” with existing oversight.  Allstate Bank had about $1.06 billion in deposits as of
March 31, according to data on the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. website. The insurer today said it had costs of $21
million this year through June 30 related to the planned
dissolution of the bank.  “Due to the complex and changing regulatory environment,
the approvals needed were not obtained by the agreed upon date”
to complete the transaction, Allstate said today in an e-mailed
statement. The firms also cancelled a marketing and distribution
agreement that was announced with the planned sale.  Laura Gingiss, a spokeswoman for Riverwoods, Illinois-based
Discover, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
