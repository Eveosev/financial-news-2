U.K.  government bonds  declined and
the pound rose against the yen and franc as demand for riskier
assets rose on optimism that U.S. lawmakers will approve a deal
to raise the nation’s debt ceiling and avert default.  Ten-year gilts snapped a three-day advance. The U.S. deal
reached last night will raise the debt limit by at least $2.1
trillion and slash  government spending  by $2.4 trillion or more.
The  House of Representatives  plans votes today and the Senate
may follow.  “The market is optimistic that what on Friday appeared to
be an imminent default seems to be averted for now, and hence
there’s a rally in risk assets,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed
income strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. in Edinburgh.
“It’s still unclear what will happen to the U.S. credit rating.
But for the time being, this should take some shine off
government bonds, including gilts.”  The yield on 10-year gilts rose four basis points to 2.90
percent at 10:20 a.m. in  London , after falling 25 basis points
last week, the biggest weekly decline since March 2009. The 3.75
percent security maturing in September 2020 fell 0.360, or 3.60
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,643) face amount, to 106.735. Two-
year yields advanced two basis points to 0.65 percent.  Gilts beat their German and U.S. counterparts this year,
handing investors a 5.4 percent return, compared with a 2.9
percent gain from German debt and a 4.3 percent return from
Treasuries, according to the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.  U.K. Data  The pound rose 0.6 percent against the franc to $1.2986
after reaching $1.3092. It gained 0.8 percent to 127.19 yen
after falling in the previous three sessions. It was little
changed at 87.67 pence per euro and $1.6425.  Congressional leaders, leaving no extra time before a
default threatened for tomorrow, are racing to push through a
compromise sealed with President  Barack Obama  last night after a
weekend of negotiations that capped a months-long struggle over
raising the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling.  Gilts pared their decline and the pound dipped versus the
dollar after a measure of manufacturing activity missed
economists’ estimates. A gauge based on a survey by  Markit
Economics  and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply 
shrank to 49.1 in July, the lowest since June 2009, according to
an e-mailed report today. That was worse than the median
forecast of 51 from 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The  Confederation of British Industry  cut its growth
forecast for the U.K. economy after gross domestic product
barely grew in the second quarter. The U.K. will grow 1.3
percent this year, compared with an estimate of 1.7 percent in
May, the country’s biggest employers’ group said in a quarterly
forecast released in London today. The CBI’s growth prediction
for 2012 is unchanged at 2.2 percent.  Halifax, the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc, may
say this week that  house prices  were stagnant in July, according
to a separate survey.  Sterling has fallen 8.2 percent in the last 12 months,
making it the second-worst performer among 10 developed-market
currencies after the  U.S. dollar , according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
