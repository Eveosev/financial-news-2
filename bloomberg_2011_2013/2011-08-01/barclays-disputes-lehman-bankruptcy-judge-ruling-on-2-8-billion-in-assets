  Barclays Plc (BARC) , which appealed a court
order to return $2 billion in margin assets to  Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) ’s bankrupt brokerage, asked a federal district
judge to decide whether U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck also
erred in ruling that the U.K. bank had “only a conditional
right” to $769 million in securities in a reserve account, or
similar assets, according to a July 29 filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
