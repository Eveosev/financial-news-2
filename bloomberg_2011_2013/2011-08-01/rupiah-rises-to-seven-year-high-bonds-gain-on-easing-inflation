(Corrects bond yield in last paragraph.)  Indonesia ’s rupiah climbed to a
seven-year high and bonds gained for a fifth day as a report
today showed the slowest inflation in more than a year.  Consumer prices in Southeast Asia’s largest economy rose
4.6 percent in July from a year earlier, compared with an
increase of 5.54 percent the previous month, the  Central Bureau
of Statistics  said in Jakarta today. U.S. President  Barack Obama 
said that leaders of both parties in the House and Senate had
approved an agreement to raise the U.S.’s debt ceiling.  “Inflation is not too fast and it can be managed below 5
percent,” said Iwan Ridwan Gunandar, a foreign-exchange trader
at PT CIMB Bank Niaga in Jakarta. “With the problems on the U.S.
deficit, people prefer to change their portfolio into Asian
currencies.”  The rupiah rose 0.5 percent to 8,463 per dollar as of 4:20
p.m. in Jakarta, the strongest level since March 2004, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Overseas investors have bought $2.7 billion more Indonesian
shares than they sold this year, according to exchange data, and
raised their holdings of the country’s sovereign bonds by 26
percent to 247.51 trillion rupiah ($29.2 billion), data from the
debt management office show.  The yield on the 8.25 percent note due July 2021 fell six
basis points to 6.971 percent, the lowest yield since the notes
were issued, according to closing prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association. The price advanced 0.4550, or 4,550 rupiah
per 1 million rupiah face amount, to 109.064.  To contact the reporter on this story:
