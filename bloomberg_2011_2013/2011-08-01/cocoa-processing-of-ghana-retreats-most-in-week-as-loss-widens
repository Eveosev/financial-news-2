Cocoa Processing Co., a Ghanaian
chocolate maker, dropped the most in almost a week, after saying
losses widened during the nine months through June.  The shares fell 1 pesewa, or 33 percent, to 2 pesewas, as
of 10:37 a.m. in the capital, Accra, the steepest decline since
July 26.  CPCâ€™s nine-month loss increased to 9.9 million cedis ($6.6
million), from a loss of 5.9 million cedis a year earlier, the
company said in a statement published in the Accra-based Daily
Graphic newspaper today. Revenue for the period slipped to 60.5
million cedis from 67.4 million cedis, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
