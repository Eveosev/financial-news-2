Hines and New York State Common
Retirement Fund said they will invest more than $1 billion in
U.S. office and medical buildings amid a recovery in commercial
property prices.  The Houston-based real estate firm and the New York
pension, the nation’s third-largest plan, formed a joint venture
to develop, acquire, own and manage buildings primarily occupied
by a single tenant, Hines said today in a statement. The
partnership will be funded with $500 million in equity.  Hines and the pension formed a similar venture that
developed about 3 million square feet (280,000 square meters) of
offices from 1997 to 2004. U.S. commercial property values
increased in May for the first time in six months, rising 6.3
percent from April, according to the Moody’s/REAL Commercial
Property Price Index.  “The timing is right to reconstitute this venture and
strategy,” Hines Chief Executive Officer Jeff Hines said in the
statement.  The Moody’s index, which tracks repeat deals including
distressed sales, is down 11 percent from a year earlier and 46
percent from the October 2007 peak. Green Street Advisors Inc.’s
property-price gauge showed commercial values little changed in
June from the previous month and up 20 percent from a year
earlier. Prices are down 10 percent from their peak, according
to the  Newport Beach , California-based research company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
