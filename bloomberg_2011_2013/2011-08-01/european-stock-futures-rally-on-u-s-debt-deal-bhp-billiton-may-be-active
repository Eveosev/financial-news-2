European stocks dropped to an eight-
month low after a report showed U.S. manufacturing expanded at
the slowest pace in two years as lawmakers prepared to vote on a
proposal to raise the nation’s debt limit.  Italy ’s  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP)  led banks lower. Ferrovial SA
paced a decline in construction shares, losing 4.5 percent.
Veolia Environnement SA, the world’s biggest water utility,
slumped to the lowest level in eight years.  Outotec Oyj (OTE1V)  sank 10
percent after Danske Bank A/S downgraded the Finnish company.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index dropped 1.2 percent to 262.02 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London after earlier rallying as much as
1.2 percent. The measure has tumbled 10 percent from this year’s
high in February amid speculation the European debt crisis is
spreading and concern that Republicans and Democrats will fail
to agree on a deal to raise the U.S. debt ceiling before
tomorrow’s deadline. A drop of that size from the most recent
peak is known as a correction by analysts.  “Macroeconomic data are bad and company earnings aren’t
good either,” said Jacques-Pascal Porta, who helps oversee $400
million at Paris-based investment firm Ofi Gestion Privee. “The
agreement on the U.S. debt ceiling itself isn’t that great and
the risk that the U.S. may lose its AAA rating is the Sword of
Damocles hanging over the markets.”  Profits Trail  Profits at European companies are trailing estimates by the
most in at least five years, dragged down by manufacturing
shares that had been forecast to lead a rally in the second half
of the year. About 52 percent of companies in the Stoxx 600 that
have reported earnings since July 11 missed analysts’
projections, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Manufacturing in the world’s largest economy expanded in
July at the slowest pace since 2009 as new orders shrank and
production eased. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.
factory index fell to 50.9 from 55.3 in June. Economists had
projected a drop to 54.5, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  Stocks in Europe initially rallied after President  Barack
Obama  said U.S. lawmakers had reached agreement on raising the
nation’s debt limit. The House planned to vote on the proposal
today and the Senate may follow.  Both  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service are
weighing whether to cut the U.S. credit rating. The debt-ceiling
impasse boosted to 50 percent the chance that S&P will downgrade
the U.S. from AAA within three months, the ratings company said
last month.  ‘Biggest Threat’  A downgrade of U.S. credit rating “will not be the end of
the world as there is no other credible alternative as to risk
free debt,” said Stephane Ekolo, chief European strategist at
Market Securities in  London . “Therefore, it is not unsurprising
that investors are looking into euro-zone debt believing this is
where the biggest threat remains.”  Italian and Spanish bonds dropped, reversing an earlier
advance. The yield on 10-year Italian bonds rose 14 basis points
to 6.01 percent and yields on similar-maturity Spanish debt
climbed 11 basis points to 6.19 percent.  National benchmark indexes dropped in all 16 western
European markets that were open today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 slid
0.7 percent,  Germany ’s DAX dropped 2.9 percent and  France ’s CAC
40 declined 2.3 percent.  Spain ’s IBEX 35 tumbled 3.2 percent and
Italy’s FTSE MIB fell 3.9 percent to the lowest level since
April 2009.  Banks Drop  Italian and Spanish banks led the benchmark Stoxx 600 lower
amid concern the debt crisis may spread beyond  Greece  to Spain
and Italy. The  International Monetary Fund  warned last week that
Spain was still in the “danger zone” and must keep up momentum
in restructuring its economy to stave off contagion.  Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy’s second-biggest lender, dropped 7.9
percent to 1.49 euros in Milan while UBI Banca SpA slid 7.9
percent to 3.09 euros.  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  retreated 3.8 percent
to 6.94 euros in  Madrid  while Banco Popular Espanol SA lost 5
percent to 3.43 euros.  Spanish builders also retreated, led by Ferrovial, which
fell 4.5 percent to 8.50 euros and Fomento de Construcciones &
Contratas SA, which lost 4.3 percent to 18.35 euros.  Spain’s opposition  People’s Party  pledged to restore
investor trust in the euro area’s fourth-biggest economy by
imposing more spending cuts if it wins early elections in
November as polls suggest it will.  Veolia Environment slid 5.3 percent to 14.97 euros, the
lowest price since April 2003. Utility shares plummeted 2.5
percent today, the second-worst performance among 19 industry
groups in the Stoxx 600.  Outotec, HSBC  Outotec sank 10 percent to 30.88 euros in Helsinki, its
biggest drop since 2008, as the Finnish supplier of technology
and services to mining companies was downgraded to “sell” from
“hold” at Danske Bank.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  limited losses in the Stoxx 600, rising
2.2 percent to 607.5 pence. Europe’s biggest bank reported
first-half earnings of $9.22 billion, beating analyst estimates
of $7.82 billion, and said it will cut 30,000 jobs as part of a
plan to reduce costs by as much as $3.5 billion over the next
two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
