Tele Norte Leste Participacoes SA (TNLP3)  and
 Telemar Norte Leste SA (TMAR5)  advanced in Sao Paulo trading, while
 Brasil Telecom SA (BRTO4)  tumbled after they released details of a plan
to merge into a single entity.  Tele Norte Leste common shares jumped 4.4 percent to 25
reais at the close of trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time, the
best performance on the Bovespa index. Preferred shares of
Telemar climbed 1.7 percent to 45.50 reais. Brasil Telecom
tumbled 2.8 percent to 12.75 reais.  Brazil ’s benchmark equity
gauge fell 0.5 percent.  Parent company Telemar Participacoes SA said on May 24 it
plans to merge its three units into one entity that will be
Brazil’s largest fixed-line telephone service provider. The
companies set the ratio prices for the restructuring today.  “It seems like investors are saying that the ratio
proposed isn’t very good for Brasil Telecom shareholders,”
Rosangela Ribeiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora in  Sao Paulo ,
said in a telephone interview.  Each Tele Norte common shareholder will receive 2.3122
Brasil Telecom common shares, according to the proposal
announced today. Tele Norte Leste Participacoes’s preferred
stock will be exchanged for 2.1428 Brasil Telecom preferred
shares and 1.8581 Brasil Telecom common shares, according to a
statement from the companies.  Each Telemar Norte common share will be exchanged for
5.1149 of Brasil Telecom’s similar stocks. Telemar Norte Leste’s
