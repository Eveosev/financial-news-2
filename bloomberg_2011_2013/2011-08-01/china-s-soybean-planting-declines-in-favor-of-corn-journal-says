China ’s farmers significantly reduced
the planting of soybeans this year to sow more corn and rice,
the  China Business Journal  reported, citing a study by the
National Development and Reform Commission.  In the northeast grain belt, acreage planted to soybeans
declined by 14 million mu (933,333 hectares) from last year, the
newspaper said, without stating last year’s figures. Corn and
rice output may gain on increased planting, yields and favorable
weather, it said, citing the commission’s Deputy Director of
Agricultural Economy Fang Yan.  Still, corn supply may be tight as the government seeks to
boost stockpiles, competing with private industry for the
harvest, the newspaper said, citing a trader it didn’t identify.
State reserves sold 20 million metric tons of corn at the
beginning of this year to cool prices, and it has bought back
only 10 million tons, the newspaper said, citing an unidentified
official at a state-owned trading company.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
