Investors should buy “high-quality”
industrial stocks that rely most on U.S. revenue because the
group should perform better than the broad market in coming
years, Oppenheimer & Co. said.  Oppenheimer screened for stocks using criteria including
less than 50 percent of revenue from outside the U.S., a price-
earnings ratio of less than 15 times forecast profit and
earnings-per-share growth estimates higher than 10 percent for
2011 and 2012. It found 11 stocks, including delivery companies
 FedEx Corp. (FDX)  and  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , power-tool producer
 Stanley Black & Decker Inc. (SWK)  and security-systems maker  Tyco
International Ltd. (TYC)   “Despite the sector’s poor performance in recent months,
we continue to believe that industrials remain well-positioned
to provide leadership in the coming years,”  Brian Belski , the
New York-based chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, said
in a note dated today. Industrials offer “opportunities even
during challenging market environments,” he said, and investors
should focus on “high-quality and defensive companies.”  A gauge of industrial companies in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index has declined 1.8 percent in 2011 as of 1:45 p.m. in
New York, compared with a 1.8 percent gain for the broad
measure. U.S. manufacturing expanded in July at the slowest pace
in two years,  with today’s  Institute for Supply Management ’s
factory index falling to 50.9 last month from 55.3 in June.
Economists projected the index would drop to 54.5, according to
a Bloomberg survey.  Belski forecasts the  S&P 500  will rise to 1,325 at the end
of 2011, less than the average estimate of 13 strategists
surveyed by Bloomberg who predict a year-end close of 1,401.  To contact the reporter on this story:
