Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of
 Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, may say second-quarter profit rose as the
lender set aside less money for bad loans.  Net income for the three months ended June 30 probably was
3.36 billion koruna ($200 million) compared with 3.27 billion
koruna a year earlier, according to the median estimate of five
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey. The Prague-based lender is
due to report results on August 3.  Loan-loss provisions probably fell 31.8 percent to 555
million koruna in the second quarter from a year ago, J&T Banka
analyst Milan Lavicka wrote in a report published on Bloomberg
on July 29. Net interest income, Komercni’s most important
revenue source, may have risen 2.4 percent to 5.54 billion
koruna, Lavicka wrote.  Komercni Banka has been increasing investment into
personnel, development and implementation of new products and
refurbishing and opening new branches. The lender said in
February full-year costs will grow faster than revenue this
year.  Czech banks have been benefiting from a decline in bad
corporate loans and economic growth estimated by the central
bank at 1.5 percent in 2011. Komercni’s rival Erste Group Bank
AG’s Ceska Sporitelna AS reported a 24 percent increase in
profit last week.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
