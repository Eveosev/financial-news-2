TNT Express NV, Europe’s second-
largest express delivery service, reported an 85 percent drop in
second-quarter profit on losses in Brazil and Asia.  Net income fell to 4 million euros ($5.8 million) from 26
million euros a year earlier, the Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based
company said in a statement today. Earnings before interest and
taxes excluding one-off items and currency fluctuations declined
8.1 percent to 79 million euros, beating the 77 million-euro
average estimate of 8 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Demand from Asia to Europe has been volatile, and we are
optimizing our capacity accordingly,” Chief Executive Officer
Marie-Christine Lombard said in the statement. “The turnaround
in Brazil is on track,” though the short term will be
“challenging.”  TNT Express rose as much as 55 cents, or 7.8 percent, and
was up 3.6 percent at 7.31 euros at 9:11 a.m. in Amsterdam,
valuing the company at 3.96 billion euros.  The express company has been coping with losses in Brazil
and took a non-cash charge of 120 million euros related to
restructuring its operations there in the first quarter. The
company said today that it is sticking to its goal to turn
around the unit by the second half of 2012.  On May 25, shareholders of TNT, which has been renamed
PostNL NV, approved the spinoff of the express business, which
competes with larger rival DHL, a division of Deutsche Post AG.
The Dutch postal company has pledged to retain a 29.9 percent
holding of TNT Express for at least six months unless the new
company’s board receives and agrees to a takeover offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
