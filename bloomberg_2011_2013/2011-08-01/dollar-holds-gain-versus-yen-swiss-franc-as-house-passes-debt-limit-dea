The dollar maintained earlier gains
versus the yen and the Swiss franc after the House approved
legislation to raise the U.S. debt limit by at least $2.1
trillion and cut federal spending by $2.4 trillion or more,
averting a threatened default.  The U.S. currency climbed to 77.42 yen as of 8:10 a.m. in
 Tokyo  from 77.21 yesterday in  New York , and advanced 0.3 percent
to 78.55 Swiss centimes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
