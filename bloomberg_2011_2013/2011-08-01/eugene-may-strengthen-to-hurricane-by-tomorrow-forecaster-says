Tropical Storm  Eugene , the fifth
named storm of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season, may
strengthen to become a hurricane by tomorrow, according to the
U.S. National Hurricane Center.  The storm is moving west-northwestward over open waters
about 420 miles (676 kilometers) south-southwest of Acapulco,
 Mexico , at 10 miles per hour, the center said in an  advisory 
issued at 11 p.m. Miami time yesterday. Eugene is packing
maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, below the minimum 74-mph
speed of a Category One hurricane, based on the  Saffir-Simpson
scale .  “Gradual strengthening is forecast during the next 48
hours,” the Miami-based center said. “There are no coastal
watches or warnings in effect.”  A weather system becomes a tropical storm when it develops
cyclone characteristics, and becomes a named storm when winds
reach at least 39 mph. There is no tropical cyclone in the
Atlantic and  Caribbean Sea  currently and the next update for the
Eastern Pacific will be at 5 a.m. Miami time, the hurricane
center said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
