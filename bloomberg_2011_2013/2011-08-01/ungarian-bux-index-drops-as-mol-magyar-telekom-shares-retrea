Hungary ’s benchmark stock tumbled the
most in two weeks, extending its decline after a gauge of U.S.
manufacturing trailed economists’ forecasts, raising concern the
recovery in the world’s largest economy will slow.  The BUX equity gauge slid 2.2 percent to 21,133.02 by the
5:06 p.m. close in Budapest, its biggest one-day retreat since
July 18. Mol Nyrt., Hungary’s largest oil company, declined 2
percent and OTP Bank Nyrt., the biggest lender, lost 3.7
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
