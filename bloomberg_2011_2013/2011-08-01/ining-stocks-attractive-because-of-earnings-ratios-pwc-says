Mining stocks are “attractive”
compared with other industries because share prices have failed
to reflect rising earnings, according to a
PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  “The market still does not seem to price in the ability of
mining sector participants to increase earnings levels,” PwC
said in the report. “Mining-sector PE ratios still look
attractive compared to the wider market, suggesting that mining
stocks are not overvalued at present.”  PwC said mining companies’ shares traded at 8.5 times
profit compared with 13.7 times for the wider market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
