Solar Millennium AG (S2M)  and Spanish
builder  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL)  sold 49 percent of the Arenales
solar-thermal power plant project to a fund managed by  Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) ’s RREEF unit.  The 50-megawatt plant, to be built in southern Spain, will
supply enough electricity for 150,000 people starting in 2013,
Erlangen, Germany-based Solar Millennium said in a statement
today. The project also got bank loans for about 75 percent of
the construction and investment costs, with the rest to be
funded by its shareholders, the company said.  “Because of the considerable debt ratio, we’re able to
finance our equity ratio without the emission of funds from our
own resources,” Solar Millennium Chief Executive Officer
Christoph Wolff said in the statement. “We’re also not ruling
out the possibility of a sale of additional project shares.”  Solar Millennium and OHL now hold 26 and 25 percent in the
project, respectively, after taking it over from Spanish solar
developer Fotowatio SL in April. The value of the RREEF
transaction wasn’t disclosed.  Arenales is one of five Solar Millennium solar-thermal
plants in  Spain , two of which are connected to the grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
