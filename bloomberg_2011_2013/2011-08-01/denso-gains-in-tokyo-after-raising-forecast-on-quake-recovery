Denso Corp., Japan’s biggest car
parts maker, gained the most in more than two months in  Tokyo 
trading after raising its half-year profit forecast on faster-
than-expected recovery from the March 11 earthquake.  The shares climbed as much as 3.5 percent to 2,850 yen, the
biggest intraday advance since May 12, before trading at 2,834
yen as of 1:17 p.m. in Tokyo. The stock has dropped 2.4 percent
since March 10, the day before the quake.  Denso, 23 percent owned by Toyota Motor Corp., is raising
its outlook as automakers from Toyota to Honda Motor Co. are
restoring facilities and hiring workers to make up for lost
output from the magnitude-9 temblor. Companies in the nation
expect profits to surge 21 percent in the second half of the
year, according to a Bank of  Japan  estimate released July 1.  “Recovery from the quake is coming along faster than we
expected,” Goro Kanemasu, spokesman for the Aichi, Japan-based
partsmaker, said today by telephone.  Net income will probably be 9 billion yen ($116 million) in
the six months ending Sept. 30, compared with an earlier
estimate of 1 billion yen, according to a statement from Denso
today. Profit dropped to 2.58 billion yen for the three months
ended June 30, compared with 45.9 billion yen a year earlier,
according to the statement.  The company left its forecast unchanged for full-year
profit of 98 billion yen. The estimate is based on a forecast
for the Japanese currency to trade at an average 81 yen to the
dollar in the year ending March 31. The currency, which has
traded at an average of 81.5 yen to the dollar this year,
climbed to as high as 76.65 yen today, the strongest since March
17.  “We aren’t confident about the yen’s fluctuations, so we
are not making changes to our forecast for the second-half,”
Kanemasu said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
