Prima Capital Advisors LLC withdrew a
$670 million collateralized debt obligation tied to property
loans as investors pulled back from securities linked to
commercial-mortgage debt.  Deutsche Bank AG And Wells Fargo & Co. planned to sell the
CDO, which slices loans and securities into new bonds of varying
risk, last week, said a person familiar with the offering, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t public.  The Prima deal was to be the first sale of such debt in
more than three years as banks tried to revive a market that
reached $70 billion of issuance during 2006 and 2007. The
offering was halted after  Standard & Poor’s  suspended ratings on
commercial-mortgage bonds and fiscal crises in the U.S. and
 Europe  roiled the $700 billion market for debt tied to hotels,
shopping centers and offices.  S&P withdrew rankings last week it had assigned to a $1.5
billion offering from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup
Inc., forcing the banks to scuttle the deal after it was placed
with investors.  The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
securities linked to commercial mortgage debt rose 17 basis
points to 226 basis points, or 2.26 percentage points in July,
the third consecutive increase, according to a Barclays Plc
index.  The Prima transaction didn’t have S&P rankings, the person
said.  Sales of CDOs linked to commercial real estate climbed to
$35 billion in 2006 from $16.1 billion in 2005, according to
Credit Suisse Group AG data. Another $35 billion was arranged in
2007, the data show. Issuance dried up in 2008 losses on
subprime mortgages spread across credit markets.  More than $22 billion of commercial-mortgage bonds have
been sold this year, compared with $11.5 billion in all of 2010,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. reduced its forecast for issuance of
the bonds to between $30 billion and $35 billion, the New York-
based lender said in a July 22 report. It had projected in
November as much as $45 billion in new offerings for this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
