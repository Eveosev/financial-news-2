Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , operator of China’s
fifth most-visited website, reported second-quarter profit rose
37 percent, missing analysts’ estimates, after the company
boosted spending to offer online games and video services.  Net income was $42.7 million, or $1.10 a share, from $31.3
million, or 82 cents, a year earlier, the Beijing-based company
said in a statement today. That missed the $50 million average
of six analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 36
percent to $198.7 million.  Sohu is increasing spending on video content and stepping
up development of its search-engine to attract users, helping
the company reduce a reliance on sales of display advertising.
Online games unit  Changyou.com Ltd. (CYOU)  is adding new titles to
compete for gamers against bigger rivals including  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700)  and  NetEase.com (NTES)  Inc.  Third-quarter revenue may reach $225 million to $230
million, Sohu said. That compares with the $208.7 million
average of 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Operating expenses rose 37 percent to $76.8 million last
quarter, Sohu said.  Sohu rose 1.4 percent to $90.10 in New York trading on July
29, and has advanced 42 percent this year.  Changyou increased second-quarter profit 29 percent to
$54.2 million, according to a separate statement today. Sales
rose 35 percent to $105 million. Changyou shares gained 2.2
percent to $51.83 before the announcement.  Sohu ranks behind Baidu Inc., China’s biggest search-
engine, Tencent’s QQ.com, Sina Corp., and Alibaba Group Holding
Ltd.’s Taobao.com in user traffic in  China , according to China
Websites Ranking, a site run by the Internet Society of China
that compiles Web traffic information.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
