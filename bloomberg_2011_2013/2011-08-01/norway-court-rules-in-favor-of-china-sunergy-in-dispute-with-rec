China Sunergy Co. said a court of
appeal in  Norway  ruled in favor of China Sunergy in relation to
the dispute with REC Wafer Norway AS.  “After an oral hearing the Halogaland Court of Appeal on
June 30, 2011, ruled in favor of China Sunergy and determined
that REC Wafer was not, and had never been a party to the
contract,” the company said in an e-mailed press release today.
“As of a result of this, there will be no need for a further
injunction with regard to a $50 million bank guarantee.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
