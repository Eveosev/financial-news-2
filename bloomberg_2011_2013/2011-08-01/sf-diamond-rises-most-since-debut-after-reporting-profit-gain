SF Diamond Co., a Chinese maker of
drill bits and cutting tools, gained the most since its trading
debut in Shenzhen more than five months ago after saying first-
half profit rose 7 percent from a year earlier.  The company gained by the 10 percent daily limit to 26.51
yuan, the biggest one-day increase since the stock began trading
in Shenzhen on Feb. 15.  China ’s benchmark Shanghai Composite
Index rose 0.1 percent.  SF Diamond’s first-half earnings report implies a 53
percent increase in second-quarter net income from a year
earlier, compared with a 57 percent decline for profit in the
first-three months of the year. The company, based in the city
of  Zhengzhou  in central China’s Henan province, said first-
quarter profits fell partly due to one-time expenses associated
with its listing.  First-half profit rose to 18.2 million yuan ($2.83 million)
from 17 million yuan a year earlier, according to a statement
filed to Shenzhen’s stock exchange yesterday, which didn’t give
quarterly numbers. Second-quarter profit increased to 15 million
yuan from 9.9 million yuan, according to figures Bloomberg
derived from the company’s financial reports.  A man who answered the phone at the office of SF Diamond’s
board secretary, who declined to give his name, said he couldn’t
immediately confirm the derived figures.  The company produces drill bits for mining that have a
layer of polycrystalline diamonds. It also produces cutting
tools and abrasives using the material, which consist of
numerous small synthetic diamond grains.  SF Diamond also plans to invest 132 million yuan in a
 production line  to manufacture 668,000 polycrystalline diamond
compact picks and 25,000 drilling bits a year, according to a
separate statement yesterday.  --Emma Dong. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
