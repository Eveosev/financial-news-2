Reserve Bank  of  India  Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao comments on  interest rates  and inflation. He
was addressing students of Gitam University in the southern
Indian city of Visakhapatnam today.  “Growth last year was 8.5 percent and this year may be
slightly lower. We need to raise rates to restrain inflation.
That hurts growth. So, people say are you not hurting growth in
order to contain inflation? Our response is that, we need to
restrain inflation in order to ensure that our medium-term
growth is sustainable.  “Inflation is being driven by three factors. First is food
and it’s not monsoon related. But, what we have to bear is that
across villages in India, incomes have gone up, people there are
eating better, people are shifting from cereals to protein. So,
there is a structural component to food inflation.  “Second of course, is quite familiar. Crude and other
commodity prices have firmed up and that is having an impact on
inflation.  “The third is demand. Across rural areas, incomes have
gone up and that rise in income is quickly translating into rise
in demand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
