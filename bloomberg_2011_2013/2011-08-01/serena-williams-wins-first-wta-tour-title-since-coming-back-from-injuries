Serena Williams  won the Bank of the
West Classic in her third tournament back from a yearlong layoff
from the women’s tennis tour because of injury.  Williams defeated France’s Marion Bartoli 7-5, 6-1 in
yesterday’s final in Stanford, California, avenging her fourth
round loss at Wimbledon, where the American had been a two-time
defending champion.  Williams’s 38th career WTA Tour title lifted her up 90
places to 79th in the world rankings. She’d  previously played  at
Wimbledon and Eastbourne,  England , this season after being
sidelined from July 2010 to mid-June this year by two foot
operations and a blood clot in her lungs.  “I haven’t won a tournament that isn’t a Grand Slam in
forever, so this is cool,” Williams, a 13-time Grand Slam
singles champion, said on the WTA Tour website. “I’m taking
every tournament much more seriously now. Not that I didn’t
before, but now even more so.”  It was the first time Williams, 29, played in a WTA Tour
event in the U.S. since 2009. The  U.S. Open , the season’s final
major tournament where Williams is a three-time winner, is
scheduled for Aug. 29 to Sept. 11 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
