U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the compromise plan to raise the debt ceiling will
boost the economy.  “It will be good for the economy long-term,” Geithner
said today on the “ABC World News with Diane Sawyer”
television program. “It avoids doing more damage in the
short term because the president refused to accept the types of
deep spending cuts that many in Congress wanted.”  The House plans to vote today on the agreement after a
months-long struggle over raising the $14.3 trillion debt
ceiling before the nation’s borrowing capacity expires tomorrow.
The measure cleared a House procedural hurdle on a 249-178 vote.
The Senate will vote tomorrow, said  Don Stewart , a spokesman for
Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell .  Geithner also told ABC that the agreement assures “some
long-term savings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
