Sugar shipments from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer and exporter, jumped in July to the
highest in eight months, Brazil’s Trade Ministry said.  Exports of the sweetener totaled 3.06 million metric tons
in July, up 5.5 percent from 2.9 million tons a year earlier,
the ministry said in a report posted on its website. It’s the
highest since November, when Brazil exported 3.11 million tons.  Ships waiting today to load sugar at Brazil’s six main
ports are expected to transport 1.68 million tons, research firm
SA Commodities said in an e-mailed report. That compares with
3.51 million tons a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
