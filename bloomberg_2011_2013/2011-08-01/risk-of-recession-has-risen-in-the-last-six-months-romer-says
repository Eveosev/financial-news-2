The risk that the U.S. economy will
lapse into another recession has gone up in the past six months,
said  Christina Romer , former chairman of the White House Council
of Economic Advisers.  “The risks have gone up for another recession compared to
where we were six months ago,” Romer said in a television
interview on “Bloomberg Street Smart” with Carol Masser and
 Matt Miller . “That’s still not my best estimate of where we’re
headed, but it’s certainly a bigger risk today than it was in
the past.”  The U.S. economy grew less than forecast in the second
quarter, after almost stalling at the start of the year.
Gross domestic product climbed at a 1.3 percent annual rate
following a 0.4 percent gain in the prior quarter that was less
than earlier estimated, Commerce Department figures showed July
29 in  Washington .  Manufacturing in the U.S. almost stalled in July,
threatening to deprive the recovery of one of its main drivers.
The Institute for Supply Management factory index dropped to
50.9, the lowest since July 2009, from 55.3 the previous month,
the group reported today. Figures less than 50 signal
contraction.  The  U.S. economy  is headed for “more of the same” which
is “anemic, but positive growth,” said Romer, 52, an economics
professor at the University of California-Berkeley  “Certainly the closer you get to zero growth, the more
likely it is you are going to get a negative number at some
point,” she said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
