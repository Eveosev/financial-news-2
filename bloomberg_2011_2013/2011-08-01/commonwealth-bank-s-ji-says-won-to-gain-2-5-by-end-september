Andy Ji, a Singapore-based currency
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , comments on the
outlook for South Korea’s won in an interview today after data
showed the nation’s inflation accelerated to a four-month high
of 4.7 percent in July and exports increased 27.3 percent.  The Australian bank forecasts the currency will strengthen
2.5 percent to 1,025 per dollar by the end of September, before
declining to 1,050 by the end of the year. The won advanced 0.3
percent to 1,050.70 as of the close today in Seoul.  ”Inflation in Korea is really a problem and is above the
central bank’s target.  Core inflation  has been creeping up
throughout this year. We are looking for two rate hikes by
October or November.  ”You will probably see export-growth peak by the end of
the year. We see that growth momentum is slowing down in  Asia ,
and exports to the U.S. as well. We foresee that next year,
there won’t be such strong macroeconomic fundamentals that can
support the won.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
