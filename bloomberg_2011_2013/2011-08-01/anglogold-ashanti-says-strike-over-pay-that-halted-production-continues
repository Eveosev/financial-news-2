A strike over pay at the South
African operations of  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  continues,  Alan
Fine , a spokesman for the worldâ€™s third-largest producer of the
metal, said by mobile phone today.  Talks to end the strike, which started on July 28, will
resume today between the Chamber of Mines and unions after
producers made a final wage-increase offer to workers, the
United Association of South Africa labor union said on July 29.
The strike forced production at AngloGold and  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) 
to grind to a halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
