Ghana  secured a $50 million credit
facility to upgrade its shoe factory at Kumasi, the Ghana  News
Agency  reported.  The plant will be run by the Ghana Armed Forces, in
partnership with a Czech company called Knights, the Accra-based
news agency said, citing Defense Minister Joseph Henry Smith,
who didnâ€™t say where the credit was from.  The factory, about 73 miles (117 kilometers) from the
capital, Accra, will manufacture shoes for soldiers and other
security agencies, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
