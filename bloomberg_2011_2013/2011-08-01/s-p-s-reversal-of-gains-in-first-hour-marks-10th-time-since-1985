The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gave
back a gain of 1 percent and more during the first hour of
trading today, only the 10th time it has had such a reversal
since 1985.  Weaker-than-expected manufacturing growth in July sent the
 S&P 500  to a loss of as much as 0.9 percent by 10:30 a.m. after
rising 1.2 percent. There have been nine other instances in
which the index has been up 1 percent or more in the first half
hour of trading, only to erase its gains and register a decline
of at least 0.5 percent by 10:30 a.m., according to Bespoke
Investment Group LLC.  Eight instances of the reversals, including today’s, have
occurred since Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for
bankruptcy in September 2008, which helped trigger the global
financial crisis, the data show. The other two reversals
occurred in 1988 and 1998.  In five of the cases, the S&P 500 recovered to end with a
gain for the entire day.
