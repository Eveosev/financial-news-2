Demolitions of supertankers, which
carry about 20 percent of the world’s oil, are slowing as ship
owners accept unprofitable rates rather than write off assets,
creating the industry’s biggest glut in 29 years.  Scrapping vessels, each the size of the Chrysler Building,
will drop 19 percent to 2.8 million deadweight tons of carrying
capacity this year, according to London-based Clarkson Plc, the
world’s largest shipbroker. The fleet will expand 7.5 percent to
176.7 million deadweight tons, the most since 1982, as demand
for seaborne crude advances 2.8 percent, the broker estimates.  Owners are effectively paying clients $1,037 a day to
charter vessels on the industry’s benchmark route in the single-
voyage market, the first negative rate since at least 2008.
Frontline Ltd., the biggest operator of the ships, needs $29,700
to break even. Unprofitable voyages may still be preferable to
the $22.5 million that BW Maritime Pte Ltd. estimates owners
would lose by scrapping tankers five years earlier than the
standard lifetime of about 25 years.  “Hope springs eternal,” said Andreas Sohmen-Pao, chief
executive officer of Singapore-based BW Maritime, which has 15
supertankers in its fleet of 105 ships. “Faced with a choice of
crystallizing a loss which could have knock-on consequences for
financing arrangements and bank loans and so on, people say,
well, better to sweat it out and see if something changes.”  Owners ordered the most vessels in about three decades in
2007 and 2008, when returns exceeded $229,000 a day, just as the
world economy entered its worst recession since World War II.
Last year’s 47 percent jump in scrapping means just 2 percent of
the fleet is now older than 20 years, with another 10 percent
between 15 and 19 years-old, data from Clarkson show.  Annual Loss  Rates for the vessels will average $20,000 this year, the
lowest since at least 1997, and $28,000 in 2012, according to
Jonathan Chappell, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. in  New
York . Frontline, based in Hamilton,  Bermuda , will report its
first annual loss since 2002, according to analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Rates went negative yesterday on the Saudi Arabia-to-Japan
route, the industry’s benchmark. Shipping companies accept them
because customers still pay for some of the fuel, cutting costs
for owners moving vessels into regions with better returns.  Frontline is rejecting some charters for the ships, also
known as very large crude carriers, because the returns are
“nonsense,” said Jens Martin Jensen, the Singapore-based chief
executive officer of the company’s management unit. Jensen said
last year he would rather send crews fishing than accept rates
below $10,000 a day.  ‘Drifting Around’  “We are of course looking with amazement at some owners
who are fixing voyages at a loss, not even below $10,000 but at
a loss, and we are not doing that,” Jensen said. “We have some
ships now drifting around. I would not say that the crew is
fishing, but we have some ships which we are holding back.”  Shipping companies typically have a combination of tankers
competing for business in the single-voyage market and vessels
operating on longer-term contracts at fixed rates.  Forward freight agreements, used to bet on future shipping
costs, anticipate rates no higher than $24,757 through 2013,
according to Imarex ASA, a broker of the derivatives in Oslo.
The accords are tied to the Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route and
settled against pricing from the London-based Baltic Exchange.  Shipping costs are volatile, moving 59 percent or more in
each of the past 11 quarters, according to the Baltic Exchange,
which publishes rates for more than 50 maritime routes.  Tanker Index  Frontline will report a loss of $17.13 million this year,
compared with net income of $161.4 million in 2010, the mean of
19 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows. Shares of
the company fell 64 percent since December, compared with a 34
percent decline in the  Bloomberg Tanker Index (TANKER) , whose six members
also operate smaller vessels such as aframaxes and suezmaxes.
Supertankers carry about 2 million barrels of oil, suezmaxes
about half of that and aframaxes about 690,000 barrels.  Shares of Frontline fell 8.1 percent to 54.75 kroner as of
4:27 p.m. in Oslo trading, and earlier reached 54.60 kroner, the
lowest since July 2003.  Ship owners are also facing the prospect that demand will
weaken as economic growth slows. The U.S., the world’s biggest
consumer of crude, will expand 2.5 percent this year, compared
with 3 percent in 2010, according to the median estimate of 66
economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. seaborne crude imports will drop 4 percent to 6.9
million barrels a day this year, the lowest since at least 1999,
according to Clarkson. Oil imports into  China , the engine of the
global recovery, fell 8.6 percent to 19.7 million metric tons in
June, the lowest since October. About 90 percent of global trade
moves by sea, according to the Round Table of International
Shipping Associations.  Oldest Vessels  Crude traded in New York will average $96.41 a barrel in
the fourth quarter and $97.71 in the first three months of next
year, compared with $95.28 now, according to the median estimate
of as many as 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Scrapping jumped 47 percent to 3.45 million deadweight tons
last year as the slump in rates encouraged owners to demolish
their oldest vessels. All of those were tankers with hulls made
from a single layer of steel. The European Union says they are
more accident prone than the latest double-hulled ships.  Single-hulled supertankers now comprise 4 percent of the
fleet, compared with 20 percent at the beginning of 2010,
limiting the potential for more scrapping, according to
Chappell, who previously worked for JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Accidents involving single-hulled ships from the Exxon
Valdez off  Alaska  in 1989 to the Erika off  France  a decade later
spurred governments to agree on an International Maritime
Organization ban that began in 2010 and will be phased in over
five years.  Storing Oil  About 78 percent of  oil tankers  are demolished in
 Bangladesh , the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development estimates. The global fleet of supertankers consists
of 567 ships, according to Clarkson.  One alternative to scrapping ships may be converting them
into what are known as floating production, storage and
offloading units, used offshore to process and store oil. Demand
for such conversions is strengthening because oil discoveries
are being made offshore, George Saroglou, chief operating
officer of Tsakos Energy Navigation Ltd., told investors on a
conference call July 28. The Athens-based company has three
supertankers in its fleet, data on its website show.  The cost of a 5-year-old double-hulled supertanker was last
at $80.88 million, compared with as much as $162 million in
2008,  Baltic Exchange  data show.  “In these poor market conditions, you would normally
expect a significant exodus of ships,” said Erik Nikolai Stavseth, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo whose
recommendations on the shares of shipping companies would have
earned investors 22 percent in the past year. “There’s no real
scope for that now, and that is a headache owners will have to
deal with through continued weak rates.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
