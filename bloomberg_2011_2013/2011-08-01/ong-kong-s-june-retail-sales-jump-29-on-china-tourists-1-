Hong Kong ’s retail sales jumped 28.8
percent in June to HK$31.3 billion ($4 billion), the biggest
gain in more than a year, on tourist arrivals and low
unemployment.  The increase compared with 27.8 percent in May and the
median 29.6 percent estimate of eight economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The advance, reported by the government on its
website today, was the biggest since February last year, when
spending was swelled by a Lunar New Year holiday.  Sales growth maintained momentum due to “vibrant local
consumption demand and tourist spending,” the government said
today in a statement. Declines in Hong Kong’s dollar, which is
pegged to the U.S. currency, make the city’s prices more
attractive for visiting tourists.  “The positive trend will continue because the jobless rate
is low and the weak  Hong Kong dollar  supports tourist
spending,”  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit
Agricole CIB, said in Hong Kong.  China ’s yuan has gained about 2.7 percent against Hong
Kong’s dollar this year, Bloomberg data shows.  “Foreign brands are about 10 percent to 20 percent more
expensive in  Shanghai ,” said Lisa Wan, a tourist from the
Chinese city, who said today that she spent about HK$40,000
during a four-day visit to Hong Kong. She bought items
including handbags, clothes, and cosmetics.  The city’s jobless rate in the three months through the end
of June was 3.5 percent, close to the lowest level in two years.  -- With assistance from Michael Munoz in Hong Kong. Editors:
