Gold declined from a record in  New
York  on optimism that Congress will pass a compromise to raise
the U.S. debt limit and prevent a default, curbing demand for
the metal as an investment heaven.  Leaders of both parties agreed on a plan to raise the debt
ceiling by at least $2.1 trillion, President  Barack Obama  said
yesterday. The House plans votes today on the agreement and the
Senate may follow. Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said he
expects a vote “hopefully during” today’s session.  “Gold is lower on the debt deal,” Tom Pawlicki, an
analyst at MF Global Holdings Ltd. in Chicago, said today in a
telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery fell $9.50, or 0.6
percent, to close at $1,621.70 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. The price climbed to a record $1,637.50 on
July 29.  “There still remains some pessimism that the deal could
fall at the last hurdle,”  James Moore , an analyst at
TheBullionDesk.com in London, said in a report. “But given the
scale of gains posted in recent weeks, the yellow metal is
vulnerable to a deeper correction should the deal be given full
approval.”  Gold has gained 14 percent this year as debt woes escalated
in the U.S. and Europe and amid signs of a faltering global
economy. Manufacturing indexes from Asia to the U.S. fell in
July as demand weakened.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 79.7 cents, or 2
percent, to $39.309 an ounce on the Comex.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose $1.80, or 0.2
percent, to $829.50 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Platinum futures for October delivery added $9.30, or 0.5
percent, to $1,794.60 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
