Growth in German plant and machinery
orders slowed in June, adding to signs that the recovery in
 Europe ’s largest economy is losing momentum, the VDMA machine
makers’ association said.  Orders, adjusted for inflation, rose 1 percent from a year
earlier after increasing 21 percent in May, the Frankfurt-based
VDMA said in an e-mailed statement today. Domestic orders
dropped 14 percent, while export orders gained 10 percent. In
the second quarter, orders climbed 14 percent from the year-
earlier period.  “The decline of domestic orders can be explained by the
exceptionally strong gain in the previous year but there are
also first signs that the investment goods cycle in  Germany  and
the euro-area member countries has become less dynamic,” VDMA
economist Olaf Wortmann said in the statement.  Plant and machinery orders increased 23 percent in the
first half of the year, he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
