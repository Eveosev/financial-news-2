BowLeven Plc (BLVN) , the  oil company  working
with Vitol SA at Cameroon’s Etinde permit, slumped to an eight-
month low in London trading after saying it will drill its next
exploration well alone.  “Vitol has elected not to participate in the drilling of
the Sapele-3 exploration well,” Edinburgh-based BowLeven said
today in a statement, without giving a reason. Its stock fell as
much as 8.9 percent to 238.25 pence, the lowest intraday price
since Nov. 9, and was at 240 pence as of 12:59 p.m. London time.  The partnership at Etinde began two years ago after Geneva-
based Vitol agreed to buy a 25 percent stake in the permit,
operated by BowLeven, and provide funds for its exploration.  Patrick Handley, a spokesman for Vitol, declined to comment
on the company’s operations in Cameroon by telephone today.  BowLeven will use the Sapphire rig at  Sapele-3 , after the
vessel completed drilling at Sapele-2, where tests showed a peak
flow rate of 2,738 barrels of oil equivalent a day, including
high-quality light oil, BowLeven said in the statement. The
shares earlier rose as much as 5.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
