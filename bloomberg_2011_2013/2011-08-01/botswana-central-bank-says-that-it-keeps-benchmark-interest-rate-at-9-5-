Botswana’s central bank kept its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 9.5 percent, predicting
that inflation will slow to within its target range next year.  “Low demand and the forecast modest external inflationary
pressures contribute to the positive inflation outlook in the
medium term,” the Gaborone-based Bank of Botswana said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The central bank has kept the key rate steady this year
after reducing it from 10 percent in December to help boost the
economy of the world’s biggest diamond producer. The southern
African nation fell into recession in 2009 after gem demand
collapsed during the global economic crisis.  Annual inflation will probably stay above the bank’s 3
percent to 6 percent range until the second half of 2012 as food
prices gain and costs in neighboring South Africa climb, the
central bank said. Consumer prices rose 7.9 percent in June
after increasing 8.3 percent in May, the statistics office said
on July 15.  While the  mining industry  is expected to benefit from a
recovery in world demand, Botswana’s economic growth will be
curbed by a decline in  government spending , the bank said.  Botswana plans to cut spending to bring its budget into
balance by the 2012-13 fiscal year, Finance Minister Kenneth Matambo told reporters today. The fiscal gap will probably
narrow to 6.2 billion pula ($959 million) in the year through
March 2012 from 8.5 billion pula a year earlier, he said. The
deficit widened to about 15 billion pula, or 15 percent of gross
domestic product, in 2009-10, according to the government.  The pula strengthened 0.3 percent to 6.468 per dollar by
6:15 p.m. in Gaborone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
