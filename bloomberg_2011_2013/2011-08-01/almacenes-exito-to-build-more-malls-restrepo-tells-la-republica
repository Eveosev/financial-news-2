Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO) ,  Colombia ’s
largest retailer, plans to build more shopping centers in the
South American country, Chief Executive Officer Gonzalo Restrepo
told La Republica newspaper.  Exito will use part of the resources from its planned share
sale to fund the construction of the malls from the current
eight it has so far, Restrepo said in an  interview  with the
Bogota-based daily. The company’s shareholders approved plans to
raise as much as $1.4 billion by selling new shares and to buy a
stake in Uruguayan supermarkets from majority shareholder Casino
