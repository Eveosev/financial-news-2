German bond yields were near the
lowest in over two weeks amid concern a compromise deal on the
U.S. debt ceiling won’t prevent a credit-rating downgrade of the
world’s largest economy.  Spanish and Italian bonds pared gains as the U.S. House of
Representatives prepared to vote on a deal to raise the debt
limit by at least $2.1 trillion and slash  government spending  by
$2.4 trillion or more. European unemployment and manufacturing
reports cast doubt on the strength of the 17-member currency
region’s economic recovery. The  U.S. economy  grew at a slower-
than-forecast 2.3 percent pace in the second quarter, a report
showed on July 29.  “I would have expected fixed income to go much lower,”
said  Glenn Marci , a strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “The
picture for the U.S. is still uncertain, particularly after the
GDP numbers, and people are not that willing to return to the
U.S.” markets, he said.  Ten-year bund yields were little changed at 2.54 percent as
of 2:32 p.m. in  London , after earlier rising six basis points to
2.59 percent. The 3.25 percent security maturing in July 2021
traded at 106.11. Yields on two-year notes were also little
changed, at 1.16 percent.  The House plans votes today and the Senate may follow suit
to consider the agreement reached during a weekend of
negotiations that capped a months-long struggle over raising the
$14.3 trillion debt ceiling. Negotiations were spurred by
economic uncertainty after second-quarter growth missed
estimates last week and first-quarter GDP was revised down.  Europe Unemployment  European manufacturing growth weakened for a third month in
July, data today showed, adding to signs that the region’s
economy is losing momentum. A manufacturing gauge based on a
survey of purchasing managers in the euro region fell to 50.4
from 52 in June, the lowest reading since October 2009, when it
was below 50 for a 16th straight month. A number above 50
indicates expansion.  At 21 percent,  Spain  had the highest jobless rate in the
euro region, while Austria the lowest at 4 percent, said the
European Union statistics office in Luxembourg.  Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds rose relative to
benchmark bunds for the first time in four days. The yield on
10-year Spanish bonds fell five basis points to 6.03 percent,
reducing the additional yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of similar-maturity German bunds by five
basis points to 349 basis points.  Debt Auctions  Italy’s 10-year yield slipped five basis points to 5.82
percent as the  unemployment rate  fell to near a two-year low.
The Italian-German yield spread narrowed by six basis points to
327 basis points.  Portuguese bonds declined, pushing the two-year note yield
six basis points higher to 14.64 percent. Similar-maturity Irish
yields gained 11 basis points to 14.48 percent.  France  auctioned 8.5 billion euros of 84-, 175- and 357-day
bills. The Netherlands sold 2.46 billion euros of three-month
bills at an average yield of 0.9 percent, six-month bills at 1
percent and nine-month bills at 1.105 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors 3 percent this
year, compared with 4.3 percent for U.S. Treasuries, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish bonds have lost 0.2
percent, while Italian debt has slipped 3.5 percent and
 Portugal ’s has declined 22 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
