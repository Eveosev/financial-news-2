Kinetic Concepts Inc. (KCI)  plans to
finance its leveraged buyout by a group led by Apax Partners LLP
with a $2.6 billion term loan, the second-largest such debt
offering this year, according to two people with knowledge of
the deal.  The debt financing also includes $1.25 billion of senior
secured notes, $900 million of senior unsecured bonds and a $200
million revolving  credit line , said the people, who declined to
be identified, because the details haven’t been disclosed.  The term loan would be the second largest such deal this
year behind the $2.7 billion of debt supporting Del Monte Food
Co.’s buyout by KKR & Co., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp. and Credit
Suisse Group AG have committed funding for the $6.3 billion
purchase of San Antonio-based Kinetic, the biggest LBO since
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failure in September 2008.  Morgan Stanley is leading the loan and Bank of America is
arranging the notes offering, one of the people said.  The maker of wound-care products has agreed to be taken
private by  Apax , the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and
the Public Sector Pension Investment Board for $68.50 per share.  Kevin Belgrade, a spokesman for Kinetic Concepts, didn’t
immediately return a phone call seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan , it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
