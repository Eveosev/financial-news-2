U.K. stocks declined for a second day
as a report showed that U.S. manufacturing expanded at its
slowest pace in two years, overshadowing earnings that topped
estimates at  HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA)   Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  BAE Systems Plc (BA/)  sank more than
2 percent after the  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.
factory index fell.  Laird Plc (LRD)  slumped 15 percent after Cooper
Industries Plc withdrew its proposed takeover offer. HSBC,
 Europe ’s biggest bank, climbed the most in four months.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  lost 40.76, or 0.7 percent, to 5,774.43
at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, having earlier climbed 1.7
percent. The gauge has tumbled 5.2 percent from this year’s high
on Feb. 8 amid speculation that Europe’s debt crisis would
spread and as concern mounted that U.S. lawmakers would fail to
agree on increasing the federal debt limit. The FTSE All-Share
Index also dropped 0.7 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
declined 2.3 percent.  Today’s manufacturing data “brought the focus back onto a
stuttering U.S. recovery,” said  Richard Hunter , head of U.K.
equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Plc in  London . “It had looked
quite frothy on the back of the weekend’s events but the ISM
number turned the market on a sixpence.”  ISM’s factory index fell to 50.9 in July from 55.3 in June.
Economists had predicted that the gauge would drop to 54.5,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.
Figures greater than 50 signal expansion.  Debt Ceiling  President  Barack Obama  said yesterday that Republican and
Democrat leaders in both the U.S. House and Senate had reached
an agreement to increase the debt ceiling by at least $2.1
trillion and cut  government spending  by $2.4 trillion or more.
The House planned to vote on the deal today and the Senate may
follow.  Lloyds, the U.K.’s largest mortgage lender, sank 5 percent
to 41.19 pence. BAE Systems, the arms company that last year
made 48 percent of revenue in the U.S., dropped 3 percent to 295
pence.  Laird slumped 15 percent to 159.8 pence, its largest drop
since November 2008. Cooper Industries withdrew its proposed
offer for the biggest maker of electronic shields for laptops
and televisions.  Kofax Plc (KFX)  tumbled 8 percent to 333 pence. Jefferies Group
Inc. downgraded the U.K. maker of image-scanning software to
“hold” from “buy” after the company last week said software-
business revenue trailed its forecasts.  HSBC rose 2.2 percent to 607.5 pence, the biggest gain
since April, after reporting first-half earnings of $9.22
billion, beating analyst estimates of $7.82 billion. The company
said it will cut 30,000 jobs as part of a plan to reduce costs
by as much as $3.5 billion over the next two years.  Intertek, Hammerson  Intertek Group Plc (ITRK) , the world’s largest consumer-goods
testing company, jumped 3.9 percent to 1,990 pence after revenue
and earnings grew. The company predicted higher single-digit
sales growth for the full year and increased its interim
dividend.  Hammerson Plc (HMSO) , Britain’s third-largest real-estate
investment trust, increased 1.4 percent to 472.5 pence after the
company said first-half profit excluding items was little
changed as higher rents reduced the effect of disposals.  African Minerals Ltd. (AMI)  rallied 4.4 percent to 647 pence
after completing an investment accord with Shandong Iron & Steel
Group Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
