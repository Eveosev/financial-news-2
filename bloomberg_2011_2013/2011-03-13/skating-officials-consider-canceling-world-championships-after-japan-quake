Figure skating’s world
championships may be canceled because of the threat of a
meltdown at a Japanese nuclear power plant that was crippled by
the country’s biggest earthquake.  The championships are scheduled to begin March 21 at the
 Yoyogi National Gymnasium  in  Tokyo , 135 miles (217 kilometers)
from the stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi atomic complex. An
explosion is possible at a second reactor building after the
plant’s cooling system failed, officials said today.  “Developments since Saturday, in particular the
developments in the Fukushima nuclear plant, are very
worrisome,” the  International Skating Union said  in a statement
on its website today. “The ISU continues to monitor the
situation in cooperation with the JSF   Japan  Skating Federation)
and the Japanese authorities in order to come to a conclusion as
to maintaining or canceling the championships.”  An estimated 131,700 people were evacuated in Fukushima,
along with 108,900 in nearby prefectures, the national police
said. The death toll from the 8.9 magnitude temblor and the
ensuing tsunami topped 970, with more than 700 missing, 1,683
injured and 350,000 in emergency shelters. The death toll may
reach 10,000, national broadcaster NHK reported, citing local
police.  The U.S. and European countries including  France  have urged
citizens to avoid travel to Japan.  The Lausanne, Switzerland-based ISU said it will make a
further statement tomorrow after receiving updates from Japanese
authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
