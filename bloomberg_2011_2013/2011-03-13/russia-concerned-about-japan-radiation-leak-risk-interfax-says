  Russia  is still concerned about the
risk of radiation leaks from the Fukushima nuclear power plant
in  Japan , Interfax reported, citing Gennady Onishchenko, the
Russian public-health chief.  Cooling systems have apparently failed at six reactors in
the plant, Interfax cited Onishchenko as saying today. Radiation
levels in the Russian  Far East , which borders Japan, remain
normal, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
