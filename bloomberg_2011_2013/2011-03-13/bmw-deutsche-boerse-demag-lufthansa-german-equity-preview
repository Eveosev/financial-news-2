German stocks fell for a fourth
day, led by utilities, after explosions at an atomic power plant
in Japan that followed the country’s biggest earthquake on
record prompted a review of nuclear-energy safety.    E.ON AG (EOAN)  and  RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s largest utilities, each sank
more than 4 percent after the German government put plans to
extend the life of its nuclear power facilities on hold.  Conergy
AG (CGY)  led gains in renewable-energy shares, rallying 22 percent.
Insurers  Allianz SE (ALV) ,  Munich Re  and  Hannover Re  retreated at
least 2 percent.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  tumbled 1.7 percent to 6,866.63 at
the 5:30 p.m. close in  Frankfurt , the lowest level in two
months. The gauge has declined 7.5 percent since peaking at a 2
1/2-year high on Feb. 18 as opponents of Libyan ruler  Muammar Qaddafi  fought to wrest control of the country, disrupting oil
production. The broader  HDAX Index (HDAX)  slid 1.6 percent today.  Japan’s Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said yesterday that the
country faces its worst crisis since World War II after the
March 11 temblor and ensuing tsunami killed an estimated 10,000
people.  Workers battled to prevent a nuclear meltdown after a
second blast rocked an atomic plant north of  Tokyo  today.
Cooling systems have failed on three of the Fukushima Dai-Ichi
station’s reactors.  E.ON, RWE Slide  E.ON lost 5.3 percent to 21.87 euros and RWE dropped 4.8
percent to 45.64 euros. Germany will suspend a planned extension
of the lifespan of the country’s nuclear-power plants pending
the outcome of an inquiry into their safety in the light of the
disaster in  Japan ,  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said today.  In 2010, Merkel extended the lives of the country’s 17
atomic power plants by an average 12 years to help maintain  energy security  and cut carbon emissions. Over the weekend,
opposition politicians renewed calls for the government to pass
a law that would see the last reactor close by about 2020.  Clean-energy companies soared as the concerns about nuclear
power spurred buying of rival technologies.  Conergy, a Hamburg-based solar panel maker, jumped 22
percent to 38 euro cents.  Solarworld AG (SWV)  surged 13 percent to
8.63 euros.  Q-Cells SE (QCE)  climbed 15 percent to 3 euros.  Allianz,  Europe ’s biggest insurer, dropped 2.9 percent to
96.90 euros. Munich Re, the world’s largest reinsurer, fell 3.4
percent to 108 euros, while Hannover Re declined 2 percent to
37.87 euros.  “Insurers and reinsurers will be very exposed,” said Yves Marcais, equity sales trader at Global Equities in Paris. “The
damage is very, very significant. Many utilities companies have
been counting on nuclear as a solution after an increase in  oil
prices . If that isn’t possible, other questions arise.”    Air Berlin Plc (AB1)  slid 3.9 percent to 3.17 euros as Morgan
Stanley cut its rating on the stock to “underweight” from
“equal weight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
