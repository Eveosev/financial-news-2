Long-term inflation expectations
remain “quite stable” as the world economy recovers from the
credit crisis, suggesting confidence in central banks to deliver
constant prices, according to a study by economists at the  Bank
for International Settlements .  While measures of long-term uncertainty about inflation are
now higher than before the crisis, they are stable and “in this
regard, central-bank credibility seems to remain high,” said
the economists at the Basel, Switzerland-based institution.  “This could change if policy makers are seen to be slow in
responding to unexpected increases in inflation, which in turn
could trigger rapid upward revisions in inflation
expectations,” Petra Gerlach, Peter Hoerdahl and Richhild
Moessner said in the study, published today. “At the same time,
in many mature economies, any premature tightening could
jeopardize the economic recovery and risk sparking expectations
of deflation.”  Central banks seek to anchor inflation expectations to
ensure companies and workers don’t begin to bet on mounting
price pressures and seek compensation through higher wages or
prices, triggering an inflation spiral.  The fact that long-term expectations are higher than before
the crisis “could raise questions about how firmly expectations
are anchored,” the economists said. They also noted that there
“is a risk that low headline inflation expectations may become
entrenched” in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
