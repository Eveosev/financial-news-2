  Edison SpA (EDN)  may ask Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. for an independent valuation of its assets to end a
shareholder dispute about the extent of writedowns,  Il Sole 24
Ore  reported, without saying where it got the information.  Electricite de France SA and the Italian shareholders,
which jointly control 61 percent of the Italian electricity
company, will accept a proposal at a board meeting tomorrow from
three independent directors to ask Goldman to review its books,
the newspaper said.  EDF is pushing for deeper writedowns than the 200 million
euros ($278 million) proposed by an outside consultant for
Edison, the newspaper said. EDF has already provisioned about
700 million euros against its 50 percent stake in Edison. The
dispute means that the board will not approve the companyâ€™s 2010
results tomorrow as scheduled, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Andrew Davis  in Rome at
