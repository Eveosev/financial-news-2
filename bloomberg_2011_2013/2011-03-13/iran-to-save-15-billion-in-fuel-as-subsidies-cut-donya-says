  Iran  will save “at least” $15
billion in fuel in the next Iranian year starting on March 21
amid a consumption drop following the government’s slashing of
subsidies,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing an Economy Ministry
official.  Iranians’ consumption of fuel including gasoline,  diesel
fuel  and kerosene has dropped, reversing the trend of the past
decade when the nation’s energy consumption increased on average
by six percent a year, Deputy Minister of Economy Mohammad-Reza Farzin said, according to the newspaper.  In December, Iran started phasing out three-decade-old
subsidies under a five-year plan and replacing them with cash
payments to the population, Donya said. The implementation of
the plan has so far been “successful,” Farzin said, according
to the daily.  Iranians now pay 4,000 rials (40 cents) a liter for 50
liters a month and 7,000 rials a liter for larger volumes. They
previously paid a subsidized price of 1,000 rials a liter for a
monthly maximum of 60 liters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
