Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co.,  Japan ’s biggest zinc producer, hasn’t decided when to resume
operations at its Hachinohe smelter in Aomori prefecture
after a magnitude-8.9 earthquake stopped power supply on
March 11.  “We are not sure when to resume,” the Tokyo-based
company said in a statement today. “The plant stopped
operations on a  power outage  right after the earthquake hit
the area.” The company plans to look into the damage on the
facility soon, it said. Zinc is used to galvanize steel.  The Hachinohe plant has a capacity of 112,000 metric 
tons a year, including prime-western grade, according to 
the company.                                                To contact the reporter on this story:
