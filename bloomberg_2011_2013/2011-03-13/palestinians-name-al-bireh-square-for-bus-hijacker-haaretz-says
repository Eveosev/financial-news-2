Palestinians from Palestinian
Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas â€™s Fatah party today named a
square in the West Bank town of al-Bireh after a woman who led
the 1978 hijacking of an Israeli bus that left 35 people dead,
the daily Haaretz reported, without saying where it got the
information.                        There were no Palestinian government officials at the
ceremony, the paper added.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
