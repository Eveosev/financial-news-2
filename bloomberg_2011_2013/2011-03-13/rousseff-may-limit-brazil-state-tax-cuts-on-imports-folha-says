Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff 
plans to limit or ban states from granting tax exemptions on
imports in a bid to stimulate domestic industry,  Folha de S.
Paulo  newspaper said, citing an unidentified source.  The plan is part of Rousseffâ€™s tax-reform proposal to be
sent for congressional approval by April, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said.  Rousseff also plans to propose cutting payroll taxes for
some industries and lowering levies on investments and small
companies, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
