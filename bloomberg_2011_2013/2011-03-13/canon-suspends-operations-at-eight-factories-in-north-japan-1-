  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s largest
maker of digital cameras, will suspend operations at eight
production and development bases in northern  Japan , according
to a statement from the company today.  The factories are based in prefectures including Ibaraki,
Fukushima and Tochigi affected by the 8.9-magnitude
earthquake and the tsunami it triggered.  Canon’s plant in Utsunomiya City, Tochigi Prefecture,
which makes lenses and steppers, and another factory that
produces inkjet printer devices in Fukushima may take “more
than two or three days” to resume operations, according to
Hiromoto Fujimori, a Tokyo-based spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
