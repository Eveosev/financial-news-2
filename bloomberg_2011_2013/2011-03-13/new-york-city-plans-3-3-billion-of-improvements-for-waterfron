  New York City  will announce a $3.3
billion plan today for new parks, housing, ferry service and
environmental improvements for its 578 miles (930 kilometers) of
shoreline to boost real-estate development and recreation.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg and City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said the 190-page plan, called  Vision 2020 , will connect
neighborhoods to shorelines and improve water quality. It calls
for 130 projects costing $3.3 billion to be completed in the
first three years. Andrew Brent, a city spokesman, said $2.5
billion of the initial cost will be for environmental
protection.  “New York City has more miles of waterfront than  Seattle ,  San Francisco ,  Chicago  and  Portland  combined -- but for decades
too many neighborhoods have been blocked off from it,”
Bloomberg said in a statement.  The city has bought about 400 acres of waterfront land
since 2002 for new parks and it rezoned more than 700 acres of
industrial land for housing and waterfront access in  Brooklyn ,
Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx. New York is also spending
$1.6 billion to upgrade water-treatment plants and plans to pay
out millions more to protect wetlands and enhance drainage.  Under Vision 2020, new East River ferry service will start
in the spring between Brooklyn, Queens and  Manhattan , with stops
in Williamsburg and Long Island City. Waterway transit will
enhance development opportunities, said Steve Spinola, president
of the  Real Estate Board of New York , a developers’ group.  Getting There  “Part of the problem with developing or making the
Brooklyn or Queens waterfront more attractive for investment is,
how do you get there,” Spinola said.  The city selected Stephen Ross’s New York-based Related
Cos. last month to help develop more than 900 new housing units,
mostly for low- or middle-income families, in Hunter’s Point
South in Queens. The project, to be completed by 2014, includes
5 acres of waterfront parkland, new schools and parking.  Among spending in Vision 2020’s first three years will be
$360 million to build 50 acres of new parks, expand 10 existing
parks and develop 14 shoreline walkways. An enlarged boat ramp
at Hunts Point-Riverside Park in the Bronx will be completed by
2013.  The city announced in 2009 that it will invest more than
$165 million on a new container port, industrial buildings and
freight rail on the south Brooklyn waterfront. The project,
centered on the Sunset Park area of the borough, will include a
22-acre park on a formerly polluted site.  City officials say the maritime industry supports 31,800
direct and indirect jobs and generates $1.3 billion in  tax
revenue .  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News’s
parent, Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
