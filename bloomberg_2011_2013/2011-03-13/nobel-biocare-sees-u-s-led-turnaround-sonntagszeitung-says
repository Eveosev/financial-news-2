  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN)  has
managed a turnaround and booked growth between 5 percent and 6
percent, SonntagsZeitung reports, citing an unidentified
official.  “In the U.S. the turnaround is very visible,” the Zurich-
based paper quoted the official as saying. In January sales in
the U.S. grew 16 percent, in February around 14 percent, the
paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
