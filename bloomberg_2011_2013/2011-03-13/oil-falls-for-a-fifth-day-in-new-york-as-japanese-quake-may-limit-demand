Oil fell to a two-week low in New
York on concern the earthquake in  Japan  will limit demand in the
world’s third-largest economy.  Prices have dropped 6.1 percent in five days of losses, the
longest losing streak in more than a month. Japan was struck by
its largest temblor on record on March 11, shutting refineries
accounting for 29 percent of domestic processing capacity,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on Petroleum
Association of Japan data. Canon Inc., Sony Corp. and Nippon
Steel Corp. have halted some manufacturing operations.  “With the closure of the factories and refineries in Japan
we can expect the oil price to take a hit,” said Ben Le Brun,
an analyst at CMC Markets based in Sydney. “It’s not good for
their near-term growth prospects.”  Oil for April delivery fell as much as $2.61, or 2.6
percent, to $98.55 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
It was at $99 at 8:28 a.m. London time. The contract tumbled
$1.54 to $101.16 a barrel on March 11, the lowest settlement
since March 1. Prices are up 25 percent from a year ago.  Brent oil for April settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange dropped as much as $2.68, or 2.4
percent, to $111.16 a barrel, the lowest price since Feb. 25.
The contract fell $1.59, or 1.4 percent, to $113.84 on March 11.  Japan was struck by an 8.9-magnitude temblor that unleashed
a 7-meter (23-foot) tsunami that may have killed 10,000 people
in the north of the country.  Japan Refineries  JX-Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. closed refineries in Sendai,
Kashima and Negishi in Tohoku, or northeast region, of the
country. The plants have combined processing capacity of about
600,000 barrels a day. Cosmo Oil Co. has shut its 220,000 barrel
Chiba facility following fires at liquefied petroleum gas
storage tanks. Kyokuto Petroleum Industries Ltd. has shuttered
its 175,000 barrel-a-day facility in Ichihara near  Tokyo .
TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. said March 11 that it halted the major
units at its 335,000 barrel Kawasaki plant.  The closures have affected about 1.3 million barrels a day
of capacity, or 29 percent of the country’s total of 4.516
million, based on data from the Petroleum Association of Japan.  Japan consumed 4.42 million barrels a day of oil in 2010,
according to data from the  International Energy Agency ’s Feb. 10
Monthly Oil Market Report.  China  used 9.39 million barrels and
the U.S. consumed 19.25 million, the agency said.  “Disruptions to refineries and their supplies will quickly
eat into global demand for crude oil,” Villanova, Pennsylvania-
based analysts The Schork Group Inc. said in a report today.
“The net effect is that three of Japan’s five largest
refineries have been shut down.”  Mideast Unrest  Oil fell 3.1 percent in  New York  last week, the first
weekly drop in a month, following the disaster in Japan. Futures
have surged 9.2 percent since Jan. 14, when the president of  Tunisia  was ousted in the first of the unrest that has rocked
the Middle East and North Africa, including Saudi Arabia’s
neighbors Yemen, Oman and Bahrain. Prices touched a 29-month
high of $106.95 a barrel in intraday trading March 7.  Futures prices also eased last week after a planned series
of protests in Saudi Arabia, the so-called “Day of Rage,” was
prevented by police deployments in the capital of  Riyadh  and
other cities.  “That planned Day of Rage was a non-event as far as I’ve
heard and that seemed to help ease the oil price,” said CMC’s
Le Brun. “Still, there are ongoing tensions in Yemen, Bahrain
and  Iran  and that will put a floor under the oil price.”  Hedge Fund Bets  Hedge funds’ bullish oil bets rose to an all-time high for
a third straight week as concerns about supplies increased amid
fighting in  Libya  and the threats of protests in  Saudi Arabia .  Large speculators and funds increased net-long positions,
or wagers on higher prices, by 2 percent in the seven days ended
March 8 to 311,632 futures and options, the most in records
dating back to June 2006, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s weekly Commitments of Traders report. The
total has jumped 68 percent since Feb. 15.  The CFTC data only reflect positions taken through March 8,
so wouldn’t include any changes since the Japan earthquake.  To contact the reporters on this story:
