Iceland Foods Ltd. is reorganizing
its corporate structure to prepare for a sale later this year,
according to the Sunday Telegraph.  The company is reordering its balance sheet to make the
sale easier, the newspaper reported, without saying where it got
its information. Chief Executive Officer Malcolm Walker, who
founded the company and owns a 24 percent stake, may seek to buy
the entire food store chain, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
