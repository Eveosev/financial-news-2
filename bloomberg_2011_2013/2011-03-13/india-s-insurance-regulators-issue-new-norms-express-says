The Insurance Regulatory and
Development Authority,  India ’s insurance industry regulator,
issued new rules that relaxed solvency ratios for India’s
general insurers, the Financial Express newspaper reported,
citing M. Ramadoss, the chairman and managing director of New
India Assurance.  Under the rules, the solvency ratio for general insurers
has been reduced for March 2011 to 130 percent from 150 percent,
the report said. The newspaper also cited the regulator as
saying that general insurers wouldn’t be allowed to pay any
bonus, dividend and other incentives unless they maintained a
solvency ratio of 150 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
