Mobile Telecommunications Co. of  Saudi Arabia , or Zain Saudi, rose to a two-week high after  Kingdom Holding Co. (KINGDOM)  and Bahrain Telecommunications Co. made a
joint offer to purchase Zainâ€™s 25 percent stake in Zain Saudi.  Zain Saudi surged 7.6 percent to 7.05 riyals, the highest
intraday level since Feb. 27, at 11:07 a.m. in  Riyadh .  The non-binding offer and a preliminary expression of
interest is valid until 9 a.m. Riyadh time on March 14, Kingdom
Holding said in a statement today.  The board of Zain, as Mobile Telecommunications is known,
last month turned down offers from Batelco and Kingdom to
acquire the stake in its Saudi unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
