Grain farmers in Alberta made “rapid
seeding progress” last week, as temperatures warmed and rains
abated, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  In southeastern Saskatchewan and western Manitoba, as much
as 6.5 centimeters (2.6 inches) of rain fell, while the
remainder of the prairies were dry, the board said today in a
 statement .  Planting may be delayed by a week in the areas that
received rain, the board said. Flooding from the Assiniboine
River may cover 45,000 acres (18.2 million hectares) in
Manitoba, while water levels on the Qu’Appelle and Souris rivers
in Saskatchewan are dropping, according to the board.  To contact the reporter on this story:
