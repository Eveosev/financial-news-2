A  Hermes International (RMS)  SCA family
member isn’t necessarily opposed to a collaboration with  LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , which has built a stake in the
company,  Le Journal du Dimanche  reported, citing Nicolas Puech,
who also is a shareholder in Hermes.  Puech would be in favor of a collaboration with LVMH “if
it were to the advantage” of Hermes and if the  maker of Birkin
and Kelly bags  could “retain its free will,” Nicolas Puech was
cited as telling the French weekly newspaper in an  interview .  Nicolas Puech is the brother of Bertrand Puech, chairman
of Emile Hermes SARL, which represents the Hermes family
shareholders, according to JDD. Puech told the newspaper he owns
“a bit less than 6 percent” of the Paris-based  luxury-goods 
maker, according to JDD.  LVMH, the world’s largest maker of luxury goods, has built
a 20.2 percent stake in Hermes since October. This has spurred
the Hermes founding family to create a holding company to try to
protect itself against further purchases by LVMH Chief Executive
Officer  Bernard Arnault . Hermes said March 4 it wasn’t
interested in collaborating with LVMH.  To contact the reporter on this story:
