  Iran  plans export as much as 5
million cubic meters of natural gas daily to Syria by the end of
this year after construction of a pipeline via south  Turkey  is
completed, the  Iranian Oil Ministry’s news website  said.  The route will be used to meet Syria’s "urgent needs" for
gas until the start of a pipeline through Iraq that will supply
40 million cubic meters of gas a day, Shana reported, citing
Iran’s Oil Minister Masoud Mir-Kazemi.  Iranian officials will meet with their Iraqi and Syrian
counterparts this month or the next to finalize a contract on
the export and transit of gas, according to the report.  Iran and  Syria  signed a preliminary agreement on Jan. 19
for the construction of a 2,000-kilometer (1,250-mile) network
to carry Iranian gas via a 56-inch (142-centimeter) pipeline
with a daily capacity of as much as 110 cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
