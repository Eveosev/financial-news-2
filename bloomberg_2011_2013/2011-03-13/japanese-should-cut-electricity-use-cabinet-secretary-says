  Japan ’s citizens should cut back as
much as possible on their use of electricity, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Yukio Edano said as officials struggled to prevent a
potential nuclear power plant meltdown in the wake of the
nation’s worst earthquake and tsunami.  “I ask all Japanese citizens to save electricity in the
most maximum way possible, including large electricity users,”
Edano told reporters at a predawn news conference in Tokyo
today. He said that the power outages may cause “some
confusion” among the public.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. will start service outages in
parts of the greater Tokyo area today, according to a statement.
The biggest supplier of electricity in the capital will divide
its service area into five groups, each with three-hour outages
from 6:20 a.m. to 10 p.m.  Edano said there were “no new developments” to announce
now on the reactors themselves.  Water levels temporarily fell at  Tokyo  Electric’s No. 3
reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi plant 135 miles north of Tokyo,
raising the possibility of an explosion, Edano said late
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
