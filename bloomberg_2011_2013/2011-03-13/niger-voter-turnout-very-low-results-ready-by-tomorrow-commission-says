Voter turnout in Niger for the
runoff presidential election was “very low,” between 35
percent and 40 percent, said Abdourahamane Ghousmane, chairman
of the country’s electoral commission.  Voting was “calm” and no incidents were reported, he said
in remarks broadcast on Tele Sahel, a state-owned broadcaster,
today. The result of the vote will be announced tomorrow,
Ghousmane said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
