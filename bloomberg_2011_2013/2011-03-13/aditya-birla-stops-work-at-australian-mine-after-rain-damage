     March 14 (Bloomberg) --  Aditya Birla Minerals Ltd. (ABY) , the
Australian unit of India’s  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  halted work
at the shuttered Mount Gordon copper mine in Australia because
of damage from recent heavy rain.  Work on restarting underground mining will remain suspended
while an investigation is carried out into the collapse of a
vent shaft collar, the Perth-based company said today in a
statement.  The mine in Queensland state was closed in February 2009
because of declining copper prices and the company now wants to
restart the operation. Copper prices have more than doubled
since it closed the mine.  “Implications on the schedule for the re-commencement of
operations will be ascertained once the risk to the underground
operations and extent and nature of the remedial work on the
collar is determined,” the company said in the statement.  Aditya Birla also produces copper from the Nifty mine in  Western Australia . Hindalco holds 51 percent of the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
