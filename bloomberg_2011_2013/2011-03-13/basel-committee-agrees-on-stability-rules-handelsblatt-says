The international banking
supervisors on the Basel banking committee have agreed on five
rules, the breaking of which would endanger the global financial
system,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing unidentified people.  The supervisors want to set up a list by the summer of 15
to 30 banks that will be subject to stricter control rules, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
