  Phoenix Group Holdings (PHNX)  Ltd., the
U.K.’s biggest manager of closed life-insurance funds, may
refinance its 2.7 billion pound ($3.75 billion) debt to fund
acquisitions, the  Mail on Sunday  reported.  Options being considered may include selling a stake in
Phoenix’s Ignis asset management or securitizing assets, the
newspaper said, citing an unidentified insider. The company has
700 million pounds in cash to finance acquisitions, the
newspaper said. The board wants to have an outline agreement in
place with its banks by March 29, the Mail said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
