  MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ’s outgoing Chief
Executive Officer Phuthuma Nhleko said he regrets the company’s
failure to buy assets of  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE)  and the
transaction “still may come back,” the Sunday Times reported.  The Orascom deal was “far more definitive” than MTN’s
failed bid to merge with India’s Bharti Airtel Ltd., and was
hampered because of a “regulatory issue” in Algeria, Nhleko
told the Johannesburg-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
