  Japan ’s financial markets will
operate “as usual” on Monday, March 14, and will be closely
monitored for improprieties in the wake of the country’s
strongest earthquake on record, the Financial Services Agency
said.  The FSA will work with the nation’s Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission and  stock exchanges  to prevent any
transactions that take advantage of the disaster, including
strict implementation of a ban on naked short selling, Financial
Services Minister Shozaburo Jimi said in a statement today.  The 8.9-magnitude temblor and subsequent tsunami may have
killed 10,000 in Miyagi prefecture north of  Tokyo , national
broadcaster NHK reported, citing local police. The official toll
reached 977, with 739 more missing and 1,683 injured, the  National Police Agency  said.  Jimi is heading a taskforce set up to examine the impact of
the March 11 quake on Japan’s financial systems.  Working jointly with the Bank of Japan, Jimi has asked
financial institutions to accommodate the needs of quake victims
including deposit withdrawals by customers who may have lost
official identification in the disaster, he said. More than
350,000 people are now in emergency shelters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
