BYD Co., the Chinese automaker
backed by  Warren Buffett , said fourth-quarter profit plunged 94
percent after demand for its vehicles slumped in the world’s
largest car market.  Net income fell to 90 million yuan ($13.7 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31 from 1.46 billion yuan a year earlier.
The fourth-quarter figure was calculated by subtracting nine-
month earnings from the full-year results announced by the
company in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.
That compares with the 830 million yuan average of 11 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg and based on their 12-month
projections.  Rising competition from rivals  General Motors Co. (GM) ,  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and Nissan Motor Co. led BYD to cut prices on its
models last month as sales plunged for seven straight months
through February. BYD, whose F3 sedan was China’s best-selling
car the last two years, missed sales targets last year even
after slashing the target by 25 percent to 600,000 vehicles.  “Last year was a tough year for BYD’s auto business,” Ole Hui, a Hong Kong-based analyst with Daiwa Securities Capital
Markets wrote in a report last month. Some of the company’s key
models were late to qualify for the government’s 3,000 yuan
subsidy for fuel-efficient vehicles, hurting sales, Hui said.
The company also cut prices by as much as nine percent mid-2010
in order to clear dealer inventory, he wrote.  BYD fell 1.9 percent to HK$34.30 in  Hong Kong  as of 2:37
p.m. The stock has plunged 16 percent in 2011.  Falling Sales, Prices  The automaker’s full-year earnings fell 33.5 percent to
2.52 billion yuan. Sales in 2010 increased 18 percent to 46.7
billion yuan from a year earlier.  BYD, headed by chairman  Wang Chuanfu , missed its 2010
delivery target by 13 percent, selling 519,806 cars. It cut the
target by 25 percent in August from an earlier estimate of
800,000 units. To revive sales growth, BYD slashed prices of
five car models by as much as 15,000 yuan last month.  GM, Honda and Nissan are also adding new, lower-priced
brands in the world’s largest auto market, while the government
in January ended tax incentives that helped boost sales over the
last two years.  Xia Zhibing, BYD’s head of sales, wrote on his blog last
month that the company, 10 percent owned by Buffett’s Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway Inc., is “preparing for a
price war.”  Cannibalize Sales  The company’s price reductions may “cannibalize the
upcoming new models’ sales and lead to deterioration in
margins” this year, Rebecca Tang and Don See, Hong Kong-based
analysts at Standard Chartered Plc, wrote in a report last month.
Tang and See lowered their 2011 earnings per share estimate for
BYD by 58 percent to 1.25 yuan on the price cuts and profit
erosion.    China ’s vehicle sales surged 32 percent to a record 18.06
million in 2010, helping the nation remain the world’s largest
auto market for a second year.  BYD has a consensus rating among 27 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg of 2.7 out of a possible 5, with “sells” topping
“buys” by 12-to-eight. Seven recommend holding the stock.  BYD will bring its E6 pure electric cars to the U.S. this
year, Wang said in January, delaying a previous plan to begin
deliveries in 2010. Fleet sales of the E6 will start at the end
of 2011, while retail deliveries will commence in the first
quarter of 2012, he said at the time.  The carmaker said at last year’s Detroit show it would
bring the E6, which can run for more than 300 kilometers (186
miles) on a full charge, to the U.S. in 2010.  --Liza Lin, Tian Ying. With assistance from Fox Hu and Fion Li
