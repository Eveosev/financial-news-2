Omanâ€™s ruler Sultan Qaboos bin Said
Al-Said has issued a decree that paves the way for certain legal
amendments to give the 154-seat Council of Oman legislative
power, state-run Oman News Agency reported today.  A proposal of the amendment will be submitted to the Sultan
after 30 days, the report said.  The Council of Oman, whose members are appointed by the
Sultan and serves as an advisory body, includes the Consultative
Council and the State Council.  To contact the reporter on this story:
