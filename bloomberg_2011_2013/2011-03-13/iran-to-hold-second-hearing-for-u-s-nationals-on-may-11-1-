  Iran  will hold a second hearing for
three Americans charged with espionage and illegal entry into
Iran on May 11, the head of the Tehran province judiciary
Alireza Avaei said, according to the official  Islamic Republic
News Agency .    Josh Fattal  and  Shane Bauer  were detained alongside Sarah
Shourd in July 2009 for illegally crossing into Iran from  Iraqi
Kurdistan . The U.S. government has said the trio mistakenly
wandered across the border during a hiking trip.  Shourd, who was released in September 2010 on bail of
$500,000, leaving the country immediately, had been summoned to
return for the trialâ€™s first hearing, which was held on Feb. 6.
All three, including Shourd who was tried in absentia, entered
pleas of not guilty, their Iranian lawyer, Masoud Shafiei, said
at the time.  The continued detention of the two men is another point of
contention between Iran and the U.S., which accuses the Persian
Gulf country of seeking to build atomic weapons under cover of
its nuclear program. Iran rejects the claim and says it needs
the technology to secure energy for its growing population.  Shourd used to live with Bauer in the Syrian capital,
Damascus, where she learned Arabic and taught English, according
to  freethehikers.org . Bauer, 28, is a freelance journalist and
photographer, while Fattal, 28, is an environmentalist who was
visiting Damascus before they headed to  Iraq , according to the
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
