The following companies may have
unusual price changes in  South Korea . Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and share prices are from the previous close.  The  Kospi index (KOSPI)  fell 1.3 percent to 1,955.54.  Automakers: Nissan Motor Co., the second-largest Japanese
carmaker, said 2,300 new vehicles were damaged by tsunami surges
after the Japan’s worst earthquake on record. Toyota Motor Corp.
will suspend production at all 12 of its factories in Japan as
well as its body makers on March 14, spokeswoman  Shiori Hashimoto  said. Honda Motor Co. said it will stop production at
factories in Sayama, Mouka, Hamamatsu and Suzuka.  Hyundai Motor
Co. (005380)  (005380 KS), South Korea’s largest carmaker, fell 3.2
percent to 182,500 won.    Korean Reinsurance Co. (003690)  (003690 KS): The insurance company
will probably have a loss of less than 5 billion won ($4.4
million) after the quake in  Japan , the company said in a
statement on March 11. The stock fell 2.2 percent to 11,100 won.  Oil refiners, chemical companies: Japanese companies
including JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. and Cosmo Oil Co. have
shut more than 820,000 barrels a day of capacity, or about 19
percent of the country’s total processing ability. That will
reduce the supply of refined products such as diesel and gasoil,
or middle distillates, available for export from the country,
the third-largest crude consumer. SK Innovation Co. (096770 KS)
fell 2.9 percent to 186,000 won, while  Honam Petrochemical Corp. (011170) 
(011170 KS) declined 2.5 percent to 346,500 won.  Steel makers: JFE Steel Corp.’s Chiba plant was on fire
following the earthquake, an official from Chiba city’s fire
bureau said, while Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd, Japan’s third
largest steelmaker, said operations at blast furnaces at its
Kashima steel plant near Tokyo have been suspended. As Japan
accounts for more than 30 percent of South Korea’s annual steel
imports, its production losses will affect steel supply and
demand conditions in Korea, according to Hyundai Securities.  Hyundai Steel Co. (004020)  (004020 KS) fell 1.6 percent to 123,500 won.  To contact the reporters on this story:
