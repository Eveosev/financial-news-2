Vivendi SA may use funds from
selling its stake in  NBC Universal  to buy back control of
subsidiary SFR from Vodafone Plc, the Sunday Telegraph reported,
citing Vivendi’s Chief Executive Officer Jean-Bernard Levy.  Vivendi will only consider buying the 46 percent SFR stake
held by Vodafone for the "right price," Levy said, according to
the newspaper. The two companies may be negotiating a sale, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
