  Assetco Plc (ASTO) , the owner of  London ’s
fire engines, has rejected a second takeover approach from an
unidentified Arab investor, the  Sunday Times  reported, without
saying where it got its information.  The investor offered 20 pence a share and repayment of some
of the company’s debts, the newspaper said. The bid was rejected
in favor of raising money from shareholders, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
