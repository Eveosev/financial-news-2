  Hedge funds  increased bullish bets
on sugar to the highest in more than a year on expectations that
worldwide demand will increase.  In the week ended March 8, funds and money managers
increased net-long positions, or wagers on rising prices, by 18
percent to 153,941 contracts, the highest since February 2010,
government data showed on March 11. Futures in  New York  reached
a 30-year high last month on concern that global supplies will
trail demand after crop damage in Australia and India.  Last week,  Thailand , the world’s second-largest exporter,
sold a combined 92,000 metric tons to four trading companies in
an auction. Global food costs reached a record in February,
according to a United Nations index, stoking political unrest
that toppled governments in Tunisia and  Egypt .  Funds bought the commodity “on the expectation that food
prices would continue to rise,” said Phil Streible, a senior
strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker in Chicago. “Thailand had
supportive export data, which showed there’s still an appetite
for sugar.”  On March 11, raw sugar for May delivery gained 0.15 cent,
or 0.5 percent, to 28.86 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Sugar has tumbled 21 percent since reaching a 30-year
high of 36.08 cents on Feb. 2.  “They’re buying on the pullback, hoping prices would run
back up,” said Fain Shaffer, the president of Infinity Trading
Corp., a commodities brokerage in Medford, Oregon.  Brazil is the biggest exporter.  To contact the reporters on this story:
