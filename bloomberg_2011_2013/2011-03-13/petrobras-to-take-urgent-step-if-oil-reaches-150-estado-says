Petroleo Brasileiro SA may take an
“urgent” measure on domestic fuel policy if oil reaches $150 a
barrel, the company’s refining director told  O Estado de S.
Paulo  newspaper.  Petrobras, as the company is known, would adjust local fuel
prices if crude oil rises above a company-set level, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said, citing director Paulo Roberto Costa.
He didn’t indicate to the newspaper what that level is.  To contact the reporter on this story:
