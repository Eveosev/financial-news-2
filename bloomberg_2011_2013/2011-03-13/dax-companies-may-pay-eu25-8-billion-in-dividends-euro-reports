  Germany ’s DAX companies may pay as
much as 25.8 billion euro ($35.9 billion) in dividends to
shareholders as their profits increase amid the economic
recovery,  Euro am Sonntag  said, citing its own research.  The total amount paid by DAX companies will be about 25
percent higher than a year before, Euro am Sonntag said.  The newspaper’s calculations are based on 27 DAX companies
that have already reported yearly dividends and on estimates for
three companies -- HeidelbergCement AG, MAN SE and Metro AG --
that have yet to report dividends, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
