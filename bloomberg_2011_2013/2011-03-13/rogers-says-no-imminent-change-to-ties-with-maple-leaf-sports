  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  said it
doesn’t plan to change its relationship with Maple Leaf Sports
and Entertainment, after  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan  said it
may sell its controlling stake in the owner of the Toronto Maple
Leafs hockey team and Raptors basketball club.  Rogers, which owns Major League Baseball’s Toronto Blue
Jays, is “always looking to enhance the sports content we offer
our customers,” Rogers spokeswoman Jan Innes said in an e-mail.
The Toronto-based company has a long-standing sponsorship
arrangement with Maple Leaf Sports to which there’s no
“imminent change” planned, Innes said. The company does not
comment on rumor, she said.  Speculation about a sale of Maple Leaf Sports stake
accelerated in December after the Toronto Star reported the fund
wanted to sell Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment for C$1.3
billion ($1.34 billion) to Rogers,  Canada ’s largest wireless
carrier. Ontario Teachers’ yesterday confirmed in a press report
that it’s considering selling a 66 percent stake in Maple Leaf
Sports.  La Presse reported that the pension fund has hired  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  to find a buyer for the stake, looking to raise about
C$1.3 billion in a sale, the Montreal-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
