Brisbane Roar beat the Central
Coast Mariners 4-2 on penalties following a 2-2 tie in the A-
League grand final to win its first Australian soccer title.  In a matchup of the teams that finished first and second in
the regular-season standings, Henrique and Erik Paartalu scored
for the Roar in the last three minutes of extra time at Suncorp
Stadium, Brisbane, last night to set up a shootout.  Goalkeeper Michael Theoklitos then saved two penalties as
Brisbane extended its record unbeaten streak to 28 games.  “At one stage, we looked down and out,” Brisbane’s head
coach Ange Postecoglou told the A-League’s website. “We’ve had
an absolutely extraordinary season and I should’ve expected an
extraordinary finish.”  The Roar, who lost just one match all season, join Sydney
FC,  Melbourne  Victory and Newcastle Jets in winning the A-League
championship since the competition replaced  Australia ’s debt-
ridden National Soccer League in 2005. Sydney and Melbourne each
have two titles.  Central Coast fell to its third grand final loss after
losing to Sydney in 2006 and Melbourne two years later. Adam
Kwasnik and Oliver Bozanic got its goals in the first period of
extra time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
