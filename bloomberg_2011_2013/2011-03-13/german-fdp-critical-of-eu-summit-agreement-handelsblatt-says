German Free Democratic Party
finance expert  Frank Schaeffler  said the outcome of the European
Union summit that took place on March 11 is disappointing,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing an interview.  Schaeffler, whose party is in coalition with  Chancellor
Angela Merkel ’s Christian Democrats, told Handelsblatt online
that “the possibility for the EU rescue fund, the European
Financial Stability Facility, to buy junk bonds in the primary
market is a serious mistake.”  To contact the reporter on this story:  Julie Cruz  in  Frankfurt  at
