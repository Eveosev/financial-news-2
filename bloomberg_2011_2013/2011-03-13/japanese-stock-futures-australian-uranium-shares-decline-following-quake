Japanese stock futures and shares
of Australian uranium producers fell after  Japan ’s strongest
earthquake on record caused large-scale destruction in the
country’s northeast, including to nuclear power stations.  American depositary receipts of Hitachi Ltd., a Japanese
maker of nuclear-power plants, sank 2.8 percent from the last
closing share price in Tokyo after some reactors were damaged by
the quake. ADRs of Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and
Nissan Motor Co. retreated at least 2.4 percent after Japan’s
three-largest carmakers said thousands of new vehicles were
damaged. Those of Tokio Marine Holdings Inc., Japan’s largest
property and casualty insurer by market value, plunged 8.9
percent. Energy Resources of  Australia  Ltd., a uranium producer,
plunged 8.5 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,975 in  Chicago  on March 11, compared with
10,170 in  Osaka , Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,960
in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
declined 1 percent today.  New Zealand ’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.5
percent in Wellington.  “There should be an impact on companies’ production and
logistics, just as the Great Hanshin Earthquake did, and there’s
no doubt Japan’s economic indicators will worsen temporarily,”
said Toshio Sumitani, a strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research
Center, referring to a temblor that struck the city of Kobe in
1995.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.6 percent
today. In  New York , the index advanced 0.7 percent on March 11,
as gains in fuel, metal and industrial companies helped the
market overcome a global slump following Japan’s worst
earthquake on record.    Tokyo  Electric’s Reactors  The 8.9-magnitude temblor and subsequent tsunami may have
killed 10,000 people in Miyagi prefecture north of Tokyo,
national broadcaster NHK reported, citing local police. The
official toll reached 977, with 739 more missing and 1,683
injured, the  National Police Agency  said.  Radiation levels around the Tokyo Electric Power Co.
station in Fukushima, 135 miles north of the capital, rose after
cooling systems at a second reactor failed, heightening concerns
about a possible meltdown following an explosion there March 12.
Water levels fell at a third reactor, raising the possibility of
a hydrogen explosion, Japan’s top government spokesman said.  Tokyo Electric Power Co. will start service outages in
parts of the greater Tokyo area today, according to a statement.
The biggest supplier of electricity in the capital will divide
its service area into five groups, each with three-hour outages
from 6:20 a.m. to 10 p.m.  MSCI Asia Pacific    Bank of Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa told reporters
he’s ready to unleash “massive” liquidity starting this
morning in Tokyo to assure financial stability.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1.9 percent this year
through March 11, compared with a gain of 3.7 percent by the  S&P
500  and a drop of 0.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.6 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11 times for the Stoxx 600.  The yen appreciated to 81.63 against the dollar, compared
with 82.90 at the close of  stock trading  in Tokyo on March 11, a
level not seen since March 3. Against the euro, Japan’s currency
strengthened to as much as 112.93 after the quake from 114.61. A
stronger yen reduces income at Japanese companies when overseas
revenue is converted into their home currency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
