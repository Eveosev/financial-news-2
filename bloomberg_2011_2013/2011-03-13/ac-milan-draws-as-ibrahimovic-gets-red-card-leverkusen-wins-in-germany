Zlatan Ibrahimovic was red-carded
as AC Milan failed to stretch its lead in Italian soccer’s Serie
A, drawing 1-1 at home to bottom club Bari. Roma beat Lazio 2-0
in the city derby.  Gergely Rudolf gave Bari a first-half lead at Milan
yesterday and Antonio Cassano got the leveling goal eight
minutes from the end. Ibrahimovic was dismissed in the 73rd
minute after a clash with Marco Rossi.    Francesco Totti  got both goals for Roma, one from a last-
minute penalty kick.  AC Milan has 62 points, with city rival Inter Milan on 57
after a 1-1 draw at Brescia three days ago. Udinese and Napoli
have 53, Lazio 51 and Roma 49. Parma lost 3-1 at home to Napoli
in last night’s late game.  In  Spain , Barcelona failed to restore its seven-point lead
over Real Madrid with a 1-1 draw at Sevilla in yesterday’s late
game. Real defeated Hercules 2-0 two days ago, Karim Benzema
getting both goals.    Bayer Leverkusen  narrowed the gap on leader  Borussia
Dortmund  to nine points with a 1-0 win at Mainz yesterday.
Dortmund two days ago lost for only the third time in the league
this season, 1-0 at Hoffenheim.  Hamburg yesterday fired coach Armin Veh, a day after his
team lost 6-0 at Bayern Munich, Arjen Robben scoring three
goals. Veh had already said he’d leave at the end of the season.  Dortmund has 61 points, Leverkusen 52, Hanover 47 and
Bayern 45.  In  France , Lille took a three-point lead over Rennes with a
2-1 home win over Valenciennes, Eden Hazard scoring the injury-
time winner. Rennes lost 2-0 at home to Marseille three days
ago.  PSV Eindhoven has a one-point lead over  FC Twente  in the
Netherlands after drawing 2-2 at  NEC Nijmegen . Twente beat VVV-
Venlo 2-1. Ajax is two points further back after a 3-1 victory
