  Iraq  will resume crude oil exports
to  Turkey  within 24 hours after shipments were stopped by a bomb
attack four days ago, according to Emad al-Baqer,  North Oil
Co. ’s head of production.  Workers are replacing parts of the pipeline to allow
exports from Iraq’s northern Kirkuk oilfields to Turkey’s
Mediterranean port of Ceyhan to resume, he said. "Repair works
will not take more than 24 hours and exports will start after
that," he said in a telephone interview from Kirkuk today.  The sabotage on the 600-mile (965-kilometer) pipeline
knocked out as much as a quarter of the country’s crude exports,
or about 590,000 barrels a day. The disruption came at a time
when oil supplies into Mediterranean Sea ports were reduced by
the unrest in  Libya . The  International Energy Agency  estimated
Libyan exports have dropped by at least 1 million barrels a day
since the unrest there began.  Iraq’s oil exports last month rose 2 percent to 2.2 million
barrels a day, the highest since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003,
after shipments from the northern Kurdish region resumed Feb. 3
following a halt of more than a year due to a dispute between
the central government and the semi-autonomous region.  Daily shipments in February included 484,000 barrels a day
from Kirkuk, Falah al-Amri, head of the country’s  State Oil
Marketing Organization , said in a March 1 interview. Iraq pumped
2.6 million barrels a day in February, according to Bloomberg
estimates.  Iraq’s biggest refinery restarted operations this month
after a sabotage on Feb. 26 in which four engineers were killed
in the first assault on the 250,000 barrel-a-day refinery in the
northern city of Baiji since the 2003 invasion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
