  Sudan ’s ruling party said today it
will recognize  Southern Sudan  after its sovereignty is declared
on July 9 even as post-independence talks were suspended.  The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, Southern Sudan’s
ruling party, said it will halt talks over arrangements with the
north, and that it’s studying other ways of exporting oil from
July other than through the north, currently the only export
route.  “We are not going to change our position simply because
some of the irresponsible SPLM officials or elements had decided
to say what they have said,” Al-Derdiri Mohamed Ahmed, a senior
official at President Umar al-Bashir’s National Congress Party
told reporters today in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital.    Southern Sudan  holds about three-quarters of Sudan’s
current oil production of 490,000 barrels a day, pumped mainly
by China National Petroleum Corp., Malaysia’s Petroliam Nasional
Bhd. and  India ’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp.  Sudan had 5 billion
barrels of proven oil reserves as of January 2010, according to
the  U.S. Energy Information Administration .  To contact the reporter on this story:
