French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is
the least popular right-wing president ever in  France , an Ifop
survey for the  Journal du Dimanche  showed.  The president’s disapproval rating climbed to  71 percent 
from 69 percent in February, the weekly newspaper reported
today, citing an opinion  poll  by the Paris-based institute.
That’s higher than the disapproval rating of 70 percent garnered
by former President  Jacques Chirac  in 2005 and 2006, according
to the newspaper. Sarkozy’s approval rating slumped to 29
percent this month from 31 percent in February, the poll showed.  All the most recent polls in France have shown Sarkozy’s
popularity to be at record lows. Other surveys also have pointed
to higher approval ratings for Marine Le Pen, daughter of the
National Front’s historic leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, and
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss- Kahn, the potential opposition Socialist party candidate to
Sarkozy in next year’s presidential race.  Ifop polled 1,889 people of 18 years or older from March 3
to March 11, the weekly newspaper said. No margin of error was
given.  Prime Minister Francois Fillon’s support rate also is lower
this month, according to Ifop. The proportion of dissatisfied
respondents climbed by one percentage point to 51 percent, the
survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
