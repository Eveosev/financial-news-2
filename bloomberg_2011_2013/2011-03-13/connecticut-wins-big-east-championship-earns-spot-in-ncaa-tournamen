Kemba Walker scored 19 points as
the  University of Connecticut  defeated the University of
Louisville 69-66 for the Big East championship and a berth in
the national basketball tournament.  The Huskies (26-9, 9-9 Big East) won their seventh title
in 10 trips to the conference final to tie Georgetown University
for the most championships.  Connecticut  also became the first
school to win five games in five days, earning the conference
title that comes with an automatic berth in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  Walker, a junior guard, accumulated 130 points in those
five games, 46 more than the record.  Preston Knowles scored 18 points for the Cardinals (25-9,
12-6 Big East). He missed a 3-point attempt at the buzzer that
would have tied the game at Madison Square Garden in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
