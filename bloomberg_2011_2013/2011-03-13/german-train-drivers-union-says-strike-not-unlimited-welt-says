Rolling strike action on  Germany â€™s
rail network implemented by members of the GDL train drivers
union may last a month,  Welt am Sonntag  said, citing an
interview with GDL Chairman Claus Weselsky.  The union has a different strategy from that used during
industrial action in 2007 and is synchronizing the strike
periods to occur more quickly one after another, Weselsky told
the newspaper. There will be no unlimited strike period, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
