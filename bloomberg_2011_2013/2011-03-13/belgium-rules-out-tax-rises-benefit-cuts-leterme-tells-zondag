  Belgium ’s budget for 2011 will
contain “no tax increases and no cuts in benefits, child
benefits or pensions,”  De Zondag  reported, citing an interview
with Prime Minister Yves Leterme.  Belgium needs to cut “hundreds of millions” of euros in
the government’s running costs, Leterme told the newspaper. The
government will also look at the country’s social security
system, “without taking a euro from people,” he added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
