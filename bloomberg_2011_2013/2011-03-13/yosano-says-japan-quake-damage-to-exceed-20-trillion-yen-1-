Japan’s Economic and Fiscal Policy
Minister  Kaoru Yosano  said the impact of the earthquake and
tsunami that struck Mar. 11 will hit the economy in its core.  Yosano said the government still has 1.3 trillion yen
($15.8 billion) in discretionary funds from this year’s budget
that can be allocated for quake relief. Yosano was speaking at
a press conference in  Tokyo .  “This earthquake affected a wide area, and it’s likely
that the economic impact will exceed the 20 trillion yen in
damage sustained during the Kobe earthquake” of 1995, Yosano
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
