  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest
bank, said it suspended an employee over an alleged incident in
connection with a  National Health Service  workers’ protest in
London against job cuts.  An unidentified Deutsche Bank employee was photographed
waving a 10 pound note ($16.08) at marchers as they passed the
bank’s offices on March 8, the Sunday Mirror  said , citing Ron
Singer, chairman of the Medical Practitioners’ Union. The
newspaper published the photograph today and said a copy had
been given to the bank.  “These photos appear to show conduct that is unacceptable
and unrepresentative of our bank,”  Michael Golden , a London-
based spokesman for Deutsche Bank, said in an e-mailed
statement. “We are looking into the matter, have suspended the
individual involved and will hold him accountable for his
actions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
