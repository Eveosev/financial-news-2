Electricite de France SA is not
willing to accept a veto by Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti over power company  Edison SpA (EDN) ,  Le Journal du Dimanche 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  EDF Chief Executive Officer  Henri Proglio  is determined to
pursue talks with Italian shareholders of Edison and has no
intention of accepting the veto by Tremonti, who opposes ceding
control of Edison to EDF, JDD said.  Paris-based EDF controls about 50 percent of Edison and has
been pushing for more management control over the power company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
