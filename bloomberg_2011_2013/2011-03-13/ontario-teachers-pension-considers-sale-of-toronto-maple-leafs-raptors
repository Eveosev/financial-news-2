The  Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan 
said it’s considering selling its 66 percent stake in the
company that owns the  Toronto Maple Leafs  National Hockey League
team and the Raptors basketball club.  Ontario Teachers’ spokeswoman Deborah Allan declined to
provide further details in an e-mailed statement today. La
Presse reported earlier today that the pension fund has hired  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to find a buyer for the stake, looking to raise
about C$1.3 billion ($1.33 billion) in a sale, the Montreal-
based newspaper said.  A sale of the Toronto Maple Leafs, which has won the
Stanley Cup 11 times, would give a potential buyer one of
professional hockey’s most valuable franchises, according to
Forbes.com. The team was founded in 1917.  Speculation about a sale of the Leafs stake accelerated in
December after the Toronto Star reported the fund wanted to sell
Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment for C$1.3 billion to  Rogers
Communications Inc. (RCI/B) ,  Canada ’s largest wireless carrier.  Ontario Teachers’ bought an additional 7.7 percent stake in
Maple Leaf Sports in August 2009, boosting its ownership to 66
percent, the Toronto-based company said at the time.  Ontario Teachers’, Canada’s third-biggest retirement fund
manager, has more than C$100 billion in assets.  Maple Leafs Sports also owns the Toronto FC soccer team,
the Air Canada Centre arena and the Toronto Marlies junior
hockey team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
