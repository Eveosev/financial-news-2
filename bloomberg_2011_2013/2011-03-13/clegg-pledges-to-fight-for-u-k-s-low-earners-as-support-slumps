Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg
will pledge his backing for low wage earners as he seeks to
rebuild his Liberal Democrat Party’s support after its recent
erosion as a result of the U.K. coalition government’s austerity
program.  “In government, especially in difficult times, it is more
important than ever to know whose side you are on,” Clegg will
tell his party’s conference in Sheffield, northern  England ,
today, according to extracts of his speech released in advance.
“When money is tight you have to make choices. And the only way
to get them right is to know who you are making those choices
for.”  Clegg will say he wants to fight for “alarm clock
Britain,” a group he defines as people “who want to get up and
get on.”  While the Liberal Democrats polled 23 percent of the vote
in the May 2010 general election and entered a coalition with
the Conservatives, the party slumped to sixth place in a special
parliamentary election on March 3.  A poll by ComRes Ltd. in today’s Independent on Sunday
shows the party’s popularity at 11 percent, compared with 37
percent for the Conservatives and 40 percent for the opposition  Labour Party .  ComRes interviewed 2,004 adults online March 9-10. No error
margin was given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
