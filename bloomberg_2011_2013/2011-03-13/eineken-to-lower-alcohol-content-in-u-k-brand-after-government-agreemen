  Heineken NV (HEIA) , the world’s third-
largest brewer, will lower the alcohol content of one of its
major brands in the U.K. after signing a government health
agreement to help reduce misuse.  The brewer, which sells Heineken, Foster’s, Strongbow and  John Smith ’s, aims to remove 100 million units of alcohol from
the U.K. market each year through lowering the strength of a
major brand by 2013, it said in a statement today, without
specifying which brand.  The Amsterdam-based brewer will also show alcohol unit
information on 11 million branded glasses in the U.K. by the end
of this year.  “These two pledges represent a great start to what we hope
will be a long term shared plan to improve alcohol awareness and
reduce alcohol harm,” Stefan Orlowski, Heineken UK’s managing
director, said in the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
