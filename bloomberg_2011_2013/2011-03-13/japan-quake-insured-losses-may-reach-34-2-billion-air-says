The insured property losses from
the 8.9-magnitude earthquake that struck  Japan  on March 11 may
be as much as 2.8 trillion yen ($34.2 billion), according to a
preliminary estimate by disaster modeler  AIR Worldwide .  The company used a variety of scenarios including a range
from 8.9 to 9.1 in magnitude, a depth of between 15 kilometers
(9 miles) and 30 kilometers and a rupture width of 100
kilometers to 150 kilometers, AIR said in an e-mailed statement.  AIR said its preliminary range of 1.2 trillion to 2.8
trillion yen doesn’t include damage caused by tsunami waves of 3
meters (9 feet) or higher that battered the northeastern coast,
especially Fukushima, Ibaraki, Iwate and Miyagi prefectures.
Some tsunami surges reached as far as 10 kilometers inland, AIR
said.  The company said 14 percent to 17 percent of structures in
Japan have earthquake insurance. About 70 percent of all
residential buildings are made of wood and about 25 percent
concrete, while commercial construction is about 50 percent
concrete, with about one-third light metal or steel and less
than 10 percent of wood, the firm said.  Separately, the  Bank of Japan  may inject more short-term
cash into the banking system after the nation’s most powerful
earthquake on record, while keeping its asset-purchase plans
unchanged as officials gauge the longer-term effect on the
world’s third-largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Dan Hart  in  Washington  at
