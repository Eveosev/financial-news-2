  Douglas Davis  hit a jump shot at
the buzzer to give  Princeton University  a 63-62 win over  Harvard
University  and a berth in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association men’s basketball tournament after a six-year absence.  Harvard, which claimed a share of its first Ivy League
title this season, was trying to reach the tournament for the
first time since 1946.  Davis scored 15 points as the Tigers (25-6) clinched the
Ivy League’s automatic berth in the 68-team NCAA tournament.
Harvard (23-6) and Princeton tied for the Ivy League title with
12-2 conference records.  “I was able to get open, took a couple dribbles, felt good,
went in, then fell on the ground which was the worst decision I
ever made because everyone jumped on me,” Davis said during
last night’s postgame news conference.  Harvard went on a 14-5 run at the end of the first half to
take a 32-25 lead at the break.  “I don’t think that we played very hard in the first
half,” said Princeton coach Sydney Johnson. “In the second, we
played with emotion.”  Davis’s 3-point shot with five minutes, 20 seconds left in
the game put Princeton ahead 51-50. The teams then traded leads
in the final minute as Ian Hummer gave Princeton a 61-60
advantage with 37 seconds left. Harvard’s Brandyn Curry made it
62-61 with 10 seconds left before Davis scored as time expired.  Sinking Heart  “It was a dagger, your heart just sinks, certainly a tough
moment for all of us, but congratulations to them,” Harvard
coach Tommy Amaker said during his postgame press conference.  Amaker hopes Harvard is one of 32 teams to get a bid for
the National Invitation Tournament, which begins March 15 and
ends March 31 with the championship at Madison Square Garden in
New York.  Keith Wright was the high-scorer for the Crimson with 16
points.  The one-game playoff today was held on a neutral court at  Yale University ’s Lee Amphitheater in  New Haven ,  Connecticut ,
equidistant from the campuses in Princeton,  New Jersey , and
Cambridge,  Massachusetts .  The Tigers have won or shared 26 Ivy League titles and
reached the NCAA semifinals in 1965. Princeton’s previous trip
to the tournament was in 2004. Harvard has made one trip to the
NCAA tournament, losing its only two games in 1946 -- one a
consolation contest.  Princeton, which has had 12 Nobel Prize winners on its
faculty, has sent two players to the Basketball Hall of Fame --
Bill Bradley and coach Pete Carril.  Harvard, whose faculty has won 34 Nobel Prizes, has
produced more U.S. presidents (eight) than NBA players (four),
according to the school.  To contact the reporters on this story:
