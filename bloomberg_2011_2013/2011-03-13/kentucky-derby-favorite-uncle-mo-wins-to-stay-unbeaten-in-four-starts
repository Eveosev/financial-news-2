Undefeated Uncle Mo, the 2011  Kentucky  Derby favorite and reigning juvenile champion, won the
$100,000 Timely Writer Stakes in his 3-year-old debut.  Uncle Mo, a 1-9 favorite who left the starting gate a half-
step behind four rivals yesterday, covered the mile in one
minute, 36.56 seconds to finish 3 ½ lengths ahead of Rattlesnake
Bridge at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach,  Florida .  Owned by Glaceau Vitaminwater co-founder Mike Repole and
trained by  Todd Pletcher , Uncle Mo won the $2 million Breeders’
Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs on Nov. 6 in Louisville,
Kentucky. The Timely Writer Stakes was the colt’s first race
since.  “He broke terrible, banged into another horse and then
four steps later he was out in front,” Repole said in a
telephone interview. “As he went further, he got stronger;
every eighth of a mile was faster than the last. He did what he
had to do today.”  The winning colt, who is undefeated in four starts, paid
$2.10 on a $2 bet, Rattlesnake Bridge returned $2.20, while
Gallant Dreams was third to pay $3.  Uncle Mo is scheduled to be entered in the $750,000 Wood
Memorial at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens,  New York , on April 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
