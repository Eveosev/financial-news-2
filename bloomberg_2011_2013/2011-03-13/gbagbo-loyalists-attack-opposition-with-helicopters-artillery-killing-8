At least eight people were killed
yesterday after security forces loyal to incumbent Ivory Coast
President  Laurent Gbagbo  attacked an Abidjan neighborhood
populated by his opponents, a local official said.  “The fighting was very intense,” said Kennedy Toure, deputy
mayor of Abobo, the neighborhood where the incident occurred.
“We heard artillery and sustained gunfire while helicopters were
bombarding the area,” he said.  Residents of Abobo voted heavily for  Alassane Ouattara , the
internationally recognized victor of the nation’s disputed
presidential election last November.  A group calling itself the Liberation Movement for the
Population of Abobo-Anyama said it attacked army officers on
Feb. 22.  The helicopters in yesterday’s skirmish appeared to be
targeting the positions of the Liberation Movement, Toure said.  Almost 400 people have been killed in Ivory Coast since the
political crisis started more than three months ago, according
to the  United Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
