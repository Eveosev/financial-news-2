Tokai Village’s Tokai Dai-Ni power
plant in Ibaraki Prefecture has halted its cooling pump system
because the facility automatically stopped its operations as a
result of  Japan ’s biggest earthquake,  Kyodo News  reported,
citing a filing to the prefecture.  A Japanese agency overseeing safety for nuclear power
plants said the reactor core is being cooled without problem,
Kyodo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
