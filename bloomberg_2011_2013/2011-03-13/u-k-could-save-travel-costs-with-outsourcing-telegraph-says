The U.K. government could save
millions of pounds by outsourcing travel arrangements to a
private contractor, according to Capita Group Plc, the Sunday
Telegraph reported.  The government needs to standardize rules for who gets
first class accommodation, ensure that these rules are followed
and set up a single standard that works across departments, the
newspaper said, citing Capita Chief Executive Officer Paul Pindar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
