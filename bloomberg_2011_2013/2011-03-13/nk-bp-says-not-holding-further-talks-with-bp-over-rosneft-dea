TNK-BP said it isn’t holding
further talks with  BP Plc (BP/)  over the London-based company’s
proposed venture with OAO Rosneft.  TNK-BP said in an e-mailed statement today that it expects
an arbitration tribunal decision in the next several weeks over
their dispute. The Moscow-based joint venture between BP and its
Russian billionaire partners said yesterday an earlier court
injunction stopping BP from proceeding with the Rosneft deal
remains in place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
