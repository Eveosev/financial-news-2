  Michel Barnier , European Union
internal markets commissioner, wants to apply a strict
separation between business audit and consultancy in the EU,
WirtschaftsWoche reported, citing an interview.  “The combination of audit and strategic consulting creates
doubts about the independence of an auditor,” Barnier told the
magazine. The auditor “should have no commercial interest in
the company whose books it reviews,” WiWo cited him as saying.  As a consequence, companies like PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, KPMG LLP, Ernst & Young LLP and Deloitte LLP should drop
some parts of their business, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
