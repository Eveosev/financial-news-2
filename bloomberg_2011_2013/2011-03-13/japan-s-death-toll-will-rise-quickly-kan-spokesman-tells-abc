(Corrects location of power plant in third paragraph.)    Japan ’s death toll from last week’s
8.9-magnitude earthquake and ensuing tsunami will rise from the
current count of about 1,000, a spokesman for Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said.  The number of confirmed dead “will be increasing very
quickly,” the spokesman, Nori Shikata, said today in a
telephone  interview  on ABC’s “This Week.” He didn’t provide an
estimate for the potential death toll.  The crisis may be Japan’s worst since World War II, Kan
said yesterday in a nationally televised press conference in  Tokyo . The earthquake and subsequent tsunami may have killed
10,000 people in Miyagi prefecture north of Tokyo, national
broadcaster NHK reported, citing local police. Officials also
are trying to contain the natural disaster’s damage to a nuclear
power plant in Fukushima prefecture.  “We don’t call this situation a meltdown,” Shikata said
in the ABC interview. “This is a regulated controlled
situation. The release of minute radioactive material is based
on our efforts to take precautionary methods.”  The U.S.,  South Korea  and Singapore are among 71 countries
and regions have offered assistance to Japan, Shikata said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
