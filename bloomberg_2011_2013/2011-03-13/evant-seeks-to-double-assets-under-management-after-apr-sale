Levant Capital Ltd., a Dubai-based
private equity company, aims to double assets under management
to more than $400 million by the end of this year after
announcing the first sale from its debut fund.  Levant said today it sold its “significant minority
stake” in U.S.-based temporary-power producer  APR Energy  to
funds managed by  Soros Fund Management  and Albright Capital
Management. The sale generated a return of 40 percent and
resulted in the new investors committing $250 million to APR,
Chief Executive Officer Salameh Sweis said in a phone interview
today.  Five-year-old Levant currently manages about $200 million
and invests in small and mid-size companies that benefit from
growth opportunities in the Middle East, Sweis, 37, a former
banker at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in  New York , said. It has
invested about $150 million in four deals up to now, he said.  Levant invested in APR Energy in 2009 and the sale “is
important in terms of bringing capital back to our investors and
showing them what we can do,” Sweis said. The company expects
to complete two investments this year with an average size of
about $50 million each, he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
