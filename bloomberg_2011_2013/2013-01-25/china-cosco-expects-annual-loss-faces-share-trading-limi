China Cosco Holdings Co. (1919) , the
nation’s biggest shipping company, dropped the most in more than
two months after saying it faces trading restrictions on its
 China  shares amid a forecast for a “significant” loss in 2012.  The company’s Hong Kong-traded  stock  dropped 5.1 percent,
the most since Nov. 8, to close at HK$4.08. The city’s benchmark
 Hang Seng Index  rose 0.4 percent.  The company may get a “special treatment” designation and
investors should be aware of risks, China Cosco said in a  filing 
to  Shanghai stock exchange  on Jan. 25, without specifying the
amount of the loss. The Tianjin, China-based company posted a
net loss of  4.87 billion yuan  ($782 million) in the first half
of 2012 and a loss of 10.5 billion  yuan  in 2011.  China Cosco is expected to have  a 6.5 billion yuan  net loss
for 2012, based on the average of eight analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The shipping company is contending with
higher fuel costs and slumping freight rates because of
worldwide overcapacity. The Baltic-Dry Index, a measure of
global commodity-shipping rates, slumped to a 25-year low last
year, prompting  Korea line Corp. (005880)  and Sanko Steamship Co. of
 Japan  to seek court protection.  Rising Debt  “We see little reason to be positive in the shares,”
Barclays Plc analysts  Jon Windham  and Esme Pau wrote in a note
dated Jan. 27. “The declining equity base and rising  debt
burden  will need to be addressed in 2013.”  The analysts maintained an underweight  rating  on the Hong
Kong-traded stock with a target price of HK$3.32.  China Cosco’s Shanghai-traded  shares  rose 0.5 percent to
close at 4.34 yuan as the city’s benchmark Shanghai Stock
Exchange Composite Index jumped 2.4 percent today.  The daily trading limit for companies with a “special
treatment” designation will be cut to 5 percent from 10
percent, according to  rules  posted by the Shanghai Stock
Exchange. Companies that post annual losses for two consecutive
years get that designation.  If China Cosco posts another loss this year, the company’s
A-shares may run the risk of being suspended from trading in
Shanghai and also face the possibility of getting delisted,
according to Citigroup Inc. analyst Vivian Tao. A rescue by the
parent company or the government is “highly likely” to help
avoid a delisting, Tao wrote in a note to clients today.  China Shipping Container Lines Co., the container shipping
unit of China’s second-largest shipping company, said earlier
this month that it expected to make a profit in 2012, compared
with a net loss a year earlier. China Shipping fell 2.5 percent
to HK$2.37 in  Hong Kong  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
