JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  had its price
target and recommendation raised by Deutsche Bank AG while
investors were advised to hold on to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
following its 48 percent stock-price rise since Aug. 2.  JPMorgan shares have  lagged  30 percent behind global banks
since early August, analysts led by Matthew O’Connor wrote in a
research note by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank. JPMorgan, which
reported its third record year of profits with $21.3 billion in
net income last year, may see annual operating expenses drop as
much as $5 billion in coming years partly because costs to
service mortgages will drop, according to the note.  “We think JPM is the best-positioned market-sensitive bank
for a pickup in consumer loan growth,” O’Connor wrote,
referring to New York-based JPMorgan by its stock ticker.
Deutsche Bank upgraded JPMorgan to buy from hold and raised its
12-month  price target  to $53 from $48.  Deutsche Bank lowered Goldman Sachs to hold from buy
because the New York-based bank is trading close to its 12-month
price target of $144. The firm doesn’t have the same
opportunities for cost savings as JPMorgan, and is trading at a
premium to other large investment banks, O’Connor said in the
note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
