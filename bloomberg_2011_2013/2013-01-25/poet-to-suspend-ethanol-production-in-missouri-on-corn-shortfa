Poet LLC, the largest U.S. ethanol
maker, will suspend production at a plant in  Missouri  because
drought conditions have ravaged local corn supplies.  There’s no timeline for resuming production at the Macon
facility, closely held Poet said today in an e-mailed statement.
While operations will stop Feb. 1, all of the plant’s 44 workers
will remain employed “at their current hours,” Poet said.  The Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based company will install
about $14.5 million in plant upgrades while operations are
suspended, and some of the current employees will assist,
according to the statement.  “It’s investments like these that will ensure continued
long-term success for the plant,” John Eggleston, president of
the board, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
