European Union Budget Commissioner
Janusz Lewandowski pleaded with national leaders not to make
further reductions in the bloc’s next seven-year budget.  A proposal for 1.033 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion) in
spending between 2014 and 2020 was cut to 973 billion euros in
November and further cuts are likely when EU leaders meet Feb.
7-8 to hammer out a final package, he said.  “It’s not good for  Europe  because we badly need
investment,” Lewandowski said at the European Policy Centre in
Brussels today. “We could destroy the capacity of the European
budget.”  Wealthier countries such as  Germany , the U.K., Denmark,
 Sweden  and the Netherlands have already seen to it that the new
budget -- devoted mainly to infrastructure projects and farm aid
-- will decrease for the first time in EU history.  The donor countries are now skirmishing over who pays how
much, with Denmark insisting that it is entitled to the same
rebate as the U.K., Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden.  Lewandowski’s earlier proposals to replace the patchwork of
refunds with a more streamlined revenue-raising system were
rejected by the rich countries.  “The present system of rebates, built on the British
rebate, is complicated enough,” Lewandowski said. He deemed
 Denmark  “not a candidate for corrections,” while conceding
that the question will be decided “politically” by national
leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
