Kansai Electric Power Co., which
supplies  Japan ’s second-biggest metropolitan area, may have to
spend at least 285 billion yen ($3.1 billion) to improve the
safety of its nuclear-power plants, President Makoto Yagi said.  The nation’s most nuclear-reliant utility may have to
further increase the expenditure to meet the Nuclear Regulation
Authority’s new safety standards for atomic-power stations, Yagi
told reporters today in Tokyo, without giving comparable a
number or a timeline.  Kansai Electric, based in  Osaka , asked for higher
electricity rates in November to cover the rising cost of fuel
firing its thermal power plants while most of its reactors
remained offline. Under the regulator’s new requirements to be
implemented in July, Kansai Electric and its peers must
implement additional safety measures before restarting their
reactors.  Of the estimated spending, Kansai Electric plans to invest
about 195 billion yen in the three years ending March 2016,
according to the utility’s  plan  submitted to the government.
Under Japanese law, the three-year investment cost would be
passed on to customers, should the government approve Kansai
Electric’s rate-increase request.  To contact the reporter on this story:
