General Motors Co. (GM) , which isn’t
advertising on CBS during the National Football League’s Super
Bowl, plans to air commercials during the television network’s
pre-game programming Feb. 3, the automaker said.  GM’s mass-market Chevrolet brand will have four spots
during that time, Chris Perry, vice president for Chevy
marketing, said yesterday in an interview in Detroit.  The automaker garnered attention last year when then-Chief
Marketing Officer Joel Ewanick decided the company wouldn’t
advertise during the NFL championship game because it wasn’t
worth the high cost. Detroit-based GM is introducing about 20
new vehicles in the U.S. this year, including 13 Chevrolet
models.  The company spent $1.17 billion on U.S. advertising during
the first three quarters of last year, according to Kantar
Media. The CBS network is part of  CBS Corp. (CBS)   The average cost of a 60-second commercial on last year’s
Super Bowl was $7 million, according to NBC, which broadcast
that game and said it drew 111.3 million viewers, the most in
U.S. television history. The Feb. 3 contest to be televised by
CBS will be in New Orleans.  Ford Motor Co. (F) , GM’s Dearborn, Michigan-based competitor,
is using this year’s Super Bowl broadcast as part of a marketing
effort to revive its Lincoln luxury brand. Ford will debut a 60-
second Lincoln spot during the game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
