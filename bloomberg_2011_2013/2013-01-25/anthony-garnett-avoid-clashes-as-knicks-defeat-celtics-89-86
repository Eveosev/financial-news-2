Carmelo Anthony had 28 points and
nine rebounds while avoiding further clashes with  Kevin Garnett 
as the  New York Knicks  beat the Celtics 89-86 to snap an 11-game
losing streak in Boston.  J.R. Smith made a 3-pointer with one minute, 10 seconds
remaining to put New York ahead 89-84 at TD Garden last night.
The Knicks hung on for the win after  Rajon Rondo  completed the
scoring for the Celtics with 39 seconds to play.  Anthony was suspended for one game by the National
Basketball Association for confronting Garnett after Boston beat
New York 102-96 on Jan. 7 at Madison Square Garden. Anthony was
booed every time he got the ball in the first half last night,
with a loud cheer greeting Garnett’s block of a layup by
Anthony. At one point, Anthony extended a hand to help Garnett
get to his feet.  The Knicks (26-14) remain atop the Eastern Conference’s
five-team Atlantic Division, one game ahead of the Brooklyn Nets
(26-16). The Celtics (20-22), are seven games back after losing
five straight.  A’mare Stoudemire added 15 points for the Knicks, while
Rondo had 23 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists for Boston.  Paul Pierce  contributed 22 points for the Celtics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
