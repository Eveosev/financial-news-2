NTS Holding Plc , a Russian freight
carrier, said it has postponed investor meetings to market a
planned initial public offering in London.  “I’m not going to investor meetings in London next week as
planned,” Konstantin Vyazovskiy, head of  investor relations  at
the Moscow-based company, said by phone today, without providing
further details.  NefteTransService, as the company is known, said in a Jan.
15 filing it is seeking to sell global depositary receipts
equivalent to 25 percent of the company’s shares in the first
half of the year. The company aims to raise $500 million, a
person with knowledge of the plans, who asked not to be
identified before the deal is completed, said at the time.  “Right now is a complicated time for the market,” Andrey Vashevnik, chief investment officer at Moscow-based R&B
Investment Fund Ltd., said by phone. “The market is very
volatile and companies have to be extra careful about the price
they set for an IPO. It’s better to sit it out.”  NTS operates about 60,000 railcars since acquiring a rail
unit of billionaire Roman Abramovich’s steelmaker  Evraz Plc (EVR)  two
months ago. The company is majority owned by Vyacheslav Aminov,
who once worked as an aide to  Boris Yeltsin  and Vladimir Putin’s
chief of staff, and his brother Vadim, according to the
 Vedomosti  newspaper.  NTS hired  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and
 Renaissance Capital  to manage the sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
