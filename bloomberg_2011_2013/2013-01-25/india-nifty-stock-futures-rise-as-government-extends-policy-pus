Indian (SENSEX)  stocks rallied to a two-year
high, erasing a weekly loss, as carmakers and lenders increased
ahead of the central bank policy meeting next week.  The BSE  India  Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose 0.9 percent
to 20,103.53 at the close. The gauge climbed 0.3 percent this
week.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the biggest carmaker, surged to
a three-year high after third-quarter profit exceeded analysts’
estimates.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the owner of Jaguar Land Rover,
jumped 2.6 percent, ending a five day, 11-percent drop.  State
Bank of India Ltd. , the nation’s biggest lender, increased 2.2
percent, the most since Dec. 14.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s administration took a step
yesterday to spur inflows and avert a debt-rating downgrade by
increasing a limit on foreign investment in rupee bonds by $10
billion to $75 billion. The  Reserve Bank  of India will cut the
benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 7.75 percent on Jan. 29,
according to 15 of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Two
analysts forecast a 50 basis-point cut.  “We would be happy if the central bank is slow in cutting
 interest rates  as India is still prone to inflationary risks,”
Gary Dugan, chief investment officer for  Asia  and  Middle East  at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc’s wealth management unit, told
Bloomberg TV India today. “We would be comfortable” with a 25
basis point rate cut by the RBI next week.  Consumer-price inflation accelerated to 10.56 percent in
December, the second-highest level among the Group of 20 major
economies, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Core inflation  eased
to 4.19 percent from 4.49 percent in November, according to
calculations by Bloomberg. The RBI has left its benchmark rate
at 8 percent since a 50 basis-point cut in April 2012.  Carmakers Rally  Tata Motors, the best performer on the Sensex last year,
increased 2.6 percent to 301 rupees.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) ,
India’s largest maker of sport-utility vehicles, gained 2.8
percent to 901.5 rupees.  Maruti Suzuki soared 3.9 percent to 1,599.45 rupees, the
highest level since Dec. 14, 2009. Third-quarter  net income  at
 Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) ’s Indian unit more than doubled to 5.01
billion rupees ($93 million), beating the 4.89 billion-rupee
median of 38  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Only two out of 13, or 15 percent, of Sensex members that
have reported December-quarter earnings have missed forecasts,
compared with 40 percent in the previous two quarters, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has advanced 3.5 percent this year, extending
last year’s 26 percent jump, as government efforts to open up
more industries to overseas investment and cut fuel subsidies
lured foreign funds. The gauge trades at 16.9 times reported
earnings, the most expensive since July 2011.  ‘Right Policies’  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is on a tour of
Asia and Europe to woo investors. He pledged to deepen a policy
overhaul that lured foreigners to invest $24.5 billion into
domestic shares last year, the most among the 10 Asian markets
tracked by Bloomberg, excluding China. The inflows helped fuel
the  biggest annual increase  in the Sensex since 2009.  “It’s not always simple to invest in India and get the
full support of government policies,” RBS’s Dugan said. “At
the moment the policies are in the right direction, and for a
foreign investor look very attractive.”  Dugan said he expects the 50-stock S&P CNX  Nifty Index (NIFTY)  on
the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. to rally to a record
6,600 by December this year. The Nifty jumped 0.9 percent to
6,074.65 at the close.  The India VIX index, which gauges the cost of protection
against losses in the Nifty, added 2.1 percent to 14.77. Volumes
on the Sensex exceeded the 30-day average by 13 percent.  Overseas funds were  net buyers  of local stocks for an 19th
straight day on Jan. 23, purchasing a net $151.5 million, data
from the regulator show. They have bought a net $3.01 billion of
stocks this year, a record for the period, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
