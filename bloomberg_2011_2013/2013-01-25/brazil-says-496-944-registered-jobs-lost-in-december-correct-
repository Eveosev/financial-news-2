(Corrects number of jobs lost in first paragraph.)  Brazilâ€™s economy lost 496,944
government-registered jobs in December, the Labor Ministry
announced today in Brasilia.  Economists forecast a reduction of 401,500 jobs, according
to the median estimate from 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Last year, in December, jobs fell by 408,172 posts.  Government-registered job creation number is a balance of
posts created minus job eliminated. Registered jobs, so-called
formal work, assure employees a range of benefits such as
unemployment insurance, bonuses and retirement payments by the
government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
