Commerzbank AG (CBK) ,  Germany ’s second-
biggest bank, clashed with the country’s cooperative banks over
its policy of offering cash incentives to customers.  Such business models are “crazy” and aren’t sustainable,
Uwe Froehlich, head of the BVR association of German cooperative
banks, said in a speech at a conference in Frankfurt today.
Commerzbank offers clients 50 euros ($67) for opening an account 
and an additional 50 euros if they're unhappy with the bank's 
services, according to its website.   European banks have turned to consumers and businesses to
help raise capital after borrowing on financial markets became
more expensive due to the  European debt crisis . Germany owns 25
percent plus one share of Commerzbank after taxpayers rescued
the company during the financial crisis, meaning the government
has voting rights on its board of directors.  “We’d prefer our politicians and Commerzbank to work more
on paying back state aid rather than throwing money out,”
Froehlich said. Thorsten Reitmeyer, chief executive officer of
Commerzbank’s Comdirect online unit, responded by thanking
Froehlich for “highlighting our great conditions,” telling the
same conference that the bank’s offers showed how wide profit 
margins were at rivals.  Attempts by Commerzbank and foreign lenders to raise a
greater proportion of their financing needs through German
deposits could damage the country’s banking industry and the
economy as a whole, said Froehlich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
