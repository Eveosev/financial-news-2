Influenza  continued to sweep across
the U.S. last week, with a spike in cases on the West Coast and
early signs that parts of the East Coast may be past the worst
of the epidemic.  About 9.8 percent of all deaths nationwide were due to the
flu and pneumonia for the week ended Jan. 19, more than the 7.3
percent level for an epidemic, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention  said  today. There were eight deaths of children
reported last week, bringing the total to 37 attributed to the
flu since the season began.  The flu season, which has now been at epidemic levels for
three straight weeks, may result in more than 30,000  deaths ,
making it among the worst in the past decade, health officials
have said. The virus began spreading earlier than in past flu
seasons and has been particularly deadly in the elderly.  The outbreak is at high levels in 26 states, with moderate
activity seen in 14 others. Nine states had low levels of
influenza during the week, while activity was minimal in  Maine .  Six of the pediatric deaths reported to the CDC last week
stemmed from influenza B viruses. While two-thirds of influenza
B circulating this year is covered by the  flu vaccine , one-third
of strains arenâ€™t.  To contact the reporters on this story:
