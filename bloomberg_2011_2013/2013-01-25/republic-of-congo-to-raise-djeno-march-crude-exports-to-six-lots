The Republic of Congo is set to
increase exports of Djeno crude in March to six lots, one more
than next month, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Each consignment will be 920,000 barrels. No Nâ€™Kossa grade
cargoes are set to be shipped in March, compared with two in
February, a separate loading program showed.  Loading programs are monthly drafts of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
