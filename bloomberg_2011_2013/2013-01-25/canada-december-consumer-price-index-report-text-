( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/62-001-x/2012012/technote -
notetech2-eng.htm) rose 1.1% in the 12 months to December,
following a 1.2% advance in November.  On a monthly basis, the seasonally adjusted core index
increased 0.1% in December after registering no change in
November.  Annual review of the 2012 Consumer Price Index  In 2012, the annual average increase in consumer prices was
1.5%. This followed a 2.9% rise in 2011 and a 1.8% rise in 2010.
The 2012 increase in the CPI was the lowest since 2009, when
prices increased 0.3%. The average of the annual increases in
the CPI since 1992 is 1.8%.  The slower increase in the CPI in 2012 compared with 2011
was largely attributable to smaller price increases for gasoline
and food. Gasoline prices increased 2.5% in 2012 following gains
of 20.0% in 2011 and 9.1% in 2010. Food prices rose 2.4% on
average in 2012 after increasing 3.7% in 2011.  Note to readers  On March 27, 2013, with the release of the February
 Consumer Price Index  (CPI), the basket of goods and services
used in the calculation of the CPI will be updated. For more

Consumer Price Index’s most volatile components (fruit, fruit
preparations and nuts; vegetables and vegetable preparations;
mortgage interest cost; natural gas;  fuel oil  and other fuels;
gasoline; inter-city transportation; and tobacco products and
smokers’ supplies) as well as the effects of changes in indirect
