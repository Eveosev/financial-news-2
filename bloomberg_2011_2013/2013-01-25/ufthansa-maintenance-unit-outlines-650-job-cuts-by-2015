Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s plane-
maintenance division, the world’s largest, plans to eliminate
about 650 jobs by 2015 as part of a program to generate 1.5
billion euros ($2.02 billion) in savings.  Employees at the Lufthansa Technik unit will be offered
buyout packages and early retirements as part of the workforce
cutback, the Hamburg-based division said today in a statement.
The unit has 13,070 workers at its Gerrman sites, it said.
Positions that are vacated also won’t be filled, Lufthansa said.  Lufthansa,  Europe ’s second-biggest airline, began the
reorganization almost a year ago in an effort to improve
margins. The strategy included eliminating 3,500 administrative
jobs and another 1,000 positions in the catering unit, as well
as bundling European routes that aren’t based at its main
Frankfurt and Munich hubs into the Germanwings low-cost brand.  Lufthansa Technik helps the German carrier and competitors
maintain their aircraft, from routine checks to the most
comprehensive in-depth overhaul known as the D Check.  To contact the reporter on this story:
