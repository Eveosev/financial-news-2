Saeed al-Shihri, a Saudi citizen who
co-founded al-Qaeda’s branch in the Arabian Peninsula, died
after succumbing to wounds he sustained in  Yemen  on Nov. 28, the
nation’s Supreme National Security Committee said.  The committee said al-Shihri was buried in an undisclosed
location in Yemen by al-Qaeda-linked militants, according to a
statement e-mailed late yesterday by the Yemeni Embassy in
Washington.  Al-Shihri commanded all Saudi operatives in the branch
known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and oversaw attacks
on the Yemeni military in the Abyan region, according to the
statement.  Al-Qaeda has used bases in Yemen to strike Western targets
inside the country as well as mount cross-border attacks on
 Saudi Arabia , the world’s largest crude exporter.  While Yemen had announced al-Shihri’s death in a Sept. 10
drone attack in the province of Hadramawt, a subsequent DNA test
proved that the body recovered wasn’t his, the  Associated Press 
reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
