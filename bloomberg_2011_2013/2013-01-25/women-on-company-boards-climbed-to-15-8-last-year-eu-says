More women gained a seat on company
boards in the European Union last year with their share climbing
to 15.8 percent in October, according to European Commission
 figures .  The roll call of female directors increased on management
and supervisory boards in 24 out of 27 EU countries, rising 2.2
percentage points from October 2011, EU regulators said in a
statement today. Ten percent of management board seats and 17
percent of places on supervisory, or non-executive, boards were
held by women.  “Countries with quota legislation remain the motor of
change,” the commission said, citing new rules requiring
companies in  Italy  and  France  to appoint more female board
members.  EU regulators are asking governments and the European
Parliament to approve draft rules that would set a 40 percent
quota to favor women over equally qualified men for supervisory
board seats. The lack of female candidates for a seat on the
European Central Bank’s Executive Board saw European Parliament
lawmakers oppose the appointment of Luxembourg’s Yves Mersch.  To contact the reporter on this story:
