Former Rutgers football coach Greg Schiano paid off the remaining $300,000 of a no-interest home
loan the university gave him in 2007, the school said.  The final payment came on Jan. 22, four days before the
deadline set in his contract, according a university spokesman.  Schiano, 46, who resigned last January to coach the
National Football League’s  Tampa Bay Buccaneers , is searching
for a buyer for the house after lowering the price twice, to
$1.95 million from $2.3 million.  The coach bought land from the university and received an
$800,000 loan from the athletic department to build the house
about two minutes from the school’s High Point Solutions
Stadium. The school forgave $100,000 of the loan each season
Schiano remained as coach, with any balance when he resigned due
one year later. The deadline was tomorrow.  “Former Rutgers head football coach Greg Schiano fulfilled
his final financial obligation to the university Tuesday when he
paid the $300,000 balance remaining on the Logan Lane
property,” university spokesman E.J. Miranda said in an e-mail.  The 8,468-square foot (787 square meters) house with five
bedrooms and six baths is near the university golf course and
has a heated, in-ground pool with waterfall and spa, three-car
garage, camera security system and a media room with a 10-foot
ceiling.  Schiano left the New Brunswick, New Jersey, school after
posting a 68-67 record in 11 seasons. He led the program to its
first postseason bowl victory and a No. 12 final national
ranking in 2006, the highest ever for the team. The Buccaneers
went 7-9 in his first season in the NFL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
