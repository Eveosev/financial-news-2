The euro may experience medium-term
weakness versus the dollar and pound as it approaches key levels
of resistance against the two currencies, according to Bank of
America Corp., citing technical indicators.  The 17-nation currency may fall to its lowest level since
Dec. 10 if it fails to breach a resistance zone from $1.3487 to
$1.3603,  MacNeil Curry , head of foreign-exchange and interest-
rates technical strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote
today in a client note. It might reverse or pause versus
sterling at the 85.33 to 85.93 pence-per-euro level, he said.  “When you get up to those levels, based on the head-and-
shoulders pattern developing in euro-sterling and euro-dollar,
it usually says that we need to start looking for signs of a
top, then a turn to the downside,” Curry said in a telephone
interview.  A head-and-shoulders pattern comprises three consecutive
peaks on a chart, with the middle being the highest. A breach of
a neckline, drawn across the base of the three peaks, is seen to
indicate that a trend is about to reverse.  The shared currency gained 0.6 percent today in  New York  to
$1.3463 and reached $1.3479, its highest level since Feb. 29,
2012. The euro appreciated 0.6 percent to 85.22 pence and rose
to as much as 85.37, the strongest since December 2011.  The euro may pause as it reaches the area of 122.99 to
123.35 yen as the Fibonacci retracement of an October 2008 high
and a “pretty sizable” trend-line pivot meet, Curry said.  ‘Sticking Point’  “You have two pretty big levels coinciding here that could
be a bit of a sticking point,” Curry said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index. Resistance refers to an
area on a chart where sell orders may be clustered, and support
is an area where there may be buy orders.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
