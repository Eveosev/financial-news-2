Fresenius Medical Care AG, the
worldâ€™s biggest provider of  kidney dialysis , said it has
expanded production of bloodlines by a third at its Serbian
plant.  The addition will increase output to 12 million sets a year
at the factory in Vrsac, northeastern  Serbia , the company said
in an e-mailed statement. The plant also produces concentrates
for dialysis kits.  Fresenius, which operates five dialysis clinics in Serbia,
plans to add a second factory in Vrsac in 2014 to double
production of bloodlines to 24 million units, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
