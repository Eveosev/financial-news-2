Steel reinforcement-bar futures were
set for a second weekly gain after a report showed China’s
manufacturing is expanding at the fastest rate in two years,
boosting demand from the world’s biggest consumer.  Rebar for delivery in May rose as much as 0.8 percent to
4,063  yuan  ($653) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
and was at 4,056 yuan at 10:35 a.m. local time. The alloy
climbed to 4,067 yuan yesterday, the highest since July 9, and
has advanced 1.4 percent this week.  The preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was
51.9 in January, according to a statement from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics yesterday. That compares with the 51.5
final reading for December and the 51.7 median estimate of 17
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “The HSBC PMI’s big rebound suggests the present economic
recovery is strong, and that is giving the rebar market a
boost,” Fang Guodong, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co., said by
phone from Zhengzhou.  The average spot  price  for rebar was unchanged at 3,729
yuan a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port rose
0.6 percent to $148.60 a dry ton yesterday, according to The
Steel Index Ltd.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
