A 31-year-old man was charged in
Britain today with attempting to finance terrorism in  Syria  by
arranging travel for would-be attackers and providing cash for
night-vision goggles, rifle mounts and other supplies.  Najul Islam traveled overland from the U.K. to  Turkey  to
deliver the goods to his brother Shajul and provide cash for his
travel to Syria to carry out unspecified acts of terrorism, the
 Metropolitan Police Service  said today in a statement. He will
remain in custody until a scheduled court appearance on Jan. 28.  Islam, who carried out the alleged actions between January
2011 and January 2012, is also accused of financing the travel
arrangements for another man, Jubayer Chowdhury, to leave Syria
and fly to  Bangladesh  as part of the plan, police said.  The police said two other men have already been charged in
the investigation and didnâ€™t identify them.  To contact the reporter on this story:
