Orders from  China , India,  Indonesia 
and  Brazil  and limited new supply will sustain demand for
copper, driving prices up by as much as 5 percent in 2013, said
 OZ Minerals Ltd. (OZL) , Australia’s third-biggest copper producer.  Copper may average $3.70 a pound to $3.80 a pound in 2013,
driven by “urbanization and urban renewal programs in major
developing economies and shortfalls in mine production with
slower development of new projects,” Terry Burgess, chief
executive officer of the Melbourne-based company, said yesterday
in an e-mailed interview.  Copper demand in China, the world’s biggest consumer of the
metal, is forecast to rise 8.4 percent this year and 5 percent
in 2014, according to estimates by Morgan Stanley yesterday.
Global demand will exceed supply by 17,000 metric tons in 2013,
said the bank. OZ Minerals lowered its annual output target
yesterday to a range of 90,000 tons to 95,000 tons and estimated
costs will rise at least 25 percent as it begins underground
mining to sustain production.  OZ Minerals supports Wood Mackenzie Ltd.’s findings that an
additional 6.4 million tons of mined copper will be required by
2022, suggesting a 30 percent increase in demand in the next
decade, Burgess said.  Copper averaged $3.61 a pound last year and was trading at
$3.68 a pound on Comex in  New York  as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney.  To contact the reporter on this story:
