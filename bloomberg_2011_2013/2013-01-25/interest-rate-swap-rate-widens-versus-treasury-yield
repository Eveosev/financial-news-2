Treasuries fell the most since
September after data showed banks plan to repay more of the
 European Central Bank ’s three-year loans than forecast, damping
demand for safer assets.  The ECB said banks will pay back 137.2 billion euros
($184.4 billion) of its three-year loans, known as Longer-Term
Refinancing Operations, next week. That compares with the median
forecast of 84 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. The difference between the yields on the two-year
note and the 30-year bond, the so-called yield curve, was the
widest since May. The U.S. will sell $99 billion in two-, five-
and seven-year notes next week.  “The market is taking the relatively larger-than-expected
paydown of the LTROs as a sign of strength in the banking
sector,” said  Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We are in the
process of backing up the market next week for supply.”  Benchmark 10-year  yields  rose 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 1.95 percent at 5 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The yield rose the most
since Sept. 14 and closed at the highest level since Jan. 4. The
1.625 percent note due November 2022 fell 7/8, or $8.75 per
$1,000 face amount, to 97 1/8.  Treasury  trading volume  rose today to $361 billion, the
most since Jan. 4, according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-
dealer broker of  U.S. government debt . The 2012 daily volume
average is $240 billion.  Futures Bets  Today’s selloff surpassed the eight-basis point rise in
yields posted on Jan. 2, when Congress broke an impasse about
how to avert the so-called fiscal cliff by passing legislation
to avoid income-tax increases for more than 99 percent of
households. The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Jan. 23
to temporarily suspend the nation’s borrowing limit.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long position in 10-year note futures in the week
ending Jan. 22, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative  long positions , or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 66,723 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the most since Jan. 4. Net-long positions rose
144 percent, by 39,425 contracts from a week earlier, the
biggest weekly jump since November, the Washington-based
commission said in its Commitments of Traders report.  Position Reversal  Speculators reversed from a net-short position to a net-
long position in  five-year note futures  in the week ending Jan.
22, after being net short since Dec. 4, according to CFTC data.
Bets prices will rise outnumbered short positions by 42,538
contracts. Last week, traders were net-short 11,789 contracts.  Treasuries returned 2.2 percent in 2012, versus a loss of
0.36 percent this year, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data as of yesterday.  Benchmark yields rose today as 278 banks took advantage of
the first opportunity for early repayment to the ECB. The
Frankfurt-based central bank flooded financial markets with two
tranches of three-year loans a year ago to avert a credit crunch
after banks stopped lending because of  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis.  The U.S. added 155,000 jobs in January, a report from the
Labor Department on Feb. 1 is forecast to show. The pace of jobs
growth averaged 153,000 in 2012, according to Bloomberg data.  Fed Buying  The  Federal Open Market Committee  will meet for two days
ending Jan. 30, the first meeting after the central bank started
its latest purchase program.  The Fed purchased $3.708 billion of Treasuries maturing
from October 2018 to December 2019 today as part of its strategy
to buy $85 billion of government and mortgage debt each month to
put downward pressure on borrowing costs.  “It looks like we could retest 1.97 percent on the 10-
year, but every time there’s a big dip there are good buyers, so
I’d be wary of selling down here,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of
 interest rates  at primary dealer Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New
York. “The Fed is still buying -- that keeps us from rising to
new highs.”  The 10-year yield touched  1.97 percent  on Jan. 4 for the
first time since April 26.  The U.S. will sell $35 billion in two-year notes, an equal
amount in five-year notes and $29 billion in seven-year notes on
three consecutive days starting Jan. 28.  The  yield difference  between the 30-year and the two-year
widened to 2.86 percentage points. The gap has averaged 2.23
percentage points over the past 10 years, according to Bloomberg
data.  A yield curve plots the rates of bonds of the same quality
and different maturities. It steepens when yields on shorter-
maturity notes fall, those on longer-dated bonds rise, or both
happen simultaneously.  To contact the reporter on this story:
