Zurich Insurance Group AG and  Swiss
Re Ltd. (SREN) , Switzerland’s largest insurer and reinsurer, expect
capital markets to improve as investor confidence grows and
concerns about  Europe ’s debt crisis eases.  “Markets are really giving the sign that progress has been
made,” Martin Senn, chief executive officer of Zurich
Insurance, said in an interview in Davos yesterday after meeting
with bankers and policy makers, including Italian Prime Minister
Mario Monti and Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney.  International investors are the most bullish on stocks in
at least 3 1/2 years, with close to two-thirds planning to raise
their holdings of equities during the next six months, according
to a Bloomberg survey that was published on Jan. 22.  “We appear to have in Europe an environment that gives a
certain confidence that the worst of the crisis is over,”
Michel Lies, CEO of Swiss Re said in an interview with CNBC.
“Any kind of stability in the financial markets is good for
us.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  CEO Lloyd Blankfein said today the
worst of the financial crisis may have passed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
