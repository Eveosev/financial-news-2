Anschutz Entertainment Group Inc.,
the world’s largest owner of sports teams, agreed to sell land
near  London ’s O2 Arena to a group of investors that plan a $450
million hotel and residential project.  A joint venture between Queensgate Investments Fund I and
undisclosed partners will develop a 452-room luxury hotel, a
conference center and 100 homes on the 7.4 acre (3-hectare)
site, according to a statement by Luxemburg-based Queensgate.
AEG, part owner of the National Basketball Association’s Los
Angeles Lakers, has retained an undisclosed interest in the
development project.  The O2 Arena is the most-visited music venue in the world
with 8 million people a year attending concerts there, according
to the statement. Construction on the new project is due to
start before April and finish in 2015. The hotel, beside the
River Thames on the Greenwich Peninsula, will be operated by
Arora Hotels Ltd.  “The transaction underlines our strategy to pursue
opportunities with downside protection, partnerships with
premier operating partners, and transactions with multiple value
creation angles,” Jason Kow, Queensgate Investments LLP’s chief
executive officer, said in the statement. Queensgate Investments
advised the fund.  The homes will be sold through broker  Jones Lang LaSalle
Inc. (JLL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
