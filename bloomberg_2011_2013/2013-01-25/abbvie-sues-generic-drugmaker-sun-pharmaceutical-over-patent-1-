AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) , the drug unit that
split from parent  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  on Jan. 1, sued Indian
generic drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. for
infringing a patent for Zemplar, used to treat kidney patients.  AbbVie, based in North Chicago, Illinois, contends Mumbai-
based Sun intends to market a low-cost version of the drug
before the U.S. patent expires in 2016, according to papers
filed yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “Plaintiffs will be substantially and irreparably damaged
and harmed” if the infringement isn’t stopped by a judge,
AbbVie said in its complaint.  Abbott spun off AbbVie to let investors choose between a
medical products company that makes devices, diagnostics and
nutrition products, and AbbVie, a drugmaker based largely around
Humira, a best-selling rheumatoid arthritis injection that
generated $7.93 billion in 2011.  Uday Baldota, a Sun spokesman, didn’t immediately respond
to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is AbbVie v. Sun, 13-cv-00138, U.S. District
Court, District of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To see the patent, click: 5,597,815.  To contact the reporter on this story:
