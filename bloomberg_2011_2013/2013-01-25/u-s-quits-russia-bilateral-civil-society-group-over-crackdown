 The U.S. is quitting a working
group on civil society with  Russia  after the Kremlin increased
limitations for non-government organizationsâ€™ activities.  The working group is no longer an appropriate or effective
forum for promoting the expansion and strengthening of civil
society because the Russian government has taken actions aimed
against civil society, said Thomas O. Melia, a U.S. deputy
assistant secretary of state who follows human-rights issues in
Europe, Russia and the Middle East, according to the Interfax
news service. The U.S. embassy in Moscow confirmed the report.  The working group was created in 2009 as part of a policy
of reset declared by then-President  Dmitry Medvedev  and
President Barack Obama. It was part of a commission designed by
the two leaders to improve relations after they reached a post-
Cold War low under President George W. Bush.  Relations have worsened since  Vladimir Putin  returned to
the presidency last year, with disputes over issues such as
democratic rights, missile defense, weapons proliferation and
the conflict in Syria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
