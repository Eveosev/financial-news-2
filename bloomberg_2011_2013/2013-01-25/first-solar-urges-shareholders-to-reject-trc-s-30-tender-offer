First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the biggest maker
of thin-film solar products, is urging shareholders to reject an
offer by TRC Capital Corp. to buy 2 million shares for $30 each.  First Solar shares traded above the offering price the day
before the mini-tender was made, which would result in TRC
gaining about 2.3 percent of the shares outstanding, the Tempe,
Arizona-based company said today in a statement.  “TRC has made many similar mini-tender offers for shares
of other companies,” First Solar said in the statement. “Mini-
tender offers are designed to seek to acquire less than 5
percent of a company’s outstanding shares, thereby avoiding many
disclosure and procedural requirements of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. As a result, mini-tender offers do not
provide investors with the same level of protections as provided
by larger tender offers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
