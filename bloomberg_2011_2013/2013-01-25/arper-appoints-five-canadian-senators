Prime Minister Stephen Harper said
today he’s appointed five people to Canada’s Senate, increasing
his hold on the upper chamber.  Harper appointed Doug Black, a senior partner with Fraser
Milner Casgrain LLP, to a seat representing Alberta. He also
named David Wells, who has been deputy chief executive officer
of the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum
Board, as well as Lynn Beyak from Ontario, Denise Batters from
Saskatchewan, and Victor Oh, the founding chairman of the
Canada-China Business Communication Council, from Ontario.  With the appointments, which are effective immediately, the
Conservatives have 65 seats in the 105-seat chamber, compared
with 36 Liberals, one Progressive Conservative, and two
independents. There is still one vacant seat.  Harper made the announcements in a statement on his
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
