Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  posted
higher fourth-quarter sales than analysts estimated after
acquiring a natural-gas processing company and increasing
revenue from automation and control products.  Sales of $9.58 billion compared with the $9.5 billion
average from analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit before
pension expense rose to $1.10 a share from $1.05 a year earlier,
the Morris Township, New Jersey-based company said in a
statement. That matched analysts’ projections.  An increase in energy industry investment has fueled sales
at Honeywell’s performance-materials unit, helping make up for
weaker defense orders for aerospace parts and lower European
demand for auto turbochargers.  “This was a typical Honeywell quarter -- solid execution,
no surprises,” Robert Stallard, a London-based analyst at RBC
Capital Markets, wrote in a note today. Stallard has an
outperform rating on the stock.  Sales were buoyed by the $525 million purchase of a 70
percent stake in Thomas Russell Co., which makes equipment to
remove contaminants from natural gas. The acquisition was
completed on Oct. 22.  Including a pension expense to write down the value of
investments to market prices, the company posted  net income  of
$251 million, or 32 cents a share, compared with a loss of $310
million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Honeywell reiterated its
2013 earnings forecast of $4.75 to $4.95 a share.  The company’s stock rose 0.1 percent to $68.33 at the close
in New York. Honeywell has gained 7.7 percent this year,
outperforming the 5.4 percent increase in the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  Segment Profits  Profit from the company’s business units rose 4.7 percent
to $1.5 billion, and the segment margin expanded 50 basis points
to 15.6 percent.  Earnings were driven by the Automation and Control
Solutions unit, which posted a 10 percent gain to $645 million.
Performance Materials saw profit drop 5.8 percent to $210
million because of lower catalyst sales and higher raw-material
costs.  For 2012, Honeywell posted adjusted earnings per share of
$4.48 and sales of $37.7 billion, both in line with its October
forecast. The annual segment profit margin rose 90 basis points
from a year earlier to 15.6 percent, just shy of Honeywell’s
goal of 16 percent to 18 percent in 2014.  For the first quarter, Honeywell expects sales of $9.3
billion to $9.5 billion and earnings per share of $1.10 to
$1.15, according to a presentation on its website. Analysts
project first-quarter earnings of $1.13 a share, the average of
14 estimates.  Transportation unit sales will be hurt in the first quarter
by declining light-vehicle sales in  Europe , and lower defense
spending on aerospace will continue, Honeywell said in the
presentation.  The performance materials unit will post sales gains of as
much as 9 percent on the Thomas Russell acquisition and higher
deliveries from the fuels-processing equipment business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
