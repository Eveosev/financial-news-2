Lithuania’s government and central
bank agreed to seek euro adoption in 2015, pledging action to
ensure inflation falls to the required level.  “We’ve agreed to seek the ambitious goal of joining the
euro zone in 2015,” Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius said
today in the capital, Vilnius, after meeting Finance Minister
Rimantas Sadzius and central bank Governor Vitas Vasiliauskas.  The government will maintain fiscal discipline and state
institutions will avoid raising regulated prices to bring price
growth within the European Union’s limit, Vasiliauskas said.
Inflation is the only euro-adoption criteria that Lithuania
doesn’t already meet, he said.  The 2015 target would probably make Lithuania the last of
the three Baltic nations to introduce the euro. Latvia plans to
join the euro area next year, while Estonia made the switch in
2011. Lithuania missed a previous 2007 goal because inflation
was 0.1 percentage point more than than the level permitted by
the EU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
