American Water Works Co. (AWK) , the
largest publicly traded U.S. water company, said 2012 earnings
would be at the low end of a previously announced range when
results are released tomorrow.  The  stock  fell 3.1 percent to $37.40 at the close in  New
York , the most since Sept. 14, after saying fourth-quarter
results were affected by  Hurricane Sandy  and a decline in the
volume of water sold. The Voorhees, New Jersey-based company
also has accelerated wastewater and water infrastructure
upgrades, according to a statement late yesterday.  American Water Works said it expects 2013 earnings per
share for continuing operations at $2.15 to $2.25, and 2012 EPS
from continuing operations to be at the low end of the $2.12 to
$2.22 range announced in November.  The company also said the California Public Utilities
Commission approved its California unitâ€™s acquisition of the
Garrapata Water System south of the Carmel Highlands in Monterey
County. No terms were given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
