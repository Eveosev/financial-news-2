ResMed Inc. (RMD) , a maker of machines to
regulate breathing for people with sleep disorders, headed for a
record high in Sydney trading after reporting a 24 percent gain
in second-quarter profit.  ResMed shares climbed 5.8 percent to A$4.53 as of 2:12
p.m., poised for their highest close since starting Australian
trade in November 1999. About 9.3 million shares changed hands,
more than twice the daily average in the past three months.  Net income climbed to $77.9 million, or 53 cents a share,
in the quarter ended Dec. 31, while revenue increased 13 percent
to $376.5 million, ResMed said in a statement yesterday. The
earnings-per-share were 6 percent more than projections by
Citigroup Inc. and sales beat the broker’s estimate for 10
percent growth.  “This is another strong result for Resmed, and continues
the momentum” of the past two quarters,  Alex Smith , an analyst
at Citigroup in Sydney, said in a note today. “We continue to
think Resmed is the best value of the major healthcare stocks,”
wrote Smith, who has a buy  rating  on the stock.  Poway, California-based Resmed generates more than half its
sales in the U.S.  ResMed declared a quarterly  dividend  of $0.17 per share to
be paid on March 19. The company said it bought back 1 million
shares at $40 million during the quarter.  Shares of ResMed traded in  New York  climbed 0.8 percent to
$45.47 yesterday, before earnings were reported. The stock rose
to as high as $48.25 in after-hours trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
