Two Greek anarchist groups claimed
responsibility for an explosion on Jan. 20 that injured two
people at a shopping mall in an Athens suburb, saying a
revolution against government policies needs to be triggered.  The groups, called Fierce Freedom and the Instigators of
Social Explosions, said in a statement posted on the Internet
that they support no party, consider themselves enemies of the
state and will always try to avoid casualties.  “Now is the time for critical decisions,” they said in
the statement. “We must destroy the world of power before it
drags us into its rotting state.” The target was chosen because
“shopping centers are symbols of capitalist societies, they are
the temples of consumerism, centers of manipulation and
submission.”  The Sunday morning blast was on the first floor of The Mall
Athens complex, in the northern suburb of Marousi. Few people
were there at the time as stores were closed, according to the
management of the center, the main shareholders of which are
 Lamda Development SA (LAMDA)  and HSBC Property Investments Ltd. The area
was evacuated after an unidentified person made warning calls to
two media groups.  The statement made no reference to other recent attacks on
the headquarters of the  New Democracy  party of Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras and against journalists.  A gunman fired shots at New Democracy’s headquarters on
Jan. 14. That incident followed attacks on the homes of Greek
journalists on Jan. 11 and on the home of the brother of the
government spokesman the following day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
