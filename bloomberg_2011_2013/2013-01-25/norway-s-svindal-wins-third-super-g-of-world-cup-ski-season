Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal won his
third World Cup skiing super-G title in four races to increase
his lead at the top of the season standings.  Svindal, the reigning Olympic super-G champion, finished in
a time of 1 minute, 14.48 seconds for his first career win on
the Streifalm course in Kitzbuehel,  Austria . Austria’s Matthias
Mayer was 0.13 seconds back in second place, with Italy’s
Christof Innerhof a further 0.27 seconds behind in third.  The victory gives Svindal 380 points in the super-G
 standings , 181 more than Italy’s Matteo Marsaglia, who didn’t
finish his run today. Svindal won in Canada and Italy earlier
this season and finished second in the U.S.  Svindal also pulled to within 88 points of Austrian Marcel
Hirscher in the overall World Cup standings. Hirscher, who tops
the table with 935 points, didn’t race today.  The men continue in Kitzbuehel tomorrow with a downhill,
while the women race a giant slalom in Maribor, Slovenia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
