Cotlook Ltd. cut its forecast for a
global cotton surplus by 2.4 percent as consumption gains in
 South Asia  and Turkey.  In the 12 months that started Aug. 1, supplies will outpace
demand by 3.53 million metric tons, Birkenhead, U.K.-based
Cotlook, the publisher of a benchmark cotton index, said today
in a statement. That compared with a forecast last month of 3.62
million and 5.66 million in the year ended July 31.  The research company boosted its estimate for global
consumption by 1.2 percent to 22.5 million tons from last month.
Demand in the  Indian subcontinent  was forecast to climb 1.9
percent to 7.93 million tons.  Last month, Cotlook cut its forecast for the global surplus
by 1.8 percent as output dropped in the U.S., the worldâ€™s
biggest exporter. Yesterday, cotton futures in  New York  reached
an eight-month high, partly on speculation that demand will
increase in  China , the top consumer.  Cotlook increased its projection for global production by
0.7 percent to 26 million tons from a month earlier. Output in
China, the biggest grower, was estimated at 7.21 million tons,
up 3.9 percent.  Today, cotton for March delivery fell 2.9 percent to settle
at 80.52 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Cotlook , which has published cotton news for 85 years,
