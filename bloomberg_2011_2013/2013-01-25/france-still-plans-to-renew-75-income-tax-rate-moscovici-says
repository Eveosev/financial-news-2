France is planning a proposal for a
75 percent income- tax rate  on the wealthiest after a court stuck
down the previous one, Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said.  “People have to realize that those who earn a lot of
money, when the situation is exceptional, they can make an
exceptional effort,” Moscovici said in an interview today at
the World Economic Forum in Davos. “It’s not for their whole
life, but for two years.”  The marginal tax rate on annual earnings of more than 1
million euros ($1.4 million), one of President  Francois Hollande ’s campaign promises, had become a focal point of
discontent and prompted some tax exiles.  France’s top court declared the original plan
unconstitutional because it failed to guarantee taxpayer
equality. Europe 1 radio reported earlier this week that the
government was preparing to drop the tax completely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
