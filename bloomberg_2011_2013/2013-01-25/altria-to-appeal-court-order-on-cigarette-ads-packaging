U.S. tobacco companies including
 Altria Group Inc. (MO) ’s Philip Morris USA said they will appeal a
judge’s ruling ordering them to publish warnings with their
products, in advertisements and on their websites saying they
lied to the public about the health hazards of smoking.  The cigarette makers, in a filing today in Washington, said
they will ask a federal appeals court to overturn U.S. District
Judge Gladys Kessler’s order on the text of the so-called
corrective statements proposed by the Justice Department.
According her ruling, one states: “Tobacco companies
intentionally designed cigarettes to make them more addictive.”
Another says: “All cigarettes cause cancer, lung disease, heart
attacks, and premature death.”  The statements stem from the government’s 1999 case against
the tobacco industry. In 2006, Kessler found the defendants,
also including  Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) ’s R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
and  Lorillard Inc. (LO) ’s Lorillard Tobacco, violated anti-
racketeering law by conspiring to hide cigarettes’ risks.  Kessler previously ordered the companies to stop marketing
cigarettes as “light” and “low-tar” and to make statements
about the health effects of smoking in newspapers and magazines
and on materials attached to cigarette packages.  Charles Miller , a Justice Department spokesman, declined to
immediately comment on today’s filing.  The case is U.S. v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 99-cv-02496,
U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
