Hungarian retail sales fell the most
since 2010 in November of last year amid the countryâ€™s second
recession in four years.  Retail sales dropped 4.1 percent from November 2011, the
biggest plunge since June 2010, after a 3.7 percent decrease in
October, the Budapest-based statistics office said in a
statement today. That compared with a median estimate for a 3.2
percent drop, according to eight economists in a Bloomberg
survey.  The sales volume for furniture and electronic goods dropped
16 percent in November from a year ago while that of books and
computer equipment fell 9 percent, the statistics office said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
