European Union carbon permits had
their biggest weekly drop since June 2011 as the bloc’s
lawmakers failed to agree whether to support an EU commission
plan to temporarily withhold supply through 2015 to fix a glut.  Carbon permits for December dropped 5.1 percent to close at
a record 4.11 euros ($5.53) a metric ton, taking the weekly loss
to 20 percent, according to data from the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London . Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December fell 5.6 percent to 34 euro cents a ton as of 4:59 p.m.  “There is a lot of behind-the-scenes activity at the
European Commission and the  member states  level to try to find a
solution” to the surplus, Paolo Coghe, an analyst at Societe
Generale SA in Paris, said today in an e-mailed note.  The proposal by the commission to alleviate the glut by
delaying sales of some permits caused a rift among governments,
industry organizations and lawmakers. The commission’s plan is
“absurd” and will hurt German industry by pushing up their
costs, Joachim Pfeiffer, Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s CDU party
economy spokesman, said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
