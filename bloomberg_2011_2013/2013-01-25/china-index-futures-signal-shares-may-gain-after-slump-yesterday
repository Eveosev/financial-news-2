Chinese  stocks  fell to a one-week
low, led by consumer-staple and financial shares, amid mounting
concerns over equity valuations approaching the highest levels
in eight months.  Poly Real Estate Group Co. declined among financial stocks,
the biggest  drag  on the CSI 300 Index after valuations climbed
to a 10-month high. Liquor maker  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519)  sank 2.9
percent after forecasting profit that missed some analyst
estimates.  Goertek Inc. (002241) , an Apple Inc. supplier, dropped to a
five-week low after the U.S. company’s shares slumped on
earnings.  Yunnan Baiyao Group Co. (000538) , which makes traditional
Chinese medicine, led health-care stocks higher.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  sank 0.5 percent to 2,291.30,
its lowest close since Jan. 17. The measure lost 1.1 percent
this week. The gauge has risen 17 percent since approaching a
four-year low on Dec. 3 amid signs of an economic recovery and
as the government pledged to encourage urban development. It’s
valued at 12.6 times reported profit, 1.8 percent below the
highest level since May 8,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Medium-term prospects are still a blur,” Xu Shengjun, an
analyst at Jianghai Securities Co. in Shanghai, said by phone
today. “Any reform initiatives are not realized yet. Until we
see concrete steps for reforms, it’s hard for the index to break
2,350.”  The CSI 300 lost 0.4 percent to 2,571.67, paring its climb
since Dec. 3 to 22 percent. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises
Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong retreated 0.8
percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the
most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell 0.7 percent in
New York yesterday.  Financial Stocks  Shanghai Composite trading volumes were 25 percent lower
than the 30-day average today. Its 30-day  volatility  was at
20.6, compared with the 11-month high of 21.6 on Jan. 17. The
index fell 0.8 percent yesterday, the most since Jan. 17, as
North Korea threatened a nuclear test targeted at the U.S. The
White House said the threat was “needlessly provocative” and
will lead to further isolation and sanctions.  A measure of the CSI 300’s banking, brokerage and property
stocks slid 1.2 percent, the second-largest decline among 10
 industry groups . The gauge was valued at 9.4 times reported
profit yesterday, the highest level since March, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Citic Securities Co., the nation’s biggest listed
brokerage, retreated 2.3 percent to 13.54  yuan . Poly Real
Estate,  China ’s second-largest developer by market value, slid
3.6 percent to 13 yuan.  China Vanke Co. (000002) , the biggest, lost 2.1
percent to 11.70 yuan.  Moutai Earnings  China’s new leaders may introduce fresh curbs on the
property market when they take power in March, David Cui, an
equity strategist at Bank of America Corp., said at a media
briefing in Hong Kong today. Chinese stocks may “hold up fairly
well” in the next few months, with the Shanghai Composite
trading in a range of 1,800 and 2,200, he said.  Kweichow Moutai, China’s biggest producer of baijiu liquor
by market value, slid 3.5 percent to 189.05 even after it said
yesterday profit may have risen about 50 percent in 2012 from a
year earlier. Shenyin & Wanguo Securities Co. had forecast a 52
percent increase in earnings-per-share, while the market
consensus was for growth of 63 percent, Tong Xun, an analyst at
the brokerage, wrote in a report today.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858) , the nation’s second-largest baijiu
producer, fell 3 percent to 25.12 yuan. Sichuan Swellfun Co.,
the Chinese liquor maker that’s a partner of Diageo Plc, lost 3
percent to 17.23 yuan.  GoerTek dropped 2.4 percent to 34.02 yuan, capping a 14
percent loss for the week. Apple slid 12 percent yesterday in
New York after reporting the slowest profit growth since 2003
and the weakest sales increase in 14 quarters.  Defensive Stocks  A  health-care  sub-index jumped 2.7 percent today, the
biggest gain among the CSI 300’s industry groups, to the highest
level since Sept. 8, 2011. Yunnan Baiyao gained 2.5 percent to
76.65 yuan. Huadong Medicine Co. added 2.7 percent to 38.32
yuan.  “Investors are buying health-care stocks to seek a safe
haven,” said Li Jun, a strategist at Central China Securities
Co. in  Shanghai . “Pharmaceutical shares are typically defensive
stocks and deliver stable earnings growth.”  Lion Fund Management Co., the $7.5 billion money manager
that led Chinese investors into gold exchange-traded products,
said the best returns in 2013 will come from stocks that tap the
migration of farmers to the city.  Demand for building materials, home appliances and property
will benefit as Li Keqiang, poised to become China’s new premier
in March, promotes urbanization to drive economic growth that’s
showing signs of accelerating after a two-year slowdown, Lion’s
Chief Executive Officer, Ao Chengwen, said in an interview with
Bloomberg News on Jan. 23.  Index Futures  China selected five foreign institutional investors to
trade stock-index futures in the country, according to an
official from the China Financial Futures Exchange.  The exchange approved the five qualified foreign
institutional investors “recently,” said the official, who
didn’t identify them and asked not to be named because the
information isn’t public. The QFIIs may trade the futures only
for hedging purposes, China Business News reported today.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese
 exchange-traded fund  in the U.S., was unchanged at $41.53 in New
York, after declining 0.5 percent Jan. 23. Shanghai-based Focus
Media Holding Ltd., which disclosed an investigation into
possible violations of securities laws Jan. 18, sank the most
since September.  --Zhang Shidong, Weiyi Lim. Editors: Darren Boey, Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
