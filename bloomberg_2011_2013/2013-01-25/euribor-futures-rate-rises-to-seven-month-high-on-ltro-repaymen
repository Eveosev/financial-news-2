Euribor futures traders stepped up
bets that borrowing costs will rise after the  European Central
Bank  said lenders will repay more of its initial three-year
loans than economists forecast.  The implied yield on the euro interbank offered rate
futures contract due December 2013 climbed as much as 17 basis
points to 0.59 percent, the highest since June 29, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate was 0.56 percent at 1:20
p.m. in  London .  The ECB said today 278 firms will hand back 137.2 billion
euros ($184.4 billion) of emergency loans at the first
opportunity on Jan. 30, compared with the median forecast of 84
billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The
Frankfurt-based central bank’s first round of loans totaled 489
billion euros and borrowers can continue to make early
repayments in coming weeks.  “This is more than we had expected and underlines the
material improvement in funding conditions for most European
banks in the past twelve months,” Michael Symonds, a credit
analyst at Daiwa Capital Markets in London, wrote in a note to
clients.  The ECB flooded financial markets with two portions of so-
called Longer Term Refinancing Operations totaling more than 1
trillion euros a year ago in an effort to spur lending between
banks. The prospect of banks repaying early and draining money
from the financial system has driven up  interest rates  in the
 futures markets .  To contact the reporter on this story:
