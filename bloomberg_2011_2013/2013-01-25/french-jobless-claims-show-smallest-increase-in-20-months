French jobless claims rose at the
slowest pace in 20 months, the first sign the nation’s labor
market may be stabilizing.  The number of people actively looking for work rose by 300
in December to 3.133 million, the Labor Ministry said today in
an e-mailed statement from Paris. Economists predicted an
increase of 25,000, according to the median of five forecasts
gathered by Bloomberg News.  With the number of claimants at the highest since 1998,
President Francois Hollande has said reducing unemployment is
among his top priorities. His government has leaned on large
companies to avoid lay-offs, has cut social charges and brokered
an agreement with unions on loosening labor rules in a push to
improve competitiveness.  “My objective is to make sure that unemployment, which has
continuously increased for two years, starts to decline,”
Hollande said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
