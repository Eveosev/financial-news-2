Chile ’s peso declined as concern
mounted that the central bank may intervene to stem gains in the
region’s best-performing currency this month.  The peso depreciated 0.3 percent to 471.84 per U.S. dollar
at the close in Santiago and was down less than 0.1 percent for
the week. The currency earlier today touched 469.45, the
strongest level in two weeks. It has rallied 1.6 percent in
January, the most among six major Latin American currencies.  Concern that Chile may try to weaken the peso had prevented
it from breaking through 470 per dollar since Jan. 8. It reached
a three-month high of 469.10 that day before closing weaker as
Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said the government was
concerned about the exchange rate’s effect on exporters.  “No one wants to sell dollars below 470,” said Alejandro Araya, a trader at Banco Santander Chile in Santiago. The risk
of intervention is “not worth it for the extra five pesos.”  Chile’s central bank last intervened in January 2011 after
the peso reached 465.13 per U.S. dollar. The monetary authority
bought $12 billion in $50 million daily purchases.  The  real exchange rate,  a measure of Chile’s currency
versus trading partners on an inflation-adjusted basis, reached
87.53 in October, the strongest since December 2010. It weakened
to 88.2 last month, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
