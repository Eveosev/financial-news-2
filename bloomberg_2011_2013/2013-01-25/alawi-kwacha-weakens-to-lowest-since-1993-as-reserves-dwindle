Malawi’s kwacha, the worst-
performing currency this year, dropped to its lowest in almost a
decade as the Southern African country’s reserves continue to
dwindle.  The kwacha retreated 3.6 percent to 360 a dollar at 5:20
p.m. in Lilongwe, the capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It has fallen 7 percent this year and is at the
weakest since June 22, 1993, when Bloomberg began compiling data
on the currency.  Malawi’s foreign-currency reserves fell 4.8 percent to $180
million in the week through Jan. 18, according to the  Reserve
Bank  of Malawi, with reserves able to cover less than one month
of imports.  President Joyce Banda devalued the kwacha by a third
against the dollar a month after taking office in April to meet
conditions set by the  International Monetary Fund  for a
resumption of donor aid. Malawians began nationwide protests
last week as inflation soared to 34.6 percent in December.  “The pressure on dollar-kwacha is likely to remain as the
external sector is still very poor,” Yvette Babb, a strategist
at Standard Bank Group Ltd. in Johannesburg, said in an e-mailed
reply to questions today. “Foreign-exchange reserves continue
to be eroded.”  Phone calls to Reserve Bank Governor Charles Chuka and
Ralph Tseka, a spokesman, weren’t answered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
