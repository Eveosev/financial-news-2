SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD) , an oil and
natural gas producer, said it found no wrongdoing in its review
of business transactions with companies controlled by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer  Tom Ward  and his family.  “The board has found no evidence of impropriety or ‘front
running,’” in which the companies buy leasehold interests and
then sell them to SandRidge, according to a statement from the
Oklahoma City-based company today. The board will consider
requests “for the appointment of independent counsel and other
investigative measures concerning the activities surrounding
their allegations.”   TPG-Axon Capital Management LP and Mount Kellett Capital
Management LP, owners of a combined 11 percent stake, have urged
SandRidge to replace Ward, cut overhead and refocus on drilling
for oil. TPG began soliciting votes Jan. 16 to replace the
seven-member board.  TPG, based in  New York , said in a Jan. 23  website 
presentation that SandRidge should disclose more about its
dealings with Ward’s family, including whether they used company
information for personal gain.  SandRidge has paid $3.9 million to TLW Land & Cattle LP, a
Ward business, and $5.6 million to WCT Resources LLC, run by
Ward’s son Trent, for royalties and leases, according to the
presentation. TPG reviewed records and found 15 instances where
WCT and SandRidge bought adjacent oil and natural gas leases in
Kansas’ Mississippian Lime field at about the same time.  Board Directors  The purchases from WCT are less than one-fourth of 1
percent of SandRidge’s acreage and the board reviewed them in
advance, according to today’s statement. Given the size of
SandRidge’s leasehold across 30 counties in Oklahoma and  Kansas ,
it’s “entirely unremarkable” that WCT has land nearby,
according to the board statement.  Apart from Ward, SandRidge’s directors are all independent,
according to the company’s 2012 proxy statement. SandRidge has
business ties to two of them, according to filings. SandRidge
rents office space from Roy Oliver for $510,000 a year. Everett Dobson owns a 3.9 percent stake in the Oklahoma City Thunder, a
basketball team in which Ward owns 19.2 percent. SandRidge has
sponsorship deals with the team.  SandRidge investors would see a better return on their
investment if the company were sold or run by new managers, TPG
and Mount Kellett have said. The shares have fallen 16 percent
in the past 12 months.  SandRidge has said replacing the board may trigger change-
in-control provisions linked to its debt. The company said last
week that TPG “has repeatedly made inflammatory and false
statements” with the goal of taking control of the company and
restructuring or selling it.  Anton Nicholas and Scott Tagliarino, spokesmen for TPG-Axon
and Mount Kellet, respectively, wouldn’t immediately comment
when reached by phone and e-mail.  The shares roses 0.3 percent to $7.07 at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
