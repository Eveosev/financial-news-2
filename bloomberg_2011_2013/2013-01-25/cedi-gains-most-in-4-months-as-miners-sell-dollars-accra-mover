Ghana ’s cedi gained the most in more
than four months as mining companies and the central bank sold
dollars.  The currency of Africa second-biggest gold producer
appreciated 1.1 percent to 1.8915 a dollar, the biggest increase
since Sept. 21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
traded 0.7 percent higher by 4:51 p.m. in Accra, the capital.  “Mining companies that needed some cedis to finance their
activities in the country offered dollars on the market today,”
Sadiq Abubakar, a currency trader at International Commercial
Bank Ltd. in Accra, said by phone. “The central bank too sold
some dollars to banks.”  Adams Nyinaku, head of treasury at the Bank of Ghana,
wasn’t available to comment, according to a woman who answered
the phone at his office and declined to be identified.  Companies including  Greenwood Village , Colorado based
Newmont Mining Corp. and Johannesburg-based  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  and
 AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (AU)  operate mines in the West African nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
