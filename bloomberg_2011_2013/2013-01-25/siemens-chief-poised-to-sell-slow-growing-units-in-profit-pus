Siemens AG (SIE) , whose earnings dipped in
the first quarter, needs to sell slow-growing businesses that
are not part of its “inner core” in order to boost profits,
Chief Executive Officer Peter Loescher said.  “We are looking into businesses with slower growth and
less synergies with the core part of our portfolio,” Loescher
said in a Bloomberg TV interview in Davos. “Portfolio decisions
will continue to be an important part of our company.”  Europe’s largest engineering company is already planning to
offload units such as airport luggage systems, mail automation
and water technology after shareholders approved the spinoff of
the underperforming Osram lighting unit this week. Siemens is
targeting profit which represents 12 percent of revenue as its
profitability has trailed that at competitors  General Electric
Co. (GE)  and  ABB Ltd. (ABBN)  for six consecutive quarters.  The Munich-based company this week said net income from
continuing operations slipped 1.4 percent to 1.3 billion euros
($1.7 billion) in the three months through December.  To strenghten certain businesses, Siemens is also targeting
acquisitions, Loescher said today.  The 680 million-euro purchase of Belgian software maker LMS
International, announced in in November, is a prime example of
how to bolster Siemens’ industrial information technology
business, he said.  “What we are doing is really focussing on strengthening
the inner core of the company,” Loescher said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
