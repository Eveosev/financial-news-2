Carnival Corp. (CCL) ’s Costa Crociere unit
is under probe for “possible violations” of the Italian
administrative responsibility law in the Costa Concordia
shipwreck probe, the company said in a statement.  Costa is “confident it will be able to demonstrate its
full compliance with the law and states its full trust” in
magistrates, it said yesterday.  The Costa Concordia ran aground near the island of Giglio
hours after leaving a port close to  Rome  with 4,200 passengers
and crew on Jan. 13, 2012, leaving 32 people dead. Captain
Francesco Schettino is under investigation for allegedly causing
the shipwreck and may face charges of manslaughter and
abandoning the ship before the evacuation was completed. He
denies any wrongdoing.  Prosecutors in Grosseto,  Italy  on Feb. 22 widened their
probe to include seven employees of Costa Crociere, which has
said it’s “absolutely certain” its staff acted correctly.  Italian consumer group Codacons said on its  website  that
Costa Crociere risks a “super-fine” over the incident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
