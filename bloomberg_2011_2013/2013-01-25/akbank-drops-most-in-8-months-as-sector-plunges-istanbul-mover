Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  fell to the lowest level
in eight months as Turkish stocks retreated from a record high
after  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  said a rally in Turkish banks is
coming to an end.  Akbank, which has a 10 percent weighting in the Istanbul
Stock Exchange National 100 Index,  slid  3.2 percent to 9.92
liras by 2:54 p.m., falling the most since May 25. The  index 
retreated 1.1 percent to 85,473.66, snapping a 10-day rally and
paring its 10th weekly gain to 0.4 percent. The Turkish banking
 gauge  slipped 2.5 percent, the steepest decline since July 5.  Turkish banks are “more vulnerable to potential risk
factors that the market has been neglecting so far,” Ates Buldur, an analyst at the Istanbul unit of Credit Suisse, said
in an e-mailed report today. Turkish banks are expected to see
profit margins narrow due to rising competition and lower
interest rates, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report
yesterday.  “The positive mood over Turkish banks has been distorted a
bit,” Bulent Sengonul, an analyst at Istanbul-based Is
Investment, said in a phone interview today. “It could also
have been some other bank that led today’s declines - there’s an
overall selling in banks.”  The banks are becoming more vulnerable to “funding market
volatility,” Moody’s said in its report.  Buldur maintained his neutral rating for Akbank, saying the
lender was “fairly valued.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
