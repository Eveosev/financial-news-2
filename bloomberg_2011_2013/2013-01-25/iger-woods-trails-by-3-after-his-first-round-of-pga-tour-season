Tiger Woods trails leaders K.J Choi
and defending champion Brandt Snedeker by three shots following
his first competitive round of the U.S. PGA Tour golf season.  Woods was in a position to be closer to the leaders, who
are 7 under par, before dropping a shot at two of his final
three holes in the Farmers Insurance Open yesterday. Woods, who
has won the event six times, had a 4-under-par 68.  Woods said he’d play the event the same day Qatar Golf
Association President Hassan al Nuaimi told reporters the 14-
time major champion was “not worth” a $3 million appearance
fee to take part in the European Tour’s Qatar Masters, which
also began yesterday.  The Farmers tournament is played over the North and South
courses at  Torrey Pines  in  La Jolla ,  California , with the winner
collecting $1.1 million.  Snedeker, an American, didn’t drop a shot on the North
course. Choi, from  South Korea , birdied three of his last four
holes on the South course for a round of 65.  Eight players are a shot behind the leaders, with a further
nine at 5-under 67.  Woods won the event four straight years through 2008 and
was also champion in 1999 and 2003.  Phil Mickelson , the champion in 1993, 2000 and 2001, is in
a tie for 90th place after an even-par 72 on the North course.  To contact the reporter on this story:
