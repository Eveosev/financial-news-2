Palfinger AG (PAL) , the world’s biggest
maker of truck-mounted knuckle-boom cranes, rose to the highest
level in 17 months in Vienna after UBS told clients to buy the
stock to benefit from better truck sales.  Palfinger, based in Salzburg,  Austria ,  rose  as much as 6.4
percent in the Austrian capital and traded up 6 percent at 20.80
euros by 12:05 p.m., the highest intraday level since August
2011. The share has gained 27 percent this year, giving it a
market capitalization of 743 million euros ($996 million).  “Palfinger offers a good opportunity for investors to play
the European truck recovery and pre-buy story ahead of new
emission standards next year, without being directly exposed to
truck makers,” Frankfurt-based UBS analyst Sebastian Ubert
wrote in a note to clients, in which he raised his
recommendation on Palfinger to buy from neutral.  Palfinger, which sells its cranes mainly to builders and
freight-transport companies, last year expanded to  China  to tap
into a building boom there. The company predicted a small
revenue increase for 2012, coming from business areas outside of
 Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
