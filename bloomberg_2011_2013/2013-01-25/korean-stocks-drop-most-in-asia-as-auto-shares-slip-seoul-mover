South Korea ’s benchmark stock index
fell the most in 10 weeks as earnings at  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  missed
forecasts and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  said a strengthening
currency may hurt profits this year.  Kia Motors Corp., South Korea’s second-biggest carmaker,
sank 5 percent to the lowest in more than two years after
fourth-quarter profit dropped as a strengthening Korean won
eroded the value of its exports. Samsung Electronics Co., which
reported better-than-estimated profits, lost 2.6 percent after
saying a stronger currency may cut earnings. LG Display Co. led
Apple suppliers lower after the iPhone maker’s shares plunged
the most in more than four years.  The  Kospi index  fell 1.2 percent to 1,940.66 at 1:37 p.m.
in Seoul, the biggest decline among major Asian benchmark
gauges. The measure is heading for its steepest loss since Nov.
13 and has slipped 2.3 percent this week, bound for a third
straight drop. Foreign investors sold a net $659 million of
Korean stocks this year through yesterday, the most among 10
Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.  “Disappointing automaker earnings led some investors to
cut holdings because the solid pace of growth the companies had
been showing in the past few years won’t be the case this
year,” Chung Yun Sik, chief investment officer for equities at
ING Investment Management Korea Ltd., said by phone today.
“While Samsung had another strong quarter, investors are
worried as the company won’t be completely free from margin
contraction in smartphones amid growing competition.”  Second-Cheapest  The won rose 8.3 percent in 2012 and reached a 17-month
high of 1,054.49 per dollar on Jan. 15. The currency weakened
for a third day today.  Gauges of electronic and transport equipment makers
 contributed  to about three-quarters of today’s losses in the
 Kospi index. (KOSPI)  The benchmark measure trades at 9 times estimated
profit, compared with the five-year average of 10.9 times,
making it the cheapest in  Asia  after  Pakistan , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Kia’s fourth-quarter operating income tumbled 51 percent to
404.2 billion won, the company said in a regulatory filing
today. That’s 35 percent below the average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , the nation’s biggest
carmaker, reported profits yesterday that missed forecasts.  Hyundai Motor retreated 3.6 percent.  Hyundai Wia Corp. (011210) ,
which manufactures auto parts, tumbled 6.2 percent. Hyundai
Glovis Co., the logistics unit of Hyundai Motor Group, sank 6.6
percent.  LG Display, which supplies panels to Apple, lost 2.8
percent. SK Hynix Inc., which provides chips, fell for a fourth
day. Apple plunged yesterday after posting the slowest profit
growth since 2003 and the  weakest  sales increase in 14 quarters,
fueling concern that mounting costs and competition may curtail
growth.  Samsung Electronics, which reported fourth-quarter net
income rose by a more-than-estimated 76 percent, is poised for
the lowest close since Nov. 30. The company said the
strengthening won may cut operating profit by at least 3
trillion won this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
