The pound weakened for a second day
versus the euro, falling to a 13-month low, after a report
showed the U.K. economy shrank more than analysts forecast in
the fourth quarter, damping demand for the British currency.  Sterling declined its weakest level in five months versus
the dollar, as the contraction left the U.K. on the brink of an
unprecedented triple-dip recession. The euro also strengthened
after the  European Central Bank  said 137.2 billion euros of
three-year loans granted to banks to avert the sovereign-debt
crisis would be repaid early. Gilts fell for a second day.  “Broad sentiment seems to be that the euro area is doing
better and the risks there have come off, whereas the U.K.
economy remains weak,” said Raghav Subbarao, a foreign-exchange
strategist at Barclays Plc in  London . “The move in euro-
sterling has been far more than we expected, and from a medium-
term perspective it looks a little unjustified.”  The pound depreciated 0.5 percent to 85.18 pence per euro
at 4:19 p.m. London time, after touching 85.37 pence, the
weakest level since Dec. 12, 2011. Sterling was little changed
at $1.5805 after sliding to $1.5746, the least since Aug. 21.  The pound has dropped 2.8 percent this year, the second-
worst performer after the yen out of 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The euro advanced 2.6 percent and the dollar gained 0.3 percent.  ‘Negative View’  Gross domestic product  dropped 0.3 percent from the three
months through September, the  Office for National Statistics 
said in London. That compared with the median of 38 estimates in
a Bloomberg News  survey  for a decline of 0.1 percent.  Growth in the U.K. is struggling to rebound more than three
years after the economy emerged from its deepest recession since
World War II, with snow this month raising the possibility of a
further contraction in the current quarter.  Bank of England 
Governor  Mervyn King  said this week policy makers will provide
more stimulus if needed.  “I have a negative view on sterling and most of the flows
are versus the euro right now,” said  John Hardy , head of
foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in London. “The U.K.
economy doesn’t look particularly strong. Euro-area tail risks
have been unwinding.”  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.06 percent. The rate increased two
basis points yesterday. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in
September 2022 fell 0.415, or 4.15 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 97.32.  Inflation Bonds  U.K. gilts handed investors a loss of 1.4 percent this
month through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German bonds dropped 1.3 percent and Treasuries fell
0.3 percent.  Index-linked gilts outperformed nominal securities after
the Debt Management Office said today that investors and traders
in U.K. government bonds called for an increase in the supply of
inflation-linked securities in the next fiscal year.  The 10-year  break-even rate , the difference in yield
between nominal gilts and inflation-linked bonds, widened three
basis points to 3.12 percentage points, and reached 3.15
percentage points, the highest since June 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
