Wheat fell for a fourth day in
 Chicago  on speculation moisture in the next week will ease
drought conditions for winter crops in the U.S. Great Plains.  Areas of the central and southern plains may see some rain
tomorrow, followed by light precipitation early next week,
forecaster DTN said. All of  Kansas  and  Oklahoma , the top winter
wheat-growing states, were experiencing severe to exceptional
drought as of Jan. 22, the U.S. Drought Monitor showed. At the
end of November, crops were in the worst condition since records
began in 1985, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “The most recent  weather forecasts  have rain falling in
Kansas early next week,” economist  Dennis Gartman  said today in
his daily Gartman Letter. “The winter-wheat crop needs that
moisture badly.”  Wheat for delivery in March slid 0.3 percent to $7.66 a
bushel at 6:59 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade, set for a 3.2
percent weekly drop. In Paris, milling wheat for the same
delivery month declined 0.2 percent to 246.25 euros ($331.38) a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  Soybeans for delivery in March fell 0.2 percent to $14.3275
a bushel in Chicago, after rising as much as 0.5 percent.
Futures were 0.2 percent higher this week and on course for the
first monthly advance since August. Corn for the same delivery
month decreased 0.1 percent to $7.235 a bushel, heading for a
0.5 percent decline this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
