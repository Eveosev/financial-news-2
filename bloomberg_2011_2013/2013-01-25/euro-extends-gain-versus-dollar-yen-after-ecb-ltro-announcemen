The euro rose to its strongest level
against the dollar in 11 months as the European Central Bank
said banks will hand back a greater amount of three-year loans
than analysts estimated, boosting short-term borrowing costs.  The shared currency gained for a seventh week against the
yen as the ECB said 278 banks will repay 137.2 billion euros
($184.4 billion) next week, versus an 84 billion-euro forecast
in a Bloomberg survey. The yen dropped in a record weekly losing
streak versus the dollar as  Japan ’s consumer prices fell. The
two-year interest-rate swap spread between the euro and dollar,
a key lending rate, increased to the widest in six months.  “The two-year swap rate driven by this big repayment has
been correlated with the grind higher in euro,” Dan Dorrow,
head of research in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , at Faros Trading LLC,
said in a telephone interview. “It’s a classic monetary
interest-differential effect.”  The euro gained 0.7 percent to $1.3464 at 5 p.m. in New
York and touched $1.3479, the strongest level since Feb. 29. It
advanced 1.1 percent this week. Against the yen, the euro
appreciated 1.2 percent to 122.32 and reached 122.77, the
highest since April 11, 2011.  The difference between the rate on a two-year interest-rate
swap denominated in euros and that in dollars increased to 24
basis points, the most since July, from 16 basis points
yesterday. The euro rate was 0.42 percent, and the dollar rate
was 0.66 percent.  The yen fell 7.45 percent in the past month, the biggest
decline among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 2.5
percent, and the dollar rose 0.1 percent.  Net Shorts  Futures traders decreased bets for a sixth straight week
that the yen will decline against the U.S. dollar, figures from
the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.  The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the yen compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net  shorts  -- was 64,068 on Jan.
22, compared with net shorts of 65,727 a week earlier.  Traders raised bets the euro will gain against the dollar,
known as net longs, to 21,381, the most since July 2011, from
7,315 the week before, CFTC data show.  A gauge of currency  volatility  rose for a third day.
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G7 Volatility Index, based on three-month
options on Group of Seven nations’ currencies, touched 8.91
percent, after falling to a one-week low of 8.15 percent on Jan.
23. It rose to 9.19 percent on Jan. 18, the highest level since
Aug. 2.  Lower volatility makes investments in currencies with
higher benchmark interest rates more attractive as the risk in
such trades is that market moves will erase profits.  ECB Loans  The ECB flooded financial markets a year ago with two
tranches of Longer-Term Refinancing Operations totaling more
than 1 trillion euros after banks stopped lending to each other
due to the sovereign-debt crisis. Financial institutions have
the option of repaying the loans, which were made at the average
of the ECB’s  benchmark rate  over their duration, after a year.  “The repayment is much higher than the market expected,
and it’s positive for the euro,” said  Roberto Mialich , a senior
currency strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  in Milan. “Banks, which
were part of the euro problem, are willing and able to make
repayment to the ECB and this will provide further upward
momentum.”  Pound Drops  Sterling fell against the euro after a report showed
Britain’s economy shrank 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter. The
pound lost 0.6 percent to 85.19 pence per euro and touched 85.37
pence, the weakest level since December 2011.  The euro may experience medium-term weakness versus the
dollar and pound as it approaches key resistance levels,
according to Bank of America Corp., citing technical analysis.  The shared currency may slide against the greenback if it
fails to breach a zone from $1.3487 to $1.3603,  MacNeil Curry ,
head of foreign-exchange and interest-rates technical strategy
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a client note. It
might reverse or pause versus sterling at the 85.33 to 85.93
pence-per-euro level, he said. Resistance is an area on a chart
where sell orders may be clustered.  The yen fell as the government said consumer prices
excluding fresh food fell 0.2 percent in December from a year
earlier. The central bank announced open-ended asset purchases
and a 2 percent inflation target this week.  The Japanese currency was down 0.6 percent to 90.91 per
dollar after depreciating as much as 1 percent to 91.19, the
weakest level since June 2010. It dropped for an 11th straight
week, the longest losing streak in data compiled by Bloomberg
going back to 1971.  Aussie Dollar  The Australian dollar rose versus the yen for a second day
on speculation Japan’s consumer-price decline will add pressure
on the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to expand stimulus. The currency gained 0.4
percent to 94.76 yen and touched 95.10, the highest since 2008.  The Aussie reached a three-week low versus the U.S. dollar
as traders remained almost split on whether the Reserve Bank of
 Australia  will cut its benchmark interest rate on Feb. 5. The
currency touched $1.0403, falling below its 100-day moving
average of $1.0417. It dropped yesterday below its 50-day moving
average at $1.0473.  South Africa’s rand was the biggest winner among the
greenback’s 16 most-traded peers as investors bet the currency
fell too much, too quickly, yesterday as it reached an almost
four-year low. The rand gained as much as 1.3 percent to 8.9325
per dollar, the biggest intraday jump since November. It fell to
9.0878 yesterday, the weakest level since April 2009.  Credit Suisse Group AG reduced its three-month forecast for
the currency to 9.2 per U.S. dollar from 8.7, citing the risk of
social and political instability from consolidation in the
mining sector. Credit Suisse disclosed the revision in a
research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
