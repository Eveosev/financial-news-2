KBC Groep NV (KBC) , Belgium’s biggest bank
and insurer by market value, will repay 8.3 billion euros ($11.1
billion) of three-year loans to the European Central Bank in the
first quarter.  “Given the substantially improved condition of the
wholesale funding market and KBC’s very solid liquidity
position, we decided to repay” the loans, Chief Financial
Officer Luc Popelier said in a statement today without
specifying when in the quarter the repayments would be made.
Brussels-based KBC has covered a quarter of its 2013 wholesale
funding needs in the first three weeks of the year, it said.  The ECB will say at about noon in Frankfurt how much three-
year LTRO banks plan to pay back at the first opportunity on
Jan. 30. President Mario Draghi flooded financial markets with
two tranches of three-year loans, or LTRO, a year ago to avert a
credit crunch after banks stopped lending to each other because
of the sovereign debt crisis. Banks borrowed at the average of
the ECB’s benchmark rate over the loans’ duration.  KBC drew 3.5 billion euros from the ECB in December 2011 to
help replace funding at its Irish banking unit. It had got
another 5.4 billion euros “to further enhance its funding
maturity structure,” according to today’s statement.  The rest of the loans will stay with a KBC subsidiary for
now, spokeswoman Viviane Huybrecht said by telephone, without
naming the unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
