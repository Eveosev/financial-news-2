German two-year notes extended a
decline after the  European Central Bank  said banks will repay
137.2 billion euros of three-year loans next week at the first
opportunity for early repayment.  The two-year yield climbed five basis points to 0.22
percent at 11:05 a.m. London time. The rate rose to as high as
0.24 percent, the most since April 2.  The yield on 10-year bunds increased four basis points to
1.61 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
