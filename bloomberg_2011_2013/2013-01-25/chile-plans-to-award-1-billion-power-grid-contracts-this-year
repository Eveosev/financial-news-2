Chile plans to grant about $1
billion of electricity-grid contracts this year as high power
prices threaten to curb investments in the world’s biggest
copper-producing country.  About $200 million worth of contracts have been awarded
already and authorities are preparing an $800 million contract
to connect the country’s two main grids, Energy Minister Jorge Bunster said in an interview in Santiago today. About $920
million of contracts were awarded in 2012.  “This agreement will speed up improvements in the grid
that makes investments in power generation viable,” he said.  A bill that regulates transmission investments will permit
more companies, including suppliers of renewable energy, to
connect to the country’s power network. High energy prices pose
the biggest threat to growth in the country, Economy Minister
Pablo Longueira said earlier today.  Lawmakers also agreed on aspects of a bill that regulates
investments in geothermal energy, as well as extending a
deadline that requires 20 percent of power to be sourced from
renewable energy by 2020, until 2025, Bunster said. The target
was lowered to a range of 15 percent to 20 percent. Renewable
energy companies have obtained approval for projects with a
combined capacity of more than 3,000 megawatts, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
