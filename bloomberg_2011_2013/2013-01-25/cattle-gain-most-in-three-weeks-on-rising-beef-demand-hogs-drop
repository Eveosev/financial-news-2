Cattle rose the most in three weeks
on signs of increasing demand for U.S. beef. Hog prices fell.  Meatpackers processed 497,000 cattle in the first four days
of this week, up 2.7 percent from the same period a year
earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Beef-export
sales were 14,188 metric tons (31.28 million pounds) in the week
ended Jan. 17, up 34 percent from the four-week average, USDA
data show.  “These packers are still needing cattle with the demand
improving” on the domestic and export side,  Lane Broadbent , a
vice president at KIS Futures in  Oklahoma City , said in a
telephone interview.  Cattle futures for April delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$1.3115 a pound at 10 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. A
close at that level would be the biggest gain for the most-
active contract since Jan. 3. Through yesterday, prices are down
1.5 percent this month.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement added 0.4
percent to $1.48575 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for April settlement slid 0.5 percent to 89.225
cents a pound in Chicago. Prices are up 4.6 percent this month
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
