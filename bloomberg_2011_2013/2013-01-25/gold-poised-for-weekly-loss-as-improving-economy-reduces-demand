Gold futures dropped to a two-week
low as Germany’s business confidence rose more than forecast,
bolstering the outlook for Europe’s largest economy and eroding
the appeal of the precious metal as a haven.  The Ifo institute’s business climate index in January
climbed to 104.2, the highest since June. In the U.S., claims
for jobless benefits last week fell to a five-year low, the
Labor Department said yesterday. Gold has declined 1.1 percent
this month, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of  equities 
has climbed 4.5 percent.  “The economic conditions are looking up, so people are
rethinking about their investments in gold,” Frank Lesh, a
trader at FuturePath Trading in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “Equities seem more remunerative than gold at the
moment.”  Gold futures for February delivery fell 0.8 percent to
settle at $1,656.60 an ounce at 1:54 p.m. on the Comex in New
York, the third straight decline. Earlier, the price touched
$1,655, the lowest since Jan. 11. This week, the metal dropped
1.8 percent.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 1.6 percent to
$31.206 an ounce on the Comex. This week, the price dropped 2.3
percent.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery rose 0.7 percent to $1,694.90 an ounce. This
week, the price climbed 1.2 percent, the fourth straight gain
and the longest rally in almost a year.  Palladium futures for March delivery rose 2 percent to $741
an ounce on the Nymex. This week, the price gained 2.5 percent
the third straight advance. Earlier, the metal reached $741.90,
the highest since Sept. 9, 2011 after Johnson Matthey Plc said
reserves in Russia, the world’s largest producer, are “pretty
much exhausted,” and sales this year may be only 3 metric tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
