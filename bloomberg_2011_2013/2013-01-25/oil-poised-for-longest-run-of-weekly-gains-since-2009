Oil completed a seventh weekly gain
in  New York , the longest run of advances in almost four years,
on speculation that stronger economic growth will boost demand.  Prices were little changed today as the euro strengthened
to an 11-month high against the dollar after the  European
Central Bank  said banks will hand back a greater amount of loans
than analysts estimated and German business confidence rose for
a third month in January. U.S. oil  demand  grew last week by the
most in a month, government data showed yesterday.  “The German confidence number is a pretty good sign that
the economy is improving,” said  Michael Lynch , president of
Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
 Massachusetts . “We have a better economic outlook and more
people are expecting stronger growth and higher oil demand.”  West  Texas  Intermediate for March delivery slid 7 cents to
settle at $95.88 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
ending the week with a 0.3 percent gain. Trading volume was 15
percent below the 100-day average at 3:10 p.m. Futures have
advanced 12 percent in the seven-week winning streak, the
longest since April 2009.  Brent for March delivery settled unchanged at $113.28 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume
was 20 percent above the 100-day average. The European benchmark
contract was at a premium of $17.40 after contracting to $15.16
on Jan. 17, the narrowest in almost six months.  Seaway Pipeline  The Brent-WTI spread widened by $1.83 on Jan. 23 after
 Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  said capacity was limited at the
Jones Creek terminal on the Seaway pipeline, cutting shipments
from Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for WTI futures, to
the  Gulf Coast . The delivery point in Katy, Texas, has allowed
Seaway to “make up the difference” from the restrictions, the
company said today.  Some 278 financial institutions will return 137.2 billion
euros ($184.4 billion) on Jan. 30, the first opportunity for
early repayment of the initial three-year loan, the Frankfurt-
based ECB said in a statement today. That compares with the
median forecast of 84 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists.  The German Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 104.2 from 102.4 in
December. That’s the highest since June and the third straight
gain. Economists predicted an increase to 103, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  The euro gained as much as 0.8 percent to $1.3479, the
highest level since February. A strengthening euro increases
dollar-denominated oil’s appeal as an investment alternative.  ‘Good Data’  “The German data is a boost for oil and the weak dollar
also helps,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at the
Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “We’ve had a week of good
economic data.”  The Labor Department reported yesterday that U.S. jobless
benefit  claims  fell to a five-year low last week. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index rose for an eighth day today, helping boost oil
futures.  Petroleum  consumption  in the U.S. climbed 3.9 percent in
the week ended Jan. 18 to 18.6 million barrels a day, the Energy
Information Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical
arm, reported yesterday. Gasoline demand grew 1.3 percent to
8.43 million barrels a day.  Advance Predicted  Oil may rise next week on stronger economic growth, a
Bloomberg survey showed. Eighteen of 36 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 50 percent, forecast crude will increase through
Feb. 1. Eleven respondents, or 31 percent, predicted a drop.
Seven said there would be little change.  Prices fell as much as 0.5 percent in early trading after
the Commerce Department reported  new U.S. homes  declined 7.3
percent to a 369,000 annual pace in December.  “The home sales data buck the trend of all the other good
data and deflate the enthusiasm,” said  Addison Armstrong ,
director of market research at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “It won’t be surprising to see some profit-taking
at the end of week. Oil is following equities.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 376,321
contracts as of 3:08 p.m. It totaled 639,215 contracts
yesterday, 29 percent higher than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.51 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
