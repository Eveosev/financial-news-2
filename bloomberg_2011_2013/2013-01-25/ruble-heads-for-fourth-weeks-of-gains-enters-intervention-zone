The ruble fell for the first time in
five days against the central bank’s dollar-euro basket as the
currency moved out of the zone traders say Bank Rossii targets
to curb gains. Bond yields fell.  The ruble lost 0.3 percent to 34.7209 against the basket,
seven kopeks weaker than the 34.65 level at which the regulator
may intervene, according to Ruslan Tongiev, head of financial
markets operations at OAO Promsvyazbank. The currency pared a
0.3 percent advance versus the dollar to trade up 0.1 percent at
30.0500 by 7 p.m. in Moscow for a 0.7 percent week gain. Ruble
notes rose as economic data stoked rate-cut bets.  The ruble surpassed 30 rubles to the dollar for the first
time since May 5 today as crude oil,  Russia ’s main export,
headed for its longest run of weekly increases since 2009 on
signs of global economic growth. Investment decreased the most
in 23 months in December as a dimming economic outlook prompted
businesses to cut spending, data showed.  The prospect of 29.5 or 29 rubles to the dollar is
“illusory” and the central bank will slow the ruble’s
appreciation to the end of the month, Promsvyazbank’s Tongiev
said by phone today.  Bank Rossii is due to publish data Jan. 28 that will show
whether it intervened on Jan. 24, when the ruble broke through
the level of 34.65 against basket for the first time in two
weeks. The ruble was 0.6 percent weaker against the euro at
40.4480.  “It looks as though the bulletproof resistance level” of
30.20 to the dollar has “surrendered” and “30 might prove to
be even stronger,” VTB Capital analysts Maxim Korovin and Anton Nikitin wrote in an e-mailed note.  Debt Rally  The yield on so-called OFZs due July 2022 fell for a third
day, declining five basis points to 6.61 percent, the lowest
level since January 10. The yield has dropped 11 basis points,
or 0.11 percentage point, this week.  Fixed-capital investment slid 0.7 percent in December, the
biggest decline since January 2011, the Federal Statistics
Service in Moscow said in a report today.  The data are “negative news for the ruble, but supportive
for OFZs” because they may prompt Bank Rossii to lower interest
rates, Vladimir Osakovskiy, chief economist for Bank of America
Corp in Moscow, wrote by e-mail.  The government’s next ruble-bond auction in January may be
held for the first time through Euroclear Bank SA, Deputy
Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said in an interview in Davos,
Switzerland this week. Russia has been preparing to give foreign
investors direct access to the domestic market instead of
dealing through local brokerages.  With foreign access, overseas holdings of OFZs will surge
fourfold from $11.5 billion this year $48.5 billion in 2015,
Gintaras Shlizhyus, an analyst with  Raiffeisen Bank
International AG (RBI) , wrote in an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
