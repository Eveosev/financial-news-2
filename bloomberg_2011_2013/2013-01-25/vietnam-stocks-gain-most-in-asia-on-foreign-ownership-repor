Vietnam’s  stocks  advanced the most
in Asia after reports the foreign ownership cap may be lifted
for some companies and the central bank may set a maximum limit
on cash payments for high-value items.  The  VN Index (VNINDEX)  rose for a third day, jumping 3 percent to
465.74 at 1:43 p.m. in Ho Chi Minh City and bound for the
biggest gain since Jan. 8.  Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial Bank
for Industry & Trade (CTG)  climbed 5.7 percent, poised for a record
advance.  Bao Viet Holdings (BVH)  surged 6.6 percent, heading for the
highest close since Jan. 10.  The State Securities Commission may allow some listed
companies to raise their foreign ownership limit above the
current 49 percent in the first quarter by issuing non-voting
shares, SaigonTimes reported. The central bank may limit cash
payments outside the banking system for items such as properties
and vehicles by June at the latest, according to a Tuoi Tre
report. The decree aims to reduce unofficial transactions to
help tackle theft and tax evasion, according to the report.  “Limiting cash payments will reduce risks and boost tax
revenue for the state budget, which is good for the economy,”
Tong Minh Tuan, head of research at Hanoi-based BIDV Securities
Co., said today. Stocks also reacted positively to reports on
foreign investment limits, he said.  SSC Chairman Vu Bang declined to comment on the report. Bui
Quang Tien, head of the payment department at the State Bank of
 Vietnam , declined to comment because he’s not authorized to
speak to the media.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
