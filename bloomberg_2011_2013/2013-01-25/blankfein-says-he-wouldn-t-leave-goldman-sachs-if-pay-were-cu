Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s  Lloyd Blankfein , whose bonus for last year almost doubled, said he
would stay as chief executive officer even if the company cut
his pay.  “Not today, no,” Blankfein said today in an interview on
CNBC, responding to a question about whether he would leave if
the New York-based firm paid him less.  Blankfein, 58, was granted $13.3 million in restricted
stock for last year that comprises about 70 percent of his total
bonus, a person with knowledge of the matter said last week. On
that basis, the total bonus is about $19 million including $5.7
million in cash, up from a $10 million stock-and-cash award for
2011. Blankfein, who is also the bank’s chairman, receives a $2
million salary.  “I’ve been in this firm for 30 years,” Blankfein said in
the interview at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos. “Most of my
interest in Goldman Sachs comes from trading in my partnership
interest for stock. So I’m more of a  shareholder  than an
employee.”  A $21 million total compensation package would be
Blankfein’s highest since his $68.5 million record in 2007, when
Goldman Sachs’s earnings per share were 75 percent higher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
