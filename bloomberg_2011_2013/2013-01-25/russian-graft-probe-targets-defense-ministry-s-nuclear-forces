Russia opened 13 criminal
investigations into corruption in the strategic missile forces
that operate the country’s nuclear arsenal, the latest in a
spate of anti-graft probes that have already triggered the
departure of Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov.  The ministry lost more than 90 million rubles ($3 million)
as military commanders abused their authority in awarding 16
contracts to redevelop land used for missile tests, according to
a statement on the General Prosecutor’s website today. Other
crimes include bribery and paying kickbacks, prosecutors said.  President  Vladimir Putin  fired Serdyukov in November over
an alleged $132 million fraud involving his subordinates.
Serdyukov, who orchestrated an overhaul of the Russian army
before leaving his post, has been questioned twice as a witness.  Frustration with graft, the worst among major economies
according to  Transparency International , helped fuel the biggest
anti-Putin protests since the Russian leader ascended to the
presidency in 1999. Putin, who returned to the Kremlin last year
after a stint as prime minister, is seeking to bolster the
government’s anti-corruption efforts.  Serdyukov’s replacement, Sergei Shoigu, the country’s
longest-serving Cabinet member, has begun reviewing his
predecessor’s decisions. Shoigu had previously headed the
Emergency Situations Ministry, which was involved in a
corruption investigation in 2003 during Putin’s first
presidential term.  To contact the reporter on this story:
