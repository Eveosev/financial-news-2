Phillips 66 (PSX) ’s Wood River refinery in
Illinois will restart the alkylation unit today, a person
familiar with the turnaround schedule said.  The unit was shut Jan. 22, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the information isn’t public. The
benzene extractor, a part of the unit, will close for work
beginning Feb. 28 for 22 days, the person said.  Rich Johnson , a company spokesman in Houston, declined to
comment.  Wood River can process as much as 356,000 barrels of crude
oil a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
