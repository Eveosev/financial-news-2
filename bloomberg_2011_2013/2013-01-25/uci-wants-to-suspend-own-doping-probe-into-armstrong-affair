The International Cycling Union
wants to suspend its own independent commission into the Lance
Armstrong doping affair because it is seeking a wider remit.  Speaking at the first procedural hearing of the UCI
Independent Commission in  London  today, the UCI said no amnesty
for witnesses who come forward to give evidence can go ahead
without changes to the  World Anti-Doping Agency  (WADA) code.  Instead, UCI counsel Ian Mill QC said the governing body
wants to establish a truth and reconciliation commission with
WADA to cover other sports, “and not be limited to cycling
alone.”  The hearing will reconvene at 12:15pm local London time
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
