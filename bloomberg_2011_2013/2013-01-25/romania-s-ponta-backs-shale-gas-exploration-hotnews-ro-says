Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta
said today he supports shale-gas exploration in the country,
 Hotnews.ro  reported.  Romania will make a final decision on drilling for shale
gas once it has confirmation of resources in about five years’
time, Ponta said, according to Hotnews.ro. Extraction would have
to meet European and global environmental standards, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
