Recovery in the financial markets
will probably be volatile due to political risks and because
some structural problems in Europe haven’t been addressed,  UBS
AG (UBSN)  Chairman  Axel Weber  said.  “Whilst the underlying trend is better, there is still a
lot of volatility in the market and it’s not going to be a
straight-line recovery,” Weber said during a Bloomberg
television interview in Davos, Switzerland today. “It’s going
to be bumpy, and therefore investors need to be prepared for
that push-back, for the mood in the market to turn.”  Sentiment has improved since the  European Central Bank  said
it would “backstop the system,” Weber said. Market confidence
over the year may be impacted by uncertainties stemming from
elections in Italy and Germany as well as Spain’s need for a
“huge amount of liquidity” as its bonds mature, he said.  “I think we’re going to have a very volatile situation
where risk-on, risk-off periods will just alter,” Weber said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
