Austria’s economic growth will be
muted over the next five years because of continued weakness in
the euro zone and weak consumption at home, the state-supported
Wifo research institute said.  Gross domestic product, the value of goods and services,
will increase an average 1.7 percent annually through 2017, Wifo
said today in an e-mail.  “After the 2012 dip in growth, the economic outlook in the
medium term remains muted,” Vienna-based Wifo said. “The
expansion won’t be enough to reduce unemployment trends.”  Austrian unemployment will grow to about 7.2 percent in
2017 from 7 percent last year, according to Wifo. The institute
confirmed its GDP growth forecasts of 1 percent this year and
1.8 percent in 2014. Economic growth in the period will peak in
2015 at 2 percent, Wifo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
