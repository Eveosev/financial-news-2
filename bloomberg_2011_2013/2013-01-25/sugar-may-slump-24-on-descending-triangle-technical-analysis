Raw sugar, the worst performer on
the S&P GSCI Commodity Index after Arabica coffee in the past
year, will probably plunge 24 percent over the next three months,
according to a technical analysis by Trading Central SA.  “Prices are making successive lower-highs and lower-lows
and are capped by a declining trend line in force since 2011’s
top,” said Ludwig Garric, an analyst at the Paris-based company,
who correctly predicted soybeans’ rally to a record last year.
That’s “signaling a downward trend,” he said.  Raw sugar plunged 49 percent from a 30-year intraday high
in February 2011 as farmers from  Brazil  to  Thailand  expanded
cane planting and boosted a global glut. The most-active
contract ended little changed at 18.49 cents a pound on the ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York  yesterday, extending this year’s
decline to 5.2 percent after a 16 percent drop in 2012.  “The confirmation of the descending triangle given by the
downward breakout of 18.8 cent-support calls for the extension
of the downward track towards 14 cents,” Garric said in an e-
mail dated Jan. 23.  World output will exceed demand by 7.8 million metric tons
this year, Czarnikow Group Ltd., the London-based sugar trader,
said Dec. 19, increasing the forecast for a surplus it made in
August by 9.9 percent. Rabobank International boosted its
estimate by about 12 percent to 6.6 million tons on Jan. 17.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. A descending triangle is a bearish
chart pattern showing a horizontal bottom under a historical
support level and a declining trend line, connecting lower highs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
