Nike Inc. (NKE) , the world’s largest
sporting-goods company, was fined 80,000 euros ($107,000) by a
French appeals court over charges it helped the Paris Saint-
Germain soccer team funnel additional money to players through
endorsements.  The fine was cut from the 150,000 euros levied by the lower
court in 2010. Nike lawyer Aurelien Hamelle declined to comment
immediately on the decision, and spokesmen for the company
didn’t immediately return a message seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
