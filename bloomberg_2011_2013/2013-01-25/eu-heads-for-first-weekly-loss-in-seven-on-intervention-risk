Romania ’s leu slid, heading for the
first weekly loss in seven, on bets the central bank may curb
the currency’s gain.  The currency weakened 0.2 percent to 4.3682 per euro by
5:38 p.m. in Bucharest, extending its retreat this week to 0.6
percent. It strengthened to 4.3228 per euro on Jan. 17, the
highest level in a year. Yields on Romania’s June 2016 euro-
denominated notes were little changed at 3.123 percent.  The “leu’s advance from current levels of 4.36 per euro
might keep market players wary of central bank interventions,”
Mihai Tantaru, a Bucharest-based analyst at ING Bank Romania SA,
wrote in a note today.  The  Finance Ministry  raised 1.1 billion lei ($339 million)
of 10-year bonds at a sale yesterday, almost double the target
of 600 million lei.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s
plans to include Romania in their benchmark emerging-market debt
indexes has increased the appeal of the nation’s debt and
currency.  The leu’s gain yesterday “occurred on hefty trading
volumes, probably related to foreign inflows into the 10-year
bond sale,” Tantaru said.  The central bank will need euros to make bailout loan
repayments to the  International Monetary Fund  this year.  Romania’s local currency debt is eligible for inclusion in
the JPMorgan’s GBI-EM Index Series in a rebalance on March 1,
the U.S. bank said on Jan. 15. Barclays said on Nov. 6 it will
add Nigeria and Romania to its emerging-market local-currency
government bond index from March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
