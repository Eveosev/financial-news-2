Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  rose to its
highest in three years in Mumbai trading after profit beat
analysts’ estimates on higher demand for its Ertiga minivans and
Swift DZire sedans.  Maruti, the nation’s biggest carmaker by volume, climbed
3.9 percent to close at 1,599.45 rupees. The stock, which was
the biggest gainer on the benchmark BSE India Sensitive Index,
was at the highest level since December 2009.  Third-quarter  net income  at  Suzuki Motor Corp. (7269) ’s Indian
unit more than doubled to 5.01 billion rupees ($93 million), the
New Delhi-based company said. That beat the 4.89 billion-rupee
median of 38  analysts’ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
 carmaker , which resumed production at its Manesar factory in
August after a monthlong shutdown following a deadly riot, has
seen local deliveries rebound as it introduced new models.  “Next year, Maruti will have more capacity coming on
stream, which will improve product mix,” said Basudeb Banerjee,
an analyst at Quant Broking Pvt. in Mumbai. “And the yen is
also declining which is positive for the company.”  The carmaker plans to spend 17 billion rupees to set up a
new diesel-engine factory that will be ready by 2014. The plant,
near  New Delhi , will have a capacity to produce as many as
300,000 engines a year, it said in April.  The Japanese yen has declined more than 5 percent against
the dollar since the start of the year, extending a 11 percent
drop in 2012.  Sales rose 46 percent to 109.6 billion rupees in the
quarter, Maruti said. The median of 38 analysts’ estimates
compiled by Bloomberg was for revenue of 109.8 billion rupees.  Local Deliveries  Local deliveries at Maruti are set to increase as much as 6
percent in the current financial year after dropping 11 percent
in the previous 12 months, Mayank Pareek, head of sales, said
last month.  Domestic sales of Maruti rose 5.9 percent in December,
spurred by demand for its Ertiga minivan, which it introduced in
April.  The  Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers  lowered its
full-year domestic car sales forecast on Jan. 9 to as little as
no growth, the third cut in six months after local deliveries in
December fell 13 percent to 141,083 cars, the second consecutive
monthly decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
