South Korea’s won fell to its lowest
level this month as foreign funds extended sales of local
stocks, and on regional political concerns after  North Korea 
threatened to conduct a nuclear test.  A planned “high-level” atomic test and long-range rocket
launches will target the U.S., according to a statement from the
National Defense Commission in Pyongyang carried by the official
Korean Central News Agency yesterday. The White House said North
Korea’s threat to conduct a nuclear weapons test is “needlessly
provocative” and will lead to further isolation and sanctions.
Overseas investors  sold  more of the nation’s shares than they
bought on all days but one this week.  “Continued selling of shares by foreigners is keeping the
won lower, while the North Korean threat increases the
geopolitical risk,” said Hong Seok Chan, analyst at Daishin
Economic Research Institute in  Seoul . “Exporters selling
dollars toward the month-end are keeping the won from weakening
further.”  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,069.55 per dollar as of 10:24
a.m. in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 1,070.95 earlier, lowest level since Dec. 28. The Kospi
index of shares slipped for a third day, falling 0.3 percent
today.  The currency declined 1.2 percent this week as Finance
Minister Bahk Jae Wan vowed to curb volatility, saying the won’s
recent gains were too steep. The government is “all ready” for
new measures, Bahk said Jan. 23, declining to comment on when
they will be announced. The currency touched 1,054.49 on Jan.
15, a level not seen since August 2011. It climbed 8.3 percent
in 2012, the region’s best performance.  One-month implied volatility in the won, a gauge of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, dropped
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 6.02 percent today
and was 85 points higher than a week ago.  The yield on  South Korea ’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 was unchanged at 2.82 percent today and was three basis
points lower than five days ago, Korea Exchange prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
