Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  reported a 51
percent slump in operating profit after the won’s gains eroded
the value of exports and said it expects a “difficult year,”
sending the stock to the lowest in more than two years.  Fourth-quarter  operating income  tumbled to 404.2 billion
won ($377 million) from 826.9 billion a year earlier, the Seoul-
based company said in a regulatory filing today. That was 35
percent below the average estimate of 621.4 billion won in a
Bloomberg survey of seven analysts.  Net income  fell 6.7 percent
to 737.5 billion won.  Kia’s shares fell as much as 5.2 percent after Chief
Financial Officer Park Han Woo said 2013 will be a “difficult
year” as the won posted the biggest gain last quarter among
Asian currencies against the dollar. The automaker’s results
underscore how South Korean exporters, including  Hyundai Motor
Co. (005380)  and Samsung Electronics Co., are bracing for the end of a
four-year period of favorable exchange rates.  “The results were far worse than I had expected,” Lee Sang Hyun, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co. said by
phone. “I don’t think we can expect profitability to improve
anytime soon.”  Kia fell 4.9 percent to 49,750 won at the close in Seoul
trading, the lowest since November 2010. The benchmark  Kospi
index (KOSPI)  declined 0.9 percent.  Korea Exports  The won strengthened 4.4 percent last quarter against the
dollar, gaining more than any other major Asian currency,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Hyundai Motor Group,
the umbrella group of Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia, expects the won
to strengthen more this year, limiting exports, Kia said in an
e-mail on Jan. 4.  Overseas sales account for 75 percent to 80 percent of the
Seoul-based automakers’ sales. Each 10-won gain in the Korean
currency’s value against the U.S. dollar lowers Kia’s profit by
about 80 billion won, according to the statement. Kia forecast
the won to continue strengthening to 1,050 won this year,
according to an e-mailed statement on Jan. 4.  Samsung Electronics, the world’s largest maker of mobile
phones, TVs and computer-memory chips, fell to the lowest in
almost two months today after saying the strengthening won may
cut operating profit by at least 3 trillion won this year.  Currency Gain  The won is projected to gain more than 3 percent to 1,030
per dollar, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of analysts. The yen will probably end 2013 at 90 per
dollar which would be the weakest finish to a year since 2009,
the surveys show.  This trend won’t help Kia, which has forecast since early
January that deliveries will rise 1.1 percent to 2.75 million
vehicles this year, the slowest growth since 2006.  Hyundai Motor, which owns 34 percent of Kia, yesterday
delivered fourth-quarter net income, operating profit and
revenue that missed average analyst estimates. South Korea’s
largest automaker said quarterly profit fell 5.5 percent to 1.89
trillion won, from 2 trillion won a year earlier.  Provisions for overstating fuel-efficiency ratings in the
U.S. also dragged down fourth-quarter earnings at Kia.  Kia, together with Hyundai, said in November it overstated
the fuel efficiency of some models in the U.S. This incurred
costs of about 200 billion won in fourth-quarter earnings to
reimburse customers, Joo Woo Jeong, a finance director at Kia,
said on a conference call today.  ‘Difficult Year’  “We expect a difficult year both at home and abroad, and
expect this year’s profits to be similar to 2012,” Park, Kia’s
CFO, said during the conference call.  The inflated ratings, for models including Kia’s Soul wagon
and Hyundai’s Elantra sedan, led the two automakers to offer
prepaid fuel cards to owners of 900,000 vehicles bought in the
past two years.  China  helped Kia ease the fallout from the currency and the
fuel-economy claims in U.S. The company’s sales in the country
jumped 11 percent in the last quarter after buyers in China
favored vehicles from the South Korean carmaker, shunning
Japanese autos because of a territorial dispute.  That helped boost the quarterly net income as the gains
from China are recorded as equity interests and aren’t reflected
in the operating income figure, according to Park.  Kia expects to sell about 500,000 units in China this year,
after increasing deliveries to the world’s largest auto market
by 11 percent to 480,566 vehicles in 2012.  In  Europe , the automaker’s sales rose 14 percent during
2012, fueled by sales of the Cee’d hatchback and Sportage sport
utility vehicles. The company aims to sell 335,000 units this
year, up 1 percent, according to the company’s e-mailed
statement.  Kia’s U.S. sales were up 15 percent last year, data on
company’s  website  shows. This is above the average industrywide
13 percent rise in vehicle sales, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This year, the company plans to boost U.S. sales by
2.2 percent to 570,000 units, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
