Total SA (FP)  plans to increase security
at its oil and gas fields in countries such as  Algeria  as a
consequence of last week’s deadly hostage siege, Chief Executive
Officer Christophe de Margerie said.  “It’s awful, what happened,” de Margerie said in a  France 
24 radio interview from Davos, Switzerland. “Of course this
will have an impact. All those sites will have to be even more
protected.”  The assault on the remote gas facility near In Amenas,
Algeria, last week left at least 38 hostages dead, according to
French officials. Militants of the al-Qaeda-linked al
Mulathameen group claimed responsibility for the attack, which
they said was a reaction to the deployment of French troops to
stop jihadists taking over neighboring  Mali . The group has said
other attacks may follow.  The increased security won’t necessarily lead to higher oil
prices, de Margerie said.  “It’s part of the global cost of energy,” he said.  The company has already begun intensifying security for
expatriate employees in countries such as Algeria and Mali,
moving them to more secure locations and in some cases even back
to France, de Margerie said.  “We have to continue to work,” he added. “We have to be
even more careful about their protection. Life is a priority.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
