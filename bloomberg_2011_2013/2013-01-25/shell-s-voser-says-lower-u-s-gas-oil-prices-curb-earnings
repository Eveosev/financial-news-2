Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Voser  said lower North American crude
and gas prices will curb earnings at Europe’s largest oil
company.  Shell, which last year produced more gas than oil for the
first time, scaled back investment in the U.S. after gas prices
fell to a decade-low in April. Last year, the U.S. oil benchmark
West Texas Intermediate averaged $94.15 a barrel, about 18
percent below Europe’s Brent oil, because of increased output
and export capacity restrictions.  “For most of the Americas you had the WTI effect, and you
had the  Canadian prices  because of that very low, and that has
affected our profitability,” Voser said today in a Bloomberg TV
interview in Davos,  Switzerland .  Shell’s fourth-quarter earnings excluding one-time items
and inventory changes are expected to rise 42 percent to about
$6.8 billion, based on a Bloomberg  survey  of six analysts. The
results are due out on Jan. 31.  Brent oil, which has been trading above $100 a barrel since
July, and rising U.S. energy prices, will boost industry
earnings this year, Voser said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
