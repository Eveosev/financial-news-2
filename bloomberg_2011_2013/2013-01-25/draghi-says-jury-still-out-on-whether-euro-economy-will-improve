European Central Bank President
Mario Draghi said while conditions on financial markets have
improved considerably, policy makers are still waiting for signs
that the economy has turned for the better.  The ECB’s bond-purchase program “turned out to be very
helpful in removing the tailrisks, the risks to the euro as
such,” Draghi said during a discussion at the World Economic
Forum in Davos today. “Are we satisfied with that? The jury is
still out. We haven’t seen an equal momentum on the real side of
the economy.”  Financial markets have rallied since the ECB said last year
that it would buy unlimited amounts of governments bonds to
counter speculation of a euro breakup if certain conditions are
met. The program hasn’t been used yet, and the 17-nation euro
area has slipped into recession as governments cut spending to
rein in deficits.  “Fiscal consolidation is unavoidable,” Draghi said.
“There can’t be any sustainable growth or, for this matter, any
sustainable equity achieved through an endless creation of debt.
But we have to admit that fiscal consolidation is contractionary
in the short term.”  Draghi said conditions are “considerably more favorable”
than last year.  “The perception we have at the ECB is that the level of
economic activity is in the process of stabilizing at a very low
level,” he said. “We foresee a gradual recovery in the second
part of the year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
