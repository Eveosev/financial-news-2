Orascom Construction Industries, the
Egyptian contractor transferring its stock to an Amsterdam-based
unit, said it received binding commitments for the deal from
investors holding 80 percent of the shares.  OCI NV has conversions and and commitments for 95 percent
of outstanding global depository receipts, the company said in a
statement today. In addition, 8 percent of shareholders will
tender their stock in a local offer, it said.  OCI said Jan. 19 it had secured $2 billion from investors
led by Bill Gates’s Cascade Investment LLC to help transfer its
listing to NYSE Euronext Amsterdam. OCI NV, which plans to
absorb all local stock and global depositary receipts of Cairo-
based Orascom Construction, hopes the Amsterdam listing will
help lower borrowing costs, Chief Executive Officer Nassef Sawiris said on Jan. 18.  OCI NV said that investors including the Sawiris family and
Abraaj Capital, holding 140 million shares and representing 91
percent of Orascom’s Regulation S global depositary receipts,
accepted the offer to exchange shares.  Trading of OCI NV shares began today, the company said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
