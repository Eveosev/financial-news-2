Koji Wada, a  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  banker in  Tokyo , was appointed head coach of the Keio
University rugby team.  Wada, vice president and salesman in the fixed income,
currency and commodity division, will start the role on Feb. 24,
according to a statement released today by the Keio University
rugby alumni association.  It hasn’t been decided whether Wada, 34, will remain
employed by Goldman Sachs, said Sumiko Iwadate, a spokeswoman
for the U.S. bank in Tokyo. The Asahi newspaper reported his
appointment earlier today.  Wada joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2001 after
graduating from Keio, where he played rugby and helped the team
win the university championship in the 1999-2000 season,
according to the statement. Keio hasn’t won it since then.  College rugby matches in Japan, such as the annual fixture
between Keio and Tokyo rival  Waseda University , regularly draw
thousands of fans. Masanori Mochida, head of Goldman Sachs’s
Japan unit, played fullback for Keio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
