Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  held half the global smartphone market last year as
shipments worldwide gained 43 percent, Strategy Analytics said.  Global shipments rose to a record 700 million units in 2012
from 491 million a year earlier, the market researcher said in a
statement. Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung boosted its share to
30.4 percent from 19.9 percent in 2011, according to the
statement. Apple held 19.4 percent of the market, compared with
19 percent previously.  The rising popularity of Samsung’s Galaxy and Apple’s
iPhone for watching videos and playing games on the go has
hobbled third-ranked  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , which had set the previous
record for smartphone shipments in 2010, Strategy Analytics
said. Nokia’s share was cut to 5 percent from 15.8 percent
previously.  “Large marketing budgets, extensive distribution channels
and attractive product portfolios have enabled Samsung and Apple
to tighten their grip on the smartphone industry,”  Linda Sui,
analyst at Boston-based Strategy Analytics, said in the
statement.  Nokia “still lacks a true hero model in its range
that can be considered an Apple iPhone or Samsung S3 killer.”  Samsung’s global smartphone shipments more than doubled to
213 million units in 2012, compared with 97.4 million in 2011,
Strategy Analytics said. Apple  shipments  rose to 135.8 million
units from 93 million. Nokia shipments fell by more than half to
35 million units from 77.3 million.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
