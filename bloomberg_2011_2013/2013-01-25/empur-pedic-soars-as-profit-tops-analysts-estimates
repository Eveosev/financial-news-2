Tempur-Pedic International Inc. (TPX) , the
mattress maker that agreed to acquire rival  Sealy Corp. (ZZ)  in
September, advanced after fourth-quarter profit topped estimates
and sales declined less than predicted.  Tempur-Pedic gained 6.4 percent to $40.79 at the close in
 New York . The stock had fallen 40 percent last year, while the
Standard & Poor’s Midcap Consumer Discretionary Sector Index
 advanced  22 percent.  Tempur-Pedic International, which is trying to reinvigorate
sales amid increasing competition, agreed to buy KKR & Co.-
backed Sealy for about $229 million. The companies are currently
cooperating with the Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust review
of the transaction and expect to complete the deal in the first
half of 2013.  “We remain very confident in our company’s growth
potential and our strong brand, and are very excited about our
proposed combination with Sealy,” Mark Sarvary, chief executive
officer of the Lexington, Kentucky-based company, said in a
statement yesterday.  Fourth-quarter profit excluding some items was 60 cents a
share. That topped the average analyst estimate of 55 cents,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Net sales dropped 7
percent to $341.1 million. Analysts had projected $338.9
million. The company forecast annual adjusted profit of $2.55 a
share on sales of $1.425 billion. Analysts had estimated
earnings of $2.72 and revenue of $1.427 billion.  Sealy, which reported fourth-quarter results Jan. 23,
recorded adjusted profit of 4 cents a share, compared with a 3-
cent loss predicted by analysts. The shares gained 0.5 percent
to $2.17 at the close.  Select Comfort Corp. (SCSS) , another mattress maker that reported
earnings yesterday, today tumbled 18 percent to $23.16 after
quarterly profit missed estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
