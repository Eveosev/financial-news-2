Canadian  stocks  fell as metals
producers slumped, offsetting economic optimism after the
 European Central Bank  said banks will repay more of their loans
than forecast and U.S. corporate earnings topped forecasts.  Kinross Gold Corp. and Eldorado Gold Corp. slumped more
than 5.1 percent as the gold price fell to a two-week low.
Silver Wheaton Corp. and Silver Standard Resources Inc. lost at
least 1.8 percent as the price of the metal declined.  Pacific
Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  climbed 3.6 percent after one of its
development partners discovered oil off the coast of  Brazil .
 Agrium Inc. (AGU)  gained 1.3 percent after an analyst with Desjardins
Securities Inc. raised his rating for the stock to a buy.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 7.59 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 12,816.03 in Toronto. The benchmark gauge
increased 0.7 percent this week for a fourth week of gains, the
longest stretch in almost a year.  “The whole world has had a nice recovery,”  Barry Schwartz , who helps manage C$480 million ($476 million) as a
 fund manager  at Toronto-based Baskin Financial Services, said in
a phone interview. “So far the U.S. profits have been very
strong. I would suspect we’re going to see that go across the
border. That will lead us to continue to rally as we are.”  Some 278 European financial institutions will return 137.2
billion euros ($184.4 billion) on Jan. 30, the first opportunity
for early repayment of the initial three-year loan, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. That compares
with the median forecast of 84 billion euros in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.  U.S. Earnings  About 76 percent of the 147 companies in the  S&P 500  that
have released results so far this quarter exceeded profit
projections. Analysts are turning more optimistic about U.S.
earnings, boosting their projections for fourth-quarter profit
growth to 4 percent from 2.9 percent at the beginning of the
month, the data show.  Gold producers  contributed  most to declines in the S&P/TSX.
Trading volume was 7.1 percent lower than the 30-day average.  The S&P/TSX Gold  subindex  fell 2.5 percent to its lowest
level since August as 30 of 31 members declined.  Kinross sank 5.1 percent to C$8.58 and Eldorado Gold
tumbled 5.3 percent to C$11.55. Gold for February delivery lost
0.8 percent to settle at $1,656.60 an ounce in New York, for a
third straight day of declines.  Silver Wheaton lost 2.1 percent to C$34.55 and Silver
Standard Resources slipped 1.8 percent to C$12.40. Silver for
March delivery fell 1.6 percent to $31.206 an ounce.  Kangaroo-1  Pacific Rubiales rose 3.6 percent to C$23.26 after  Karoon
Gas Australia Ltd. (KAR)  said it has found oil at the Kangaroo-1
exploration well in Brazil’s  Santos Basin . Pacific Rubiales in
September agreed to purchase a 35 percent stake in Karoon’s
exploration blocks off Brazil.  Agrium, operator of the largest U.S. network of
agricultural retail outlets, added 1.3 percent to a record
C$115.36.  John Hughes , an analyst with Desjardins, raised his rating
for the stock to buy from hold while increasing his price target
to C$125 from C$106.30 after the company reported fourth-quarter
earnings that exceeded analysts’ estimates. Profit excluding
one-time items will be “slightly above” $2 a share, buoyed by
demand for crop nutrients, Calgary-based Agrium said in a
statement yesterday. In November, the company forecast $1.50 to
$1.90 a share.  RIM, Lenovo  Research in Motion Ltd. fell 1.1 percent to C$17.61. Canada
would closely examine any proposal for a tie-up between Chinese
computer-maker Lenovo Group Ltd. and RIM, Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said in an interview at the  World Economic Forum ’s
annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland yesterday.  The BlackBerry maker jumped 2.9 percent yesterday to the
highest level in more than a year after Lenovo said it was
considering a bid among other options for expanding its mobile-
devices business. RIM, Canada’s largest-listed technology
company, has said it’s assessing strategic options after losing
market share to Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co.  To contact the reporters on this story:
