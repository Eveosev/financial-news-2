The 100 wealthiest people on the
planet added $44.5 billion to their collective net worth this
week as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index had its longest winning
streak since 2004.  The 39-year-old  Google Inc. (GOOG)  founders  Sergey Brin  and  Larry
Page  added a combined $2.2 billion to their fortune as shares of
the Mountain View, California-based company rose the most since
2011. The company reported profit on Wednesday that topped
analysts’ estimates as advertisers boosted spending to reach
consumers during the holiday season. Brin and Page rank 25th and
27th in the world with net worths of about $22 billion,
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.  “There’s obviously a general positive momentum in equity
and the tech sector, so Google is following suit,” said Russ Certo, a managing director at New York-based Brean Capital LLC,
in a telephone interview. “What’s driving it is the holiday
shopping season. It was quite beneficial to Google, as their
profit was more than any period since they went public in
2004.”  U.S. stocks rose, sending the S&P 500 to its first eight-
day rally since 2004, as earnings beat estimates at 10 of 13
companies that reported results since the close of markets
yesterday. Per-share profit has exceeded the average analyst
estimate at about 76 percent of the 147 companies in the index
that released results so far in the reporting season, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 gained 1.14 percent during the week to close at
1502.96 in New York. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.94
percent, closing at 289.72  Slim, Buffett  Mexican telecommunications magnate  Carlos Slim , 72, remains
the richest person in the world, with a fortune of $78.3
billion, up $730 million for the week. Microsoft co-founder  Bill
Gates , 57, is second with a net worth of $64.3 billion. The
Redmond, Washington-based firm reported lower profit on higher
revenue Thursday, after the company spent more money to market
its Windows operating system and lure consumers flocking to
tablets and smart phones.  The world’s largest software maker is also planning to
provide part of the financing for a leveraged buyout of  Dell
Inc. (DELL)  with Silver Lake Management LLC.  Europe’s richest man,  Amancio Ortega , the 76-year-old
founder of Inditex SA, the world’s biggest clothing retailer and
owner of the Zara clothing chain, is No. 3 on the index with a
net worth of $59.6 billion, $7.1 billion ahead of  Warren
Buffett , 82.  Icahn Feud  Billionaire  Carl Icahn , reviving a decade-old feud with
hedge-fund manager  William Ackman , said the founder of Pershing
Square Capital Management LP is taking “inordinate” risks in a
wager against Herbalife Ltd. disclosed last year.  The 76-year-old, who spent more than seven years wrangling
with Ackman in court over $4.5 million, said in an interview on
Bloomberg TV Thursday that Ackman’s assertion he was shining a
spotlight on Herbalife, the marketer of weight-loss and
nutritional supplements, was “disingenuous.” Icahn ranks 38th
on the index with a net worth of $19.5 billion.  This week, Bloomberg.com unveiled the ranking with
transparent net worth calculations and  data visualization . The
