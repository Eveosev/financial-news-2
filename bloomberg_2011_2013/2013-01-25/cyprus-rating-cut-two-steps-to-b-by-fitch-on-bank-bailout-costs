Cyprus’s credit rating was cut two
levels to B by  Fitch Ratings  on concern the amount of government
support needed for the nation’s banking sector is likely to be
higher than previous estimates.  Total recapitalization costs of the banking sector may
climb as high as 10 billion euros ($13.5 billion), Fitch said in
a statement today. If fully realized, it would increase the size
of the official support program for the Cypriot government to
more than 17 billion euros, the ratings company said.  Cyprus, which requested a financial rescue in June, is
still negotiating the size and terms with the European Union and
the  International Monetary Fund . The package is due to cover the
government as well as banks weakened by their exposure to the
neighboring Greek economy.  The downgrade from BB- by Fitch follows a three-level
reduction to Caa3 by Moody’s Investors Service on Jan. 10. Fitch
has a negative outlook on the rating of Cyprus.  Cyprus’s debt to gross-domestic-product ratio may rise to
150 percent this year, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
