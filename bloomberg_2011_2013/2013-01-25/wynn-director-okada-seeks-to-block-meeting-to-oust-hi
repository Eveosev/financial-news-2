Kazuo Okada asked a federal judge to
block a special  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  shareholders’ meeting
scheduled for Feb. 22 at which they are to vote on a proposal to
remove him from the board.  The Jan. 24 filing in Las Vegas federal court came after
the Japanese billionaire lost a bid in Nevada state court Jan.
15 to dismiss a lawsuit by the casino operator. Wynn sought in
that case to remove him as a director after forcibly redeeming
his 20 percent stake in the company last year.  The special meeting next month is part of “a calculated
effort” by Chief Executive Officer Steve Wynn “to
reconsolidate power in his hands” after criticism of Wynn’s
efforts to open a new gaming house in Macau,  China , Okada
alleged in court papers.  Wynn contends Okada and his associates made payments to
Philippine gaming officials in violation of U.S. anti-bribery
laws. Okada has said his actions were not illegal.  The case is Okada v. Wynn Resorts, 13-CV-136, U.S. District
Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
