China  selected five foreign
institutional investors to trade stock-index futures in the
country, according to an official from the  China Financial
Futures Exchange .  The exchange approved the five qualified foreign
institutional investors “recently,” said the official, who
didn’t identify them and asked not to be named because the
information isn’t public. The QFIIs may trade the futures only
for hedging purposes, China Business News reported today.  China is seeking to attract more foreign money into its
capital markets by broadening the range of investment
instruments available to foreign institutions. Policy makers can
increase the investment limit on QFIIs 10-fold, Guo Shuqing,
chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said
Jan. 14.  The CSRC increased the total allotment under the QFII
program to $80 billion in April. More than 200 institutions have
obtained QFII status as of December, according to the watchdog.
The investors together have about $37.4 billion approved for
investment in China’s capital markets, according to the
country’s foreign exchange regulator.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
