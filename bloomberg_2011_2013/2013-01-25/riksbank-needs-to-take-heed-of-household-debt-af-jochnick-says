Swedish policy makers need to take
into account risks stemming from household debt when setting
interest rates as the nation works to set up a better oversight
framework to combat financial imbalances, Riksbank First Deputy
Governor Kerstin af Jochnick said.  “It’s desirable that the Riksbank should be able to use the
policy rate to an even greater extent to stabilize inflation and
the real economy in the future, and that more appropriate tools
than the repo rate can be used to reduce the risks of financial
imbalances,” she said in the text of a speech in  Stockholm 
today. “A functioning framework for macroprudential policy can
improve the conditions for ensuring that the Riksbank attains
its two main objectives: price stability and financial
stability.”  The Swedish central bank has taken record-high household
debt into consideration when setting rates in the past year to
prevent low borrowing costs from triggering a housing bubble.
That has hurt economic growth by strengthening the Swedish
currency, Finance Minister Anders Borg said last week.  Sweden , which exports about half of its output, is
suffering from slowing demand from abroad as countries in  Europe 
are cutting spending to reduce debt. That prompted the central
bank to cut its main lending for a fourth time since December
2011 to 1 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
