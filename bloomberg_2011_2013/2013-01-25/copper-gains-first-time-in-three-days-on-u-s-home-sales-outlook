Copper climbed for the first time in
three days, heading for a second weekly advance, as a report may
today show new-home sales increased in the U.S., the world’s
second-biggest user of the metal, boosting the demand outlook.  The metal for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.4
percent to $8,126.50 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
and was at $8,121 at 11:59 a.m. in Seoul. The price has advanced
0.7 percent this week. The contract for delivery in May gained
0.5 percent to 58,910  yuan  ($9,470) a ton on the Shanghai
Futures Exchange.  New-home sales picked up to a 385,000 annual rate for the
month, the best showing since April 2010, according to the
survey median ahead of a Commerce Department report. Data
yesterday showed Chinese manufacturing expanded at the fastest
rate in two years, boosting confidence that the biggest buyer of
the metal is leading a global recovery.  “We could see a small tick-up in prices should U.S. new
home sales improve in line with expectations,” Nick Trevethan,
an analyst at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., wrote
in a report today.  The U.S. economy picked up across much of the country last
month, the Federal Reserve said Jan. 16, as homebuilding jumped
to a four-year high in December.  Copper traders are bullish for a third consecutive week as
11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect prices to rise next
week. Six were bearish and a further five were neutral.  Futures for delivery in March rose 0.4 percent to $3.6925 a
pound on the Comex in New York. On the LME, aluminum, zinc and
nickel also climbed, while lead fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
