QGOG Constellation SA (QGOG) , an oil and
natural gas driller that works for Brazil’s state-owned energy
company, is seeking to raise more than $500 million from an
initial public offering.  QGOG is offering 27.5 million common shares for $19 to $21
each, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission today. Underwriters can purchase another
4.125 million shares within 30 days. Net proceeds for QGOG may
be an estimated $517.8 million to $596.8 million after deducting
expenses related to the offering, according to the filing.  QGOG, a unit of the Brazilian industrial conglomerate
Queiroz Galvao SA, on Jan. 7 became the country’s first company
to file for an IPO this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It plans to trade on the  New York  Stock Exchange
using the QGOG symbol. The company has offices in Luxembourg and
Rio de Janeiro, according to its website.  QGOG had a $10.9 billion contract backlog as of Sept. 30,
according to the filing. It has performed drilling services for
state-controlled  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , or Petrobras, since
1981. Petrobras represented about 94 percent of the driller’s
gross revenue in the nine-month period ending Sept. 30,
according to the filing.  QGOG said it plans as much as $4.2 billion of investments
from October 2012 to December 2015. The company also may
consider acquisitions of drilling assets or investing in
contract drilling companies.  The offering is being coordinated by  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
 Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Credit Suisse
Group AG and  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , according to the filing.  To contact the reporters on this story:
