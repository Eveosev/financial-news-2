RusPetro Plc (RPO) , a producer of oil in
Siberia, climbed the most in 11 months in London trading after
saying it will strengthen its finances and start up an upgraded
processing unit next month following last year’s missed targets.  The  shares  rose as much as 17 percent, the biggest advance
since Feb. 29, 2012. RusPetro plans to sell as much as $350
million in bonds, according to a person familiar with the sale
who declined to be identified.  Standard & Poor’s  assigned the
offering a B- rating.  RusPetro, developing deposits in Siberia, slumped by as
much as 44 percent after saying on Jan. 4 it missed a year-end
output target of 10,400 barrels a day because of a lack of
capacity to process higher-than-expected condensate volumes.  The oil producer said today the notes will repay Sberbank
loans and fund field development. The Russian  state bank  will
provide a $50 million  credit line .  RusPetro also plans to convert a $62.8 million loan from
investor Limolines Transport Ltd. into shares at the oil
producer’s initial public offering price of 134 pence apiece,
subject to the outcome of a shareholder meeting scheduled for
Feb. 18.  RusPetro’s debts to Sberbank totaled $289 million as of
June 30, the most recent presentation on its website showed.  A heat-exchange system to increase condensate processing is
expected to start next month, after which total production will
rise to 9,000 barrels a day, the company said today.  “Don’t get too excited just yet,” said Alexander Burgansky, an oil and gas analyst at Otkritie Capital. The
company’s reduced exit targets for 2013 and 2014 seem unrelated
to delays in infrastructure work, he said.  Oil and condensate output will rise to 13,000 barrels a day
by December and average 10,000 barrels in 2013. RusPetro sees an
exit rate of 20,000 barrels in 2014 and 31,000 barrels in 2015.  The stock was up 8.8 percent at 51 pence as of 11:22 p.m.
