Palladium reserves in  Russia , the
world’s largest producer of the metal, are “pretty much
exhausted” and sales this year may be only 3 metric tons,
according to  Johnson Matthey Plc. (JMAT)   Russian inventory sales dropped 68 percent to 250,000
ounces last year from 775,000 ounces in 2011, according to
Johnson Matthey. Sales from state stockpiles are expected to
range from “zero to several tons” in 2013, Anton Berlin,
deputy chief of ZAO Normetimpex, OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel’s sales
arm, told RBC TV yesterday.  “Maybe 3 tons this year, and that will be it,”  Peter Duncan , general manager of market research at Johnson Matthey,
told reporters in  London  today. Three tons is equivalent to
96,452 troy ounces. “Russian state stockpiles have been
dwindling and are now pretty much exhausted.”  Shrinking Russian stockpiles at a time when output is
falling helped send the metal into the biggest shortage in 12
years. Output in South Africa, the second-biggest producer, was
disrupted by labor disputes and strikes, while lower grades
contributed to a decline in Russia.  Palladium for immediate delivery gained 0.5 percent to
$731.50 an ounce by 3:44 p.m. in London, rebounding from losses
earlier today of as much as 0.6 percent. Palladium, last
quarter’s best-performing precious metal, has risen 3.9 percent
this year after advancing 7.5 percent in 2012.  Supply Disruptions  Palladium supply declined 12 percent in 2012 to 6.48
million ounces on the South African disruptions, Duncan said.
That compared with 6.57 million ounces forecast by Johnson
Matthey in a Nov. 13 report, when the company said supply would
lag demand by 915,000 ounces in 2012, the most since 2000.  Platinum supply dropped 10 percent to 5.68 million ounces
because of declines in top producer  South Africa , coming to less
than the 5.84 million ounces forecast in November, according to
Johnson Matthey, which publishes research on platinum and
related metals and produces catalysts that use the metals to
reduce harmful auto emissions. Zimbabwe was the only major
producing nation to increase output, Duncan said.  Platinum supply probably will be curbed further because of
difficulties in South Africa, while autocatalyst demand is
expected to stay “flat” this year, before a “much stronger”
2014, Duncan said. Platinum use in off-road vehicles will expand
from about 100,000 ounces a year to several hundred thousand
ounces in coming years, he said.  Global net demand for platinum grew by about 4 percent to
6.17 million ounces, down from the previously forecast 6.24
million ounces, Duncan said. Gross automotive industry demand
was steady at 3 million ounces in 2012 despite  Europe ’s economic
slump, he said.  Platinum, up 9.3 percent since the start of the year, was
little changed at $1,682.99 an ounce in London today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
