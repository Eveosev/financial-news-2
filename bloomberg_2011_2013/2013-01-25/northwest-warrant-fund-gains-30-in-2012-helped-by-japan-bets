Northwest Warrant Fund Ltd., run by
a Hong Kong manager with $605 million in assets,  returned  30
percent in 2012, beating Asia-focused peers, with increased bets
on a Japanese equity market recovery.  The $17 million fund run by Northwest Investment Management
Ltd.  gained  24 percent in the final two months when it increased
allocations to Japan by 18 percentage points to 66 percent, said
Mark Smith, its head of business development. The average Asia-
focused hedge fund returned under 10 percent last year,
according to an  index  compiled by Singapore-based data provider
Eurekahedge Pte.  Northwest is wagering on the new Japanese leadership led by
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to pursue aggressive monetary policy
and fiscal stimulus to rejuvenate the world’s third-largest
economy. The fund, which controls about $420 million worth of
convertible bonds, has started to further expand its  Japan 
investment on expectations that the weakening yen will help
improve earnings outlook for Japanese exporters and benefit
banks by boosting the value of stocks and other assets, said
Chief Executive Officer George Philips.  “To see the yen creep up to about the 100 level would not
be a surprise to us by the end of the year,” Philips said.
“The knock-on effect domestically cannot be understated.”  The currency depreciated 10 percent against the dollar in
the final quarter of 2012 to 86.75 yen against the dollar and
recently traded at 90.37 per dollar.  Sony, ABC-Mart  The warrant fund, which gained 224 percent in 2009, buys
convertible bonds, sells the fixed-income components of the
securities through asset swaps and keeps the options to convert
the securities into stocks. It returned an estimated 20 percent
this month through Jan. 18, according to a letter to clients.  It bought some of the 150 billion yen ($1.7 billion) of
convertible bonds  sold  by Sony Corp. in mid-November, Philips
said. The notes rose 27 percent by Jan. 23, bolstered by 10
straight weeks of gains in the benchmark Topix  index , the
longest winning streak since 1986, after Abe called for
unlimited monetary easing to end deflation.  The fund also bought some of the 33 billion yen of
convertible bonds issued by  ABC-Mart Inc. (2670) , a Tokyo-based shoe
retailer, earlier this month, Philips said.  Philips expected Abe to draw inspiration from Korekiyo
Takahashi, the Japanese finance minister who was credited for
pulling the nation out of the Great Depression before his
assassination in 1936. Takahashi boosted spending by 34 percent
in the 1932 fiscal year to help end deflation, financing it by
doubling bond issuance, according to a report by the  Japan
Center for Economic Research .  Bank of Japan said on Jan. 22 that it would adopt a 2
percent inflation target and move to open-ended asset purchases
from January 2014, answering calls by Abe to double the
inflation target to help revive the economy.  Northwest was co-founded by former Cresvale International
warrant and convertible bond traders Philips and David Rogers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
