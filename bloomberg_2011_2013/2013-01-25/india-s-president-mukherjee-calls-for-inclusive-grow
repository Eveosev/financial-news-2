India must ensure that the benefits
of economic growth do not become the monopoly of the privileged,
President  Pranab Mukherjee  said in a televised address on the
eve of the nation’s Republic Day.  “The primary purpose of wealth creation must be to drive
out the evil of hunger, deprivation and marginal subsistence
from the base of our expanding population,” Mukherjee said
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
