Mineral Resources Ltd. (MIN)  fell the most
in almost three months in Sydney after the Australian Financial
Review reported  Gina Rinehart ’s Hancock Prospecting Pty sold its
stake in the mining services company.  Mineral Resources  dropped 3.1 percent, its biggest decline
since Nov. 1, to A$10.01 at the close of trading. The benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.5 percent.  Hancock, the iron ore producer owned by Australia’s richest
woman, sold its stake in Mineral Resources for A$150 million
($157 million), the newspaper reported, without saying where it
got the information.  As many as 14.9 million Mineral Resources shares, or about
8 percent of its total outstanding stock, exchanged hands at
A$10 apiece at 11:58 a.m. Sydney time, valuing the transaction
at almost A$150 million, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
