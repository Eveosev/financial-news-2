Tyson Chandler  of the  New York 
Knicks and  Tim Duncan  of the  San Antonio Spurs  were among 14
players selected by coaches as reserves for the National
Basketball Association All-Star Game.  The 62nd NBA All-Star Game will be played at the Toyota
Center in Houston on Feb. 17.  Duncan was selected to play for the 14th time, trailing
 Kobe Bryant  of the  Los Angeles Lakers  and  Kevin Garnett  of the
Boston Celtics, both of whom were picked for the 15th time.  Chandler is one of five first-time All-Star reserves on the
East team, along with  Paul George  of the Indiana Pacers,  Jrue Holiday  of the Philadelphia 76ers, Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland
Cavaliers and Joakim Noah of the Chicago Bulls. Chicago’s Luol Deng makes his second appearance and  Chris Bosh  of the Miami
Heat makes his eighth to complete the East reserves’ roster.  Duncan will play on the West team with LaMarcus Aldridge of
the Portland Trail Blazers, first-timer  James Harden  of the
Houston Rockets, David Lee of the Golden State Warriors,  Tony Parker  of the Spurs,  Zach Randolph  of the Memphis Grizzlies and
 Russell Westbrook  of the Oklahoma City Thunder.  The East and West All-Star coaches and coaching staffs will
come from the teams with the best record in each conference
through games played Feb. 3. The starters were announced Jan. 17
after being chosen in fan voting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
