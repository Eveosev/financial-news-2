Robusta coffee fell for a second day
in London as bean stockpiles climbed and shipments from top
producer  Vietnam  continued to gain. Sugar and cocoa retreated.  Robusta coffee inventories with a valid grading certificate
in warehouses monitored by NYSE Liffe rose 0.6 percent as of
Jan. 21 from two weeks earlier, according to the exchange.
Traders had expected a “small draw,” broker Sucden Financial
Ltd. in London said in a report e-mailed yesterday. Coffee
exports from Vietnam may climb 71 percent in January from a year
earlier, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
estimated.  “Producers in Vietnam are struggling to keep product off
the market,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup
Inc. in  Chicago , wrote in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Robusta coffee for March delivery was down 0.7 percent at
$1,932 a ton by 10:33 a.m. in  London . Arabica coffee for March
delivery was 0.4 percent higher at $1.472 a pound on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York, after dropping 2.6 percent yesterday.  Robusta coffee stockpiles were 105,530 tons on Jan. 21,
exchange data yesterday showed. Coffee shipments from Vietnam
may to rise to 191,000 tons, the ministry said.  Coffee output in Central America and  Mexico  may tumble as a
disease affecting foliage spreads. Guatemala, the region’s
second-biggest grower, may lose a third of its crop because of
leaf rust, President Otto Perez Molina said yesterday in Davos,
Switzerland. The crop in Costa Rica may be 30 percent to 40
percent smaller because of the fungus, President Laura
Chinchilla said in a separate interview.  Brazil Crop  “Expectation of a high coffee crop in Brazil outweighs
production losses in Central America,”  Carsten Fritsch , an
analyst at Commerzbank AG in  Frankfurt , said in a report e-
mailed today. Still, the fungus infestation “should put paid to
any further price slide.”  Cocoa for March delivery was down 0.2 percent at 1,435
pounds ($2,264) a ton on NYSE Liffe. Cocoa for March delivery
lost 0.3 percent to $2,189 a ton on ICE.  Global cocoa stockpiles probably increased by 138,000 tons
to 1.838 million tons in the last marketing year, according to
two people familiar with a preliminary estimate the
International Cocoa Organization will present at a meeting
today.  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery fell 0.3
percent to $485.80 a ton in London. Raw sugar for March delivery
was 0.7 percent down at 18.37 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
