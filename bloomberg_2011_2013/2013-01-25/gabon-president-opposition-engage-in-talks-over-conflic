Gabon’s President Ali-Ben Bongo Ondimba and majority and minority political groups have started
talks amid opposition accusations that the results of the 2009
presidential election were falsified.  The groups are meeting with the president “to discuss
Gabon’s deteriorating political and economic situation,” the
office of the president said in a statement today in Libreville,
the capital.  The meeting will allow for a discussion on the
implementation of “biometrics” in the electoral system, around
which the dispute revolves, and its application for pending
elections and a revision of the electoral roll among other
issues, according to the statement.  Gabon’s political opposition has alleged that Bongo wasn’t
properly elected, doesn’t want to reduce spending and isn’t
involved enough in tackling corruption. There is no obvious
challenger to his position inside or outside the ruling Parti
Democratique Gabonais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
