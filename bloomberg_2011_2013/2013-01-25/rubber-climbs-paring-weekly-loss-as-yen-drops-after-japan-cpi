Rubber advanced after data showed
 Japan ’s consumer prices declined for the sixth time in seven
months, sending the yen to a 2-1/2 year low against the dollar
and raising the appeal of yen-based contracts.  The contract for delivery in June gained as much as 1.3
percent to 311.4 yen a kilogram ($3,444 a metric ton) and was at
309.3 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange at 10:25 a.m. Rubber
has fallen 2.2 percent this week, the first drop in eight weeks.  Japan’s  consumer prices  fell 0.2 percent in December from a
year earlier, the statistics bureau said in Tokyo today. The
 Bank of Japan  may face increasing pressure to add more stimulus
as it remains distant from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s goal of
ending deflation.  “The data raised speculation the BOJ will take additional
measures for the 2 percent inflation target, leading to a
further decline in the yen,”  Kazuhiko Saito , an analyst at
broker Fujitomi Co. in Tokyo, said by phone today. “The yen’s
downtrend will keep providing support to futures in Tokyo.”  The yen slumped to 90.69 per dollar, the lowest level since
June 2010. The dollar also gained after data showed U.S. jobless
claims unexpectedly fell and an index of leading economic
indicators increased, signaling the world’s largest economy
continues to expand.  Rubber for delivery in May added 0.3 percent to 25,710  yuan 
($4,133) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai rubber
free-on-board lost 1 percent to 97.55 baht ($3.27) a kilogram
yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
