Heating oil fell for the first time
in seven days after U.S. inventories rose and forecasters
predicted temperatures in the East may climb next week, reducing
heating fuel demand.  Futures slid 1 percent as U.S.  distillate stockpiles  rose
508,000 barrels last week to 132.9 million, the highest level
since March 30, according to Energy Information Administration
data released yesterday. Temperatures may be near 50 degrees
Fahrenheit (10 Celsius) in  New York  next week, according to MDA
Weather Services of Gaithersburg,  Maryland .  “We’re seeing temperatures start to moderate and supplies
are more than ample,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at
Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  Heating oil for February delivery declined 2.96 cents to
settle at $3.0568 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Volume was 1.5 percent above the 100-day average at 3:10 p.m.  Prices rose 0.1 percent this week. The more actively traded
March contract fell 2.75 cents to $3.0489. February gasoline and
heating oil contracts expire at the close of floor trading Jan.
31.  After a brief respite next week, temperatures probably will
remain at least 3 to 5 degrees below normal through much of the
Northeast or return to seasonal levels from the current deep
freeze until Feb. 8, MDA said.  Gasoil Weakens  Heating oil also fell as gasoil weakened in  Europe ,
indicating less demand for distillate exports from the U.S. at a
time when inventories are rising.  “Gasoil in Europe has come down and gasoil has been quite
strongly correlated with heating oil,” said Amrita Sen, chief
oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research
consulting company in  London .  The February gasoil contract slipped $7.50 to settle at
$968.50 a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
London.  Diesel shipments to Europe from the U.S. Gulf Coast are
poised to decline to a five-week low, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Traders and oil companies booked four tankers to load the
fuel during the two weeks ending Feb. 7 and probably will
charter four more, according to the median estimate in a survey
yesterday of six shipbrokers who specialize in the trade. The
total number of vessels is five fewer than last week and would
be the smallest since Dec. 21.  Gasoline for February delivery gained 1.25 cents to $2.8754
a gallon on the Nymex, the highest settlement since Oct. 12.
Futures rose 2.8 percent this week. Volume was 2.6 percent below
the 100-day average. March gasoline gained 1.31 cents to $2.8898
a gallon.  Gasoline Inventories  Gasoline supplies declined 1.74 million barrels to 233.3
million last week, the first drop in nine weeks, according to
Energy Information Administration data. Between now and May, an
average 1.5 million barrels a day of U.S. refinery capacity will
be shut, according to Sen.  “Gasoline is just supported by planned refinery
maintenance happening across the U.S. in addition to a number of
refinery issues that have impacted inventories,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  The  retail price  for regular gasoline, averaged nationwide,
rose 1 cent to $3.331 a gallon, AAA said today on its website.
Prices are the highest since Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
