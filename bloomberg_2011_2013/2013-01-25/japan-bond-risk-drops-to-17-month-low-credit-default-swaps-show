The cost of insuring corporate bonds
in  Japan  from non-payment fell to a 17-month low, according to
credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased five basis points
to 134.5 basis points as of 9:19 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Deutsche Bank AG prices. The measure is on course for its lowest
close since August 2011, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell one basis point to 109 as of 8:21
a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices show.
The benchmark has ranged from 102.8 to 110.1 this year,
according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index increased one basis point
to 116 as of 10:36 a.m. in Sydney, according to Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices. The gauge has fallen 11 basis
points this year after a 53 basis-point drop in 2012, according
to CMA prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
