Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican
vice-presidential candidate and former Alaska governor, is
leaving as a contributor to  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Fox News Channel.  “We have thoroughly enjoyed our association with Governor
Palin,” Bill Shine, Fox News Channel’s executive vice president
of programming, said today in a statement. “We wish her the
best in her future endeavors.”  The most-watched U.S. news channel is tinkering with its
lineup of contributors after the November re-election of
President  Barack Obama . The network hired former Democratic
Congressman and presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich this
month and re-signed Karl Rove, former top adviser to President
George W. Bush.  New York-based News Corp., controlled by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch, gained 0.6 percent to $27.21
at the close in New York. The Class A stock climbed 43 percent
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
