Japan  will set its targets for
cutting greenhouse gas emissions by November after reviewing the
current 25 percent reduction goal that the government has said
is out of reach.  The timetable was announced today by Minister of the
Environment Nobuteru Ishihara around the same time as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe said the review will take place. The current
target covers the period from 1990 to 2020.  “We are not able to set precise figures yet, because the
future of nuclear power hasn’t been decided,” Ishihara told
reporters after a cabinet meeting.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga yesterday said the
25 percent cut in emissions is impossible to achieve, public
broadcaster NHK reported. Climate envoys around the world meet
every year to discuss ways to cut emissions of heat-trapping
gases blamed for global warming. This year’s meeting will take
place in  Poland  in November.  Japan’s current emission reduction goal was set by the
 Democratic Party  of Japan, which was ousted from power by the
 Liberal Democratic Party  in December. The DPJ also set a policy
to phase out use of atomic power following the Fukushima nuclear
disaster in March 2011. The LDP has also indicated it will
review that policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
