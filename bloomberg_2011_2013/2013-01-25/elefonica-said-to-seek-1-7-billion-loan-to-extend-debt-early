Telefonica SA (TEF) , Spain’s largest
telephone company, is seeking 1.25 billion euros ($1.7 billion)
of credit lines to extend debt maturing in 2014, according to
five people with knowledge of the transaction.  The deal comprises two 625 million-euro loans maturing in
2017 and 2018, the people said, who asked not to be identified
as the terms are private. Banks have been asked to commit to the
so-called forward-start deals, where financing terms are locked
in before the existing borrowings mature, by the first week of
February, they said.  The Madrid-based company is seeking to partially extend a
two billion-euro loan signed in 2010, the people said. The debt
backed Telefonica’s purchase of a stake in Brazilian mobile
operator Vivo Participacoes SA, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company is offering to boost interest margins on the
drawn portions of the facility maturing 2017 to about 200 basis
points more than the euro interbank offered rate, while the 2018
loan will pay 210 basis points, three of the people said. The
current facility paid initial interest of 65 basis points more
than Euribor, the data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Banks must commit to both facilities and the debt will be
allocated to lenders depending on their share of the existing
loans, two of the people said.  A separate 1 billion-euro credit line maturing in July will
either be repaid or allowed to expire, said the people.  Miguel Angel Garzon, a Madrid-based spokesman at
Telefonica, declined to comment on the financing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
