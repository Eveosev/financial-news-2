Enterprise Product Partners LP (EPD)  said
the Seaway pipeline is “running as expected” despite
restrictions on how much oil can be received at the pipe’s final
terminal in Jones Creek, Texas.  Shippers can take enough oil off the line at Seaway’s other
terminal in Katy, Texas, to “make up the difference,”  Rick Rainey , a Houston-based spokesman for Enterprise, said today.
Rainey declined to specify the rate at which the line is
currently running.  The pipeline’s capacity was expanded to 400,000 barrels a
day on Jan. 11 in an effort to help relieve the glut of crude
oil stored at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures
traded in New York. Jones Creek can only accept 175,000 barrels
a day, Enterprise said in a bulletin to shippers on Jan. 23.  “Rates are flowing as we would have expected with the
additional Katy receipt point that has allowed volumes to
continue normally,” Rainey said. “Flows on the pipeline have
not been restricted.”  There is capacity on Enterprise’s Rancho pipeline for
Seaway volumes taken off at Katy to be delivered into Houston-
area refineries, Rainey said.  Enterprise and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  each own 50 percent of Seaway.
Enterprise operates the pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
