The  yuan  in  Hong Kong  completed the
worst week since June as the People’s Bank of China set the
daily exchange-rate fixing at the lowest level since Jan. 9.  The PBOC cut the  reference rate  by 0.04 percent to 6.2805
per dollar, weakening it for a second day, spurring speculation
the central bank seeks to cap gains as a four-month slide in the
yen makes Japanese exports more competitive in global markets.
The  Bank of Japan (8301)  set a 2 percent inflation target this week,
with a planned 13 trillion yen a month ($143 billion) in
securities purchases on hold until January 2014. A spokesman for
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party said on Jan. 22 that
Japan’s actions risked retaliation by other Group of 20 nations.  “China is taking a cautious stance on the yuan’s rate as
the impact on exports from rapid yen depreciation isn’t clear,”
said  Daniel Chan , executive vice-president at Glory Sky Global
Markets Ltd. in Hong Kong.  The Chinese currency fell 0.13 percent today, extending the
weekly loss to 0.38 percent, to 6.2128 per dollar as of 4:37
p.m. in Hong Kong, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
spot rate fell for a sixth day in the offshore market.  In Shanghai, the yuan dropped 0.08 percent this week to
close at 6.2205 per dollar, according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency, which declined 0.04 percent
today, is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the central bank’s daily fixing.  Lower Rates  One-year interest rate swaps pegged to the three-month
 Shanghai  interbank offered rate fell this week after the PBOC
announced plans to start daily short-term liquidity operations.
Credit Agricole CIB said the so-called SLO will reduce the
interest-rate advantage on the yuan.  “Liquidity concerns have been eased with the central
bank’s injections through reverse repos,” said Chan.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards weakened 0.16 percent
today to 6.2958 per dollar in Hong Kong, a 1.2 percent discount
to the onshore spot rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-
month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, fell 14 basis points, or
0.14 percentage point, this week to 1.26 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Bank of England  is ready “in principle” to agree on a
yuan swap line with the Chinese central bank, which would need a
mutually agreeable format, Chris Salmon, Bank of England’s chief
cashier said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
