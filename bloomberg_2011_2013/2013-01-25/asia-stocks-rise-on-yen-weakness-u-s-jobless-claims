Asian  stocks  rose as declines in
Japanese consumer prices added to the case for more monetary
stimulus, boosting the Topix Index to its longest weekly winning
streak in 40 years. Shares also gained after U.S. jobless claims
fell to a five-year low.  Sony Corp. (6758)  rose 8.5 percent in  Tokyo  on a report it may
sell its lithium battery business.  Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. (KAR) 
gained 14 percent after the explorer said it discovered oil in
 Brazil . Great Eagle Holdings Ltd. added 14 percent after the
real estate company proposed a spin-off of its Hong Kong hotels.
Samsung Electronics Co. dropped 2.5 percent to its lowest close
since Nov. 30 after warning that the South Korean currency’s
strength will hurt future earnings.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 0.3 percent to 131.83 as
of 7:19 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge is headed for a 0.7 percent
loss this week, the biggest decline since November, after a two-
day retreat from the highest close in 17-months on Jan 22. About
three stocks gained for every two that fell.  “Investors are becoming more optimistic about the earnings
prospects for Japanese exporters with the yen weakening so
much,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $20 billion. “Good
economic data out of the U.S., as well as the hope placed in
policy makers’ monetary easing measures,” are boosting shares.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  dropped 0.3
percent to 475.78 as consumer-staple and financial shares
declined in Hong Kong and  China .  Japan’s Streak  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index jumped 10 percent through
yesterday from Nov. 14, when the announcement of elections in
 Japan  spurred a rally on speculation a new government would take
steps to end deflation. Asia’s benchmark equities gauge traded
at 14.2 times average estimated earnings, compared with 13.5 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12.2 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s Topix gained 2.2 percent today, rising for an 11th
 straight week , the longest such winning streak since January
1973. Consumer prices declined for the sixth time in seven
months, highlighting the challenge the  Bank of Japan  faces in
reaching its 2 percent inflation target.  The yen remained weaker after touching a 2 1/2-year low as
BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said he will make “considerable
efforts” to reach the price target. Declines in the currency
boost the earnings outlook for the country’s exporters.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  rose 0.5 percent, advancing
for an eighth day, its longest streak of advances in almost
three years.  Korea Stocks  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.1 percent and China’s
Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.5 percent as losses in consumer
companies and financial stocks outpaced a rise in health care
shares.  South Korea ’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  lost 0.9 percent as Samsung
dropped and Kia Motors Corp. joined larger affiliate Hyundai
Motor Co. in posting falling profits last quarter.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. Most U.S.
stocks rose yesterday as an unexpected drop in jobless claims
and better-than-forecast earnings from Netflix Inc. and Xerox
Corp. offset the worst slump for  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in four years.  Applications for U.S unemployment insurance payments
decreased by 5,000 to 330,000 in the week ended Jan. 19, the
fewest since 2008, the Labor Department said yesterday.
Economists had expected 355,000 claims.  Some 75 percent of the 134 companies in the S&P 500 that
have released results so far exceeded profit projections,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts on average
forecast growth of 3.8 percent in fourth-quarter profit, the
data show.  Brazil Oil  Karoon surged the most in 15 months in Sydney trading,
rising 14 percent to A$6.15 in Sydney after the explorer struck
oil in Brazil’s  Santos Basin . The discovery provides
“confidence in the other prospects within Karoon’s blocks,”
the Mt. Martha, Victoria-based company said today in a
statement.  Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. advanced 12 percent to 1,416
yen in Tokyo after rising as much as 24 percent, the most in 37
years. Shares surged a second day after Japanese national
broadcaster NHK reported the company will apply for clinical
trials on the world’s first drug targeting cancer stem cells.  The company’s fundamentals haven’t changed, said Barclays
Plc analyst Atsushi Seki, who rates the stock underweight.  Great Eagle jumped 14 percent to HK$31.70 in Hong Kong
after saying it submitted a proposal to spin-off its hotel
properties in the city.  Li Ning Fundraising  Among stocks that fell, Li Ning Co., a sportswear company
named after its Olympic gymnast founder, tumbled 15 percent to
HK$5.30 in  Hong Kong  after saying it plans to raise as much as
HK$1.87 billion ($241 million) offering convertible securities
to fund efforts to revive its brand.  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd., a maker of polysilicon and
solar wafers, dropped 7.4 percent to HK$2.14. The shares dropped
after China’s government said it aims to have 21 gigawatts of
solar capacity by 2015. Shanghai Securities News last month
reported China may raise the target to 40 gigawatts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
