Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein is optimistic that the
worst of the financial crisis is over, according to an interview
with the British Broadcasting Corp.  “The moment of crisis is over,” Blankfein told the  BBC .
“I find a lot of things to be optimistic about, including the
worst expected or worrisome problems that everyone talked about
last year are off the table,” he said.  Blankfein, who became CEO in 2006, has overseen the New
York-based firm’s highest profits and biggest losses as a public
company. He also warned about the potential for a credit crisis
during a June 2007 conference, 15 months before the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  “Problems related to the financial crisis have been chewed
through,” he told the BBC. “Net, net I’m optimistic. That is
my predictive self.”  Blankfein said the firm’s deliberations over whether to
defer the payment of incentive compensation due to U.K.
employees until after the top rate of income tax drops April
weren’t linked to “ tax evasion  or  tax avoidance .”  Goldman Sachs won’t delay its distribution of U.K. bonuses
to help minimize employees’ tax rates, a person with direct
knowledge of the decision said earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
