King Abdullah of Jordan urged the
resumption of negotiations between Israel and Palestinians on a
two-state solution and said the two sides need to reach a deal
before the end of U.S. President  Barack Obama ’s term.  “There is no time left for Israel to play the waiting
game,” Abdullah said in Davos, Switzerland at the World
Economic Forum today. “The two-state solution will only survive
as long as the end of President Obama’s term. Beyond that, if we
don’t fix it in the next four years, I don’t believe it will
ever happen.”  Talks between Israel and the Palestinians fell apart in
September 2010 after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
didn’t extend a 10-month building freeze in the West Bank.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said he won’t
restart talks until construction is halted.  Jordan’s king has told Israeli leaders that they must stop
building settlements in the West Bank and “refrain from any
measures that could change the features of Jerusalem” or affect
Islamic or Christian holy sites.  To contact the reporter on this story:
