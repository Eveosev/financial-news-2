Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton 
is wearing glasses rather than her  contact lenses  because of
“lingering issues stemming from her concussion,” according to
a spokesman, Philippe Reines.  “With them on she sees just fine,” Reines, deputy
assistant secretary of state for public affairs, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The  New York  Daily News  reported  yesterday that Clinton’s
glasses have an adhesive Fresnel prism, which the newspaper said
is usually used to bring objects into focus for those with
double vision or muscle weakness in the eye.  Reines didn’t comment on the nature of the “lingering
issues” that will require Clinton to wear the glasses “for a
period of time.”  Clinton, 65, has been wearing glasses since returning to
work on Jan. 7 after a series of ailments kept her away for a
month. Clinton came down with a stomach virus that led to
dehydration, causing her to faint and sustain a concussion,
according to the department. She was later hospitalized to treat
a blood clot between her brain and skull.  To contact the reporter on this story:
