Vitol Group sold two cargoes of
Russian Urals crude. Total SA bid unsuccessfully for  North Sea 
Forties grade for a fifth day at a lower premium than yesterday.  The North Sea Buzzard oil field will shut for a week of
scheduled maintenance in March, according to a person with
direct knowledge of the matter.  North Sea  Total sought to buy Forties at 65 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent for loading Feb. 9 to Feb. 11, a Bloomberg survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.
That’s 10 cents lower than its equivalent bid yesterday and
compares with purchases it made on Jan. 22 at premiums of 35
cents and 40 cents.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose 4 cents to 77 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the most since
Jan. 11.  Brent for March settlement traded at $113.04 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $113.57 in the previous session. The April
contract was at $111.94, a discount of $1.10 to March.  The Buzzard field will close for the first week of March,
the person said, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential. Patti Lewis, a Calgary-based
spokeswoman for the operator Nexen Inc., declined to comment
when contacted by e-mail today.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals for loading in
February to Gunvor Group Ltd. at a 90 cent discount to Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the Platts survey
showed. That’s the same level as the Jan. 21 trade.  OAO Lukoil’s Litasco offered the same volume at a 80 cent
discount to the benchmark, without finding a buyer, according to
the survey.  In the Mediterranean, Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 80,000
tons of Urals crude from Vitol at 40 cents less than Dated Brent
on a delivered basis to Augusta,  Italy , the survey showed.
That’s the first deal in more than seven weeks and compares with
a Dec. 13 trade at a 25 cent discount.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened by 9 cents a barrel to minus 20 cents, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the  discount 
increased to $1 a barrel from 74 cents yesterday, which was the
smallest spread since Nov. 6, the data showed.  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s largest oil company, bought 100,000
tons of Urals from Statoil ASA via an informal closed tender,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  Orlen purchased the blend for loading from either Ust-Luga
or Primorsk ports on the  Baltic Sea  during Feb. 7 to Feb. 11,
the people said, asking not to be identified because the
information is confidential.  Russia plans to reduce crude exports from the Baltic and
 Black Sea  in February, led by a 12 percent drop from Primorsk, a
preliminary loading program obtained by Bloomberg shows.  A total of 4.3 million tons, or 1.13 million barrels a day,
of Urals will be shipped from the port of Primorsk, according to
the schedule. That compares with 1.28 million barrels a day in
January.  Ust-Luga on the Baltic Sea will export 13 Urals lots of
100,000 tons each, or 340,000 barrels a day, down 10 percent
from planned daily shipments this month. Novorossiysk will load
a total of 2.76 million tons of crude, or 722,000 barrels a day,
a 5.6 percent decrease from January.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell 2 cents to $2.07 a
barrel more than Dated Brent, Bloomberg data show. That’s the
least since Dec. 4.  Indian Oil Corp., the nation’s largest refiner, issued a
tender to buy crude for March loading, a document obtained by
 Bloomberg News  shows.  The tender, which was released today, closes at 3 p.m.
local time on Jan. 30 with offers valid until 5 p.m. the next
day, according to the document.  The company previously bought 1 million barrels of Murban
crude as well as four million barrels of West African grade for
March loading.  The Republic of Congo is set to increase exports of Djeno
crude in March to six lots, one more than next month, according
to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  Each consignment will be 920,000 barrels. No N’Kossa grade
cargoes are set to be shipped in March, compared with two in
February, a separate loading program showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
