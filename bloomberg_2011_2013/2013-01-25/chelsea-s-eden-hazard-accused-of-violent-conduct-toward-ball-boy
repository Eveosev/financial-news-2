England’s Football Association has
accused Chelsea midfielder Eden Hazard of using violent conduct
following an incident with a ball boy at Swansea.  Hazard received a red card in the 78th minute of the League
Cup semifinal on Jan. 23 for kicking at the ball boy who
wouldn’t give the ball back. The boy fell on the ball as Hazard
tried to retrieve it, with the Belgian then trying to kick it
from under the teenager.  The F.A. said in a statement on its website that Hazard’s
behavior “constituted violent conduct whereby the standard
punishment that would otherwise apply was clearly
insufficient.”  Hazard, who received an automatic three-match suspension
for the red card, has until 6 p.m. U.K. time on Jan. 29 to
respond to the F.A.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
