Former  New York  Yankees pitcher Carl Pavano ruptured his spleen while shoveling snow off the
driveway at his Vermont home, Fox Sports reported, citing a
person it didn’t identify.  Pavano, 37, a free agent who played for the  Minnesota Twins 
for the past four seasons, slipped and fell, causing the injury,
Fox said.  He was with the Yankees from 2005-08, winning a total of
nine games after signing a four-year, $40 million contract. He
suffered injuries to his arm, shoulder, back, ribs and buttocks
during that time. He hasn’t pitched since June, when he injured
his shoulder.  Fox reported that the spleen injury will sideline him for
6-8 weeks. He is 108-107 for his career, and went 18-8 with a
3.00 earned run average for the  Florida Marlins  the year before
the Yankees signed him.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
