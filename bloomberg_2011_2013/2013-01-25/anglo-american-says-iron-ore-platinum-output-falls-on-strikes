Anglo American Plc (AAL) , a mining company
with operations from  Australia  to  Brazil , said fourth-quarter
iron-ore and platinum output declined because of strikes in
 South Africa , while coal and copper production rose.  Output at Anglo’s Kumba Iron Ore unit fell 19 percent to 9
million metric tons, mainly because of a walkout at the Sishen
mine, the company said today in a statement. Equivalent refined
platinum, which is smelted from mined ore and purchased metal-
in-concentrate, declined 29 percent to 416,000 ounces following
stoppages at the Rustenburg, Amandelbult and Union projects.  Pay strikes that began at South Africa’s platinum mines in
August spread to gold, coal and iron-ore operations, with about
120,000 workers downing tools at the peak of the unrest,
according to the Chamber of Mines. Anglo has announced plans to
cut platinum volumes equal to almost 7 percent of world output
and may fire as many as 14,000 workers to curb costs.  Copper production climbed 2 percent to 172,900 tons in the
fourth quarter. Export metallurgical coal increased 13 percent
to 4.6 million tons.  De Beers , the diamond producer owned by
Anglo American, raised output by 24 percent to 8.05 million
carats, according to the statement.  Copper results beat analyst estimates after the company
increased output from its Los Bronces mine in Chile, Johann Pretorius, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Johannesburg, said
today in a note. Production exceeded Citigroup’s projection by
12 percent, he said.  Anglo dropped 0.5 percent to close at 1,886 pence in London
trading.  Nickel output declined 25 percent to 7,400 tons because of
a mining halt at the Loma de Niquel project in  Venezuela  after
the country banned exports and mining concessions expired in
November, according to London-based Anglo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
