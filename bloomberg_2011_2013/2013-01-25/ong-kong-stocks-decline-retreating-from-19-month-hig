Hong Kong   stocks  declined for a
third day, with the city’s benchmark index retreating after
reaching the highest level since May 2011 this week.  China Minsheng Banking Corp., the nation’s first privately
owned lender, dropped 2.2 percent after closing at a record high
yesterday. Li Ning Co. slumped 14 percent after the Chinese
sportswear company said it plans to raise as much as HK$1.87
billion ($241 million) offering convertible securities. China
Rongsheng Heavy Industries Group Holdings Ltd. dropped 5 percent
after billionaire co-founder Zhang Zhirong gave up his
controlling stake in the shipbuilder.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  slipped 0.4 percent to 23,506.29 as of
the midday break in Hong Kong, with about two shares falling for
each that rose. The gauge is heading for a fifth month of
advance, the longest streak of monthly gains since July 2009,
amid optimism  China’s economy  will continue to recover.  “The market has accumulated very strong gains in the past
few months so now its due for consolidation,” said  Ben Kwong ,
chief operating officer at KGI Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.
“Investors will probably buy shares on weakness. With the
steady improvement in the economy, the earnings will also
improve accordingly.”  The city’s benchmark index is poised for a 0.4 percent
decline this week. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies dropped 1.3 percent to 11,938.27.  The  Hang Seng Volatility Index (VHSI)  fell 3.5 percent this week
to 12.64, indicating options traders expect a swing of 3.6
percent in the next 30 days. That’s the lowest since August
2005. Futures on the Hang Seng Index fell 0.3 percent to 23,540.  To contact the reporter on this story:
