Treasury 10-year note  yields  may
advance to a nine-month high of 2 percent after failing to drop
below a key technical level, Credit Suisse Group AG said, citing
trading patterns.  A resistance level of 1.8 percent held yesterday, and the
yield on the benchmark note increased to 1.91 percent. It now
may rise further, according to Christopher Hine, vice president
of  technical analysis  at Credit Suisse Securities.  “We are look for 10-year bonds to push on to test 1.97
next and eventually to test better support at 2 to 2.02,”
London-based Hine said via e-mail.  The 10-year yield  increased  seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 1.92 percent at 10:26 a.m. in New York
after reaching 1.8039 percent yesterday. The yield last touched
2 percent on April 25.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Resistance is an area on a price
graph where technical analysts anticipate sell orders to be
