German stocks  advanced to a five-
year high as business confidence rose more than forecast in
January, and European Central Bank data showed banks will repay
more long-term refinancing operation loans than estimated.  Bayer AG (BAYN)  rose to a record after Bank of America Merrill
Lynch put the German drugs and chemicals maker on its list of
top European stocks.  K+S AG (SDF)  dropped as Morgan Stanley downgraded
the shares.  SolarWorld AG (SWV)  slid 30 percent after saying it will
restructure its finances to remain a going concern.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  climbed 1.4 percent to 7,857.97 at the close
of trading in Frankfurt, its highest level since January 2008.
The benchmark gained 2 percent this week, and has risen 3.2
percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a budget
and American companies reported better-than-expected earnings.
The broader HDAX Index added 1.3 percent today.  “This is a good signal that banks are able to refinance
themselves, a further sign that the banking crisis is
diminishing,” Robert Halver, head of capital markets research
at Baader Bank AG in Frankfurt, said in a telephone interview.
“The big threat of 2013 was the economy, and the picture is
stabilizing. I spoke with some asset managers today who were
talking about buying equities.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the equity benchmark was 0.8 percent lower than the average of
the last 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Business Confidence  The Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 104.2 in January, from
102.4 the previous month. That’s the third month of gains and
the highest reading since June. Sentiment fell to a 2 1/2 year
low in October. Economists predicted a gain to 103, according to
the median of 41 forecasts in a  Bloomberg News survey .  Some 278 financial institutions will return 137.2 billion
euros ($184.4 billion) on Jan. 30, the Frankfurt-based ECB said
in a statement today. That compares with the median forecast of
84 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The
ECB’s first three-year loan totalled 489 billion euros and banks
can continue to make early repayments in coming weeks.  Bayer added 4.8 percent to 75.92 euros, its highest price
in more than 20 years.  “Strong execution” as Germany’s largest drugmaker begins
to sell new medicines this year will probably boost investors’
confidence that it will get more than 5.5 billion euros in
annual sales from the drug introductions, Sachin Jain and Graham Parry, London-based analysts at Merrill Lynch, wrote in a note
to investors today. Average analyst expectations are for 3
billion euros in 2016 sales from new drugs, they wrote.  BASF, Henkel  BASF SE (BAS) , the world’s biggest chemical manufacturer,
advanced 2.5 percent to 75.60 euros.  Henkel AG, the Dusseldorf-based maker of Persil detergent,
gained 2.4 percent to 65.26 euros, its highest level since at
least August 1992.  A gauge of chemical makers increased the most among the 19
industry groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   K+S AG, Europe’s biggest potash distributor, lost 0.6
percent to 34.45 euros, after earlier falling as much as 2.4
percent. Morgan Stanley cut the stock to underweight, a rating
similar to sell, from equal weight.  SolarWorld slumped 30 percent to 1.11 euros, for its
biggest drop since at least 1999. Germany’s biggest solar-panel
maker said management plans financial restructuring to remain a
going concern in what it called an “anticompetitive” market.  “Management is of the opinion that serious adjustments on
the debt side are necessary, in particular with regard to the
bonds and the assignable bank loans,” the Bonn-based company
said late yesterday in a statement.  Salzgitter AG, the country’s second-biggest steelmaker,
lost 3 percent to 35.73 euros as UBS AG downgraded the stock to
sell. An unrealistic margin recovery has been priced into the
shares, and the risk to 2013 earnings merits a 58 percent cut in
UBS’s pretax profit estimate to 53 million euros, according to
analyst Carsten Riek.  To contact the reporter on this story:
