South African corn futures dropped
for a third day after the rand strengthened the most in almost a
month against the dollar, reducing the cost of imports and
cutting demand for locally produced grain.  White corn for March delivery, the most active contract,
dropped 0.6 percent to 2,165 rand ($241) a metric ton by the
close in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for delivery in July
declined 0.9 percent to 2,076 rand a ton.  The rand strengthened as much as 0.8 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Dec. 27, to 8.9757 a dollar after
depreciating to a four-year low on Jan. 23.  “There was a bit of a rand strength and that took prices
down,” Andrew Fletcher, an independent trader, said by phone
from Kroonstad in the Free State province.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain. Meal made from white corn, which is also called maize, is
one of the country’s staple foods, while the yellow variety is
mainly used as  animal feed .  Wheat for delivery in March decreased 1.2 percent to
3,635.20 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
