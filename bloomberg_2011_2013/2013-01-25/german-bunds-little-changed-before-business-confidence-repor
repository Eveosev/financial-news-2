German  two-year  note yields climbed
to the  highest  in 10 months as banks’ plans to repay European
Central Bank loans added to signs the debt crisis is abating and
damped demand for the region’s safest fixed-income assets.  Benchmark 10-year bund  yields  advanced to a three-month
high. Austrian, Belgian, Dutch and  French two-year notes  slid
after the Frankfurt-based central bank said 278 banks will hand
back 137.2 billion euros ($184.7 billion) next week, the first
opportunity for early repayment. That compares with the median
forecast of 84 billion euros in a Bloomberg News survey. Italian
10-year yields fell to the lowest level since November 2010
after data showed German business confidence rose this month.  “The number is higher than expected, and it shows that
banks are quite comfortable in terms of offloading excess
liquidity,” said  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-market debt
strategy at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam. “This goes along with the
theme of a reduction in the flight to safety,” which should
pressure German bunds, he said.  Germany ’s two-year yields jumped eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 0.26 percent at 4:19 p.m.  London  time,
after reaching 0.28 percent, the highest since March 22. The
rate increased as much as 10 basis points, the most since Nov.
16, 2011. The zero percent securities maturing in December 2014
fell 0.15, or 1.50 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 99.52.  The 10-year bund yield advanced six basis points to 1.64
percent after climbing to 1.65 percent, the  highest  level since
Oct. 18.  Avert Crunch  The Frankfurt-based central bank flooded financial markets
with two tranches of three-year loans, or so-called Longer-Term
Refinancing Operations, a year ago to avert a credit crunch
after banks stopped lending because of  Europe ’s sovereign-debt
crisis. About 150 billion euros of the first installment, which
totaled 489 billion euros, will be given back early as banks
continue to repay the funds over coming weeks, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  “Amid fading tensions in the euro crisis, the ECB is
taking back some of the extra liquidity it injected into the
banking system,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at
Berenberg Bank AG in London, wrote in a note to clients. “The
unwinding of the ECB’s non-standard support to the financial
system has started.”  The first opportunity for financial institutions to return
money from the second tranche, which amounted to 529 billion
euros, is Feb. 27.  Futures traders increased bets that interbank borrowing
costs will rise after the ECB’s announcement.  Yield Climbs  The implied yield on the three-month Euribor futures
contract expiring in December 2013 climbed as much as 17 basis
points to 0.595 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price dropped to the lowest since July 3.  Three-month Euribor, the rate at which European banks say
they see each other lending in euros, was at 0.214 percent
today, according to data from the European Banking Federation.
That’s the highest since Oct. 8.  “Following today’s announcement, the liquidity surplus
should decline to 446 billion euros starting from next
Wednesday,” London-based Barclays Plc strategists Laurent Fransolet and Giuseppe Maraffino wrote in a note to clients
today. The market “is starting to price in the possibility of a
repayment that could bring the liquidity surplus below 200
billion euros, with tightening of liquidity conditions.”  The yield on  France ’s two-year notes climbed seven basis
points to 0.29 percent. The rate on similar-maturity Austrian
securities rose six basis points to 0.27 percent. Dutch two-year
yields advanced 10 basis points to 0.35 percent, while  Belgium ’s
two-year rate increased nine basis points to 0.46 percent.  Business Confidence  The Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 104.2 from 102.4 in
December. That’s the highest since June and the third straight
gain. Sentiment dropped to a 2 1/2-year low in October.
Economists predicted an increase to 103, according to the median
of 41 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Ten-year  Italian yields  dropped three basis points to 4.13
percent after reaching 4.07 percent, the lowest level since Nov.
10, 2010. Spanish 10-year yields fell 12 basis points to 5.13
percent.  Volatility on Belgian bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of  Finland  and the Netherlands,
according to measures of 10-year or similar-maturity debt, the
yield spread between two-year and 10-year securities, and
credit-default swaps.  German government bonds have handed investors a loss of 1.3
percent this month through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Spanish debt gained 1.8 percent and that of
 Italy  rose 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
