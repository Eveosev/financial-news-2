As the Revolutionary War was heating
up in 1775, the rebels in New England faced an acute shortage of
weapons and gunpowder.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  There were ancient muskets and some old cannon in
provincial arsenals. And powder stocks were depleted through
use, spoilage and British curbs on war materiel.  New Hampshire  had only four ounces of powder for each
militiaman and muskets for just one in four.  In August, George Washington was leading the army besieging
Boston. When told that the main magazine in Cambridge held 38
barrels of gunpowder -- not the 300 he was led to expect -- he
was so appalled he couldn’t speak for half an hour.  Two days later, he wrote to  John Hancock  that total
supplies in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and
Connecticut added up to nine cartridges per man.  I spoke with Kevin Phillips, author of “1775: A Good Year
for Revolution,” on the following topics:  1. Military Fervor  2. Boston Tea Party  3. Arms Race  4. Propaganda Machine  5. Unsung Heroes  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
