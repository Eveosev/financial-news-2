Kenya ’s shilling headed for its
lowest level in a year as an increase in demand for dollars from
companies coincided with a fall in inflows from key export
sectors.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy weakened less
than 0.1 percent to 87.45 a dollar by 12:31 p.m. in Nairobi, its
lowest level on a closing basis since Jan. 4, 2012. The shilling
has depreciated 1.6 percent this year, compared with a 1.8
percent drop in Tanzania’s shilling and a 6.3 percent loss for
 South Africa ’s rand, the continent’s worst performer.  “Kenya’s shilling weakened due to heavy demand for dollars
from importers amid reduced inflows from agriculture, tourism
and diaspora remittances,” Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB)  said in
a note today.  The shilling will probably weaken further over the next
five weeks as businesses accumulate dollars on concern March 4
elections may spark violence, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of traders and analysts. The vote will be the first since
a disputed 2007 poll sparked two months of clashes in which more
than 1,100 people died.  The Kenyan shilling may weaken 1.7 percent to 89 a dollar,
the survey of eight analysts and traders on Jan. 23 showed. The
median forecast was 88 a dollar by voting day.  The currency lost 9.9 percent between the vote on Dec. 27,
2007, and Feb. 27, 2008, the day before an accord to end the
violence was signed, according to data compiled by Bloomberg  The central bank has sold dollars each day since Jan. 18,
to support the shilling, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Tanzania’s shilling depreciated 0.2 percent to 1,613 per
dollar, retreating for a second day. The Ugandan shilling was
unchanged at 2,675 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
