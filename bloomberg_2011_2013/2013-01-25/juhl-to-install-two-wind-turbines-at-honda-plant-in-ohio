Juhl Energy Inc., a U.S. renewable
energy developer, plans to install, own and operate two wind
turbines at a Honda Motor Co. transmission factory in  Ohio .  The 2-megawatt turbines may cost a total of $8 million and
begin operating before next year, Yusef Orest, project developer
for Pipestone, Minnesota-based Juhl, said in a phone interview
today.  The turbines will provide about 10 percent of the
electricity at its facility in Russells Point, according to an
e-mailed statement today from Toyko-based Honda.  The turbine supplier and financing havenâ€™t been finalized
yet, Orest said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
