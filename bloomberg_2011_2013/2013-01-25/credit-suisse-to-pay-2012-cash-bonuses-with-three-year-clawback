Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
 Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank, plans to pay out part of its
bonuses for top staff at the investment bank in cash that can be
clawed back over the next three years.  The compensation, called cash retention awards, will be
given to directors and managing directors in the investment
bank, the Zurich-based company informed employees in an internal
memo this week. A Credit Suisse official confirmed details of
the awards.  Credit Suisse used similar instruments to pay parts of
bonuses of top investment bankers for 2008 and 2010, according
to the company’s annual reports. Employees will also be eligible
for deferred stock awards, some of which can be clawed back, and
an asset-based instrument called Plus Bond as part of their 2012
variable compensation, according to the bank.  Cash retention awards will be paid out in full this year
and can be reclaimed if, for example, an employee leaves the
company or engages in detrimental conduct. The company can
reclaim the full amount of the awards, reduced by 1/36 for every
completed month from the date of the grant to the event
triggering repayment, according to the memo.  Plus Bond awards are based on a trading portfolio of
structured product securities, have a maturity of 3 1/2 years
and will pay an annual coupon, according to Credit Suisse. While
the instrument will make up part of bonuses for the top
investment bankers, other employees can elect to receive it as
well instead of share awards.  To contact the reporters on this story:
