Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. (KAR) , an
explorer with oil blocks in  South America , is looking to
complete the sale of a stake in its assets in  Peru  in mid-2013
and is set to allow potential partners access to the data.  “We do have multiple interested parties, and we think
we’ll end up with at least one of those,” Scott Hosking, chief
financial officer of Mt. Martha, Victoria-based Karoon, said
today in a phone interview. “That data room will open soon.”  Karoon is developing oil blocks off Peru and Brazil after
scrapping a proposed initial public offering of its South
American business in November 2010. The holdings in Peru’s
Tumbes Basin may hold as much as 1.92 billion barrels of oil,
according to Karoon’s estimates in a  December presentation .  The company expects to have “an offer and be negotiating
the final joint venture agreements” in the middle of the year
for the Peruvian assets, Hosking said. Karoon plans to begin
drilling in Peru at the end of 2013, he said.  Karoon said today that it found oil at the Kangaroo-1
exploration well in Brazil’s  Santos Basin , driving the shares to
the highest in eight months in Sydney trading.  The shares  were
13 percent higher at A$6.11 as of 1:37 p.m. local time.  Colombia’s  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE)  agreed in
September to buy a 35 percent stake in Karoon’s Brazilian
holdings, paying $40 million in cash and funding as much as $210
million in exploration costs. The company said in September that
it expected to complete a partnership deal in Peru in the first
quarter of 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
