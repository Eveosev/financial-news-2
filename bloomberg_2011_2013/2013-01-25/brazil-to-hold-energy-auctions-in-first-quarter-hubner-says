Brazil  will hold an electricity
auction in the first quarter to assure distribution companies
have enough energy to meet their contracts without having to
make spot market purchases, the head of electric regulator said.  Distribution companies will have the possibility of buying
more than 2,000 megawatts that are available after over 2,000
megawatts that aren’t available anymore due to power utilities
such as  Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais (CMIG4)  and
Cia Energetica de Sao Paulo refused the government’s proposal to
extend their concessions in 2012, Nelson Hubner, head of the
regulator known as Aneel told reporters in Brasilia.  Brazil’s government is also discussing the possibility of
creating credit lines for distributors at the country’s
development bank, known as BNDES. The credit lines would provide
 cash flow  for utilities while the country uses more expensive
thermal plants because of lower water reservoirs, Hubner said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
