Halliburton Co. (HAL) , the biggest
hydraulic-fracturing services provider, deployed its first
bacteria-fighting truck in Australia to clean fracking waters
and reduce the environmental impact of drilling for natural-gas.  The world’s second-largest oilfield services provider helps
companies drill and complete wells using the pressure-pumping
technique known as fracking, which blasts water mixed with sand
and chemicals underground to free trapped hydrocarbons from
shale formations.  Halliburton’s “ CleanStream ” unit, which was introduced
about two years ago in the U.S., uses ultra-violet light instead
of the more conventional biocides to kill bacteria in the
fracking fluid. The company has paired the technology at some
wells with a recycling process called “CleanWave” that uses an
electrical charge to separate the contaminants and clean the
water.  The CleanStream unit was “successfully” used during the
fourth quarter for the first time in the Cooper basin of
 Australia , Chief Operating Officer Jeff Miller told analysts and
investors today on the company’s earnings conference call.
