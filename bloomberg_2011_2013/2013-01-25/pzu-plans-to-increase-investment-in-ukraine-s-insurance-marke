PZU SA (PZU) , Poland’s biggest insurer,
plans to increase investment in neighboring Ukraine as part of
its foreign expansion.  The state-controlled insurer has invested more than 300
million zloty ($97 million) in the country, PZU Ukraine said in
a statement on its website today after a meeting of PZU Chief
Executive Officer Andrzej Klesyk and Ukrainian Prime Minister
 Mykola Azarov .  PZU Ukraine’s gross insurance premiums rose 23 percent in
the first half of 2012 from a year earlier “despite unfavorable
macroeconomic conditions,” the company said in the statement.  Warsaw-based PZU has offered insurance services in Ukraine
since 1993, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
