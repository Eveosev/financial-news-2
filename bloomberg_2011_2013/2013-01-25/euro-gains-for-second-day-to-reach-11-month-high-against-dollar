The euro rose to its strongest level
against the dollar in 11 months before the  European Central Bank 
gives a first indication of how much of its three-year loans
financial institutions plan to repay early.  Europe’s common currency was set for a seventh week of
gains versus the yen as the Ifo institute said German business
confidence rose more than economists predicted this month. The
yen headed for a record run of weekly losses against the dollar
as Japanese consumer prices fell. The pound slid to its weakest
level in more than a year against the euro after a government
report showed Britain’s economy shrank in the fourth quarter.  “The trend is relatively bullish” for the euro, said
 Roberto Mialich , a senior currency strategist at  UniCredit SpA (UCG) 
in Milan. “The underlying healthy tone should be reconfirmed.
The euro-dollar rate may also be helped by a firmer Ifo.”  The euro gained 0.4 percent to $1.3436 at 9:54 a.m.  London 
time, after climbing to $1.3443, the strongest level since Feb.
29. Against the yen, it appreciated 1.1 percent to 121.95, and
reached 122.19, the highest since April 12, 2011.  The Japanese currency declined 0.5 percent to 90.78 per
dollar, after depreciating as much as 0.6 percent to 90.91 per
dollar, the weakest level since June 2010. It was set for an
11th weekly loss, the longest losing streak in data compiled by
Bloomberg going back to 1971.  ECB Loans  The ECB is due to say how much of the 1 trillion euros in
three-year loans banks have pledged to hand back at the first
early-repayment opportunity on Jan. 30. The statement on the so-
called Longer-Term Refinancing Operations, which were granted to
ease the region’s debt crisis, is due at around noon in
 Frankfurt . Banks will initially repay 84 billion euros,
according to the median of 10 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.  KBC Bank NV said today it will give back 3.8 billion euros
of the loans in the first quarter.  The Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 104.2 from 102.4 in
December. That’s the highest since June. Economists predicted a
gain to 103, according to the median of 41 forecasts in a
 Bloomberg News survey .  The yen slipped as the statistics bureau in  Tokyo  said
Japanese consumer prices excluding fresh food fell 0.2 percent
in December from a year earlier. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  announced
open-ended asset purchases and a 2 percent inflation target this
week. Bank of  Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa told reporters in
Tokyo today that he will make “considerable efforts” to reach
the goal.  Selling Yen  Morgan Stanley recommended selling the yen versus the euro,
the  U.S. dollar  and Asian currencies, according to a report
yesterday.  The yen has fallen 7.3 percent in the past month, the
biggest decline among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 2.2
percent in the same period while the dollar was little changed.  Sterling slid 0.5 percent to 85.16 pence per euro, reaching
the weakest level since December 2011.  Gross domestic product  dropped 0.3 percent from the
previous three months, The  Office for National Statistics  said
in London. That compares with the median of 38 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey for a decline of 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
