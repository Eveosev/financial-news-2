Yandex NV (YNDX) , Russia’s largest search
engine, said  Facebook Inc. (FB)  blocked its new social application
for Apple Inc.’s iPhone and iPad mobile devices three hours
after it was released yesterday in the U.S.  Yandex introduced the  Wonder app  in the U.S. yesterday,
allowing users to retrieve information from Facebook, its
Instagram platform, Foursquare Labs Inc. and Twitter Inc.
networking websites about friends’ social activities. The
information can be retrieved by asking the application questions
either by voice or by typing.  “We will contact Facebook as soon as possible to figure
out the reason and ways to solve the problem,” Ochir
Mandzhikov, a spokesman at Moscow-based Yandex, said by phone.
The application was an experiment designed to target U.S. users,
and Wonder functions properly with Instagram, Foursquare and
Twitter, he said.  Earlier this week, Facebook cut off Twitter’s photo
application Vine and messaging app Voxer from Find Friends,
Facebook’s API that lets users connect with Facebook friends on
other apps,  TechCrunch  reported earlier today.  Varvara Fefilova, a spokeswoman for Facebook in Moscow,
didn’t immediately respond to messages left with colleagues
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
