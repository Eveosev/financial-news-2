The Australian dollar rose versus
the yen for a second day on speculation pressure will increase
on the  Bank of Japan (8301)  to expand stimulus after core consumer
prices in the nation declined last month.  The so-called kiwi dollar traded 0.3 percent from its
highest level versus the yen since September 2008 after minutes
of a BOJ policy meeting in December showed the central bank
intends to continue powerful easing. The Australian currency
reached a three-week low versus the  U.S. dollar  as traders
remained almost split on whether the  Reserve Bank  of Australia
will cut its benchmark  interest rate  on Feb. 5.  “We should see more yen weakness, and Aussie-yen as a
consequence is beginning to perform quite well,” said Jim Vrondas, the chief currency and payments strategist, Asia-
Pacific, at OzForex Ltd. in Sydney. “The market is quite
confident that the new regime in  Japan , for the time being at
least, is going to deliver on what they’re saying in a somewhat
aggressive way,” he said referring to  Liberal Democratic
Party ’s return to power after elections last month.  Australia’s dollar rose 0.2 percent to 94.56 yen as of 4:42
p.m. in Sydney. It fell as low as $1.0439, the weakest since
Jan. 4, before trading unchanged at $1.0451.  New Zealand’s dollar was little changed at 75.67 yen, after
reaching 75.89 yesterday, its strongest since September 2008. It
declined 0.2 percent to 83.63 U.S. cents.  The so-called Aussie may climb toward 100 yen and New
Zealand’s dollar may advance to 80 yen over the first quarter,
Vrondas said.  Japan Inflation  Japan’s consumer prices excluding fresh food fell 0.2
percent from a year earlier in December, the statistics bureau
reported in  Tokyo  today. BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa and his
board doubled their inflation target to 2 percent on Jan. 22,
announcing that the central bank will buy  government bonds 
indefinitely to help achieve the goal.  The  New Zealand dollar  is poised for its fifth-straight
weekly advance against the yen, gaining 0.3 percent since Jan.
18. The Aussie has slid 0.1 percent, halting four weeks of
gains.  Demand for the Australian dollar was tempered as swaps
traders bet on a 51 percent chance that the RBA will lower its
benchmark to 2.75 percent on Feb. 5. A Credit Suisse Group AG
 index  shows wagers on 51 basis points of cuts over the next 12
months, compared to 40 basis points on Jan. 18.  “The market is starting to price in more of a possibility
of a rate cut,” said Vrondas. “There’s definitely some strong
resistance at the $1.06 level.” Resistance refers to an area on
a chart where analysts anticipate orders to sell may be
clustered.  Yields on  Australia ’s 10-year bonds rose four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.21 percent, the first increase in
three days. New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment
made to receive floating rates which is sensitive to interest-
rate expectations, rose one basis points to 2.825 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
