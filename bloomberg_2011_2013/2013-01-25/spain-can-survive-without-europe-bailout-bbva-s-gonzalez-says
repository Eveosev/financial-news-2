Spain  can survive without needing a
European bailout as sentiment about the euro improves and
markets recognize its progress with economic reforms,  Banco
Bilbao (BBVA)  Vizcaya Argentaria Chairman Francisco Gonzalez said.  “Spain can survive -- there is no question about that,”
said Gonzalez, who heads Spain second-biggest bank, in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in Davos  Switzerland  today.
“Spain has addressed a lot of reforms over the last months and
investors definitely understand that Spain is going in the right
way.”  BBVA was among Spanish lenders that responded in 2012 to
orders to speed up the recognition of real estate losses as the
government prioritized a cleanup of bank balance sheets along
with efforts to reduce its  budget deficit . Funding conditions
have changed “dramatically” for the better in the past four
weeks and the Spanish economy will start to see “some light at
the end of the tunnel” by the end of this year, said Gonzalez.  “That’s the danger -- to be complacent,” said Gonzalez.
“Although the market conditions have changed dramatically for
the good in terms of liquidity, I expect the Spanish government
to go on in terms of reforms.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
