Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s
biggest maker of construction and mining equipment, reported the
first decline in retail machine sales in more than 2 1/2 years
after a slowdown in Asian demand.  Global machine sales in the three months through December
fell 1 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, the
Peoria, Illinois-based company said in a filing today. It saw a
7 percent drop in the Asia-Pacific region and a 6 percent
decline in North America, while other regions posted gains.  Sales have slowed with rising machinery inventories and
excess manufacturing capacity in  China , undermining the growth
experienced since Caterpillar Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Doug Oberhelman  took the helm in 2010. The company, an
economic bellwether, idled production in some plants last year
and in October forecast 2013 sales will be 5 percent lower to 5
percent higher than 2012.  The last time Caterpillar reported a decline in the numbers
was for the three-month period through April 2010, according to
data on the company’s website. Caterpillar also said today that
global power-system sales fell 2 percent.  “These are material changes,” Andrew Casey, a Boston-
based analyst for  Wells Fargo Securities LLC  who rates the
shares hold, said today in a report. “We expect a wider miss
and lower 2013 guidance” when Caterpillar reports earnings on
Jan. 28, he said.  Lower Estimates  Casey lowered his fourth-quarter earnings estimate for
Caterpillar to $1.45 a share from $1.66 earlier and his 2013
estimate to $8 a share from $8.20 a share. Analysts estimate
earnings of $1.70 a share in the quarter and $8.55 for the full
year, according to average  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said last week that it will report an 87-cent-
a-share charge in the fourth quarter for a writedown on a
Chinese acquisition, and offer its first guidance for 2013
before the start of trading on Jan. 28.  Caterpillar  fell  1.1 percent to $95.58 at the close in New
York.  The shares  have increased 6.7 percent this year.  Moderate demand and Caterpillar’s efforts to lower
production to reduce inventory and “relatively subdued
expectations” from U.S. construction and power generation
dealers also contributed to his estimate reduction, Casey said.  U.S. demand in the last three months of 2012 was affected
by political uncertainty following the November presidential
election and the debate on how to avert $600 billion of tax
increases and cost cuts, Ted Grace, a Boston-based analyst for
Susquehanna Financial Group, said today in a phone interview.  Caterpillar also had a “tough” year-ago comparison
because its sales were picking up rapidly in 2011 and 2010, he
said. Susquehanna is a market-maker for Caterpillar shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
