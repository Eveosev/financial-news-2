Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest  U.S. bank  by assets, has formed a global advisory
council to instruct senior executives on strengthening the
firm’s client relationships.  The 13 council members will include former French finance
minister and current chief executive officer of Atos Origin SA,
Thierry Breton, managing director of  Kuwait Investment
Authority , Bader Al-Saad, and Choi Chong-Suk, chairman of Korea
Investment Corp., Bank of America said in a statement today.  “Bank of America has relationships with clients who
compete in every region of the globe,” said CEO  Brian T. Moynihan , chairman of the council. “We thank our global
advisory council leaders for sharing their perspective,
experience, and judgment, which will help make us a better
partner for the clients.”  Moynihan has spent his first three years as CEO overhauling
the bank after his predecessor’s takeover of Countrywide
Financial Corp. and Merrill Lynch & Co., divesting more than $60
billion of assets. The bank announced an $11.7 billion deal to
end disputes with  Fannie Mae  on bad home loans this month and
joined an $8.5 billion industry accord to compensate for abusive
foreclosures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
