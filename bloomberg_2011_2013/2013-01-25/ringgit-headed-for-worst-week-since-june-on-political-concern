Malaysia’s ringgit headed for its
worst week since June on concern public support for Prime
Minister Najib Razak’s government is waning, increasing the risk
of policy disruptions.  Government bonds  retreated.  Approval rating for Najib, who must dissolve the nation’s
parliament by April 28, slid to a 16-month low in December,
according to a Jan. 10 statement from the Merdeka Center for
Opinion Research. His administration, which has been in power
since 1957, has embarked on a $444 billion, 10-year spending
plan to build roads, railways and power plants to boost economic
growth. Malaysian consumer prices rose 1.2 percent last month
from a year earlier, the slowest pace in almost three years,
according to a Jan. 23 government report.  “The uncertainty on the elections is in terms of whether
the incumbent government will maintain its stronger position
with the electorate,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a currency
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in  Singapore . “That has
shaken investor confidence a little bit.”  The ringgit declined 1.3 percent this week, the most since
the five days ended June 1, to 3.0530 per dollar as of 11:04
a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency dropped 0.4 percent today and touched 3.0583, the
weakest level since Jan. 2. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, held at 5.37 percent.  The yield on the 3.314 percent sovereign notes due October
2017 climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
3.25 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
