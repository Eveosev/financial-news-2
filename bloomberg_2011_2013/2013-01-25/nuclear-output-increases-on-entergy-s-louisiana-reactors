U.S. nuclear-power generation rose
for a third day as  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  increased output at two
reactors in Louisiana.  Nationwide production advanced 0.7 percent to 93,122
megawatts, or 91 percent of capacity, the highest level since
Jan. 21, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Output dropped 1.7 percent from  a year
ago , with eight of 104 reactors shut.  Generation at the 1,250-megawatt Waterford 3 plant rose to
93 percent of capacity from 58 percent yesterday.  The unit , 25
miles (40 kilometers) west of  New Orleans , tripped offline Jan.
21 when one of its steam generators reached a “low level
condition,” a commission filing showed.  Technicians repaired a valve on the feedwater system, which
supplies water to the generators, Carl Rhode, a company
spokesman based at the plant, said in an e-mail.  River Bend 1 operated at full power early today, a gain
from 77 percent of capacity yesterday. The 989-megawatt plant is
about 24 miles northwest of  Baton Rouge .  Output in the NRC’s West region, which includes Louisiana,
increased for a second day and reached its highest level since
Jan. 14.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is at its lowest, may
increase consumption of natural gas and coal to generate
electricity. The average refueling down time was 43 days in
2011, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
