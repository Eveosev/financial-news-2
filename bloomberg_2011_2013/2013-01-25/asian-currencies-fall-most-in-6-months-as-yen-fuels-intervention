Asian currencies fell this week by
the most since July as a slide in the yen fanned concern
regional central banks will intervene to prevent exchange-rate
gains that may hurt exports.  Officials from  Russia  to  Thailand  have voiced concern that
 Japan ’s intention to weaken the yen will stoke competitive
devaluations. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index retreated
from a 16-month high as the yen dropped for an 11th week.
Samsung Electronics Co. said yesterday that gains in the won,
which strengthened 8.3 percent in 2012, may cut operating profit
by 3 trillion won ($2.8 billion) this year.  “The authorities are getting more uncomfortable with sharp
appreciation against the dollar and the yen,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a strategist in Hong Kong at Societe Generale SA. The
uncertainty surrounding global growth, currency gains and the
risk of intervention are prompting retreats in regional
currencies, he said.  The Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the region’s 10 most-
active currencies excluding the yen, fell 0.6 percent this week
after touching 118.89 on Jan. 18, the highest level since
September 2011. The won declined 1.6 percent to 1,074.05 per
dollar in  Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Thai baht dropped 0.6 percent to 29.91 and the Philippine peso
lost 0.2 percent to 40.658.  Intervention Talk  The baht ended a seven-week rally, the won slumped by the
most since May and  Malaysia ’s ringgit had its worst week since
June. South Korean authorities have sold the won this month and
Taiwan’s central bank did the same on most days in the past nine
months, according to traders. The Philippines’ record-high
foreign-exchange reserves show the extent of central bank
intervention, Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said on Jan. 15.  The won fell as overseas investors pulled $990 million from
Korean stocks this week as the government hinted at more
measures to curb appreciation. Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan
said on Jan. 23 that gains in the won were too steep after the
currency extended last year’s advance to reach a 17-month high
of 1,054.49 per dollar on Jan. 15.  Taiwan’s Premier Sean Chen asked the central bank and
economic affairs ministry to closely monitor the effects of the
 Bank of Japan (8301) ’s monetary easing measures aimed at weakening the
yen. The Taiwan dollar fell 0.7 percent this week to N$29.25,
the most since the five days to June 1.  Malaysia Elections  Malaysia’s ringgit slipped 1.2 percent to 3.0490 per dollar
for the week amid concern investors will sell local stocks as a
general election approaches. The FTSE Bursa Malaysia Composite
Index of shares dropped 2.3 percent this week, the worst
performance since May.  “Investors could also be pricing in uncertainty ahead of
the general elections that must be called by end-April,”
according to a research note yesterday from Kuala Lumpur-based
 Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)   The baht completed its biggest weekly loss since June amid
concern its appreciation to a 17-month high will hurt exports.
Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said Jan. 24 he would like
to see the baht “a little bit” weaker as appreciation was
putting pressure on exporters.  Elsewhere in Asia,  China ’s  yuan  fell 0.1 percent this week
to 6.2205 per dollar, halting a three-week advance.  Indonesia ’s
rupiah weakened 0.2 percent to 9,653.  India ’s rupee was little
changed at 53.6850 after reaching a three-month high of 53.3800
on Jan. 22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
