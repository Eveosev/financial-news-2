ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  Chief Executive
Officer  Chanda Kochhar  said Indian lenders have posted
“reasonable” growth as the country didn’t suffer substantially
from the financial crisis.  “There is still a reasonable rate of growth for the
banking sector,”Kochhar said in a Bloomberg Television interview
with Olivia Sterns at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,
Switzerland. “I think the Indian banking sector will continue
to grow two and a half times the GDP. The banking sector is very
stable in terms of capital adequacy and ratios.”  “India did not suffer too much from the crisis per se,”
she said. “There has been a slowdown of growth in India partly
due to our own decision making internally. A lot of policy
reforms have been announced, but there is a lot more to be done,
especially to restart investments in infrastructure projects and
to have a clearer path to fiscal consolidation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
