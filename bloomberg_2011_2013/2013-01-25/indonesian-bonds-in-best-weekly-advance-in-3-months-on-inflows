Indonesia ’s bonds advanced this
week, prompting the yield on eight-year notes to fall the most
in almost three months, as foreign funds bought the securities
on optimism the local currency has stabilized.  Overseas investors added 940 billion rupiah ($96 million)
to their debt holdings last week, latest data from the finance
ministry show. The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, declined to the lowest level since Jan. 9. Indonesian
markets were closed for a holiday yesterday.  The yield on the 11 percent government bonds due November
2020 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, from
Jan. 23 to 5.14 percent as of 9:04 a.m. in Jakarta, the lowest
level since Jan. 8, according to prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association. The yield dropped 12 basis points this week,
the most since the five days ended Nov. 2.  “Shorter-term bonds have more room to rally as the yields
remain attractive,” said Suriyanto Chang, head of treasury at
PT Bank QNB Kesawan in Jakarta. “Confidence has returned after
seeing the rupiah sustain near current levels as authorities
intently guard its movements.”  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards declined
0.4 percent from Jan. 23 to 9,790 per dollar, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s 1.5 percent cheaper than the spot rate,
which dropped 0.1 percent to 9,643, prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg show.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivative contracts was
set at 9,759 yesterday by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .
The non-deliverable forwards gained 0.5 percent this week while
the spot rate weakened 0.1 percent.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah was unchanged at
6.25 percent today and 50 basis points lower than a week ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
