France  has asked the European Union
for speedy approval of loan guarantees for  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,
the EU’s antitrust chief said.  “The French government is asking us” for a “quick
analysis,” EU Competition Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  said in
an interview with Bloomberg Television in Davos,  Switzerland .
“It’s possible our conclusion will not be the conclusion
anticipated by the French government.”  France asked the EU to review 7 billion euros ($9.4
billion) in French government guarantees to shore up its ailing
finance arm. The government has said it doesn’t see the
guarantees as state aid that would require an EU investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
