Cosmo Pharmaceuticals SpA (COPN) , the
Italian company whose bowel-disease drug won U.S. approval this
month, rose the most in more than two years after forecasting
sales that were almost double an analyst’s estimate.  Cosmo jumped as much as 16 percent in Zurich, the biggest
intraday advance since September 2010. The stock was up 10
percent at 42 Swiss francs as of 11:57 a.m., giving the Lainate,
Italy-based company a market value of 630 million Swiss francs
($681 million). The number of shares traded was more than
48,000, about five times the daily average for the past three
months.  Santarus Inc. (SNTS) , which bought U.S. marketing rights for
Uceris in 2008, won approval for the drug as a treatment for
ulcerative colitis this month. The clearance is a “watershed”
that “will vastly increase our revenue potential,” Cosmo
founder and Chief Executive Officer Mauro Ajani said in a
 statement  today. The company expects sales of 67 million euros
($90 million) this year and 108 million euros in 2014, it said.  Peter Welford, an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd.
in  London , has estimated revenue of 53.5 million euros in 2013
and 57.2 million euros in 2014, according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
