Asian  stocks  fell the most since
November this week as  Apple Inc. suppliers  declined after the
iPhone maker reported its weakest sales since 2009 and some
investors speculated shares may have risen too far, too fast.  AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (2018) , which makes speakers for
Apple, dropped 3.9 percent in Hong Kong. Samsung Electronics Co.
fell to the lowest in almost two months in  Seoul  as the world’s
largest maker of mobile phones said the strengthening won may
cut operating profit by at least 3 trillion won ($2.8 billion)
this year.  Sony Corp. (6758)  soared in Tokyo trading as the Topix Index
posted its longest streak of weekly gains since January 1973,
boosted as the yen weakened against the dollar.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.7 percent to 131.74.
Gains in Japanese shares limited declines on the broader pan-
Asian benchmark as speculation the new government will take
steps to end deflation pushed the Topix higher for an 11th week.
The  MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index  dropped 0.8 percent.  “Markets are at highs and some investors are becoming
cautious after everyone turned bullish on stocks,” said Koji Toda, chief fund manager at Tokyo-based Resona Bank Ltd., which
oversees about $174 billion. “Most investors are still
optimistic on the equity market. Just because markets are
falling today doesn’t mean they will continue to drop.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific index (MXAP) , the benchmark regional
equities gauge, surged to the highest level in 17 months on Jan.
22. That left the measure trading at 14.3 times average
estimated earnings compared with 13.6 for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index and 12.3 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  International investors are the most bullish on stocks in
at least 3 1/2 years, with close to two-thirds planning to raise
their holdings of equities during the next six months, according
to a Bloomberg survey published Jan. 22. As the global financial
and business elite gathered in Davos for their annual forum, 53
percent of respondents to the Bloomberg Global Poll also said
equities will offer the highest return in the next year.  Australia ’s  S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  rose 1.3 percent this week,
to the highest level since April 2011. The gauge advanced for
the past eighth days, its longest streak of advances in almost
three years. Consumer prices last quarter rose less-than-
estimated a report showed Jan. 23, pushing down the local dollar
and giving the central bank scope to reduce interest rates
further.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell 0.1 percent and  China ’s
Shanghai Composite Index slid 1.1 percent. Singapore’s Straits
Times Index gained 1.8 percent and  Taiwan ’s Taiex Index slid 0.8
percent.  Japan ’s Topix gained 0.6 percent, marking its longest
weekly winning streak since 1973. The Bank of Japan this week
said it would shift to Federal Reserve-style open-ended asset
purchases and the yen weakened as falling consumer prices added
to the case for further easing. Exporters climbed. Sony climbed
12 percent to 1,290 yen and Panasonic Corp., the producer of
Viera televisions, increased 1.7 percent to 604 yen.  AAC Technologies declined 3.9 percent to HK$28.35. Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co., which assembles iPhones, slid 2.3
percent to NT$83.40. Apple reported its slowest profit growth
since 2003. Initial iPhone 5 sales were lower than some
investors expected due to supply shortages, while consumers
criticized new mapping software.  Samsung fell 4.3 percent to 1.417 million won, dragging the
 Kospi index  down 2.1 percent for the week. The phone maker’s
comments on its 2013 forecast overshadowed a better-than-
expected 76 percent jump in fourth-quarter profit to 7.04
trillion won. Samsung accounts for 19 percent of the Kospi and
is the heaviest- weighted  company in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Thai Beverage Pcl rose 2.3 percent to 44.5  Singapore  cents.
Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd. said Jan. 21 that it won’t match
Thai billionaire Charoen’s S$13.8 billion ($11.2 billion) offer
for Fraser & Neave Ltd., ending the bidding war for the
Singapore-based company. Overseas Union added 4.8 percent to
S$2.85 and Fraser & Neave slipped 0.3 percent to S$9.55.  China Vanke Co., the country’s biggest publicly traded
property developer, surged 29 percent to HK$16.16 in the
southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, on plans to move trading of
its foreign-currency denominated B shares to Hong Kong. The
company’s shares resumed trading on Jan. 21 after being
suspended since Dec. 25 pending the transfer decision.  Karoon Gas Australia Ltd. gained 16 percent to A$6.15 after
the explorer said it discovered oil in  Brazil . The discovery
provides “confidence in the other prospects within Karoon’s
blocks,” the Mt. Martha, Victoria-based company said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
