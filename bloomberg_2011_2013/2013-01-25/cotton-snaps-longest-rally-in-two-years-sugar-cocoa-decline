Cotton fell for the first time in
eight sessions after the government reported slowing exports
from the U.S., the world’s top shipper. Sugar and cocoa also
dropped, while orange juice and coffee gained.  In the week ended Jan. 17,  exports  of upland cotton dropped
37 percent to 213,700 running bales from a week earlier, the
 U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today. Prices climbed 9.8
percent in the past seven sessions, the longest rally in almost
two years, on expectations of higher demand from  China , the
biggest consumer.  “There isn’t an export number that could’ve been high
enough to sustain that rally,”  Sharon Johnson , a senior cotton
specialist at Roswell, Georgia-based Knight Futures, said in a
telephone interview. “The market was primed for a sizable
setback.”  Cotton for March delivery dropped 1.2 percent to 81.87
cents a pound at 11:12 a.m. on ICE Futures in New York. A close
at that price would be the biggest loss since Dec. 28.  A running bale weighs 500 pounds, or 22 kilograms.  Also in New York, raw-sugar futures for delivery in March
slumped 0.8 percent to 18.35 cents a pound, on pace for the
eighth loss in nine sessions.  Cocoa futures for March delivery fell 0.9 percent to $2,175
a metric ton on ICE, heading for the fourth loss in five
sessions.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery climbed 0.2 percent
to $1.134 a pound in  New York , while arabica-coffee futures for
March delivery gained 0.7 percent to $1.4755 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
