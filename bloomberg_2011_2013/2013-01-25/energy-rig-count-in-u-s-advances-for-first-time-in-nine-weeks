The gas and oil rig count in the
U.S. gained for the first time in nine weeks, according to data
from  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Total energy rigs rose by four to 1,753, the first increase
since Nov. 23.  Oil rigs  dropped by one to 1,315, data posted on
the Baker Hughes website show. The  gas count  rose five to 434,
the field-services company based in Houston said.  The total count has dropped from 2,008 a year ago as
natural-gas exploration declines and technological advances in
oil-drilling yield more output from wells, weakening producers’
appetite for new rigs. Crude production rose this month to the
highest level since 1993, and stockpiles of the feedstock grew
in June to the largest in 22 years.  U.S. rigs are expected to drop 5 percent this year,
remaining “flat” during the first quarter, Peter Ragauss,
Baker Hughes’ chief financial officer, said during a conference
call with investors Jan. 23. The count fell sharply at end of
last year “due to customers shutting down early before the
holiday period.”  Crude for March delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange slipped 3 cents to $95.92 a barrel at 12:20 p.m., down
3.5 percent from a year ago.  U.S. oil output  slipped  0.7 percent to 6.99 million barrels
a day in the seven days ended Jan. 18 after reaching the highest
level since January 1993 a week earlier, according to data
compiled by the Energy Information Administration, a division of
the Energy Department. Stockpiles climbed 0.8 percent to 363.1
million barrels last week. They rose to a 22-year high of 387.3
million barrels in June.  Natural gas for February delivery declined 1.1 cents to
$3.435 per million British thermal units on the Nymex at 12:17
p.m. today. Futures are up 26 percent from a year ago.  Gas stockpiles  fell 172 billion cubic feet last week to
2.996 trillion, the EIA said yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
