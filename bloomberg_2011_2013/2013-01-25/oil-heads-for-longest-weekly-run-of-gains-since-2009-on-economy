Crude headed for a seventh weekly
advance in  New York , the longest run of gains in almost four
years, amid signs of global economic growth and concern that oil
facilities in North Africa are vulnerable to militant attacks.  West  Texas  Intermediate crude advanced as much as 0.6
percent as German business confidence rose for a third month in
January. The  European Central Bank  said 278 banks will hand back
137.2 billion euros ($184.4 billion) of its three-year loans
next week at the first opportunity for early repayment. The
U.K., German and Dutch governments yesterday urged their
citizens to leave the Libyan city of Benghazi.  “Global risk sentiment remains fairly upbeat,” said
 Andrey Kryuchenkov , a commodities analyst at VTB Capital in
 London , who predicts WTI will trade from $93 to $97 a barrel
over the next month.  Crude for March delivery gained as much as 54 cents to
$96.49 a barrel and was at $96.35 in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:32 p.m. London time. Futures
climbed 0.8 percent to $95.95 yesterday and are up 0.8 percent
this week. A seventh weekly gain would be the longest rising
streak since April 2009. The average volume of all futures
traded today was 3 percent below the 100-day average.  Brent for March settlement gained as much as 56 cents to
$113.84 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange, the highest since Oct. 17. The European benchmark
contract was at a premium of $17.28 after contracting to $15.16
on Jan. 17, the narrowest in almost six months.  Business Confidence  The German Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 104.2 from 102.4 in
December. That’s the highest since June. Economists predicted a
gain to 103, according to the median of 41 forecasts in a
 Bloomberg News  survey.  WTI declined 7.1 percent in 2012 as the U.S. shale boom
deepened a supply glut at Cushing. That left it at an average
discount of $17.47 a barrel to Brent last year, compared with a
premium of about 7 cents in the five years through 2010. Brent,
the benchmark grade for more than half the world’s crude,
advanced 3.5 percent last year.  New York futures dropped relative to Brent this week after
 Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD)  said deliveries via the Seaway
pipeline to the Jones Creek, Texas, terminal were limited. The
system, which runs from Cushing to refineries near Houston, was
operating at a rate higher than 175,000 barrels a day, company
spokesman  Rick Rainey  said yesterday, without giving a specific
figure. Houston-based Enterprise and its partner,  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ,
completed an expansion of Seaway on Jan. 11 that boosted
capacity to 400,000 barrels a day.  Cushing Inventories  Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI, decreased for the first time since November, according to
the Energy Information Administration. Cushing stockpiles slid
471,000 barrels to 51.4 million in the seven days ended Jan. 18,
the first decline in seven weeks, the EIA’s report showed. Total
U.S. crude inventories climbed 2.8 million barrels to 363.1
million. Supplies were forecast to increase 2.2 million barrels,
according to the median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Gasoline stockpiles decreased  1.7 million barrels  to 233.3
million, the report showed. They were projected to rise 1.3
million barrels, according to the Bloomberg survey. Distillate
inventories, including heating oil and diesel, rose 508,000
barrels to 132.9 million, compared with a prediction for
supplies to be unchanged.  Prices may rise next week, a separate Bloomberg survey of
36 analysts showed. Eighteen of 36 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 50 percent, forecast crude will increase through
Feb. 1. Eleven respondents, or 31 percent, predicted a drop.
Seven said there would be little change. Last week, 39 percent
of analysts projected a gain.  Libya Security  Oil in New York has long-term technical support along its
100-week moving average, around $95 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures have halted intraday declines
near this indicator in the four days through yesterday. Buy
orders tend to be clustered close to chart-support levels.  Libya , a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, pumped an average of 1.54 million barrels of oil a
day last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
country is reinforcing security at oil and gas installations
near its southern border after last week’s terrorist attack in
 Algeria .  The Jan. 16 al-Qaeda-linked assault on a natural gas plant
partly run by  BP Plc (BP/)  resulted in the deaths of at least 38
foreign hostages. The terrorists were wore Libyan uniforms,
Algeria’s privately run Ennahar television said on its website
last week, citing government officials it didn’t identify.  To contact the reporter on this story:
