Canada ’s  federal budget  deficit
widened in November from a year earlier, as corporate  tax
revenue  fell.  The shortfall widened to C$1.85 billion ($1.83 billion)
during the month from C$1.63 billion a year earlier, the finance
department said in a  monthly report  from Ottawa. Revenue dropped
0.3 percent to C$19.9 billion, as income from corporate taxes
fell 5.6 percent and sales tax proceeds shrank 5.9 percent.  Canada’s economy probably had its worst six-month
performance since the end of the 2009 recession in the second
half of last year, as exports declined and concerns about the
global expansion prompted businesses to curb spending, leading
economists and policy makers to scale back their expectations
for 2013.  Alberta Premier Alison Redford said in a televised address
yesterday her province will collect C$6 billion less revenue in
2013 as a result of the low price of Canadian heavy oil.  The deteriorating fiscal outlook is making it more
difficult to bring the federal budget into balance as planned by
2015, a person with direct knowledge of the government’s budget
planning told  Bloomberg News  last week.  Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty , seeking to return the
country to surplus while ensuring fiscal tightening doesn’t
impede growth, scaled back revenue projections in a November
budget  update  by C$7.1 billion for the next fiscal year and by
C$36 billion over five years, citing lower commodity prices.  The deficit in the first eight months of the fiscal year
narrowed to C$12.4 billion from C$15.5 billion in the previous
period. Revenue rose 3.1 percent in the period, while program
expenses were up 2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
