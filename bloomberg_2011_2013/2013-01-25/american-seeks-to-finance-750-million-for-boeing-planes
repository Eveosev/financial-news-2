American Airlines parent  AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) 
is seeking as much as $750 million in financing backed by
aircraft, including  Boeing Co. (BA)  planes that will be delivered
this year.  American wants court approval to finance the Boeing
aircraft and repay existing aircraft debt maturing in May and
July, according to a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan.  The request comes after Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR, which
filed for bankruptcy in 2011, won court approval for $1.5
billion in aircraft financing to take advantage of lower
interest rates, defeating bondholder opposition.  The $750 million will be backed by the Boeing planes and
nine aircraft now owned by AMR, according to the filing. AMR has
an agreement to buy as many as four Boeing 777-323ER aircraft
scheduled for delivery from April to August, the carrier said.  The case is in re AMR Corp., 11-15463,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
