Thailand ’s baht was headed for its
biggest weekly loss since June amid concern its appreciation to
a 17-month high versus the dollar and a four-year high against
the yen will hurt exports. Government bonds held steady.  The currency snapped a run of seven weekly rallies after
Thailand reported  overseas sales  data on Jan. 23 that missed
economist estimates. Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said
yesterday he would like to see the baht “a little bit” weaker
as appreciation was putting pressure on exporters. The currency
reached the strongest level since August 2011 versus the dollar
on Jan. 21 and hit the highest level since October 2008 versus
the yen today.  “The authorities are getting more uncomfortable with sharp
appreciation against the dollar and the yen,” said Wee-Khoon
Chong, a strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong .  The baht slumped 0.4 percent from a week ago and 0.2
percent today to 29.86 per dollar as of 8:50 a.m. in Bangkok,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That was the first
five-day loss since a period ended Nov. 16 and the biggest
weekly drop since June 22. It rose 0.7 percent today versus the
Japanese currency to 3.0289 yen, earlier hitting a four-year
high of 3.0410 earlier.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, jumped 35 basis points,
or 0.35 percentage point, to 4.67 percent this week. The rate
climbed 22 basis points today.  Exports, which account for about two-thirds of Thailand’s
economy, rose 13 percent in December after an increase of 27
percent the previous month, according to official data. The
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a
gain of 21.5 percent.  Japan  is the second-largest buyer of Thai
shipments, after  China , and the U.S. is the third-biggest.  The yield on the 3.125 percent  government bonds  due
December 2015 held steady this week and today at 2.93 percent,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
