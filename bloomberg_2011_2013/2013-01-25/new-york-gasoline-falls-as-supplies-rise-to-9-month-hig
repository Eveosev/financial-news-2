Gasoline weakened for the first time
in four days in the  New York  Harbor as inventories of motor fuel
in the region reached a  nine-month high .  Stockpiles of gasoline in the Central Atlantic area
including the New York Harbor, which is known as PADD 1B, gained
 1.82 million  barrels to 28.8 million in the week ended Jan. 18,
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, an
agency of the Energy Department.  Supplies rose for a fifth consecutive week as the region’s
refinery activity hovered at the highest  seasonal level  in four
years and nationwide demand for gasoline increased. U.S.  East
Coast refineries  processed about 1.1 million barrels last week,
while gasoline  consumption  in the U.S. rose to 8.43 million
barrels a day, the highest in three weeks, EIA data showed.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol in the New
York Harbor, or 84-octane RBOB, slipped 0.25 cent to 1.13 cents
a gallon under futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
3:37 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conventional
gasoline on the New York spot market gained 0.25 cent to a
premium of 3.13 cents.  The 3-2-1 crack spread, a measure of refining profitability
based on Brent oil in Europe, slipped 4 cents to $9.0198 a
barrel at 4:18 p.m.  Diesel Prices  New York’s ultra-low-sulfur diesel strengthened after
supplies of distillates including  diesel fuel  and heating oil
dropped 177,000 barrels to 24.2 million last week in the Central
Atlantic, according to EIA data. The premium for the fuel gained
0.12 cent to  5 cents  a gallon over heating oil futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel on the U.S. Gulf Coast rose 1.06
cents to 0.32 cent below futures. Conventional 87-octane
gasoline in the region fell 0.8 cent to 19.3 cents below
futures.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  for Gulf Coast refiners, based on
West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,  Oklahoma , dropped 51.8 cents
to $21.647 a barrel. The  same spread  for Light Louisiana Sweet
oil slipped $2.2184 to 64.74 cents a barrel, the lowest since
Dec. 18, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
