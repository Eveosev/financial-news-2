Ukio Bankas (UKB1L) , a Lithuanian lender
whose accounts prosecutors in the Baltic nation said were used
to transfer $13 million of funds connected to a Russian tax-
fraud case, denied that it was the object of a probe.  Baltic News Service  on Jan. 22 reported that prosecutors
are investigating claims that the funds may have been laundered
through Ukio Bankas. The probe was initiated in response to a
request by the investment fund Hermitage Capital Management,
where deceased lawyer Sergei Magnitsky uncovered the alleged
embezzlement, the news service said.  “The recent naming of Ukio Bankas AB in connection with
the so-called Magnitsky case led to rushed public accusations,
as if the bank had ‘laundered’ large sums of money, though no
investigation of the bank or any of its employees is under
way,” Arnas Zalys, chairman of the bank based in Kaunas,
 Lithuania , said in a statement released today through the ELTA
news service.  The bank abides by all Lithuanian laws and European Union
directives regarding the prevention of  money laundering  and is,
within its competence, assisting law enforcement officials in
the criminal investigations, Zalys said.  Lithuania’s largest publicly traded bank has dropped 7.5
percent to near the lowest in almost nine years since the BNS
report. It fell 0.9 percent to 0.111 litas today, retreating for
a fourth day.  “Imprecise interpretations and unfounded accusations about
presumed criminal behavior are hurting not only the reputation
of Ukio Bankas, but also the entire banking market here and the
country’s image,” Zalys said, according to ELTA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
