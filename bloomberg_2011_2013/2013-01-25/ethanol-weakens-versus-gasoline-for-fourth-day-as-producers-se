Ethanol weakened for a fourth day
against gasoline as producers sold the fuel to take advantage of
prices near the highest level in seven weeks.  The ethanol-gasoline spread expanded by 1.85 cents,
extending the biofuel’s longest streak of losses versus the
motor fuel in five weeks. The additive is on track to the first
monthly gain since October and has risen 8.5 percent to start
the year.  “We’ve had a good run-up here,” said Jerrod Kitt, an
analyst at Linn Group in  Chicago . “It makes some sense to go
out here and sell and lock in margins.”  The grain-based additive was 49.94 cents cheaper than
gasoline, based on prompt-month contracts for both commodities,
the widest since Jan. 10. The spread was 48.09 cents yesterday.  Denatured ethanol for February delivery slid 0.6 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.376 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Gasoline for February delivery rose 1.25 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $2.8754 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Corn for March delivery fell 3.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$7.2075 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 23 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
figures exclude the revenue that can be made from the sale of
dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production that
can be fed to livestock.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast was
unchanged at $2.57 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the additive
slid 1 cent to $2.42, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol in  New York  fell 1 cent to $2.47 a gallon and in
Chicago the biofuel declined 1.5 cents to $2.37.  To contact the reporter on this story:
