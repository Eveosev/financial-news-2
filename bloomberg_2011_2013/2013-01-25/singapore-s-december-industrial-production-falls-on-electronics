Singapore ’s industrial production
fell for the fourth time in five months in December as
manufacturers produced fewer electronics items.  Manufacturing declined 0.6 percent from a year earlier
after a revised 2.9 percent increase in November, the  Economic
Development Board  said in a report today. The median of 18
economists  surveyed  by  Bloomberg News  was for a 4.8 percent
drop. For the whole year, output gained 0.1 percent.  The export-dependent nation is struggling to cope with
faltering demand for its goods even as the global economy shows
signs of improvement. While data indicates recoveries in the
U.S., China and  Europe  are gaining traction, Singapore’s
overseas  shipments  declined the most in 14 months in December.  Singapore’s industrial production outlook is “rather
bleak,” Wai Ho Leong, a Singapore-based economist at Barclays
Plc, said before the report. The optimism in Europe, China and
the U.S. is “just not feeding through into our numbers and is
feeding through instead into North Asia,” he said.  The  Singapore dollar  fell 0.2 percent to S$1.2312 against
its U.S. counterpart at 12:08 p.m. local time.  Output increased a seasonally adjusted 5.4 percent from the
previous month, when it rose a revised 1.8 percent.  Electronics production declined 16.9 percent from a year
earlier in December, while pharmaceutical output gained 21
percent. Chemicals gained 4.4 percent, the report showed.  Production in the fourth quarter fell 1.1 percent, less
than the government’s Jan. 2 preliminary estimate of a 1.5
percent contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
