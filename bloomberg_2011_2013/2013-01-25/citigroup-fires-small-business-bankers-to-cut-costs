Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. lender, is firing some small-business bankers in the U.S.
as Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat  cuts costs in an area
where competitors are hiring.  The U.S. retail banking unit is “realigning,” Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. She declined to say how many
bankers were being fired.  “While this realignment will result in the elimination of
some positions, we will continue to provide easier banking and
excellent service for our small-business clients,” she said.  Corbat, 52, is trimming thousands of Citigroup employees
and overhauling operations as he seeks to reduce expenses and
improve the lender’s profit. The reduction contrasts with the
strategy adopted by  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  CEO  Brian T. Moynihan ,
who said Dec. 4 that he added almost 6,000 small-business
bankers and financial advisers in 2012.  Citigroup committed in 2011 to lend $24 billion to small
businesses over three years, Pulley said.  “We are on track to once again surpass our lending goal of
$8 billion in 2012,” Pulley said. “These changes reflect our
strategy to optimize our staffing needs in the branches.”  Citigroup’s North America retail bank had about $160
billion of average deposits at the end of 2012, a 9 percent
increase from a year earlier. Commercial loans by the unit
increased 23 percent to $7.9 billion over the same period.  Revenue at the North America consumer-banking unit, which
includes the lender’s credit-card operations, climbed 5 percent
to $21.1 billion in 2012 from a year earlier. Profit jumped 18
percent to $4.81 billion.  Citigroup rose 1.9 percent to close yesterday at $42.80 in
New York. The shares have advanced 8.2 percent this year,
compared with the 5.2 percent gain of the 24-company  KBW Bank
Index. (BKX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
