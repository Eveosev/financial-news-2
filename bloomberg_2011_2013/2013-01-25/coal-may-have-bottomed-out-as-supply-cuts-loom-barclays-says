Coal prices may have touched bottom
and be poised to rise as disruptions from Colombia to Indonesia
threaten supplies, Barclays Plc’s investment-banking unit said
in a report.  Benchmark contracts are on the verge of breaking out of a
range as workers at Cerrejon, a Colombian  coal mine  owned by  BHP
Billiton Plc (BHP) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and  Anglo America Plc (AAL) , prepare to
strike as early as next week,  Trevor Sikorski , an analyst at
Barclays in London, wrote today. Bad weather in the Pacific
Basin may affect shipments from Australia and Indonesia and rail
work stoppages may arise in New South Wales, Australia, he said.  “Further price downside could be limited, given the low
prevailing levels and the potentially bullish drivers”
outlined, Sikorski said.  Coal on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange has declined 3.8
this year to $55.83 a ton as of yesterday.  Thermal coal for 2014 delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp, the European benchmark, rose 1 percent to $100 a metric
ton today, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg, down
$2.10 this year.  Spot prices for coal shipped from Richards Bay ,  South
Africa , fell $1.84, or 2.1 percent, to $85.50 a metric ton as of
Jan. 18, a 10-week low, data provided by IHS McCloskey show.  The threatened strike at Cerrejon, Colombia’s largest mine,
“could have lasting impact in Q1 exports out of the country,”
Sikorski wrote.  A strike may remove 600,000 metric tons a week from the
market, or 40 percent of Colombia’s exports, and that would lift
European coal prices, Sikorski said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
