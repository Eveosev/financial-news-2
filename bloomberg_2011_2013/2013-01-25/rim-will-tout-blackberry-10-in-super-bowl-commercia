Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  plans to
promote its new BlackBerry 10 phones in the company's first 
 Super Bowl  commercial, aiming to stoke demand for a product 
lineup that will be unveiled next week.  The ad will be part of a marketing blitz for the Waterloo,
Ontario-based company, which is counting on the BlackBerry 10 to
win back smartphone customers from Apple Inc. and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s
Android. In addition to airing a 30-second spot during the Super
Bowl, RIM will promote the new products on Facebook and Twitter,
the company said today in a statement.  “A Super Bowl commercial is a great opportunity to show the
redesigned, re-engineered and reinvented BlackBerry to tens of
millions of consumers on the largest advertising stage of the
year,” Frank Boulben, RIM’s chief marketing officer, said in the
statement.  Companies are paying as much as $4 million for a 30-second
spot, according to  CBS Corp. (CBS) , which is airing the Super Bowl.
The game, which determines the National Football League’s
champion, will be broadcast on Feb. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
