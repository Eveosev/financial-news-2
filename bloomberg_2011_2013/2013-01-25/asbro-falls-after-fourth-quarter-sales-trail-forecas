Hasbro Inc. (HAS) , the maker of Nerf,
Playskool and Transformers toys, fell the most in nine months
after saying preliminary fourth-quarter sales trailed its
forecast because of weaker demand in the U.S.  The shares slid 4 percent to $36.91 at 10:16 a.m. in New
York and earlier dropped as low as $36.60 for the biggest
intraday decline since April 23. Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based
Hasbro rose 13 percent last year, about matching the gain of the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  “Consumer demand through much of the holiday season was
less than anticipated in both the U.S. and certain international
markets,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Goldner said today in a
statement. “As a result, fourth quarter revenues did not meet
our expectations.”  Hasbro said revenue for 2012 was about $4.09 billion, a 4.7
percent decline from 2011 and less than analysts’ average
estimate of $4.21 billion. The results imply fourth-quarter
revenue of about $1.28 billion. Analysts estimated $1.41
billion, on average.  Per-share profit for the year, excluding restructuring
charges, was about $2.73 to $2.75. The figure includes a
negative effect of about 10 cents a share because of foreign-
currency exchange rate fluctuations. Analysts predicted $2.83,
on average.  Hasbro said it plans to reduce its workforce by about 10
percent, consolidate facilities and improve some processes. The
actions will result in about $20 million to $30 million in
pretax charges in 2013, the company said.  Hasbro is scheduled to report full fourth-quarter results
on Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
