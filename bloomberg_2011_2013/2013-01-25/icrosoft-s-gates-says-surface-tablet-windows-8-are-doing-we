Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  Chairman Bill Gates
said in an interview with CNBC that the company’s new Surface
tablet and the latest version of its Windows operating system
have done “well.”  Gates, former chief executive officer of the world’s
largest software maker, also said he has no plans to resume that
role.  Even as Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft faces stiff
competition in its markets, the company has the potential to
lead in several areas, he said in the interview.  “Windows 8 has done well,” he said. “Surface computer is
doing well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
