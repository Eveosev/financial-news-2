Tibetans should avoid celebrating
their New Year next month and instead say prayers for the rising
number of activists setting themselves on fire to protest
Chinese rule, the Tibetan government-in-exile said, urging an
end to the practice.  Three Tibetans have died so far this year after carrying
out self-immolations, with a 26-year-old the most recent to die
a few days ago, the Tibetan leadership said in a  statement . That
adds to 83 Tibetans who died after setting themselves ablaze
last year, including 28 in November alone, according to the
statement.  “I request my fellow Tibetans to not celebrate Losar with
our usual festivities,” Lobsang Sangay, prime minister in the
exiled administration, said in the statement referring to the
region’s new year festival. “Instead, when this year’s holiday
falls on February 11, I ask you to perform only the customary
religious rituals like visiting temples and making offerings.”  Tibetans say China is attacking their culture, religion and
environment with policies that have moved thousands of ethnic
Han Chinese into Tibet in the name of economic development.  The Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, has lived in
northern India since fleeing in 1959, when China’s military took
over the region. China accuses the Dalai Lama of waging a
campaign for independence while the spiritual leader says he is
seeking autonomy for Tibet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
