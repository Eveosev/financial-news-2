Cattle prices will jump 7.3 percent
this year in the U.S., after a crop-damaging drought in 2012 led
to a smaller herd, according to Rich Nelson, the chief
strategist at broker Allendale Inc.  Slaughterhouses will pay $1.32 a pound on average on cash
markets for spot supplies in 2013, up from $1.23 last year,
Nelson said today at Allendaleâ€™s annual meeting in Crystal Lake,
 Illinois . About 32.95 million head of cattle were processed last
year, down 3.3 percent from 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said in a Jan. 24 report.  Supplies of slaughter-ready animals will keep falling
because the cost of corn feed surged after the drought, the
worst since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, dried up pastures
and forced livestock producers to shrink herds, Nelson said.  During the first quarter of 2013, cash cattle will average
$1.29, according to McHenry, Illinois-based Allendale. After
slipping to $1.28 in the second quarter, prices will rally to
$1.35 in the third and fourth quarters, the broker said. Beef
production is expected to decline annually through 2015,
according to Allendale.  Cattle futures gained 8.9 percent last year to $1.36375 a
pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. They are down 1.2
percent this month, closing today at $1.3075.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
