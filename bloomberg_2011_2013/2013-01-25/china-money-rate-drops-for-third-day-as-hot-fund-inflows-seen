China ’s money-market rate dropped
for a third day on speculation capital inflows will increase
this year as a recovery in the world’s second-biggest economy
gains momentum.  The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China’s
currency regulator, said the nation may face an influx of “hot
money” as the economy stabilizes and global liquidity
increases. The central bank drained a net 49 billion  yuan  ($7.9
billion) from the financial market this week, a fourth week of
withdrawals, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Capital inflows will help increase cash supply in the
financial system,” said Liu Junyu, a bond analyst in Shenzhen
at China Merchants Bank Co., the nation’s sixth-biggest lender.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 14 basis points today and this
week to 2.70 percent as of 10:52 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to
a weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank
Funding Center.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined two
basis points today and this week to 3.15 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The preliminary reading of a  Purchasing Managers ’ Index was
51.9 in January, compared with the 51.5 final reading for
December, according to a statement from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics yesterday. Fifty is the dividing line between
expansion and contraction.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
