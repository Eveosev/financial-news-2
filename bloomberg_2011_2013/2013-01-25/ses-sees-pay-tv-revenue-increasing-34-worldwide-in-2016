SES SA (SESG) , the world’s largest publicly
traded satellite operator, sees pay-TV services as “a key
driver” of growth in the telecommunications industry globally
over the next four years.  Pay TV is forecast to generate industry revenue of $259
billion in 2016 from $194 billion in 2012, Leszek Bujak, sales
director for Central and Eastern  Europe  at SES, said in an
interview in the Serbian capital Belgrade yesterday.  “With continuous decline of fixed subscribers, stagnancy
in subscriber growth in telephony and broadband, pay-TV service
becomes a key viable complementary service,” Bujak said.  The Luxembourg-based company, whose customers include
 Telefonica SA (TEF) , Spain’s biggest phone company, has 52 satellites
and is adding capacity to accommodate demand.  The fastest revenue expansion of 18 percent is estimated in
 South America , followed by 11 percent in Asia Pacific and 8
percent in Europe, Africa and the  Middle East , Bujak said. In
 North America , the revenue level may remain unchanged, he said.  Pay-TV penetration will probably increase on all continents
except in North America in the next four years, according to the
SES forecast based on research by the IHS Screen Digest, he
said. The penetration will grow most in South America, reaching
54 percent through 2016 from 40 percent in 2012.  It will decline to 83 percent from 86 percent in North
America in four years, while growing 5 percentage points in
Europe and 9 percentage points and Asia-Pacific to 65 percent
and 79 percent respectively.  Africa  and the Middle East will see
the smallest, 1 percentage point increase in penetration to 15
percent.  Falling Prices  The growth may be supported by falling prices for high-
definition TV sets, now at less than 700 euros ($939) a piece
from more than 4,000 euros five years ago, he said.  “HD is becoming a standard and people start to expect good
quality,” which also helped reduce the replacement cycle for TV
by 10 percent over the past three years to 7.5 years.  Average viewing time is also expected to increase, now at 3
hours and 16 minutes globally, as will the average size of new
TV screens sold, now at 35 inches (0.89 meter), he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
