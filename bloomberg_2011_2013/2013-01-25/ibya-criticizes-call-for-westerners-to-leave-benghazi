Libya’s Interior Ministry criticized
warnings by several Western governments against travel to
Benghazi, saying such calls were not justified, the state-run
Libya News Agency reported.  The British, German and Dutch governments yesterday urged
their citizens to leave Benghazi immediately, citing threats to
Westerners in the country’s second-largest city, where the
uprising against Muammar Qaddafi began.  The security situation in Benghazi is stabilizing after the
police and military expanded their presence, LNA reported,
citing an unidentified Interior Ministry official who said the
warnings by the three European countries are without basis.  Libya’s central government has struggled to control
Islamist groups that have been blamed for the killing of the
U.S. ambassador in September. The travel warnings also came
barely a week after militants took dozens of foreigners hostage
in neighboring  Algeria . Authorities there said the attackers had
entered the country from Libya.  To contact the reporter on this story:
