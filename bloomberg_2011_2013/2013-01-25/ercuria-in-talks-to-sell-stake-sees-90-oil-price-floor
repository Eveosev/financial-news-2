Mercuria Energy Trading SA is still
in discussions to sell a 10 to 20 percent stake in the company
this year amid more stable oil prices, according to the
company’s chief executive officer.  “We will probably have some news in the next six months,”
Marco Dunand, the company’s CEO and co-founder, said in an
interview at the  World Economic Forum  in Davos,  Switzerland 
today. “For us, it will be more a year of consolidation than
expansion.”  The Geneva-based company’s revenue rose to $100 billion
last year, Dunand said. That’s up from $76 billion in 2011. The
CEO said in April last year that Mercuria was in early talks
with potential investors to sell a stake of as much as 20
percent as it diversifies into non-energy commodity markets and
enlarges operations in  China  and elsewhere.  Oil markets will maintain “a certain stability with last
year” even as prices may be “marginally lower,” he said
today. Crude probably won’t drop below a range of $90 to $100 a
barrel because the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would cut production to stop prices from falling, Dunand said.  Brent crude  was little changed at $113.34 a barrel as of
5:46 p.m. today in  London  on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.
The North Sea grade, which is used as a benchmark for more than
half of the world’s crude, gained 3.5 percent last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
