Stocks in Switzerland  were little
changed, after the Swiss Market Index climbed to a 4 1/2-year
high yesterday, as a report showed sales of new houses in the
U.S. in December fell short of economists’ estimates.  Novartis AG lost 0.7 percent after saying U.S. prosecutors
have begun an investigation into its marketing practices.
Transocean Ltd., the world’s largest offshore-rig contractor,
slid 0.9 percent.  The  SMI (SMI)  added less than 0.1 percent to 7,458.66 at the
close in Zurich. The gauge has advanced 1.2 percent this week.
It surged yesterday to its highest level since June 2008 as the
Swiss franc weakened against the euro and the U.S. House of
Representatives voted to temporarily suspend the government’s
borrowing limit. The broader Swiss Performance Index increased
0.1 percent today.  “Swiss stocks have been among the top performers of the
year so far, and their gains this week are driven in part by a
weaker franc,” said Christoph Riniker, head of strategy
research at Julius Baer Group Ltd. in Zurich. “Fundamental
factors including valuation and exposure to defensive stocks
point to some caution in investing.”  In the U.S., a report showed  new-house sales  unexpectedly
declined to a 369,000 annual pace last month, missing the
385,000 median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Americans bought a revised 398,000 new properties in November.  Business Sentiment  In  Europe , a measure of German business confidence rose in
January more than economists had predicted. The Ifo institute’s
business-climate index, which is based on a survey of 7,000
executives, climbed to 104.2 this month from 102.4 in December.
That exceeded the  median forecast of economists  surveyed in a
Bloomberg survey for a reading of 103.  The  European Central Bank  said that banks will repay 137
billion euros ($184 billion) of three-year loans on Jan. 30,
their first opportunity to return the funds. Economists surveyed
by Bloomberg had predicted that the banks would initially pay
back 84 billion euros. The ECB made available 1 trillion euros
of loans, through its Longer Term Refinancing Operations, in two
tranches a year ago.  The volume of shares changing hands on SMI-listed companies
was 2.5 percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Novartis, Transocean  Novartis AG (NOVN)  lost 0.7 percent to 62.15 francs after Europe’s
biggest drugmaker said in a regulatory filing that federal
prosecutors sent a subpoena to its U.S. unit. They sought
documents on the company’s sales practices, including payments
to health-care providers, for the hypertension medicine
Tekturna, Novartis said in  a statement .  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  declined 0.5 percent to 203.50 francs.
Transocean slipped 0.9 percent to 51.90 francs.  SGS SA (SGSN)  advanced 1 percent to 2,196 francs after Exane BNP
Paribas SA increased its forecast for the shares by 7 percent to
2,300 francs. The brokerage said that margins at the world’s
largest product inspector will probably climb in 2013.  Nestle SA (NESN) , which accounts for 23 percent of  the SMI , gained
0.9 percent to 64.10 francs.  Mondobiotech Holding AG surged 38 percent to 22 centimes,
its highest price in six months after saying it will merge with
Italian pharmaceutical-services company Pierrel SpA.  DKSH Holding AG (DKSH) , which helps its clients expand into Asian
markets, advanced 2.1 percent to 72.40 francs after saying it
acquired South Korean medical-device distributor Miraecare.  To contact the reporter on this story:
