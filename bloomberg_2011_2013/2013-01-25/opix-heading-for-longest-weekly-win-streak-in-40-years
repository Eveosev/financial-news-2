Japanese  stocks  gained, with the
 Topix (TPX)  Index posting its longest weekly winning streak since
1973, as the yen weakened after falling consumer prices added to
the case for further easing and U.S jobless claims fell.  Toyota (7203)  Motor Corp. advanced 2.2 percent after a steel
supplier gave the world’s biggest carmaker a discount. Sony
Corp. surged 8.5 percent on a report it may sell its lithium
battery operations.  Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. (4506)  has surged 29
percent over two days on yesterday’s NHK report it will apply

precision motors cut its full-year profit forecast.  The Topix rose 2.2 percent to 917.09 at the close of
trading in  Tokyo , its highest level since before the March 2011

longest such winning streak since January 1973. The  Nikkei 225 (NKY) 
Stock Average gained 2.9 percent to 10,926.65.  “Investors are becoming more optimistic about the earnings
prospects for Japanese exporters with the yen weakening so
much,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , chief strategist at Toyota Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $20 billion. “Good
economic data out of the U.S., as well as the hope placed in
policy makers’ monetary easing measures,” are boosting shares.  The Topix has risen 27 percent since elections were
announced on Nov. 14 on optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s new
government will take steps to fight deflation. The gauge is
trading at 1.08 times  book value , compared with 2.06 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.49 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index.  Consumer Prices  Japan ’s consumer prices declined for the sixth time in
seven months in December, adding impetus for the  Bank of Japan 
to reach an inflation goal announced this week. Consumer prices
excluding fresh food fell 0.2 percent, the statistics bureau
said in Tokyo today, matching the estimate of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  “The 2 percent inflation target set by the Bank of Japan
is exceedingly high, and with the CPI down 0.2 percent, there’s
strong expectation for further monetary easing steps,” said
Tamiji Shinada, executive director of investment research at
Nomura Securities Co. in Tokyo.  Exporters gained as the yen weakened against the dollar,
poised for a record 11-week stretch of losses. Nissan Motor Co.,
a carmaker that counts  North America  as its biggest market, rose
2.6 percent to 874 yen.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , the producer of Viera
televisions, increased 2.7 percent to 604 yen.  Toyota Climbs  Toyota, which gets a quarter of its sales from North

newspaper reported today, without citing anyone. Nippon Steel
gained 2.2 percent to 233 yen.  Sony advanced 8.5 percent to 1,290 yen, its highest close
since April. The company may sell its lithium battery unit to a
venture between NEC Corp. and Nissan, the Yomiuri newspaper
reported, citing unidentified people.  Sony (6758)  said it wasn’t the
source of the report.  Dainippon Sumitomo gained 12 percent to 1,416 yen, the
 biggest gain  on the Nikkei 225 and extending yesterday’s 16
percent jump. The company may apply for clinical trials in Japan
for the world’s first drug to target cancer stem cells, national
broadcaster NHK reported yesterday. Shares pared gains after a
Jefferies Group Inc. analyst said investors were “overly
excited” because the NHK report had no new content.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slid 0.2 percent today. Most U.S.
stocks rose yesterday as an unexpected drop in jobless claims
and better-than-forecast earnings from Netflix Inc. and Xerox

The motor maker yesterday cut its full-year net-income forecast
by 91 percent to 4.5 billion yen, citing lower demand and
restructuring costs. The stock was the biggest drag on the
Topix.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 4 percent to
22.19, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.4 percent on
the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
