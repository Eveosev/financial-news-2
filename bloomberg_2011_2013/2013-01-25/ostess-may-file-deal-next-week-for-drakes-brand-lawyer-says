Hostess Brands Inc., the bankrupt
maker of Twinkies snack cakes and Wonder Bread, hopes to file a
“stalking-horse” agreement for the  Drakes  brand next week, a
lawyer for the bakery company said.  The statement came at a court hearing today at which
Hostess is seeking permission to sell the majority of its bread
brand assets and Beefsteak brand at a Feb. 28 auction.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain in White Plains, New
York, is being asked to approve bidding procedures and terms
including a disputed $13.65 million breakup fee  Flowers Foods
Inc. (FLO)  will get if it isn’t the winner.  Flowers is offering to buy 20 bread plants, 38 depots and
other assets for $355 million, which may be increased to
$360 million if certain license rights are included in the sale.
Flowers also agreed to purchase the Beefsteak bread brand for
$30 million.  Drain today approved a March 28 deadline for former workers
to file claims for back pay, severance and the like.  Hostess, based in Irving,  Texas , sought court protection in
January 2012, listing assets of $982 million and debt of
$1.43 billion, after years of declining sales as consumers
switched to more healthful foods amid increases in labor and
supply costs.  The case is In re Hostess Brands Inc., 12-22052, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (White Plains).  To contact the reporter on this story:
