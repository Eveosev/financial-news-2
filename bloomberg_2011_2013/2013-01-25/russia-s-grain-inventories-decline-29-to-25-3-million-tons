Grain stockpiles in Russia, last
season’s third-biggest  wheat exporter , fell 29 percent from a
year earlier as of Jan. 1, government statistics showed.  Inventories were 25.3 million metric tons, against 35.9
million tons a year earlier, the Moscow-based Federal State
Statistics Service said today in an e-mailed statement. Leading
agricultural producers held stockpiles of 13.4 million tons,
while procurement and milling companies had 11.9 million tons,
compared with respective year-earlier levels of 19.6 million
tons and 16.3 million tons.  Procurement firms and millers had about 7.8 million tons of
stockpiled wheat, of which 6.3 million tons was of milling
quality, said Rosstat, as the service is known. That was down
from about 12 million tons a year earlier, including 9.5 million
tons of milling wheat.  Inventories fell 6.1 percent from a year earlier to about
6.7 million tons in the Central Federal District and slid almost
35 percent to about 6.2 million tons in the Volga Federal
District. Stockpiles dropped about 37 percent to 3.6 million
tons in the Southern Federal District and plunged about 48
percent to 1.3 million tons in the North Caucasus Federal
Ddistrict, which are the closest to  Russia ’s main export routes.  Rosstat’s figures exclude small private farms and household
reserves.  Wheat for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $7.6675 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 3:03 p.m. Moscow time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
