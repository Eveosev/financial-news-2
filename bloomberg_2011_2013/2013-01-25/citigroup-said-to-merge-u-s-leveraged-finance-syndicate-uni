Citigroup Inc. (C)  is combining its
leveraged finance origination and syndication businesses in the
U.S., according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The new unit will be managed by Tom Cole, co-head of U.S.
leveraged finance, and John McAuley, who formerly headed the
high-yield debt distribution group for North America at the
third-biggest U.S. lender, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the changes haven’t been announced publicly.  Barbara Matas, co-head of U.S. leveraged finance, was named
chairwoman of the newly combined group, the people said. The
changes, which were announced internally yesterday, are
effective immediately.  William Hughes will continue to lead loan syndication and
was named global head of a newly-formed leveraged finance
portfolio group, the people said. That team will manage
Citigroup’s holdings of high-yield loans, working with the
firm’s banking, risk and capital markets origination
departments, the people said.  Robert Julavits, a Citigroup spokesman, declined to
comment.  Citigroup was the sixth-largest underwriter of leveraged
loans in the U.S. in 2012, arranging $38.1 billion of the debt,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranked third in U.S.
high-yield bond underwriting last year with $33.8 billion,
according to the data.  Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are those rated below
BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s (MHP)  and less than Baa3 at  Moody’s
Investors Service. (MCO)   To contact the reporter on this story:
