An Egyptian court has decided
against moving to Cairo the defendants charged in last year’s
Port Said stadium riots because of security concerns linked to a
verdict in the case, the Ahram Gate website reported,  The  Interior Ministry  is also planning on boosting security
around the police academy on Cairo’s outskirts where the hearing
is scheduled to be held, the state-run news website reported,
citing an unidentified Interior Ministry official.  The announcement came as protesters, including soccer fans
known as Ultras, clashed with security forces today, the second
anniversary of the start of the 2011 uprising that pushed  Hosni Mubarak  from power. The Ultras have been demanding justice for
the more than 70 fans killed in the stadium riot during a match
between the rival al-Ahly and al-Masri clubs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
