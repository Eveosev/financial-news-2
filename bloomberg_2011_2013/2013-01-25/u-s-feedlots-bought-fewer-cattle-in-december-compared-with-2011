U.S. feedlots bought 0.5 percent
fewer cattle in December compared with a year earlier, the
government said, surprising analysts who were expecting an
increase.  Feedlots bought 1.664 million head of cattle last month,
down from 1.673 million in December 2011, the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said today in a report. The average estimate of 12
analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News  was a 2.9 percent increase.
The feedlot herd totaled 11.193 million as of Jan. 1, 5.6
percent less from a year earlier. Analysts expected the
inventory to be down 4.6 percent.  Most analysts predicted an increase in feedlot purchases,
as the country’s worst drought since the 1930s dried out
pastures in the Great Plains, prompting some ranchers to sell
off young animals earlier than usual. About 27 percent of the
High Plains region was in “exceptional”  drought  as of Jan. 22,
the U.S. Drought Monitor shows, up from 0.1 percent a year
earlier.  Feedlot operators buy year-old animals that weigh 500
pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The cattle
are fattened on corn for about four to five months until they
weigh about 1,200 pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.745 million animals to meatpackers
last month, down 1.7 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected 6.6 percent drop, on average.  Fattened cattle futures for April delivery climbed 0.3
percent to $1.308 a pound at 12:54 p.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price fell 1.5 percent in January
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement were little
changed at $1.47975 a pound, and the commodity lost 4.1 percent
this month through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
