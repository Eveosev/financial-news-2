First Pacific Co. (142) , the Asian
utilities and resources company controlled by billionaire
Anthoni Salim, plans to sign a $200 million, three-year  term
loan  with five banks as early as this week after increasing the
facility’s size from $150 million, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  The so-called club loan won’t be marketed to other banks in
syndication and pays a margin of 180 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate and fees of 175 basis points for
an all-in rate of about 238 basis points, the person said,
asking not to be identified because the details are private.  Proceeds will be used to refinance debt and for general
corporate purposes, the person said. Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co., the country’s biggest phone company, is a unit of
First Pacific. The company also controls Philex Mining Corp.,
the  Philippines ’ largest metals producer, and Metro Pacific
Investments Corp., which has assets in the power, water, toll-
road and health care sectors, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Metropolitan Bank & Trust pledged $50 million to the loan
while Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.
and Bank of the Philippine Islands lent $40 million each, the
person said. China Banking Corp. lent $30 million, the person
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
