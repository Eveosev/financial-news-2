Former U.S. Treasury Secretary
 Lawrence Summers  said he’s more upbeat about the  U.S. economy 
than at any time in the past five years.  “I’m very encouraged by the statistics of the last few
months,” Summers said at a conference in Washington today held
by The Atlantic. “I’m more encouraged than I’ve been any time
in the last five years about the situation of the American
economy, though there are no certainties.”  Summers, 57, Treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 under
President Bill Clinton and director of the National Economic
Council under President Barack Obama in 2009 and 2010, is said
to be a possible candidate to lead the World Bank.  Summers also said an overhaul of the U.S. tax code “should
be at the top of the national agenda” for whoever wins the
November presidential election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
