Nation Media Group Ltd. (NMG)  of  Kenya ,
East Africa’s biggest publishing company, said full-year profit
jumped 30 percent as advertising revenue climbed and the
circulation of its newspapers increased.  Net income grew to 2 billion shillings ($24 million) or
12.7 shillings per share in the 12 months through December, from
1.54 billion shillings or 9.8 shillings per share a year
earlier, Chief Executive Officer Linus Gitahi told reporters
today in Nairobi, the capital.  The increase was due to “revenue growth, market share
gains and continued innovation and greater contribution by the
regional subsidiaries,” Gitahi said. Sales rose 18 percent to
11.2 billion shillings.  NMG, as the company is known, intends to have a “fully-
fledged” news bureau in  South Sudan  within the next two months
and plans to operate a television station in Tanzania upon
receiving frequencies from the local regulator, he said.  The company will also venture into the money-transfer
business in partnership with  Diamond Trust Bank Ltd. (DTKL) , Gitahi
said. The service will be based on the company’s website, he
said.  NMG will pay a dividend of 8 shillings, up from 5.50
shillings last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
