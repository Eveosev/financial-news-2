Mike D’Antoni  is out as coach of
the  New York Knicks  amid a six-game losing streak and locker-
room bickering, a person with knowledge of the situation said.  The person was granted anonymity because he wasn’t
authorized to discuss it.  Barry Watkins, a spokesman for Madison Square Garden Co.,
which owns the Knicks, declined to comment on D’Antoni in an e-
mail. Yahoo! Inc.’s website reported today that D’Antoni left in
a mutual decision with team owner James Dolan.  The departure came hours after the New York Post said that
All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony wanted to be traded by
tomorrow’s  National Basketball Association  deadline and had
created a rift with D’Antoni. Anthony responded on Twitter
today, saying he didn’t want to be traded and told reporters at
practice that he supported the coach.  It also comes less than a month after the Knicks, with
Anthony sidelined by injuries and Jeremy Lin taking over as
their point guard, had become the toast of the NBA by winning
seven games in a row.  To contact the reporter on this story:
