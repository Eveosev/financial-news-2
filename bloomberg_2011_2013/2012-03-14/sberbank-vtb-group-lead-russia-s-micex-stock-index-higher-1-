OAO Sberbank and VTB Group,
 Russia ’s biggest lenders, led gains on the country’s benchmark
stock index after the  Federal Reserve  spurred confidence in the
U.S. banking system and raised its economic assessment, stoking
demand for riskier assets globally.  Sberbank, which has the biggest weighting in the Micex at
15 percent, added 2.7 percent to 103.26 rubles by the close in
Moscow, its best rally since Feb. 24. VTB, with a 3.4 percent
weighting, gained 1.9 percent to 7.328 kopeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
