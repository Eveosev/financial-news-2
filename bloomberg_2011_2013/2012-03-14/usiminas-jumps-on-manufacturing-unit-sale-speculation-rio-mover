Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA ,  Brazil ’s second-largest steelmaker, rose to a highest in
almost seven months on speculation the company may sell
manufacturing subsidiaries and use the cash to develop its
mining business.  Usiminas, as the Belo Horizonte, Brazil-based company is
known,  climbed  5.3 percent to 13.39 reais in  Sao Paulo  today,
its highest since Aug. 23. It was the best performer on the
benchmark Bovespa index, which dropped 0.2 percent.  The company may resume plans to sell its subsidiaries
 Usiminas Mecanica  and Automotiva Usiminas, O Estado de S. Paulo
 reported , citing an unidentified person close to the company’s
administration. The units may be worth 2.5 billion reais ($1.4
billion), and the money would be used to invest in the company’s
mining business, according to the newspaper.  “This possible sale would reinforce the cash position of
Usiminas,” William Castro Alves, an analyst at brokerage XP
Investimentos, said in a telephone interview from  Rio de
Janeiro . “It would free up resources to develop the mining
business better, which has saved the company’s day recently.”  Usiminas Mecanica makes capital goods for steel structures,
bridges, railway cars and other industries, the company said in
a recent regulatory filing. Automotiva Usiminas manufactures
auto parts.  An Usiminas official in  Belo Horizonte  said the company
won’t comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  Shares of Usiminas rose 32 percent this year, beating the
Bovespa’s 20 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
