Crude oil options volatility fell
for a sixth consecutive session as underlying futures remained
within a three-week trading range.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, sank to 26.5 percent as of 3 p.m. in  New
York , down from 26.7 percent yesterday.  “The market has been in a tight range since coming off its
highs after the run-up with the  Iran  fears,” said Vince Lanci,
managing partner of Echobay Partners LLC, a commodity investment
firm in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Crude for April delivery fell $1.28, or 1.2 percent, to
settle at $105.43 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
The May contract declined $1.29 to $105.95. Since Feb. 21, the
front-month contract has traded in a range of $104.26 to
$110.55.  Futures have risen 6.7 percent this year on concern that
Iran’s development of a nuclear program would result in supply
disruptions.  “The market doesn’t have directional momentum now and you
can see that by the options trade,” said  Gene McGillian , an
analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $70 puts, with 6,311 lots changing hands as of 3:11 p.m.
They fell 1 cent to 4 cents a barrel. April $108 calls, the
second-most active options, declined 34 cents to 6 cents with
4,272 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 58 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Previous Session
|  Bearish options accounted for 51 percent of the 115,426
trades from the previous session. April $100 calls were the most
actively traded, with 5,056 lots changing hands as they fell 2
