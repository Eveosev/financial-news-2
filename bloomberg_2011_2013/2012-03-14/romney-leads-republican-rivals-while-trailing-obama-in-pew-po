As  Mitt Romney  and Rick Santorum
battle for the Republican presidential nomination, President
 Barack Obama  leads both candidates, according to a poll released
today.  The survey by the Pew Research Center for the People & the
Press also found Obama’s approval rating reaching 50 percent for
the first time in 10 months, shortly after U.S. troops killed
the terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.  The March 7-11 poll gave Obama a 54 percent to 42 percent
lead over Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, and a 57
percent to 39 percent edge over Santorum, a former U.S. senator
from  Pennsylvania . The survey of 1,503 adults had a margin of
error of 3 percentage points overall and 5 percentage points for
subsets of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters.  Last month, Obama led Romney, 52 percent to 44 percent, and
Santorum, 53 percent to 43 percent. Almost 60 percent of
registered voters, including 30 percent of Republicans and those
leaning toward the party, said they expected Obama to beat
Romney; more than two-thirds, including 43 percent of
Republicans and leaners, predicted an Obama win over Santorum.  The poll, taken before Santorum’s victories in Alabama and
Mississippi yesterday, showed Romney ahead in the race for his
party’s presidential nomination even as two-thirds of
Republicans and leaners said they preferred someone else. Romney
garnered 33 percent, up from 28 percent in February, while
Santorum dropped to 24 percent in March from 30 percent last
month.  Gingrich and Paul  Former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  polled 20 percent,
an increase from 17 percent in February, and U.S. Representative
 Ron Paul  of  Texas  placed fourth at 14 percent, up from 12
percent a month earlier.  Obama’s job approval rating climbed to 50 percent for the
first time since May 2010, with 41 percent disapproving of his
performance. In January, 48 percent disapproved of his job
performance while 41 percent approved.  His rating on economic issues also rose, with 43 percent
approving of the way he was handing the economy, up from 35
percent in November. Still, 53 percent disapproved, though that
was better than his 58 percent disapproval rating in November.  The poll also found 44 percent of respondents saying that
the economy would be better a year from now, the same as in
February and up from 28 percent in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
