Iraq â€™s Oil Ministry will issue the
final draft contracts for the next round of energy-exploration
rights on April 20, the director-general of the licensing
department said.  Companies that were preselected to bid in the two-day May
30 licensing round have until tomorrow to comment on the
preliminary drafts, Abdul Mahdy al-Ameedi said in an interview
in Baghdad today.  The licensing round has been repeatedly delayed to allow
more time for companies to make remarks and changes so that the
agreements are more attractive for investments.  Iraq has awarded 15 oil and natural-gas licenses to foreign
companies since the U.S.-led invasion that ousted President
 Saddam Hussein  in 2003. The Arab nation is the third-largest oil
producer in OPEC and seeks to develop natural gas to help
generate electricity.  Iraq is auctioning 12 exploration areas, seven for oil and
five for gas, according to the ministry. They contain 29 billion
cubic meters of gas and 10 billion barrels of crude, Oil
Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said in March. Forty-six
companies have qualified for the bidding, including  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  BP Plc (BP/) , and Total SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
