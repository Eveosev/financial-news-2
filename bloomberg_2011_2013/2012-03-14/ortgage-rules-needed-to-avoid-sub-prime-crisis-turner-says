Tougher rules on mortgage lending
will rein in the type of practices that led to the U.S. sub-
prime crisis,  Adair Turner , chairman of the Financial Services
Authority, said today.  The review of the mortgage market, which will restrict
interest-only and self-certified mortgages, will stop banks
relying on rising property prices to balance the risk that a
borrower might not repay their loan, Turner told lawmakers in
London today.  The practice “was the absolute core of the U.S. sub-prime
disaster,” Turner said.  The FSA has proposed plans to reform the U.K.’s 1.2
trillion-pound ($1.89 trillion) mortgage market, arguing some
practices exacerbated the banking crisis that followed the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008. The watchdog
is seeking views on the proposals for the  seventh time  since the
review began in 2009. The full set of proposals will be
implemented in 2013.  The regulations require lenders to assess the impact of
rising interest rates in mortgage-approval calculations and ban
interest-only mortgages in cases where the borrower would have
to rely on rising house prices to repay the loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
