Overseas  investors  bought a net
 9.07 billion rupees  ($182 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
taking total investments in equities this year to 404.8 billion
rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 27.6 billion rupees of shares and sold
18.5 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. They poured 252.1 billion rupees in
February, helping the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  to its second
straight monthly gain for the first time since September 2010.  Offshore investors sold a net 2.26 billion rupees of debt,
reducing flows into bonds this year to 238.6 billion rupees, the
data  show . They put 421 billion rupees in bonds in 2011.  Foreigners have invested 4.849 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.446 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.3 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from abroad. Inflows surged to a record
in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the world’s
top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led to the
biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the BSE India Sensitive Index, the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
