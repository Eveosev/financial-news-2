Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
won U.S. approval to sell the first generic version of Lexapro
for depression and anxiety.  Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker, will have 180
days to exclusively sell the copy of the medicine, the  Food and
Drug Administration  said today in a  statement . Lexapro is  Forest
Laboratories Inc. (FRX) ’s top-seller, with $2.3 billion in sales for
the fiscal year ended in March 2011.  “This medication is widely used by people who must manage
their condition over time, so it is important to have affordable
treatment options,” said  Janet Woodcock , director of the FDA’s
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.  Teva’s American depositary receipts fell 1.4 percent to
$43.80 at the close of New York trading. Each receipt is equal
to one ordinary share of the Petach Tikva, Israel-based company.
New York-based Forest declined less than 1 percent to $33.69.  Both psychiatric conditions can be disabling and interfere
with daily activities, Woodcock said. Major depression symptoms
include loss of interest in usual activities, significant weight
change, insomnia or excessive sleeping and suicidal thoughts.
People with anxiety disorder worry excessively and have
difficulty concentrating, according to the FDA.  The most common side effects with the drug were
sleeplessness, ejaculation disorder, nausea, increase in
sweating, fatigue, drowsiness and low sex drive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
