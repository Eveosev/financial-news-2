American skier  Lindsey Vonn  is
closing in on the World Cup point record set by Austria’s
Hermann Maier after winning the downhill in Schladming.  Vonn, 27, won her fifth downhill of the season at the World
Cup Finals in Austria in a time of  1 minute, 46.56 seconds ,
almost one second ahead of  France ’s Marion Rolland and 1.22
seconds faster than Tina Maze of Slovenia.  The American is now  92 points short  of tying Maier’s World
Cup record of 2,000 set 12 years ago. Vonn, who has already
clinched the overall season title, will ski three more events
this week in Schladming, each worth 100 points. She’s 62 points
shy of the women’s record of 1,970 points set by Janica Kostelic
of  Croatia  in 2006.  After losing last year’s overall title to  Germany ’s Maria
Hoefl-Riesch by  three points , Vonn has dominated the ski circuit
this season. Today’s win was her 12th World Cup victory this
winter, and takes her total tally to 53. Last week, she became
the first American to win four overall World Cup skiing titles
by taking the giant slalom race in Are, Sweden.  Earlier today, Norway’s Aksel Lund Svindal won the final
downhill race of the year after he  finished  more than half a
second ahead of Beat Feuz of Switzerland. Austria’s Hannes
Reichelt came in third. Austria’s  Klaus Kroell  took the overall
downhill title for the 2011-12 season with 605 points after
finishing seventh in today’s race. Feuz leads the men’s overall
 season standings .  To contact the reporter on this story:
