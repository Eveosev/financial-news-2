Kenya’s  All-Share Index (NSEASI)  fell for

at the close. The  Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index (NGSEINDX)  rose

excluding  South Africa . Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL)  , sub-Saharan Africa’s third-
biggest airline, plunged 9.9 percent to 15.1 shillings, the
lowest since October 2004. The company said March 12 it plans to
raise $3.6 billion, partly through a rights offer and loans, to
fund its 10-year expansion plan.  Nestle Nigeria Plc (NESTLE)  , the West African nation’s
largest food company by market value, dropped by the daily limit
of 5 percent to 462.37 naira, the biggest drop since Jan. 3, as
investors bet a recent rally in the stock was overdone.  “A lot of investors are selling so the demand is not
strong enough to hold the price at that bullish level,” David
Adonri, Chief Executive Officer of Lambeth Trust and Investment
Co., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
