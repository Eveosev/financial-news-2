The Bank of Mauritius’s monetary
policy committee will probably cut the benchmark  interest rate 
at its March 19 meeting, a survey by PluriConseil showed.  Out of 30 analysts, 20 expect a reduction in the rate, the
Mauritian research company said in a survey published in the
Port Louis-based l’Express newspaper today, with 13 forecasting
a cut between 0.1 percent to 0.25 percent and 7 expecting a 0.3
percent to 0.5 percent drop. The remaining 10 analysts forecast
no change in the rate.  The monetary policy committee cut the repo rate by 0.1
percent to 5.4 percent in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
