Taylor, Bean & Whitaker Mortgage
Corp.’s former finance chief reached a plea agreement with
federal prosecutors, almost a year after the company’s chairman
was found guilty of running a $3 billion fraud.  Delton de Armas is scheduled to appear in court for a plea
hearing on March 20, according to a filing today in U.S.
District Court in Alexandria, Virginia. The court’s docket
doesn’t say what de Armas is being charged with.  Peter Carr , a spokesman for U.S. Attorney  Neil MacBride ,
declined to comment on the filing. De Armas couldn’t be located
for comment.  Lee Farkas , the ex-chairman of Taylor Bean, is serving a
30-year sentence after being convicted in April of 14 counts of
conspiracy and bank, wire and securities fraud in what
prosecutors said was a $3 billion scheme involving fake mortgage
assets.  Six conspirators to the fraud scheme who pleaded guilty and
testified against Farkas at trial were sentenced to prison terms
ranging from three months to eight years.  Taylor Bean, based in Ocala, Florida, was servicing more
than 500,000 mortgages, including $51 billion of Freddie Mac
loans, when it collapsed in August 2009, according to court
records.  The case is U.S. v. Armas, 12-00096, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of  Virginia  (Alexandria).  To contact the reporter on this story:
