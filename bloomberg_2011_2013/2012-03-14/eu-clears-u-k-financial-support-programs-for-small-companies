The European Union has approved two
U.K. financial support programs for small businesses saying
they are compatible with the region’s rules on state aid.  The measures, the so-called National Loan Guarantee Scheme,
and the Business Finance Partnership, won’t give unfair
advantages to participating companies or banks, the European
Commission said in an emailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
