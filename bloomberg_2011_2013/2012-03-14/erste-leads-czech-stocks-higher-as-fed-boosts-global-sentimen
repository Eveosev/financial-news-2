Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  of Austria led
a rally in Czech shares after the  Federal Reserve  bolstered
confidence in the U.S. banking system and raised its economic
assessment, boosting demand for risker assets worldwide.  The stock rose 2.3 percent to 462.50 koruna by 12:18 p.m.
in Prague, extending this yearâ€™s advance to 34 percent. The 14-
member  PX (PX)  equity gauge, where Erste has a more than 20 percent
weighting, rose 0.9 percent, a second day of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
