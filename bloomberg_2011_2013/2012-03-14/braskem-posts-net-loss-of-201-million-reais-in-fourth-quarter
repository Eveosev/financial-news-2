Braskem SA (BRKM5) ,  Latin America ’s largest
petrochemicals maker, posted a larger-than-expected quarterly
loss after raw-material costs surged and sales volumes fell.  The loss of 201 million reais ($111 million), or 25
centavos a share, compares with net income of 356 million reais,
or 45 centavos, in the year-earlier period, Sao Paulo-based
Braskem said in a regulatory filing today. The company was
 expected  to post a loss of 61.3 million reais, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  Competition from increasing imports meant domestic sales
volumes dropped 12 percent for thermoplastic polymers known as
polyolefins and 6 percent for PVC, a polymer used to make pipes,
Braskem said. Costs jumped 39 percent in the quarter to 8.02
billion reais.  “Imports remain pretty high, reducing local producers’
competitiveness,” Paula Kovarsky, an equity analyst at Itau
Unibanco Holdings SA, said in a March 7 report. She rates the
stock “market perform.”  Net revenue increased 25 percent to 8.71 billion reais in
the quarter, up from 6.97 billion reais last year, Braskem said.  Braskem rose 1.5 percent to 15.67 reais yesterday in  Sao
Paulo  and has climbed 22 percent this year, more than a 21
percent gain for the benchmark Bovespa index. Earnings were
announced before the opening of the stock market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
