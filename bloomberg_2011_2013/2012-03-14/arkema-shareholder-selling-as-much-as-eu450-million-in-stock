Arkema SA (AKE)  investor  Groupe Bruxelles
Lambert SA (GBLB)  is offering 6.2 million shares of the company for as
much as 450 million euros ($589 million).  The shares are being sold for about 69.90 euros to the
market price, or 72.61 euros as of yesterday’s close, according
to a term sheet.  Bank of America Corp.  and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  are
handling the sale.  “We’re working on organic growth, new capacity expansion
and acquisitions to help us move forward faster,” Chief
Executive Officer Thierry Le Henaff said in a conference call
March 8. The Colombes, France-based manufacturer of generic and
brand-name chemicals has completed the integration of its
purchase of Total SA’s specialty resins business, he said.  Arkema posted a loss of 19 million euros in 2011, compared
with net income of 347 million euros in 2010, according to a
regulatory  filing . Cash and cash equivalents fell to 252 million
euros in the same period, from 527 million. The stock has risen
25 percent since the company reported earnings March 8. Groupe
Bruxelles rose 1.1 percent to 56.66 euros yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
