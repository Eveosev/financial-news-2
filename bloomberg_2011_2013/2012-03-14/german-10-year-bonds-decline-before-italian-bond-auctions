German bunds fell, driving up
yields by the most in three months, after Federal Reserve policy
makers raised their assessment of the  U.S. economy , damping
demand for the euro-region’s safest assets.  German 10-year bunds underperformed all their euro-region
peers, with yields on  Europe ’s benchmark securities rising to
the  highest  in almost three weeks. Italy’s bonds rose as the
nation’s three-year borrowing costs fell to a 17-month low at a
debt sale today. Greek debt advanced after the nation’s credit
grade was raised by  Fitch Ratings .  “Bunds traded lower as the market’s taken heart from the
Fed statement,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income strategist at
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets in London. “It was sufficient to
give the market the confidence it needed.”  The German 10-year yield climbed 14 basis points to 1.96
percent at 4:44 p.m.  London  time, the highest rate since Feb.
22. The 2 percent bond due January 2022 dropped 1.215, or 12.15
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,303) face amount, to 100.375.  German 10-year rates may rise toward 2 percent, Wand said.
“Two percent to 2.05 percent is the upper end of the yield
range, so that will be key” to near-term direction, he said.  Volatility in German debt was the second highest in euro-
area markets today, after Dutch securities, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps. Two-year German yields increased six basis
points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 0.24 percent.  Bonds Slump  Bonds slumped from  Germany  to the U.S. after Fed policy
makers said yesterday they expect “moderate economic growth,”
rather than the “modest” expansion they described in their
previous statement. Unemployment will “decline gradually” and
the inflation outlook is “subdued,” the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said.  The yield on  benchmark  10-year U.S Treasuries advanced as
much as 12 basis points today to 2.25 percent, the highest since
Oct. 31. U.K. 10-year gilt  yields  reached 2.35 percent, the
highest since Dec. 6.  Italy sold 5 billion euros of 2.5 percent notes due March
2015, with borrowing costs falling to 2.76 percent, the lowest
since October 2010. Demand was 1.56 times the amount sold,
compared with 1.40 times last month. The Rome-based Treasury
also sold 1 billion euros of seven-year bonds at 4.3 percent,
meeting the 6 billion-euro maximum set for the sale.  Italian Rally  “Italy has rallied in the first quarter,” said Peter Goves, a fixed-income strategist at Citigroup Inc. in London.
“It’s difficult to see a significant negative driver in the
peripheral bond markets in the immediate term,”  The Italian  10-year (GBTPGR10)  bond yield fell four basis points to
4.86 percent, reducing the extra yield investors get for holding
the securities instead of benchmark German bunds by 18 basis
points to 2.9 percentage points. The Spanish-German yield spread
narrowed nine basis points to 322 basis points.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised investors to buy five-year
Italian notes against their Spanish equivalents.  “There is still value in euro-area peripheral bond
markets,” Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of fixed-income
strategy in London, wrote in an e-mailed report today. “Italy
should continue to outperform  Spain .”  Investors should bet that Italian five-year note yields
fall to 50 basis points below their Spanish equivalents,
Garzarelli said. They should end the trade if the note yield
climbs to 25 basis points more than Spanish rates. The
difference, or  spread , was at 19 basis points today.  Spanish Sale  Spain is scheduled to sell securities maturing in 2015,
2016 and 2018 tomorrow, while  France  plans to auction notes due
in April 2014 and October 2014, as well as bonds maturing in
February 2016 and February 2017.  Greek government bonds due in February 2023 advanced after
Fitch said the nation’s debt swap will reduce the risk of the
country reneging on its obligations. The nation was raised four
levels to B- from restricted default and given a stable outlook.  The yield on the 2023 securities fell 74 basis points to
18.28 percent. The rate on the nation’s bond maturing in
February 2042 was little changed at 14.21 percent.  German bunds are little changed this year after returning
9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Italian bonds have advanced 13 percent since Dec. 31, while
Spanish debt returned 2.2 percent, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
