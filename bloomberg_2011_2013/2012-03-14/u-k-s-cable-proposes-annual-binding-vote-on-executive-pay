U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
backed allowing shareholders a greater say over executive pay,
including annual votes on compensation and binding votes on exit
payments.  Cable said he will seek views on the plan before the
lawmakers vote on the proposals, which were announced in
January. Today’s announcement also includes plans to get an
annual “advisory” vote on pay in the previous year and
increasing the number of votes needed to approve pay.  “These measures will create a more robust framework within
which executive pay is set, agreed and reported on,” Cable said
in a written statement to Parliament today.  In January, Cable said the government will seek to give
shareholders a binding vote on the amount paid to executives 
when they leave a company. The largest public companies should
publish clear details of how much their highest-paid executives
get, along with information about average salaries within the
companies.  The  High Pay Commission , an independent group that pushes
for curbs on top earners, found British directors’ salaries
increased by 64 percent over the past decade, while the average
year-end share price of  FTSE 100 companies  fell 71 percent. The
average annual bonus for directors rose 187 percent, according
to the panel.  In the U.S., the Dodd-Frank Act has given shareholders a
non-binding vote on top executive pay since January 2011. In
August, compensation experts said companies whose policies got a
vote below about 80 percent were taking it as a sign of
shareholder discontent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
