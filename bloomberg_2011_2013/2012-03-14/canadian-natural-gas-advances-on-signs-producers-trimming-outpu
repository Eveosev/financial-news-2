Canadian natural gas rose amid
signs that producers are drilling less and shutting some wells
to ease a glut of the fuel.  Alberta  gas for April delivery gained 3 percent. The U.S.
gas rig count dropped to 670 last week, a 32-month low,
according to data compiled by  Baker Hughes Inc (BAKEGAS) . Encana Corp. and
Talisman Energy Inc., two of  Canada ’s largest gas producers,
said they will shut some gas production and shift exploration
efforts to oil and natural-gas liquids.  “Horizontal gas drilling is now down 31 percent from its
mid-October peak,” said Stephen Smith, an energy analyst and
president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in Natchez,
 Mississippi . “This will have a significant impact on gas
production in the second half of 2012.”  Alberta gas for April delivery gained 5.25 cents to C$1.80
a gigajoule ($1.71 per million British thermal units) as of 3:30
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 1.5 cents to settle at $2.284 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
1.16 cents to $2.047 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas gained 2.19 cents to $2.0122 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas fell 4.85 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.0347.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 169 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.81 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.14 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 656 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 2 billion cubic feet today, or 75 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.06
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
