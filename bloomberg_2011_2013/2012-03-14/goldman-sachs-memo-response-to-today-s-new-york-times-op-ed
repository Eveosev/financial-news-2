(The following is an internal memo to  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
employees from Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and
Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn. A copy of the memo was
obtained by Bloomberg News. Its contents were confirmed by  David
Wells , a company spokesman in  New York .)  March 14, 2012  Our Response to Today’s New York Times Op-Ed  By now, many of you have read the submission in today’s New York
Times by a former employee of the firm.  Needless to say, we
were disappointed to read the assertions made by this individual
that do not reflect our values, our culture
and how the vast majority of people at Goldman Sachs think about
the firm and the work it does on behalf of our clients.  In a company of our size, it is not shocking that some people
could feel disgruntled.  But that does not and should not
represent our firm of more than 30,000 people. Everyone is
entitled to his or her opinion.  But, it is unfortunate that an
individual opinion about Goldman Sachs is amplified in a
newspaper and speaks louder than the regular, detailed and
intensive feedback you have provided the firm and independent,
public surveys of workplace environments.  While I expect you find the words you read today foreign from
your own day-to-day experiences, we wanted to remind you what
we, as a firm - individually and collectively - think about
Goldman Sachs and our client-driven culture.  First, 85 percent of the firm responded to our recent People
Survey, which provides the most detailed and comprehensive
review to determine how our people feel about Goldman Sachs and
the work they do.  And, what do our people think about how we interact with our
clients?  Across the firm at all levels, 89 percent of you said
that that the firm provides exceptional service to them.  For
the group of nearly 12,000 vice presidents, of which the author
of today’s commentary was, that number was similarly high.  Anyone who feels otherwise has available to him or her a
mechanism for anonymously expressing their concerns.  We are not
aware that the writer of the opinion piece expressed misgivings
through this avenue, however, if an individual expresses issues,
we examine them carefully and we will be doing so in this case.  Our firm has had its share of challenges during and after the
financial crisis, but your pride in Goldman Sachs is clear.
You’ve not only told us, you have told external surveys.  Just two weeks ago, Goldman Sachs was named one of the best
places to work in the  United Kingdom , where this employee
resides.  The firm was the highest placed financial services
company for the third consecutive year and was the only one in
its peer group to make the top 25.  We are far from perfect, but where the firm has seen a problem,
we’ve responded to it seriously and substantively.  And we have
demonstrated that fact.  It is unfortunate that all of you who worked so hard through a
difficult environment over the last few years now have to
respond to this. But, our response is best demonstrated in how
we really work with and help our clients through our commitment
to their long-term interests.  That priority has
distinguished us in the past, through the financial crisis and
today.  Thank you.  Lloyd C. Blankfein
