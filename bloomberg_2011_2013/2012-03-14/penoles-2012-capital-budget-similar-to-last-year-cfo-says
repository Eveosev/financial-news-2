Industrias Penoles SAB (PE&OLES*) , the world’s
largest producer of refined silver, will spend about the same on
capital expenses this year as it did in 2011 as it seeks to
boost production and reduce energy costs.  Penoles’s 2012 capital budget will be “similar” to the
$957 million it spent last year, including $191 million for
exploration, Chief Financial Officer Leopoldo Alarcon said
yesterday in a mining conference in  Mexico  City organized by
brokerage Corporativo GBM SAB de CV.  Penoles is developing projects to diversify and increase
production in Mexico,  Peru  and  Chile . The Mexico City-based
mining group, controlled by billionaire Alberto Bailleres, is
spending $203 million at its Velardena zinc mine that’s
scheduled to open at the beginning of 2013.  The company is also developing energy plants to lower its
electricity costs. Penoles is expanding this year its wind farm
in the southern state of Oaxaca, Mexico, to 80 megawatts from 50
megawatts. “By 2020, we expect to be self-sufficient in
electricity,” Alarcon said.  -- Editors: Will Wade, Robin Saponar  To contact the reporter on this story:
