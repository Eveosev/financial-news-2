Large parts of  Spain  and Eastern
 Europe  lack water, with less than 200 millimeters (7.87 inches)
of fresh water available each year while demand is three to 10
times higher, the European Union reported.  Fresh water availability in Europe ranges from 10
millimeters a year to more than 500 millimeters, according to
 research  based on 21 years of meteorological data published
online by the EU’s Joint Research Centre today.  Worldwide water use rose sixfold in the past century, more
than twice the rate of population growth, according to the JRC.
Global warming is expected to account for about 20 percent of an
increase in water scarcity this century, the center said.  “The equitable provision of adequate water resources for
agriculture, industry and human consumption poses one of the
greatest challenges of the 21st century,” the JRC wrote.
“Before future challenges can be addressed, a thorough analysis
of current water resources is needed.”  Africa  has large areas with less than 200 millimeters of
fresh water available per year, while areas in Morocco,
equatorial Africa, southwest Ethiopia, eastern  South Africa  and
Madagascar have more, the research showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
