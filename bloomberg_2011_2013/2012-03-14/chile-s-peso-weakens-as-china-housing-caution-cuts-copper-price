Chile ’s peso weakened as copper,
the country’s biggest export, declined after China signaled it
would keep curbs on housing sales.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 485.68 per  U.S. dollar  as of
9:53 a.m. in Santiago, from 483.1 yesterday.  China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  said today that relaxing limits
on the housing market may cause “chaos.” The New York-based
Copper Development Association says construction generates about
40 percent of demand for the metal, used in pipes and wiring.
Copper accounts for more than half of Chile’s exports and the
price of the metal affects flows of dollars into the country.  “Today should have been a rally day, but the Chinese
premier spoke in the morning and said  house prices  were
unreasonable,” said Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile
Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “That clouded the outlook.
It’s killing commodities and copper is a key driver.”  Copper for May delivery slid as much as 1.4 percent to
$3.847 a pound on the Comex in New York.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market cut
their short position in the currency to $5.5 billion on March
12. They had a $5.8 billion short position on March 8, the
biggest since the start of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
