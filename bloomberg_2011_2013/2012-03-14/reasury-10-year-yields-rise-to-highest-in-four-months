Treasuries (YCGT0025)  fell for a sixth day,
the longest losing streak since October, as the  Federal
Reserve ’s raising of its assessment of the U.S. economy damped
the refuge appeal of  U.S. government debt  at a $13 billion
auction of 30-year bonds.  The securities were sold at  yield  of 3.383 percent, the
highest since August. The Fed’s 21 primary dealers that are
required to bid at the sale were awarded 56.3 percent of the
bonds, compared with an average of 52 percent for the past five
sales. Ten-year yields climbed to a four-month high after the
Fed’s statement yesterday damped bets the central bank would buy
more debt under a third round of quantitative easing.  “The selloff in the Treasury market has been fast and
furious,” said  George Goncalves , head of interest-rate strategy
at the primary dealer Nomura Holdings Inc. “A great deal of
confidence has been shaken out of the market in the past few
days. The correction in Treasuries was long overdue.”  The yield on the  30-year bond  rose 14 basis points to 3.4
percent at 5:27 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader prices. It touched 3.42 percent, the highest level since
Oct. 28. The price of the 3.125 percent securities due in
February 2042 tumbled 2 15/32, or $24.69 per $1,000 face amount,
to 94 27/32.  The benchmark  10-year note ’s yield increased 14 basis
points to 2.27 percent. It gained as much as 16 basis points and
touched 2.29 percent, the biggest intraday jump since Oct. 27
and the highest level since Oct. 31. The yield had traded
between 1.79 percent and 2.09 percent this year until yesterday.  ‘Fast and Furious’  “The Street bought a large amount in the auction and there
wasn’t as big of a customer bid here so they are a little
long,” said Thomas Connor, president and head of trading at
Pierpont Securities LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The Fed made
no mention of QE3, and no additional twist. Employment is doing
better. We will have to make a fundamental yield adjustment.”  Today’s high auction yield compared with a forecast of
3.393 percent in a Bloomberg News survey of eight primary
dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.7, compared with an average of 2.63 for the previous 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 29 percent of the bonds. That
compared with an average of 31.2 percent for the past 10 sales.
Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their
bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 14.7 percent, versus
an average of 16.5 percent for the past 10 auctions.  Loss for 2012  U.S. 30-year bonds have lost 6 percent this year, compared
with a 0.9 percent decline in the broader Treasury market,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Long bonds
returned 36 percent in 2011, more than triple the 9.8 percent
gain by Treasuries overall.  The Fed refrained yesterday from new moves to cut borrowing
costs, saying the U.S. labor market is gaining strength.  “The  unemployment rate  has declined notably in recent
months but remains elevated,” the  Federal Open Market Committee 
said in a statement at the conclusion of a meeting.  Ten- and 30-year Treasury yields have climbed the most over
the past two days since Oct. 27, when U.S. bonds tumbled after
European leaders’ efforts to resolve their debt crisis fueled
appetite for higher-yielding assets. The 10-year yield gained 24
basis points, and the 30-year yield rose 23.  Convexity ‘Not Dead’  “The big moves are a big sign that convexity is not
dead,” said Nomura’s Goncalves. “Everyone who tells you that
it didn’t exist was looking in the wrong place.”  Convexity is a measure of the rate of change of a bond’s
duration as a result of changes in  interest rates . Duration is a
measure of a bond’s price sensitivity to changes in interest
rates. Mortgage bonds are described as negatively convex,
meaning that as interest-rates rise, their duration increases as
well because fewer homeowners are likely to refinance.  Yields on  Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac mortgage securities
that guide home-loan rates soared to the highest in almost four
months, suggesting borrowing costs may jump from about record
lows. Fannie Mae’s current-coupon 30-year bonds climbed 0.16
percentage point to 3.17 percent as of 4:15 p.m. in New York,
the highest since Nov. 28 after an increase of 0.12 percentage
point yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 10-year note dropped from a 2011 high of
3.77 percent on Feb. 9 that year to a record low 1.67 percent on
Sept. 23 as investors sought haven amid concern the  U.S. economy 
faced headwinds and  Europe ’s debt crisis was worsening.  This week’s climb in yields came amid an improving economy
and lower prospects of more Fed stimulus.  No ‘Sustained Reversal’  “This is not a sustained reversal,” said  David Rosenberg ,
chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff & Associates
Inc. in Toronto. “A lot of this is predicated on the overall
bullishness permeating the market landscape right now.  Treasury 10-year yields will fall to 1.75 percent by June
and 1.5 percent by the end of the year amid prospects for less
fiscal stimulus and cuts in federal spending, Rosenberg said.  Scott Minerd, chief investment officer of Guggenheim
Partners LLC, who oversees more than $125 billion from  Santa
Monica ,  California , said 10-year yields need to breach 4 percent
to break out of the “long-term bullish bond trend.”  “It’s a near term sea change,” Minerd said. “But we have
seen the low in interest rates. We are clearly bottoming out in
rates and setting the stage for a generational  bear market . Once
4 percent on the 10-year note is breached, we are off to the
races.”  Volatility Jumps  Volatility jumped from the lowest level in more than four
years. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which
measures price swings based on options, increased to 89.7 basis
points today, the highest since Jan. 3. It reached 69.9 basis
points on March 12, the least since July 2007. The reading means
traders expect a yield range of 89.7 basis points on an
annualized basis in the next month.  Treasury market volume climbed. About $437 billion of  U.S.
debt  changed hands through ICAP Plc, the world’s largest
interdealer broker, the most since Aug. 10. The average full-day
volume over the past year is $270 billion.  Valuation measures show government debt is becoming less
expensive. The term premium, a model created by economists at
the Fed, was negative 0.4 percent today, the least since
October. The figure touched negative 0.79 percent on Feb. 2, the
most expensive ever, and compares with the average of positive
0.56 percent over the past decade. A negative reading indicates
investors are willing to accept yields below what’s considered
fair value.  The gap between yields on two- and 30-year Treasuries,
called the yield curve, rose to 301 basis points, the most since
Oct. 28.  The 10-year  break-even rate , a gauge of the outlook for
consumer prices derived from the difference between yields on
conventional and inflation-linked notes, rose to 2.39 percentage
points, a level last seen on Aug. 2.  To contact the reporters on this story:
