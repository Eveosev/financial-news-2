European oil-product inventories
fell below the five-year average in January for the first time
since November 2007, the  International Energy Agency  said.  Middle distillate fuels including diesel and gasoil led the
decline, dropping by 6.5 million barrels, the IEA said today in
its monthly oil-market report. Demand for diesel and gasoil,
which is used in heating, has been “strong,” the IEA said.  European gasoil futures are trading at the highest level
for the time of year since at least 2008 on London’s ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange. Domestic heating oil stockpiles fell by 3
percentage points to 54 percent full at the end of January,
according to the IEA. Germany is Europe’s biggest market for
heating oil.  Production of middle distillates in Europe was reduced at
the start of the year by disruption at refineries owned by
Petroplus Holdings AG after the company filed for insolvency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
