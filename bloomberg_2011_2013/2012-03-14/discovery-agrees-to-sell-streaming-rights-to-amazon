Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) ,
owner of cable networks Animal Planet and TLC, will sell some of
its older programming to  Amazon Inc. (AMZN) ’s streaming service.  The cable programmer is selling online-streaming rights to
shows from six of its 14 U.S. networks, which Amazon will make
available to users of its Prime customer loyalty program,
according to a statement. They include Discovery Channel’s
“Dirty Jobs” and Animal Planet’s “Whale Wars.” Financial
terms were not disclosed.  Discovery, based in  Silver Spring ,  Maryland , has a similar
deal with  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  that allows streaming-service rights to
some of Discovery’s older programming for a two-year period with
the option for a third.  Amazon, the world’s largest Internet retailer, has 3
million to 5 million subscribers to Prime, a program begun in
2005 that provides two-day shipping for $79 a year, people
familiar with the matter said last month. The Seattle-based
company is working to reach 7 million to 10 million in the next
12 to 18 months. Netflix, by comparison, has 21.4 million
domestic subscribers to its streaming service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
