Mike D’Antoni  is out as coach of
the  New York Knicks  amid a six-game losing streak, a person with
knowledge of the situation said.  The person was granted anonymity because he wasn’t
authorized to discuss the move publicly.  Barry Watkins, a spokesman for the National Basketball
Association team, declined to comment. D’Antoni’s departure was
reported earlier today by Yahoo! Inc.’s sports website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
