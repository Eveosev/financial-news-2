Estonia approved legal changes to
make it easier for employers to terminate collective agreements
even after trade unions objected.  Lawmakers voted 53-40 to back amendments stopping such
agreements from running indefinitely, which the Justice
Chancellor has ruled unconstitutional. Unions had sought to keep
the main terms of contracts that had been terminated valid for a
transition period, Harri Taliga, chairman of the  Confederation
of Estonian Trade Unions , said last month in an interview.  “The unions’ protest against the changes is natural
because employers will gain a significant advantage for future
negotiations: the option to threaten the unilateral annulment of
earlier-agreed conditions,” Eiki Nestor, a lawmaker with the
opposition Social Democrats, said before the vote. “When
workers’ rights are curbed, strikes will result.”  Estonia endured its biggest industrial action since
regaining independence in 1991 last week, when blue-collar
workers supported a three-day nationwide strike by teachers over
wages. More than 1,000 workers staged a rally in the center of
the capital, Tallinn, on Feb. 18 to protest the collective-
agreement amendments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
