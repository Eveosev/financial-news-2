Gunmen killed seven people in
northern  Nigeria  in separate attacks yesterday that targeted the
West African nation’s security forces, police and military
officials said.  Gunmen on motorbikes opened fire on a military patrol in
the northeastern town of Mubi in Adamawa state, killing a
soldier, a policeman and three civilians who were hit by stray
bullets, Altine Daniel, a police spokesman, said by telephone
today from the city of Yola, the state capital.  “Three soldiers also sustained serious injuries,” Daniel
said.  In the northern city of Kano, attackers on motorbikes shot
dead two policemen and injured another at a checkpoint, Ikedi
Iweaha, a military spokesman in the city, said by telephone
today.  Authorities in Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
the Taliban-inspired Islamist group of Boko Haram, whose name
means “Western education is a sin,” for a surge in gun and
bomb attacks in the country’s mainly Muslim north that have
claimed hundreds of lives since 2009.  Boko Haram this month denied its members killed a British
and Italian hostage in the northwest state of Sokoto during an
attempted rescue by Nigerian and U.K. special forces troopers.
Nigeria accused the group of responsibility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
