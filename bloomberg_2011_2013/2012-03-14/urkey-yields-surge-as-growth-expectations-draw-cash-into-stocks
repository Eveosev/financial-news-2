Turkish  yields  climbed for a second
day this week as investors sold bonds and bought equities on
expectation that the economy will continue to grow.  Yields on benchmark two-year debt rose 13 basis points, or
0.13 percentage point, to 9.42 percent at the close in Istanbul.
The main  ISE National 100 (XU100)  index jumped 2.4 percent to 60,835.74,
the biggest gain since Feb. 1.  “Finally market participants came to the realization that
growth is the real story here,”Isik Okte, chief strategist at
broker Halk Invest in Istanbul, said in e-mailed comments.
“When you believe the growth story, you think rates are going
to rise, you sell bonds and buy equities.”  The lira fell 1 percent to 1.8085 per dollar at 5:50 p.m.,
its weakest since Jan. 24. The currency broke its 50-day moving
average on March 12, according to Okte, when Turkey announced
the current-account deficit in January was bigger than expected
at $6 billion.  “Investors are worrying again over the high current
account in  Turkey ,” Thu Lan Nguyen, a Commerzbank AG currency
strategist in  Frankfurt , said by e-mail. “Against the
background of persistently high  oil prices , this definitely does
not bode well” for the lira, she said.  The central bank is unlikely to tolerate renewed lira
depreciation, Nguyen said. The currency fell 18 percent against
the dollar last year, the world’s biggest drop.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  is targeting economic
growth of at least 4 percent this year in his medium-term
economic program published in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
