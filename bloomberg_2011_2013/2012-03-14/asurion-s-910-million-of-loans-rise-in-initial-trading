Asurion Corp.’s $910 million of
loans to refinance debt rose in initial trading, according to
data provider Markit Group Ltd.  The $610 million first-lien  term loan  began trading at 99.4
cents on the dollar, according to Markit. The debt was sold to
investors at 98.5 cents, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A $300 million second-lien term loan that was sold to
investors at par began trading at 101.73 cents, according to
Markit.  The first-lien piece pays interest at 4 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate while the second-
lien portion pays 7.5 percentage points above Libor, the data
show. Both the first- and second-lien loans have a 1.5 percent
minimum on the lending benchmark.  Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG
arranged the financing for the provider of wireless handset and
roadside assistance, the data show.  Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, Providence Equity Partners
Inc. and Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe acquired Nashville,
Tennessee-based Asurion for $4.1 billion in July 2007, Bloomberg
data show.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
