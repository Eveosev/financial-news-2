Greece ’s banking system saw more
than 3 billion euros ($4 billion) withdrawn by businesses and
households last month,  Naftemporiki  said, citing bank estimates.  Early figures for March show a stabilization in the amount
of money being withdrawn and banks reckon the successful
conclusion of Greece’s debt-swap means some funds will return,
the Athens-based newspaper reported today.  Deposits dropped to 169 billion euros in January from 174
billion in December, the  Bank of Greece (TELL)  said on Feb. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
