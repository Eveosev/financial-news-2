U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  has asked her Russian counterpart to warn Iran that it
has one “last chance” to reach a negotiated settlement over
its nuclear program and avoid military action,  Kommersant  said.  Clinton delivered the message at a meeting with  Sergei Lavrov  at the United Nations on March 12, the Moscow-based
newspaper said, without citing anyone.  The Foreign Ministry’s press service in Moscow declined to
comment on the report, saying only that Lavrov hasn’t scheduled
talks with Iranian officials “yet.” The U.S. Embassy in Moscow
referred a request for a comment to a U.S. State Department
official, who didn’t respond to calls outside normal business
hours.  Russia expects a strike on  Iran  by the end of this year,
Kommersant said, citing an unidentified senior Foreign Ministry
official. World powers have invited Iran to hold a new round of
talks to reach a deal to allay suspicions that the Iranian
nuclear program is aimed at building atomic weapons.  President  Barack Obama  said this month that he takes “no
options off the table,” to stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear
weapon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after
talks with Obama that his country reserves the right to act
alone against Iran .  To contact the reporter on this story:
