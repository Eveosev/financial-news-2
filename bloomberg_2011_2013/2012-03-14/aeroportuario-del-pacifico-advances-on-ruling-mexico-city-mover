Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico
SAB ,  Mexico ’s biggest publicly traded airport operator, climbed
the most since August after saying a court ruling bolstered
efforts to stop  Grupo Mexico  SAB from buying more of its shares.  Shares of the Guadalajara, Mexico-based company rose 1.9
percent to 49.05 pesos, the biggest advance since Aug. 29. The
benchmark IPC index of Mexican companies fell 0.1 percent.  The company said a ruling by a Mexican federal court was
“in favor” of its efforts to stop Grupo Mexico SAB, a Mexico
City-based mining and transportation company, from boosting its
holdings of the airport operator. The airport operator says
Grupo Mexico’s purchase of its shares through the open market is
in violation of its bylaws that limit holdings by outside
companies, while Grupo Mexico has said the purchases are legal
and denied it’s aiming for a takeover.  A lack of clarity about whether Grupo Mexico will seek
control of the airport operator has been a drag on Grupo
Aeroportuario del Pacifico shares, said Elizandra Cardoso Azcoitia, an analyst with Grupo Financiero Interacciones.  The court ruling “could have been taken as an excuse to
push the price up,” she said from Mexico City.  Grupo Mexico fell 0.1 percent in Mexico City. Company
spokesman  Juan Rebolledo  declined to comment, saying lawyers
were reviewing the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
