Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX)  sued
Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd.,  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) ,
 Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (GNP)  and two other drugmakers claiming
they seek to sell a generic version of the hypertension pill
Bystolic before a U.S. patent expires.  Forest, based in New York, is the exclusive licensee for
the patent issued to  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s Janssen Pharmaceutica
in 2003. The generic drugmakers filed for permission to sell
versions of the drug’s 2.5-milligram, 5-milligram, 10-milligram
and 20-milligram capsules, according to the complaint filed
yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  Bystolic, a once-daily treatment, contains nebivolol
hydrochloride and is used for the treatment of high blood
pressure. The drug was introduced in the U.S. in 2008.  Glenmark declined to comment on the complaint. Glenmark
“believes it is the first company to have filed a substantially
complete” application with the FDA to sell a generic version of
the drug, the Mumbai-based company said in an e-mailed
statement.  The U.S. subsidiary of Ahmedabad, India-based Torrent
declined to comment on the case. Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for
Parsippany, New Jersey-based Watson, didn’t immediately return a
phone call seeking comment.  The case is Forest Laboratories Inc. v.  Torrent
Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (TRP) , 12-00305, U.S. District Court District, of
Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
