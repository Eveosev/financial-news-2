Desfa SA , a Greek natural gas grid
operator, invited international investors to bid for the design
and construction of a third liquefied natural gas storage tank
at its Revithoussa LNG terminal facility near  Athens .  The tank, expected to cost as much as 115 million euros
($150 million), will have capacity of 95,000 cubic meters and
will increase the facility’s total LNG storage to 225,000 cubic
meters, Athens-based Desfa said in a statement today.  Desfa will begin work in the coming months to upgrade port
facilities at Revithoussa so the terminal can serve LNG ships
with carrying capacity of 260,000 cubic meters compared to the
current limit of 135,000 cubic meters. The upgrade is scheduled
for completion in 2015.  Greece  plans to sell Desfa, a fully owned unit of state-
run gas supplier Depa SA, either as a separate entity or
together with its parent, Energy Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said Feb. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
