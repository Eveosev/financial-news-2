Bahrain’s Justice Ministry will
start receiving on March 18 civil settlement applications to
compensate victims of violence from last year’s mass protests.  The ministry set up the civil settlement initiative in line
with recommendations from an independent international
commission that investigated possible human rights abuses during
the February-March 2011 protests. At least 35 people were killed
during the rallies and an ensuing crackdown through April last
year, the commission has said.  The initiative “does not annul the victims’ right to
pursue legal settlement,” the state-run Information Affairs
Authority said today in an e-mailed statement, citing a ministry
official. “The initiative’s beneficiaries include families of
deceased victims, physical injuries or abuse, along with other
cases seen fit for settlement as per the circumstances of each
case.”  Mass protests led by Bahrain’s Shiite majority broke out a
year ago demanding democracy and equal rights from the Sunni
monarchy, leading to a crackdown by security forces in which
troops from neighboring  Saudi Arabia , also ruled by Sunnis, were
called in to help. Tensions in the island nation have simmered
in Shiite areas throughout the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
