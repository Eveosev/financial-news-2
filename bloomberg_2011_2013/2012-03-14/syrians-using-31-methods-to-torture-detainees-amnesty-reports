Syria  is using 31 methods of
torture and ill-treatment to create a “nightmarish world” for
those detained during the yearlong uprising against President
Bashar al-Assad’s government, Amnesty International said.  Many Syrians taken into custody by the security forces said
they were beaten on arrest and then faced further abuse from
sticks, rifle butts, whips and fists or braided cables when
arriving at detention centers, a practice sometimes called the
“haflet al-istiqbal” or “reception,” according to the
London-based human rights group.  The abuse became harsher when detainees were interrogated
with methods including the “tyre,” where victims are forced
into a vehicle tyre, lifted up and beaten with cables or sticks,
according to accounts in a 42-page report today.  The testimony “give disturbing insights into a system of
detention and interrogation which, a year after protests began,
appears intended primarily to degrade, humiliate and terrify its
victims into silence,” Ann Harrison, Amnesty interim deputy
director for the  Middle East  and North Africa, said in the
report.  More than 7,500 Syrians have been killed during the
fighting while another 32,000 have fled to  Turkey , Lebanon and
Jordan, according to the  United Nations . Syrian forces are
sowing minefields along the country’s borders,  Human Rights
Watch  said yesterday.  Amnesty said it interviewed dozens of Syrians including 25
who said they were abused and later fled the country. Other
methods of torture included electric shocks, electric prods and
rape in front of other prisoners, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
