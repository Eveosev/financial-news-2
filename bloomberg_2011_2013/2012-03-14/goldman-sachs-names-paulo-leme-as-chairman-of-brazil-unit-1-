Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the
fifth-largest U.S. bank by assets, named Paulo Leme as chairman
of its unit in  Brazil .  Leme will help in “deepening the firm’s relationship with
existing clients and expanding its portfolio of new clients,”
the New York-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement. He
will report to Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, the president of the
division, and Stephen Scherr, the bank’s head for Latin America.  “Brazil is living an important moment, and there are huge
opportunities for Goldman Sachs to help its clients,” Leme said
in the statement.  Leme, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1993, will move to Sao
Paulo from Miami. He was previously the bank’s chief Latin
America economist.  To contact the reporters on this story:
