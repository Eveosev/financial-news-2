Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (CP) 
reaffirmed its support for Chief Executive Officer Fred Green
following a news report the board would be open to a management
shakeup proposed by its biggest investor, William Ackman.  Green “has the unanimous support of the board,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement today. The Financial Post
said yesterday the board “could consider a management shakeup”
before a May shareholder meeting if Ackman’s plan to improve
performance by replacing the CEO gains a foothold with
shareholders.  The Financial Post story cited Tony Ingram, a director,
saying the board “will look at any request and consider it, I’m
sure.”  Canadian Pacific  has said Green is the best person to run
the company while Ackman, founder of Pershing Square Capital
Management LP, pushes for  Hunter Harrison  to take his place.
Ackman plans a proxy battle at the May meeting and seeks to
elect a slate of six directors to the board in order to hire
Harrison, the former head of larger rival Canadian National
Railway Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
