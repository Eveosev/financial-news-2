A Russian court refused bail to two
members of an all-female punk band who are facing seven years in
jail for a political protest act inside Moscow’s Christ the
Savior cathedral.  The Moscow City court ordered the two women to remain in
pre-trial detention, rejecting an appeal for their release,
defense lawyer Nikolai Polozov said on his Twitter Inc. account
today. They plan to appeal to the  European Court  of Human
Rights, Polozov told the  BBC ’s Russian service website.  Masked young women wearing skimpy dresses performed what
they called a “punk prayer” in front of the altar at the
country’s main Christian Orthodox place of worship, calling on
the Virgin Mary to “expel” Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin .  Putin’s spokesman,  Dmitry Peskov , described the Feb. 21
stunt as “disgusting.” Several thousand bloggers signed a
letter asking Orthodox Patriarch Kirill to intervene and
pressure authorities to release the two women, who have been in
jail since March 3, and stop criminal proceedings for
hooliganism against them.  Mass protests against alleged electoral fraud brought tens
of thousands of people onto the streets in Moscow and other
cities, sparking the largest unrest in Putin’s decade in power.  While the demonstrations showed signs of cooling, with
10,000 to 25,000 people taking part in a March 10 rally in
Moscow, opposition leaders are vowing to keep up protests after
Putin’s disputed election to a new Kremlin term on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
