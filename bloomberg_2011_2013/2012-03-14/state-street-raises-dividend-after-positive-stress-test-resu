State Street Corp. (STT) , the third-
biggest custody bank, raised its quarterly dividend 33 percent
after it passed the U.S. Federal Reserve’s  stress test  scenario
yesterday and received approval for its 2012 capital plan.  The firm increased the quarterly payout to 24 cents a share
from 18 cents a share payable April 16, the Boston-based company
said today in a statement. Its board of directors also approved
a share repurchase program of up to $1.8 billion in common stock
through March 31, 2013.  State Street emerged as the second strongest among the 19
largest U.S. banks when the Fed tested its ability to withstand
a recession under current capital plans.  Bank of New York Mellon
Corp. (BK)  would have the highest Tier 1 common capital ratio at 13.1
percent in the fourth quarter of 2013 under the hypothetical
stress scenario, followed by State Street at 12.5 percent.  State Street’s Tier 1 common capital ratio at the end of
September was 16 percent, best among the 19 banks.  The firm’s shares rose 2.3 percent to close at $44.88 in
New York trading. State Street has increased 11 percent this
year, compared with a gain of 17 percent for the 20-member
 Standard & Poor’s   index  of asset managers and custody banks.  Custody banks keep records, track performance and lend
securities to institutional investors including mutual funds,
pension funds and  hedge funds . The company also manages
investments for individuals and institutions under its State
Street Global Advisors unit. BNY Mellon is the largest custody
bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
