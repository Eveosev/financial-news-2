AMR Corp. (AMR) , the bankrupt parent of
 American Airlines , said it will present cost-cutting plans for
its American Eagle unit to the regional carrier’s unions on
March 21.  Plans for restructuring Eagle must proceed even though AMR
hasn’t reached agreements with unions at American on $1.25
billion in labor concessions,  Bruce Hicks , a company spokesman,
said in an interview today. Changes being sought in American’s
pilot contract will affect flying done by Eagle.  AMR’s Nov. 29 bankruptcy filing ended plans for a 2012
spinoff of Eagle, which supplies more than 90 percent of
American’s regional passenger feed to hub airports from smaller
cities. American’s Feb. 1 plan for eliminating 13,000 jobs
didn’t cover Eagle, which had 14,237 employees at the time.  The Transport Workers Union told members in an e-mail that
Eagle Chief Executive Officer Dan Garton will brief labor
leaders on the savings goals. The Air Line Pilots Association
declined to immediately comment, and the  Association of Flight
Attendants  didn’t immediately respond to e-mails.  AMR’s plan for a stand-alone Eagle was envisioned as a way
to let  Fort Worth , Texas-based American seek less-expensive
options for regional flights.  Eagle said in January it would stop flying 21 ATR
turboprops based at Dallas-Fort Worth airport as part of changes
in AMR’s bankruptcy, and last month said it would pull nine more
based in Miami. The regional unit told 218 workers in December
that some of them might be laid off as a result of such changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
