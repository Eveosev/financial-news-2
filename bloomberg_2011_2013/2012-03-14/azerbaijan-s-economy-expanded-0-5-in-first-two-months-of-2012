Azerbaijan’s economy expanded 0.5
percent from a year earlier in the first two months of 2012,
driven by growth outside of the energy industry.  The Caspian Sea nation’s non-energy economy grew 7.1
percent, generating almost 43 percent of gross domestic product,
the State Statistics Committee said today on its website. The
oil and natural-gas industries shrank 4.5 percent, it said.  Azerbaijan is the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union . Its economy grew 0.1 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
