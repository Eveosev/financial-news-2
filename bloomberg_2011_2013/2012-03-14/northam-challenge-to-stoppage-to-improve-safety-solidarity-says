Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM) ’s successful
application to have a safety stoppage at the company’s
Zondereinde mine suspended may lead to better enforcement of the
Mine Health and Safety Act, labor union Solidarity said.  While relaxing so-called section 54 orders, which enable
inspectors to close all or part of a mine if they have reason to
believe it may endanger workers’ safety, would be “extremely
irresponsible,” unfairly suspending operations may affect
mines’ sustainability and mineworkers’ job security, said Paul
Mardon, head of Solidarity’s occupational health and safety
division.  “The emphasis must therefore be placed on the correct
enforcement of section 54,” Mardon said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
