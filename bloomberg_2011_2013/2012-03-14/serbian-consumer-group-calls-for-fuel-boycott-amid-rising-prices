The  Serbian National Organization
of Consumers  called for a boycott tomorrow of filling stations
to protest rising fuel prices.  The prices have risen almost 10 percent this year along
with crude oil and a weakening dinar in the country that relies
on imported oil, prompting demands that retailers reduce their
margins and the government cut excise duties on gasoline and
diesel.  “We understand that the price of crude oil on the world
markets is high, but we cannot and will not understand our
government and oil products traders who have no regard for the
common consumer,” the organization said in a statement yesteday
calling for the one-day boycott to coincide with  World Consumer
Rights Day . “Let March 15 be remembered as the day when no one
bought a single liter of fuel.”  Both Serbian refineries are run by  Naftna Industrija Srbije
AD (NIIS) , majority-owned by  Russia ’s  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) , which also has
a network of some 400 gas stations in the country. Its monopoly
on oil imports ended last year as part of efforts to liberalize
the market, when the government also canceled price caps on gas,
diesel and heating oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
