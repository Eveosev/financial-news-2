The South African  Reserve Bank  has
become “more active” buying dollars in the foreign-exchange
market in March after the rand advanced to a five-month high,
ETM Analytics said.  “Market talk suggests that the Reserve Bank has become
more active in mopping up some dollars towards 7.5000 rand” per
dollar,  George Glynos , an analyst at the Johannesburg-based
company, which advises corporations on foreign-exchange
transactions, said in an e-mailed research note. Central bank
intervention “should leave the downside reasonably well
contained and the dollar-rand continuing to trade in a 7.48 to
7.60 range,” he added.  The rand has climbed 7.3 percent against the dollar this
year, rising to 7.4025 per dollar on Feb. 29, the strongest
level since Sept. 19. It retreated 0.2 percent today to 7.5393
as of 11:18 a.m. in Johannesburg.  The Reserve Bank adds to its foreign-exchange reserves “as
and when appropriate,” though it doesn’t target a level for the
rand and won’t sell dollars to defend the currency, Governor
Gill Marcus said in October. The bank’s mandate is to keep
inflation within a 3 percent to 6 percent target range.  The central bank’s gross foreign exchange and gold reserves
rose 0.9 percent in February from the previous month to a record
$51.9 billion as the price of gold surged and the dollar
weakened, boosting the value of other foreign currencies, the
Pretoria-based Reserve Bank said on March 7. The bank probably
made no “material” dollar purchases in the month, Standard
Bank Group Ltd. said in a research note on the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
