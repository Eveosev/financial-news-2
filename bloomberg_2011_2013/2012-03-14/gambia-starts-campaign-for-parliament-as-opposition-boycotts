Campaigning for Gambia’s March 29
parliamentary election began today, with President Yahya Jammeh’s ruling party facing no opposition in more than half of
the legislative body’s seats.  The leader’s Alliance for Patriotic Re-orientation and
Construction will field candidates for all 48 seats, according
to statement from the Independent Electoral Commission handed to
reporters in Banjul, the capital, today. In 25 areas, the APRC
contestant will face no opposition, according to the statement.  A group of opposition parties pledged not to take part in
the election on March 8, calling for an end to barriers they say
prevent them from being a viable opposition.  Twenty independent candidates and eight from the National
Reconciliation Party have registered to run in the election, the
commission said in the statement.  Jammeh won a fourth term in office in November, extending
his 17-year year of the small West African nation that is
bordered on three sides by  Senegal . The Economic Community of
West African States, an Abuja, Nigeria-based regional group,
declined to send observers to the polls, saying the preparations
for the vote and political environment weren’t conducive to a
free and fair ballot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
