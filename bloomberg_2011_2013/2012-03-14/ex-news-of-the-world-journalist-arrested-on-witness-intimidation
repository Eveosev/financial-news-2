Neville Thurlbeck, a former
journalist at  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s News of the World, was arrested by
London police investigating phone hacking on suspicion of
intimidation of a witness, according to a person familiar with
the situation.  A 51-year-old journalist, the first person detained in the
probe on April 5, 2011, was arrested a second time today, the
Metropolitan Police said in a statement, without identifying the
suspect. Thurlbeck was arrested by appointment today, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the situation is
sensitive.  Six people were arrested yesterday, including former of the
News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks and her husband, as
police widened the phone hacking investigation to focus on a
possible cover up. More than 20 people have been arrested as
part Operation Weeting, the phone-hacking investigation, and at
least 10 have been detained since the beginning of the year in a
separate bribery probe.  Thurlbeck was arrested as part of the phone hacking probe
last year and has since said he never participated in the crime
or authorized it. He didn’t immediately return calls seeking
comment.  Thurlbeck’s name came up in an e-mail titled “for
Neville” containing the transcripts of voice mails hacked from
 Gordon Taylor , chief executive of the Professional Footballers’
Association. News Corp. ultimately paid 700,000 pounds ($1.1
million) to settle the case.  Sky News  said the arrest was related to a post on
Thurlbeck’s blog that identified the street a News Corp.
official lived on.  To contact the reporter on this story:
