Sales of  Sky-mobi Ltd. (MOBI) , a Chinese
provider of mobile-phone applications, will be unchanged in the
fiscal year ending March 31, 2013, Chief Financial Officer Carl Yeung said, as the country’s market for lower-end feature phones
shrinks.  Sky-mobi Ltd. will benefit from increasing sales of
smartphones starting from September this year, Yeung said in an
interview at Bloomberg’s headquarters in  New York . Contributions
from smartphone applications to revenue will become
“significant” in 2013, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
