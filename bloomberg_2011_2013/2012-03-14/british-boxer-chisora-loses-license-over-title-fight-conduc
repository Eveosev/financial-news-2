British boxer Dereck Chisora lost
his license for his conduct before and after his heavyweight
title fight against Vitali Klitschko in Munich last month.  Chisora, 28, slapped World Boxing Council champion
Klitschko at the weigh-in, spat water at Klitschko’s brother
Wladimir and brawled with former World Boxing Association
champion  David Haye  at the post-fight news conference.  Chisora, who lost the fight in a unanimous decision,
appeared at a hearing today with the British Boxing Board of
Control, which said he was “not a fit and proper person” to
hold a license. He has 14 days to appeal against the decision.  “Dereck Chisora, on his own admission, did not behave in a
manner consistent with that of a professional boxer and let down
now only himself and his family, but also all those license
holders who behave in a professional manner,” board secretary
 Robert Smith  said in a statement. Such behavior “will not be
tolerated,” he added.  Smith also said the board could not take action against
Haye because he is officially retired, although his role in the
brawl will be considered should be apply for a license again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
