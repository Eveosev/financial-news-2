Former Federal Reserve Chairman
 Paul Volcker  said the U.S. expansion, while recently showing
signs of strength, has yet to reach sufficient momentum.  “The economy has picked up in the last few months but in
my mind we are still far from satisfactory activity,” Volcker
said today at a conference in  Washington  sponsored by The
Atlantic. He sees “a long slog for us before we can claim
success,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
