Nestle Nigeria Plc (NESTLE) , the West
African nation’s largest food company by market value, fell the
most in 10 weeks as investors bet a recent rally in the stock
was overdone.  The stock lost the daily limit of 5 percent, the most since
Jan. 3, to 462.37 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos,
snapping a five-day, 22 percent gain.  “A lot of investors are selling so the demand is not
strong enough to hold the price at that bullish level,” David Adonri, Chief Executive Officer of Lambeth Trust and Investment
Co., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone today.  Nestle Nigeria, a unit of Nestle SA, the world’s biggest
food company, aims to double its business in  Africa ’s most
populous country within three years, the company said in
February 2011, after it opened a factory near Lagos, the
commercial capital. Nigeria is Nestle’s second-biggest market on
the continent after  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
