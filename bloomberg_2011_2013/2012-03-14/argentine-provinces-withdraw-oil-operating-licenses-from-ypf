YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s biggest crude
producer, will lose an estimated 9 percent of its output after
the provinces of Chubut and Santa Cruz pulled oil operating
licenses for under-investing in the fields.  “The federal government supports this decision by the
provinces because its about enforcing the law,” national Energy
Secretary Daniel Cameron said today at a press conference in
Santa Cruz. President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  supports
the measure, Cameron said.  YPF is facing mounting pressure from Fernandez’s government
and the country’s oil-producing provinces to boost investments
amid output declines and rising fuel imports. The fields for
which the licenses were withdrawn represent about 9 percent of
YPF’s national output, according to national Energy secretariat
data.  YPF has 90 days to return the four fields to the two
provinces, Chubut Governor Martin Buzzi said at the same press
conference.  YPF is  controlled  by  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,  Spain ’s largest energy
company, which has a 57.4 percent stake.  Argentina’s Eskenazi
family holds a 25.4 percent stake and operates YPF.  “We got tired of policies created in Spain to take away
away our oil,” Santa Cruz Governor Daniel Peralta said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
