Exports of Azeri Light crude from
Georgiaâ€™s Black Sea port of Supsa will increase to five cargoes
in April, one more than this month, according to a loading
schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  Shipments will total 3 million barrels, or 100,000 barrels
a day, up from 77,419 barrels in March, the plan shows.  BP Plc (BP/)  operates the Baku-Supsa pipeline, which carries
Azeri Light from the  Caspian Sea  to the Black Sea.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
