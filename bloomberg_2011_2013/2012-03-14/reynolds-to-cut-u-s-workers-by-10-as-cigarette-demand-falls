Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) , the second-
largest U.S. tobacco company, plans to eliminate 10 percent of
its U.S. workforce, or about 540 jobs, in the next three years
as demand for cigarettes slumps.  The reductions, including salaried and hourly positions,
will result in a pretax restructuring charge of about $110
million in the first-quarter for severance, benefits and related
costs, Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based Reynolds said today
in a statement. As of Dec. 31, it had about 5,400 workers.  The job cuts will enable Chief Executive Officer Daniel Delen to reduce annual costs by $25 million this year and $70
million a year in 2015. Reynoldsâ€™ share of U.S. cigarette sales
slipped to 27 percent in the fourth quarter, down 1.1 percentage
points from a year earlier, as shipments tumbled 7.4 percent.  Most of the departures of employees are voluntary, Reynolds
said.  Four brands gained market share last year, including Camel,
 Pall Mall , American Natural Spirit cigarettes and Grizzly snuff,
the company said last month.  By revenue, Reynolds trails  Altria Group Inc. (MO) , the maker of
top-selling Marlboro cigarettes.  Reynolds  slipped  1.3 percent to $41.33 at the close in  New
York . The shares have declined 0.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
