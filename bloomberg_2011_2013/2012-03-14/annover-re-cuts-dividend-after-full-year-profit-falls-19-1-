Hannover Re (HNR1) , the world’s fourth-
biggest reinsurer, cut its  dividend  payout after full-year
profit fell 19 percent on higher claims from natural disasters.  Net income declined to 606 million euros ($790 million)
last year from 749 million euros a year earlier, the Hanover,
Germany-based company said in an e-mailed  statement  today. The
reinsurer proposed a dividend of 2.10 euros per share for 2011
after a payout of 2.30 euros for 2010.  Hannover Re , led by Chief Executive Officer  Ulrich Wallin ,
said last month it surpassed a 500 million-euro 2011 profit
target by about 100 million euros after selling “high-quality”
government debt and reinvesting the proceeds in corporate bonds.
Earnings of insurers and the reinsurers who help them shoulder
risks for clients were hurt last year by near record-low
 interest rates  and losses from disasters, including the
earthquakes in  Japan  and  New Zealand .  “Particularly thanks to the further increase in our
 shareholders’ equity , we are able to pay a dividend for 2011
that is somewhat higher than our strategic dividend target of 35
percent to 40 percent of group net income,” Wallin said. The
2011 payout represents a payout ratio of 42 percent.  Hannover Re  rose  65.5 cents, or 1.6 percent, to 42.79 euros
by 12:26 p.m. in Frankfurt trading, bringing the gain this year
to 12 percent and valuing the company at about 5.2 billion
euros. By comparison, the 28-company  Bloomberg Europe 500
Insurance Index (BEINSUR)  has climbed 19 percent in 2012. The reinsurer is
50.2 percent owned by German insurer Talanx AG.  Increasing Premiums  Hannover Re said it’s “looking to the current financial
year with optimism,” without giving a profit target for 2012.  Net income rose 34 percent to 224 million euros in the
fourth quarter, helped by positive currency effects and lower
taxes. That beat the 203 million-euro average estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The floods in  Thailand  cost the
reinsurer about 196 million euros, an estimate that Wallin
called “conservative” at a press conference in Hanover today.  Hannover Re aims to increase its gross premiums by 5
percent to 7 percent after a 5.8 percent increase to 12.1
billion euros in 2011, it said. Return on investments is
expected to be about 3.5 percent this year, compared with 3.9
percent in 2011.  2011 Disasters  Last year’s natural disasters cost insurers and reinsurers
a record $105 billion, surpassing the $101 billion in 2005, when
hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma struck the U.S. and other
regions in the  Gulf of Mexico ,  Munich Re  said on Jan. 4. More
than half of last year’s insured losses will be paid by
reinsurers, according to reinsurance broker Willis Re.  Hannover Re said on Nov. 9 that it planned to pay a
dividend for 2011 that “could even exceed 40 percent of group
net income.” Analysts  expected  the reinsurer would cut the
payout to 2.05 euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Munich Re (MUV2) , the world’s biggest reinsurer, said yesterday
that it aims to more than triple profit to about 2.5 billion
euros this year as investment income increases and Greek debt
writedowns aren’t repeated. The Munich-based company proposed an
unchanged dividend for 2011.  Legal Change  Hannover Re said in a separate statement today that it will
change its legal form to a  Societas Europaea , or SE, a European
public limited company. The change is still subject to the
approval of the annual shareholders meeting in May.  “The legal form of an SE enables the company to relocate
its registered office within the European Union,” Hannover Re
said. “This could become significant in connection with the
implementation of Solvency II. Hannover Re does not, however,
have any concrete plans for such a relocation of its registered
office at the present time.”  Relocation might make sense if Hannover Re would gain “a
substantial advantage” in seeking regulatory approval for an
internal model under new Solvency II rules that would be
independent from the company’s main shareholders, Wallin said at
the press conference today. “We don’t expect this to be the
case, but we need to make sure that we would be able to act if
needed,” he added.  Solvency II rules are scheduled for introduction in 2013.
Regulators and the European Union have agreed to postpone full
application of the rules until 2014, following discussions with
the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
