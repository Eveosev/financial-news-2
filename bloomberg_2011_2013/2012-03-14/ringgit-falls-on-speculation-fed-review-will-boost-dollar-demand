Malaysia’s ringgit fell to the
lowest level in almost a month on speculation investors will
favor the dollar over emerging-market assets after the  Federal
Reserve  raised its assessment of the world’s largest economy.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against those
of six major trading partners, climbed to an eight-week high
after the Fed said in a statement yesterday that unemployment in
the U.S. has “declined notably.” Malaysia’s five-year
government bonds dropped for a second day.  “If the U.S. were to recover faster than expected, a lot
of fund flows will go back there,” said Lam Chee Mun, a  fund
manager  at TA Investment Management Bhd in Kuala Lumpur. “This
will damp the Malaysian market.”  The ringgit declined 0.5 percent to 3.0500 per dollar as of
5:24 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0563 earlier, the weakest level since
February 17. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 40 basis
points, or 0.40 percentage point, to 7.90 percent.  The yield on the 4.262 percent notes due September 2016
rose two basis points to 3.32 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
