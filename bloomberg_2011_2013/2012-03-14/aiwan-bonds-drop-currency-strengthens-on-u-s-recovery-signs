Taiwan ’s government bonds fell,
with benchmark 10-year yields rising the most since October, as
signs the  U.S. economy  is improving brightened the export
outlook and fueled demand for higher-yielding assets. The local
dollar weakened.  The  Federal Reserve  said yesterday it expects “moderate
economic growth” in the world’s largest economy and predicted
the  unemployment rate  will decline gradually. Global funds
bought $515 million more of the island’s stocks than they sold
today, the highest net purchases this month, according to
exchange data. The central bank, which left its  benchmark 
interest rate at 1.875 percent in December, will next review
monetary policy on March 22.  “Yields are going up as the global economy isn’t looking
that bad after all,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund
manager  at Uni-President Assets Management Corp., who helps
manage $1.6 billion of fixed-income securities. “The central
bank will probably keep interest rates unchanged.”  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent government bonds due
March 2022 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
1.279 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. That was
the biggest rise for  benchmark 10-year  yields since Oct. 24.  The government raised NT$40 billion ($1.4 billion) selling
20-year bonds at a yield of 1.708 percent yesterday, more than
the median 1.7 percent estimate in a Bloomberg survey. The
Ministry of Finance will release its second-quarter bond auction
plan on March 23.  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.549 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings that
traders use to price options, fell 0.1 to 4.60 percent.  The overnight  money-market  was little changed at 0.397
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
