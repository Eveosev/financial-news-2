The  New York Giants  signed former
Dallas Cowboys tight end Martellus Bennett, who may help them
fill the void left at the position when Jake Ballard and Travis
Beckum tore knee ligaments in the  Super Bowl .  Bennett, 25, was a backup to All-Pro tight end Jason Witten
in Dallas, where he totaled 85 receptions for 846 yards over
four National Football League seasons.  A second-round draft pick in 2008, Bennett received a one-
year contract worth $2.5 million from the Giants, ESPN reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
