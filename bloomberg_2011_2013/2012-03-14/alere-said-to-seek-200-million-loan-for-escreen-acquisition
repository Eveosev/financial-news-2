Alere Inc. (ALR) , a provider of health
management services, will hold a lender meeting tomorrow to
discuss a $200 million term loan the company is seeking to
support its acquisition of eScreen Inc., according to a person
with knowledge of the transaction.  Jefferies Group Inc. is arranging the financing for the
Waltham, Massachusetts-based company, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the terms are private.  Alere has agreed to acquire the  Overland Park , Kansas-based
provider of employee-related health testing products and
services for $270 million in cash, according to a Feb. 28
statement.  David Teitel, chief financial officer of Alere, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a  term loan  it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
