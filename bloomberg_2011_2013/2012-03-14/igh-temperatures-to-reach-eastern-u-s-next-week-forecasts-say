Temperatures in many parts of the
U.S. Northeast and Midwest may be 20 degrees Fahrenheit (11
Celsius) above normal next week, forecasters said.  New York , Chicago,  Washington  and Boston are expected to
reach 80 or above next week, according to MDA EarthSat Weather
in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  “Widespread anomalies exceeding 20 degrees above normal
will be common across the Midwest and Northeast, with some areas
likely to be as much as 30 degrees warmer than average,”
according to MDA’s forecast. “The most extreme warmth will be
found early in the central U.S.”  Traders watch temperature predictions to gauge energy use
and demand. Warm weather will drive up electricity use as people
turn on air conditioners. About 51 percent of U.S. households
use natural gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.  How long the hotter weather continues isn’t clear, said
 Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda, Maryland.  While temperatures in the East may be 8 degrees higher than
normal, computer models show some cooling is possible in the
March 24 to March 28 time frame, Rogers said in his 11- to 15-
day outlook.  “Given the strength of the current situation, we again
chose to take a cautious approach to bringing temperatures
lower,” Rogers said in a note to clients.  The normal average temperature in New York on March 21 is
about 44 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 40 in Boston and
Chicago, 48 in  St. Louis , 56 in Atlanta, 59 in Dallas, 64 in
Houston, 48 in  Seattle , and 59 in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
