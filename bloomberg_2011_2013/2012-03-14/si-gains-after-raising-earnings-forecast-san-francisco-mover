LSI Corp. (LSI) , the maker of chips used
in computer disk drives, jumped to the highest level in 4 1/2
years after raising its first-quarter sales prediction range,
citing a stronger-than-expected recovery in the industry.  First-quarter  sales  of $585 million to $615 million will
deliver a profit of 6 cents to 10 cents a share, the Milpitas,
California-based company said in a statement. LSI had predicted
sales of $550 million to $590 million.  The raised forecast reflects a rebound in the market for
hard disk drives, the main storage in personal computers, and
increasing shipments of semiconductors that control new drives
composed of memory chips, the company said.  LSI  rose  4.9 percent to $8.96 at 11:12 a.m. in  New York 
after reaching $9.03, the highest intraday price since June
2007. The stock had gained 44 percent this year before today.  Analysts predicted sales of $571.4 million and profit of
0.4 cent a share, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
