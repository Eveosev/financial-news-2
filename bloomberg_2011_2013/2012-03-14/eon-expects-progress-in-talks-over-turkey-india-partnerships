EON AG (EOAN) ,  Germany ’s biggest utility
that plans to expand in Brazil where energy demand is expected
to grow faster than in Europe, is in talks with potential
partners to enter  Turkey  and  India .  EON expects results from the discussions about possible
agreements in the course of this year, Chief Executive Officer
Johannes Teyssen said in a letter to shareholders today.  Germany’s largest utilities are overhauling operations
after the Fukushima disaster in Japan last March drove
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  to order the permanent closing of all
nuclear plants by 2022. The shutdown of nuclear stations in
EON’s home market trimmed earnings by 2.5 billion euros ($3.3
billion) in 2011 and drove the Dusseldorf-based utility to
announce a 15 billion-euro divestment program, job cuts and
plans to expand into new markets such as  Brazil .  It has also identified Turkey and India as attractive
markets, EON Chief Financial Officer Marcus Schenck said today
in Dusseldorf.  “Turkey is the market we’re most familiar with,” Schenck
said. While the utility could enter Turkey alone, it prefers to
do so with a partner, he said.  EON is also seeking a local partner for entering the market
in India, which is “much more difficult” than Turkey, he said.  EON agreed to buy 10 percent of Brazilian billionaire Eike
Batista’s MPX Energia SA and set up a power-generation joint
venture in January. The two companies plan to jointly generate
20,000 megawatts in Brazil and Chile and will each own 50
percent of the business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
