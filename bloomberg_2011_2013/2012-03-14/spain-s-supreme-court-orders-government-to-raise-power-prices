Spain ’s  Supreme Court  ordered the
government to raise the price of power for consumers to cover
more of the costs of delivery.  The ruling follows appeals by  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  and  Endesa SA (ELE) 
against the government’s decison to freeze power prices in
January, according to the court ruling.  The increase will be backdated to the start of January and
may raise revenue by at least 900 million euros ($1.2 billion),
