Serbia â€™s central bank sold 40
million euros ($52 million) to banks today, acting for the
second consecutive day as it tries to prop up the dinar.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it was acting
against the dinar volatility, not its trend, according to a
statement posted on its website.  The central bank began selling the common currency after
the dinar dropped to as low as 111.4350 to the euro in morning
trade. It set the dinar rate for tomorrow at 110.9698 to the
euro.  The National Bank of Serbia has spent 288.5 million euros
since the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar, which some
analysts see declining by 10 percent in 2012 as capital inflows
dry. It has lost more than 5 percent since early February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
