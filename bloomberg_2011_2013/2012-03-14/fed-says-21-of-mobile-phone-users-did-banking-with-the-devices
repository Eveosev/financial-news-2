The  Federal Reserve  said 21 percent
of U.S. consumers with mobile phones used the devices to access
a bank account, credit card or other financial account during
the 12 months that ended in January.  “The use of mobile banking is poised to expand further
over the next year, with usage possibly increasing to one out of
three mobile users by 2013,” the Fed said in a release today in
Washington. “However, the survey indicates that many consumers
remain skeptical of the benefit of mobile banking and the level
of security associated with the technology.”  The survey of 2,300 people was conducted between Dec. 22
and January 9 and showed that the use of mobile banking is
especially common among younger consumers. Forty-four percent of
people who access financial services on their phone are between
the ages of 18 and 29, the survey said.  “The majority of consumers who have a mobile phone but do
not use mobile banking said they either had no need for these
services or expressed security concerns,” the Fed said.  When asked about security, people who didn’t use mobile
banking said “they believed it was unsecure or that they simply
didn’t know how secure the technology was,” the Fed said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
