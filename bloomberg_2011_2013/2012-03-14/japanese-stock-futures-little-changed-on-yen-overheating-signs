Japanese  stock   futures  were little
changed as the yen’s drop to an 11-month low against the dollar
buoyed the earnings prospects for exporters, while a technical
indicator showed the nation’s shares have risen too fast after
the benchmark index hit an eight-month high yesterday.  American depositary receipts of  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ,  Japan ’s
second-largest carmaker by market value, rose 0.3 percent from
the closing share price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Sharp Corp. (6753) , a
Japanese electronics maker, slid 4 percent as it named its new
president after forecasting a record annual loss.  Newcrest
Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s biggest gold producer, led stocks lower
in Sydney, dropping 3.2 percent after gold prices tumbled.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 10,030 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 10,010
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,020 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index
fell 0.3 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index gained 0.9
percent in Wellington.  “Perhaps we are seeing a sustained devaluation of the yen,
which would improve the outlook for Japanese exporters in
particular,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion
in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “Perhaps what
we are seeing is a redirection of asset allocation toward Japan
because a lot of fund managers are underweight, and that’s
pushed up the market very quickly ahead of fundamentals.”  Yen, Exporters  The yen reached 83.83 per dollar yesterday, the lowest
level since April 14. A weaker yen boosts the value of Japanese
exporters’ profits overseas when repatriated.  The 14-day relative strength index for the Nikkei 225 rose
to about 77 yesterday, above the 70 threshold that some traders
say signals shares have been overbought and may fall.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent
today. The index lost 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday,
snapping a five-day advance that drove the benchmark gauge for
U.S. equities to the highest level since June 2008.  Concern that stock gains have outpaced economic prospects
rose as the  S&P 500  capped the best start to a year  since 1991 ,
amid better-than-estimated economic data and corporate earnings.  Gold futures for April delivery retreated 3 percent to
settle at $1,642.90 an ounce on the Comex in New York, the
biggest drop since Feb. 29. Earlier, prices slumped to
$1,639.20, the lowest since Jan. 17.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  rose 11.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 10.9 percent gain by the S&P
500 and a 10.5 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.

earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the S&P 500
and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of Chinese U.S.-listed
