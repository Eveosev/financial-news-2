European imports of containerized
goods fell 5.2 percent in January, as government austerity
programs led to the largest monthly contraction in the trade
since 2009, Container Trade Statistics Ltd. said.  Imports were about 1.8 million 20-foot boxes, compared with
1.9 million a year earlier, according to the Woking, England-
based provider of container shipping data. European exports
climbed almost 12 percent to 1.3 million boxes last month,  CTS 
said.  Monthly imports to the region haven’t fallen by so much
since 2009, Rod Riseborough, the company’s chief executive
officer, said today by phone.  “The austerity programs being implemented by governments
are more prevalent in Northern Europe and West Mediterranean,
the regions where volumes are down the most,” he said.  Imports to countries in these regions, including the U.K.,
 France ,  Spain ,  Italy  and ports in the Baltic and Adriatic
regions fell, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
