McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  is moving away
from discounting and coupons in the U.K. in favor of everyday
low prices to keep enticing cash-strapped Britons to its
restaurants, said Jill McDonald, head of that business.  “What is more important than one-off tactical vouchering
is having everyday affordable pricing,” the executive said in
an interview at the Retail Week Conference in  London  today.
“Over the last four years we have weaned ourselves off the big,
national buy-one-get-one-free-type deals.”  The world’s largest  restaurant chain , which has more than
1,200 stores in the U.K., is outperforming the market as it
focuses on value-for-money, she said. McDonald’s is adding 2,500
new staff this year, and is investing in improving service, food
quality and restaurant environments, the executive said.  “It is undoubtedly extremely tough for customers,” she
said, citing concern about unemployment. “It’s not going to get
easier anytime soon, so brands that can differentiate themselves
and can get that value-for-money equation right are the ones
that will win out.”  McDonald’s rose 0.3 percent to $97.09 at 10:19 a.m. in  New
York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
