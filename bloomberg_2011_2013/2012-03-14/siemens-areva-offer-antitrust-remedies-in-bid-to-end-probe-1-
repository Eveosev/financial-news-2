Areva SA (CEI)  and  Siemens AG (SIE)  have
offered antitrust remedies to the European Commission in a bid
to end a competition probe into contractual clauses they
concluded in a nuclear-reactor joint venture.  The companies have proposed changes to “non-compete and
confidentiality obligations” to curb Siemens’s exploitation of
Areva technology, according to a statement published on the
commission’s website. The commission said today it would seek
views on the measures in a so-called market test to see if they
would solve competition concerns.  “Siemens and Areva have proposed to reduce both the
product scope and the duration of the non-compete obligation,”
the commission said in an e-mailed statement.  The commission, the EU’s antitrust regulator, opened an
investigation in 2010 into whether contractual clauses between
Areva and Siemens may impede competition for certain products in
the civil nuclear technology industry.  The probe focused on clauses in place after Areva took full
control of Areva NP in 2009, a joint venture between it and
Siemens, the EU regulator said at the time.  The remedies that have been offered won’t result in any
payments by Siemens or financial obligations, said Alfons Benzinger, a spokesman for  Europe ’s biggest engineering company.  Siemens decided to end its involvement in nuclear
technology after the Fukushima disaster in  Japan  last year,
Benzinger said, meaning concessions offered to the commission in
this field wouldn’t have an effect on the company’s business.  Areva, based in Paris, declined to immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
