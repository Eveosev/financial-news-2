Russian scientists and a South
Korean colleague will attempt to clone a woolly mammoth from a
specimen frozen in the Siberian tundra for 10,000 years, RIA
Novosti reported.  The Institute of Applied Ecology in Siberia’s Yakutsk
region plan to implant genetic material from th mammoth into an
egg of a live female elephant, the state-run Russian news
service said.  The elephant will carry the fetus for 22 months and
“hopefully give birth to a live baby mammoth,” RIA cited an
unidentified official from the institute as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
