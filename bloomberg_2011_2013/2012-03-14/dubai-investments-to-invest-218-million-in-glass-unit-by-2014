Dubai Investments PJSC (DIC) , the owner
of stakes in more than 40 companies, said it plans to invest an
additional 800 million dirhams ($218 million) in its Glass LLC
unit to achieve 1 billion dirhams in sales by 2014.  The company expects the glassmaking unit’s sales to rise to
620 million dirhams this year from 400 million dirhams last
year, the company said in a statement today at an opening of a
new glass coating line in Dubai.  DI has already invested 1.5 billion dirhams in four glass
factories in the United Arab Emirates and the next years’
expenditure will be used to add capacity to a float glass
facility in Abu Dhabi as well as invest in glass companies in
Qatar, India and  Iraq .  To contact the reporters on this story:
