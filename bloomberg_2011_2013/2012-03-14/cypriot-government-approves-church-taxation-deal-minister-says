The Cypriot cabinet approved a deal
with the  Church of Cyprus  regulating the way it is taxed and
putting an end to a yearlong dispute, finance minister Kikis Kazamias said.  The tax dispute “separating the two most influential
institutions in Cyprus” was achieved after the ministry and the
east Mediterranean island’s Greek Orthodox Church agreed to
amend four points of a 2005 agreement which was never
implemented, Kazamias told reporters in Nicosia today.  The new deal, which is subject to approval by the Church’s
Holy Synod, regulates taxation on the institution’s real
property in the future and scraps churchmen’s right to duty free
cars, a privilege enjoyed by lawmakers, the minister said.  Cypriot auditor general Chrystalla Georghadji said in
December 2010 that the Church of Cyprus’s unpaid tax liabilities
amounted to 179 million euros ($233 million), a figure that the
Church disputed.  -- Editor: Digby Lidstone  To contact the reporter on this story:
