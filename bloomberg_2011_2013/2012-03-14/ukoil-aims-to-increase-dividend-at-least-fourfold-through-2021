OAO Lukoil (LKOH) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
oil producer, plans to raise dividend payments by 25 percent for
2011 and at least fourfold through 2021 at the same time as it
boosts  capital spending  to benefit from record fuel prices.  “We see an opportunity to increase dividends by at least
300 percent,” billionaire Chief Executive Officer  Vagit Alekperov  said at a strategy  presentation  in London today.  It paid 59 rubles a share for 2010, implying a 73.75 ruble
dividend for last year, less than an estimate by Bloomberg. The
proposal was in line with company earnings before interest,
taxation, depreciation and amortization in 2011, Artem Konchin,
an oil and gas analyst at  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , said by e-mail.  Lukoil, which exports about half its crude, advanced 0.3
percent to 1,922.20 rubles by the close of Moscow trading.  The announcement on dividends “disappointed,” Elena Savchik, an oil and gas analyst at Aton Capital, said today by
e-mail. “Spending also looks quite high.”  Lukoil, with the most overseas assets of any Russian  oil
company , seeks to expand output to benefit from higher prices.
It plans to spend $150 billion through 2021 in Iraq, Uzbekistan,
the  Caspian Sea  and Siberia to boost oil and gas production by
50 percent to 3.2 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.  The figure declined 4.4 percent last year to 2.14 million
barrels of oil equivalent a day because of aging oil fields. The
planned annual average spending of $15 billion is almost double
last year’s $8.5 billion, according to Lukoil’s figures.  The 10-year expansion program doesn’t envision growth in
borrowing ratios, Alekperov said. Iraq’s West Qurna-2 deposit,
which will get $25 billion in development funds, will become
self-financing in 2014, according to today’s presentation.  Crude oil will hold at record prices in the next decade as
use grows and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
seeks to maintain a level above $100 a barrel, said  Leonid Fedun , Moscow-based Lukoil’s deputy chief executive officer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
