Antonio Polverino, global head of
strategic financing and solutions at  Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc , has left the firm, according to a person briefed on
the departure.  Polverino couldn’t be reached on his office phone number
and an e-mail prompted an automatic reply saying he doesn’t have
access to his account. Officials at the firm in  London  declined
to comment.  Polverino joined RBS in 2009, according to the Financial
Services Authority register. He formerly worked at Bank of
America Corp., where he oversaw fixed income, currencies and
commodities sales for  Europe , and he was previously at JPMorgan
Chase & Co., where he held positions including head of the
interest-rate derivatives team. Financial News reported
Polverino’s departure earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
