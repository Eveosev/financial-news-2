The U.K. is asking oil-producing
nations to raise their output to offset a potential supply
shortfall, according to the country’s energy minister.  “We are encouraging countries with spare capacity to
increase production,” amid concern that tension over  Iran ’s
nuclear program may disrupt Middle East oil exports,  Charles Hendry  told reporters at a conference in Kuwait today.  “We’ve a whole range of other sanctions to Iran,” if the
country doesn’t comply with the international community on
pursuing a peaceful nuclear program, Hendry said. “The solution
to this situation is in the hands of Iran.”  He cited a “consistent message” from  Saudi Arabia  that
the kingdom is prepared to deliver additional oil supplies in
the event of a shortage.  To contact the reporters on this story:
