Turkey  is planning to sue Iran for
charging high prices on natural gas sales after final talks
between the neighbors failed, Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz  said.  Under the two countries’ contract, legal action is allowed
after March 16 and Turkey intends to file for arbitration
shortly thereafter, Yildiz told reporters in Kuwait after
meeting Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi, according to
Turkey’s state-run Anatolia  news agency .  Turkey pays a higher rate for gas to its eastern neighbor
than it does to Russia, Yildiz said, the news agency reported.
The price rose at the end of 2010 based on contractual
formulations, he said. Iran, Turkey’s second biggest natural gas
provider after Russia, has legal reservations on cutting prices,
the Turkish minister told reporters, according to Anatolia.  “I can’t say they’re ill intentioned,” Yildiz said of
Iranians. “Therefore our relations aren’t affected, I believe
they have good intentions and they believe the same for us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
