The Norwegian krone extended
declines against the dollar and euro after the nationâ€™s central
bank cut its benchmark  interest rate  by a quarter of a
percentage point to 1.5 percent.  The krone depreciated 1.3 percent to 5.7735 per dollar at
1:04 p.m. London time, after falling to 5.7830, the weakest
since Feb. 16. The currency fell 1.2 percent to 7.5472 per euro.  The decision was  forecast  by two of 16 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg, while the remaining 14 predicted no change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
