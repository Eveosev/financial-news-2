India ’s rupee strengthened for a
second day on speculation international investors will buy the
nation’s assets after the government reported the slowest
 manufacturing inflation  in a year.  Funds based abroad added $278 million to holdings of Indian
shares on March 12, exchange data show. Prices of factory goods
rose 5.75 percent in February from a year earlier, the slowest
pace since January 2011, a commerce ministry report showed
today. Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  will release on March
16 the budget for the year starting April 1.  “There is an expectation of equity inflows,” said Vikas Babu, a currency trader at state-owned  Andhra Bank . “With the
budget to be announced this week, the rupee will not move much
in either direction till we have more clarity.”  The rupee advanced 0.1 percent to 49.9050 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency
will trade between 49.80 to 50.05 until the budget is presented,
according to Babu.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was unchanged at 9.75 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Three-month onshore forward contracts traded at 50.99 a
dollar, compared with 51.00 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 51.05 from 51.00. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
