The  New York Knicks  signed a
marketing partnership with  Acer (2353)  Inc., the fourth-largest
computer maker, marking the National Basketball Association
team’s second affiliation with a Taiwan-based company since
Jeremy Lin joined the starting lineup last month.  The Harvard University-educated Lin, who is of Taiwanese
descent, has helped to fuel gains in merchandise sales and
television ratings since starting his first game on Feb. 6. His
jersey is the No. 1 seller in the NBA since Feb. 4, the league
said, declining to give specifics.  The Knicks signed a marketing sponsorship with Maxxis
International, a tire company, last month.  The agreement with Acer expires after the season. As part
of the contract, Acer will place advertisements near the Knicks’
bench.  Lin, 23, wasn’t drafted and was cut by two teams before
joining the Knicks, who won six consecutive games after he
became a starter.  New York has now lost its last six games, falling into a
tie with  Milwaukee  for the eighth and final playoff spot in the
Eastern Conference.  The Knicks host the Portland Trail Blazers tonight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
