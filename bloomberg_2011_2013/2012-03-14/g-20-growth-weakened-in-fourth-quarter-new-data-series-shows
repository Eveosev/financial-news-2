Economic expansion in Group of 20
countries slowed in the fourth quarter, according to a new
statistical series published by seven international
institutions.  Gross domestic product in the G-20 nations rose 0.7 percent
in the final three months of 2011 from the previous quarter,
when it increased 0.9 percent, according to the data released in
Paris and  Washington  today by the  International Monetary Fund ,
the Bank for International Settlements, the  European Central
Bank , Eurostat, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, the United Nations and the  World Bank .  G-20 growth of 2.8 percent for the whole of 2011 showed “a
marked deceleration compared with the 5 percent growth in
2010,” the institutions said in a statement. “The G-20 GDP
aggregate masks diverging patterns among the world’s largest
economies.”  The G-20 is composed of industrial and emerging economies
and accounts for about 85 percent of the world economy. While
the U.S. returned to growth and economies including India and
Indonesia expanded strongly, the European Union and Japan
contracted in the same period, the report showed. China’s
economic growth slowed to 2 percent from 2.3 percent in the
third quarter.  The new data will be part of the OECD’s quarterly release
on economic growth, published regularly about 70 days after the
end of each quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
