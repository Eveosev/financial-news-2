Stada Arzneimittel AG (SAZ)  failed in two
takeover attempts in  Russia  over the last two years after months
of exclusive talks, Reuters reported, citing unidentified people
familiar with the negotiations.  The German drugmaker in 2010 dropped a potential merger
with Russiaâ€™s OAO  Pharmstandard (PHST)  and a year ago decided against
buying Valenta in a deal valued at about $400 million, Reuters
said. Stada declined to comment, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
