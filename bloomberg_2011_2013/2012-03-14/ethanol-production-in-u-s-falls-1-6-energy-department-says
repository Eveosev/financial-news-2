Ethanol output in the U.S. fell 1.6
percent to 892,000 barrels a day, the lowest level in five
months, the Energy Department said today.  Production (DOETFETH)  sank the most since the week ended Feb. 24 and
to the lowest amount since October 7.  Stockpiles (DOESFETH)  fell to 22
million barrels, the first decline since Dec. 9, the department
said in a report released in  Washington  today.  Production of  conventional gasoline blended with ethanol 
climbed 1.6 percent to 5.14 million barrels a day, the
department said.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery advanced 1.7 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $2.311 a gallon yesterday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest price since Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
