Mol Nyrt. (MOL) ,  Hungary ’s largest oil
refiner, rose for a sixth day, poised for the longest stretch of
gains in almost two months, as Wood & Co. said the stock price
doesn’t take into account assets in  Iraq .  The shares gained 0.7 percent to 19,535 forint by 11:36
a.m. in Budapest. A close at that level would be its highest in
more than a month and mark the longest rising streak for Mol
since the eight days ended Jan. 23.  Mol’s share-price estimate was increased to 23,300 forint
from 22,950 forint, Robert Rethy, a Prague-based analyst at Wood
& Co., said in a report today that maintained the company’s buy
 rating . The brokerage estimated Mol’s new oil wells in the Iraqi
region of Kurdistan are worth about $2 billion, or 4,600 forint
a share, Rethy said.  While the Iraqi assets “should not add any material
earnings until approximately 2015,” they “are not yet
reflected fully by the share price,” Rethy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
