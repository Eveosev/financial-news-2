The U.S. Treasury Department said
it will sell preferred stock in six banks acquired during the
financial crisis through the Troubled Asset Relief Program.  The Treasury said it would conduct public auctions to sell
its stakes in Banner Corp. of Walla Walla,  Washington ; First
Financial Holdings Inc. of Charleston,  South Carolina ;
MainSource Financial Group Inc., of Greensburg, Indiana;
Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida, in Stuart, Florida;
Wilshire Bancorp Inc. of Los Angeles; and WSFS Financial Corp.
of Wilmington, Delaware.  Treasury expects to conduct the auctions on or about March
26, it said today in a release in Washington. The Treasury will
use a modified Dutch auction methodology. Houlihan Lokey Capital
Inc. is the Treasuryâ€™s financial adviser on the transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
