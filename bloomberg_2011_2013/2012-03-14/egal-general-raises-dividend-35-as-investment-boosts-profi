Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN) , the
fourth-biggest U.K. insurer by market value, boosted its
dividend 35 percent as profit beat analysts’ estimates on growth
in the U.S. and fees for investment-management products.  The  shares  jumped to the highest since 2008, the year the
company cut its dividend amid the financial crisis. Operating
profit rose 5 percent to 1.06 billion pounds ($1.7 billion) in
the 12 months to Dec. 31, the London-based company said today,
above the 1.05 billion-pound median estimate of 14 analysts in a
Bloomberg  survey . The insurer raised its full-year dividend to
6.4 pence a share, higher than 2007’s previous record payout.  The firm has scope to lift its dividend by a similar level
next year should market conditions allow it, Chief Executive
Officer Tim Breedon said on a call with reporters. Legal &
General, the biggest investor in the U.K. stock market, has
increased its fee-based savings business by a third and boosted
profit at the division more than 10-fold in the last four years.  “This finally lays to rest the ghost of the 2008 dividend
cut,”  Eamonn Flanagan , a Liverpool, England-based analyst at
Shore Capital Group Ltd. who recommends buying the stock, wrote
in a note to clients today. “Legals reported a powerful set of
2011 results.”  The full-year dividend beat the analysts’ estimate of 5.94
pence and the 2007 payout of 5.97 pence. In 2008, the dividend
was cut by a third. The current dividend payout is covered 2.25
times by net cash generation, and the firm intends to reduce
this ratio to 2 times, Breedon said.  Shares Surge  The stock  climbed  as much as 5.5 percent, the steepest
increase since Oct. 27, and was up 4.9 percent to 131.4 pence as
of 9 a.m. in London trading, valuing the company at about 7.7
billion pounds.  Legal & General, founded as a life insurer in 1836, is
betting that the aging British population’s demand for savings,
pensions and annuities will increase as the government reduces
state retirement provisions and companies close so-called final
salary pension plans.  The focus on the savings business has helped rebalance the
company away from annuities, which carry more  investment risk .
The company has tripled the amount of cash it generates since
2007 by cutting costs, reducing commissions paid to sales
advisers and withdrawing money-losing products.  The shares are on pace to close at the highest level since
April 2008. Legal & General also had the biggest advance in the
pan-European  Stoxx 600’s index of insurers .  Liability Management  Operating profit at the company’s investment-management
division rose 14 percent to 234 million pounds as pension funds’
demand for liability-management products increased. Profit at
the company’s international business grew 34 percent to 137
million pounds, driven by growth in the U.S.  Liability-management products are swaps and hedges that
reduce the risks of volatile  interest rates , equity markets and
policy holders living longer than expected.  “Pension scheme de-risking was the big theme of 2011,
which drove a lot of the growth in the numbers and
profitability,” Breedon said.  Net income declined to 723 million pounds from 820 million
pounds a year earlier as the company took losses from marking
the value of some of its interest-rate hedges to market prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
