Center Andrew Bogut is moving to
the  Golden State Warriors  in a trade with the  Milwaukee Bucks ,
the  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported .  The Bucks also sent 33-year-old guard Stephen Jackson to
the Warriors in return for shooting guard Monta Ellis, forward
Ekpe Udoh and the expiring contract of Kwame Brown, the
newspaper said, citing a person within the  National Basketball
Association  it didn’t identify.  Warriors spokesman Raymond Ridder said in an e-mail that he
had no immediate comment on the newspaper’s report.  Milwaukee  (18-24) is tied with the  New York Knicks  for the
eighth and final playoff spot in the NBA’s Eastern Conference.
The Warriors (18-21) are 13th of the 15 teams in the Western
Conference.  Bogut was taken by the Bucks with the No. 1 overall pick in
the 2005 NBA draft. The 27-year-old Australian has been limited
by injuries to one full 82-game season, his first in the NBA. He
was hampered by a back problem in 2008, missed the end of the
2009-10 season with a dislocated right elbow and broken right
hand, and fractured his ankle in January.  In 408 NBA games, Bogut has averaged 12.7 points per game
and 9.3 rebounds. Jackson, who previously played for Golden
State in 2006-10, has averaged 16.1 points in 773 career games.  Ellis, 26, has averaged 19.6 points in 413 games, all for
the Warriors, and Udoh, 24, has averaged 4.6 points in 96 games
over two seasons with Golden State.  Brown was acquired because his $7 million expiring deal
helped to balance the numbers in the trade, the Journal Sentinel
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
