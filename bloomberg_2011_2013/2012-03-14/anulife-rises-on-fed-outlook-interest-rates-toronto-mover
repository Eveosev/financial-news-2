Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , Canada’s
largest insurer, rose the most in about five months after yields
on 30-year bonds climbed and U.S.  Federal Reserve  policy makers
raised its outlook.  Manulife jumped 6.7 percent to C$13.50 at 4 p.m. in trading
on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It was the biggest one-day gain
for the Toronto-based company since Oct. 27.  The owner of Boston-based John Hancock Financial has been
more sensitive to interest-rate declines than some of its
domestic competitors, reporting two straight quarterly net
losses. Falling rates reduce investment income while increasing
costs from obligations to clients who bought guaranteed
investment products.  “As long-term rates back up and as equity markets move up
tied to a better economic outlook, life insurers will release a
whole batch of reserves into their income,” said Peter Routledge, an analyst at National Bank Financial in Toronto. He
rates Manulife shares ‘sector perform’  The Federal Reserve raised its assessment of the economy
yesterday as the labor market gathers strength. Yields on 30-
year bonds climbed as much as 11 basis points to 3.38 percent,
the most in more than four months.  Other Canadian insurers also rose.  Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) 
climbed 4.5 percent,  Great-West Lifeco Inc. (GWO)  advanced 2.5 percent
and Industrial Alliance Insurance and Financial Services Inc.
jumped 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
