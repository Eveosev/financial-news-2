It was painful to watch: Energy Secretary Steven Chu, onetime advocate of higher  gas prices , explaining his change of heart at a Senate hearing this week. Asked by Senator  Mike Lee , Republican of Utah, about his oft-cited  2008 statement  that "somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in  Europe " to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, on Tuesday  Chu said : "I no longer share that view." Whence the epiphany? First, Chu left academia a few months after that interview to head the DOE. Second, gas prices have shot up to $3.81 a gallon,  according to AAA . Third, his boss is facing reelection with  polls  showing prices at the pump and Obama's popularity moving in opposite directions. So what's a good Cabinet secretary to do? Take one for the team, of course. "When I became secretary of Energy, I represented the U.S. government," Chu said at the hearing of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "Of course we donâ€™t want the price of gasoline to go up, we want it to go down." Of course we don't! At his March 6  press conference , President  Barack Obama  was asked about his suspected support for higher gas prices to make alternative energy more competitive. "Just from a political perspective, do you think the president of the United States going into re-election wants gas prices to go up higher?" Obama said. I'm glad he included that phrase "from a political perspective." Otherwise, the public might be fooled by his actions, such as  his lobbying  of Senate Democrats to reject the Keystone XL oil pipeline, into thinking he -- and his energy secretary -- really do harbor a preference for higher gas prices.
