EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal has begun
restricting accounts of people it suspects of using the payment
service to place bets on National Collegiate Athletic
Association basketball championship tournament.  PayPal has sent alerts to some users who have used the
service in connection with March Madness wagers, saying that
their account use has been “limited.”  “After a recent review of your account activity, it has
been determined that you are in violation of PayPal’s Acceptable
Use Policy regarding your sales / offers of March Madness sports
pool,” a representative of PayPal’s brand risk management
division wrote in an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News.  The user agreement for PayPal, EBay’s fastest growing
business, prohibits U.S. account use for sending or receiving
payments for “activities that involve gaming and/or any other
activity with an entry fee and a prize.” The widely followed
men’s college basketball  championship  kicks off this week.  The e-mail asks the user to sign an online “Acceptable Use
Policy affidavit” to regain full use of the account.  Bergen Kay, a spokeswoman for  San Jose , California-based
PayPal, declined to comment on how the company’s system
identifies alleged gamblers.  “PayPal follows all the legal and regulatory rules in the
U.S. as it relates to gambling,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
