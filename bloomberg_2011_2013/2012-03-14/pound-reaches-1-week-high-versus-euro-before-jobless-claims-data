U.K. gilts fell, pushing 10-year
yields up by the most since September, as the  Federal Reserve ’s
decision to raise its U.S. growth outlook fueled bets central
banks will refrain from announcing any more bond purchases.  Two-year notes dropped for a second day even after a
 government report  showed the number of Britons claiming jobless
benefits rose more than economists predicted. Morgan Stanley
told its clients to favor German bunds over gilts on speculation
the U.K. economy will recover faster than the euro area,
reducing the likelihood of more quantitative easing from the
 Bank of England . The U.K. will sell 30-year bonds tomorrow.  “If we haven’t got the support from new QE, which is
looking more 50-50, then yields can sell off in comparison to
bunds,” said Anthony O’Brien, a fixed-income strategist at
Morgan Stanley in  London . “We have a 30-year option tomorrow,
so the long end might be feeling a bit weaker.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose 17 basis points, or 0.17
percentage point, to 2.34 percent at 4:28 p.m. London time, the
highest since Dec. 6. Yields rose by the most since Sept. 13 on
a closing basis. The 4 percent bond due March 2022 fell 1.68, or
16.80 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,567) face amount, to 114.64.  Two-year yields gained five basis points to 0.52 percent
after reaching 0.54 percent, the most since Nov. 11.  ‘Moderate‘ Growth  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said yesterday it expects
“moderate economic growth” and predicted the  unemployment rate 
“will decline gradually.” In its previous statement in
January, policy makers said growth would be “modest” and
unemployment “will decline only gradually.”  The announcement came after a U.S. report showed retail
sales advanced 1.1 percent in February, the most in five months.
The Treasury  10-year (USGG10YR)  yield increased six basis points today to
2.19 percent.  The  extra yield  investors get for holding 10-year gilts
instead of similar-maturity bunds was 39 basis points, up from
19 basis points a month ago. The U.K. bonds yield 10 basis
points more than 10-year Treasuries.  Unemployment-benefit claims climbed by 7,200 from January
to 1.612 million, the statistics office said in London.
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast a gain of 5,000.
 Unemployment (UKUEILOR)  measured by International Labour Organization
methods held at 8.4 percent in the three months through January,
the highest since 1995.  Pound Gains  The pound rose 0.3 percent to 83.08 pence per euro after
advancing to 82.95 pence, the strongest since Feb. 17. The U.K.
currency lost 0.2 percent to $1.5677.  Britain is proposing to revive “perpetual gilts” to allow
the government to borrow for as long as possible at record-low
rates, according to two people familiar with budget discussions.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  will use his
March 21 budget to announce a consultation on introducing
government bonds of up to 100 years and reviving debt with no
fixed maturity, the people said.  Such securities “offer certainty and balance to arguably
more volatile assets, such as corporate bonds and equities, and
there will be demand from banks and pension funds,”  Mike Turner , head of strategy at Aberdeen Asset Management in
Edinburgh, wrote in a note to clients. “But history has also
shown that when debt issuers attempt to lock in such low levels
of short term interest rates in perpetuity or for extremely long
periods, that it could be a sign of the bottoming out of the
interest-rate cycle.”  The 10-year  gilt yield  is almost two percentage points
below its 4.21 percent average for the past decade, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The yield declined to a record 1.92
percent on Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
