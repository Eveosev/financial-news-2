GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  Chief Executive
Officer  Andrew Witty ’s total compensation last year almost
doubled as the company’s stock returned 25 percent in 2011.  Witty earned 6.78 million pounds ($10.7 million), an 84
percent increase from a year earlier, mostly as the London-based
company awarded a higher bonus and more shares, according to
Glaxo’s  annual report . Witty’s pay consisted of 1 million pounds
in base salary, a 2 million-pound bonus and 3.74 million pounds
in shares, the drugmaker said in the report.  Witty helped generate “the company’s best annual total
shareholder return since the formation of GSK in 2000,” Glaxo
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
