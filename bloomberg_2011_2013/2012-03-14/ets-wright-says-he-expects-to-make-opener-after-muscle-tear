New York Mets third baseman  David Wright  said he expects to be ready for the Major League Baseball
team’s opening day as he recovers from a torn abdominal muscle.  Wright, 29, told reporters today at the team’s spring
training facility in Port St. Lucie, Florida, that he has a
strained stomach muscle, or minor tear near his rib cage, team
spokesman  Jay Horwitz  confirmed in an e-mail. Wright said he
expects to be ready for the team’s first regular-season game on
April 5 at Citi Field against the  Atlanta Braves .  Wright has missed the first week of spring training games
because of the injury. He received a cortisone shot in New York
on March 12, according to ESPN, and Horwitz said there is no
timetable for his return to the field.  An All-Star each season from 2006 to 2010, Wright has hit
.300 with 183 home runs in his eight-year career spent entirely
with the Mets. Last season, he was second on the team in home
runs (14) and runs batted in (61), trailing outfielder  Carlos Beltran  in both categories.  To contact the reporter on this story:
