Slovakia’s 20011 budget deficit
probably will be revised to 5 percent of gross domestic product
from 4.6 percent as originally reported,  Sme  reported, citing
Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir Tvaroska.  Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical office, will ask
the government to also include in the 2011 deficit old debts of
public hospitals and the state railway, the newspaper reported
citing Tvaroska.  To contact the reporter on this story:
