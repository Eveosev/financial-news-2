The following table shows the 22-
day moving average of the three crude benchmark grades monitored
by the Chinese government for setting fuel prices. The average,
assuming an equal weighting for all three grades, rose 8.9
percent as of yesterday from the last adjustment on Feb. 7.  Gasoline, diesel and kerosene tariffs may be modified when
the 22-day moving average of Brent, Dubai and Cinta changes more
than 4 percent from the last official price revision, under a
mechanism introduced by the government, which hasn’t given the
weighting for the grades. Prices are in U.S. dollars a barrel
and are according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
