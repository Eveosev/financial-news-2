Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , owner of the most
popular U.S. Internet portal, put Chief Financial Officer Tim Morse on the board of  Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (ALIBABZ) .  Morse took the position that was vacated by  Jerry Yang  when
he stepped down in January, Dana Lengkeek, a spokeswoman for
Yahoo, said today. She declined to specify when Morse occupied
the role, and John Spelich, a Hong Kong-based Alibaba spokesman,
referred questions to Yahoo.  Yang left Yahoo’s board as well as those of Alibaba and
Yahoo Japan Corp. in January amid investor criticism as the U.S.
company failed to find a buyer or negotiate a sale of stakes in
its Asian assets worth more than $10 billion. Yahoo owns about
40 percent of closely-held Alibaba Group, China’s biggest e-
commerce company.  That gives Yahoo two seats on Alibaba’s board, while the
company traditionally only fills one, Lengkeek said.  Morse had served as Yahoo’s interim chief executive officer
after the September ouster of  Carol Bartz , until  Scott Thompson 
was hired for the role in January.  Yahoo is in “discussions regarding the possibility of
restructuring our holdings in Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan,”
the U.S. company said in its annual report filed Feb. 29.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
