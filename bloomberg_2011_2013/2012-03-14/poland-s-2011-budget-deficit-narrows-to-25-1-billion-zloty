Poland ’s central government budget
deficit narrowed last year to 25.1 billion zloty ($7.94
billion), or 62.5 percent of the limit in the 2011 budget law,
the Warsaw-based  Finance Ministry  said today.  Budget revenue reached 277.6 billion zloty, 1.6 percent
above the budget target, while spending totaled 302.7 billion
zloty, or 96.6 percent of the plan, the ministry said in an e-
