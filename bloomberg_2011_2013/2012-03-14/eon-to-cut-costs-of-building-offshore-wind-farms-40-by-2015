EON AG (EOAN) ,  Germany ’s biggest utility,
expects to cut costs for building offshore wind farms about 40
percent by 2015 as it embarks on a 7 billion-euro ($9 billion)
renewable energy expansion plan.  EON, which today said that 2011 profit slumped 50 percent
in part on the German nuclear exit and lower earnings from its
power generation and wholesale gas business, will commission as
much as 800 megawatts of renewable capacity this year, Chief
Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen said in Dusseldorf.  “Renewables are a mainstay of our corporate strategy, and
wind power in particular is one of our growth businesses,”
Teyssen said at company headquarters.  The utility plans to invest 7 billion euros to expand its
clean-energy generation capacity in the next five years as
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  decided to shut the country’s
nuclear power reactors by 2022 after Japan’s disaster. EON seeks
to build wind farms off the U.K., Scandinavia and German
coastlines, including the 1-billion euro Amrumbank West project
in the North Sea that  Siemens AG (SIE) ,  Europe ’s largest engineering
company, will supply with 80 of its wind turbines.  “We intend to commission a new offshore wind farm every 18
months,” Teyssen said.  EON at the end of last year owned about 9 gigawatts of
renewable generation capacity, 4.8 gigawatts of which were hydro
stations. The utility’s renewable energy unit saw earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rise 21
percent to 1.5 billion euros as more  wind turbines  were
installed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
