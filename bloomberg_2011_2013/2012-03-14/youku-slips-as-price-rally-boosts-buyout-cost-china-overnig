Youku Inc. (YOKU)  slid the most in more
than a month, leading declines in Chinese companies traded in
the U.S., on speculation the nation’s largest video sharing
website may be paying too much for  Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO)   Youku, which announced plans on March 12 to acquire smaller
competitor Tudou in a stock swap, tumbled the most since Jan. 31
and was the biggest decliner on the  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) 
of Chinese U.S.-listed shares. The gauge dropped 2.3 percent to
104.25 yesterday in New York. China Life Insurance Co. traded at
a discount to its  Hong Kong  stock for the first time in six days
after reporting that premium income dropped in the first two
months of this year from a year ago.  Youku’s 15 percent advance since the merger announcement
has  boosted  the cost of the takeover by 27 percent to $1.18
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Holders of
Tudou’s American depositary receipts will receive 1.595 ADRs of
Youku for each Tudou ADR they own, the two companies said in a
joint statement on March 12.  “Investors are selling because they are recognizing that
Youku is paying a hefty premium that may not be justified today
given Tudou’s fundamentals,” said Kevin Pollack, a  fund manager 
at Paragon Capital LP in  New York , which invests in U.S.-listed
Chinese stocks. “After the big run-up of both stocks,
especially Tudou, some profit taking is to be expected.”  The price move means Beijing-based Youku is paying the most
expensive announced takeover premium among pending deals, with
its own rise over the past three days giving arbitragers a
chance to make a 15 percent profit, the most for comparable
stock transactions on a global basis, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  ‘Excellent and Cool’  Youku, meaning “excellent and cool” in Chinese, fell 8.3
percent to $28.79 in New York yesterday, extending its two-day
slide to 9.6 percent. Shanghai-based Tudou, which had lost about
half its value through March 9 after going public in the U.S. in
August, has jumped 159 percent this week. The company, whose
name means potato in Chinese, retreated 6.1 percent to $39.90
yesterday, snapping a five-day increase.  Some investors “are fearful that advertising revenues may
not meet expectations if  China  experiences lower growth,”
Pollack said.  “Tudou has not been a Tier-1 player in terms of fighting
for the hottest content,” C. Ming Zhao, an analyst at
Susquehanna International Group LLP, said in a March 12 report.  China, the world’s second-largest  economy , expanded 8.9
percent in the last three months of 2011, the slowest pace in 10
quarters.  Housing ‘Chaos’  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said yesterday that  home prices 
remain far from a reasonable level and relaxing curbs would lead
to “chaos,” at a press conference in Beijing after the annual
meeting of the National People’s Congress. On March 5, Wen cut
this year’s economic growth target to 7.5 percent from 8 percent
in the previous seven years.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 3.2 percent to $38.67,
the biggest one-day loss in a week. The  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  was little changed at 1,394.28.  ADRs of of  Sky-Mobi Ltd. (MOBI) , a Chinese provider of mobile-
phone applications, fell 1.8 percent to $3.88 after gaining 8.2
percent over the previous four days in New York.  Sales will be unchanged in the fiscal year ending March 31,
2013 as the market for lower-end feature phones shrinks, Chief
Financial Officer Carl Yeung said in an interview at Bloomberg’s
headquarters in New York yesterday.  Smartphone Sales  China has sold about 300 million mobile devices in the past
12 months, of which more than 90 percent were feature phones,
Yeung said. The situation will change this year as sales of
smartphones, which have computer-like capabilities for running
software and accessing websites, may rise to about 30 percent of
the mobile-phone market, he said.  Sky-Mobi will benefit from increasing sales of smartphones
starting from September this year, Yeung said. Contributions
from smartphone applications to revenue will become
“significant” in 2013, he said.  Sales for the quarter ended Dec. 31 rose 3.8 percent from
the same period a year ago to 167.3 million yuan ($26.6
million), Sky-mobi, based in Hangzhou in China’s eastern
Zhejiang province, said in a Feb. 15 statement. Net income
dropped 96.6 percent from a year ago to 6.4 million yuan.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 2.6 percent, the most
since Nov. 30, to 2,391.23 yesterday, while the  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  for Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong
declined 0.5 percent to 11,300.41.  ADRs of China Life, the nation’s largest insurer, fell 2.7
percent to $40.55 in New York. The depositary receipts, each
representing 15 common shares, traded 1 percent  below  China
Life’s Hong Kong stock, the first discount in six days. China
Life climbed 0.2 percent in Hong Kong yesterday to HK$21.20, the
equivalent of $2.73 per share.  Beijing-based China Life received 79.4 billion yuan ($12.5
billion) of premium income in January and February, according to
a  statement  to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. That
compared with 84.6 billion yuan for the same period of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
