Champagne demand may accelerate
this year as London hosts the  Olympic Games  and consumers in
emerging markets drink more of the sparkling wine, according to
an industry group.  The Olympic host country saw orders rise about 10 percent
on average during the last five rounds of games, said Francoise Peretti, director of the Champagne Bureau, the U.K. arm of  Comite
Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne . Shipments to the U.K. 
also rose 26 percent in 2002 as revelers celebrated Queen Elizabeth II’s Golden Jubilee, she said.  “Champagne is the ultimate drink of celebration,” Peretti
said in a phone interview. With the Olympics and the Queen’s
Diamond Jubilee taking place this year in the U.K., “we can be
expecting the first export market to be drinking its fair
share.”  Meanwhile, surging wealth in Russia,  Latin America  and Asia
“is fueling the appetite for luxury goods and champagne is part
of the super-premium experience,” she said.  Champagne shipments increased 1.1 percent to 323 million
bottles last year, according to CIVC. Exports rose 5.2 percent,
more than compensating for a 1.9 percent decline in France and a
2.7 percent drop in the U.K., the industry group said.  In France, where volume was 181.6 million bottles last
year, the market is expected to be “fairly stable” in 2012,
according to Peretti. Orders slowed in the last two months of
2011 amid concern about austerity measures, she said.  Tasting 6,000 Bottles  While champagne remains a French drink with a strong U.K.
and U.S. following, interest is “definitely continuing” in
 emerging markets , Peretti also said. In 2011, shipments surged
59 percent in India, 32 percent in Australia, 25 percent in
Russia, 19 percent in  China , 15 percent in  Hong Kong  and 14
percent in the U.S., according to CIVC.  “We know it’s going to grow steadily,” Peretti said of
demand from emerging markets.  Laurent Perrier SA (LPE) , the maker of Grand Siecle champagne,
said in December that orders may deteriorate as  Europe ’s debt
crisis weighs on consumption this year. Shipments of the
sparkling wine slowed in the last two months of 2011, Chief
Financial Officer Etienne Auriau said at the time.  The Champagne Bureau holds its annual trade and media
tasting today at Banqueting House in  London , where 79 brands
will present 233 cuvees with vintages ranging from 1998 to 2007,
uncorking more than 6,000 bottles. The event is the largest of
its kind in Europe, according to the industry group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
