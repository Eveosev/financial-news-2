Auriga Industries (AURIB) , the biggest
Danish chemicals maker, dropped the most in more than six months
in Copenhagen trading after its 2012 forecast raised concern
over long-term financial targets.  The Lemvig, Denmark-based company fell as much as 6.2
percent, the steepest decline since August 26. The shares fell
4.5 kroner, or 5.6 percent, to 76 kroner at 2:06 p.m. in the
Danish capital.  Auriga said 2012 earnings before interest and tax will be
in a range of 350 million kroner ($62 million) to 450 million
kroner,  missing  the average estimate of 529 million kroner in a
Bloomberg survey of six analysts.  “At best they’ll reach the lower end of consensus on EBIT,
and that’s disappointing.” said Soeren Loentoft Hansen, an
equity analyst at Sydbank A/S in Aabenraa,  Denmark . “The share
price drop is justified, as it questions whether the company can
achieve its long-term financial targets.”  Those targets include annual sales growth of 10 percent
every year after 2013 and a margin on earnings before interest
taxes, depreciation and amortization of 13 percent to 18
percent. The EBITDA margin was 8.7 percent in 2011.  The maker of plant protection chemicals and spraying
equipment also said 2012 revenue will be about 6 billion kroner,
compared with an average estimate of 6.1 billion kroner in the
survey.  Loentoft said revenue growth in the fourth quarter also
disappointed, as sales dropped while crop prices were steady.  Auriga reported 2011 EBIT of 318 million kroner after
having posting preliminary EBIT figures 320 million kroner on
Jan. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
