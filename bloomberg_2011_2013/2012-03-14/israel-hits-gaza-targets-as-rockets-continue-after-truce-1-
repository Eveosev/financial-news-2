The Israeli  air force  struck two
“terror activity sites” in the  Gaza Strip  overnight in
response to continued rocket attacks from Gaza even after
yesterday’s reported truce to end four days of violence.  At least eight rockets have struck Israel since the report
of the cease-fire early yesterday, an army spokeswoman said,
speaking anonymously in accordance with military regulation. One
person was lightly injured by rocket shrapnel in the southern
city of Netivot and several people were treated for shock, the
spokesman said.  Israel and the Palestinians reached an understanding
yesterday to end four days of fighting in Gaza after Israeli air
strikes killed at least 24 people and militants fired about 200
rockets from the coastal enclave, wounding four people.  “Our message is clear: quiet will bring quiet,” Prime
Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said yesterday in  Jerusalem .
“Whoever violates it or even tries to violate it -- we will
find him.”  This month’s bloodshed began with a March 9 Israeli air
strike on what the army said were two militants planning an
attack from the Egyptian-controlled Sinai, including Zuhir al-
Qaisi, head of the Popular Resistance Committees. The rocket
attacks and air strikes that followed have been the worst since
August, when eight Israelis were killed in an attack near the
resort of Eilat and at least 24 Palestinians died in subsequent
air raids.  Israel said it holds the Hamas Islamic movement responsible
for all attacks emanating from the territory. Hamas, which has
ruled Gaza since 2007, is considered a terrorist group by the
U.S.,  Israel  and the European Union.
