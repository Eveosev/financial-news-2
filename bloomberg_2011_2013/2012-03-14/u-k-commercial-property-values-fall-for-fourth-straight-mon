U.K. commercial real estate values
fell for the fourth straight month in February on concern that
Britain’s economy was slipping into recession for the second
time in three years, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses
declined 0.3 percent last month from January, IPD said in a
statement today. Retail properties led the drop, declining 0.4
percent. Total return, which combines the change in property
values and rental income, rose 0.3 percent from a month ago.  “Weakening occupier demand underlies this month’s fall in
values, and outside of  London  this is now having a notable drag
on performance,” Phil Tily, managing director at London-based
IPD, said in the statement.  The lack of demand for new buildings, combined with tighter
credit and a wave of job cuts by financial-services companies,
will prevent some London developments from going ahead, EC
Harris LLP said last month. Developers returned to office
construction in 2010 following the global financial crisis,
betting that tenants would choose new buildings when their
leases ended.  Editors: Jeff St.Onge, Ross Larsen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
