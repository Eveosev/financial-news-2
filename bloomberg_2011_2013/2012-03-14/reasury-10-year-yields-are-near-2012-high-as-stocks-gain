Treasuries dropped, pushing 10-year
note yields to the highest level since October, a day after the
 Federal Reserve  raised its assessment of the  U.S. economy  and
sapped demand for the safety of government debt.  Ten- (USGG10YR)  and 30-year yields rose past their 200-day moving
averages for the first time since July, suggesting bond prices
may decline further. A gauge of investor expectations for
 inflation  climbed to the highest in seven months. Thirty-year
bonds dropped before a $13 billion sale of the debt.  “Very few were expecting the changes that we got from the
Fed’s language yesterday, so the fact that they were a little
more upbeat was a negative for Treasuries,” said  Anthony Cronin , a trader at Societe Generale SA in New York, one of the
21 primary dealers that trade with the U.S. central bank. “It
helped break us out of the range that we’ve been in for the last
four months or so.”  Yields on 10-year notes increased 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 2.23 percent at 11:49 a.m.  New York  time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities maturing in February 2022 fell 29/32, or $9.06 per
$1,000 face amount, to 97 30/32.  Ten-year note yields touched 2.25 percent, the highest
level since Oct. 31, after trading between 1.79 percent and 2.09
percent this year until yesterday. The security’s 200-day moving
average was 2.21 percent.  Thirty-year bond  yields climbed as much as 11 basis points
to 3.38 percent, also the most in more than four months. The
200-day moving average was 3.36 percent.  Yield Gap Widens  The difference in yields between and two- and 30-year
securities increased to 299 basis points, the most since
October. Two-year yields rose two basis points to 0.37 percent.  Volatility rose from the lowest level in more than four
years. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which
measures price swings based on options, increased yesterday to
73.8 basis points, up from the previous day’s 69.9 basis points,
the least since July 2007. The gauge rose as high as 117.8 on
Aug. 8. The reading means traders expect a yield range of 73.8
basis points on an annualized basis in the next month.  Valuation measures show government debt is becoming less
expensive. The term premium, a model created by economists at
the Fed, was negative 0.43 percent today, the least since
October. It touched negative 0.79 percent on Feb. 2, the most
expensive ever, and compares with the average of positive 0.56
percent over the past decade. A negative reading indicates
investors are willing to accept yields below what’s considered
fair value.  Volume Increases  Treasury market volume rose yesterday to the highest level
since Feb. 29 amid the Fed’s assessment of the economy. About
$339 billion of Treasuries changed hands through ICAP Plc, the
world’s largest interdealer broker, compared with the one-year
average of $268 billion.  “There should be higher volumes over the next couple of
days, and as we move into a new range, volume will peter down,”
said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist at the primary
dealer Credit Suisse Group AG in New York. “The two parts that
we are going to look at are today’s 30-year supply and where
coupon payments get reinvested tomorrow. That will be pretty
telling, where people put it.”  Investors should sell 10-year Treasury futures as
economic conditions “continue to gradually improve,” according
to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Futures expiring in June may fall to 126 from an entry
point of 129 17/32, Francesco Garzarelli, co-head of fixed-
income strategy in  London , wrote today in an e-mailed report.
Investors should end the trade should the securities close above
131 1/2, he said.  Quantitative Easing  Ten-year notes fell for a sixth straight day in their
longest run of declines since October on a reduced likelihood of
a third round of debt purchases by the central bank under
quantitative easing. The Fed refrained yesterday from new moves
to cut borrowing costs, saying the U.S. labor market is gaining
strength.  “QE3 doesn’t seem to be coming down the pike any time
soon,” said Larry Milstein, managing director in New York of
government and agency debt trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co., a
fixed-income broker and dealer for institutional investors.  The 10-year  break-even rate , a gauge of the outlook for
consumer prices derived from the difference between yields on
conventional and inflation-linked bonds, touched 2.39 percentage
points, a level last seen on Aug. 2.  Fed Inflation Gauge  A  measure  of traders’ inflation expectations that the Fed
uses to help guide monetary policy was at 2.5 percent, the
highest since March 1 and down from 3.23 percent in August. The
five-year, five-year forward break-even rate, which projects
annual price increases over a five-year period beginning in
2017, was below its 2.76 percent average for the past decade.  The U.S. central bank bought $1.11 billion today of
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities maturing from April 2028
to February 2042 under its program to replace holdings of
shorter-term securities with longer-term bonds. The Fed bought
$2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of quantitative easing
from December 2008 to June 2011 to spur economic growth through
lower borrowing costs.  The Treasury will auction $13 billion of 30-year debt
today, capping note and bond offerings of $66 billion this week.
The securities scheduled for sale yielded 3.355 percent in pre-
auction trading, up from 3.24 percent the last time the bonds
were sold on Feb. 9. Investors bid for 2.47 times the amount
offered last month, the least since a November sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
