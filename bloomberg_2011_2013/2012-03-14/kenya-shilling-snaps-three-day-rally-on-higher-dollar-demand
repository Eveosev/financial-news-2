Kenya ’s shilling snapped a three-
day rally, weakening the most in more than a month, on increased
dollar demand.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.3 percent to 82.40 to the dollar at 12:39 p.m. in
Nairobi.  “The shilling has weakened on increased dollar demand by
businesses as they seek to continue to accumulate dollars at
existing favorable levels,” Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at
Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  Tanzania’s shilling weakened for a third day, depreciating
as much as 0.6 percent to 1,604 to the dollar, and last traded
0.2 percent lower at 1,597.75.  Uganda ’s shilling appreciated for
the first time in three days, gaining as much as 0.5 percent to
2,454 per dollar, and trading 0.1 percent stronger at 2,465.  To contact the reporter on this story:
