Louis Dreyfus Commodities BV agreed
to buy majority control of GKE Metal Logistics Pte Ltd.,
emulating rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. that
expanded into warehousing of metals.  Louis Dreyfus will pay S$8 million ($6.3 million) for a 51
percent stake,  Van der Horst Energy Ltd. (VDHE) , GKE’s Singapore-based
owner, said yesterday in a stock-exchange filing. The unit is
approved by the London Metal Exchange to handle and store
copper, aluminum, nickel, zinc, lead and tin in its five
Singapore warehouses and also  offers  warehousing in  Shanghai .  Banks and commodities traders are taking interests in
warehousing companies to reduce the cost of storing metal.
Goldman Sachs bought  Metro International Trade Services LLC  in
2010, while JPMorgan Chase & Co.,  Barclays Capital  and Glencore
International Plc also have acquired ownership of companies that
operate metal-storage sites.  The LME, the world’s biggest marketplace for industrial
metals, has more than 600  approved  warehouses and compounds
worldwide in 37 locations, according to its website. At least 30
companies are authorized to store LME metals. Depots are
selected based on criteria such as access to highways and the
ability to meet minimum daily delivery rates to clients, known
as the load-out rate.  Louis Dreyfus is carrying out the transaction through LD
Commodities Metals Asia Private Ltd., according to the filing.
The raw-materials trader has origins going back to 1851, its
website shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
