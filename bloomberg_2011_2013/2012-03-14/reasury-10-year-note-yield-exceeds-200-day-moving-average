Treasury 10-note yields breached
their 200-day moving average for the first time since July,
suggesting bond prices may decline further.  The yield rose as high as 2.2454 percent in  New York ,
exceeding todayâ€™s 200-day moving average of 2.2117 percent.  Ten-year note yields rose today to the highest level in
more than four months, a day after the  Federal Reserve  raised
its assessment of the  U.S. economy  and reduced demand for the
relative safety of government debt.  Yield resistance is an area on charts where buy orders may
be clustered, making further yield increases more difficult.
Note and bond prices move in opposite direction of yield
changes.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to forecast changes in a
security, commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
