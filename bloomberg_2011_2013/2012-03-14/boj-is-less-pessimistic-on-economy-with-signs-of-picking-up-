The  Bank of Japan (8301)  signaled it is
less pessimistic about the world’s third-largest economy,
changing the language used in its monthly economic assessment.  “Japan’s economic activity has remained more or less flat,
although it has shown some signs of picking up,” the central
bank said in its economic report released in  Tokyo  today. The
assessment last month said the economy has been flat mainly
because of the global slowdown and the appreciation of the yen.  This was the first change in the language describing the
economy since January.  -- Editors: James Mayger, Gearoid Reidy  To contact the reporter on this story:
