Former Federal Reserve Chairman
 Paul Volcker  said central bank officials have the tools for
reducing record monetary stimulus without causing a disruption.  “As the economy grows, they have the capacity to reverse
in an orderly way what would otherwise be excesses,” Volcker
said today at a conference in  Washington  sponsored by The
Atlantic.  At the same time, policy makers face “the everlasting
problem” of how to “begin tightening up soon enough when the
economy is launching itself” in sustained growth, Volcker said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
