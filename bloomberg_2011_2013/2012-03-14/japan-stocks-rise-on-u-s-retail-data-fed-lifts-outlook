     March 14 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average closing at its highest level since July,
after U.S. retail sales jumped and the  Federal Reserve  raised
its assessment of the world’s biggest economy.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  rose 2.1 percent after the yen fell to
its lowest level against the dollar in almost a year, boosting
the earnings outlook for Japanese exporters.  Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc. (8306)  paced gains among banks after the Fed said
most of the largest U.S. lenders have enough capital to weather
another recession.  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  led steelmakers higher as
Credit Suisse Group AG recommended buying stocks in the sector.
 Sharp Corp. (6753)  rebounded from a 32-year low after a report the

helping boost  household income ,” said  Shane Oliver , Sydney-
based head of strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which
manages almost $100 billion. “Japan has benefited from the
perception that the yen has peaked for now.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.5 percent to 10,050.52 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo, the highest since July 26. The

today. The gauge advanced 1.8 percent yesterday in New York as

gathers strength.  Toyota, Japan’s biggest carmaker, rose 2.1 percent to 3,485

of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa signaled yesterday that
additional bond purchases aren’t off the table. The yen touched
83.32 against the dollar today, the lowest since April 15. The
currency has depreciated about 6 percent against the greenback
since the central bank on Feb. 14 surprised investors by
expanding an asset-buying program.  Yen Eases  “The BOJ could be stronger, but nevertheless, their move,
at least for the short-term, will change the direction of the
yen from one of strength to one of weakness,” AMP Capital’s
Oliver said.  Financial shares rose after the Fed yesterday said 15 of
the 19 largest U.S. banks could maintain adequate capital levels
even in a recession scenario. Mitsubishi UFJ gained 2.6 percent
