The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
fell, snapping a five-day advance, after the benchmark gauge for
U.S. equities rallied to the highest level since June 2008.  A gauge of financial shares in the  S&P 500  swung between
gains and losses following the  Federal Reserve ’s stress test
results.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and  MetLife Inc. (MET)  lost more than 3.3
percent.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and Zions Bancorporation rose at
least 4.1 percent. The  Dow Jones Transportation Average (TRAN)  fell 1.4
percent as the Fed’s better economic assessment caused investors
to reduce bets on more monetary easing.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  added 3.8
percent as Morgan Stanley raised its share-price estimate.  The S&P 500 fell 0.1 percent to 1,394.28 at 4 p.m. New York
time, after closing yesterday at  14.4 times  reported earnings,
the highest valuation level since July. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  advanced 16.42 points, or 0.1 percent, to 13,194.10. The
 Russell 2000 Index (RTY)  of small companies dropped 0.9 percent to
823.40. About 7.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, or 13 percent above the three-month average.  “It’s an issue of confidence,” Robert Zagunis, co-
portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management Inc., said in
a telephone interview from  Portland , Oregon. His firm oversees
$5.7 billion. “Little by little, things are improving. You have
symbolic announcements like the Fed stress tests. Longer-term,
the market will be higher, but there may be a scale back. The
question is -- are you in for the short term or the long term?”  Concern that stock gains have outpaced economic prospects
grew as the S&P 500 capped the best start to a year  since 1991 ,
approaching the median 2012 projection of strategists surveyed
by Bloomberg of 1,400. The benchmark measure rose amid better-
than-estimated economic data and corporate earnings.  Bank Stocks  A measure of  financial  shares in the S&P 500 added less
than 0.1 percent, after rising as much as 0.4 percent and
falling 1 percent earlier today. After the close of trading
yesterday, the Fed said 15 of 19 banks would be able to maintain
capital levels above a regulatory minimum in an “extremely
adverse” economic scenario, even while continuing to pay
dividends and repurchasing stock.  Citigroup slumped 3.4 percent to $35.21. MetLife fell 5.8
percent to $37.16. Bank of America added 4.1 percent to $8.84.
 Zions Bancorporation (ZION)  soared 11 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $21.58.  Regions Financial Corp. (RF)  jumped 6.9 percent to $6.17.  “You have the Fed putting an approval rating on a lot of
these banks saying: we’re comfortable with their financial
position,” Andrew Slimmon, managing director of global
investment solutions at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said in a
phone interview from Chicago. His firm had $1.6 trillion in
client assets at the end of 2011. “Then, you look at their
valuation and boy, these stocks are very cheap.”  Improving Profits  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  rose 1.3 percent, extending this year’s
gain to 22 percent, on expectations of stronger economic growth
and improving profits. Concern that the nation’s banks may be
damaged by  Europe ’s debt crisis helped drive down the index 25
percent in 2011, its worst annual performance since 2008.  U.S. bank shares will rally further, building on
yesterday’s gains, even as the S&P 500 looks set to retreat,
according to a technical analyst at UBS AG.  “It’s not like we’re getting super bullish, but the
breakout in financials is game-changing,” Michael Riesner said
in a telephone interview from Zurich.  Transportation (S5TRAN)  stocks dropped the most in the S&P 500 among
24 industries, falling 1.5 percent. The group is considered a
proxy for economic growth. The Fed said yesterday that strains
in global financial markets have eased and the labor market is
gathering strength, adding to speculation that it will refrain
from additional stimulus.  CSX Corp. (CSX)  slid 2.9 percent to $20.21.
 Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)  fell 2.4 percent to $107.71.  Another Round  Pacific Investment Management Co.’s Mohamed El-Erian said
the Fed’s stress tests on financial institutions were a good
sign for an economy that may still receive another round of
asset purchases from the bank.  “They were credible, and unambiguously this is good
news,” El-Erian, the chief executive officer of the world’s
largest manager of bond funds, said of the bank tests during an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu. “The big hope for everybody is that they’ll start lending
into the real economy.”  Gold producers tumbled on speculation that an economic
recovery will curb demand for the metal. Gold has surged since
December 2008 as the Fed held U.S. borrowing costs at a record
low and bought $2.3 trillion in housing and government debt
during two rounds of so-called quantitative easing.  Newmont, Freeport  Newmont Mining Corp. (NEM) , the largest U.S. gold producer,
dropped 1 percent to $54.30.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 
retreated 2.5 percent to $38.12.  Technology shares had the biggest gain among 10 groups.
Apple climbed 3.8 percent to a record $589.58, rising for a
sixth day. The world’s largest technology company had its share
price estimate raised to $720 from $515 at  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF)  rose 7.1 percent to $69.50.
The largest U.S. iron-ore producer more than doubled its
 dividend  and said it’s refocusing on the execution of expansion
projects.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, called
the “fear gauge” because it typically moves in a direction
opposite to stock prices, may stay near the five-year low it hit
yesterday, according to blogger  Bill Luby .  “I can sense that quite a few are ready to grab the
nearest pitchfork and riot about the inhumanity of the wayward
VIX,” Luby wrote in his blog yesterday, referring to those who
expect the VIX to increase. “Of course, not all bull markets
are the same and every wall of worry is made of different types
of stones, but at some point, investors need to come to terms
with the reality of a  VIX (VIX)  of 15.”  The VIX yesterday fell as much as 11 percent to 13.99, the
lowest intraday level since June 2007, and closed at 14.80. The
VIX today rose 3.5 percent to 15.31, snapping a five-day
retreat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
