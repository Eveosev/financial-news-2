The  World Bank  said a new financing
arrangement will help boost its loans to  India  by $4.3 billion
without breaching the institution’s own limits.  Under the plan approved yesterday by its board of
directors, the World Bank arm that lends to countries can issue
special bonds that India will purchase, the Washington-based
institution said in a  statement  posted on its website. That will
offset additional lending to India and keep the unit’s exposure
within a ceiling of $17.5 billion, the bank said.  “Without taking this action, it would have been difficult
for the bank to assist India meaningfully as it tackles the
remaining large challenges of lifting some 300 million out of
poverty,” World Bank Vice President for South Asia Isabel Guerrero said in today’s statement.  The  World Bank , which lends at low  interest rates  for long
durations, said it has almost 80 projects in India.  While India has been among the rapidly growing economies
that helped pull the world out of a 2009 recession, costlier
credit and the impact of  Europe ’s debt crisis on exports have
slowed its expansion. Gross domestic product rose 6.1 percent
last quarter from a year earlier, the weakest pace in more than
two years.  To contact the reporters on this story:
