Southern California home sales
jumped 8.4 percent last month from a year earlier as a record
number of investors made purchases, according to  DataQuick .  House and condominium transactions totaled 15,573 in  Los
Angeles , Riverside,  San Diego , Ventura, San Bernardino and
Orange counties, up 7.2 percent from January, the San Diego-
based data firm said today in a statement. Last month’s sales
were the highest for a February in five years.  Sales were driven up by absentee buyers -- mostly investors
-- who purchased almost 30 percent of homes sold last month, and
cash buyers, who accounted for almost 33 percent of
transactions. Both numbers were records, DataQuick said.
Shoppers continued to find bargains with foreclosed homes and
short sales, where the price is less the amount owed,  John Walsh , DataQuick’s president, said in the statement.  “The big picture remains one where the bottom of the
housing market continues to see much of the action,” Walsh
said. “Financing is still difficult for many, and lots of
potential move-up buyers and sellers are stuck because they owe
more than their homes are worth.”  Distressed properties accounted for more than half of the
region’s sales, pushing prices down 3.7 percent from February
2010 to a median $264,750. It was the 12th straight decline on a
year-over-year basis. Prices rose 1.8 percent from January,
DataQuick said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
