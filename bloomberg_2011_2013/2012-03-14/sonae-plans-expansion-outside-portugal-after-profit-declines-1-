Sonae SGPS SA (SON) , a Portuguese holding
company with interests ranging from telecommunications to
retailing, said it will expand abroad after full-year profit
declined 38 percent on lower demand in its home market and
higher borrowing costs.  Net income fell to 103 million euros ($134 million) in 2011
from 168 million euros a year earlier, Sonae said in a statement
today. Revenue dropped 1.8 percent to 5.74 billion euros, in
line with the average 5.74 billion-euro  estimate  of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net debt declined to 2.71
billion euros from 2.85 billion euros.  “2011 was strongly impacted by an important reduction in
private consumption in Iberia and a Portuguese banking system
under pressure,” the Maia, Portugal-based company said. “To
face this we were forced to turn our attention more towards
protecting profitability and debt reduction.”  Sonae plans to expand abroad to counter a deepening
recession in  Portugal  as austerity measures aimed at complying
with a 78 billion-euro bailout package from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund  continue to weigh on private
consumption this year.  The company’s  shares  climbed 1.1 percent to 0.46 euros as
of 9:14 a.m. in Lisbon.  “Sonae will continue to pursue its strategic medium- to
long-term objectives” including international growth, the
company said.  Sonae announced last year that it would expand its retail
operations to the former Portuguese African colony of  Angola 
through a joint venture with local company Condis. It plans to
open its first retail unit in Angola during 2013, it said.  The company’s board will propose a dividend of 3.31 euro
cents a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
