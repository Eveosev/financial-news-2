Perseus Mining Ltd. (PRU) , an Australian
gold producer with operations in  Ghana  and  Ivory Coast , said
it’s in talks to expand in West Africa in a bid to boost output
by about half in 2014.  Perseus, based in Perth, is in discussions with companies
about buying a mine or setting up a venture to add at least
150,000 ounces of capacity a year, Managing Director Mark Calderwood told reporters after a presentation to investors in
 Melbourne  today. He didn’t provide additional information.  “There are joint-venture discussions at the moment as
there are a few companies around that don’t have the rigs or the
cash to drill out their own projects,” Calderwood said. “We
aim to look for something to add on for 2014.”  Gold producers are buying mines and expanding operations as
prices climbed 19 percent in  London  in the past year. Calderwood
said he expects gold to trade in the range of $1,600 to $2,000
an ounce over the “next few years” and that would sustain
profit margins at low-cost producers such as Perseus.  The company is targeting output of 280,000 ounces of gold
in 2013 from 225,000 ounces this year, mainly from its Edikan
mine in Ghana.  Perseus fell 3.5 percent to A$2.52 in Sydney. The stock, up
5 percent this year, is among smaller Australian miners that
Citigroup Inc. said are likely to outperform their larger rivals
in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
