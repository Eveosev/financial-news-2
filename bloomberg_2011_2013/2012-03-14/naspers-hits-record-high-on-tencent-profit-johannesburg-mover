Naspers Ltd. (NPN)  advanced to a record
after profit at  Tencent Holdings Ltd., (700)   China ’s biggest Internet
company by revenue in which Naspers owns a 35 percent stake,
rose 15 percent.  Share of Naspers,  Africa ’s largest media group, jumped 2.8
percent to 418.50 rand in Johannesburg at the close, the highest
level since the company’s 1994 listing.  Fourth-quarter net income climbed to 2.54 billion yuan
($401 million), Tencent said in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange today. That was in line with the 2.55 billion-
yuan average of nine analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales rose 43 percent to 7.92 billion yuan.  “Tencent is by far the biggest swing factor in Naspers and
there have been big volumes today,” Wayne McCurrie, a portfolio
manager at Momentum Asset Management, said by phone from
Johannesburg.  Naspers earns  46 percent of sales  from its pay television
business and 16 percent from its investment in Tencent. Its
stake in Tencent is valued at $17 billion, 76 percent of its
market value of 170 billion rand ($22.4 billion) based on
today’s share price.  “When you buy Naspers you are buying two things: a very
stable, good cash-flow-generative pay television business and
then you are buying a range of Internet-linked businesses that
have still got to convert their users to cash,” McCurrie said.
“We believe they can convert them so we own the share.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
