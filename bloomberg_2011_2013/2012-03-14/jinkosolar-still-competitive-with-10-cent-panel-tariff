JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS)  can remain
competitive with global manufacturers if the U.S. government
sets an import tariff of 10 cents a watt on solar panels
produced in China.  If the U.S. does decide to levy Chinese imports, “we are
hoping the tariff would be 10 cents a watt,” Isabelle
Christensen, director of North American operations for the
Jiangxi, China-based solar panel maker, said in an interview at
Bloomberg’s San Francisco office yesterday. “If that happens,
we would still be competitive.”  A group of U.S. manufacturers led by  SolarWorld AG (SWV) ’s U.S.
unit have asked the Commerce Department to put tariffs on
imports after it made an initial ruling that Chinese subsidies
were harming U.S. manufacturers. The department is expected to
rule on the amount of the tariff March 19.  Solar panel prices fell 51 percent last year amid a global
supply glut, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Solyndra
LLC and Evergreen Solar Inc. declared bankruptcy last year,
blaming competition from Chinese-subsidized solar companies.  If the tariff is “very high,” JinkoSolar may supply the
U.S. market from its manufacturing plant in  Canada , which has an
annual capacity of as much as 40 megawatts, Christensen said.  The company is also considering locating additional
manufacturing in  South Africa , Taiwan and Malaysia. “We are not
married to having manufacturing only in China,” she said.  JinkoSolar  fell  2.8 percent to $6.44 at the close in  New
York . The shares have declined 76 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
