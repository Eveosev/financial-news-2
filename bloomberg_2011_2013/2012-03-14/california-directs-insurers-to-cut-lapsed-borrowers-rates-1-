A  California  regulator has directed
insurers to lower their rates for clients who lapsed on their
previous residential policies amid reports of “questionable
financial integration” between the companies and lenders.  Insurance Commissioner  Dave Jones  contacted the 10-largest
providers of so-called lender-placed coverage in the state about
his demand and told them to respond by April 1, his office said
today in a  statement .  Mortgage firms hire new insurance providers to shield
against losses tied to storm damage or vandalism when borrowers
fail to pay their premiums. Borrowers complained that they had
to pay more for the forced coverage than if they obtained the
policies on their own, Jones’s office said.  The state’s review found that “loss ratios are low, which
typically points to excessive premiums and is evidence to
support complaints about the absence of arm’s length
transactions between lenders and forced-placed insurers,” Jones
said in the statement.  Assurant Inc. (AIZ) , one of the largest providers of the
coverage, reversed gains after Jones’s statement and fell 71
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $42.16 today in  New York .  The insurer has been discussing rates with California,
 Robert Byrd , a spokesman for the New York-based company, said in
an e-mailed statement.  “As a regulated insurance provider in 50 states, we
routinely work with regulatory authorities, and we look forward
to continued discussions,” Byrd said .  To contact the reporters on this story:
