New Zealand job advertisements rose
5.3 percent in February from January, ANZ National Bank Ltd.
said in an e-mailed statement. The increase was driven by an 8
percent rise in internet listings, offset by a 6.4 percent fall
in newspaper advertising, the Auckland-based lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
