Metinvest, Ukraine’s biggest
steelmaker, will get a contract to supply  Turkmenistan  with
about 300,000 tons of large-diameter pipes, Kommersant-Ukraine
reported, citing Andriy Chebanenko, who heads Metinvest’s energy
programs.  The exact size of the order will be determined this month,
the newspaper said. Metinvest’s  VAT Khartsyzsky Trubny Zavod (HRTR) 
unit has already supplied 95,000 tons of such pipes to
Turkmenistan under a previous 150,000-ton contract that will be
completed by May, Kommersant cited Chebanenko as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
