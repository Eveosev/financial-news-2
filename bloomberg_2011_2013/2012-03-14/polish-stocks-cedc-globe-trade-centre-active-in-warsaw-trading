Poland ’s  WIG20 Index (WIG20)  advanced 1.7
percent to 2,337.46 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Warsaw, gaining
for the third day.  The following are among the most active stocks on the stock
exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Central European Distribution Corp. (CDC)  , Poland’s
second-largest vodka producer, rose 5.2 percent to 15.51 zloty,
a two-week high, after its board met to consider Russian
Standard Corp.’s revised investment offer.  Globe Trade Centre SA (GTC)  , the country’s biggest
property developer by market value, gained 3.4 percent to 7.03
zloty, rising for the first time in four days as a technical
indicator suggested the stock’s decline was overdone. GTC’s 14-
day relative strength index stood at 28 at the close yesterday.
A reading below 30 indicates to some technical analysts a
security may rise.  To contact the reporter on this story:
