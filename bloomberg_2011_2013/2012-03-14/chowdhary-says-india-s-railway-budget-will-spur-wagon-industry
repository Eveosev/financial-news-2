Umesh Chowdhary, vice chairman and
managing director,  Titagarh Wagons Ltd. (TWL) , comments on the  Indian
Railways ’ budget. He made the comments in an e-mailed statement
in response to questions from Bloomberg News.  “One very positive aspect of this year’s budget is the
announcement of the logistics corporation to use and develop
railway yards as freight terminals. This would increase the
private train traffic significantly and will result in a big
positive for the wagon industry too.  ‘‘There have been some other positive announcements
including reintroduction of the wagon investment scheme and once
these are implemented, this segment of our business which has
been dormant for the last two years, will pick up significantly.  ‘‘The budget has set a very ambitious, yet achievable
target of attaining an operating ratio of 74-75 percent in two
years. If the railways needs to get close to that, the only way
is to increase freight loading significantly, which means a
substantial increase of wagon procurement. Incidentally, the
targeted annual wagon procurement stated in the vision 2020 is
29,000 wagons as against the current 16,000 to 18,000 wagons.  ‘‘I believe the tall task before the rail minister will be
to ensure timely implementation.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
