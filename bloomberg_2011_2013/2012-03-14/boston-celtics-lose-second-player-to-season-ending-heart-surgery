The  Boston Celtics  have lost two
players in as many months to season-ending heart surgery.  Chris Wilcox will have an operation March 29 at the
Cleveland Clinic to fix a long-standing aortic abnormality, the
National Basketball Association team said in an e-mailed
statement last night.  Boston forward  Jeff Green  is recovering from surgery in
January to repair an aortic aneurysm, or weakness in the artery
wall, that ended his season. The aorta carries blood from the
heart’s ventricle to all the main arteries.  “While we are saddened that Chris will not be able to play
again this season, the most important thing is his health and we
were fortunate to have access to an amazing team of specialists
to evaluate Chris’s case,” Celtics President of Basketball
Operations Danny Ainge said in the team’s statement.  Wilcox’s condition had remained stable throughout his 10-
year NBA career until a scan revealed a “significant
enlargement of his aorta,” the team said. His doctors indicated
that surgery should repair the condition and allow him to return
next season.  Wilcox, 29, signed with the Celtics as a free agent on Dec.
9 after two seasons with the  Detroit Pistons . He was drafted by
the Clippers with the eighth overall pick in the 2002 draft and
spent almost four years in  Los Angeles  before moving to the
 Seattle SuperSonics  for two years.  In 567 NBA games, Wilcox has averaged 8.6 points and 5.1
rebounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
