U.K. Coal Plc (UKC) , a mining company
based in northern England, was the biggest loser in the  FTSE
All-Share Index (ASX)  today after saying it will restructure its
business and may close the Daw Mill mine.  U.K. Coal fell 28 percent to 21.25 pence, the lowest
closing price since it began trading in London in June 1993. The
stock has lost 25 percent this year, valuing the Doncaster-based
miner at 63.6 million pounds ($99.8 million).  “The company has today commenced consultation on the
potential closure of Daw Mill by early 2014,” U.K. Coal said in
a statement. “Although U.K. Coal’s other mines are performing
broadly in line with expectations, production at Daw Mill is
around 175,000 tons behind budget.”  The company is in talks with Lloyds Banking Group Plc to
address  funding  requirements, it said.  Howard Seymour, a London-based analyst at Numis Securities
Ltd., placed his buy recommendation, made in August, under
review today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
