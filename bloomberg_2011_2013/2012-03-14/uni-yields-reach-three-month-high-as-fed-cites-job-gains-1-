Tax-exempt 10-year bond yields rose
to a three-month high as U.S. Treasury interest rates jumped
after the  Federal Reserve  said the labor market is gaining
strength.  The yield on top-rated U.S. municipals due in 10 years rose
seven basis points to  2.12 percent  at 4:02 p.m. in  New York , the
highest since Dec. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. The 30-year muni yield
climbed to  3.38 percent , the highest since mid-February. Yields
move in the opposite direction of prices.  “This is a reaction from the Treasury sell-off,” Jason Hannon, a trader at New York-based Arbor Research & Trading
Inc., said in a telephone interview. “People are willing to
concede on levels in order to get bonds traded.”  Fed policy makers raised their assessment of the economy
yesterday, saying “the  unemployment rate  has declined notably
in recent months but remains elevated.” The U.S.  jobless rate 
fell to 8.3 percent in February from 9 percent a year earlier.  Treasuries due in 10 years yielded  2.27 percent  at 4:36
p.m. in New York, the highest level since October, according to
Bloomberg Bond Traders prices.  Municipal rates aren’t rising as quickly as yields on
federal bonds, making tax-exempt debt more expensive compared
with Treasuries.  The 30-year benchmark tax-exempt yield was  99.2 percent  of
the  interest rate  on similar-maturity Treasuries, the lowest
since July and down from 137.7 percent in November, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The iShares S&P National AMT-Free Bond Fund, the biggest
exchange-traded  fund (MUB)  tracking the muni market, fell 0.93 percent
today to $108.35, the lowest since Dec. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The premium on the fund, the amount by
which its share price exceeds the value of its holdings, was
0.35 percent yesterday, the lowest since Dec. 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
