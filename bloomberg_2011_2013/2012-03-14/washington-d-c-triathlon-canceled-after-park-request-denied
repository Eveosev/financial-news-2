The  Washington  D.C. Triathlon was
canceled today after the U.S. National Park Service denied a
permit for the race.  Carol Johnson, a spokeswoman for Washington’s National Mall
and Memorial Parks, said the event would have violated a policy
not to hold any foot races in that area between the U.S.
Memorial Day and Fourth of July holidays. The Park Service had
granted an exemption for the event the past two years.  “Because of a number of things going on in the parks this
year, it was necessary to enforce the policy,” Johnson said in
a telephone interview. “It had nothing to do with who applied
for it.”  In the event, which features  sprint  (900-yard swim, 12-mile
bike ride, 3.1-mile run) and  international -distance (.9-mile
swim, 25-mile bike, 6.2-mile run) races, competitors swim in the
Potomac River, and bike and run past landmarks in downtown
Washington, including the  U.S. Capitol Building  and  Lincoln
Memorial . About 2,000 competitors had signed up for the event,
which was to have been staged for the third straight year.  Competitors were given a choice of transferring their $135
(sprint), $190 (international) or $280 (relay team)  registration 
fees to one of six other area races or requesting a full refund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
