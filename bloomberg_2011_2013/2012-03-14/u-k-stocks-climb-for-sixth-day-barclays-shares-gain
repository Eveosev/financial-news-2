U.K. stocks  fell, ending a five-day
rally, as declines in  Vodafone (VOD)  Group Plc shares and basic-
resources companies overshadowed an improved assessment of the
world’s largest economy from the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Vodafone fell 2.4 percent, the most in two months, as Exane
BNP Paribas SA downgraded the world’s biggest mobile-phone
operator.  Rio Tinto  Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  retreated with
metals prices. The FTSE 100 Index unperformed most western-
European markets today as stocks including  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
the largest index member by  weighting , traded without the right
to the latest dividend.  The FTSE 100 slid 10.48, or 0.2 percent, to 5,945.43 at the
close in London, erasing earlier gains in the final hour of
trading. The gauge has still rallied 6.7 percent this year as
the  European Central Bank  disbursed 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion) of loans to the region’s banks. The FTSE All-Share
Index fell 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s  ISEQ Index (ISEQ)  rallied
0.4 percent.  “A weaker mining sector was able to drag the FTSE lower,
as raw-material stocks also felt the impact of the almighty
dollar,” said Will Hedden, a sales trader at IG Index in
London. “Now that hopes of a more accommodative Fed are off the
table for the time being, bulls will need to look elsewhere for
real reasons to lift indices beyond their current levels.”  The dollar strengthened against the yen and the euro as the
Fed raised its outlook for U.S. growth, reducing expectations
the bank will begin a third round of bond purchases.  HSBC, Hammerson  HSBC, Hammerson Plc and Land Securities Group Plc were
among companies on the FTSE 100 that traded without the right to
their latest dividend today, taking 6.82 points off the gauge,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The number of shares changing hands on the FTSE 100 was 30
percent higher than the 30-day average, Bloomberg data show. The
gauge had earlier rallied as much as 0.6 percent, to within 11
points of the 6,000 level.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said late yesterday that
strains in global financial markets have eased and the labor
market is gathering strength. At the same time, it said that the
unemployment rate is “elevated” and “significant downside
risks” remain. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is sticking to his
plan to the keep the benchmark interest rate close to zero
through at least 2014.  In a separate statement, the Fed said 15 of America’s
largest 19 banks could maintain adequate capital levels even in
a recession scenario.  U.K. Economy  In the U.K.,  jobless claims  rose more than economists
forecast in February and the three-month unemployment rate
remained at the highest in 16 years, underscoring the weakness
in the labor market even as the economy shows some signs of
recovery.  Unemployment-benefit claims climbed by 7,200 from January
to 1.612 million, the Office for National Statistics said today.
That’s the 12th straight increase. The median forecast of 28
economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a gain of 5,000.

the highest since 1995.  Vodafone fell 2.4 percent to 166.65 pence. Exane lowered
its recommendation to underperform from neutral, meaning that

50 during the next 12 months.  Mining Companies Drop  Rio Tinto declined 1.5 percent to 3,480 pence and  BHP
Billiton  lost 2.3 percent to 2,000.5 pence. Copper, lead and tin
prices retreated in London.  Smiths Group Plc (SMIN)  slipped 1.1 percent to 1,089 pence after

Ltd. said the results were in-line with  estimates  while economic
uncertainty may put pressure on the company’s outlook.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  rose 3.9 percent to 248.8 pence as most U.S.
banks passed a Fed stress test.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)

pence, the biggest gain since October. The fourth-largest U.K.
insurer by market value boosted its dividend by 35 percent as
profit beat analysts’ estimates on growth in the U.S. and fees
for investment-management products.  Resolution Ltd. (RSL) , the financial-services buyout firm that
has acquired three life insurers since it was founded in 2008 by
 Clive Cowdery , soared 5.2 percent to 283.2 pence. That was the
biggest gain in five months.  Yule Catto & Co. jumped 9 percent to 228.9 pence after the
