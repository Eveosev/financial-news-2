Peruvian dollar bonds fell, pushing
up yields the most in seven weeks, after the  Federal Reserve ’s
improved assessment of the  U.S. economy  curbed speculation it
will begin a third round of bond buying.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 climbed six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 4.69 percent at 1:07 p.m. in  Lima .
That’s the steepest rise since Jan. 24. The bond’s price fell
1.07 cent to 127.18 cents per dollar.  U.S. Treasuries dropped after the Fed said yesterday
strains in global financial markets have eased while the
domestic labor market has improved, and refrained from new
actions to lower borrowing costs. The central bank purchased
$2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing from December 2008 until June 2011.  Peruvian bonds are reflecting “the downward shift in
Treasuries and the upward shift in the U.S. yield curve,” said
Bret Rosen, a Latin America debt strategist at Standard
Chartered Bank in  New York . “Peruvian sol and dollar bonds have
shifted accordingly.”  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose two basis points to 5.41
percent, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
security’s price fell 0.16 centimo to 116.18 centimos per sol.  The sol was unchanged at 2.67 per  U.S. dollar , according to
Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
