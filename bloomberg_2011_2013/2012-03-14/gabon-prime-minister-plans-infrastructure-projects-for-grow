Gabon ’s prime minister, Raymond Ndong Sima, is planning infrastructure investments to boost the
central African nation’s economy for “sustained, inclusive and
equitable” growth.  Projects include construction of hospitals, a network of
urban roads, and the extension of the electricity grid beyond
the country’s main cities, he told reporters in Libreville, the
capital, today.  Ndong Sima, 57, was appointed by President Ali-Ben Bongo Ondimba on Feb. 28 following a parliamentary election in
December when the ruling Parti Democratique Gabonais won 108 of
120 seats.  Growth in Gabon, central  Africa ’s third-biggest oil
producer, is projected to slow to 3.3 percent this year from 5.6
percent in 2011, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  An economic recovery needs effective tax systems, better
access for the poor to financial services and promotion of
private sector development and investment, Ndong Sima said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
