The German economy had a better-
than-expected start to 2012 as risks from the euro region’s debt
crisis eased, the Halle-based IWH economic institute and Kiel
Economics said in a joint economic outlook.  The German economy,  Europe ’s biggest, will expand 1.3
percent this year and 2.2 percent in 2013, the two institutes
said in a joint forecast. The  unemployment rate  will drop to 6.4
percent in 2012 and reach 6.1 percent next year, the institutes
said. Germany’s budget will return to surplus in 2013, they
said.  Germany’s benchmark  DAX share index  is up about 20 percent
this year, outperforming its main European counterparts as
investors bet on a return to growth after a contraction in the
fourth quarter of 2011. Investor confidence rose to a 21-month
high in March after the  European Central Bank  flooded financial
markets with cash.  To contact the reporter on this story:
