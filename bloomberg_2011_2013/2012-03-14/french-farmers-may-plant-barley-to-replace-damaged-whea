French farmers whose wheat fields
were damaged by freezing weather last month may replant spring
barley, according to Remi Haquin, president of the cereals
council at crop office FranceAgriMer.  The regions in  France  that suffered from winterkill in
wheat are not necessarily those suitable for corn, for example
in the case of Lorraine, Haquin said today at a press conference
in Montreuil-sous-Bois outside Paris.  Temperatures in the Alsace and Lorraine regions fell below
minus 15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) in February,
after mild January weather had boosted crop development. It’s
too early to assess the extent of damage to wheat, Haquin said.  “There is damage, there will be plowing over, that’s for
sure,” Haquin said. “What we can’t say today is how much is
affected and what effect it will have on production in July.”  Lorraine on average produced 4.8 percent of French soft
wheat in the past five years, while Alsace accounted for about 1
percent of the crop, FranceAgriMer data show.  “We don’t have a year to compare because we haven’t had
such damage so late in the season at such an advanced state of
vegetal development,” he said. “Where it froze is not
necessarily where you can plant corn. In Lorraine, what is
plowed over will rather be planted with barley.”  Haquin sowed 160 hectares (395 acres) of winter wheat for
this year’s harvest on his 350-hectare farm north of Paris, and
while some fields look “a little ragged,” no wheat needs to be
plowed, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
