The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment dropped in the Asia-Pacific
region, according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 5 basis points to 147 basis points
as of 8:27 a.m. in  Singapore , Barclays Plc prices show. The
gauge is poised to close at its lowest level since Sept. 1,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index declined 5 basis points
to 137 as of 11:26 p.m. in Sydney, Barclays prices show. The
measure is set for its lowest close since Aug. 5, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 3 basis points to 137
basis points as of 9:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The measure is set for its lowest close since Aug. 18,
according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
