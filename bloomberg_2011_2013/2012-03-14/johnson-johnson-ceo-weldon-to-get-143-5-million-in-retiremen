Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s departing Chief
Executive Officer William C. Weldon will receive $143.5 million
in retirement pay, the world’s second-biggest seller of health
products said today in a regulatory filing.  Alex Gorsky  is scheduled to take the helm of  New Brunswick ,
New Jersey-based J&J on April 26, making him the ninth leader in
the company’s 126-year history. Weldon, 63, who will remain
chairman, amassed $95.1 million in deferred and long-term
compensation during his 40 years with the company, where he
started as a sales representative in 1971.  Weldon’s pension has a present value of $48.4 million,
which he will receive in monthly payments after he retires, the
company said in the filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. His total compensation fell to $26.8 million in 2011
from $28.7 million a year earlier, the second consecutive annual
decline, as the company struggled with recalls of artificial hip
implants and over-the-counter drugs, and safety concerns
involving vaginal mesh products.  Gorsky, who heads the devices and supply-chain units, beat
out Sheri S. McCoy, the leader of the company’s branded-drug
units, for the top spot. Gorsky was paid $6.8 million in total
compensation in 2011 while McCoy received $8.7 million,
according to the company’s filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
