U.S. bank shares will rally
further, building on yesterday’s gains, even as the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index looks set to retreat from a 3 1/2-year high,
according to a technical analyst at UBS AG.  “It’s not like we’re getting super bullish, but the
breakout in financials is game-changing,” Michael Riesner said
in a telephone interview from Zurich. “There is a significant
shift in the sector landscape.”  A  gauge of lenders  jumped 3.9 percent yesterday, capping a
18 percent advance so far in 2012, before the  Federal Reserve 
said most banks passed its stress tests. Riesner said he expects
financial shares to gather strength, while stocks sensitive to
the economy become weaker.  “We wouldn’t chase the market here, only financials into a
pullback,” Riesner said. “We’re cautious and don’t see a
change in the medium term.”  The  S&P 500  climbed 1.8 percent yesterday to 1,395.95, its
highest since June 2008, as JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of
America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group each jumped more than 6
percent. The benchmark index may this week reach 1,401, its next
resistance level, Riesner said.  This will be followed next week by the formation of tops in
the S&P 500’s price chart, marked by a series of rallies,
pullbacks and lower lows, Riesner said, adding he remains
“cautious” over the outlook for the next eight to 12 weeks.  A setback of 5 percent to 10 percent for the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  is
likely in the second quarter, Riesner said.  In November, Riesner said the S&P 500 would rally, having
entered a “tactical bull mode” from a short-term cycle low.
The gauge has gained 12 percent since then.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
