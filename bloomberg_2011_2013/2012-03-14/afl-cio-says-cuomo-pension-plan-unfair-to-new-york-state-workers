The AFL-CIO, the largest U.S. labor
group, said it “strongly condemns” New York Governor  Andrew Cuomo ’s plan to raise the retirement age for public workers and
offer a 401(k)-type option, saying employees will be hurt.  “Instead of cutting pensions for workers, we should focus
on ensuring that corporations and the wealthiest  New Yorkers  are
paying their fair share of taxes,” the labor group said today
in a statement at its executive council meeting in Orlando,
Florida.  The state Assembly, controlled by Democrats, approved on
March 12 a budget that excludes Cuomo’s pension plan. The
Republican-controlled Senate also adopted a budget, and leaders
in both houses are seeking agreement on a spending plan before
March 31.  Moving to a 401(k) type of retirement account from a state-
backed pension would turn over billions of dollars to Wall
Street firms whose actions caused “damage” to the financial
market starting in 2008, the AFL-CIO said.  Cuomo, a Democrat, has said his pension overhaul would save
local governments and the state $113 billion over the next 30
years as it raises the  retirement age  to 65 from 62 for most new
public workers.  The proposal has angered the state’s public-worker unions
and Comptroller  Thomas DiNapoli , a fellow Democrat and the sole
trustee of the $140.3 billion pension fund.
