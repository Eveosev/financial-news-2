Ethanol futures snapped a three-day
streak of gains after an Energy Department report showed an
increase in the amount of days of supply.  Futures sank after the government said stockpiles were
little changed at 22.04 million barrels the week ended March 9,
compared with 22.07 the prior week. That’s equal to 24.7 days of
supply, up from 24.3.  “Everyone’s still talking about the stockpiles,” said
Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in
 Chicago . “Even though they fell a little bit today, people want
to focus on the glut here.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 0.7 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.304 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
first decline since March 8. Prices have gained 4.6 percent this
year.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.285 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.345, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  increased 3.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to
$2.355 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel dropped 2.5
cents, or 1 percent, to $2.41.  The renewable fuel is blended with gasoline to stretch
supply and meet federal mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
