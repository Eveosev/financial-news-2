Units of  PT Berlian Laju Tanker (BLTA) ,
Indonesiaâ€™s largest shipping company by market value, sought
protection from creditors in the U.S.  Units including Chembulk New York Pte Ltd. filed today in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for protection under Chapter
15 of the  bankruptcy code , which puts on hold claims while a
company reorganizes outside the U.S.  Berlian Laju, based in Jakarta, yesterday said it won an
order in the Singapore High Court preventing its ships from
being impounded while it restructures.  The debt incurred by the various companies within the
Berlian Laju group is about $2.4 billion, according to a March
12 court filing in Singapore by Mark Chadwick, who is advising
the shipping company on its restructuring plan.  Berlian ceased payment of loans, bonds and finance leases
of about $418 million maturing this year as lower freight rates
and higher fuel costs undermined its financials, the company
said on Jan. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
