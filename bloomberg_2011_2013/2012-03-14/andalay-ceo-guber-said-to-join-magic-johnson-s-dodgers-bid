Peter Guber , chief executive
officer of Mandalay Entertainment Group and co-owner of
basketball’s Golden State Warriors, joined Magic Johnson’s
contingent trying to buy Major League Baseball’s Los Angeles
Dodgers, a person with knowledge of the situation said.  Guber, 70, would be an investor in the group that also
includes  Mark Walter , chief executive of Guggenheim Partners
LLC, and Stan Kasten, a veteran baseball executive who would run
the team if the bid is successful.  Mandalay makes movies, television shows and owns minor-
league baseball teams, including the Dayton Dragons, who count
Johnson, a Basketball Hall of Fame member, as an investor.  The person was granted anonymity because no one is
authorized to discuss the ownership group publicly. Guber
declined to comment, Warriors spokesman Raymond Ridder said
yesterday in an e-mail.  Johnson’s group is one of at least four that probably will
be submitted to  Major League Baseball  owners for approval next
week to continue the bidding process. SAC Capital’s  Steve Cohen 
is another bidder.  Dodgers owner  Frank McCourt  has agreed to select a winning
bid by April 1. A sale is scheduled to be completed by April 30.  Guber and Joe Lacob, managing partner at the San Francisco
Bay area-based venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &
Byers, paid a record $450 million for the Warriors in 2010.  Guber joining the group was first reported by the Los
Angeles Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
