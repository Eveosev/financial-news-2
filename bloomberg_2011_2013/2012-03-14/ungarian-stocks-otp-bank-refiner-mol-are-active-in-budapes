Hungary’s benchmark  BUX (BUX)  stock index
rose for a fifth day, advancing to the highest in more than a
month, climbing 1.3 percent to 19,378 by the end of trading in
Budapest.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Hungarian market today, which will be closed for a two-day state
holiday starting tomorrow. Stock symbols follow company names.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, climbed
as much as 2.8 percent to 4,039 forint after the Federal Reserve
bolstered confidence in the U.S. banking system and raised its
economic assessment, boosting demand for risker assets
worldwide. The shares closed 0.5 percent lower at 3,912 forint.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL HB),  Hungary ’s largest oil refiner, climbed
2.8 percent to 19,950 forint, its sixth day of gains. Wood & Co.
raised its price estimate for the stock today to 23,300 forint
from 22,950 forint, saying the current price does not fully
reflect the value of Mol’s new oil wells in Iraq.  To contact the reporter on this story:
