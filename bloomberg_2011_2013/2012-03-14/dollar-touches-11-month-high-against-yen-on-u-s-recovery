The dollar reached an 11-month high
against the yen before U.S. data forecast to show regional
manufacturing expanded and initial jobless claims decreased,
adding to signs the American economy is gathering momentum.  The greenback was near the highest level in four weeks
against the euro amid reduced bets the  Federal Reserve  will
begin a third round of bond purchases, or quantitative easing,
which could debase the world’s reserve currency. The yen slid
against most major counterparts as Asian stocks rose for a third
day, curbing demand for the lower-yielding Japanese currency.  “We’re seeing a shift in trend to dollar buying across the
board,” said Junichi Ishikawa, an analyst in Tokyo at IG
Markets Securities Ltd. “Should U.S. economic data continue to
come in firm, it will support the market’s view that the Fed
doesn’t need QE3.”  The dollar touched 84.18 yen, the highest level since April
13, before trading little changed at 83.78 yen at 8:51 a.m. in
 London . The U.S. currency was at $1.3043 per euro from $1.3032
yesterday. It earlier reached $1.3004, the strongest since Feb.
16. The yen slid 0.2 percent to 109.29 per euro.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s general economic
index probably slid to 17.5 this month from 19.5 in February,
according to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. Readings greater than zero signal expansion in the
so-called Empire State Index, which covers New York, northern
 New Jersey  and southern  Connecticut . A gauge of manufacturing in
the Philadelphia region may increase to 12 in March, another
poll indicated. That would be the highest since April. Both Fed
reports are due today.  The Labor Department may say today the number of initial
applications by Americans for jobless benefits fell by 5,000 to
357,000 in the week ended March 10, according to economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
