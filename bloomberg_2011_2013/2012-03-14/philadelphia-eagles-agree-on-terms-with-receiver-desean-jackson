The  Philadelphia Eagles  and
receiver DeSean Jackson agreed on a five-year contract extension
that runs through the 2016 National Football League season.  Jackson, 25, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, has 229
receptions for 4,085 yards and 21 touchdowns in four years with
Philadelphia, the team said today in a news release. He also has
three rushing touchdowns and a team-record four punt return
scores.  “We are thrilled to be able to keep one of the NFL’s top
playmakers in Philadelphia,” coach  Andy Reid  said in the
release. “DeSean is a game breaker, he has the speed and
ability to score from anywhere on the field and he has proven
himself to be a big threat for our offense.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
