Bouygues SA (EN) ,  France ’s second-
largest builder, lost a defamation suit against a French weekly
for writing that the company’s contract to build a new
headquarters for the  Defense Ministry  was under investigation.  A Paris court found that while five of the seven passages
from the report were defamatory, Canard Enchaine’s director
Michel Gaillard had acted “in good faith” in running the
story.  Bouygues denied the satirical news weekly’s report that
French police are investigating allegations of corruption and
favoritism in awarding the Paris-based builder the contract. A
Bouygues-led group won the contract in May to build a “French
Pentagon,” a 3.5 billion-euro ($4.6 billion) project to bring
Defense Ministry civil servants and the armed forces together in
one building by 2016 in southern Paris.  Bouygues welcomes the court’s acknowledgement of the
defamatory nature of most of the report and that the paper
didn’t show proof an investigation against the company has been
opened, said a Bouygues spokesman who couldn’t be cited by name
in line with company policy.  Bouygues’s share of the contract is valued at 1.2 billion
euros, including 534 million euros of maintenance contracts over
the 27-year period, the company said in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
