Ramesh Maheshwari, executive vice
chairman at  Texmaco Rail & Engineering Ltd. (TXMRE) , comments on the
Indian Railways’ annual budget unveiled today. He answered
questions via e-mail.  “The budgeted expenditure for procurement of rolling stock
makes a significant increase and augurs well for the fortunes of
the rolling-stock manufacturers. The revival of the procurement
plan for high-power electric and diesel locomotives needs to be
on fast track to make up for lost time.  ‘‘Texmaco Rail would be a significant beneficiary as the
company has already moved ahead in design development of high
axle load freight cars and modern double-deck container flat
wagons and auto cars. The company has also emerged as a reliable
supplier of locomotive shells to the Ministry of Railways.  ‘‘The reduction in operating ratio to 85 percent from 95
percent is well targeted, but it would need major administrative
overhaul and rigorous financial discipline.  ‘‘The decongestion in the rail network, which has been
accorded high priority, is necessary to sustain planned GDP
growth and also augment railways revenue. Currently, 80 percent
of traffic is carried on the quadrilaterals and diagonals and
there is little scope for running additional trains.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
