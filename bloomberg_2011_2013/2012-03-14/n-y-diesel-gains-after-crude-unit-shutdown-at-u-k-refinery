Diesel in  New York  Harbor
strengthened after Ineos Group AG shut a crude unit at its
Grangemouth refinery in the U.K.  The 65,000-barrel-a-day crude distillation unit was closed
March 12, according to Abudi Zein, a senior vice president at
Genscape Inc., an energy monitoring firm based in Boston.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in  New York Harbor (DIESNULP) 
rose 0.38 cent to 6.38 cents a gallon versus futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:16 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 0.82 cent to
$3.3394 a gallon.  Inventories of the fuel on the East Coast dropped 1.3
million barrels to 21.5 million last week, according to the
Energy Department.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane  gasoline  at the
New York hub held at 23.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
