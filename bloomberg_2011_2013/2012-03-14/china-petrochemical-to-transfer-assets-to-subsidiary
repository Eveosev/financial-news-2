China Petrochemical Corp., the
nation’s second-largest oil and natural-gas producer, will
eventually transfer its overseas assets to  China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. (600028)  to avoid competing with the subsidiary.  China Petrochemical, known as Sinopec Group, will also sell
all remaining chemical businesses within the next five years,
according to a filing by the Beijing-based unit to the  Hong Kong 
stock exchange today.  The parent company has spent at least $18.1 billion on six
Canadian purchases, including the $8.83 billion acquisition of
Addax Petroleum in 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The statement gave no time frame for when the foreign
assets would be transferred.  The companies signed an agreement not to compete before the
unit began public trading in Hong Kong in 2000.  China National Petroleum Corp. is the nation’s largest oil
and gas producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
