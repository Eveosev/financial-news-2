The euro may strengthen to 112.80
yen by May, its highest level in more than seven months,
according to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., citing trading
patterns.  The 17-nation euro bottomed against the yen in January,
according to Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at the unit of
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) ,  Japan ’s second-largest
bank by market value. “The euro-yen is in the middle of the
fifth wave of the multi-month upward cycle,” which is projected
to end around April, Uno said, referring to Elliott Wave Theory
which says market swings follow a predictable five-stage
structure.  The euro traded at 108.62 yen as of 11:35 a.m. in Tokyo
from 108.53 yesterday in  New York , after having risen more than
11 percent over the past two months.  The euro on Jan. 16 touched 97.04 yen, the lowest since
December 2000, and rallied to 102.21 on Jan. 26, the first wave
in the Elliott cycle, according to Uno. The common currency’s
retracement to 99.25 yen on Feb. 1 was in the second wave of the
cycle and its rebound to 109.93 yen on Jan. 27, the third wave,
he said. The fourth wave was completed on March 6 when the euro
dropped to 105.65 yen.  The  Elliott Wave Principle , proposed by accountant Ralph
Elliott in the 1930’s, is a form of technical analysis based on
the theory that investor psychology moves between optimism and
pessimism in natural sequences. It seeks to predict prices by
dividing past trends into five sections, or waves.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
