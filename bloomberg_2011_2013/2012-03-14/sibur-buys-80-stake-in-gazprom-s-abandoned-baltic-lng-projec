ZAO Sibur Holding, eastern  Europe ’s
biggest petrochemicals producer, bought an 80 percent stake in
OAO Gazprom’s abandoned Baltic LNG project in the Gulf of
Finland.  The site may be used for production facilities, Rashid
Nureev, a spokesman for Moscow-based Sibur, said today by
telephone, without disclosing transaction terms.  Gazprom, the biggest natural-gas producer, dropped the
Baltic LNG project in 2008 as it switched focus to the Arctic
Shtokman field, where the company and its partners plan to make
an  investment decision  by the end of March. Liquefied natural
gas is gas that’s chilled to a liquid for transport by ship.  The sale to Sibur was reported today by Gazprom’s corporate
magazine, which cited the project’s director-general, Alexander
Krasnenkov. Sibur is in talks with shipper OAO Sovcomflot to buy
the remaining 20 percent of Baltic LNG, Krasnenkov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
