The European Union is seeking to
ban imports of products including petroleum oils and natural gas
from  Iran  and to bar global bank-transfer messaging companies
from providing services to entities subject to EU sanctions.  The EU regulatory arm and the bloc’s foreign affairs
service proposed that as well as more common fuels such as
gasoline and diesel, the list of banned products include oils
obtained from bituminous materials other than crude, liquefied
petroleum gas as well as bitumen and asphalt, according to a
draft regulation obtained by Bloomberg. The document details
what is included in the EU’s oil embargo on Iran, which enters
into full force on July 1 when a grace period on existing
contracts ends.  The EU is also seeking to prohibit the supply of
“financial communication services” to individuals and
businesses whose assets and resources the bloc decided to
freeze, according to the draft measure, which is being
considered by EU national governments.  That clarifies that Swift will have to impose sanctions
against Iranian financial institutions. The Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication said last month
it is prepared to discontinue services once the EU presents
implementing rules on restrictions adopted by the bloc’s 27
nations on Jan. 23.  The EU draft regulation offers some exemptions from the
asset freeze, including the possibility of releasing certain
funds for diplomatic missions or making available of certain
funds to the Central Bank of Iran for the execution of existing
contracts, which are allowed to continue until July 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
