Cigna Corp. (CI) , the U.S. health
insurer that operates in 30 countries, is buying corporate bonds
and selling some municipal debt, Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said.  “The high-quality corporates are enabling a pretty nice
yield outcome versus what some of the risk-return tradeoffs are
perceived to be in some of the munis,” Cordani said today in an
interview at Bloomberg LP’s New York headquarters.  Cigna’s investment in state and municipal bonds fell to
$2.46 billion at the end of last year from $2.52 billion at the
end of 2009, according to company  filings . Over the same period,
corporate bonds excluding public utilities rose to $10.4 billion
from $8.5 billion.  Investment-grade corporate bonds in the U.S. have gained
2.5 percent this year compared with 1.2 percent during the same
period in 2011, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data tracking price and interest income. Similarly rated
municipals have returned 2.4 percent so far in 2012, the data
show.  Funds that buy investment-grade corporate debt this year
have reported net additions of $16.8 billion through March 7,
more than half of the $30.3 billion recorded in all of 2011,
according to research firm EPFR Global.  Meanwhile, investors added about $1.2 billion to U.S.
municipal-bond mutual funds in the week through March 7, the
biggest addition in more than two years and the 14th straight
week that funds added assets, Lipper US Fund Flows data show.  Shift From Stocks  “There’s also a bit of a shift from equities” to fixed-
income assets, Cordani said. Cigna had $16.4 billion of fixed-
income investments at the end of 2011, compared with $13.9
billion in 2009, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Investor demand has pushed down spreads between global
company bonds and comparable government debt by 58 basis points,
or 0.58 percentage point, in the first two months of the year to
209 basis points, according to the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Global Broad Market Corporate Index. That’s the biggest decline
to start a year since the index began in 1996.  To contact the reporters on this story:
