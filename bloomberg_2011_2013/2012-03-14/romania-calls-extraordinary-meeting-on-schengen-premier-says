(Corrects first paragraph to reflect meeting is to discuss
extremist politics.)  Romania  wants an extraordinary
meeting of European Union chiefs to discuss growing “anti-
European” politics after the Netherlands opposed its accession
to the visa-free area, known as Schengen.  Prime Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu will discuss the
issue when he meets EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  and European
Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso today.  The Netherlands opposed the entry of Romania and  Bulgaria 
into Schengen, citing a high level of corruption at their
borders, even though the commission ruled they have met all
technical criteria to join. The two Balkan countries, the newest
and the poorest of the 27-nation EU, are looking to Schengen,
which enables free travel within borders of the zone’s members,
to further integrate into European norms.  “We ask for fair treatment because such extremist behavior
puts the integration process on hold,” Ungureanu told reporters
in Bucharest yesterday. “I think we need an extraordinary
European Council to discuss very honestly what’s going on, how
we can react to support pro-European policies.”  Ungureanu said the government is analyzing the possibility
of adopting a law regarding shale-gas exploitation as the
country lacks sufficient regulations.  Chevron Corp. (CVX) , which has exploration licenses to explore
three blocks in Romania to search for unconventional oil and gas
reserves, said yesterday it plans to begin shale-gas drilling in
Romania later this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
