Colombia ’s peso fell after the
 Federal Reserve ’s improved assessment of the U.S. economy
reduced speculation it will begin a third round of bond buying
that would further depreciate the dollar.  The peso fell 0.3 percent to 1764 per  U.S. dollar  today in
Bogota, from 1758.15 yesterday. The currency has jumped 9.9
percent this year, the best performance among 25 emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Most emerging-market currencies weakened after the  Federal
Open Market Committee  said yesterday it expects “moderate
economic growth” and predicted the U.S. unemployment rate
“will decline gradually.” The comments reduced speculation the
central bank will undertake so-called quantitative easing to
stimulate the world’s largest economy.  “The improved outlook for the  U.S. economy  makes the
dollar stronger compared to other currencies and it has affected
the move in Colombia’s peso today,” said Daniel Escobar, head
analyst at Global Securities brokerage in Bogota. “We’re simply
following the international trend.”  The Brazilian real declined 1.1 percent to 1.8123 per U.S.
dollar at 3:30 p.m. in Sao Paulo, while the  Mexican peso  sank
1.2 percent, the most among major Latin American currencies.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due July 2024 rose 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to
7.29 percent, according to the central bank. That’s the biggest
gain on a closing basis since Oct. 3. The price fell 0.922
centavo to 121.5150 centavos per peso.  Bond Auction  Yields on Colombian peso bonds fell at a government auction
of fixed-rate securities today.  The yield on the bonds due August 2026 fell to 7.42 percent
from 7.61 percent at the last auction on Feb. 22.  Colombia also sold bonds due October 2018 to yield 6.8
percent, down from 6.93 percent previously, and auctioned notes
due in June 2016 to yield 6.48 percent, the  Finance Ministry 
said in a statement.  Investor demand for the fixed-rate securities totaled 1.32
trillion pesos ($747 million), more than 3 times the 400 billion
pesos of debt offered, the ministry said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
