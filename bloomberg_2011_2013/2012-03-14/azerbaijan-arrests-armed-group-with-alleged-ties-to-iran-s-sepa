Azerbaijan arrested members of an
armed group it said collected intelligence about foreign
embassies and companies, including  BP Plc (BP/) , for  Iran ’s
Revolutionary Guards Corps, or Sepah.  The group received training and funding from Sepah to carry
out terrorist attacks against the embassies of Israel, the U.S.
and other western nations located in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku,
the Ministry of National Security said today in a statement.
Twenty-two members of the group, all of them Azerbaijani
nationals, have been arrested, it said.  The ministry last month uncovered a terrorist group with
alleged ties to Sepah and Lebanon’s Hezbollah, detaining
suspects who’d acquired weapons and were planning attacks
against foreign embassies and nationals in Baku, state
television channel AzTV reported Feb. 21.  It dismissed accusations that the latest arrests were part
of a government clampdown on religious activists. The banned
Islamic Party of  Azerbaijan , which the authorities say has links
to Iran, said last month that more than 20 of its members were
arrested on trumped-up charges.  To contact the reporter on this story:
