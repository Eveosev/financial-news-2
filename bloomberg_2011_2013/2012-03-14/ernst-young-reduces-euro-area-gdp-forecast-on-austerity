Ernst & Young LLP said the euro-
area economy will probably contract more this year than it
previously predicted as governments across the region reduce
budget deficits.  Gross domestic product  among the 17 countries that share
the single currency is set to shrink 0.5 percent in 2012,
compared with the 0.1 percent decline forecast in December,
Ernst & Young’s Mark Otty, based in  London , wrote in the
company’s spring forecast for the region published today.  Countries from Greece to the Netherlands are implementing
tax increases and spending cuts to help stem deficits amid the
region’s sovereign debt crisis, now in its third year. The cuts
will collectively reduce euro-area GDP by more than 1 percentage
point in both 2012 and 2013, Ernst & Young estimated.  “Whether this is self-inflicted damage or the unavoidable
precondition to sustainable recovery is the source of much
macroeconomic and political debate,” wrote Otty, who is
managing partner for  Europe , the  Middle East , India and Africa.  Both governments and companies in Europe face “the key
challenge” of finding liquidity this year, Otty said. States
will need to roll over about 1.1 trillion euros ($1.4 trillion)
of debt in 2012, while companies seek to refinance 1.4 trillion
euros, Ernst & Young estimated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
