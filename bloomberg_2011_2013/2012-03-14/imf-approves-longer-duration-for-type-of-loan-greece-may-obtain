The  International Monetary Fund 
agreed to extend the maximum duration for the kind of loan
 Greece  may obtain tomorrow to help the country cope with a
fiscal crisis.  Under an amendment approved by the IMF board today, the so-
called extended fund facility can be approved from the start for
as many as four years, the fund said in an e-mailed statement.
Previously, such loans could be given for as many as three years
initially and lengthened to four years later on.  The lending instrument was created in 1974 for countries
that need “a prolonged period of adjustment and major policy
shifts” to solve their balance-of-payments difficulties, the
IMF said. While initially targeting developing economies, it has
been used recently for loans to  Portugal  and Ireland and is the
proposed format of a second, 28 billion-euro ($36.5 billion)
loan to Greece to be discussed by the board tomorrow.  “Approvals of extended arrangements of up to four years
would be appropriate in some cases,” the IMF said. That
includes “if a balance of payments need beyond a three-year
period exists, the necessary economic adjustment is of prolonged
nature and is envisaged from the outset to take longer than
three years, and adequate assurances exist that the member is
able and willing to implement deep structural reforms.”  IMF Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  in a March 9 press
release said that the loan to Greece will have a four-year
duration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
