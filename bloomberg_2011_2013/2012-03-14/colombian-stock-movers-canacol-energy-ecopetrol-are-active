The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  fell 0.8 percent to 15,169.35, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.4 percent to 1,740.55.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNEC)  , the Calgary-based oil
company that operates fields in Colombia, fell 0.9 percent to
1,710 pesos after earlier rising as much as 3.2 percent.
Operations at the Capella field haven’t advanced at the rate
Canacol wanted and drilling of exploration wells in the adjacent
blocks has fallen behind schedule, said analysts Maria Adelaida Velasquez and Juan David Pineros at Colombia’s largest brokerage
Interbolsa SA in a research report today.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
was unchanged at 5,300 pesos after earlier gaining as much as
2.1 percent. Ecopetrol expects to meet production targets this
year as the government tightens security after an increase in
guerrilla sabotage, Chief Executive Officer  Javier Gutierrez 
said yesterday in an interview. Gutierrez’s comments on the
company’s production contributed to Ecopetrol’s increase earlier
today, Nicolas Bernal, an analyst at brokerage Ultrabursatiles
SA, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
