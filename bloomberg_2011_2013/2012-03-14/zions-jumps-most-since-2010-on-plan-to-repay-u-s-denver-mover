Zions Bancorporation (ZION) , the Salt Lake
City-based lender, jumped the most in more than two years after
announcing plans to issue $600 million in senior debt to help
repay $1.4 billion in U.S. government bailout funds.  Zions rose 7.7 percent to $21.03 at 10:23 a.m. in New York
trading after advancing as much as 9.8 percent, the most since
January 2010. Zions said yesterday the  Federal Reserve  didn’t
object to its capital plan submitted as part of the regulator’s
stress tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
