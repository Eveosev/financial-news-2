B2W Companhia Global do Varejo  and
its parent company  Lojas Americanas SA (LAME4)  fell after Sao Paulo
state’s consumer protection agency suspended sales by the online
retailer for 72 hours after an increase in customer complaints.  B2W fell 3.6 percent to 9.63 reais, while Lojas Americanas
dropped 3 percent to 17.51 reais. The benchmark Bovespa index
slipped 0.2 percent.  “Shares are falling in part because of the agency’s
action, even if the suspension won’t have such a big impact on
the company’s revenue,” Caue Pinheiro, an analyst at brokerage
SLW Corretora, said by phone from Sao Paulo.  Procon, as the agency is known, suspended B2W sales for 72
hours starting tomorrow and fined the company 1.74 million reais
($963,000) after an increase in customer complaints, it said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Pinheiro said shares may have also been reacting to a
report by online market research firm E-bit showing B2W’s market
share fell to 25 percent in 2011 compared with 57 percent in
2007.  To contact the reporters on this story:
