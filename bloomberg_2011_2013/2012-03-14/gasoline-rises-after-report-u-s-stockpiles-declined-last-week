Gasoline declined after a
government report showed that demand for the fuel sank from a
year earlier and a stronger dollar reduced the investment appeal
of commodities.  Futures fell after the Energy Department said that gasoline
demand over the four weeks ended March 9 was 8.42 million
barrels a day, 7.2 percent below a year earlier. The dollar
widened gains over the euro and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
retreated from a four-year high.  “When dollar remained up on the day, the market started to
drift back lower and now equities are down,” said  Gene
McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut.  Gasoline for April delivery fell 0.84 cent, or 0.3 percent,
to $3.3462 a gallon at 2:21 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , after touching $3.3809 when the report was released at
10:30 a.m. in Washington.  The  S&P 500  sank 0.4 percent at 2:22 p.m. in  New York ,
after rising as much as 0.3 percent. The dollar gained 0.5
percent against the euro, curbing the appeal of commodities to
investors.  Total fuel use over the past four weeks was 5.4 percent
below a year earlier.  “Domestic demand is just terrible,” said  Sander Cohan , a
global transportation fuels analyst and principal with Energy
Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Heating oil for April delivery fell 0.77 cent to $3.2635 a
gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.6
cent to $3.811 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA, the
nation’s biggest motoring group. Prices have gained 16 percent
this year and are 7.1 percent higher than a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
