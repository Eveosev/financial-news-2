  Soco International Plc (SIA) , a U.K.
explorer in  Africa  and  Southeast Asia , said profit increased
seven-fold in 2011 as production at the Te Giac Trang field in
Vietnam rose.  Net income climbed to $88.6 million from $12.3 million a
year earlier, the company said in statement in London. Output at
TGT, which started in August, has climbed to 40,000 barrels a
day and is scheduled to reach about 55,000 barrels.  Soco, which also has projects in the Republic of Congo,
Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo, is trying to expand
exploration in areas near to where it already operates. The
company is working on several deals that should be announced
this year, Chief Executive Officer Edward Story said.  “We’re reasonably close to finding new exploration
prospects, but I can’t talk about them now,” Story said in an
interview. “At least one of them is as promising as TGT.”  Shares rose 3.7 percent in  London  to 339.9 pence as of the
market close.  Soco’s share of production at its fields was 5,437 barrels
of oil equivalent a day, more than double the level from 2010.
Revenues jumped to a record $234.2 million last year from $48.4
million in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
