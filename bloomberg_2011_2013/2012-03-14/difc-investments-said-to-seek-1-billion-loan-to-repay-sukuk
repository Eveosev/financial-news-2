DIFC Investments LLC, which owns
properties in Dubai’s tax-free financial center, started talks
with banks for a loan to help repay a $1.25 billion Islamic bond
due in June, two bankers with knowledge of the plan said.  The company plans to raise $900 million to $1 billion from
a five-year syndicated loan and will make up the rest with its
own cash, said the bankers, who declined to be identified
because the information is private. The talks are at an early
stage and no mandate has been awarded, they said.  A spokesman for DIFC Investments couldn’t be immediately
reached when contacted today. Reuters reported the story earlier
today.  Dubai government-controlled DIFC Investments owns and
operates office buildings in the Dubai International Financial
Centre, which is home to the regional offices of banks including
Standard Chartered Plc. The company reported a loss of $274.7
million in 2010 as it wrote down the value of its properties
after prices slumped in Dubai.  DIFC Investments sold the floating rate sukuk in 2007.
The company had planned to raise $1 billion from asset sales by
the end of last year to help pay debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
