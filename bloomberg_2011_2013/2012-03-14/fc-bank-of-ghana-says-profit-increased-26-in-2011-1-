HFC Bank Ghana Ltd. (HFC) , a lender in
the West African nation that focuses on mortgages, said profit
increased last year as net interest income rose 21 percent.  Net income advanced 26 percent to 10.9 million cedis ($6.3
million) in the year through December, the bank said in a
statement e-mailed by the Ghana Stock Exchange in Accra today.
Net interest income increased to 39.7 million cedis, it said.  “The bank smartly reduced interest expense,” Derrick Mensah, a research analyst at SIC Financial Services Ltd. in
Accra, said by phone today. “It gave out more loans while it
reduced investments in government securities.”  HFC’s interest expenses during the year reduced by 11
percent to 19.3 million cedis. Loans and advances to customers
grew 15 percent to 206.4 million cedis while investment in
 government securities  declined by 7.9 percent to 70 million
cedis.  The lender’s shares were unchanged at 45 pesewas by the
close in Accra.  “We should expect to see activity in the shares, now that
the bank has indicated it will hold a rights issue in order to
meet the central bank’s 60 million cedis minimum capital
requirement by December,” Mensah said.  HFC, which has a stated capital of 45 million cedis, will
ask shareholders to approve the plan at its annual meeting on
April 26, Akwete Akita,  executive director  said on March 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
