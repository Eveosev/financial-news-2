Former U.S. Treasury Secretary
 Robert Rubin  said European leaders are “behind the curve” as
they seek to stabilize the region’s economy.  “I still think that while the probability is still
somewhat greater than not that they will reach this place of
interim stability, I still think there’s a lot of risk,” Rubin
said today at a conference in Washington sponsored by The
Atlantic.  Rubin, 73, was Treasury secretary for more than four years
under President Bill Clinton and led U.S. efforts to contain the
Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s.  “The euro-zone leaders were behind the curve in dealing
with Greece,” Rubin said. “They remained behind the curve the
whole time. And they’re behind the curve right now.”  Rubin also said another round of asset purchases known as
quantitative easing would do “very little” to help the U.S.
economy. The  Federal Reserve  has engaged in two rounds of asset
purchases totaling $2.3 trillion to boost the economy.  Rubin was co-chairman of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  from 1990
to 1992. After leaving the Treasury he moved in 1999 to become
chairman of the executive committee of  Citigroup Inc. (C)  He is now
co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations and an adviser
to Centerview Partners, a New York investment banking advisory
firm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
