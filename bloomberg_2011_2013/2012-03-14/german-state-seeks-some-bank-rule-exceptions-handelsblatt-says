The German state of  Lower Saxony 
wants Federal Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  to exempt
smaller banks from new capital reserve rules that will apply
under Basel III regulations, the state’s Prime Minister David McAllister told the  Handelsblatt  newspaper in an interview.  The new rules may dampen the savings and cooperative banks’
capacity to lend to their main clients, which are mid-sized
companies, McAllister is cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
