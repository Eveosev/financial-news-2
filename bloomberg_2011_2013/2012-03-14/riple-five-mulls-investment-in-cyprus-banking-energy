Triple Five  Group, a finance and
development company, is considering investing in Cyprus, said
Nader Ghermezian, chairman of the Canadian firm.  The group, which owns  Peoples Trust , a Vancouver-based
Bank, may invest an unspecified amount in energy, tourism,
banking and government bonds, Ghermezian told reporters in
Nicosia today. Cyprus was shut out of  capital markets  in May.  With respect to banking, there “are three options for
us,” which include opening a branch of its bank on the east
Mediterranean island, opening a new bank or “to make an
arrangement with a local bank so that we can bring more
investment” to Cyprus, Ghermezian said.  The chairman of Triple Five said that the group is already
in talks with the Central Bank of Cyprus, which is in charge of
issuing banking licenses. His group may contribute to the
development of the energy industry of Cyprus, which announced in
December its first natural gas discovery.  -- Editors: Digby Lidstone, Andrea Snyder.  To contact the reporter on this story:
