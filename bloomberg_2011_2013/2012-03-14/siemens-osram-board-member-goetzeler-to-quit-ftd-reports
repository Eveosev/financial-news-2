Martin Goetzeler, a board member of
 Siemens AG (SIE) ’s lighting unit Osram AG, has handed in his
resignation a few months before the division’s planned initial
public offering, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
without saying how it obtained the information.  Goetzeler will receive 2 million euros ($2.6 million) when
he leaves and may not move to a competitor according to his
contract, the FTD cited people close to the unit as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
