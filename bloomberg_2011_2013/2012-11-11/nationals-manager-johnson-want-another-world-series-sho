Washington Nationals manager Davey Johnson signed on for one more year with a goal of winning the
2013 World Series before becoming a team consultant.  Last season, the 69-year-old manager led the club to its
first National League East title with a 98-64 record, the best
in the majors. Washington lost 3-2 in the best-of-five NL
Division Series to the St. Louis Cardinals.  In 16 Major League Baseball seasons, Johnson has amassed a
record of 1,286-995. He is also a finalist for the Manager of
the Year award presented by the Baseball Writers’ Association of
America,  “I love managing this ballclub in this town, and for that,
I owe a debt of gratitude to the Lerner Family and [general
manager] Mike Rizzo,” Johnson said in a statement. “As
everyone knows, we have some unfinished business to tend to in
’13. I have a feeling this upcoming season will be filled with
many memorable moments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
