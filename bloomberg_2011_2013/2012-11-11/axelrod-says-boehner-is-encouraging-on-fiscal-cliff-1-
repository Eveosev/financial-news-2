 David Axelrod, a senior adviser to
President  Barack Obama ’s re-election campaign, said House
Speaker John Boehner’s comments on the fiscal cliff facing the
U.S. government at the end of the year are “encouraging.”  Without new legislation, $607 billion in automatic tax
increases and spending cuts -- evenly divided between military
and domestic spending -- will take effect starting in January.
The resulting so-called fiscal cliff stems from a standoff over
policy between the political parties, with lawmakers and Obama
unable to agree on how to curb soaring U.S. debt through a mix
of tax-code changes and cuts to federal spending.  Obama and Boehner each spoke after the Nov. 6 elections on
the need to avert the policy shifts in January, with both
expressing willingness to compromise while also reiterating
their previous positions. Boehner pointed to the possibility of
closing tax loopholes to help generate more revenue, although he
rejected the idea of raising rates on the wealthy.  Boehner “said he wasn’t going to get into details about
what he would or wouldn’t accept,” Axelrod said on the CBS
“Face the Nation” program. “He didn’t want to foreclose
discussions and that was a positive sign. ” Axelrod also said
the House speaker’s “rhetoric has been encouraging.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
