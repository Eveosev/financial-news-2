Freshman quarterback Johnny Manziel
threw for two touchdowns to lead  Texas A&M University  to a 29-24
upset over top-ranked  University of Alabama  in college football.  The No. 15 Aggies, playing their initial year in the
 Southeastern Conference , handed the defending national champion
Crimson Tide their first defeat of the season yesterday at
Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama .  Manziel, who completed 24 of 31 passes for 253 yards,
directed Texas A&M to a 20-0 first quarter with a 10-yard
scoring pass to Ryan Swope. Christine Michael scored on two one-
yard runs for the Aggies (8-2, 5-2 SEC).  “We played with a chip on our shoulder,” Swope told
reporters. “We were just trying to make a statement that we
could compete with anybody in this league.”  Alabama (9-1, 6-1 SEC) fought back in the second and third
quarters with two-yard scoring runs by T.J. Yeldon and Eddie
Lacy and a 28-yard field goal by Jeremy Shelley to trail by 20-
17.  Taylor Bertolet kicked a 29-yard field goal and Manziel
connected on a 24-yard pass to Malcome Kennedy to widen the
Aggies’ lead to 29-17 midway through the fourth quarter.  A.J. McCarron hit Amari Cooper on a 54-yard pass to bring
the Crimson Tide to within 29-24. His comeback was halted on the
 Texas A&M  goal line when Deshazor Everett intercepted his
fourth-down pass with one minute, 36 seconds left in the game.  McCarron completed 21 of 34 passes for 309 yards and
recorded two interceptions.  “Two of the three national championship teams that I
coached lost a game,” Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban told
reporters. “This team still has an opportunity to win the West
and go to the SEC championship game and win a championship.
There’s still a lot for this team to play for.”  Elsewhere among the Top 10 Bowl Championship Series teams,
it was No. 2 Kansas State 23, Texas Christian 10; No. 4 Notre
Dame 21, Boston College 6; No. 5 Georgia 38, Auburn 0; No. 6
Florida 27, Louisiana-Lafayette 20; No. 7 Louisiana State 37, No.
21 Mississippi State 17; No. 8 South Carolina 38, Arkansas 20;
and Syracuse 45, No. 9 Louisville 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
