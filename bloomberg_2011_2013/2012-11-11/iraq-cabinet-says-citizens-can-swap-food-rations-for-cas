Iraqâ€™s government will allow
citizens to choose whether to receive cash handouts instead of
food rations, State Minister Ali Al-Dabbagh said.  The Cabinet has also taken steps to prevent speculation on
food prices and to ensure the safe delivery of the cash
handouts, Dabbagh, the official government spokesman, said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The decision changes a measure adopted by the government on
Nov. 7, when the Cabinet said it would cancel food rations to 6
million families and replace them with cash handouts. The
decision stirred opposition in parliament, which called for an
extraordinary session to discuss the matter tomorrow.  Everyone eligible for the program will be given 15,000
dinars ($12.88) a month, Dabbagh said on Nov. 7. The decision
was intended to end corruption obstructing the distribution of
the five food staples: flour; sugar, rice, vegetable oil and
milk for babies, he said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
