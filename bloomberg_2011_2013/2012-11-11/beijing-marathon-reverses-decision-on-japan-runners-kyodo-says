The organizers of the Beijing
Marathon reversed a decision and will let Japanese runners take
part in the event,  Kyodo News  reported today.  The reversal came after the Japan’s embassy in Beijing
asked China’s athletic association to accept Japanese entrants
in the race, Kyodo said. Kyodo reported yesterday that an
unnamed runner was told by organizers that Japanese citizens
weren’t qualified to participate.  Relations between Asia’s two largest economies have been
strained by a dispute over uninhabited East China Sea islands
both nations claim. Japanese Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda ’s
September decision to buy the islands from a private owner
prompted violent demonstrations in China.  To contact the reporters on this story:
