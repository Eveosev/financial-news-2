California Governor  Jerry Brown 
vowed to hold the line on additional tax increases as long as
the legislature constrains new spending programs after voters in
the state approved raising levies on sales and income.  “The stack of possible spending bills is killing us,”
Brown said on CNN’s “ State of the Union ” program.
“Legislative ideas are endless and we’ll have to cut at least
some of them down.”  Proposition 30, which won voter approval Nov. 6, raises the
state’s sales tax a quarter percentage point, to 7.5 percent,
and increases rates on income starting at $250,000. The
increases are designed to raise an estimated $6 billion
annually, and expire by 2018.  The referendum marks an acknowledgment by Americans that
state and  federal budget  deficits can’t be closed with spending
cuts alone, Brown said. As part of a deal to avert deep cuts to
defense and domestic programs, President  Barack Obama  has
demanded that federal income tax rates on the wealthy be allowed
to rise, a position he says was endorsed by his re-election
victory last week.  Without “balance” between spending cuts and tax increases
“you run the difficulty that the whole country breaks down for
lack of common commitment,” Brown said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
