NII Holdings Inc. (NIHD) , which sells
wireless service under the Nextel brand in  Latin America , has
the support of the Brazilian government to purchase Unicel do
Brasil Telecomunicacoes Ltda, Folha de Sao Paulo reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  The acquisition, which may cost 370 million reais ($181
million), would allow NII to compete with larger Brazilian
rivals such as Telefonica Brasil SA and  Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3) ,
the Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
