Top-ranked Novak Djokovic came back
from a set down to beat Juan Martin Del Potro and book a spot in
the championship match at the ATP World Tour Finals.  The 25-year-old Serb defeated the 24-year-old from
Argentina, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 at  London ’s O2 arena. Djokovic won the
year-end event for the top eight when it was held in Shangai in
2008.  Del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open champion, trails Djokovic 6-3
in career meetings.    Olympic and U.S. Open winner  Andy Murray , 25, and six-time
champion  Roger Federer  of Switzerland, 31, will play for a spot
in the final later today. Murray is trying to become the first
British man in the tournament’s 42-year history to play for the
trophy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
