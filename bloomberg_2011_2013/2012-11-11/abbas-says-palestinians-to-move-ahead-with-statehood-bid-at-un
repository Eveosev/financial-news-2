Palestinian Authority  President
 Mahmoud Abbas  said he will press ahead with plans to seek
statehood recognition at the  United Nations  and resist
international pressure to drop the bid or wait until after
Israeli elections on Jan. 22.  “The pressure on us is tremendous, more than you can
imagine,” Abbas said today at a memorial ceremony in the West
Bank city of Ramallah on the eighth anniversary of Palestine
Liberation Organization founder Yasser Arafat’s death. “We are
being warned not to go and have been promised by the U.S.
administration that they will have new proposals.”  Abbas failed last year to secure approval in the 15-member
Security Council for recognition of Palestinian statehood and
membership in the UN General Assembly. This year, Abbas is
seeking a lesser goal of recognition as a “non-member observer
state” in the 193-member General Assembly, where the U.S. has
no veto, as it does in the  Security Council .  Israel may halt economic cooperation, including the
transfer of tax funds collected for the Palestinian Authority,
if Abbas moves ahead with his plan at the UN, Israeli Finance
Minister Yuval Steinitz said yesterday at a public forum in
Beersheba, Israel Radio reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
