Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
dropped the most in three weeks on investor concern over U.S.
budget cuts and a decline in third-quarter sales at  Saudi Basic
Industries Corp. (SABIC)   The world’s largest petrochemicals maker by market value
known as Sabic fell to the lowest level in a week.  Al Rajhi 
Bank, the kingdom’s biggest publicly traded lender, declined for
a second day. The Tadawul All Share Index lost 0.5 percent, the
most since Oct. 22, to 6,884.29 at the close in  Riyadh . The
measure gained 2.2 percent last week. The  Bloomberg GCC 200
Index (BGCC200)  of regional stocks and Qatar’s QE Index lost 0.5 percent.  The Stoxx 600 Index dropped 1.7 percent last week and the
 MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  lost 1.4 percent on concern the U.S.
will slip back into recession if lawmakers fail to reach a
budget compromise on the so-called fiscal cliff, which refers to
about $607 billion of tax increases and federal spending cuts
set to kick in automatically in January.  Saudi Arabia  relies on
oil exports for about 90 percent of government revenue, making
it vulnerable to swings in global demand.  “Petrochemical stocks have high sensitivity to news about
the global economy,” Turki Fadaak, head of research at Albilad
Investment Co. in Riyadh, said by phone. “Any positive news has
a good impact on the companies and any negative news has the
opposite effect.”  Sabic’s sales dropped to 44.8 billion riyals ($11.9
billion), the company said in a regulatory filing today. Sabic
said on Oct. 17 third-quarter profit tumbled 23 percent as
prices for its products dropped amid slower global economic
growth. Profit has fallen in the past four quarters as the maker
of fertilizers, plastics and steel suffers from the effects of
slowing growth in developed economies.  ‘Below Expectations’  Sabic’s third-quarter sales were “a bit below
expectations, primarily due to lower petrochemical prices in the
third quarter,” Muhammad Faisal Potrik, an analyst at Riyad
Capital, said by phone. “Ethylene prices were down 5 percent
quarter on quarter, so that also had an impact.” He had
estimated third-quarter sales at around 46 billion.  Sabic shares fell 0.6 percent to 90.25 riyals, the lowest
since Nov. 5. Al Rajhi declined 0.4 percent to 69.50 riyals.  Elsewhere in the  Middle East , Dubai’s DFM General Index
lost 0.2 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s  index  slipped 0.1 percent.
Kuwait’s  gauge  gained 0.2 percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  and
 Egypt ’s EGX 30 Index were little changed.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  dropped 0.3 percent to 1,208.12
points. The yield on the nation’s 5.5 percent bonds maturing in
January 2022 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
3.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
