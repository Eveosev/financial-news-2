Myanmar authorities said at least
seven people died and 20 were injured after a magnitude 6.8
earthquake struck early today.  The temblor occurred 72 miles (116 kilometers) north of
Mandalay at a depth of 6.1 miles at 7:42 a.m. local time, the
 U.S. Geological Survey  said on its website, revising an earlier
estimate of magnitude-7.  The government sent military helicopters to areas near the
epicenter to supply medicine, food and water to 100 temporary
shelters, said Soe Aung, director general of the relief and
resettlement department. The quake was the country’s deadliest
since at least 74 people were killed in March last year when a
 6.9-magnitude  temblor struck in Shan state.  Today’s earthquake was located too far inland to generate
any destructive tsunami in the  Indian Ocean , according to the
website of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center. The temblor was
followed by three aftershocks with magnitudes of between 5.0 and
5.8, according to USGS.  At least 80 people were killed and 6,650 homes destroyed in
neighboring Yunnan and Guizhou provinces of  China  when two
magnitude 5.6 earthquakes shook the region bordering Myanmar in
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
