Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC)  fell to
the lowest level in a week after the world’s largest
petrochemical maker said third-quarter sales dropped 8 percent.  The shares declined 0.6 percent to 90.25 riyals at the
close in  Riyadh , the lowest since Nov. 5. The benchmark Tadawul
All Share Index lost 0.5 percent.  Sales dropped to 44.8 billion riyals ($11.9 billion), the
company known as Sabic said in a regulatory filing today. Sabic
said on Oct. 17 third-quarter profit tumbled 23 percent as
prices for its products dropped amid slower global economic
growth. Profit has fallen in the past four quarters as the maker
of fertilizers, plastics and steel suffers from the effects of
slowing growth in developed economies.  Sabic’s third-quarter sales were “a bit below
expectations, primarily due to lower petrochemical prices in the
third quarter,” Muhammad Faisal Potrik, an analyst at Riyad
Capital, said by phone. “Ethylene prices were down 5 percent
quarter-on-quarter, so that also had an impact.” He had
estimated third-quarter sales at around 46 billion.  Fifteen analysts have a buy rating on Sabic shares, one
recommends a hold, and none says sell, according to  data 
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
