Israel  faced fire on two fronts for
a second day as rockets from the Gaza Strip hit its south, while
a Syrian mortar shell landed in the Golan Heights on its
northern reaches, drawing a retaliatory strike.  The Israeli tank fire was aimed at the source of the mortar
launch across the Syrian frontier and scored “direct hits,”
the army said in an e-mailed statement. The army said that
“fire emanating from Syria into Israel will not be tolerated
and shall be responded to with severity.”  The attacks highlight Israel’s vulnerabilities at a time
when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vying for re-election
on Jan. 22. Netanyahu vowed to escalate military operations to
defend the country’s citizens.  “I don’t know any of your governments who could accept
such a thing,” Netanyahu told foreign ambassadors he took today
on a visit to the coastal city of Ashkelon, a target of Gaza
rocket strikes. “We will not allow our borders to be violated
or our citizens to be fired upon.”  Defense Minister Ehud Barak consulted today with senior
military commanders in Tel Aviv on the security situation in the
south. Barak raised the prospect of a new ground offensive, the
first since Israeli troops withdrew from Gaza in 2009 after a
three-week military assault that left more than 1,100
Palestinians dead.  “If we are forced to re-enter Gaza in order to strike
Hamas and restore security to Israeli residents, we won’t
hesitate,” Barak said in Tel Aviv yesterday.  According to the Israel police, at least 10 rockets were
fired from Gaza today, a marked drop from the more than 100
rockets in the past two days.  Quiet Border  Amid concern about Gaza, Israel faced the prospect that
fighting between forces loyal to Syrian Bashar al-Assad and
rebels seeking to oust him could destabilize its quietest
frontier since the 1973 Middle East war. A mortar from  Syria 
yesterday struck an army post on the Israeli-controlled side of
the Golan Heights, causing no injuries. Israeli soldiers
responded by firing a warning missile into Syria, and the
government filed a complaint with the United Nations.  Barak said Israeli’s military “has been instructed to
prevent” the Syrian conflict “from spilling over into our
territory. Additional shelling into Israel from Syria will
elicit a tougher response, exacting a higher price from Syria.  Israel’s shekel was the worst performer among 31 expanded
major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, dropping 0.5 percent to
3.9320 a dollar as of 4:56 p.m. in Tel Aviv, headed for the
lowest settlement since Sept. 13.  ‘Less Reluctant’  ‘‘There is a feeling that something is going to happen,
that things are escalating,’’ said Moshe Nir, a trader at
Mercantile Discount Bank Ltd. in Tel Aviv. ‘‘All this talk makes
people nervous. It makes foreign investors especially jittery as
they don’t see it the way we locals do. They are less reluctant
to just get out.’’  Catherine Ashton, the European Union’s foreign policy
chief, condemned the Gaza violence today and backed Egyptian
efforts to negotiate a cease-fire between Israel and Palestinian
militant groups.  ‘‘I support the mediation efforts by  Egypt  and reiterate
that there is no place for violence in the Middle East,’’ Ashton
said in an e-mailed statement.  The latest violence in the south was ignited when
Palestinian militants fired an anti-tank missile at an Israeli
patrol along the Gaza Strip border fence on Nov. 10, wounding
four soldiers, the army said in a statement. The Israeli
military responded with tank shelling and air strikes into Gaza,
including a direct hit on a rocket-launching squad, killing six
and wounding more than 30, according to Ashraf al-Qedra,
spokesman for the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza.  ‘Change Response’  ‘‘We need to change our response,’’ Vice Prime Minister
Moshe Ya’alon said on Army Radio today. ‘‘We need to change it
until Hamas says ‘enough.’’’  Barak said Israel holds the Islamic Hamas responsible for
the attacks from Gaza and the group will pay a ‘‘severe and
painful’’ price for them.  Hamas seized control of Gaza from Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud Abbas’s Fatah party in 2007, ending a
partnership government a year after winning elections.  ‘‘You can’t rule out a connection between the tensions on
the Syrian border and in Gaza,” said Jonathan Spyer, a
professor of political science at the Interdisciplinary Center
Herzliya. “The Islamic Jihad, which is setting the pace in
terms of rocket fire, is a client of  Iran  and Iran is also a
main backer of Syria.”  Spyer said he didn’t expect Netanyahu to go for a large
operation against Gaza before Israeli elections.  “If he can avoid it, he won’t want a ground incursion,”
Spyer said by phone. “It doesn’t fit into his pattern of
behavior. In contrast to his predecessors, he tries to diffuse
the tensions.”  At the same time, he added that “there is always the
danger of things spinning out of control.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
