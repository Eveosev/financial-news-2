Houston Rockets coach Kevin McHale
is taking an immediate leave of absence to deal with a family
matter, the National Basketball Association team said.  Assistant coach Kelvin Sampson won his first game last
night as he substituted for McHale, 54, who is coaching his
second season with Houston. The Rockets (3-3) defeated the
Detroit Pistons (0-7) 96-82 on their home court at Toyota
Center.  “Kevin is a devoted family man who is needed back home in
 Minnesota  at the moment,” said Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey in a statement on the team’s website. “The Rockets
organization will keep Kevin and his family in our thoughts and
prayers during this difficult time.”  Morey didn’t disclose the reason for McHale’s departure. No
date has been set for the coach’s return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
