Egypt’s borrowing costs for three
months dropped to the lowest in a year amid expectations the
government will receive $500 million in aid from Qatar and $4.8
billion in loans from the  International Monetary Fund .  The  Finance Ministry  raised 1 billion pounds ($163.7
million) in three-month treasury bills, with the average yield
falling 11 basis points to 12.3 percent, the lowest since
November 2011, according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The
ministry also sold 3.5 billion pounds in nine-month notes and
the average yield dropped 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage
point, to 12.95 percent, the data show.  Egypt’s borrowing costs have declined from record highs
after the June election of President Mohamed Mursi, who resumed
talks with the IMF for a loan to reduce the  budget deficit  and
bolster foreign-currency reserves, which plunged more than 50
percent after last year’s uprising.  The yield on  Egypt ’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April
2020 fell four basis points last week to 5.26 percent, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The pound, subject to managed
float, weakened 0.2 percent to 6.1154 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
