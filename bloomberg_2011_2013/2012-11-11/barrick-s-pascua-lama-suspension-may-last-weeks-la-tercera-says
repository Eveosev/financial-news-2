The suspension of construction work
at  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ’s Pascua Lama mine on the border of Chile
and  Argentina  may last for weeks, La Tercera reported, citing
Chilean Mining Minister Hernan de Solminihac.  Chile’s National Geology and Mining Service ordered a halt
to work in two parts of the Andean site Oct. 31 because the
concentration of fine particles in the air exceeded safety
limits, the Santiago-based newspaper said today. Barrick had
been stripping the surface above the mining area.  Work can continue in other parts of the mine, de Solminihac
said. Barrick yesterday said it had already stopped work in the
affected areas on Oct. 27, before the agency’s decision,
according to La Tercera.  To contact the reporter on this story:
