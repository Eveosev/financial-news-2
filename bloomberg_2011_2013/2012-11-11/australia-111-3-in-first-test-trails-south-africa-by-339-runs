Ed Cowan  and Michael Clarke helped
Australia recover to 111-3 in its first innings at stumps on day
three of the rain-affected first Test against South Africa in
Brisbane, trailing the visitors by 339 runs.  Australia was 40-3 after David Warner and debut-making Rob
Quiney were dismissed without reaching double figures and Ricky Ponting failed to score. Cowan is on 49 and captain Michael
Clarke 34.  South Africa, the No. 1 team in the International Cricket
Council’s Test rankings, earlier made 450 as Hashim Amla and
Jacques Kallis completed centuries.  Amla scored 104 and Kallis 147. JP Duminy was unable to bat
after rupturing a tendon in the warm-up on day one.  Yesterday’s play at the Gabba was washed out. Australia is
unbeaten at the stadium in Test matches since 1988.  To contact the reporter on this story:
