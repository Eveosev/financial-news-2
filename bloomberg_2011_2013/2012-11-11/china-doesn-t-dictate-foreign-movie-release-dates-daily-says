China  doesn’t dictate the release
dates for foreign movies, the  China Daily  reported today, citing
Tian Jin, deputy director of the State Administration of Radio,
Film and Television.  Screening schedules are “purely market driven,” the
newspaper reported, citing Tian. There is no “domestic film
protection month,” Tian was cited as saying. He was referring
to the “closing months” of the year when dozens of Chinese
movies are shown at domestic cinemas, according to China Daily.
Foreign films shun these months due to “business
considerations,” Tian was cited as saying.  China’s domestic box office receipts reached 13.27 billion
 yuan  ($2.13 billion) in the first 10 months, rising 40 percent
from a year earlier, the newspaper cited Tian as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
