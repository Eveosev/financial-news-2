Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
told French magazine  Politique Internationale  he would be
willing to stay in the job if legislative elections in April
2013 fail to produce a majority capable of governing.  “If it were necessary, I would continue,” Monti was
quoted as saying in an interview with the quarterly journal. An
official for Monti’s office said the interview was conducted in
mid-September.  Monti, named to head the government in November 2011,said
on Sept. 27 in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s  Erik
Schatzker  that he would be available to serve again if needed.
He plans to step down after elections which must be held by
April.  “Italy must return to a normal democratic process, and
there is no reason why this election should not produce a
majority capable of governing,” he told Politique
Internationale. “What I have said recently is that, if it
appeared impossible to form such a majority, I would remain.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
