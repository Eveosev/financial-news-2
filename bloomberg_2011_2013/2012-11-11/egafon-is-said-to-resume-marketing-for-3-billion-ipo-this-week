OAO MegaFon (MFON) ,  Russia ’s second-largest
mobile-phone company by customers, plans to resume one of the
country’s biggest initial public offerings as early as this
week, according to people with knowledge of the matter.  The company may decide as early as today on a schedule for
an investor roadshow, after receiving approval from the U.K.
Listing Authority for the stock sale, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because the plan is confidential. The
preliminary schedule includes Moscow, London, New York,
 Frankfurt  and a Nordic capital, one of the people said.  MegaFon, which plans to complete the IPO before the end of
the year in a dual listing in London and Moscow, last month
postponed a marketing campaign to include details of an
acquisition and third-quarter earnings. Investors value the
company controlled by billionaire  Alisher Usmanov  at $10 billion
to $11 billion, people familiar with the matter said last month,
meaning a sale of a 20 percent stake could raise $2 billion.  “The timing of the IPO depends on how quickly the
prospectus can be updated and finalized,” the Moscow-based
company said yesterday in an e-mail to Bloomberg. “We intend to
hold the IPO this year.”  TeliaSonera Disputes  MegaFon’s IPO is a part of shareholder agreement reached in
April when billionaire Mikhail Fridman’s Altimo cashed out of
the operator and Usmanov boosted his ownership, resolving years
of governance disputes with co-owner  TeliaSonera AB. (TLSN)  As part of
the IPO, Stockholm-based TeliaSonera plans to divest a stake of
as much as 10.6 percent, keeping at least 25 percent ownership.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s largest oil producer, raised $10.4
billion in an IPO in 2006. That was followed a year later by  VTB
Bank’s (VTBR)  $8 billion stock sale.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the biggest
aluminum producer, raised $2.2 billion in a Hong Kong listing in
2010.  Russian companies are returning to stock offerings after
the central bank sold a $5.2 billion stake in  OAO Sberbank (SBER)  in
September. MD Medical Group Investments Plc , Russia’s largest
chain of maternity centers, raised $289 million in a London IPO
last month. UTair Aviation is considering selling shares on
international markets next year.  Profit Jumps  MegaFon said last week its third-quarter  profit  rose 20
percent to a record 14.9 billion rubles ($473 million), as
customer gains helped boost revenue 12 percent to 71.2 billion
rubles.  Data revenue accounted for 13 percent of sales as customers
browsed the Web and sent e-mail on mobile devices. Mobile
broadband will remain the main driver for phone companies’
revenue, according to UralSib Capital. Usmanov also controls
smaller operator Scartel, known under the brand Yota, which  is
working  with MegaFon in developing a faster network.  The quarterly results support MegaFon’s planned IPO as
revenue growth was solid and operating profit before
depreciation and amortization reached 45 percent of sales,
Alexander Kazbegi, an analyst at  Renaissance Capital , said last
week. Rivals  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , or MTS, and  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) 
are set to report third-quarter earnings Nov. 14.  Euroset Takeover  At the end of the third quarter, MTS had 70.7 million users
in Russia, MegaFon had 62.8 million, and VimpelCom 56.2 million,
according to Moscow-based researcher AC&M Consulting. Russia had
161 percent mobile penetration at the end of September, AC&M
said.  MegaFon agreed last month to buy a 25 percent stake of
handset retailer  Euroset Holding NV , and secured an option to
acquire another 25 percent from Usmanov. The 50 percent holding
is valued at $1.33 billion, according to the company. VimpelCom
will continue to own the remaining 50 percent stake.  Telefonica SA (TEF) , Spain’s largest phone company, last month
raised 1.45 billion euros ($1.8 billion) selling shares in its
German division in Frankfurt.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and Sberbank CIB are managing MegaFon’s
share sale with help from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
and VTB Capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
