posted last week the biggest slump since August, sending the
benchmark index of Chinese stocks traded in  New York  lower, as
the nation’s economic slowdown cuts into corporate earnings at a
time the country is changing its leadership.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in New York lost 2.2 percent to 92.7 last week,
the biggest retreat since July. Spreadtrum dropped as JPMorgan

slowest pace since 2009 and led companies to miss analysts’
 earnings estimates  by 8.5 percent last quarter.  “It’s the uncertainty amid  China ’s power transition that’s
damping the stock market,”  Timothy Ghriskey , chief investment
officer at New York-based Solaris Group LLC, which manages about
$2 billion in assets including  Chinese stocks , said by phone on
Nov. 9. “Investors are not sure if new leaders will focus on
growth and when. What we really want to see is a rebound in
growth after quarters of slowdown.”  ETF Drops  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese

Spreadtrum to neutral from overweight on Nov. 9.  The company expects fourth-quarter sales of $189 million to
$196 million with gross margin remaining “flat” from the
previous three months, according to a Nov. 8 statement. The
revenue forecast fell short of the $197.3 million average

3.8 percent.  The name of the combined company is Pactera Technology
International Ltd., according to a Nov. 9 statement. VanceInfo’s
listing on the New York Stock Exchange will be canceled from

underlying shares in China’s biggest offshore oil explorer.  The company is confident its proposed $15.1 billion
takeover of  Canada ’s Nexen will be completed by the end of the
year, Chairman Wang Yilin said at a meeting held as part of the
18th Communist Party Congress in Beijing on Nov. 9. The comment
came after Canada extended its review of state-owned Cnooc’s bid
