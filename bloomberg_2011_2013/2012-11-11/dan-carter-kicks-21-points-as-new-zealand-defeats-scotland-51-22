Dan Carter  kicked 21 points as world
champion  New Zealand  started its European rugby tour with a 51-
22 win over Scotland in Edinburgh.  The All Blacks scored six tries to Scotland’s three as the
home side tried in vain to register a first win over New
Zealand. The result stretched the visitors’ unbeaten run to 18
Tests.  Top-ranked New Zealand took an early lead, 30-year-old
Carter slotting a penalty for offside. The visitors then paid
for an error by Carter, whose pass was intercepted by Matt
Scott. He switched the ball to Tim Visser, who marked his home
debut with the opening try. Greig Laidlaw added the conversion.  New Zealand’s passing clicked into gear as Israel Dagg,
Julian Savea, Cory Jane and  Andrew Hore  added tries to send the
All Blacks into a 34-10 lead as Carter kicked 11 more points in
the half. Laidlaw scored a penalty for the hosts, who are ranked
ninth by the International Rugby Board.  Just before halftime the Scots laid siege to the All
Blacks’ line and got a second try through Geoff Cross. Laidlaw’s
conversion left the halftime score at 34-17.  Visser got a second try while the All Blacks’ Adam Thomson
was sin-binned after illegal use of the feet at a ruck.  New Zealand soaked up home pressure, then added tries from
Savea and  Ben Smith , both converted by Carter, as the Scots ran
out of momentum.  Yesterday,  England  routed Fiji 54-12, Argentina upset Wales
26-12, France beat Australia 33-6 and South Africa beat Ireland
16-12. Italy had a 28-23 win over  Tonga .  The autumn series of matches in Europe will affect the
seedings for the 2015 Rugby  World Cup . The International Rugby
Board rankings as of Dec. 3 will be used to band the 12
automatic qualifiers in the 20-team tournament in England, with
the first four placed at the top of the four five-team groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
