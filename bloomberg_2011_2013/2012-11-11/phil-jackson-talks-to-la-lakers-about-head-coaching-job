Phil Jackson  is discussing a
possible return to the  Los Angeles Lakers  for the third time as
head coach following the dismissal of  Mike Brown , according to
the National Basketball Association team’s website.  Jackson, 67, met yesterday with General Manager Mitch Kupchak and Executive Vice President Jim Buss. The three decided
to continue their discussion in a few days.  Bernie Bickerstaff is directing the team as interim head
coach. He earned his first victory two nights ago when the
Lakers, who started the season 1-4 under Brown, defeated the
Golden State Warriors 101-77. The Lakers host the Sacramento
Kings tonight.  Jackson led the Lakers to five of his record 11 NBA
coaching titles. He left the Lakers bench after the 2010-11
season in which the club went 57-25 and lost in the Western
Conference semifinals. He was replaced by Brown, who had
installed the so-called Princeton offense to replace Jackson’s
triangle.  Jackson is favored to replace Brown, followed by former  New
York  Knicks coach  Mike D’Antoni , former Lakers assistant and
player Brian Shaw and former Portland Trail Blazers coach Nate McMillan, according to R.J. Bell of Las Vegas-based Pregame.com.
Longer shots for the position are former Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan, former Houston Rockets coach Jeff Van Gundy, Mike Fratello who coached the Memphis Grizzlies, former Philadelphia
76ers coach Eddie Jordan and Lakers associate coach Chuck Person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
