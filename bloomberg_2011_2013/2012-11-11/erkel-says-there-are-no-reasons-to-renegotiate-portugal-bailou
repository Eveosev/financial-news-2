German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
there are no reasons to renegotiate the terms of  Portugal ’s
financial aid program as the country’s government tries to
comply with the bailout plan requested in April 2011.  “At the moment there is no reason to renegotiate them,”
Merkel said in an interview with Portuguese television station
 RTP1 . “Portugal has fulfilled the obligations, it has
implemented the measures -- implemented them in a very
courageous way.”  Merkel, who is visiting Lisbon tomorrow, said she doesn’t
expect Portugal to get a second rescue package. “At the moment,
the measures have been well implemented and we’re hoping that
the program will be a success,” she said.  Portugal is battling rising joblessness and a deepening
recession as the government raises taxes to meet the terms of a
78 billion-euro ($99 billion) aid plan from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund . Portugal has already been
given more time to narrow its budget shortfall after  tax revenue 
missed forecasts and the economy is set to contract for a third
year in 2013.  Portugal aims to reduce its  budget deficit  to 5 percent of
gross domestic product this year instead of the previous goal of
4.5 percent, Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said on Sept. 11
after EU and IMF officials agreed on the new targets. It’s now
aiming for a deficit of 4.5 percent in 2013 rather than a prior
goal of 3 percent and will only meet the EU’s 3 percent limit in
2014, when it targets a 2.5 percent gap.  To contact the reporter on this story:
