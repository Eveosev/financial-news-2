New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg  has
 modified  the city’s $69 billion budget with $1.6 billion in
spending cuts over the next 18 months to close a current $635
million deficit created when a court stopped the city from
selling additional taxi medallions.  About $600 million of the spending reductions, dated Nov. 9
by the Office of Management and the Budget and announced today
by the mayor’s office, plus $68 million in higher-than-
previously-forecast revenue, will make up for the lost taxi
medallion sales and balance the current budget. For 2014,
$1 billion in trimmed spending plus $425 million in taxi-sales
revenue will shrink the deficit to about $1.15 billion from the
$2.5 billion forecast when the plan passed in June. The city’s
fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30 each year.  Bloomberg assumes that an appeals judge will reverse an
August lower court ruling blocking the sales. Supreme Court
Justice Arthur F. Engoron declared the medallion sale
unconstitutional, saying the mayor should have received approval
from the City Council, not the state Legislature.  The budget for fiscal year 2014 anticipates $790 million in
taxi medallion revenue, $365 million already included in the
budget passed last June and $425 million moved from fiscal year
2013 into fiscal year 2014. It also anticipates $68 million more
in  tax revenue  in the current fiscal year than had been forecast
last June.  Court Order  Efforts to recover from  Hurricane Sandy  won’t be affected
by the agency spending cuts the mayor has ordered, his office
said in an e-mail. The number of police officers and
firefighters will remain the same, and the city intends to
increase the Sanitation Department by at least 100 workers
within the next year, the mayor’s office said.  The city had planned to sell 2,000 medallions, adding to
its fleet of about 13,000 cabs, and reap at least $1 billion in
fiscal years 2013 and 2014 until Engoron blocked the sale with a
court order. It now says it expects $790 million from such
sales, in the event it wins its appeal of Engoron’s decision.  The medallion plan was part of a restructuring of taxi
service that would have also added a new taxi service for
residents of boroughs outside  Manhattan .  State law requires the city to submit a balanced budget.
The mayor will submit a preliminary plan for the 2014 fiscal
year that begins July 1, 2013, by early February.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
