Entergy Corp. (ETR) ’s FitzPatrick nuclear
power plant near Oswego, New York, shut down after a transformer
fire this morning, according to a spokeswoman.  The plant halted operations automatically after the fire
was detected at about 5:45 a.m. in the main transformer, which
is outside the nuclear reactor, Tammy Holden said in a telephone
interview. An on-site fire crew extinguished the fire with help
from the fire department in nearby Scriba, New York, Holden
said.  The 838-megawatt plant will stay closed until the cause of
the fire is determined and repairs are made, Holden said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
