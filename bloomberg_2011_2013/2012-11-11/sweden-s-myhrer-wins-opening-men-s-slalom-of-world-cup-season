Sweden’s Andre Myhrer won the
opening slalom of the men’s  World Cup  ski season, finishing
ahead of Austria’s Marcel Hirscher and Sweden’s Jens Byggmark in
Levi, Finland.  The 29-year-old posted a time of  1 minute, 49.55 seconds 
over two runs, 0.06 seconds faster than Hirscher. Byggmark was

victory in the final race.  Yesterday, Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany won the women’s

Austria crashed on her first run, while overall World Cup
titleholder Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. skipped the race.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
