$23.3 million, since Sept. 1, the association said today in its
weekly bulletin. Exports in the latest week included 269 tons of
the Giza 88 variety and 998 tons of Giza 86, it said.  Egypt produces the worldâ€™s finest extra-long staple cotton,
which is stronger and softer than shorter staple cotton, and is
used in high-quality clothing. Switzerland, Bangladesh and  India 
are the top importers of Egyptian cotton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
