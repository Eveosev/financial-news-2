Unidentified gunmen opened fire at a
camp of Egyptâ€™s Central Security Forces in the  Sinai Peninsula 
near the border with Israel, the  Interior Ministry  said.  No one was injured in the attack that took place today in
the city of Rafah, the ministry said in an e-mailed statement

operations in the northern Sinai amid frequent attacks in the
