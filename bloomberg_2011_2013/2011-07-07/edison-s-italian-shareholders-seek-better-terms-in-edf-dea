Edison SpA (EDN) ’s Italian shareholders,
negotiating a plan by shareholder Electricite de France SA to
gain control of the utility, said they’re seeking better terms
in anticipation of higher gas-asset valuations following Japan’s
nuclear crisis.  Talks must bring about an “improvement” on the terms and
take into account the “evolution of the national and
international context in the past few months, particularly with
respect to nuclear,” according to an e-mailed statement from
Brescia utility  A2A SpA (A2A) , which leads the Italian shareholders.  EDF reached a preliminary agreement with the shareholders
in March to take a larger stake in Milan-based Edison by
swapping assets and cash. The Italian holders now want
negotiations to take into consideration a possible increase in
the value of Edison’s gas assets amid global moves to scale back
nuclear programs following  Japan ’s atomic accident at Fukushima.  Edison’s biggest shareholder is Transalpina di Energia, a
company half-owned by Paris-based EDF and half by Delmi SpA,
which in turn is owned by A2A and other Italian companies.
Transalpina has a 61.2 percent stake in Edison. Taking into
account direct and indirect stakes, EDF controls about 50
percent of the utility, Italy’s biggest after Enel SpA.  Edison’s shareholders have until Sept. 15 to reach an
agreement, after which EDF and Delmi have to proceed with an
auction of Edison shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
