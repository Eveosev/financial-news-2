Naftna Industrija Srbije AD said its
joint venture in Bosnia-Herzegovina with OAO Zarubezhneft’s
Neftegazinkor unit is to start oil and gas exploration after
local authorities gave it a 28-year concession.  The concession applies to the territory of Republika
Srpska, the Serb-run part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose
government agreed that Jadran-Naftagas d.o.o., the locally
registered joint venture, may explore oil and gas for three
years and exploit any commercial finds in 25 following years,
NIS said in an e-mailed statement today.  “This practically marks the beginning of oil and gas
exploration in Republika Srpska which, we hope, will result in
finding commercial quantities of carbohydrates in the area,”
the company said.  The joint venture in Republika Srpska is 66 percent owned
by NIS and 34 percent by Neftegazinkor. NIS is majority-owned by
 Russia ’s OAO Gazprom Neft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
