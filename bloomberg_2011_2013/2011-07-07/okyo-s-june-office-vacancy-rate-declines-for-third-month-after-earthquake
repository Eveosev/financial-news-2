Tokyo ’s Office vacancy rates fell for
a third month in June, recovering from a record high in March
when the nation was hit by a record earthquake, according Miki
Shoji Co.  The measure of unoccupied office units in Tokyo fell to
8.81 percent in June from 8.88 percent a month earlier,
according to the Tokyo-based privately held office brokerage
company. The average office rent in Tokyo’s five main business
districts of Chiyoda, Chuo, Minato, Shinjuku and Shibuya fell to
a record low, it said.  The vacancy rate in Tokyo, which had been on rising trend
since 2008, is starting to recover after it reached a record
high of 9.19 percent in March when  Japan  was hit by a magnitude-
9 earthquake. The office vacancy rate may peak around April 2012
when Japan’s economic growth is expected to gather pace,
according to Credit Suisse Securities (Japan) Ltd.  “Vacancy rates could decline in the period through October
2011, when few new buildings are scheduled for completion,”
said  Masahiro Mochizuki , an analyst at Credit Suisse, in a
report yesterday. “We expect the vacancy rate to improve
gradually in 2012.”  The average office rent in Tokyo’s five main business
districts fell to 17,292 yen ($214) per tsubo from 17,400 yen
per tsubo in May, Miki Shoji said. One tsubo, a standard measure
of property area in Japan, is 3.3 square meters, or 35.5 square
feet.  The  Topix Real Estate Index (TPREAL)  dropped 1 percent at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, making it the second-worst performer among the
33 industry groups that make up the benchmark Topix index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
