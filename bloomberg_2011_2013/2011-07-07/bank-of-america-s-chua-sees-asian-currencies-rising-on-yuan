Hak Bin Chua, a Singapore-based
regional economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, comments on
the outlook for Asian currencies at a press briefing in
Singapore today.  The bank predicts the  Thai baht  will strengthen 8.4 percent
to 28 per dollar by year-end and Malaysia’s ringgit will gain
7.5 percent to 2.8. The Philippine peso will rise 5.8 percent to
40.500 and Indonesia’s rupiah will advance 0.5 percent to 8,500,
according to the lender.  “Southeast Asian stocks, currencies and bonds have
benefited from the surge in capital inflows over the last two
years. The tide of capital flows into  Southeast Asia  may ease
when quantitative easing stops.”  There will be “slight potential appreciation” for Asian
currencies as the “Chinese yuan appreciation will continue to
drive up” these currencies, he said.  “The  Singapore dollar  and Malaysian ringgit have
historically been highly correlated with the yuan.  “I believe that  China  would have to use their currency as
a policy tool to allow them to fight inflation. We project
further strength in the yuan, expecting it to cross 6.30 by
year-end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
