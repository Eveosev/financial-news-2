The  London  Metal Exchange amended its
policy for approval of delivery points to assure compliance with
anti-bribery and corruption legislation.  A description of the location’s corruption and bribery risk
is required, and should describe if the location has laws
relating to corruption of public officials, the LME said in a
notice to members today. If a location’s corruption risk
changes, the LME “retains the right to limit the capacity in
that location or to delist it,” according to the notice.  The exchange has updated its policy to ensure compliance
particularly with the U.K.  Bribery Act 2010 , said Miriam
Heywood, a spokeswoman for the exchange in London.  The LME has 37 approved warehouse locations covering the
U.S.,  Europe , the  Middle East  and Far East, according to its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
