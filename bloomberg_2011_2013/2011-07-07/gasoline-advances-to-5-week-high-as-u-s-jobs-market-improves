Gasoline rose to a five-week high
after two reports showed the U.S. labor market may be stronger,
indicating that job growth may accelerate in the second half of
the year and fuel demand will improve.  Futures rose as much as 3 percent as U.S. companies added
157,000 jobs in June, according to a private payrolls report by
from ADP Employer Services. The Labor Department reported that
first-time jobless claims dropped by 14,000 to 418,000 in the
week ended July 2.  “The market seemed to gain momentum after the ADP jobs
report came out because people were surprised ADP reported as
much job growth as they did,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for August delivery gained 8.05 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $3.0781 a gallon at 9:46 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $3.0874, the highest
intraday level since May 31. Futures have risen seven of the
past eight days, adding 11 percent.  Today’s Labor Department data show the four-week moving
average of jobless claims, a less volatile measure than the
weekly figures, fell to 424,750 last week from 427,750 in the
previous seven days. A department’s report tomorrow may show
overall payrolls rose by 100,000 in June, according to the
median forecast of 83 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  API Report  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported
yesterday that gasoline inventories fell 1.91 million barrels
last week, distillate stockpiles declined 1.63 million barrels
and supplies of crude oil dropped 3.17 million barrels.  “We had momentum coming in because API showed a draw in
crude and products yesterday,” said Lipow.  The Energy Department will probably report that gasoline
stockpiles fell 150,000 barrels last week, according to the
median estimate of 16 analysts in another survey by Bloomberg.
Supplies of industrial, trucking and home-heating fuels rose
900,000 barrels, according to the survey.  The Energy Department is scheduled to report inventories
for the week ended July 1 at 11 a.m. today in  Washington , a day
later than usual because of the July 4 Independence Day holiday.  Heating oil for August delivery added 8.15 cents, or 2.8
percent, to $3.0448 a gallon on the exchange. Prices touched
$3.0496, the highest level since June 15.  Regular gasoline at the pump rose 1.4 cents to $3.583 a
gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
