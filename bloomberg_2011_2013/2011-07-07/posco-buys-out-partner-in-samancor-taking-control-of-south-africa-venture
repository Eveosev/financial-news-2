(Corrects to say  South Africa  accounts for output in
second paragraph of a story originally published July 7.)  Posco (005490) ,  South Korea ’s biggest
steelmaker, bought out partner Samancor Ltd.’s stake to take
full ownership of Poschrome Ltd., a ferrochrome producer in
South Africa, improving control over supplies of the material.  Posco, which didn’t release the value of the deal,
previously held 50 percent of the unit in South Africa, the
country that accounted for 41 percent of global ferrochrome
output in 2010 according to the website of Merafe Resources
Ltd., operator of the world’s largest ferrochrome producer with
Xstrata Plc. Chung Jae Woong, a Posco spokesman, confirmed the
Poschrome acquisition had been agreed when reached by phone
today.  The South Korean company is strengthening security of
supplies of ferrochrome, used in stainless-steel production.
Poschrome provides about 60,000 metric tons a year, according to
a statement on Posco’s website, which says the company imports
about 480,000 tons of ferrochrome annually.  Sunel Pretorius, a  Samancor  spokeswoman, didn’t respond to
a voice and text message to her mobile phone today. The
Johannesburg-based company is controlled by Netherlands-based
International Mineral Resources BV.  To contact the reporters on this story:
