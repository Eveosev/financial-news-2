Two men were indicted in  Seattle  on
charges that included conspiracy to use a weapon of mass
destruction in an alleged plot to attack a U.S. military
processing center in Seattle.  Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, also known as Joseph Anthony Davis,
33, of Seattle, and Walli Mujahidh, also known as Frederick
Domingue Jr., 32, of  Los Angeles , were charged with conspiracy
to murder U.S. officers and conspiracy to use weapons of mass
destruction, U.S. Attorney Jenny A. Durkan in Seattle said in an
e-mailed statement. A federal grand jury indicted the men on a
total of nine criminal counts.  “Under close monitoring by federal agents the men took
possession of high powered assault rifles they planned to use in
an attack,” according to the statement.  The weapons had been disabled. Law enforcement officials
had been monitoring Abdul-Latif and Mujahidh after Seattle
police got a tip from an informant who was approached about
participating in the attack and supplying the men with firearms,
according to the statement.  The two men, who face life in prison if convicted, are
scheduled to appear today before U.S. Magistrate Judge James P.
Donohue, according to the statement.  Erik Levin, a lawyer for Abdul-Latif, and Lee A. Covell, an
attorney for Mujahidh, didn’t immediately return calls seeking
comment.  The case is U.S. v. Abdul-Latif, Mujahidh, 11-mj-00292,
U.S. District Court, Western District of  Washington  (Seattle).  To contact the reporter on this story:
