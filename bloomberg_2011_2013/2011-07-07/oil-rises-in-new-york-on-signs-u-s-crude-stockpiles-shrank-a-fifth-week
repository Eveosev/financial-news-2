Oil surged to a three-week high in
 New York  on signs that the U.S. economic recovery is whittling
down crude inventories in the world’s largest user of the
commodity.  Futures climbed as much as 2.1 percent in New York after
reports showed that U.S. companies added 157,000 workers in June
and applications for  unemployment benefits  declined last week.
The  American Petroleum Institute  said yesterday that crude
inventories dropped 3.2 million barrels last week. An Energy
Department report due today is also forecast by analysts to show
a drop. Morgan Stanley said it is bullish on oil in the second
half of 2011 as production capacity falls.  “Uncertainty in the euro zone is contrasting with
improving numbers in the U.S.,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Capital in London. “For now the short-term
sentiment in oil market is positive as the market tracks
macroeconomic themes, though the stronger dollar could cap gains
in commodities.”  Crude for August delivery gained as much as $2.05 to $98.70
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . That’s the highest since June 15. It was at $98.63 at
1:51 p.m. London time. Yesterday, the contract fell to $96.65,
the lowest since July 1.  Brent crude  for August settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange rose $2.69, or 2.4 percent, to $116.31 a
barrel. The European benchmark was at a premium of $17.68 to
U.S. futures. The difference reached a record $22.29 on June 15.  U.S. Labor Market  U.S. initial jobless claims fell by 14,000 to 418,000 in
the week ended July 2, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a drop to 420,000.  A report from ADP Employer Services today showed that
companies in the U.S. added 157,000 workers to their payrolls in
June. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News indicated an advance of 70,000.  The Labor Department may say tomorrow that nonfarm payrolls
climbed by 100,000 workers in June, after a 54,000 increase in
May, the smallest in eight months, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The jobless
rate probably held at 9.1 percent.  Bullish Outlook  While prices of light, sweet crude may decline in “coming
weeks,” Morgan Stanley remains bullish on the outlook for oil
in the second half of the year, the bank said in a report.  Brent’s premium to U.S. crude may widen to at least $40 a
barrel between now and the middle of 2012, according to
Citigroup Global Markets Inc.  Increased output from western  Canada  and the U.S. mid-
continent has led to near-record supplies at Cushing,  Oklahoma ,
the delivery point for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate,
the bank said in a note yesterday.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. today reiterated its long-trading
recommendation for Brent futures.  “We continue to expect that oil demand growth fueled by
moderate economic growth expectations will be sufficient to draw
down crude oil inventories,” Goldman analysts led by London-
based Jeffrey Currie said in a report dated today.  U.S. crude inventories decreased 2.5 million barrels, or
0.7 percent, from 359.5 million barrels in the week ended July
1, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News before today’s Energy Department report. That
would be a fifth weekly drop, the longest decline since January.  Gasoline stockpiles probably slid 150,000 barrels from
213.2 million last week, based on the survey. Distillate-fuel
supplies, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, are
expected to have risen 900,000 barrels from 142.3 million.  The Energy Department is scheduled to release its weekly
report at 11 a.m. in Washington, a day late because of the
Fourth of July holiday.  Oil may extend gains in New York if futures settle above
technical resistance marked by a Bollinger Band, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The middle band on the daily chart
is at $96.97 a barrel today. A breach of resistance usually
means prices will rise further.  To contact the reporter on this story:
