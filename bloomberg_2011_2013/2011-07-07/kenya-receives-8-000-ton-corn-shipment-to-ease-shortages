Kenya received a shipment of 8,000
metric tons of corn yesterday to help ease shortages in the
drought-affected country, the chairman of the Cereal Millers
Association said.  Another shipment is expected next week, with plans to
import 54,000 tons from Zambia and Malawi this year, Diamond
Lalji said by phone today.  Kenya rejected 5,000 tons of corn from Malawi and Zambia
this month because it was discolored, Business Daily reported on
July 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
