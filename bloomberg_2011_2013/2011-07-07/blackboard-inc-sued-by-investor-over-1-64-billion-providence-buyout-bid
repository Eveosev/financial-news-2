Blackboard Inc. (BBBB) , an educational-
software maker, was sued in Delaware Chancery Court by an
investor contending the company’s stock is undervalued in a
proposed $1.64 billion buyout by Providence Equity Partners Inc.  The company is being sold through “an unfair process and
for an unfair price,” shareholder Astor BK Realty Trust
contends in a complaint filed today in Wilmington, Delaware.  “Indeed, one analyst, Wedbush, believes that Blackboard is
worth at least $50 to $65 per share as a takeover target,”
Astor lawyers said in court papers.  The Providence, Rhode Island-based investment firm agreed
July 1 to buy Blackboard, of  Washington , for $45 a share in
cash, a 21 percent premium at the time.  Astor is seeking class-action or group status for the
lawsuit on behalf of common stockholders and an order to stop
the buyout or award damages.  Michael Stanton, a spokesman for Blackboard, didn’t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the suit.  Blackboard rose 2 cents to $44.20 at 12:48 p.m. in Nasdaq
stock market trading.  The case is Astor BK Realty Trust v. Chasen,  Delaware 
Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
