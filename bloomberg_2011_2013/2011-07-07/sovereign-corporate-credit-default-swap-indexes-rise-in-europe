The cost of insuring European
sovereign debt surged to a record, led by  Portugal , on concern
the region’s sovereign debt crisis is deepening.  Credit-default swaps on Portugal jumped 94 basis points to
an all-time high of 1,029 basis points, signaling a 59 percent
chance of default within five years, according to CMA prices at
2:30 p.m. in London. Swaps on Ireland,  Greece  and Portuguese
companies also rose to records.  “The downgrade drove home to everybody this is way not
over,” said Anke Richter, a strategist at Mizuho International
Plc in London. “More and more, people realize this is something
we’re going to be dealing with for a long time.”  Investors are betting the crisis that started in Greece
will overwhelm Portugal, which had its credit rating cut to junk
by Moody’s Investors Service this week, and spread to bigger
economies. Disagreements over how to involve banks and insurers
in Greece’s second bailout are also undermining confidence.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western  Europe  Index of swaps on 15
governments climbed 2 basis points to a record 251. An increase
signals deteriorating perceptions of  credit quality .  Swaps on Ireland rose 60 basis points to 903, signaling a
54 percent chance of default. Greece jumped 78 to 2,218 basis
points, and it now has an 85 percent probability of failing to
adhere to its commitments.  Corporate Swaps  Contracts on Energias de Portugal SA, the nation’s biggest
power company, soared 68 basis points to 551,  Banco Espirito
Santo SA (BES)  surged 96 to 968 and  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) 
jumped 99 to 1,126, CMA prices show.  The cost of insuring financial and corporate bonds fell,
reversing an earlier rise, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Companies in the U.S. added 157,000 workers to their
payrolls in June, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services, bolstering confidence in tomorrow’s Labor Department
job report. European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
raised Europe’s benchmark interest rates to 1.5 percent, the
highest since March 2009.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers decreased 3 basis points to 164 and the
subordinated gauge dropped 9 to 287.5.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings declined 5 basis points to 406,
the highest in more than a week. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index
of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings fell 1.5 basis
points to 108.75.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.3 million) of debt for five years is
equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer face value
in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent
should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
