The Swiss franc extended its decline
against the dollar after a report showed companies in the U.S.
added more workers than forecast last month.  The franc was 1 percent weaker at 94.79 centimes per dollar
as of 1:19 p.m. in  London . It fell 0.6 percent to 1.2089 per
euro.  Employers added 157,000 workers in June, according to ADP
Employer Services. The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for an advance of 70,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
