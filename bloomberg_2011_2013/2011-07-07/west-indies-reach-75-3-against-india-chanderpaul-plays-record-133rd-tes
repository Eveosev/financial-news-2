The West Indies reached 75-3 after
being sent in to bat by  India  on the rain-affected opening day
of the third and final cricket Test in Dominica.  Ishant Sharma took two wickets and Praveen Kumar got the
other as top-ranked India reduced the home team to 35-3 before
Darren Bravo and Shivnarine Chanderpaul shared an unbroken 40-
run stand to steady the innings.  Chanderpaul, making a record 133rd elite Test appearance
for the Caribbean team, will resume on 17 not out, with Bravo on
22. Only 31.1 of the scheduled 90 overs were possible on day one
because of rain.  India, which leads the best-of-three series 1-0, has never
won two Tests in a series in the Caribbean.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
