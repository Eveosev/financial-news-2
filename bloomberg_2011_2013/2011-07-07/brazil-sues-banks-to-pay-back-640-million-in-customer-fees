Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4) , Banco
Santander Brasil SA and HSBC Bank Brasil SA were sued by a
federal prosecutor seeking reimbursement of more than 1 billion
reais ($640 million) in fees charged to customers for services
that should have been free.  Claudio Gheventer filed five suits against the Sao Paulo-
based lenders for disrespecting central bank rules on tariffs,
the federal prosecutor’s office in  Rio de Janeiro  said yesterday
in a statement on its website. The banks charged the fees
between 2008 and 2010, according to the statement.  The prosecutor sent letters to the banks in March and May,
recommending reimbursement of the fees, according to the
statement. The suits were filed when the lenders didn’t return
the money, the statement said. Three of the lawsuits were filed
against Itau for different charges, according to the statement.  Itau said it received a recommendation from the
prosecutor’s office three months ago and has been in contact
with authorities to provide information on the fees, according
to an e-mailed statement.  Santander said it won’t comment because it hasn’t received
an official communication relating to the lawsuits, according to
an e-mailed statement.  HSBC Bank Brasil SA is the local unit of  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ,
which declined to comment in an e-mailed statement.  -- Editors: William Ahearn, Steve Dickson  To contact the reporter on this story:
