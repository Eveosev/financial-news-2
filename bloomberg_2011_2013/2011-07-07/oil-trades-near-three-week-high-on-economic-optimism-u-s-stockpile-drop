Oil traded near the highest in three
weeks in  New York , heading for a second weekly gain, as
investors bet that shrinking stockpiles and signs of economic
recovery in the U.S. indicated fuel demand may increase.  Futures advanced earlier after data showed companies in the
U.S. added twice as many workers as forecast in June. A Labor
Department report today may show employers added 105,000 jobs
last month, according to a Bloomberg News survey. Crude supplies
fell 889,000 barrels to 358.6 million last week, the lowest
level since April, an Energy Department report showed.  “Growth is likely to be a bit healthier in the second
half,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist at
National Australia Bank Ltd. in  Melbourne , who predicts oil in
New York will average $113 a barrel in the third quarter. The
ADP data “could mean stronger employment numbers than what the
market is expecting, which is good for U.S. growth and oil
demand,” he said.  Crude for August delivery gained as much as 30 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $98.97 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , and was at $98.67 at 12:33 p.m. Sydney
time. The contract yesterday climbed $2.02 to $98.67, the
highest since June 14. Prices are 3.9 percent higher this week
and up 31 percent the past year.  Brent oil for August settlement was at $117.98 a barrel,
down 61 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.
The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $19.34 to
U.S. futures. The difference reached a record $22.29 on June 15.  Cushing Stockpiles  Stockpiles of crude at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for West Texas Intermediate oil, the grade traded in New
York, slipped 460,000 barrels to 37 million barrels last week,
the Energy Department report showed.  A 2.5 million-barrel decline in total U.S. crude supplies
was projected for last week, according to the median estimate of
15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. The U.S. is the world’s
biggest consumer of the commodity.  Gasoline inventories decreased 634,000 barrels last week to
212.5 million, the report showed. They were forecast to fall
150,000 barrels, according to the survey. Distillate-fuel
supplies, a category that includes heating oil and diesel,
dropped 191,000 barrels to 142.1 million.  “The DOE report had bullish headline factors, but it was
hardly as bullish as prices would suggest,”      Peter Beutel ,
president of Cameron Hanover Inc., an energy adviser in  New
Canaan ,  Connecticut , said in an e-mailed note. “This market now
has such powerful upward momentum behind it that everything is
coming up bullish.”  Employment Data  U.S. companies added 157,000 workers in June, according to
data from ADP Employer Services. An increase of 70,000 was
projected, according to the median forecast by Bloomberg News.  The U.S. added 105,000 jobs in June, almost double the
54,000 created a month earlier, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey before a Labor Department report
today. Private hiring climbed 125,000 last month, while the
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent, the survey showed.  Industrial production in  Germany , Europe’s largest economy,
increased more than economists forecast in May, led by rising
output of investment goods such as machines. Production jumped
1.2 percent from April, when it fell a revised 0.8 percent, the
Economy Ministry in Berlin said yesterday. Economists forecast a
gain of 0.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
