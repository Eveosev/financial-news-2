Ghana ’s Jubilee oil field may reach
peak production in August or September, a month later than
planned, after boosting output to as much as 80,000 barrels a
day since the start of this month, according to  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) ,
the field’s operator.  “Output will rise to 120,000 barrels per day,” Gayheart
Mensah, spokesman for the company’s local unit, said in a
telephone interview today. “By this we are within our target of
reaching peak production level by the second half,” he said.  Dai Jones, president and general manager of Tullow Oil
Ghana Ltd., said on May 31 that output was set to increase to
120,000 barrels by July. Mensah declined to say why that
timeframe will be missed.  Discovered in 2007, the Jubilee field made Ghana the newest
oil exporter in  Africa  when production began in December. Total
output from the field to mid-June reached 10 million barrels,
Mensah said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
