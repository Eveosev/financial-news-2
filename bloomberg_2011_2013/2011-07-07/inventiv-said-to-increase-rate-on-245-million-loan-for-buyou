InVentiv Health Inc., increased the
proposed rate it will pay on a $245 million  term loan  to support
its acquisition of PharmaNet Development Group Inc., according
to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The provider of sales, marketing and consulting services to
health-care companies is offering to pay 5 percentage points to
5.25 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate for the loan, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private.  Somerset, New Jerse-based InVentiv had initially offered to
pay 4.25 percentage points to 4.5 percentage points more than
the benchmark, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
