U.K. economic growth slowed to a
virtual standstill in the second quarter, supporting the case
for the  Bank of England  to maintain record-low  interest rates ,
the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said.  Gross domestic product expanded 0.1 percent, the group,
whose clients include the Bank of England and the U.K. Treasury,
said in an e-mailed statement in London today. Government data
show the economy effectively stagnated over the fourth and first
quarters.  “One-off events” in April depressed growth in the second
quarter, Niesr said, referring to consecutive long weekends to
mark Easter and the royal wedding and to the supply disruptions
caused by the Japanese earthquake. The Bank of England held the
key interest rate at a record low of 0.5 percent today to aid
the recovery.  “Even accounting for these factors the underlying rate of
growth is still likely to be weak,” Niesr said. “These figures
do not provide a picture of economic growth that would support a
tightening of monetary policy at this juncture.”  Niesr said GDP rose 0.5 percent in the three months through
May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
