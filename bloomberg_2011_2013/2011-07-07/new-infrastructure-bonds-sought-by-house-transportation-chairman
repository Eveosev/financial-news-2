Representative John Mica, chairman of
the House transportation committee, said he’ll propose new types
of infrastructure bonds to a tax-writing committee later this
year.  The bonds will differ from the so-called Build America
Bonds created by President Barack Obama’s 2009 stimulus plan.
Terms of those bonds were “too generous,” Mica, a Florida
Republican, said at a press conference today in  Washington .  The Build America Bonds project was allowed to expire Dec.
31 under an agreement Obama reached with Republican lawmakers.
More than $174.1 billion of the taxable securities were sold
from April 2009 through Dec. 31, making them the fastest-growing
segment of the $2.8 trillion municipal market, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “I have my own ideas of what these bonds should look like,
but I’m not going to go into that now,” Mica said.  #<257310.120019.2.1.87.23378.96># To contact the reporter on this story:
