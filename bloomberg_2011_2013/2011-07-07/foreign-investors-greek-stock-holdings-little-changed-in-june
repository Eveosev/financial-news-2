Foreign investors’ holdings in
companies listed on the Greek stock exchange were little changed
last month, according to data released by Hellenic Exchanges SA,
the operator of the Athens bourse.  Non-resident investors held 51 percent of the market value
of all stocks listed on the Athens Stock Exchange in June,
compared with 49 percent in June 2010. In May, foreign investors
owned 51.2 percent, according to figures released on June 8. The
figure for April was 50.8 percent.  Greece ’s benchmark ASE share index has lost 11 percent this
year, as the country struggles to convince investors it will be
able to repay debt. Foreign investors accounted for 48 percent
of total turnover in June, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
