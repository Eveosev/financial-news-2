Accidental drug overdoses from
prescription pills have more than doubled in the past decade as
deaths from illegal drugs decreased, a  Florida  study found.  Prescription medications were implicated in 76 percent of
all overdose deaths in Florida between 2003 and 2009, while
illicit drugs like cocaine and heroin were present in 34 percent
of deaths, according to data compiled by the  Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention  in Atlanta. Ten percent of overdoses came
from a mix of both illegal and prescription drugs.  Unintentional poisoning is the second leading cause of
injury death in the U.S. after automobile accidents, accounting
for 29,846 deaths nationwide in 2007, the CDC’s Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report, said. In 2007, the U.S. government
began the  Prescription Drug Monitoring Program , a $9 million
program that provides state funding for recording and monitoring
prescription drug use.  “By 2009, the number of deaths involving  prescription
drugs  was four times the number involving illicit drugs,” the
report said. “These findings indicate the need to strengthen
interventions aimed at reducing overdose deaths from
prescription drugs.”  The number of annual deaths from lethal concentrations of
prescription medicines increased 84 percent from 2003 to 2009,
while deadly overdoses of illegal drugs fell 21 percent. Deaths
from the narcotic painkiller oxycodone and anxiety medicine
alprazolam, sold under the brand name Xanax, more than tripled.  Availability  “The sense is that the widespread availability of
prescription drugs is causing people to switch from illicit
drugs like cocaine and heroin,” Leonard Paulozzi, a medical
epidemiologist at CDC’s Injury Center, said in a phone
interview.  Paulozzi said most prescription overdoses were in men
between the ages of 45 and 54.  Heroin death rates dropped 62 percent in the period.
Cocaine overdoses increased until 2007, and declined in 2008 and
2009, researchers found. Methadone rates rose 79 percent, the
study said.  The federal government spent $15.1 billion on the so-called
War on Drugs in 2010, according to the  Office of National Drug
Control Policy . Efforts to combat illegal drug use included
prevention, treatment,  law enforcement  and interdiction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
