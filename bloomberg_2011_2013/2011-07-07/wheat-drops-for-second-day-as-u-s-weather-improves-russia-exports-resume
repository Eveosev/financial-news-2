Wheat declined for a second day as
weather conditions improved in growing areas including the U.S.
and as  Russia  was set to return to the export market, increasing
supplies. Rice futures advanced.
　　Warm temperatures and showers were forecast in the Dakotas
and northern  Minnesota , benefiting spring wheat and corn crops,
while scattered rains and cooler temperatures in Western Europe
may aid winter-wheat crop development, Telvent DTN Inc. said in
a forecast yesterday.  Egypt  said it plans to buy at least 55,000
metric tons of the grain, and Russia was added as an approved
source.
　　“Cheap Russian wheat may be playing a bigger role” in
global prices, said Erin FitzPatrick, an analyst at Rabobank
International in London. “Egypt’s tender included Russia this
time.”
　　September-delivery wheat fell 7.75 cents, or 1.2 percent, to
$6.1925 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 10:49 a.m.
 London  time, extending yesterday’s 1.3 percent slide. Milling
wheat for November delivery on the NYSE Liffe exchange in Paris
fell 4 euros, or 2.1 percent, to 190.50 euros ($272.46) a ton.
　　Exports of all grains from Russia’s southern Black Sea port
of Novorossiysk will probably reach more than 600,000 tons this
month, Moscow-based researcher SovEcon said yesterday. Shipments
resume this month as the government ends a ban on exports first
implemented in August last year, after the nation had the worst
drought in at least half a century.
　　The  United Nations ’ Food and Agriculture Organization today
raised its wheat-production forecast 0.7 percent from a June 22
estimate to 675.6 million tons.  Rice Gains  　　Corn for December delivery was little changed at $6.0775 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade, after losing as much as
0.5 percent. The price has dropped in five of the past six
sessions. Soybeans for November delivery also was little changed
at $13.20 a bushel.
　　Rice futures gained 36.5 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.935
per 100 pounds in Chicago, the fifth straight increase. Prices
have risen every session since the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  said on June 30 that growers in the country, the
third-biggest exporter of the grain, planted 2.67 million acres
with rice, down from 3.64 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story：
