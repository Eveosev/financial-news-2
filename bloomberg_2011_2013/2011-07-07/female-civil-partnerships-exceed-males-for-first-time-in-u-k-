The number of civil partnerships in
the U.K. increased 1.7 percent last year, according to
 provisional data  from the  Office for National Statistics , with
female partnerships overtaking male couples for the first time.  The total number of civil partnerships was 6,385, with
females accounting for 51 percent, the ONS said in a statement
on its website today. This change had already taken place in
Scotland and  Wales  in 2007, and  Northern Ireland  in 2009, the
ONS said.  Civil partnerships have been carried out in the U.K. since
December 2005, enabling same-sex couples to enter into
agreements giving them similar rights to married couples. This
February, the government said it would allow same-sex couples to
register civil partnerships in places of worship in England and
Wales, and would consult on legislation to remove other
differences and give equal status to civil marriages and civil
partnerships.  Civil partnership dissolutions increased 44 percent to 509
last year, according to the ONS data. The increase in the
dissolution rate was “to be expected as the number of civil
partners living in the U.K. continues to increase,” the ONS
said.  Since 2005, a total of 46,622 civil partnerships have been
formed. The highest number of civil partnerships was recorded in
the first quarter of 2006, at 4,869, as many long-term couples
took advantage of the change of legislation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
