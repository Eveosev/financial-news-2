Sudan ’s Southern Kordofan state
remains “tense” and “volatile” as fighting between
government forces and units of Southern Sudan’s army continued
through July 5, the  United Nations  said today.  Heavy gunfire and aerial bombardments took place around the
state capital, Kadugli, each day from June 30 to July 5, the UN
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in an
e-mailed report. It also said helicopter gunships “engaged in
offensive air operations” west of Kadugli on July 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
