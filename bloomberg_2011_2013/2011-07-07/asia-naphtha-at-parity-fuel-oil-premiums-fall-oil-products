Naphtha for first-half September
delivery traded at parity to second-half September cargoes from
backwardation yesterday. Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd.
bought  fuel oil  at the smallest premium since May. Hin Leong
Trading Pte purchased gasoil for a second day in Singapore.  Light Distillates  Naphtha for delivery to  Japan  traded at $960 a metric ton,
according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring
transactions on the Platts window. Yesterday, cargoes traded
lower at $945.50 to $946 a ton.  Cargoes for the first half of September were at parity to
second-half September cargoes. Glencore International AG sold
25,000 tons to Royal Dutch Shell Plc, while Mabanaft Gmbh & Co.
sold 25,000 tons to Cargill Inc.  First-half September cargoes traded 50 cents higher than
second-half September cargoes on the Platts window yesterday,
the first time in a month that the market was trading in
backwardation, a situation where prompt cargoes were more
expensive than later cargoes.  Shell also bought 50,000 barrels of 97-RON gasoline at
$129.30 a barrel from Trafigura, the survey showed. Yesterday,
Shell bought a similar cargo from Vitol at $129.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $97.08 a ton at 5:45 p.m.  Singapore  time from $94.46 at the
end of Asian trading yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Fuel Oil  Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd. sold 21,000 tons of 180-
centistoke fuel oil to BP Plc, bringing its sales so far this
month to 184,000 tons, according to the survey. The Hong Kong
company received $2.50 a ton over benchmark quotes, the smallest
premium since May 13.  Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 6 cents to
$7.60 a barrel at 2:29 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
The difference shrank for a second day, indicating reduced
losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade declined 25 cents to $10.50. A narrower viscosity spread
means bunker, or marine fuel, has increased more than higher-
quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong Trading Pte bought two cargoes of 0.5 percent
sulfur gasoil, or diesel, the survey showed. The Singapore
company paid 30 cents a barrel below benchmark quotes to Vitol
Group and 35 cents below second-half July quotes to BP. Shell
sold to Glencore International AG at a 40-cent discount and
Singapore Petroleum Co. sold to China International United
Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Unipec, at minus 35 cents.  PetroChina Co. sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with 10
parts-per-million of sulfur to BP at $2 a barrel over July
quotes, the survey showed. BP last month was the second-largest
buyer of so-called ultra-low-sulfur diesel in Singapore.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude added 3
cents to $17.86 a barrel at 2:29 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This crack spread, a measure of
refining profit, gained for a second day.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after rising 5
cents yesterday to $1.05 a barrel, PVM said. This regrade was at
the widest in a week, signaling it’s profitable to produce
 aviation fuel .  BP bought 100,000 barrels of jet fuel from Glencore at 50
cents a barrel below benchmark quotes, the survey showed. That’s
the same discount as the previous reported transaction July 5.  To contact the reporters on this story:
