The Dutch government completed the
sale of more than three-quarters of its allocation of oil under
the  International Energy Agency ’s inventory-release program.  About 450,000 barrels of  Brent crude  was sold in a tender
today, said Ted Van Dam Merrett, managing director at the
National Petroleum Stockpiling Agency, or COVA. A private buyer
bought the same volume of Forties crude and condensate, he said.
Condensate is a hydrocarbon similar to light crude, often found
in natural gas fields.  The Netherlands is one of 12 countries participating in the
release of 60 million barrels of crude and oil products
announced by the IEA last month. Of that, Dutch authorities were
allocated 1.173 million barrels.  COVA issued a second tender for 150,000 barrels of diesel,
Van Dam Merrett said by phone from Rotterdam. The rest of the
country’s oil allocation will be sold privately, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
