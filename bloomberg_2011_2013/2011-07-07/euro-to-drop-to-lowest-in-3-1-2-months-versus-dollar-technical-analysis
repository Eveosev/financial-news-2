The euro may fall to a 3 1/2-month
low against the dollar should it drop below the 100-day moving
average of $1.4273, said Timothy Riddell, head of  technical
analysis  at ANZ Banking Group Ltd.  The 17-nation currency formed a “consolidation” pattern
this week, according to Riddell. The formation is created by an
ascending trend line connecting the lows of May 23, June 16 and
June 27 and a descending trend line linking the highs of June 7
and July 4, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The whole pattern since May 23 is a consolidation that I
consider completed on July 4, skewing the risks now to another
down leg of similar proportion to that which we saw in early
May,” Singapore-based Riddell said in an interview.  The euro traded at $1.4359 as of 7:47 a.m. in  Tokyo  from
$1.4364 in  New York  yesterday, when it touched $1.4221, the
lowest level since June 27.  Should the euro drop below the 100-day moving average, the
currency will probably approach the June 16 low of $1.4074 and
possibly extend losses toward $1.3903, the 50 percent Fibonacci
retracement of this year’s rally to $1.4940 from $1.2867,
Riddell said. The $1.3903 level was last seen on March 17.  Fibonacci analysis is based on a theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break above resistance, or below support, indicates it may move
to the next level. Support refers to an areas where buy orders
may clustered. Resistance is where there may be orders to sell.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
