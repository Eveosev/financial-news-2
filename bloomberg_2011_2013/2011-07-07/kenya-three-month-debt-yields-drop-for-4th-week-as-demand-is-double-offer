Kenya ’s three-month borrowing costs
fell for the fourth successive weekly auction as investors bid
for double the amount of bills the central bank offered.  The yield on 91-day Treasury bills declined to 8.954
percent at today’s sale from 8.98 percent on June 30, the
Nairobi-based Central Bank of Kenya said in an e-mailed
statement. The bank issued 4.08 billion shillings ($45 million)
of debt after investors bid for 4.13 billion shillings of the 2
billion shillings offered.  The Kenyan government has kept borrowing costs from rising
at its weekly auctions by limiting its issue of debt to
investors willing to accept the lowest yields compared with
rivals. The strategy was adopted after three-month bill yields
surged to a more than nine-year high as inflation accelerated to
the strongest in more than two years and the shilling weakened
to a 17-year low.  “The central bank is looking at capping the rate to ensure
the short-term securities do not distort the yield curve, which
in turn will push up the yields on the long-term securities,”
Dipna Shah, an investment analyst at Nairobi-based PineBridge
Investments East Africa Ltd., said in an interview today before
the auction.  The central bank increased the overnight lending rate to 8
percent from 6.25 percent to rein in price growth and curb
speculation in the shilling, it said on June 29.  Kenya will boost spending by 15 percent to 1.15 trillion
shillings in the year through June 2012, increasing investments
in roads and energy, Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said in his
budget speech on June 8. The deficit excluding grants in East
Africa’s biggest economy will widen to 8.8 percent of gross
domestic product in 2011-12 from 8.4 percent a year earlier.
Domestic borrowing is targeted at 119.5 billion shillings in the
next financial year, down from 125 billion shillings this year.  Kenya’s monetary policy committee raised the benchmark
interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 6.25 percent and
the  cash reserve ratio  by a quarter of a percentage point to
4.75 percent, central bank said on May 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
