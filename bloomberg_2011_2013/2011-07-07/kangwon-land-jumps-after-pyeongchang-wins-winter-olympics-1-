Kangwon Land Inc. (035250) , a South Korean
casino and hotels operator, surged in Seoul trading after the
2018 Winter Olympics were awarded to a town in the province
where the company is based.  Stocks of construction, cement, resort and design companies
also rose on the Korea Exchange after Pyeongchang, in the
Taebaek mountains about 130 kilometers (80 miles) east of Seoul,
beat Munich and  France ’s Annecy to host the Games.  Kangwon Land, which also has a ski resort and golf course,
rallied as much as 9.5 percent before trading 3.1 percent higher
at 30,000 won as of 10:19 a.m. in Seoul.  The Winter Olympics will make it easier for Kangwon Land,
an importance source of  tax revenue  for Gangwon province, to
expand in the region, according to Shinhan Investment Corp.
Expected investments in transportation infrastructure will also
improve access to Kangwon Land’s facilities, the brokerage said
in a report today.  “The event will help the company attract more visitors and
therefore boost sales,” Sung June Won, a Shinhan analyst, wrote
in the report.  Hosting the 2018 Winter Olympics will directly add 21.1
trillion won ($19.8 billion) to the South Korean economy,
Hyundai Research Institute said in a report published this week.
Benefits from increased tourism and raising the profile of the
nation and its corporate brands will indirectly add a further
43.8 trillion won to the economy in the 10 years after the
Olympics, according to the report.  Builders Rise  Stocks of South Korean builders also advanced on
speculation the sporting event will help boost domestic orders.  Hyundai Engineering & Construction Co. rose 2.3 percent,  GS
Engineering & Construction Corp. (006360)  gained 2.7 percent and  Samsung
C&T Corp. (000830)  climbed 2.3 percent.  “Contracts for infrastructure and stadiums will come,
which should be positive for builders whose domestic orders have
been a bit lackluster,” Han Jong Hyo, an analyst with Shinyoung
Securities Co., said by phone today.  Heerim Architects & Planners (037440) , which won a contract to
design a stadium for the 2014 Incheon Asian Games, rose 1.3
percent, while Freedom Travel Co., which is building a resort in
Pyeongchang, added 4.9 percent.  Hyundai Cement Co., which has operations including a ski
resort in Gangwon province, surged by the daily limit of 15
