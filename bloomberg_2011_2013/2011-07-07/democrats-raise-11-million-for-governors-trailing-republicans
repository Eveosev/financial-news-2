The Democratic Governors Association
raised $11 million for state campaigns during the first six
months of 2011, lagging behind that collected by Republicans,
who control a majority of U.S. governorships.  The Washington-based Democrats  said today  that the amount
raised was more than double the $5.38 million of the first six
months of 2007, a similar stage in the electoral cycle. At that
time, when Democrats controlled 28 states, the  Republican
Governors Association  raised more than twice as much.  The Democrats’ collections this year are half the $22.1
million the Republican group said this week it raised in the
same period. Republican governors serve in 29 states after
November’s election, when the party also won control of the U.S.
House of Representatives.  This year, governor  elections will be held  in West
Virginia, Mississippi,  Louisiana  and Kentucky, which are
currently divided between the two parties.  The Democrats said the fundraising left $8.6 million on
hand and that polls suggest their candidates are positioned to
hold Kentucky and West Virginia.  “We will have the resources to win our competitive races
in 2011 and lay the groundwork for 2012,” Maryland Governor
Martin O’Malley, head of the Democratic group, said in a
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
