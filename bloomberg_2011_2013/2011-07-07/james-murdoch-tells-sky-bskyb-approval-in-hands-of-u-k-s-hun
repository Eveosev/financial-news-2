News Corp. (NWSA)  Deputy Chief Operating
Officer  James Murdoch  told Sky News in an interview the decision
on whether News Corp. is permitted to take over British Sky
Broadcasting Group Plc is “in the hands of” Culture Secretary
 Jeremy Hunt .  Murdoch was asked whether News of the World hacking
allegations have damaged News Corp.’s chances of getting
approval for the BSkyB deal.  “It does take time to deal with those sorts of things, but
that timetable is in the hands of the Secretary of State,”
Murdoch said.  Murdoch said with regard to the phone hacking
investigations he is “absolutely committed to doing the right
thing” and will cooperate “fully” with police investigations
into phone hacking activities at the News of the World.  Murdoch is “satisfied” with News International Chief
Executive Officer Rebekah Brooks’s “ethics” and “conduct,”
and “that she neither had knowledge of nor directed those
activities,” he told Sky News.  News of the World staff were told that Brooks offered her
resignation last night, Sky News said, citing unidentified
people with knowledge of the matter. Her resignation was
refused, Sky said, citing the people.  A message left on the voicemail of News International
spokeswoman Daisy Dunlop outside office hours wasn’t immediately
returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
