About 98 percent of German banks
expect their business to develop positively in the next six
months as the country’s economic growth offsets the debt crisis
in southern  Europe , according to an Ernst & Young survey.  About 22 percent of the 120 German lenders surveyed also
regard the current business situation as “very positive” while
76 percent find it “satisfactory,” Ernst & Young said in an e-
mailed statement today. A positive development in capital
markets is forecast by 41 percent of the banks while 17 percent
expect deterioration, the survey showed.  European Union leaders are insisting banks and insurance
companies contribute to a new aid package for Greece after last
year’s 110 billion-euro ($157 billion) rescue failed to stop the
spread of the region’s debt crisis. Moody’s Investors Service
has downgraded both Greece and  Portugal ’s credit ratings to junk
amid concern they may not be able to reach the EU bailout terms.  The German economy grew 1.5 percent in the first quarter as
companies boosted spending to meet increased export demand and
construction rebounded from a slump in the previous three
months. The German central bank forecasts that the economy will
grow 3.1 percent this year while countries from  Greece  to
Portugal are struggling amid a debt crisis that’s shaking the
foundations of the euro currency.  About 25 percent of the surveyed banks expect to hire more
people in the coming six months, while 12 percent expect their
workforce to decline, Ernst & Young said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
