John Paulson  lost 11 percent in his
biggest fund in June, according to an investor, as the firm sold
off  Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE)  after a short-seller’s allegations.  The drop left Paulson’s Advantage Plus Fund, which uses
strategies designed to profit from corporate events such as
takeovers and bankruptcies, down 18 percent this year, said the
client, who asked not to be named because the information is
private. The fund’s gold-denominated share class declined 11
percent in June and 12 percent in 2011.  Paulson & Co., which manages $37 billion overall, posted
declines across all of its strategies in June, as the firm sold
its shares of Sino-Forest, the Chinese forestry company accused
of overstating timberland holdings and production in the Yunnan
province, at a C$462 million ($482 million) loss since May 31,
and global stocks and gold fell.  Paulson, 55, has been betting on an economic recovery by
2012. He lost 11 percent last year through August with his $9
billion flagship fund before performance picked up and returns
turned positive as of mid-December. The fund declined 4.4
percent in March to erase this year’s early gains, was little
changed in April and slumped 6 percent in May.  Sino-Forest, which the New York-based firm held in its
Advantage funds, has plunged about 73 percent from its closing
price on June 1, the day before Carson Block’s Muddy Waters LLC
issued its report targeting the stock. Paulson & Co. sold the
entire stake in Sino-Forest, which is based in  Hong Kong  and
Mississauga, Ontario, as of June 17.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for Paulson, declined to comment.  Recovery Fund  Paulson’s dollar-denominated Advantage Fund, which employs
a similar strategy to Advantage Plus, dropped 7.3 percent last
month and 12 percent this year. The gold share class lost 8.1
percent in June and declined 7 percent in 2011.  Investors can choose between dollar- and gold-denominated
versions for most of Paulson & Co.’s funds.  The Recovery Fund, which invests in assets Paulson believes
will benefit from a long-term economic recovery, declined 3.6
percent last month and increased 1.2 percent this year. Its gold
share class lost 5.2 percent in June and gained 3.4 percent this
year.  The firm’s Gold Fund, which can buy derivatives and other
gold-related investments, fell 8.6 percent in June, leaving it
down 7.9 percent for the year.  The Paulson Partners Enhanced Fund, which invests in the
shares of merging companies, decreased 4.7 percent last month
and gained 6.1 percent in 2011. The gold share class declined
5.8 percent in June and advanced 8.9 percent this year.  Paulson’s Credit Opportunities Fund declined 2.7 percent
last month and climbed 5 percent in 2011. Its gold shares lost
3.9 percent in June and gained 7.9 percent this year.  Hedge funds  fell 0.2 percent in June as stocks slumped amid
rising concern  Greece  would default on its debt and evidence the
global economy was slowing, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
