Russia’s State Duma approved tax
discounts for small oilfields as the world’s largest crude-
producing nation seeks to spur output from companies including
Petroneft Plc,  Volga Gas Plc (VGAS)  and  Exillon Energy Plc. (EXI)   The lower house passed the measure “in the first days of
July,” Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Shatalov said in an
interview today in Moscow. President Dmitry Medvedev will have
to sign the proposal for it to come into force, he said.  The discounts would lower extraction taxes by as much as 50
percent at oilfields with less than 5 million metric tons (about
37 million barrels) of reserves. Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  has called on producers to maintain output at more than 10
million barrels a day for at least a decade to bolster revenues
even as older deposits go into decline.  Russia  may have 1 billion tons of oil spread over thousands
of small deposits, Shatalov said in March. That’s equivalent to
almost 9.5 percent of Russia’s proven reserves, according to BP
Plc data. Petroneft, Volga Gas and Exillon have all raised funds
on London’s Stock Exchange to exploit smaller fields often
overlooked by Russia’s largest producers.  Russia’s proven oil reserves totaled 77.4 billion barrels
at the end of last year, according to BP data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
