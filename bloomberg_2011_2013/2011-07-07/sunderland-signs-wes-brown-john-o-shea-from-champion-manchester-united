Sunderland signed Manchester United
defenders Wes Brown and John O’Shea to four-year contracts.  The Premier League club didn’t disclose financial terms of
either signing in  statements  on its website. Media reports said
the Black Cats last month had a joint bid of more than 12
million pounds ($19 million) accepted for Brown, O’Shea and
midfielder Darron Gibson, who is currently still with league
champion United.  The duo become the seventh and eighth signings by
Sunderland manager  Steve Bruce  this offseason after Keiren
Westwood, Sebastian Larsson, Ji Dong-won,  Craig Gardner , Connor
Wickham and Ahmed Elmohamady.  To contact the reporter on this story:
