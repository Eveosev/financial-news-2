Clipper Group A/S, a closely-held
shipping company, said a tax probe that has led to jail
sentences and fines for 94 present and former employees has no
impact on the company because it’s matter between the workers
and Danish authorities.  “We as a company have done nothing wrong,” Chief
Executive Officer Per Gullestrup said today via telephone from
Copenhagen. “It’s an unfortunate situation for the employees in
question and I can’t speculate as to why some didn’t pay their
taxes. This will have no effect on our operations.”  The company had paid bonuses to employees from its Bahamas
office from the late 1990s to 2007, instructing Danish-based
workers each year that they were obligated to report the income
to  Denmark ’s tax authority, Gullestrup said. A Danish court
handed jail sentences to four current and former employees and
fined another 90 for not reporting the income, Copenhagen-based
broadcaster DR said earlier this week.  “None of the people who received jail sentences held high-
ranking positions at Clipper,” Gullestrup said. Clipper doesn’t
plan any sanctions against the employees whom the court found
guilty, he said. “When they have settled the matter with the
authorities, they are welcome to work at Clipper.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
