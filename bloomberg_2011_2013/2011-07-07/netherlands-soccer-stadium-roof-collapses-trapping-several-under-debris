One person died and 10 others were
hospitalized after part of the stadium of soccer club  FC Twente 
in the city of Enschede collapsed today during construction.  “Two people are seriously injured,” Peter den Oudsten,
the mayor of the eastern city, told a news conference. “Dogs
and cameras are being used to search for possible victims below
the collapsed roof.”  The  Grolsch Veste  stadium in Enschede is being expanded to
hold 30,000 people, according to the club’s website. The roof of
one of the stands came down at noon, Den Oudsten said, adding
that it’s too early to say what caused the collapse. Another
three people were treated at the site.  Construction workers ran for their lives as the roof, on
which other people were working, fell, eyewitnesses told the
Dutch ANP newswire. About 10 fire trucks, 20 to 25 ambulances
and a rescue helicopter were at the stadium, it said.  FC Twente  was runner-up to Amsterdam’s AFC Ajax in the
Dutch soccer league last season. The stadium, which was
previously named the Arke Stadion, dates from 1998. The works
were in their final phase, FC Twente commercial director Jan van
Halst told the news conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
