Airbus SAS delivered more airliners
and won more orders in the first half of the year than in 2010,
keeping its lead over  Boeing Co. (BA)   Airbus, which has produced the most commercial planes every
year since 2003, said today it handed over 258 jets to customers
this year through June. That’s eight more than the Toulouse,
France-based company delivered in the first six months of 2010.
Chicago-based Boeing said it delivered 222 aircraft, unchanged
from a year earlier.  Airbus said it secured  640 new orders  in the first half
after stripping out 137 cancellations. Boeing’s  net orders  fell
to 171, from 177 a year ago, after  Etihad Airways , Air Pacific
and Gulf Air canceled contracts for 20 of the 787 Dreamliners.
Both planemakers have said they are boosting production this
year to work off record order backlogs.  Airbus has racked up orders since its December decision to
offer the A320neo, a new version of its popular narrow-body jet
sporting improved engines that’s due in 2015. Boeing hasn’t
decided whether to follow suit with similar changes to its best-
selling 737 or to develop an all-new single-aisle jet at the end
of the decade.  Boeing said last year that it aimed to reclaim the position
of world’s largest planemaker from its European rival this year,
as its new, delayed 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 jumbo jet enter
service. Both planes are scheduled to be delivered to their
first customers by September.  Boeing expects to deliver 485 to 500 aircraft this year, up
from 462 last year. The company shipped 118 planes in the second
quarter, four more than a year ago, making up for fewer
deliveries in the first quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
