German wage growth is accelerating,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing figures published by the
Wiesbaden-based Federal Statistics Office and the labor union-
affiliated WSI economic institute.  Wages, adjusted for inflation, grew 2 percent in the first
quarter compared with the same year-earlier period in inflation
adjusted terms, the second-fastest pace of expansion in three
years, the newspaper cited the office as saying.  The rise in pay contract wages, which exclude items such as
overtime bonuses, averaged 2.3 percent so far this year,
unadjusted for inflation, the newspaper cited the WSI as saying.
That’s an increase of 0.5 percentage points from the 2010
average, it said.  Pay contract compensation may rise at a faster pace next
year, when wages for engineering and chemical industry workers
are due for negotiation, the newspaper cited WSI economist
Reinhard Bispinck as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
