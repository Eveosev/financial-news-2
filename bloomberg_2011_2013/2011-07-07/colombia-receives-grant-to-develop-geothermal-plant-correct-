(Corrects spelling of  Colombia  in headline and first
paragraph.)  The Global Environment Facility, a
Washington-based agency that funds development projects focused
on renewable energy and climate change, offered a $2.7 million
grant to Colombia to build its first geothermal power plant.  The funds will be used to assess the geothermal potential
at Macizo Volcanico del Ruiz, a volcanic massif in Colombiaâ€™s
central mountain range, the Washington-based  Inter-American
Development Bank , which will administer the grant, said on its
website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
