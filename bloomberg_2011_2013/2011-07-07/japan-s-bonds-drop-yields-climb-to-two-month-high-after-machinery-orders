Japanese bonds declined, pushing
yields on 10- and 30-year debt to the highest level in two
months, after a government report showed machinery orders
rebounded in May.  Thirty-year bonds fell for a seventh session as economists
said a U.S. industry report today will show employers stepped up
hiring last month, a sign global growth is gaining momentum.
Debt also fell amid speculation  Japan  will need to issue more
bonds to fund reconstruction from its March earthquake. Losses
were tempered after demand increased at a 700 billion yen ($8.65
billion) auction of 30-year securities.  “Bonds are being sold as the pessimistic view about the
domestic and overseas economies is receding,” said  Satoshi Yamada , who helps oversee about $12 billion as manager of fixed-
income trading at Okasan Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Demand
is still solid for longer-term debt with life insurers buying
them even as there’s concern about Japan’s finance.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bond rose one basis
points to 1.175 percent as of 2:21 p.m. at Japan Bond Trading
Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. The 1.2
percent security due June 2021 dropped 0.089 yen to 100.222 yen.
The yield earlier reached 1.18 percent, the most since May 2.  Thirty-year yields climbed one basis point to 2.095 percent,
the highest since May 6. Ten-year bond futures for September
delivery gained 0.02 to 140.62 on the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange.   Japanese factory orders, an indicator of business
investment in three to six months, rose 3 percent, following a
3.3 percent decline in April, the Cabinet Office said in Tokyo.
U.S. employers added 70,000 workers last month after hiring
38,000 in May, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News before today’s report from ADP Employer Services.  Spread Widens  The spread between 10- and 30-year yields widened to the
most in three weeks after Prime Minister  Naoto Kan  said
yesterday a “considerable” amount of  government bonds  will
need to be issued to fund rebuilding from the March 11
earthquake and tsunami.  The difference in yield expanded to 92 basis points, the
widest level since June 13.  Today’s 30-year auction drew bids for 3.75 times the amount
on offer, compared with a so-called bid-to-cover ratio of 3.16
at the previous sale on June 7. The lowest price was 101.80,
matching the prediction of 13 traders in a Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
