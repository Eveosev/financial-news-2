William Lynn, deputy U.S. defense
secretary, will step down once a successor is in place this
fall, the Pentagon announced, signaling more changes to
President Barack Obama’s national security team.  Lynn, 57, met with Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  last week
to discuss his plans to return to private life, according to a
news release. Panetta, former director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, was sworn in as defense secretary on July
1.  “I will rely on his experience and expertise during this
transition period,” Panetta said in the release. “His service
will be greatly missed.”  Panetta succeeded  Robert Gates , a holdover from President
George W. Bush’s administration, who retired.  Lynn in 2009 became the 30th deputy secretary of defense
and No. 2 at the Pentagon, where he helped craft a cybersecurity
strategy and oversaw the creation of  U.S. Cyber Command . He also
helped develop a space strategy that would change how the
government acquires and exports satellite technology amid
increasing global competition.  A former national security adviser to Senator Edward Kennedy, the  Massachusetts  Democrat who died two years ago, Lynn
was a senior adviser to five secretaries of defense and worked
as an executive at  Raytheon Co. (RTN) , of Waltham, Massachusetts, from
2002 to 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
