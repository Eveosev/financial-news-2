Hong Kong  Resources Holdings Co.
Chairman Wong Ying-ho and Executive Director Chui Chuen Shun are
assisting in an  Independent Commission Against Corruption 
investigation, according to a statement from the company.  The ICAC won’t confirm the investigation or comment further,
spokeswoman Cecily Chik said by phone today.  Trading in Hong Kong Resources shares was suspended July 4,
pending a price-sensitive announcement, the company said in a
filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange at the time.  “The company continues its daily operations as usual,”
Hong Kong Resources said in today’s statement. Wong and Chui
have resumed their duties and the probe has no connection with
the company or its business, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
