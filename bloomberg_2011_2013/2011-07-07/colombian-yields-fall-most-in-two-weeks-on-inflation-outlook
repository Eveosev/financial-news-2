Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to fall the most in two weeks, on bets lower food prices
will help ease inflation in the second half of the year.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 7.76 percent at
11:07 a.m. New York time, according to the stock exchange.
That’s its biggest decline since June 24. The bond’s price rose
0.511 centavo to 117.960 centavos per peso.  “From here to the rest of the year, food prices should
have small variations and therefore monthly inflation readings
should be lower,” said Camilo Contreras, an analyst at
Ultrabursatiles SA brokerage in Bogota. That should continue to
help the rally in longer-term bonds, he said.  Yields also fell after the  Finance Ministry  said in a
statement after the market closed yesterday that it will reduce
the amount of securities in its weekly debt auction to 350
billion pesos ($199 million) from 500 billion pesos starting
July 13, Contreras said. The government’s 2011 financing plan
remains unchanged, according to the statement.  “The announcement had a psychological impact on the market
because there is going to be less paper in the short term than
people were expecting,” Contreras said.  Colombia’s consumer prices rose 0.32 percent in June from
the previous month, driven by an increase in recreation, food
and housing prices, the national statistics agency said in a
July 5  report . That compares to monthly inflation of 0.28
percent in May, and to the median estimate for a 0.23 percent
increase in June in a Bloomberg survey of 27 economists.  The La Nina weather pattern that triggered storms and
floods, choking off farmers’ supply routes and driving up food
costs, ended in May, according to the Institute of Hydrology,
Meteorology and Environmental Studies, known as IDEAM.  The peso gained 0.4 percent to 1,759.05 per dollar, from
1,766.18 yesterday. It has jumped 3.8 percent in the past three
months, the best performance among 25 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
