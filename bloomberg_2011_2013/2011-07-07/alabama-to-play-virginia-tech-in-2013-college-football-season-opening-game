The University of  Alabama  will face
Virginia Tech to begin the 2013 college football season.  The  Crimson Tide  and the  Hokies , who first faced each other
in 1932, will play in the  Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game  at the
Georgia Dome in Atlanta. It will mark the third time Alabama,
which went on to win college football’s national title after
defeating Virginia Tech in the 2009 season-opener, will play in
the game. Alabama beat Clemson in the 2008 contest.  Alabama leads the series between the two schools 11-1.  The game, which will be televised on either  Walt Disney
Co. (DIS) ’s ABC or ESPN networks, will take place the same weekend as
the planned opening of college football’s hall of fame adjacent
to the  Georgia Dome . The date of the kickoff game has yet to be
decided, Matt Garvey, a spokesman for the game, said in an e-
mail. It’s traditionally played on Saturday of Labor Day
weekend, which is Aug. 31 in 2013.  This year’s kickoff game will feature Boise State against
 Georgia  on Sept. 3 at the Georgia Dome.  To contact the reporter on this story:
