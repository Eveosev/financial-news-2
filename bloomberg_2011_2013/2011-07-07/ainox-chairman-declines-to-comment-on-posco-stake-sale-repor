Thainox Stainless Pcl (INOX)  Chairman
Prayudh Mahagitsiri declined to comment on a Thai News Agency
report that his family plans to sell their 57 percent stake in
the stainless-steel producer to  South Korea â€™s  Posco. (005490)   Prayudh has agreed to sell the stake for 2.20 baht per
share, Thai News reported on its website, without saying where
it obtained the information. Posco, which already owns 15
percent of Bangkok-based Thainox, will probably make a tender
offer for the remaining shares in the company, the report said.  Prayudh and Posco spokesman Chung Jae Woong declined to
comment on the report.  Thainox asked the Thai exchange to halt trading of its
shares until 12:30 p.m. today, according to a regulatory
statement. The stock has gained 31 percent in the past five
trading days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
