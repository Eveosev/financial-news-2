German 10-year government bonds
declined after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude
Trichet said the ECB will suspend collateral rules for  Portugal .  The yield on the 10-year bund was three basis points higher
at 2.96 percent as of 1:56 p.m. in  London . Two-year yields pared
their decline, and were little changed at 1.58 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
