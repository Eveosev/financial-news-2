U.S. stocks jumped, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index close to a three-year high, as
retail and job market data bolstered confidence in the economy.  Target Corp. (TGT) , the second-largest U.S. discount retailer,
and  Kohl’s Corp. (KSS)  rose at least 6.6 percent as June retail sales
surpassed analysts’ projections.  Urban Outfitters Inc. (URBN)  rallied 6
percent after Morgan Stanley recommended investors buy the
shares.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  climbed 1.9 percent as banking
shares soared.  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  climbed 1.1 percent to 1,353.22 at 4 p.m.
in  New York , its highest closing level since May 10. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  rose 93.47 points, or 0.7 percent, to
12,719.49, as a report by ADP Employer Services showed U.S.
companies added more jobs than forecast in June. Volume on U.S.
exchanges totaled about 6.8 billion at 4:30 p.m., 4 percent less
than the three-month average through yesterday.  “We’re starting to cycle through the list of issues that
have been on investors’ minds,” said Christopher Blum, New
York-based chief investment officer for the U.S. behavioral
finance group at JPMorgan Asset Management, which oversees $1.9
trillion in assets. “Economic data is coming in better than
expected, and certainly the beat on the jobs number today came
earlier than most investors had expected.”  The  S&P 500  has climbed 6.7 percent over the past eight
days, with last week’s gain the biggest since July 2009. The
index is about 10 points shy of a three-year high reached April
29. Through June 24, U.S. equities had fallen for seven of the
previous eight weeks on concern that the European debt crisis
would spread and the  U.S. economy  slow. The index still has
gained 7.6 percent for the year amid better-than-expected
earnings and government stimulus measures.  Job Reports  Equities rose today as figures from ADP showed companies in
the U.S. added 157,000 workers to their payrolls in June. The
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called
for an advance of 70,000. The data comes before the government’s
June payrolls report tomorrow.  Separate data from the Labor Department showed jobless
claims fell by 14,000 to 418,000 last week, compared with the
median forecast of economists for a drop to 420,000. The number
of people on unemployment benefit rolls and those getting
extended payments also declined.  “These kind of employment numbers are supportive for the
market,” said  Lawrence Creatura , a Rochester, New York-based
fund manager at Federated Investors Inc., which oversees about
$355 billion. “Unemployment is the single most dominant
statistic in our national debate right now, it shadows all the
other economic and political debates and it shapes the sentiment
which surrounds the stock market.”  Commodity Producers  Measures of fuel and materials companies climbed 1.4
percent and 1.5 percent, respectively, while the Morgan Stanley
Cyclical Index added 1.3 percent on speculation that the U.S.
labor market may be stronger, indicating that job growth could
accelerate in the second half of the year and demand for
commodities will improve.  Investors next week also will be turning their attention to
second-quarter earnings. The season starts July 11 with Alcoa
Inc., the first Dow company to release results. Corporate
earnings are forecast to have grown by 13 percent, according to
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Retailers in the S&P 500 rallied 2.4 percent today to a
record. Sales reports indicated that shoppers took advantage of
discounts that retailers implemented in June to clear out
inventory and make room for back-to-school merchandise. Lower
gas prices and warmer temperatures also enticed consumers. Gas
prices in the U.S. have declined 10 percent since a high of
$3.99 a gallon on May 4, according to AAA.  Retailers Surge  Target jumped 6.7 percent to $51.67 while Kohl’s, the
department-store chain that’s been in business since 1962,
soared 7.1 percent to $55.78.  Limited Brands Inc., operator of the Victoria’s Secret
chain, rose 2.7 percent to $40.36 after posting a gain of 12
percent in same-store sales for June, surpassing the 4.4 percent
average of analysts’ estimates compiled by Retail Metrics Inc.  Urban Outfitters, a clothing retailer, climbed 6 percent to
$32.58 after Morgan Stanley raised the stock to “overweight”
from “equal weight.”  Financial companies rose 1.6 percent, the biggest gain
among 10 groups in the S&P 500. JPMorgan climbed 1.9 percent to
$41.32, for the third-largest increase in the Dow.  Wells Fargo &
Co. (WFC)  added 1.9 percent to $28.66,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  advanced 1.5
percent to $42.63 and Bank of America Corp. jumped 1.7 percent
to $10.92.  Faulty Foreclosures  Bank of America, JPMorgan and three other U.S. mortgage
servicers are in advanced talks to resolve state and federal
claims over faulty foreclosures, according to two people briefed
on the matter. Negotiators tentatively set a July 13 target for
a settlement, which may exceed $20 billion, the people said.  The New York Post sent bank stocks lower yesterday after
reporting that the settlement’s total value might reach $60
billion, citing unidentified people close to the discussions.
The Post corrected its report today, saying the amount might
reach $25 billion.  Seagate Technology Plc (STX)  rose 2 percent to $16.64. The
world’s largest maker of computer disk drives was raised to
“overweight” from “underweight” at JPMorgan.  Affymetrix Inc. (AFFX)  tumbled 18 percent to $6.59. The producer
of genomic-analysis technology forecast second-quarter sales of
as little as $64 million, compared with the average analyst
estimate of $74.7 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
