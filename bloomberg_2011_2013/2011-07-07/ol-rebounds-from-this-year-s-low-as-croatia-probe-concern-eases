Mol Nyrt. gained from its lowest this
year as concern eased that the chairman of  Hungary ’s largest oil
refiner will be extradited to Croatia to face an investigation.  The stock gained 2.2 percent to 20,335 forint by 1:16 p.m.
in Budapest. It tumbled 4.8 percent in the previous two sessions
to Mol’s lowest since December after Croatia requested Hungary’s
legal assistance in a probe into the company’s Croatian unit,
INA Industrija Nafte d.d.  Croatia’s prosecutor general yesterday denied a newspaper
report that the country had requested the extradition of Zsolt
Hernadi. Mol’s selloff pushed the shares’ 14-day relative
strength index to 27 yesterday. A reading below the 30 level
indicates to technical analysts a security may rebound.  “The denial of a report on Hernadi’s extradition to
 Croatia  eased the pressure on Mol shares,” Peter Csaszar, an
analyst at KBC Securities in Warsaw, said by phone. “After the
steep decline in the stock of recent days, the current price
could be an attractive entry level for some investors.”  The RSI for Mol last stood at 34.  To contact the reporters on this story:
