Localiza Rent a Car SA (RENT3) ,  Latin
America ’s biggest car-rental company, advanced the most in a
week in Sao Paulo after Bank of America Corp. boosted its
estimates for second-quarter sales.  Localiza gained 2.8 percent to 27.66 reais at 1:05 p.m. New
York time, the most intraday since June 28. The stock was
unchanged this year through yesterday, compared to a 9.7 percent
drop for the benchmark Bovespa index.  Bank of America raised its forecast for revenue growth in
the car-rental segment to 30 percent from 20 percent, and in the
fleet-management division to 24 percent from 21 percent,
according to a note to clients yesterday from analysts including
Sara Delfim. Localiza will release quarterly results on July 13,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Historically, Localiza outperforms the market a few days
before reporting earnings,” the analysts wrote. “Our estimates
could be conservative, especially for the car rental and fleet
divisions. Localiza should report strong earnings, likely
beating market expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
