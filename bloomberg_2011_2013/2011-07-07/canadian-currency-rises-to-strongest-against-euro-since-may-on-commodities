Canada ’s dollar strengthened against
the greenback and the euro to the highest levels in more than a
month after an ADP Employer Services report showed U.S.
companies added more jobs in June than forecast.  The Canadian dollar, also known as the loonie, rose against
all except two of its 16 most-traded peers, appreciating more
than 1 percent versus the yen after the  European Central Bank 
raised  interest rates  and as gains in copper and crude oil made
currencies linked to raw materials more attractive.  “The ADP number was surprisingly strong, and that has
helped the Canadian dollar,” said  Camilla Sutton , head of
currency strategy at Bank of Nova Scotia, in a telephone
interview from Toronto. “By default, what’s good for the  U.S.
economy  is good for Canada.”  The Canadian currency rose 0.7 percent to 95.87 cents per
 U.S. dollar  at 5:02 p.m. in Toronto. Earlier it touched 95.69,
the strongest since May 10. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0433.  The loonie gained 0.4 percent to C$1.3764 per euro. It rose
1.1 percent to 84.76 cents per yen -- having earlier touched
84.93, the strongest since May 19.  Job Trends  Companies in the U.S. added 157,000 workers to their
payrolls in June, according to ADP figures, more than double the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, which
called for gains of 70,000. The data comes before the
government’s June payrolls report tomorrow.  “Over the last week and a half we’ve seen a general
improvement in risk appetite,” said Adrian Schmidt, a currency
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in  London . “The bigger
questions are all about how risk performs in general, about how
equities perform in general, how commodities perform in general
following the U.S. numbers later in the week.”  Canada’s economy added 15,000 jobs in June, after boosting
payrolls by a net 22,300 positions in May and 58,300 in April,
according to the median forecast of 23 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg before Statistics Canada data tomorrow. The jobless
rate held at 7.4 percent, according to the survey.  Canada’s government bonds have returned 2.21 percent this
year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The
Canadian dollar has gained 4.1 percent against its U.S.
counterpart in the period.  Government Yields  Yields on two-year Government of Canada bonds rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percent, to 1.58 percent, pushing the
price of the 2 percent note due in August 2013 down 9 cents to
C$100.85.  The yield on the 10-year note climbed one basis point to
3.05 percent as the price of the 3.25 percent security maturing
in June 2021 declined 10 cents to C$101.67.  Canada’s new home price index rose 0.4 percent in May,
twice the pace estimated by analysts, based on gains in the
country’s two largest cities. The selling price of new dwellings
rose 0.9 percent in Toronto during the month, and by 0.5 percent
in Montreal,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa.  Economists predicted the overall index would rise 0.2
percent in May following April’s 0.3 percent gain, according to
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey with 10 responses.  Crude oil futures rose 1.9 percent to $98.49 a barrel in
 New York . Crude is Canada’s largest export. Copper for October
delivery jumped 2.3 percent to $9,737 a metric ton on the London
Metal Exchange. Canada derives about half its export revenue
from raw materials.  ECB Moves  European Central Bank Officials meeting in  Frankfurt  today
increased the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.5
percent, matching forecasts by all 55 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. That’s the highest since March 2009. The central
bank will raise borrowing costs further in October, according to
a separate survey.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  said he will ease
 Portugal ’s access to emergency funds as officials battle both
faster inflation and the debt crisis. The decision on Portugal
came after Moody’s Investors Service sparked a renewed selloff
in euro region bond markets after saying on July 5 the country
may need a second bailout package.  “We are long way away from a solution of any sort in
 Europe ,” Scotia Capital’s Sutton said. “In the near term,
authorities are telling us that they are going to do everything
to support things, and that’s provided some relief. However the
bigger, broader question of a solution is still many quarters
away, and is likely to be a difficult one.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
