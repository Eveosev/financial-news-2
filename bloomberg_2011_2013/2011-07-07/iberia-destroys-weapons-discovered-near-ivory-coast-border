Liberia’s police and the  United
Nations  destroyed weapons found last month near the country’s
border with  Ivory Coast , said Rose E. Stryker, deputy police
director for administration.  The arms, including machine guns and rifles, were put out
of action to ensure they didn’t end up on the streets of the
West African nation, she said yesterday at a UN Mission in
Liberia facility near the capital, Monrovia, where the
incineration took place.  To contact the reporter on this story:
