The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 12:04 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.1 percent to 13,857.40, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.1 percent to 1,676.12.  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA CB), owner of  Colombia ’s
biggest airline, rose the most since it began trading May 11 as
first-half passenger traffic rose 19.4 percent from a year ago,
and the company denied speculation that it may soon issue new
shares, according to regulatory filings. The stock rose 2.9
percent to 4,835 pesos after rising as much as 3.8 percent
earlier.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota (ETB)  SA, the
phone company serving Colombia’s capital, fell 2.4 percent, the
most intraday since June 15, to 735 pesos. The company will lose
value should the city decide not to sell a stake in the service
provider, Beatriz Arbelaez, Bogota’s former secretary of
finance, told RCN Radio. Arbelaez said she resigned because of
differences with acting Bogota Mayor Clara Lopez, who opposes
selling a stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
