Gold gained for a third day as
interest-rate increases spurred concern that the global economy
may slow and as the European sovereign debt crisis increased
demand for the metal as a haven.  Gold for immediate delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
$1,532.85 an ounce at 1:36 p.m. in  Singapore . The August-
delivery contract was 0.3 percent higher at $1,533.20 an ounce,
also up for a third day.  China  raised its benchmark interest rates yesterday for the
fifth time since October to tame inflation which accelerated to
the fastest pace since July 2008. The People’s Bank of China
raised benchmark deposit and lending rates by 25 basis points,
effective from today.  “The fact they keep raising rates is generating talk of a
slowdown, which ultimately adds to concerns in the market of a
global slowdown in economic activity,” said  Darren Heathcote ,
head of trading at Investec Bank (Australia) Ltd. “Gold is
again benefitting from that.”  The  European Central Bank  will also raise  interest rates 
today, increasing the benchmark by 25 basis points to 1.5
percent, when council members meet in Frankfurt, according to
all 55 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Sovereign Debt  Concern over  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis may also buoy
prices after Moody’s Investors Service cut Portugal to Ba2 from
Baa1 on July 5, making it the second euro-region country with a
non-investment-grade rating, Heathcote said.  European finance ministers last week authorized an 8.7
billion-euro loan payout to Greece, basing a second rescue
package on talks designed to ensure that banks hold onto their
Greek debt holdings.  “There are a lot of factors at play that seem to suggest
gold is well supported,” Heathcote said.  Silver for September delivery jumped 0.9 percent to $36.24
an ounce, after a 1.4 percent gain yesterday. The metal for
immediate delivery advanced 1 percent to $36.235 an ounce. Spot
palladium added 0.7 percent to $774 an ounce, while cash
platinum increased 0.2 percent to $1,728.60 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
