The Swiss franc weakened against all
of its 16 major peers as stocks rose on better-than-expected
U.S. jobs data and the  European Central Bank  signaled it may
raise  interest rates  further this year.  The Swiss currency depreciated against the euro for the
first time in three days as traders sought higher-yielding
assets. U.S. employers added 157,000 jobs in June, beating the
70,000 median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The
Stoxx Europe 600 index gained 0.4 percent. ECB President Jean- Claude Trichet said he may increase borrowing costs again in
coming months after lifting the key rate 25 basis points to 1.5
percent.  The "higher risk sentiment is bad for the Swiss franc,"
said Henrik Gullberg, a strategist at Deutsche Bank AG. "The
euro is coming round on the ECB announcement and a more balanced
assessment of the  euro zone ."  The franc, perceived as a haven in times of turmoil,
weakened 0.7 percent to 1.2101 per euro as 5:34 p.m. in  London ,
and depreciated 0.4 percent to 84.25 centimes per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
