Aston Resources Ltd. (AZT) , an Australian
coal developer, said its Maules Creek project will cost as much
as A$651 million ($696 million) to develop, 41 percent more than
a January estimate.  Brisbane-based Aston plans to start output of coking coal
at the project, located about 200 kilometers (124 miles)
northwest of Sydney, in the middle of 2013, it said in a
statement. Aston said today its share of the cost will be A$553
million, including contingency funding, compared with a total
cost estimate of A$463 million in a Jan. 28 company
presentation.  Australian mining companies are facing increasing cost
pressures as a record A$174 billion worth of minerals and energy
projects underway in the nation compete for labor and equipment,
according to government forecasts in May.  Mitsubishi Corp. and Murchison Metals Ltd. may have to pay
32 percent more to build the Oakajee port and rail project and
an iron ore mine in  Western Australia , Murchison said July 4.  Aston climbed 1.6 percent to A$8.89 at the 4:10 p.m. close
of Sydney trading, taking its gains for the year to 10 percent.
 Itochu Corp. (8001) , which owns a 15 percent stake in Maules Creek,
gained 0.5 percent to 881 yen in  Tokyo .  To contact the reporter on this story:
