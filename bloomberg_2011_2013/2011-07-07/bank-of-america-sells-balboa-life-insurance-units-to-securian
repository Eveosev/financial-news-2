Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, agreed to sell life insurance operations
to Securian Financial Group Inc. after A.M Best said it may
downgrade the business.  The deal for Balboa Life Insurance Co. and Balboa Life
Insurance Co. of  New York  is expected to be completed on Oct. 1,
 St. Paul , Minnesota-based Securian said today in a statement
that didn’t disclose terms. Bank of America was left with the
life businesses after striking a $700 million deal in February
to sell the Balboa unit that insures foreclosed properties to
QBE Insurance Group Ltd.  Bank of America acquired insurance operations in 2008 with
the purchase of home lender Countrywide Financial Corp. A.M.
Best said Feb. 16 it may downgrade the life business because the
parent company was unlikely to build the operations after the
QBE deal.  “It’s not a business that we intend to keep,” Bank of
America spokesman  Jerry Dubrowski  said in a Feb. 16 interview
about Balboa Life.  Closely held Securian, founded in 1880, provides insurance
and retirement-planning services.  “As providers exit the market, we view this as an
opportunity to increase our presence,” Securian Executive Vice
President Christopher Hilger said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
