Taiwan ’s dollar traded near its
strongest level in a month before the government reported a
bigger-than-expected  trade surplus  for June. Government bonds
fell.  The surplus of $1.38 billion exceeded the median $1.01
billion forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, according
to a report released by the Ministry of Finance at around the
time the local  currency market  closed. Export growth of 10.8
percent was less than the 20.0 percent predicted in the poll.
Overseas investors bought NT$996.6 million ($35 million) more of
the island’s shares today than they sold, exchange figures show.  The currency closed at NT$28.860 against its U.S.
counterpart, little changed from NT$28.851 yesterday, according
to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.656 on July 4, the
strongest level since June 3.  “Chinese demand for Taiwan goods remains relatively soft;
that’s primarily why the anticipated gain in exports didn’t
materialize,” said Joseph Lau, a Hong Kong-based economist at
Societe Generale SA. Currency appreciation will be gradual “as
the government strikes a balance between export growth and
reining in inflation,” he said.  The yield on the 2 percent notes due July 2016, the most-
traded  government bonds , rose one basis point to 1.16 percent,
prices from Gretai Securities Market show.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was 0.373 percent, compared with 0.370
percent yesterday, according to a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
