Middle East crude for sale to  Asia 
traded at discounts on concerns of slowing demand as  South Korea 
began selling fuel supplies under the  International Energy
Agency ’s planned release of stockpiles.  Abu Dhabi ’s Murban for August loading remained at a
discount of 8 cents a barrel to its official selling price,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Qatar Land was
unchanged at a discount of 41 cents, Bloomberg data showed.  Demand for fuels may be slowing as refiners in South Korea
absorb the first releases of supplies under the IEA’s planned
sales. The country has sold 440,000 barrels of oil products,
including gasoline and diesel, to refiners since July 1, said a
spokesman for Korea National Oil Corp. yesterday. Asia’s fourth-
biggest oil user plans to tap 3.5 million barrels of crude and
oil products from its stockpiles as part of an IEA decision to
free about 60 million barrels from reserves.  Oman futures for September delivery climbed $1.31 to
$109.46 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:13 p.m.
Singapore time, with 1,523 contracts traded. The settlement
price was $108.91 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  Oman crude for immediate loading increased $1.91, or 1.8
percent, to $108.69 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for delivery in September rose 1.8 percent to $108.43. Murban
climbed 1.7 percent to $112.73.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker against the Persian Gulf grade, widened 5
cents to $5.70 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and refined-products broker in  London .
The exchange for swaps for September rose 8 cents to $5.09.  To contact the reporter on this story:
