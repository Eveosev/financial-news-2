Jim Cooke , a Coolidge impersonator and presidential expert, wrote in to note that my  previous Echoes post  had Coolidge slightly wrong. Coolidge said: "The chief business of the American people is business" and not, as the column said, "The chief business of America is business." Jim also takes issue with my description of the cheese factory that the president's father ran in Plymouth Notch. Jim says it was more of a cooperative venture than a business for his profit alone. That makes sense. The village of Plymouth Notch created the factory as a way to sell their milk.
