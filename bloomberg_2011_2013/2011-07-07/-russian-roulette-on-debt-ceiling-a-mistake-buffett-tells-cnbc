U.S. lawmakers’ demands to lower
spending before raising the government debt ceiling are
counterproductive, billionaire  Warren Buffett  told CNBC.  “It’s just silly,” Buffett said today of attempts to
force cuts by threatening inaction on the debt ceiling. “You
really don’t have any business playing Russian roulette to get
your way in some other matter. We should be more grown up.”  Republican congressmen are pushing President  Barack Obama 
to accept spending cuts in exchange for an increase in the
nation’s $14.3 trillion legal debt limit. Obama yesterday in a
“Twitter Town Hall” criticized Republicans for using the debt-
ceiling “as a gun against the heads of the American people” to
extract tax cuts.  “When you have somebody with a gun to your head, do you
really come out with the greatest, the most properly reasoned
solution to something?” Buffett said.  Buffett said businesses at his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  are
doing better and the company employs more people than it did
months ago. Hiring “will take a real jump” if  home
construction  picks up, Buffett said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
