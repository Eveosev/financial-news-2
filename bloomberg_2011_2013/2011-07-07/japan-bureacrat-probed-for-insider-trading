Japanese investigators are probing a
government official for suspected trading of  Elpida Memory Inc. (6665) 
stock in 2009 based on undisclosed information about a state-led
bailout, the Nikkei newspaper reported, citing people familiar
with the matter.  The Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission is
investigating whether the official -- a deputy director general
at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry when Elpida was
applying for government assistance two years ago -- bought
shares of the chipmaker through a third-party account before the
ministry announced the approval of an aid package on June 30,
2009, according to the report.  The aid allowed Elpida to raise 30 billion yen ($371
million) via preferred shares sold to the state-run  Development
Bank  of Japan and receive 110 billion yen in loans. Elpida
posted a net loss of 178.9 billion yen in the year ended March
31 that year. The shares rose 1.7 percent the day after the
approval.  Tatsushi Terada, a director at  Japan â€™s SESC, Hiroshi
Chishima, an assistant director at METI and Takehiro Fukuda, a
Tokyo-based spokesman at Elpida, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
