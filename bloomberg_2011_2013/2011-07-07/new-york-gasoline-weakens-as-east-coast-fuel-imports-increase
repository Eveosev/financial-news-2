New York  gasoline weakened as the
government reported imports to the region rose last week.  Gasoline shipments to the East Coast increased 22,000
barrels a day to 645,000 barrels, according to the Energy
Department.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in New
York Harbor widened 0.25 cent to 6.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 1:59 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery rose
10.15 cents to $3.0341 a gallon.  The same fuel in the  Gulf Coast  narrowed its discount 0.12
cent to 10.38 cents a gallon.  PBF Energy Partners LP was in the process of starting a
compressor yesterday at its  Delaware  City oil refinery in
Delaware, according to a filing with regulators.  The refinery, shut since November 2009, was expected to
start in the second quarter.  An electrical malfunction July 5 at Exxon Mobil Corp.’s
Beaumont refinery in Texas caused an upset at a processing unit,
Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  “We anticipate some impact to production but expect to
meet all customer commitments,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
