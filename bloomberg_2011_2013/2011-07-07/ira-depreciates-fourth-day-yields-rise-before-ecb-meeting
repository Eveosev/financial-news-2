The lira depreciated for the fourth
day against the dollar and bond yields rose for a second day
before the European Central Bank meeting on rates and
speculation of further increases in borrowing costs.  The lira weakened 0.3 percent to 1.6370 per dollar at 2:10
p.m. in Istanbul, heading for its weakest closing level in more
than a week. Two-year benchmark bonds advanced three basis
points, 0.03 percentage point, to 9 percent, a second day of
advances.  The ECB will raise  interest rates  for a second time this
year, increasing the benchmark by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent
when council members meet in  Frankfurt  today, according to all
55 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The central
bank may increase borrowing costs further in the fourth quarter,
according to a separate survey.  The lira has depreciated 5.6 percent this year against the
dollar, making it the worst performer among emerging-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  The  ISE National 100 Index (XU100)  of stocks dropped for a third
day, falling less than 0.1 percent to 63,213.  To contact the reporter on this story:
