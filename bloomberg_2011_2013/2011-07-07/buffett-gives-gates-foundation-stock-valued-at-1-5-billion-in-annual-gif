Warren Buffett , who is urging fellow
billionaires to commit most of their wealth to philanthropy,
gave away stock valued at about $1.5 billion in his annual gift
to the foundation established by  Bill Gates .  The donation of 19.3 million  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  Class
B shares was made today, according to a filing. The shares
closed at $77.77 today on the New York Stock Exchange.  Buffett has pledged the majority of his holdings to the
 Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation  and to charities run by his
three children and one named after his first wife, Susan Thompson Buffett, who died in 2004. His chosen philanthropies
combat poverty and disease, fund U.S. education initiatives and
promote access to abortions.  “Intelligent charity, big-time charity should tackle
things where it’ll fail,” Buffett, 80, said at a press
conference in Bangalore in March. “If you succeed in everything
you’re doing in charity, you’re attempting things that are too
easy.”  Buffett said in 2006 when he  pledged  10 million B shares to
the Gates Foundation, that he’d release 5 percent of the
remaining balance every year, meaning each installment includes
fewer shares than the prior award. Buffett, the chairman and
chief executive officer of Berkshire, said he expected
appreciation of the stock to compensate for the diminishing
number of shares. The stock had a 50-1 split early last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
