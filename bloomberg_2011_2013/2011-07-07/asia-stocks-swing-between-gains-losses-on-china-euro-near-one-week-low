Stocks rallied, sending the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index to an almost two-month high, and commodities
rose as data on jobs and retail sales bolstered optimism in the
economy. The euro fell as the region’s debt crisis overshadowed
a European Central Bank interest-rate increase.  The  S&P 500  gained 0.8 percent to 1,349.91 at 9:37 a.m. in
New York, above its highest close since May 10. The S&P GSCI

said  Mike Ryan , the New York-based chief investment strategist
at UBS Wealth Management Americas, which manages more than $700
billion. “Now we have a sense that the ADP report looks like
we’re going to see a better payroll report. All these things
reflected that this was no more than a soft patch. This is not
another recession.”  The S&P 500 has recovered almost all of its loss after
slumping as much as 7.2 percent from the end of April through
June 15 amid disappointing economic data.  Retailers Gain  Gains in the S&P 500 today were led by retailers and banks.

enticed consumers to spend.  The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for an advance of 70,000 in the ADP report. Jobless

jobs, economists said.  Four stocks advanced for every one that fell in the Stoxx
