Brazilian President  Dilma Rousseff  is
more concerned about containing inflation than stemming a rally
in the nation’s currency, said a government official familiar
with her views.  The government isn’t weighing any further steps to stem
gains by the real, the best-performing currency in Latin America
over the last six months, said the official who can’t be named
because he isn’t authorized to discuss her policies publicly.  Valor Economico  newspaper reported today that Rousseff has
not authorized her finance minister,  Guido Mantega , to adopt
measures to curb the 7.7 percent gains against the  U.S. dollar 
since Jan. 7. The Sao Paulo-based newspaper, citing government
officials it did not name, said Rousseff considers the rally a
welcome boost to the government’s fight against inflation.  Brazil ’s dollar purchases have fallen every month since
March, according to the central bank. The bank bought $2.3
billion in June, down from $8.4 billion in March.  Central bank President Alexandre Tombini told a senate
hearing July 5 that the country’s foreign currency reserves are
at an “adequate” level.  To contact the reporters on this story:
