The  European Investment Bank  said
it’s still discussing a possible new loan to upgrade a bridge in
the Serbian capital, Belgrade, denying media reports it has
rejected the financing request.  “At the moment there’s no decision from the EIB on a
second possible loan,” the European Union’s lending arm said in
an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News.  Serbia’s state-owned road builder JP Putevi Srbije has
asked the EIB to lend it as much as 25 million euros, in
addition to a 33 million-euro loan granted in 2007, to complete
the reconstruction of the  Gazela Bridge , Belgrade’s main bridge.  Serbia’s Press newspaper reported today that the EIB was
unhappy with resettlement plans for Roma families who have lived
under the bridge for decades and was halting further financing
for the reconstruction, which is being led by Austria’s  Strabag
SE. (STR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
