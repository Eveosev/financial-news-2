Serbia ’s top priority is battling
crime and corruption to bring the country closer to European
Union membership before the next parliamentary elections, Prime
Minister  Mirko Cvetkovic  said.  The state has already cut corruption and seized more than
300 million euros ($430 million) worth of illegally gained
assets since 2008, Cvetkovic said in a speech today marking the
government’s third year in power, the longest tenure since 2000
when former leader  Slobodan Milosevic  was ousted.  The government wants to ensure that Serbia becomes an
official candidate for European Union membership by the end of
the year and possibly start entry talks, he said. Parliamentary
elections are due in mid-2012.  “Serbia has become a pillar in battling crime in the
region,” Cvetkovic said in Belgrade. “We continue to work to
make Serbia a member of the European family.”  Among the former Yugoslav republics, only Slovenia is in
the EU, while Croatia expects to join in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
