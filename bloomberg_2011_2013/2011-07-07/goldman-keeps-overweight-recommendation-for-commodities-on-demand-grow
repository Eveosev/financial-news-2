Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  kept its
overweight recommendation for commodities on a three, six and
12-month horizon as well as its 20 percent return forecast in
the next year.  Demand growth is likely to be sufficient to tighten key
markets, while progress in dealing with the Greek budget crisis
and better economic data has improved sentiment around cyclical
assets in recent days, the bank said.  Goldman reiterated its long-trading recommendations for
Brent crude oil, U.K. natural gas, copper, zinc and soybeans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
