Ethanol futures rose in  Chicago  as
its discount to gasoline widened, spurring increased use by
blenders.  The grain-based gasoline additive jumped as the discount
widened to 50.6 cents, the most since May 31. Refiners receive a
45-cent tax credit for each gallon mixed into the motor fuel, in
addition to the spread between the two.  “There’s still a healthy margin, there’s still the tax
credit,” said Justin Dirico, senior ethanol trader at SCB &
Associates in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery rose 4.2 cents, or
1.6 percent, to settle at $2.621 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Futures have gained 65 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast increased
3 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.815 a gallon and in  New York  the
biofuel jumped 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.81, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.80 a gallon and in Chicago the biofuel advanced 1.5 cents,
or 0.6 percent, to $2.75.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
rose 1.7 percent to a record 5.26 million barrels a day last
week, while supply plunged 4.8 percent to 18.6 million barrels,
the Energy Department said today.  Gasoline for August delivery gained 12.94 cents, or 4.3
percent, to settle at $3.127 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
