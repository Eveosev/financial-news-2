Finbank Plc (FIRSTINL)  rose to its highest this
month after the Vanguard reported  First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) 
is in the process of concluding its purchase of the Nigerian
lender bailed out by the central bank in 2009.  The stock climbed 2 kobo, or 3.6 percent, to 57 kobo by the
2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the highest level since June 30.  The newspaper cited First City’s head of corporate affairs,
Kenny Alliu regarding the the transaction.  “FinBank is currently trading at peanuts and information
such as its recapitalization with FCMB is a motivator for
investors to move in,” Ifeanyi Odunwa, managing director of
Lagos-based Investment Centre Ltd., a brokerage, said by phone.  First City Monument Bank signed a memorandum of
understanding to merge with and recapitalize Finbank, Alliu said
May 5. The central bank fired eight chief executives of
 Nigeria ’s 24 banks in 2009 after a debt crisis, in part
resulting from loans to domestic stock speculators, threatened
the country’s banking industry with collapse. The regulator
bailed out the industry with 620 billion naira ($4 billion).
Finbank was one of the beneficiaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
