Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  got permission
to drill an exploration well near the World Heritage-listed
Ningaloo Reef in  Australia  after the government decided against
referring it for a more detailed environmental review.  Shell,  Europe ’s largest oil company, will drill the Palta-1
well about 70 kilometers (44 miles) from the Ningaloo Reef, the
Hague-based company said today in a  statement .  “The Exmouth Sub-basin is an important region for oil and
gas production in Australia with existing exploration and
production facilities operating safely in the region for many
years,” the company said.  Shell must follow measures to protect the environment, the
Australian Environment Department said on its website.  Shell said in March it expected to drill the well off the
northwest coast as early as September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
