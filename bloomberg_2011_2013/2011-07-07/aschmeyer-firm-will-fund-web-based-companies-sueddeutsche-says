Carsten Maschmeyer, the former chief
executive officer of AWD Holding AG, founded a venture-capital
firm that will provide funds for medical and renewable-energy
companies doing business over the Internet,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  The Frankfurt-based firm, called Alternative Investments,
is a unit of MM Vermoegensverwaltungs GmbH, according to the
newspaper. Joerg Goschin will manage the firmâ€™s daily business,
starting in August, the Sueddeutsche said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
