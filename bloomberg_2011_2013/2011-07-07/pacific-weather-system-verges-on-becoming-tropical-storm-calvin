A tropical depression churning off
the Pacific coast of  Mexico  may become Tropical Storm Calvin
later today or tomorrow, according to the U.S.  National
Hurricane Center .  The center of the depression was 260 miles (418 kilometers)
south-southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico, moving west-northwest at
14 miles per hour, according to an  advisory  released shortly
before 4 p.m. Mexico City time yesterday.  The top winds are 35 mph, just under the 39 mph threshold
needed to be classified as a tropical storm and given a name.
The center said in an update at 8 p.m. New York time that it is
issuing advisories on the depression.  In addition to the Pacific system, the hurricane center is
tracking areas of disturbed weather in the Atlantic. One area,
which stretches from Mexicoâ€™s Yucatan Peninsula to  Florida , has
a 40 percent chance of becoming a tropical or subtropical storm
in 48 hours.  Subtropical storms receive names as well as tropical storms.
They differ from tropical storms in that their strongest winds
may occur away from the center.  The second system, 400 miles east-southeast of the Windward
Islands, has a 10 percent chance of becoming a storm.  Hurricanes are watched closely because they are a threat to
oil and natural gas interests in the  Gulf of Mexico  and
agriculture in the South. Florida is the second-largest citrus
producer behind  Brazil , while the Gulf accounts for 31 percent
of U.S. oil output and 43 percent of refining capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
