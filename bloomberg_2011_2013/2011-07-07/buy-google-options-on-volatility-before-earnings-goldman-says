Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
trading  Google Inc. (GOOG)  equity options because the worldâ€™s largest
Internet-search company tends to post bigger-than-average price
swings after quarterly results.  Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall, equity derivatives
strategists at the New York-based bank, encouraged buying July
$535 calls and the same number of July $535 puts, a strategy
known as a straddle. They gave the recommendation in a report
released yesterday.  Google shares moved an average of 6.1 percent in the first
trading session after the  Mountain View , California-based
company released its last eight quarterly reports, according to
data compiled by Goldman Sachs. That compares with an average of
1 percent on all other days, Goldman Sachs said. Google will
report second-quarter profit of $7.86 a share excluding some
items on July 14, according to the average analyst estimate in a
Bloomberg survey.  The stock has climbed eight consecutive days, the longest
streak since December, cutting its 2011 loss to 9.2 percent.
Google rose 0.8 percent to $539.36 at 11:11 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
