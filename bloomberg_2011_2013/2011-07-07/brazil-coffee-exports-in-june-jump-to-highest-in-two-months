Coffee shipments from  Brazil , the
world’s largest producer of the commodity, jumped 24 percent in
June from a year earlier, said exporters’ council  CeCafe .  Shipments, which include instant coffee, increased to 2.65
million bags last month from 2.14 million bags in June 2010, the
group said today in an e-mailed statement. It is the highest
volume since April, when Brazil shipped 2.74 million bags.  Exports of arabica beans rose 18 percent to 1.96 million
bags, CeCafe said. Shipments of the robusta variety, used mostly
to make instant coffee, more than doubled to 405,773 bags from
165,937.  A bag of coffee weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  To contact the reporter on this story:
