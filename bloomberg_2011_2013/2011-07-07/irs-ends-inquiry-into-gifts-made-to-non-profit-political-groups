The  Internal Revenue Service  said it
is dropping an inquiry involving five taxpayers who made gifts
to a type of non-profit group increasingly used in recent
elections to underwrite advertising and other political
expenses.  The IRS, which said today it was ending the probe, had
sought to determine if the five taxpayers owed gift taxes for
donations to non-profit groups organized under section 501(c)(4)
of the U.S. tax code. The IRS didnâ€™t identify the donors. News
reports of the inquiry led to criticism of the agency,
especially from Republican lawmakers, who said the scrutiny
could chill political speech.  The IRS has asserted the authority to collect gift taxes
from the groups. There is little evidence it has collected the
taxes over the past 30 years.  In a brief  statement  on its web site, the IRS said any
future action would come only after it has given public notice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
