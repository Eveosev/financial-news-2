The U.S. Energy Department offered a
$105 million conditional loan guarantee to Poet LLC to develop a
cellulosic ethanol plant in  Iowa .  Poet plans to build a facility in Emmetsburg that will be
able to convert corncobs, leaves and husks into 25 million
gallons (95 million liters) of ethanol a year, the agency said
today in a statement. The project will be the first commercial-
scale cellulosic ethanol plant in the U.S., according to the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
