IGas Energy Plc (IGAS) , a U.K. coal-bed
methane explorer, said the gas can make a “material”
contribution to Britain’s energy supply.  The company has signed a second rig contract for its Doe
Green site in northwest  England , according to a statement today,
in an attempt to produce commercial quantities of natural gas
found in seams of coal. IGas says it has enough reserves to
supply 15 percent of U.K. homes with electricity for 15 years.  “It could become a material part of the mix in the U.K.,”
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Austin said in a telephone
interview. “Within the next couple of years, we should be able
to demonstrate that we can produce positive earnings on
projects.”  The company also has shale gas acreage, though Austin said
it will focus on production from coal beds first because the
environmental impact is lower. The London-based explorer is
seeking to show it can produce gas at commercial rates after
completing pilot projects, he said.  IGas said in May that its 2010 full-year loss widened to
1.54 million pounds ($2.5 million) from 504,000 pounds in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
