The Swiss government needs to
negotiate with  Germany  and the U.K. over improved  market access 
for banks and “technical” issues, Nicolas Pictet, head of the
Swiss Private Bankers Association, told  L’Agefi .  Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf is wrong to
say that the “ball is in the court” of bankers, Pictet said in
an interview in today’s newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
