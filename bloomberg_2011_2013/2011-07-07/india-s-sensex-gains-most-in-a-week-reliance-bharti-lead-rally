India ’s benchmark stock index rose to
a two-month high as foreign funds increased their holdings of
local equities to benefit from the nation’s economic growth and
as food inflation slowed to a seven-week low.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , India’s most valuable company,
gained the most in two weeks on speculation the government will
next week approve its deal with BP Plc.  Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) , the
largest cell-phone operator, jumped 3.7 percent. Overseas funds
have been net buyers of stocks for 10 trading days.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
351.33, or 1.9 percent, to 19,078.30 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, the highest level since April 29 and within 1 percent of
the gauge’s 200-day moving average. The S&P CNX Nifty Index
climbed 1.8 percent to 5,728.95. The BSE 200 Index added 1.7
percent to 2,357.96.  “Some serious investors are getting in because they think
that over a period of time when the concerns abate, which they
will, the market will be pretty attractive,” P. Phani Sekhar, a
 fund manager  at Angel Broking Ltd. in Mumbai, said by phone. He
favors shares of lenders and infrastructure companies.  Overseas funds bought $523 million more stocks than they
sold in the first three days of this week, taking net purchases
this year to $1.6 billion, data compiled by the regulator show.
India’s $1.4 trillion economy expanded 7.8 percent in the first
quarter of 2011 from a year earlier, compared with 8.3 percent
in the previous three months, government data show.  China yesterday raised benchmark  interest rates  for the
third time this year after inflation accelerated at the fastest
pace since July 2008. India’s central bank has raised borrowing
costs 10 times since the start of 2010 to cool rising prices.  BP Stake  Reliance, owner of the world’s largest refining complex,
surged 2.1 percent to 870.7 rupees, its steepest climb since
June 23. BP’s plan to buy stakes in 23 oil and gas blocks in
India operated by Reliance for $7.2 billion may receive cabinet
approval next week, an oil ministry official with knowledge of
the matter said.  BP wants to tap  Asia ’s second-biggest energy-consuming
nation and announced the partnership with Reliance on Feb. 21.
BP plans to acquire a 30 percent stake in each of the Reliance
blocks, including KG-D6 off India’s east coast, the nation’s
biggest gas deposit, where production has fallen because of
technical difficulties at the reservoir.  “Reliance is having problems raising production from the
KG-D6 field and getting BP as a partner should remedy that,”
D.K. Aggarwal, chairman of SMC Wealth Management Services Ltd.,
said by telephone from  New Delhi . “A straightforward approval
helps Reliance immensely.”  Reliance has a 10.2 percent weighting on the Sensex, the
highest among the 30 companies that make up the index.  Copper Prices  Bharti surged 3.8 percent to 398 rupees, the most since May
9. The company formed two new business units to service retail
and corporate clients of the company in India and  South Asia ,
effective Aug. 1, according to a statement today.  Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the biggest copper and
zinc producer, lost 0.8 percent to 170.25 rupees, as global
prices fell after  China , the biggest metal user, raised rates.
Sterlite was the only stock to drop on the Sensex today.  Commodity prices tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Index of 24 raw materials declined 7.8 percent in the second
quarter, the worst performance since 2008, as the  U.S. economy 
slowed and China tightened monetary policy.  “Commodity prices have started correcting and that is a
positive for our inflation expectation as we are net importers
of commodities,” Angel’s Sekhar said.  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT) , the largest engineering company,
jumped 3.2 percent to 1,863.45 rupees. Its unit L&T Finance
Holdings Ltd. raised 3.3 billion rupees selling 60 million
shares at 55 rupees each to the U.S.-based private equity fund
Capital International, according to a exchange filing.  Rural Demand  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) , the biggest household products
maker, climbed for the first time in five days, gaining 1.8
percent to 335.75 rupees.  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the largest
maker of tractors, advanced 1.5 percent to 726.15 rupees on
speculation higher farm output, spurred by adequate rain, will
lift demand for its products.  The country received 209.4 millimeters of rain between June
1 and July 5, more than the 206.5 millimeters average deemed
normal for the period, the weather office said on its website
yesterday. Rains were 11 percent above normal in June.  “A good monsoon will be next big driver for stocks,” said
George Verghese, assistance vice president at Unicon Securities
Ltd. in Mumbai.  Bigger crops of rice, sugar cane, soybeans and oilseeds
will aid the government’s efforts to curb food prices. An index
measuring wholesale prices of farm products rose 7.61 percent in
the week ended June 25 from a year earlier, the commerce
ministry said today. It gained 7.78 percent the previous week.  The rupee advanced, snapping a two-day decline, after
global funds added to holdings of local shares, gained 0.2
percent to 44.42 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
