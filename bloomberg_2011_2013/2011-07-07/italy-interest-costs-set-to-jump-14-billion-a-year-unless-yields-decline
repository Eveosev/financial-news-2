Italy  risks becoming a debt crisis
casualty if bond yields remain at their current levels because
annual interest costs will jump by more than $14 billion,
according to Gary Jenkins at Evolution Securities Ltd.  Yields on Italy’s 10-year bonds yesterday exceeded 5
percent for the first time since 2008, threatening to add an
extra 9.7 billion euros ($14.3 billion) to coupon payments,
Jenkins, London-based head of fixed income at the brokerage,
wrote in a note. The nation has more than 860 billion euros of
notes maturing in the next five years, he wrote.  Italy has so far avoided being sucked into the crises that
have engulfed  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal , and which threaten
 Spain . Lawmakers are seeking to balance the budget by 2014 and
plan to push deficit-cutting measures worth 40 billion euros
though Parliament later this year.  “If contagion spreads to the point where Spain is unable
to fund itself in the market and there is concern over private
participation in any bailouts, it is difficult to see how highly
indebted Italy could escape unhurt,” Jenkins wrote. “Debt
reduction will become considerably harder if contagion spreads
and funding costs increase further.”  Italian 10-year bonds fell today, driving the additional
yield investors demand to hold the securities instead of
benchmark German bunds to the most since before the euro was
introduced in 1999. The Italian yield increased six basis points
to 5.18 percent, pushing the difference in yield, or spread, to
bunds to 224 basis points.  Debt Pile  The nation, which has more than 1.6 trillion euros of bonds
outstanding, the world’s third-largest pile of debt after the
U.S. and  Japan , already spends more than 4.25 percent of
economic output servicing its debt, according to Jenkins. Each
percentage point increase in rates would cost it about 9 billion
euros, or 0.6 percent of gross domestic product, if applied over
the whole 2011-2016 period, according to the note.  The average coupon on the nation’s fixed-rate bonds is
about 4.125 percent, compared with an average 3.6 percent for
those maturing through 2015, according to Jenkins.  The nation also has 260 billion euros of one-year notes,
according to Evolution. While the average yield on one-year
notes is 1.8 percent over the past year, that has now increased
to about 2.25 percent, adding 1.2 billion euros to servicing
costs, Jenkins wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
