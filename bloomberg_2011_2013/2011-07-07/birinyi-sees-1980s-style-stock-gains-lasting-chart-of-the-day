The current  bull market  in U.S.
stocks is following a course set during the 1980s that points
toward further gains, according to Laszlo Birinyi, president and
founder of Birinyi Associates Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index’s advance since March 2009, when it dropped to a 12-year
low, with its advance from August 1982 through August 1987. The
S&P 500 more than tripled during the earlier period.  History suggests the S&P 500 will exceed 1,500 by August of
next year after rising about 15 percent, Birinyi wrote yesterday
in a report. The index is 1.8 percent away from surpassing this
year’s peak of 1,363.61, set on April 29, and has almost doubled
in the past 28 months.  Stocks will climb as “investors recognize that the market
is for real,” Birinyi wrote. He referred to this acceptance as
the third of four phases in a typical bull market.  The first two phases are an initial rally and a
consolidation, when share prices meander, he wrote. The fourth
happens when stock buyers go “all in,” or have as much
invested as they can.  Birinyi, one of the first money managers to advise buying
U.S. stocks before they bottomed two years ago, reaffirmed an
estimate that the index will rise above 2,000 before the bull
market ends. In January, he predicted that the  S&P 500  would
reach 2,854 on Sept. 4, 2013, based on historical precedent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
