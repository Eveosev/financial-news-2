Russian billionaire  Alisher Usmanov ,
Arsenal’s second-largest stockholder, spent 952,000 pounds ($1.5
million) to buy 68 more shares in the North London-based soccer
team and edge closer to a 30 percent holding.  The purchase from an individual stockholder yesterday, at
14,000 pounds a share, comes after the close of an offer Usmanov
made to Arsenal shareholders at the same price in May. The
purchase was announced on website of the  Plus  exchange, where
Arsenal is listed.  The price was higher than the 11,750-pound offer that
majority owner  Stan Kroenke  made after buying about 30 percent
of the club’s stock from former directors Nina Bracewell-Smith
and Danny Fiszman. Usmanov has increased his stake to more than
29 percent from 27.4 percent since making his share offer.
Kroenke holds about 67 percent.  A 30 percent stake would give Usmanov the same access to
management accounts as any Arsenal director. Usmanov, who hasn’t
been given a seat on the Premier League team’s board, has
criticized the club for not spending more money on strengthening
the squad. His offer to underwrite a rights offer of shares was
rejected by the club in July 2009.  Kroenke didn’t immediately respond to a voicemail seeking
comment.  He and Usmanov have been battling for control of Arsenal, a
13-time English league champion. Usmanov told Bloomberg News
he’s not willing to sell his shares to the American, who has
interests in a range of U.S. sports teams including the  National
Football League ’s St. Louis Rams and basketball’s  Denver
Nuggets .  Usmanov said Kroenke has declined to meet with him and
discuss his plans for the club. Arsenal supporters have started
to complain about a lack of investment in a team that hasn’t won
a trophy since 2005.  Usmanov first took a stake in the club in 2007, when he
bought 15 percent for 75 million pounds from former board member
 David Dein .  To contact the reporter on this story:
