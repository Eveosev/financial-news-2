Twitter Inc. co-founder Biz Stone is
joining venture firm Spark Capital as a strategic adviser,
according to a blog posting from Spark partner Bijan Sabet.  “Biz will help us think through and evaluate new
investment opportunities,” Sabet said in the  posting .
“Additionally he will provide us with valuable insight about
our current portfolio companies.”  Stone, 37, announced last month that he was taking a
further step back from Twitter along with fellow co-founder  Evan Williams , so they could devote their time to Obvious Corp., a
company aimed at incubating new ideas. Stone and Williams began
working together after leaving  Google Inc. (GOOG)  in 2005, and
developed a project that led to the formation of Twitter two
years later.  Spark, a Boston-based firm founded in 2005, is an investor
in Twitter and Sabet serves on the social-networking company’s
board. Spark first took a stake in San Francisco-based Twitter
in  2008  and participated in the next two financings the
following year.  In addition to Twitter, Sabet led Spark’s investments in
Web and mobile companies  Tumblr Inc. , Foursquare Labs Inc. and
Boxee Inc.  Jack Dorsey, who co-founded Twitter with Stone and
Williams, returned to an active role with the company this year.
He is also chief executive officer of Square Inc., a mobile-
payment company that he started in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
