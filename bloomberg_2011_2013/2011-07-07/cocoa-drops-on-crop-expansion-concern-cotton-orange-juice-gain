Cocoa fell to its lowest price this
week on concern that producers are planning at least 60 projects
worldwide that will expand output and overwhelm demand. Cotton,
 orange-juice  and coffee futures gained.  The International Cocoa Organization estimates the new
projects may boost annual production to 6 million metric tons.
While the ICCO expects supply and demand to be balanced in the
year that begins in October, a ramp-up in production risks
“flooding the market and causing another price collapse,”
Executive Director Jean-Marc Anga said in a statement.  “Some people think it’s going to weigh on the market, and
going into the third quarter, when you run into the new crop as
well, I really wouldn’t argue against that,” said Drew Geraghty, a broker at ICAP Futures LLC in  Jersey City ,  New
Jersey .  Cocoa for September delivery fell $2, or 0.1 percent, to
settle at $3,186 a metric ton at 12:13 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S.
in  New York , after touching $3,119, the lowest since July 1.  Prices are down 16 percent since reaching a 32-year high of
$3,775 on March 4, after supplies had been disrupted by a civil
war in  Ivory Coast , the world’s largest grower.  Cotton futures for December delivery gained 0.1 cent, or
0.1 percent, to settle at $1.1352 a pound on ICE, after touching
$1.1226 a pound, the lowest since Nov. 29. The fiber has
declined 48 percent from a record $2.197 on March 7.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 1.8 cents,
or 1 percent, to settle at $1.906 a pound on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery climbed 1.1
cents, or 0.4 percent, to settle at $2.686 a pound on ICE.  In  London , cocoa futures gained, and robusta coffee fell.  To contact the reporter on this story:
