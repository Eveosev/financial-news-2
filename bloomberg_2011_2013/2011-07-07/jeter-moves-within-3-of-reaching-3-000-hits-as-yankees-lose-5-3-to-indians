Derek Jeter  moved within three hits
of 3,000 in the New York Yankees’ 5-3 loss to the Cleveland
Indians.  Jeter, 37, will return to Yankee Stadium tonight where he
has four home games against the Tampa Bay Rays to become the
28th Major League Baseball player and first Yankee to reach the
milestone.  “I’m definitely looking forward to going back to New York,”
Jeter told reporters after last night’s game at Progressive
Field in Cleveland. Yankees fans “care a lot about the history
of the organization, so I would anticipate them being animated.
I don’t know, but I probably think it will be kind of fun.”  Jeter, facing Indians pitcher Justin Masterson, struck out,
flied out and walked before hitting his 479th career double in
the eighth inning.  Masterson (7-6) held the Yankees scoreless through eight
innings, allowing three hits and striking out six.  Travis Hafner hit a one-run single and Asdrubal Cabrera
scored on a throwing error to give the Indians a 2-0 lead in the
first inning.  Lonnie Chisenhall homered in the seventh and one inning
later  Carlos Santana  walked to score Austin Kearns before
Michael Brantley scored on Grady Sizemore’s sacrifice fly.  Nick Swisher  doubled in the ninth to drive in  Alex Rodriguez ,  Robinson Cano  scored on Jorge Posada’s ground out and
Swisher completed the scoring on Russell Martin’s ground out.  Yankees pitcher Phil Hughes (0-2) gave up six hits and two
runs in five innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
