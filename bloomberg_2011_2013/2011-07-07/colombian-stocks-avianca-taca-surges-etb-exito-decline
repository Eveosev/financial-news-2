The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 0.1 percent to 13,846.66, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.2 percent to 1,673.86.  Almacenes Exito SA (EXITO)  ,  Colombia ’s biggest publicly
traded retailer, fell 0.8 percent to 23,540 pesos, the lowest
since Feb. 22. The stock fell for a second consecutive day after
Exito shareholders approved plans to raise as much as $1.4
billion by selling new shares as the company is to buy a stake
in Uruguayan supermarkets from majority shareholder Casino
Guichard-Perrachon SA, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday.  Avianca Taca Holding SA (PFAVTA CB), owner of Colombia’s
biggest airline, rose the most since it began trading May 11 as
first-half passenger traffic rose 19.4 percent from a year ago,
and the company denied speculation that it may soon issue new
shares, according to regulatory filings. The stock rose 3
percent to 4,840 pesos after rising as much as 3.8 percent
earlier.  Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogota (ETB)  SA, the
phone company serving Colombia’s capital, fell 2.1 percent, the
most since June 15, to 737 pesos. The company will lose value
should the city decide not to sell a stake in the service
provider, Beatriz Arbelaez, Bogota’s former secretary of
finance, told RCN Radio. Arbelaez said she resigned because of
differences with acting Bogota Mayor Clara Lopez, who opposes
selling a stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
