World food prices rose in June as
the cost of sugar, meat and dairy increased, adding to
inflationary pressure that has prompted central banks across
the world to raise  interest rates .  An index of 55 food commodities rose to 233.8 points from
231.4 points in May, the  United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture
Organization  said in a report on its website today. The gauge
climbed to an all-time high of 237.7 in February.  Food will remain costly in the next few years and price
swings will be around “for a long time,” Jose Graziano da
Silva, the FAO’s director-general elect, said June 27. The
 European Central Bank  raised rates today for the second time
this year and  China  did so for the third time yesterday in a bid
to control inflation partly blamed on food costs.  “We’re not yet seeing any break,”  Abdolreza Abbassian , a
senior economist at the FAO, said via phone from  Rome  today.
“Almost in every country, including in  Europe , the issue of
higher food prices has already become tangible.”  The price of staple foods including corn will more than
double in two decades without action, Oxfam International said
in May. World food output will have to rise 70 percent by 2050
as the global population climbs to 9.2 billion from an estimated
6.9 billion in 2010, the FAO estimates.  Agricultural Output  Growth in agricultural output will slow to 1.7 percent a
year through 2020, compared with 2.6 percent in the previous
decade, FAO and the Paris-based Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said in a report last month.  “The question of how to satisfy the food needs of an
expanding population with ever more sophisticated tastes and an
increasingly unified mode of consumption is getting even more
pressing,” analysts Veronique Riches-Flores and Loic de Galzain at Societe Generale SA wrote in a report yesterday.  The FAO sugar index jumped 15 percent to 357.7 points, as
production in  Brazil , the world’s largest producer of the
sweetener, is forecast to fall below last year’s level, the FAO
said. That lifted the entire food index, Abbassian said. Raw
sugar futures jumped 14 percent in  New York  last month.  “The surprise was sugar,” Abbassian said. “If it wasn’t
for sugar we would certainly see a decline.”  Policy makers in Europe are concerned that surging energy
and commodity costs will spark a wage-price spiral, further
entrenching inflation. The inflation rate in the 17-nation euro
region was 2.7 percent in June, exceeding the ECB’s 2 percent
ceiling for a seventh straight month.  ECB Meeting  The ECB will raise the benchmark by 25 basis points to 1.5
percent, when council members meet in  Frankfurt  today, according
to all 55 economist forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The
central bank may increase borrowing costs further in the fourth
quarter, according to a separate survey.  The FAO’s dairy index rose to 231.6 points from 231.1
points, lifted by rising prices for skimmed-milk powder, while
the gauge for meat prices advanced to 180.4 points from 180,
matching the April record level. Poultry-meat prices rose 3
percent to a record, according to the FAO.  “High feed prices are making their way into those
sectors,” Abbassian said. “Given the lag, one shouldn’t expect
meat and dairy prices to come down just because the corn price
came down last week.”  U.S. spot prices for milk rose 16 percent in June,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  Cereals Index  The FAO cereals index fell for a second month to 258.5
points from 261.3 points in May. The index is still 71 percent
above its year-earlier level.  “There has been some softening of prices, but with the big
harvests coming in the Northern Hemisphere, this is the
seasonal low,” Abbassian said. “And the seasonal low of this
year is pretty high already, we’re well above last year.”  The FAO’s index of cereal prices fell to 151.2 points in
June 2010, the lowest level for the year.  Corn prices fell 17 percent in  Chicago  in June, the
biggest monthly decline since October 2008, while wheat slumped
21 percent, the biggest such drop since February 1986. Soybean
futures fell 6 percent.  “Dangerous levels” of food prices had pushed about 44
million people into poverty since June,  World Bank  President
 Robert Zoellick  said in February. Another 10 million may join
them should the UN food index rise another 10 percent, the
World Bank said April 16. The number of hungry people in the
world declined last year to 925 million from more than 1
billion in 2009, according to the FAO.  Imports Bill  The world’s countries will spend $1.29 trillion to import
food this year, the most ever and 21 percent more than in 2010,
the FAO estimates.  The FAO, set up in 1945 as a specialized UN agency, says
it leads international efforts to defeat hunger and helps
developing countries improve farming. Its mandate includes
lifting nutrition levels and agricultural productivity.  Global production of wheat, coarse grains and rice in the
2011-12 season will be more than forecast last month, the FAO
said in a separate statement on its website today.  World wheat output will climb to 675.6 million metric tons
from 653.9 million tons in 2010-11, 4.7 million tons more than
its June 22 outlook, the FAO said. Production of coarse grains,
which includes corn and barley, will rise to 1.16 billion tons
from 1.12 billion tons, an increase of 5.9 tons from the June
outlook, according to the FAO.  Rice production in 2011-12 is forecast to climb to 476.1
million tons from 463.7 million tons a year earlier, the FAO
said. The outlook was raised by 600,000 tons from June 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
