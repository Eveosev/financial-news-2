A Planned Parenthood affiliate sued
 North Carolina  in federal court to stop a state law that cuts
off federal and state funds to the group.  The lawsuit, filed today in Greensboro by Planned
Parenthood of Central North Carolina, alleges a June 15 law
enacted by the state’s legislature violates the U.S.
Constitution and would deprive low income people of “much-
needed health and teen pregnancy prevention services.”  The case is Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina v.
Cansler, 11-cv-531, U.S. District Court, Middle District of
North Carolina (Greensboro).  To contact the reporter on this story:
