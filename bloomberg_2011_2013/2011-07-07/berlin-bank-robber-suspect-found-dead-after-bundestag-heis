A 48-year-old man suspected of
robbing a post office bank inside one of  Germany ’s secure
parliament buildings in Berlin was found dead late yesterday,
police said.  The man, identified as a police officer who worked in the
lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, was found with a
gunshot wound to the head in Berlin’s Kaulsdorf district about
an hour after he fled the Deutsche Post AG branch with cash,
police said in a  statement  on their website.  A bag of money and a paper mask worn by the assailant were
found with the body, the statement said, adding that it was
believed the man had committed suicide. The man entered the bank
at about 7 p.m. yesterday and struck a 42-year-old female
employee on the back of the head with a pistol, wounding her.  “The motive for the crime is currently attributed to
problems in the personal life” of the suspect, the police said.
“The dead man’s membership in the Bundestag police explains his
unhindered access to a branch not accessible by the public.”  The robbery took place in a secure modern complex abutting
the Reichstag building in central Berlin. The body was found by
passersby on a walking path at Berlin’s Butzer See lake, about
17 kilometers (11 miles) to the east. Police had been searching
the Bundestag complex for the man until late in the evening
without success.  To contact the reporter on this story:
