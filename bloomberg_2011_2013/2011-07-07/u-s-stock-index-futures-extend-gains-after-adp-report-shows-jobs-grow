U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains after an industry report showed companies added more jobs
than forecast in June, bolstering confidence in the economic
recovery.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September climbed 0.7 percent to 1,345.9 at 8:16 a.m. in  New
York . Dow Jones Industrial Average futures increased 69 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 12,638.  Companies in the U.S. added 157,000 workers to their
payrolls in June, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services. The median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for an advance of 70,000. Forecasts of the
36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg ranged from 40,000 to
175,000. The data comes before the government’s June payrolls
report tomorrow.  U.S. stocks rose yesterday, posting their sixth advance in
seven days, as gains in transportation and consumer-staple
companies overshadowed a slowdown in service-industry growth and
 China ’s interest-rate increase.  The S&P 500 climbed 5.6 percent last week, its biggest
weekly advance since July 2009. The gain helped the  S&P 500 
erase about 75 percent of the decline suffered since reaching
its high for the year on April 29. Through June 24, U.S.
equities had fallen for seven of the previous eight weeks on
concern that the European debt crisis would spread and the  U.S.
economy  slow. The index has gained 6.5 percent for the year,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
