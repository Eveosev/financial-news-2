The euro advanced against most of its
16 major counterparts tracked by Bloomberg amid speculation
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet will signal
further rate increases at a press conference today.  The 17-member common currency snapped two days of declines
versus the dollar before the ECB announces its interest-rate
decision at 1:45 p.m. in  Frankfurt . All 55 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News expect the central bank to raise its benchmark
rate by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent to contain price
pressures even as  Greece  threatens to become the euro areaâ€™s
first sovereign default. Consumer-price inflation rose 2.7
percent from a year earlier in June.  The euro appreciated 0.2 percent to $1.4343 as of 7:57 a.m.
in  London . It also advanced 0.2 percent to 116.07 yen and added
0.3 percent to 89.75 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
