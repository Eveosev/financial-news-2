Quarterback Kerry Collins, who led
the  New York Giants  to a Super Bowl berth a decade ago, retired
after a 16-year National Football League career with five teams.  Collins, 38, made the announcement in an e-mailed statement
through his agent, David Dunn. The former  Penn State University 
quarterback and two-time Pro Bowl selection played for the
Giants from 1999 to 2003, losing to the Baltimore Ravens 34-7 in
the Super Bowl after the 2000 season.  “I have decided that while my desire to compete on Sundays
is still and always will be there, my willingness to commit to
the preparation necessary to play another season has waned to a
level that I feel is no longer adequate to meet the demands of
the position,” Collins said.  He was selected by the  Carolina Panthers  with the No. 5
pick in 1995, the first draft choice in franchise history. He
was 81-96 in 177 starts with the Panthers, New Orleans Saints,
Giants, Oakland Raiders and  Tennessee  Titans, throwing for 206
touchdowns and 195 interceptions.  Last season with Tennessee, Collins was 2-5 as a starter,
throwing for 14 touchdowns and eight interceptions. He finished
second for his career among active quarterbacks with 40,441
yards passing, trailing  Peyton Manning  of the Indianapolis
Colts.  Collins went 12-4 as a starter with the Giants in 2000,
When they won the National Football Conference East. He had five
touchdown passes in a 41-0 victory over the  Minnesota Vikings  in
the NFC Championship Game before struggling in the  Super Bowl ,
throwing four interceptions and posting a 7.1 passer rating.  Collins said he was grateful to have played with and been
coached by “some of the true patriarchs of the modern game.”
He mentioned coach Joe Paterno of Penn State and owners
Wellington Mara of the Giants, Bud Adams of the Titans and Al Davis of the Oakland Raiders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
