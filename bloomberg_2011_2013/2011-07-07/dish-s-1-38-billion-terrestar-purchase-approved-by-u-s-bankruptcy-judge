Dish Network Corp. (DISH) ’s $1.38 billion
agreement to buy TerreStar Networks Inc. out of bankruptcy won
court approval after no rival bids emerged for the mobile-
communications company.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane at a hearing today in New
York approved Reston, Virginia-based TerreStar’s sale to Dish,
the second-largest U.S. satellite-television provider.  The TerreStar purchase follows agreements by  Charlie Ergen ,
Englewood, Colorado-based Dish’s chairman, to buy two other
companies out of bankruptcy: video-rental chain Blockbuster Inc.
and DBSD North America Inc., a satellite-communications
provider.  TerreStar, which provides mobile communications through a
satellite network, filed for bankruptcy last year with a plan
that would have given an ownership stake to  EchoStar Corp. (SATS) ,
where Ergen, 58, is also chairman. A majority of the voting
power of Dish and EchoStar is owned by Ergen or his family
trusts.  TerreStar dropped the EchoStar-backed plan when it
couldn’t get creditor support and put itself up for sale. It
reached the deal with Dish subject to higher bids. The planned
auction was called off after no other suitors met the bid
deadline, TerreStar said in a court filing.  Ergen is interested in TerreStar’s wireless spectrum, which
he can combine with spectrum acquired in the DBSD bankruptcy,
Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG LLC in  New York , said in a
June 28 note. Wireless spectrum is rising in value as
smartphones become more popular, according to Piecyk.  The case is In re TerreStar Networks Inc., 10-15446,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
