U.S. regulators will oversee more
foreign-owned than domestic banks under Dodd-Frank Act rules
governing financial institutions deemed systemically important.  About 100 foreign-owned banks and financial companies with
operations in the U.S. will be subject to rules designed to
protect the  U.S. economy  from the failure of large firms,
according to a Bloomberg Government study. Just 26 U.S.-owned
banks and financial firms meet the criteria.  “Foreign-owned banks will be disproportionately affected
by the law’s most stringent requirements,” said Cady North, the
Bloomberg Government analyst who wrote the report. The entire
report can be found at Bloomberg Government’s website,
 http://www.bgov.com .  Among the rules non-U.S. banks may have to follow are the
so-called Volcker rule, which restricts proprietary trading; a
requirement to file a resolution plan, or “living will,” with
U.S. regulators outlining how to break up the company in case of
failure; and  capital requirements  that exclude trust-preferred
securities from being considered  Tier 1 capital .  Bank holding companies owned by firms outside the U.S. that
are expected to fall under Dodd-Frank rules include: Taunus
Corp., owned by Frankfurt-based  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ; HSBC North
America Holdings Inc., owned by London-based  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ;
and TD Bank US Holding Company, owned by Toronto-based Toronto-
Dominion Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
