Iran must not lose its share of the
crude market and should be wary of  Saudi Arabia ’s attempts to
sell more of its oil to Asian refineries,  Shargh  reported,
citing Iran’s OPEC Governor Mohammad Ali Khatibi.  Iran’s failure to boost output capacity to 5 million
barrels a day by the end of 2010 has compromised its influence
in the oil market, Khatibi said in an interview with the Tehran-
based newspaper. The nation’s official capacity is 4 million
barrels a day.  Saudi Arabia “has reached out” to many potential buyers
of crude, particularly in  Asia , he said. “It would have been
good for Iran to anticipate Saudi Arabia’s game and not at any
cost allow for this country and its OPEC and non-OPEC allies to
set the rules of the game,” he said in the article today. Saudi
Arabia and  Iran  are the first- and second-biggest producers in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
