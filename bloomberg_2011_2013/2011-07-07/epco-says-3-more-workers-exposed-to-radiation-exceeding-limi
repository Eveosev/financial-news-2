Tokyo  Electric Power Co. said three
more workers at its crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power
plant were exposed to radiation exceeding the government’s
annual limit.  The male workers, in their 20s, were exposed to levels
beyond the limit of 250 millisieverts, Junichi Matsumoto, a
general manager at the utility known as Tepco, told reporters in
Tokyo today. Medical examinations showed the exposure had no
immediate impact on their health, he said.  Under Tepco rules, a worker exposed to more than 170
millisieverts will be deployed to the plant’s radiation- and
quake-proof operation center, Hajime Motojuku, a spokesman for
the utility, said by phone. A worker exposed to more than 200
millisieverts will be sent to other Tepco plants or offices,
according to Motojuku.  To contact the reporter on this story:
