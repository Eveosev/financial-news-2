Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) ,  India ’s biggest
mobile-phone company, formed two separate business units to
serve retail and corporate customers of the company in India and
 South Asia .  One unit will serve corporate clients and the other will
deal with consumers of Bharti’s retail offerings such as mobile
phone and digital television services. The new structure will
come into effect from Aug. 1 and is aimed at improving
efficiency and reducing complexity, according to an e-mailed
statement from the New Delhi-based company today.  Phone companies in India are seeking to streamline
operations and cut costs amid low call rates and rising
competition in the world’s second-largest market for wireless
services. The start of number portability and new entrants such
as  Telenor ASA (TEL)  and NTT DoCoMo Inc. have heightened rivalries.  “Sales from mobile services form about 78 percent of the
company’s revenues, and forming a business unit to serve
corporate clients may help them gain more customers on the
enterprise side,” said Siddharth Deshmukh, an analyst at
Networth Stock Broking Ltd. in Mumbai.  Bharti rose 3.8 percent, the most since May 9, to 398
rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of trading in Mumbai. The stock
was the best performer on the benchmark Bombay Stock Exchange
Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
