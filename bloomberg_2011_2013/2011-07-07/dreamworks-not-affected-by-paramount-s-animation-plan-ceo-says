DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA)  Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey Katzenberg said the film studio won’t
be affected by Paramount Pictures’ plan to start a competing
animation department.  Katzenberg spoke to reporters today at an Allen & Co.
conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.  Viacom Inc. (VIA/B) ’s Paramount said yesterday it will create an
animation unit that plans to release its first title in 2014.
DreamWorks, based in Glendale,  California , releases its pictures
through Paramount in a distribution deal that expires at the end
of 2012.  Katzenberg also said DreamWorks isn’t for sale and that the
company has “great opportunities” ahead of it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
