The euro stemmed a two-day drop
versus the dollar as European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet  signaled more interest-rate increases after raising the
benchmark to 1.5 percent.  The 17-member currency gained after Trichet said policy
makers loosened collateral rules for Portuguese bonds to support
local banks. The dollar dropped against most of its major
counterparts as a report showed U.S. companies added more
workers in June than economists forecast, damping demand for
haven assets before the government’s payrolls figures tomorrow.  Trichet’s comments “helped alleviate some concern about
funding for Portuguese banks,” said  Omer Esiner , chief market
analyst in  Washington  at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., a
currency brokerage. “That’s why we’re seeing the euro firmer
across the board.”  The euro appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.4364 at 5 p.m. in
 New York , from $1.4319 yesterday, after touching $1.4221, the
lowest level since June 27. The euro appreciated 0.7 percent to
116.70 yen, from 115.86. The dollar increased 0.4 percent to
81.25 yen, from 80.91.  ECB policy makers increased the target lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point, as forecast by 55 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  “Our monetary-policy stance remains accommodative,”
Trichet said at a press conference in  Frankfurt . “It is
essential recent price developments do not give rise to broad-
based inflation pressures over the medium term.”  Collateral Rules  Trichet said the ECB will suspend its minimum credit-rating
threshold on Portuguese bonds after Moody’s Investors Service
lowered the nation’s debt to junk. The suspension will be
maintained “until further notice,” he said. This follows the
waiving of minimum thresholds for Greek and Irish bonds.  Suspending the collateral rules for  Portugal  “does show
that the ECB is willing to maintain liquidity in the market, yet
it does expose the ECB to risks should we see haircuts” on
defaulted bonds, said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy
at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in London. “They are
trying to be ahead of the game if Portugal’s bonds receive a
default rating.”  The yen and Swiss franc were the biggest losers among major
currencies as stocks and commodities rallied on U.S. employment
reports, boosting demand for the South African rand,  Brazil ’s
real and the Canadian dollar.  Weaker Franc  The franc dropped 0.6 percent to 84.43 centimes versus the
dollar and fell 0.9 percent to 1.2128 against the euro. In times
of distress, the currency benefits from  Switzerland ’s role as a
stable, neutral financial center.  U.S. companies added 157,000 workers last month, ADP
Employer Services reported today, surpassing the 70,000 forecast
by 36 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Initial jobless
claims fell by 14,000 to 418,000 in the week ended July 2, the
Labor Department said today.  Nonfarm payrolls increased by 105,000 in June after an
advance of 54,000 in the prior month, according to the median
estimate of 85 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before
tomorrow’s payrolls report from the Labor Department. The
 unemployment rate  probably stayed at 9.1 percent.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 1.1 percent, and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials added 1.8
percent. Crude oil rallied 2.2 percent to $98.75 a barrel in New
York trading.  Brazilian Real  The Brazilian real was the best performer against the
dollar among the 16 most-traded currencies, rising 1 percent to
1.5538 versus the U.S. currency.  Canada ’s dollar increased for
the first time in four days, advancing 0.7 percent to 95.87
cents against the greenback. The U.S. is Canada’s biggest trade
partner.  The pound stayed weaker against the dollar after the  Bank
of England  kept its target lending rate at a record low 0.5
percent, as forecast by all 51 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. The central bank also held its bond-purchase program at
200 billion pounds ($320 billion).  Sterling dropped 0.2 percent to $1.5974 after falling last
week to $1.5911, the lowest level since Jan. 31. The pound
declined 0.5 percent to 89.91 pence per euro.  Australia ’s dollar rose as employers added more jobs in
June than economists forecast. The number of people employed in
Australia rose by 23,400, the statistics bureau said today,
higher than the median estimate for a 15,000 increase in a
Bloomberg News survey. The jobless rate held at 4.9 percent.  The Aussie climbed 0.7 percent to $1.0776 and advanced 1.1
percent to 87.55 yen.  New Zealand ’s dollar rose 0.8 percent to
83.34 U.S. cents after touching a record 83.44. It gained 1.2
percent to 67.72 yen.  Uganda’s shilling fell for a third day as retailers in the
capital,  Kampala , struck over accelerating inflation and a
weakening currency. The shilling depreciated 0.9 percent to
2,595 per dollar, extending its loss this year to 11 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
