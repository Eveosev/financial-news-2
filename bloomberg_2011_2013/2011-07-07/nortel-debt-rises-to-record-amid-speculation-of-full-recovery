Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ)  bonds rose to a
record amid speculation holders of the bankrupt company’s debt
may recover all their principal and back interest following a
sale of the telecommunications-equipment maker’s patents.  Nortel’s $450 million of 10.75 percent bonds that mature in
July 2016 rose 1.9 cents to 108.9 cents on the dollar, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. That’s the highest close since
the Mississauga, Ontario-based-based company sold the debt in
January 2008.  Speculation that the proceeds from the $4.5 billion patent
sale could entitle debt holders to both their principal and any
interest accrued since Nortel filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in January 2009, may be lifting the bonds, said
Andrew Gottesman, a New York-based vice president with
SecondMarket Inc., a private exchange of illiquid assets such as
bankruptcy debt.  “It may mean they’re expecting something in a bankruptcy
case that is atypical,” Gottesman said today in a telephone
interview. “You only get post-petition interest when there is
money for everybody.”  The bonds climbed July 1 after Cupertino, California-based
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and other technology industry rivals outbid  Google
Inc. (GOOG) , exceeding investor estimates for the more than 6,000
patents and applications related to wireless and Internet
technology. Google originally offered $900 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
