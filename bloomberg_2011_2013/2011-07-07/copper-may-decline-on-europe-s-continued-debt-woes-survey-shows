Copper may fall on speculation that
the European debt crisis won’t be easily resolved.  Ten of 13 analysts, investors and traders surveyed by
Bloomberg, or 77 percent, said prices will fall next week. Two
predicted a gain and one forecast little change. Copper for
three-month delivery was up 3.2 percent for this week at
$9,746.50 a metric ton by 5:53 p.m. yesterday on the London
Metal Exchange.  The euro touched a two-week low against the dollar
yesterday amid concern that  Greece  may become the region’s first
default, offsetting signals for more interest-rate increases
from the  European Central Bank . European Union finance ministers
will meet in Brussels on July 11. Bonds in  Europe ’s most-
indebted nations tumbled July 6 after  Portugal  was downgraded to
junk status, adding to concern the area’s debt woes will
continue to ripple beyond Greece.  “We’re going to see a euro-dollar that might still be
under pressure, because the Greek situation is still surrounded
by a lot of uncertainty,” Christin Tuxen, an analyst at Danske
Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said July 6.  The red bars on the attached chart are derived by
subtracting bearish forecasts from bullish estimates, with
readings below zero signaling the majority of respondents expect
a decline. The green line shows the copper price. The survey
data shown are as of July 1.  The weekly copper survey has forecast prices accurately in
69 of the past 144 weeks, or 48 percent of the time.  This week’s survey results: Bullish: 2 Bearish: 10 Hold: 1  To contact the reporter on this story:
