KenolKobil Ltd., a Kenyan fuel
retailer with operations in nine African countries, fell from a
more than four-year high as it reached a level that is a signal
to technical analysts a stock is poised to drop.  The shares retreated 0.4 percent to 11.95 shillings by the
3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi. The stock closed at 12
shillings on July 4, the highest since January 2007. It was
unchanged yesterday and on July 5.  KenolKobil’s 14-day relative strength index closed trading
at 90.14 yesterday. A reading above 70 is a sign the stock is
likely to fall. The RSI has been above 70 since June 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Right now it is stabilizing in anticipation of the half-
year earnings announcement,” Gregory Waweru, an analyst at
Nairobi-based Kestrel Capital East Africa Ltd., said in a phone
interview today. The company will release results on July 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
