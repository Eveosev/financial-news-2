Mark Zuckerberg  was the big one that
got away.  Boston venture capitalists declined to fund the founder of
Facebook, the world’s most-popular social networking service,
when he sought money to expand his startup in 2004. Zuckerberg’s
move that year to  Palo Alto , California, from his Harvard
University dorm was a wakeup call for New England firms, which
have lost market share to Silicon Valley and New York in the
past seven years, says Michael Greeley, a general partner at
Flybridge Capital Partners.  “There was a little bit of shock that we missed it, as a
community,” Greeley, a board member of the  National Venture
Capital Association , said in an interview. Since then,  Boston 
“really rallied around ‘how do you let these kids know that the
state is open for business and a great place to start
companies?’ Sort of a post-Facebook echo boom effect. Zuckerberg
should never have left.”  Greeley’s firm in 2009 started Stay in MA, one of several
programs designed to entice young entrepreneurs to stay in the
region. Incubators such as Dogpatch Labs, started by Polaris
Venture Partners, and TechStars Boston offer free space to
aspiring entrepreneurs, and angel investors are scouting
campuses in search of the next Zuckerberg, Greeley said. Firms
that had moved to the suburban venture capital centers are
returning to the city to be closer to the universities.  Falling Behind  Boston, the birthplace of modern venture capitalism,
accounted for 11 percent of U.S. venture investments last year,
down from 15 percent in 2003. Silicon Valley firms increased
their share to 39 percent from 34 percent in the same period.
Valley firms raised almost three times as much money as their
New England counterparts in the past five years, and almost
seven times as much in the first quarter of this year.  As a result, Boston missed out on much of the recent surge
in initial public offerings, which was driven in part by
Internet startups. Of $6.83 billion in venture-backed IPOs in
the first half of this year,  Massachusetts  accounted for just
$209 million, or about 3 percent, compared with 11 percent on
average for the past decade, the NVCA said this week.  Part of the reason, says Bill Aulet, managing director at
the MIT entrepreneurship center, is that Boston’s venture
capitalists have traditionally focused on industries that make
“real products” such as software, telecommunications, material
sciences and biotechnology.  Route 128  Biotechnology startups have been the biggest recipient of
Boston venture capital, accounting for about a third of
investments in the region over the past five years. MIT
president Susan Hockfield, a neuroscientist, said in her 2005
inaugural address that she wanted the school to lead in that
field.  Many of the region’s venture firms are based near Route
128, a highway that connects Boston’s western suburbs in a semi-
circle and was once nicknamed America’s Technology Highway. The
area is still home to companies such as Raytheon Co., the
biggest maker of missiles,  Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) , the
largest maker of laboratory instruments, and Biogen Idec Inc.,
the world’s largest maker of multiple sclerosis medicines.  Being outside of the city made it harder for firms to stay
in touch with students, said Kate Castle, vice president of
marketing at Boston-based Flybridge and a board member of the
MIT Enterprise Forum Cambridge, which helps connect technology
entrepreneurs.  “The T doesn’t go out there,” Castle said, referring to
the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, operator of the
public transportation system in the area. Students are “not
going to rent a car.”  ‘Everyone Laughed’  To be closer to the universities, at least seven firms have
opened offices in Cambridge in the past two years and one,
Charles River Ventures, is planning to do so. Spark Capital, one
of the early investors in Twitter and Tumblr, started in
downtown Boston six years ago.  “We were on Newbury Street right in Back Bay, and everyone
kind of laughed at us,” said Alex Finkelstein, 35, a general
partner who’s been with Spark since the beginning. Now, “we’re
seeing more of these old-school firms moving from 128 into
Boston or Cambridge because that’s where the entrepreneurs
are.”  Zuckerberg’s Facebook tried to raise money in the Boston
area in 2004 and was turned down by Battery Ventures, a firm in
the suburb of Waltham that helped start companies such as Akamai
Technologies Inc., which sells server space that helps websites
load faster, and wireless communications provider MetroPCS
Communications Inc.  Turning Down Facebook  Facebook is currently valued at $82.4 billion on SharesPost
Inc., a secondary exchange for shares of private companies. The
company may seek an IPO in the first quarter of 2012 with a
valuation as high as $100 billion, CNBC reported June 13, citing
people familiar with the matter.  “It’s not Boston’s historical strength,” Sunil Dhaliwal,
a general partner at Battery, said about the consumer Internet
business. “Relative to other geographies, we’ve been playing
catch-up.”  Part of the reason Facebook didn’t find funding in Boston,
and that area firms missed out on the social networking boom, is
because many didn’t grasp its significance, said Howard Anderson, 66, a senior lecturer at the  MIT Sloan School of
Management  and co-founder of Battery Ventures. The average angel
investor in Boston is about 55 years old. In  California , it’s
32, he said.  ‘Generational Issue’  “It became a generational issue. You couldn’t really
understand social networking here,” he said. “To understand
things like Facebook, you have to be 19 to 24 years old. If
you’re 56, you don’t quite get it.”  Battery, formed in 1983 in Boston, used to find technology
deals because partners would hang around MIT’s campus in
Cambridge, Anderson said. The firm moved to Wellesley and then
to Waltham so it could have enough space to help set up
entrepreneurs and their businesses, said Amy Grady, a Battery
spokeswoman.  Many Boston-area venture capitalists also cringe at the
implied valuations of some Internet companies. At its current
valuation, Facebook would be worth 59 percent more than  Ford
Motor Co. (F) , the second-largest U.S. automaker, and more than
twice as much as BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest asset
manager.  Groupon Inc., the online coupon website, has an implied
valuation of $10.4 billion, according to SharesPost, on revenue
of $713 million last year. In comparison, discount retailer
Dollar Tree Inc. has a market value of $8.5 billion and sales of
$5.9 billion.  ‘Getting Too Excited’  “They’re getting too excited,” Anderson said of the
investors in the companies. “For people who say this is not a
bubble, I reminded them that 10 years ago they were saying,
‘it’s different this time.’ And it never was.”  Fifty-three Internet companies have filed for U.S. IPOs so
far this year, the most since 164 companies in the industry
announced plans for initial offerings in the U.S. during all of
2000, data compiled by Bloomberg show. By contrast, just three
biotech companies have filed for IPOs, down from 46 in all of
2000.  LinkedIn Corp., based in  Mountain View , California, saw its
shares more than double in value on May 19, their first day of
trading. The stock has been little changed since then. Oakland,
California-based Pandora Media Inc. has gained 15 percent from
its IPO price of $16.  Greylock Moves West  Greylock Partners , founded in 1965, two years ago moved its
headquarters to  Menlo Park , California, from Waltham, where it
was based for 44 years. The firm, which has backed companies
such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., the drugmaker whose first
medicine was approved this year, moved its East Coast office to
Cambridge last year.  Greylock was an early backer of LinkedIn, Facebook and
Pandora and a recent investor in Groupon, whose IPO may value
the company at as much as $25 billion, people familiar with the
matter said in March. Greylock general partner David Sze led the
firm’s investment in Facebook in 2006.  Apart from Silicon Valley,  New York  has been among the
biggest beneficiaries. It is home to consumer Internet start-ups
such as Gilt Groupe Inc., Foursquare Labs Inc., which lets
people use the Internet to broadcast their whereabouts, and
Tumblr Inc., a microblogging site.  “It’s amazing what’s going on there,” said Aulet, who
helps connect aspiring entrepreneurs at the MIT. “You can just
feel the excitement in the air.”  New York’s Gain  Venture investments in New York metro-area companies
totaled $580 million in this year’s first quarter, equal to 10
percent of the total nationwide, compared with $639 million in
the New England region, which had an 11 percent market share.
New York’s share was about half of Boston’s seven years ago.  Flybridge’s Greeley said there’s a “historic frustration”
that schools like MIT and Harvard educate students only to see
them leave. Cambridge has the highest number of Ph.D.s per
capita in the  United States , according to the most recent data
available from the U.S. Census Bureau.  “We tend to focus on things that are hard and novel,”
Greeley said. “The novelty of Facebook was the social outlet,
it wasn’t the technical insights.”  There’s some evidence Boston firms are getting back into
the game. Spark, founded by Todd Dagres, a former partner at
Battery, Santo Politi, a partner at Charles River Ventures, and
Paul Conway, a former Charles River finance chief, has been
among the most visible investors in social media since it was
started in 2005. Bijan Sabet, who led Spark’s investments in
Twitter and Tumblr, also sits on Twitter’s board.  Return to Harvard  General Catalyst Partners in Cambridge is backing Kayak,
the seven-year-old online travel management company that has
registered for a $50 million IPO.  Andrew McCollum, who was part of the original Facebook team
at Harvard until he left in 2006, said there is much more
excitement now about entrepreneurship at the school and in the
city than when he left.  “It was just really amazing, the difference in the
environment and enthusiasm,” said McCollum, 27, who returned to
Boston last year and is now entrepreneur-in-residence at
Flybridge. “I saw tons of people, and they told me that CS50,
the intro computer science class, is now one of the biggest
courses at the school. It’s taught in Sanders Theater, the
biggest lecture hall on campus.”  Finkelstein says people who were skeptical of Spark’s
investments in Tumblr and Twitter a few years ago don’t laugh
now. Twitter is raising funding that values the company at about
$7 billion, a person familiar with the matter said this week.
That’s almost twice as much as the company was worth in December
when it received a $200 million investment led by Kleiner
Perkins Caufield & Byers.  “We invested in Tumblr when it was a one-person company,
Twitter when it was a 15-person company,” he said. “A lot of
people thought we were crazy for those investments when we made
them, and now the valuations speak for themselves.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
