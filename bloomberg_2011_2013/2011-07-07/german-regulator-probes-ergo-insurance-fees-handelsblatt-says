Germany ’s financial regulator Bafin
is conducting an inquiry over Ergo Versicherungsgruppe AG
charges for insurance contracts,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing
an unidentified spokeswoman for the regulator.  Bafin has urged Ergo to clarify circumstances related to
charges for so-called Riester insurance contracts, the newspaper
said in a preview of an article to be published in tomorrow’s
edition.  Bafin spokesman Sven Gebauer couldn’t be reached for
comment. Ergo spokeswoman Alexandra Klemme said the company has
already responded to Bafin’s requests for information and
remains “in regular contact” with the regulator. Klemme
declined to become more specific.  To contact the reporter on this story:
