U.S. Gulf crudes strengthened as the
gap between West Texas Intermediate and Brent widened a third
consecutive day.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart increased
$2.20 to $19.17 a barrel as of 12:42 p.m. in  New York . When
Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur
U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced against
the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium increased $2.65 to $16.40 a
barrel over West Texas Intermediate as of 11:57 a.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
largest single-day price increase since March 9.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained $2.40, the largest single-day
price rise for that grade since Feb. 14, to $16.25 over the
benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added $1.85 to $10.25 a barrel, while Poseidon gained
$1.80 to $10 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium widened $2.25 to $9 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount narrowed 10 cents to
$1.10. Thunder Horse’s premium increased $2.90 to $16.25.  The premium for Syncrude widened 50 cents to $8.75.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed $1 to $20 a
barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
