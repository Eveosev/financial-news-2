Crude oil futures pared their gains
after a U.S. government report showed a smaller-than-expected
decrease in inventories.  Supplies fell 889,000 barrels to 358.6 million in the week
ended July 1, the Energy Department said today in a weekly
report. Inventories were forecast to decrease by 2.5 million
barrels, according to the median of 15 analyst estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Crude oil for August delivery rose $2.24, or 2.3 percent,
to $98.89 a barrel at 11:02 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Oil traded at $99.27 a barrel before the release of
the report at 11 a.m. in Washington, a day later than usual
because of the U.S. Independence Day holiday.  Futures rose earlier after a report showed American
companies added more workers than forecast in June. Data from
ADP Employer Services showed a 157,000 gain in the number
employed by businesses last month. An advance of 70,000 was
projected, according to the median forecast by Bloomberg News.  “The economic data is better than expected,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in  St. Louis . “It appears that economists were too
negative about the prospects for growth.”  U.S. initial jobless claims fell by 14,000 to 418,000 in
the week ended July 2, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a drop to 420,000.  Morgan Stanley said it is bullish on oil in the second half
of 2011 as production capacity falls. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
reiterated its long-trading recommendation for Brent oil futures
traded in  London .  “We continue to expect that oil demand growth fueled by
moderate economic growth expectations will be sufficient to draw
down crude oil inventories,” Goldman analysts led by London-
based Jeffrey Currie said in a report dated today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
