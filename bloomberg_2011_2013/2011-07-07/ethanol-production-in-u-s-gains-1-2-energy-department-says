Ethanol production in the U.S.
increased 1.2 percent to 904,000 barrels a day last week,
according to the Energy Department.  Stockpiles plunged 4.8 percent to 18.6 million barrels,
enough supply for 21.6 days, the department said. Thatâ€™s the
biggest decline since Aug. 20, 2010, leaving stocks at the
lowest level since Jan. 14.  Production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol
rose 1.7 percent to a record 5.26 million barrels a day.
Refiners receive a 45-cent tax credit for every gallon of
ethanol blended into the motor fuel.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery jumped 3.6 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.615 a gallon at 11:29 a.m. New York time on
the Chicago Board of Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
