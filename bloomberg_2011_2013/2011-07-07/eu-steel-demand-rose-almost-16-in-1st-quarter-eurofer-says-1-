European Union apparent steel demand
rose almost 16 percent in the first quarter, compared with a
year earlier, industry group Eurofer said.  Apparent demand based on deliveries plus imports will rise
7.7 percent for the year to 161 million metric tons, the highest
since 2008, the Brussels-based Eurofer said in an e-mailed
statement today. Steel output will rise 6 percent over the same
period, Eurofer said.  “Demand-side fundamentals of the EU steel market are
looking rather positive,” said Gordon Moffat, director general
of Eurofer. “Real consumption growth is the key driver and
stocks in the distribution chain are seen remaining balanced
with demand.”  Apparent demand surpassed the 15 percent increase in real
demand, signaling forward buying by steel purchasers,
“apparently more so by the participants in the steel
distribution chain than by final consumers,” Eurofer said.
Inventories are “well-balanced” with demand, partly due to
credit restrictions, it said.  Real steel consumption is forecast to increase 6.6 percent
this year and 3.9 percent in 2012, it said.  Steel output rose 12 percent in the first quarter, boosted
by milder weather than a year earlier, Eurofer said.
Construction accounts for 27 percent of EU steel demand, the
largest sector, Eurofer said.  “The strength of first quarter EU steel-using industries
has clearly surprised on the upside,” the group said. ‘All
sectors except shipbuilding posted higher-than-expected growth
in output.”  Editors: Claudia Carpenter, Patrick McKiernan  To contact the reporter on this story:
