Mercuria Energy Trading SA failed to
buy  North Sea  Forties crude at a higher price. Petraco Oil Co.
sought to sell Russian Urals without success.  North Sea  Mercuria was unable to buy one shipment of Forties for July
23 to July 29 loading at 35 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring
the Platts trading window. Yesterday, Trafigura Beheer BV sold
one shipment of Forties for July 19 to July 21 loading to Royal
Dutch Shell Plc at a premium of 15 cents.  Reported North Sea market trading typically occurs during
the Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before
the window, Forties loading in 10 to 21 days was 25 cents more
than Dated Brent, unchanged from yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $117.33 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the
window, up from $113.40 yesterday. The September contract was at
$116.89 a barrel, 44 cents less than August.  One cargo of Forties crude was dropped from the July export
program, bringing the total number of shipments for this month
to 23, according to a revised shipping schedule obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The dropped cargo, with the parcel number of F0716, was
previously for loading July 25 to July 27, the plan showed. The
July loading plan originally comprised 18 cargoes of 600,000
barrels. Over the past month, four shipments were deferred to
July from June and two were added.  The Netherlands sold 450,000 barrels of Brent in a tender
under an International Energy Agency stock release program,
according to an official from the agency handling the sales.  Mediterranean/Urals  Petraco failed to sell 80,000 metric tons of Urals for July
17 to July 21 delivered to the Mediterranean at $1.10 a barrel
below Dated Brent, the survey showed. Yesterday Arcadia
Petroleum Ltd. sold one shipment at a discount of $1.05 a
barrel.  No bids or offers were made in northwest Europe. Yesterday
Shell was unable to sell at 65 cents less than Dated Brent for
July 27 to July 31.  Urals was at $1.08 a barrel less than Dated Brent in the
Mediterranean today, the highest since Dec. 7, 2010, while the
discount in northwest Europe was at 70 cents to the benchmark,
the narrowest since Oct. 15, 2010, according to Bloomberg data.  West Africa  Ghana ’s Jubilee oil field may reach peak production in
August or September, a month later than planned, after boosting
output to as much as 80,000 barrels a day since the start of
this month, according to Tullow Oil Plc, the field’s operator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
