New York Yankees reliever  Mariano Rivera  will skip next week’s Major League Baseball All-Star Game
to rest his pitching arm.  Rivera hasn’t pitched the past three games because of
biceps soreness and will be replaced on the American League
roster by Los Angeles Angels rookie reliever Jordan Walden.  Rivera, 41, has 21 saves for the Yankees this season and
ranks second in major league history with 580.  Walden, 23, has a 1-2 record with a 2.95 earned run average
and 19 saves for the Angels.  The All-Star Game is scheduled to be played in Phoenix on
July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
