The Federal Reserve Board will
monitor mortgage servicers as they work to address “significant
deficiencies” in servicing and foreclosure practices.  “We will continue to monitor and assess the corrective
actions taken by the servicers and the holding companies, as
required by the enforcement actions, and take further action
when necessary to address failures,” the Fed’s Washington-based
Board of Governors said in testimony to a House Financial
Services subcommittee today.  The Fed’s testimony provided an overview of actions the
central bank and other regulators took against mortgage
servicing companies in recent years, including  previously
announced  enforcement actions against 14 mortgage servicers in
April.  The Fed said that its enforcement actions will “remain in
place until weaknesses and deficiencies have been corrected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
