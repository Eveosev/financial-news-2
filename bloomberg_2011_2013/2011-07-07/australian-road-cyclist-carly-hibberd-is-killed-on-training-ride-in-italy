Australian cyclist Carly Hibberd died
after being struck by a car during a training ride yesterday in
northern  Italy , Cycling  Australia  said.  Emergency personnel flew to the crash site north of Milan
by helicopter, though they were unable to save the 26-year-old,
the Sydney-based governing body said in a statement.  Hibberd, a former runner who came into cycling through a
talent identification program, moved to Italy in 2009 to pursue
a professional career and joined the Cassina Rizzardi A Style
Fionucci team, based near Como, Italy, this season.  “Carly was following her cycling dream in Italy, doing
what she loved to do and enjoying life,” Cycling Australia
Chief Executive Officer Graham Fredericks said in the  statement .
“Sadly that dream has ended.”  The accident came 12 days before the six-year anniversary
of the death of elite Australian rider Amy Gillett, who was
killed on July 18, 2005, when an out of control car ran into her
and five teammates as they trained for a road race in  Germany .  Hibberd’s death is the third to affect road cycling in as
many months. Belgian racer Wouter Weylandt was killed in a May 9
crash on a descent at the Giro d’Italia, while Spanish rider
Xavier Tondo died May 23 in a domestic accident.  Australian rider  Cadel Evans , who is in second place at the
 Tour de France , expressed his condolences to Hibberd on his
Twitter page.  “I’m very very sorry, I ride on that road too,” Evans
wrote on Twitter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
