The U.S. must raise its debt limit,
the Treasury Department said after Reuters reported that
officials are discussing legal options to stave off default if
Congress fails to amend the ceiling by the Aug. 2 deadline.  “As we have said repeatedly over the past six months,
there is no alternative to raising the debt limit,” Colleen
Murray, a Treasury spokeswoman, said when contacted late
yesterday in the U.S. “The only way to prevent a default crisis
and protect America’s creditworthiness is to enact a timely debt
limit increase, which we remain confident Congress will do.”  A team of Treasury Department officials is studying whether
the government has legal authority to prioritize its debt
payments, CNBC said, citing a report by Reuters that attributed
the information to people familiar with the matter.  Murray didn’t address whether officials are making
contingency plans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
