Cancer, killing 500,000 people a year
in  Southeast Asia , needs to be tackled with unity by the
region’s governments to avoid economic disruption, Association
of Southeast Asian Nations Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan said.  Asean must battle the region’s cancer epidemic given the
chance there will be “ill-prepared health systems, eventually
undermining the region’s economy,” Surin said in notes prepared
for an address in Singapore today.  “As the prevalence of cancer continues to increase, it is
imperative that we mobilize Asean member nations and encourage
them to put in place a strategic, focused cancer-controlled
health care policy,” Surin said.  The regional group is raising awareness of cancer’s growing
toll to galvanize political action to reverse the epidemic.
Asean is beginning a cancer study this year to collect data to
understand disease patterns and their effects on patients and
their families in all 10 member states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
