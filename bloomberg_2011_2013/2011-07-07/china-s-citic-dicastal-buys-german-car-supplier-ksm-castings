Citic Dicastal Wheel Manufacturing
Co. agreed to buy German car part supplier KSM Castings Gruppe,
the Chinese company’s first acquisition outside its home market.  Citic will purchase  Hildesheim, Germany-based  KSM Castings 
from  Cognetas  LLP, a private-equity company, the Chinese company
said in an e-mailed statement today. KSM, which employs about
2,700 people, makes components for automotive engines and
transmissions and is a supplier to  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  and  Daimler AG. (DAI) 
KSM will operate as an independent business unit within Citic,
led by its current  management , the Chinese company said.  Chinese companies have announced the acquisition of 34
companies based in western Europe with a total reported value of
$7.74 billion so far this year, five times as much as last year,
Bloomberg data show. Citic Dicastal is a unit of Beijing-based
Citic Group,  China ’s biggest state-owned investment company.  KSM had sales of 401 million euros ($573 million) for the
fiscal year ended March 31.  The transaction needs approval from competition regulators
and is expected to close later this year, Cognetas said. None of
the companies involved provided a purchase price. Cognetas was
advised by  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  and  White & Case . Rothschild,
 Hengeler Mueller , and Slaughter and May advised Citic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
