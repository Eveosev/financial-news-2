Bangladesh asked for guarantees on
wheat supplies from Ukraine after the government in Kiev
introduced a grain export tax, said Anatoliy Rozgon, head of the
agriculture-markets department at the  Agriculture Ministry .  A tax of 9 percent on Ukraine’s outbound shipments of the
grain came into effect July 1 and will be in place through
December. Last year, domestic food price concerns led the
government of Prime Minister  Mykola Azarov  to restrict grain
exports for almost eight months.  “This probably has to do with the fact that there were
export restrictions,” Rozgon said of the Bangladeshi request,
in a phone interview today. “I think this is only a
formality.”  Bangladesh was offered 100,000 metric tons of wheat from
Ukraine at $365 a ton, Badrul Hassan, the director of
procurement at the South Asian country’s Food Directorate, said
yesterday.  Rozgon declined to comment about the proposed offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
