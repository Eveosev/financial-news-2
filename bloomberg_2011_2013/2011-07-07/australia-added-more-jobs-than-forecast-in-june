Australian employment rebounded in
June on the biggest surge in full-time jobs in three years,
driving up the currency as concern eased that an economic
expansion was faltering.  The number of people employed rose by 23,400, exceeding the
median estimate for a 15,000 increase in a Bloomberg News survey
of 25 economists, a statistics bureau report showed in Sydney
today. The jobless rate held at 4.9 percent. Employment in May
dropped by a revised 500, after an initially reported gain of
7,800, the report also showed.  Australia ’s currency headed for its biggest gain in a week
as traders bet growth will rebound after first-quarter floods
slashed coal production and triggered the economy’s biggest
contraction in two decades.  Reserve Bank  of Australia Governor
Glenn Stevens has kept the overnight cash rate target unchanged
at 4.75 percent since November, as a rising local dollar helped
limit gains in inflation.  “Today’s report certainly sets up the rebound in the
second half,” said Matthew Circosta, an economist at Moody’s
Analytics in Sydney. “This is a boost for domestic demand and
now we’ve got reconstruction from Queensland’s floods and
exports strengthening so we’re looking at a pretty solid
recovery.”  The number of full-time jobs advanced by 59,000 in June,
and part-time employment fell by 35,600, today’s report showed.
Australia’s participation rate, which measures the  labor force 
as a percentage of the population over 15 years old, rose to
65.6 percent in June from a revised 65.5 percent a month
earlier, it showed.  Dollar Rises  The Australian dollar climbed and government bond yields
advanced after the report. The local currency jumped to $1.0754
as of 12:52 p.m. in Sydney, from $1.0697 before the data. The
two-year government bond yield rose to 4.70 percent from 4.65
percent.  The RBA signaled two days ago that the economy is unlikely
to reach its forecast of 4.25 percent growth this year as a
resumption of coal exports from flooded mines takes longer than
expected.  Today’s report showed disruptions from natural disasters
contributed to Australia’s weakest quarterly employment since
the first three months of 2001, when a U.S. recession started.
The Australian labor market lost a net 5,400 jobs in the April-
June period.  Growth Outlook  The government said in its budget papers in May that
economic growth will accelerate to 4 percent in the year to June
30, 2012, from 2.25 percent last fiscal year. The government
also predicted unemployment will fall to 4.5 percent by
mid-2013.  The RBA increased rates by 175 basis points from October
2009 through November to restrain  consumer spending  and contain
inflation. In contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve has held its
benchmark rate near zero since December 2008. That divergence
contributed to about a 24 percent increase in the local dollar
versus the U.S. currency in the past 12 months.  The Australian dollar reached $1.1012 on May 2, the highest
since exchange controls were scrapped in 1983.  Australia’s hiring is being fueled by a resource bonanza as
China and  India , two countries that account for more than a
third of the world’s population, increase demand for minerals
and energy.  Two coal-seam gas projects, expected to cost more than A$30
billion, are proceeding near the Queensland port of Gladstone.
 Santos Ltd. (STO) , Australia’s third-largest oil producer, and BG
Group Plc, the U.K.’s third-biggest gas producer, will start
hiring the first of more than 10,000 construction workers needed
for the two projects later this year.  To contact the reporter for this story:
