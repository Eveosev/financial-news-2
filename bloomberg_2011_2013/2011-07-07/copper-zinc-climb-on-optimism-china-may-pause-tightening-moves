Copper climbed for the seventh time
in eight days as investors trimmed expectations that  China , the
world’s largest user, will further tighten monetary policy after
announcing its third interest rate increase for the year.  Three-month copper on the  London  Metal Exchange gained as
much as 0.6 percent to $9,578 a metric ton, and traded at $9,550
by 3:59 p.m. in  Singapore . Zinc, aluminum and nickel also
climbed, joining a rally in commodities including oil and gold.  “We do not think that Chinese authorities are trying to
significantly slow industrial production but rather ensure a
more sustained growth path,” Credit Suisse Group AG analyst
Stefan Graber wrote in a note to clients today.  Copper for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained as much as 0.8 percent to 71,300 yuan ($11,026)
a ton. Metal on the Comex in  New York  advanced as much as 0.7
percent to $4.3630 a pound.  China announced a quarter-point boost to one-year lending
and deposit rates late yesterday, effective from today. That may
be the last for 2011, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, as the latest manufacturing data suggested the
tightening measures so far were starting to slow growth.  Investors had expected yesterday’s increase in Chinese
 interest rates  and the effect on China’s economic growth will be
“very limited,” according to UBS AG. The central bank may halt
rate increases if inflation in July slows as UBS expects,  Wang
Tao , economist at the bank, said in a report to clients.  China’s manufacturing shrank to the lowest level since
February 2009 while services industries expanded at the
slowest pace in four months in June. Before yesterday’s
announcement, China increased  reserve requirements  12 times and
interest rates four times since the start of last year.  Aluminum in London increased 0.3 percent to $2,564 a ton,
zinc gained 0.3 percent to $2,386 a ton and nickel climbed 0.4
percent to $23,479 a ton. Lead increased 0.2 percent to $2,705 a
ton, while tin fell 0.5 percent to $26,601 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
