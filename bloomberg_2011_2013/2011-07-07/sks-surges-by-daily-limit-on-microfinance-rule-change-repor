SKS Microfinance Ltd. (SKSM)  headed for a
record advance after the Mint reported Indian microfinance
companies will be freed from provincial government laws and
regulated by the nation’s central bank.  The stock surged by the daily 20 percent limit to 411.8
rupees in Mumbai, the steepest advance since its trading debut
in August 2010, and was the best performer on the Bombay Stock
Exchange Mid-Cap Index. The shares have plunged 47 percent this
year before today.  Indian microfinance institutions will be kept outside the
purview of state government legislation and the  Reserve Bank  of
 India  will be given more powers to control the sector, the Mint
reported, citing a draft bill released by the  finance ministry .  The proposed bill needs cabinet and parliament approvals
before it is signed into law, the newspaper said.  The change is positive for SKS given “severe operational
restrictions” under the Andhra Pradesh state laws that seek to
regulate money lending, JPMorgan wrote in a note to clients
today. The brokerage still kept its  “underweight” rating on
the stock, citing “fundamental flaws” in the company’s
business and “expensive valuations.”  Hyderabad-based SKS considers the draft legislation as a
positive that will help ensure orderly growth of the sector,
Chief Financial Officer Dilli Raj said on Bloomberg-UTV.  To contact the reporter on this story:
