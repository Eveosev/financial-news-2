The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development appointed Rintaro Tamaki, Japanese
vice finance minister for international affairs, as deputy
secretary-general, the Paris-based OECD said.  Angel Gurria , secretary-general of the OECD, said Tamaki’s
“hands-on knowledge” of the organization’s policy issues will
help him in the new role. Tamaki will oversee some key areas of
the OECD, including environment, development and taxation as
well as fiscal and financial affairs, according to the
organization.  “His international reputation, experience and skills will
be great assets to help the OECD achieve its mission at this
critical time for the world economy,” Gurria said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday.  The 34-nation OECD, founded in 1961, says on its website it
aims to “to promote policies that will improve the economic and
social well-being of people around the world.” The group says
it recommends “policies designed to make the lives of ordinary
people better.”  Gurria has said that the solution for the Greek debt crisis
will have to involve private creditors and that Italy doesn’t
face a “concrete risk” of a credit-rating downgrade given its
high level of private savings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
