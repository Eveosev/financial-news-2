Guy Wildenstein, an  art dealer  who
also is an elected representative of French citizens overseas,
was charged yesterday with obtaining goods through abuse of
trust,  Agence France-Presse  said today, citing his lawyer.  Artwork missing for about 20 years was found during a
police search of the Wildenstein Institute in Paris in January,
leading to the filing of the charge. Wildenstein, who lives in
New York, is free subject to court supervision, AFP said,
citing his lawyer.  Herve Temime, Wildensteinâ€™s lawyer, did not immediately
respond to calls and emails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
