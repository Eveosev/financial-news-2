Most of the wells at two phases of
 Iran ’s South Pars natural gas field, which were inaugurated over
two years ago, still aren’t operational,  Arman  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  About 75 percent of the wells in the gas field’s phases 9
and 10 are still unable to extract gas, resulting in a loss of
about $6 billion in potential revenue, the Tehran-based
newspaper said.  The 24 wells in the two phases were forecast to produce
about 50 million cubic meters of gas a day, the newspaper said.
The government officially inaugurated the site in 2008, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
