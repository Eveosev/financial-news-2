North and south  Sudan  remain
“diametrically opposed” over how to split the oil that is
mainly produced in the south and refined and exported in the
north, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed diplomats.  The negotiations between the two sides of the country,
which will be partitioned in two days’ time, is “like a poker
game at the moment,” said Barrie Walkley, U.S. Consul General
in Juba, the capital of  Southern Sudan , according to the FT.
“The final cards aren’t on the table,” he said, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
