Zimbabwe is assessing  De Beers ’
historical exploration activities in the nation’s Chiadzwa
diamond fields, Deputy Mines Minister Gift Chimanikire said.  “We have our own committee which we have set up in the
ministry to go through the reports which De Beers used to submit
to government so that we can make our own assessment on what
production levels we can achieve and what they got,”
Chimanikire told Bloomberg in Harare today. “Out of the tons
and tons of ore they exported, data shows us that they only got
287 carats.”  State-controlled  The Herald  newspaper said on its website
today that the government started the probe because while De
Beers explored the fields for eight years before saying it
didn’t find meaningful quantities, other companies are now
mining there profitably, according to the report.  De Beers, the world’s largest diamond company, said it
hasn’t been approached by  Zimbabwe  about an assessment. It’s
confident that “absolutely no wrongdoing” would be found, the
Johannesburg-based company said an e-mailed response to a query
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
