Oil and gas exploration companies in
East Africa face a wave of mergers and acquisitions as larger
companies seek access to new resources,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  said.  Cove Energy Plc,  Afren Plc (AFR) ,  BG Group Plc (BG/) ,  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) 
and  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  have sprung ahead of competitors in
exploring the region, which may yield resources that can be
shipped to Asia as liquefied natural gas, the researchers said.
Citigroup initiated coverage of Cove, active in Mozambique with
a 480 million pound ($767 million) market capitalization, with a
“Buy” recommendation.  Anadarko and BG have so far made the biggest gas
discoveries, equal to about 2.6 billion barrels of oil
equivalent, in the last 18 months across Mozambique and
Tanzania.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  are trying
to expand in East Africa, where Afren says about 500 wells have
been drilled, compared with 1,500 on the west of the continent.  “East Africa could become one of the largest exploration
plays in the next decade,” said Citigroup analysts led by
Michael Alsford in a research note. “We expect a pickup in M&A
activity with the large cap oils and LNG players moving to
obtain a strategic entry in the region and consolidate smaller
players with large acreage positions.”  Cove and Anadarko are seeking to start an LNG plant in
 Mozambique . BG, the U.K.’s third-largest natural gas producer,
said in May it will drill more wells off Tanzania to find enough
reserves for the development of an LNG plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
