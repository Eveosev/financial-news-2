Conwert Immobilien Invest SE (CWI) , an
Austrian company that buys and renovates apartment blocks, may
make a offer for Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg’s real estate
unit, though the bid wouldn’t be “aggressive.”  “The portfolio is too big for us to make a bid alone, so
we would team up with a partner,” Max Hohenberg, a spokesman
for Vienna-based Conwert, said by telephone today. “We would
not be aggressive on the price.”  LBBW is selling its real estate as part of a plan to shrink
its balance sheet following a 5 billion-euro ($7.2 billion)
bailout by the company’s owners, which include the state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg and regional savings banks, during the
financial crisis. The unit, LBBW Immobilien GmbH, owns about
20,000 apartments.  LBBW Immobilien may be valued at about 1.5 billion euros,
Financial Times Deutschland reported in May.  Patrizia Immobilien AG (P1Z) , an Augsburg, Germany-based real-
estate company, is “seriously interested” in buying the
company, spokesman Andreas Menke said today.  Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWNI) ,
based in  Frankfurt , said it may make an offer. The bidding may
start as early as this month, Deutsche Wohnen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
