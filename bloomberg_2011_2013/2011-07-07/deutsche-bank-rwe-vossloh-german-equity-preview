German stocks fell after U.S.
employers added fewer workers than forecast in June and the
jobless rate unexpectedly climbed, increasing concern about the
strength of the world’s biggest economy.  RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-largest utility, dropped 4 percent
after the Financial Times Deutschland reported its supervisory
board may discuss a share sale in August.  Vossloh AG (VOS)  sank 8.2
percent as the railway-equipment maker cut its sales and
operating earnings forecasts.  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  led rising
shares, climbing 0.8 percent.  The DAX lost 0.9 percent to 7,402.73 at the 5:30 p.m. close
in  Frankfurt , reversing an earlier advance of as much as 0.7
percent. The gauge has fallen 0.2 percent this week even as
finance ministers approved an aid payment to  Greece  and the
 European Central Bank  eased collateral rules to help Portugal
access emergency funds. The broader HDAX Index also retreated
0.9 percent today.  “It’s not an easy time for the U.S.,” said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, an equity strategist at Deutsche Postbank AG in
Bonn. “There are more question marks about the dynamic of the
economic recovery and we can expect a correction.”  Last month’s 18,000 increase in U.S. payrolls followed a
25,000 gain in May that was less than half the rise initially
estimated, Labor Department data showed today. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey called for a June gain of
105,000. The  unemployment rate  rose to 9.2 percent, the highest
level this year. Hiring by companies, which excludes government
agencies, was the weakest since May 2010.  German Exports  In Germany, separate data showed exports increased more
than economists forecast in May, adding to signs the sovereign
debt crisis isn’t harming  Europe ’s largest economy.  RWE fell 4 percent to 37.02 euros after the FT Deutschland
cited Chief Executive Officer  Juergen Grossmann  as saying the
board may discuss a stock sale early next month.  EON AG, Germany’s biggest utility, lost 2.4 percent to
19.32 euros as the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat,
passed seven of the eight government bills that underpin
Chancellor Angela Merkel’s plan to exit nuclear power and speed
the transition to renewables.  Vossloh slumped 8.2 percent to 87.60 euros, the biggest
drop since October 2009, after forecasting sales of 1.25 billion
euros ($1.8 billion) in 2011, down from a previous prediction of
1.4 billion euros. Earnings before interest and tax will be as
little as 120 million euros, compared with a previous Ebit
forecast of more than 160 million euros. The company cited
“significantly delayed call-offs of products to be installed in
Chinese high-speed railway lines.”  Metro Downgrade  Metro AG (MEO)  declined 2.6 percent to 39.77 euros, the lowest
price since August 2010, as BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
downgraded Germany’s biggest retailer to “underperform” from
“neutral.”  Deutsche Boerse  gained 0.8 percent to 54.96 euros, adding
to a 2.4 percent increase yesterday following NYSE Euronext
shareholders’ approval of the German stock-exchange operator’s
$9.39 billion takeover of its U.S. counterpart. The stock was
the best performer in the benchmark DAX Index today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
