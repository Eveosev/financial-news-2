Oil rose to a three-week high as a
report showed American companies added more workers than
forecast in June and after U.S. crude supplies fell.  Futures rose 2.1 percent after data from ADP Employer
Services showed a 157,000 gain in the number employed by
businesses last month. An advance of 70,000 was projected,
according to the median forecast by Bloomberg News. U.S. crude
supplies fell 889,000 barrels to 358.6 million last week, the
lowest level since April, an Energy Department report showed.  “We had good news on jobs today, which is more important
than anything else,” said Sean Brodrick, a natural resource
analyst with  Weiss Research  in Jupiter,  Florida . “People in the
energy pits are now looking at sustained economic strength.”  Crude oil for August delivery increased $2.02 to $98.67 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since June 14. Prices have climbed 33 percent in the
past year.  Brent crude oil for August settlement rose $4.97, or 4.4
percent, to end the session at $118.59 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. It was the biggest advance
since May 9.  The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $19.92
to U.S. futures. The difference reached a record $22.29 on June
15, then narrowed when the  International Energy Agency  said June
23 it would release 60 million barrels to the market.  “The market is reverting to where we were before the IEA
announcement,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork
Group Inc. energy advisory company in Villanova,  Pennsylvania .
“It’s further evidence that the move by the IEA was
misguided.”  German Industrial Output  Industrial production in Germany, Europe’s largest economy,
increased more than economists forecast in May, led by rising
output of investment goods such as machines. Production jumped
1.2 percent from April, when it fell a revised 0.8 percent, the
Economy Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists forecast a
gain of 0.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  “The German industrial production numbers are good for
Brent,” said Carl Larry, director of energy derivatives and
research with Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC in New York. “The
strength in  Germany  is outweighing the troubles in some other
European countries like  Portugal .”  U.S. initial jobless claims fell by 14,000 to 418,000 in
the week ended July 2, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a drop to 420,000.  Economic Figures  “The economic data is better than expected,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at Confluence Investment
Management in  St. Louis . “It appears that economists were too
negative about the prospects for growth.”  The U.S. added 105,000 jobs in June, almost double the
54,000 created a month earlier, according to the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey before a Labor Department report
tomorrow. Private hiring climbed 125,000 last month, while the
jobless rate held at 9.1 percent, the survey showed.  “The positive ADP and weekly jobless numbers are raising
hopes that there will be a positive surprise in tomorrow’s
report,” Brodrick said. “Prices are up despite the fact that
the DOE numbers were more bearish than expected.”  A 2.5 million-barrel crude-oil inventory decrease was
projected, according to the median estimate of 15 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Cushing Supplies  Stockpiles of crude at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for West Texas Intermediate oil, the grade traded in  New
York , slipped 460,000 barrels to 37 million last week, the
report showed.  The Energy Department released its weekly report at 11 a.m.
in Washington, a day late because of the Fourth of July holiday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 1.3 percent to
1,356.11 at 3:17 p.m. in New York, and the  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  rose 124.73 points to 12,750.75.  “You are seeing an increased appetite for risk in almost
all of the markets today,” said Todd Horwitz, chief strategist
at Adam Mesh Trading Group in New York. “Everyone is scrambling
to take part.”  Morgan Stanley said it is bullish on oil in the second half
of 2011 as spare production capacity falls.  Brent Premium  Brent’s premium to U.S. crude may widen to at least $40 a
barrel between now and the middle of 2012, according to
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. Increased output in western  Canada 
and the U.S. midcontinent has led to near-record supplies at
Cushing, the bank said in a note yesterday.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. today reiterated its long-trading
recommendation for Brent futures.  “We continue to expect that oil demand growth fueled by
moderate economic growth expectations will be sufficient to draw
down crude oil inventories,” Goldman analysts led by London-
based Jeffrey Currie said in a report dated today.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 663,057
contracts as of 3:18 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 560,028
contracts yesterday, 18 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.52 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
