The euro stayed lower against the
dollar after the  European Central Bank  raised its benchmark rate
by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent.  The euro slipped against nine of 16 major counterparts
tracked by Bloomberg after the decision, which was predicted by
all 55 economists in a Bloomberg survey. ECB President Jean- Claude Trichet will hold a news conference at 2:30 p.m. in
 Frankfurt .  “It’s about what the ECB says about rate hikes going
forward,”  Paul Robson , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in London, said before the
decision. “If they say risks to inflation and growth have moved
to the downside, the euro would be quite vulnerable on that.
Euro-dollar has had a very tight correlation with rate spreads
over the last year and that’s set to continue.”  The euro fell 0.3 percent to $1.4283 at 12:47 p.m. in
 London . It depreciated 0.1 percent to 115.72 yen.  The common currency weakened 0.5 percent after Trichet’s
June 9 news conference, when he signalled today’s rate increase
while damping investor expectations for further moves by
reiterating that inflation will fall below the ECB’s 2 percent
limit next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
