State Bank of Mauritius Ltd. (SBM) , the
country’s second-largest lender by market value, rose to its
highest level in more than five months after announcing an
increase in its final dividend.  The stock advanced 1 rupee, or 1 percent, to 98.5 rupees at
the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis, the capital, the strongest
since Jan. 21.  The lender will pay a final dividend of 3 rupees for the
year through June, it said in a bourse statement released after
the market closed yesterday.  “The 3-rupee final dividend represents a 9 percent
increase from that of last year and is the highest dividend
payout by the lender”, Kishen Nadassen, a senior research
analyst at Port Louis-based Cim Stockbrokers Ltd., said by
phone, estimating the payout will be 2.90 rupees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
