Telefonica SA (TEF) ,  Europe ’s second-
largest phone company, reached an agreement with labor unions to
cut 6,500 jobs in  Spain , where it’s trying to trim costs in
response to increasing competition.  Telefonica, which April 14 said it aimed to reduce the
number of its employees in Spain by about 20 percent in three
years, reached an accord with unions on a new collective
bargaining agreement through 2013, the Madrid-based company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The cost of the job cuts will be borne by the operator,
meaning the state won’t have to pay for the newly unemployed as
it tries to rein in the euro area’s third-largest deficit. In
Spain, workers that are made redundant can claim  unemployment
benefits  for up to two years. Telefonica didn’t disclose how
much the job cuts will cost the company.  Telefonica said it will also link future wages to company
performance and promised to create as many as 680 jobs in the
next few years.  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Cesar Alierta is
slashing Telefonica’s Spanish workforce as he bets on Latin
America’s economic growth to win back investors discouraged by
Spain’s unemployment rate, the highest of the euro countries at
21 percent.  Spain’s weak economy has encouraged customers to look for
cheaper phone tariffs and switch to rival operators including
TeliaSonera AB’s Yoigo unit, France Telecom SA’s Orange and
Jazztel Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
