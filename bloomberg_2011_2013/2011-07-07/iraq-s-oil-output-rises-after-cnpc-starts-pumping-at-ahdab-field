Iraq , holder of the world’s fifth-
largest crude reserves, is pumping more than 2.8 million barrels
a day after production started at the Al-Ahdab oil field, Oil
Minister Abdul Kareem al-Luaibi said.  State-run China National Petroleum Corp. won a $3.5 billion
development contract for Al-Ahdab in November 2008. It was the
first license awarded by Iraq’s government after the U.S.-led
invasion that ousted the regime of  Saddam Hussein  five years
earlier. Iraq has distributed 14 more contracts to international
energy companies since then, including three for developing
natural gas.  “Production levels of crude oil in Iraq exceed 2.8 million
barrels per day after Al-Ahdab oil field started to produce,”
al-Luaibi said in an interview yesterday in  Baghdad . Iraqi
officials estimate Al-Ahdab, in eastern Al-Wasit province, to
contain about 1 billion barrels.  “Output is due to increase further at the end of the
year,” the minister said.  Iraq produced at a rate of 2.63 million barrels a day last
month, Hussain al-Shahristani, the deputy prime minister for
energy affairs, said on June 7.  The Oil Ministry will select 15 international companies, in
addition to all those that participated in two bidding rounds in
2009, to compete in the next auction of energy licenses set for
early next year, al-Luaibi said. Iraq estimates its crude
reserves at 143.1 billion barrels, the fifth-biggest worldwide.  To contact the reporters on this story:
