Hungary is cutting 600 jobs at public
television and radio stations, as well as state news service
MTI,  Index  reported.  Employees being dismissed include award-winning
journalists, producers and, in some cases, the entire staff of
programs created before Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  came to
power last year, said the news website, which is running a list
of those who are dismissed.  The opposition Socialist Party and Lehet Mas a Politika
said in separate statements that the jobs cuts were a cover for
“politically cleansing” public media, Index said.  MTVA, the holding group for public media, denied any
political motivation in selecting employees for dismissal,
saying they were part of a “renewal” of public media, Index
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
