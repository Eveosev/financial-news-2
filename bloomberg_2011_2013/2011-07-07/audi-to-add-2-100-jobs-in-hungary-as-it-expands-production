Volkswagen AG (VOW) â€™s Audi division will
add 2,100 jobs at its unit in Hungary, 300 more than initially
planned, as the carmaker expands production, Audi said today.  The company, which set up its Hungarian subsidiary in 1993,
currently employs more than 6,500 people at its subsidiary in
the western Hungarian city of Gyor, Audi said in a statement.  Audi announced in September it would invest 900 million
euros ($1.3 billion) in Hungary by 2013, creating 1,800 jobs.  Hungary will extend 11.2 billion forint ($61 million) in
state subsidies to Audi for the 900 million-euro investment,
Economy Minister  Gyorgy Matolcsy  said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
