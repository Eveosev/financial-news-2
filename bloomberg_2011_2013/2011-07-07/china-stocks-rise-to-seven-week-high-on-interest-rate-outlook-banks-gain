companies as Credit Suisse Group AG said it expects a “bumpy
landing” for  China’s economy . Kweichow Moutai Co., China’s
biggest producer of white liquor, advanced on speculation
consumer stocks may weather slowing economic growth.  “Concerns still linger that these tightening measures will
lead to a hard landing for the economy,” said  Zhang Ling ,

uncertain where the economy is headed for now.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of

bank has raised  reserve requirements  for lenders 12 times and

with a 20 percent probability of a “hard landing” over the
next 12-18 months, Dong Tao, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said
in a report.  Monetary policy  will remain on a “tightening
bias” for the next 12 months, he said.  PetroChina fell 1.1 percent to 10.94 yuan. Shenhua lost 1.2
percent to 30.70 yuan. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd., the listed

the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists

in May, the most since July 2008, mainly driven by food costs.  Consumer prices may climb 6.2 percent in June and 6 percent
in July, the People’s Daily said today, citing  Ba Shusong , a
researcher at the State Council’s Development Research Center.
The central bank may raise rates once or twice again to curb
inflation, he said, according to the paper.  SAIC, China’s largest carmaker, slid 3 percent to 18.56
yuan. Anhui Conch, the country’s biggest cement maker, fell 2.5
percent to 27.72 yuan. China First Heavy Industries Co., a maker
of equipment used in the mining and energy industries, lost 1.2
percent to 4.77 yuan.  China may reduce investment on seven strategic emerging
industries, including high-speed rail and wind power, on

citing two unidentified persons close to the Communist Party
leadership.  Consumer Staples  A measure of 23 consumer-staples stocks climbed 0.9 percent

highest close since Nov. 29. Wuliangye Yibin Co., China’s
second-biggest maker of white liquor by market value, gained 1.8
percent to 37.15 yuan.  The interest-rate increase may be the last for 2011,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., HSBC Holdings Plc and Bank
of America Merrill Lynch. Nomura Holdings Inc. predicts one
more move, this quarter.  The  MSCI China (MXCN)  Index will rally 20 percent over the next 12
months on increasing prospects for an easing of monetary policy
by the central bank from the end of the third quarter, according
to Deutsche Bank AG. Yesterday’s rate increase moves the country
“closer to the end of the policy tightening cycle,”  Jun Ma ,
Deutsche Bank’s chief China economist, and Wenjie Lu said in a
report dated yesterday.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
