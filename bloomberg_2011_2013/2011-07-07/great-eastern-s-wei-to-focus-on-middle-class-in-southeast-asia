Christopher Brian Wei, group chief
executive officer at  Great Eastern Holdings Ltd. (GE) , said he plans
to focus on the “untapped” middle-class population in Malaysia
and Indonesia, where the company has existing operations. He
said he’s also targeting the upper-middle-class in  Vietnam . He
spoke at a press briefing yesterday.  Great Eastern, the biggest life insurer in  Singapore , is 85
percent-owned by Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp., the nation’s
second-largest lender by market capitalization, according on
data compiled by Bloomberg.  On Indonesia:  “The whole industry is targeting the same sector, which is
the wealthy upper-middle-class that they are selling investment-
linked products to. So we are going to focus on the middle-class
that is largely being ignored by the market. We’re looking at a
differentiated approach to the market place.”  On his chosen markets:  “Malaysia is going to be a very exciting engine of growth
for us.  Indonesia  should offer very attractive growth. Vietnam
has been a wonderful success story. We’re only a year and a half
in and we’re deploying the same discipline that we do in our
mature markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
