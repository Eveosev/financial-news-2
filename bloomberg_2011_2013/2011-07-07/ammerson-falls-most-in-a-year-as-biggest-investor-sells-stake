Hammerson Plc (HMSO) , the U.K.’s third-
largest real estate investment trust, fell the most in more than
a year in London trading after the largest shareholder sold its
entire stake.  Cadillac Fairview, which is owned by the  Ontario Teachers’
Pension Plan , sold its 85.6 million shares in Hammerson at 463
pence apiece, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a statement
today. The New York-based bank was the sole bookrunner on the
deal. Cadillac Fairview held 12 percent of Hammerson’s shares,
according to Bloomberg data.  Hammerson, based in London, fell as much as 5.7 percent and
was down 4.9 percent at 463 pence as of 9:15 a.m. local time.
That’s the biggest drop since May 2010 and cut the year’s gain
to 11 percent.  Cadillac Fairview said after the market closed yesterday
that it would place the shares for sale.  Morgan Bone, a spokesman for Hammerson, declined to comment
when contacted by Bloomberg.  Hammerson said in April it will probably match its 2010
earnings with fewer properties this year as rising rental income
compensates for asset sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
