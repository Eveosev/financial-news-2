Spanish and Italian government bonds
opened little changed while German bunds fell, narrowing the
difference in yield, or spread, between the securities for the
first time in four days.  Spanish 10-year debt yielded 5.6 percent as of 7:37 a.m. in
 London , reducing the additional yield investors demand to hold
the securities instead of the benchmark German bonds by three
basis points to 265 basis points.  The Italian-German yield spread also narrowed three basis
points, to 216 basis points.  Irish 10-year bonds declined, sending the yield up eight
basis points to 12.52 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
