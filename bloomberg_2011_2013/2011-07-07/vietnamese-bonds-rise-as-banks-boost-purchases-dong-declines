Vietnam ’s five-year bonds gained on
speculation banks are buying debt after the government
restricted lending. The dong dropped.  Commercial banks must limit lending to “non-production
businesses” such as those investing in the stock and property
markets to 22 percent of loans by June 30 and to 16 percent by
the end of the year, the  State Bank  of Vietnam said in March.
There was no cap earlier. Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in
February that he aims to curb credit growth to less than 20
percent this year from an earlier target of 23 percent.  “Banks’ liquidity has become more comfortable while they
are not allowed to lend too much, leaving them free cash for
bond investments,” said Ho Chi Minh City-based Nguyen Duy Phong,
an analyst at ACB Securities Inc.  The yield on the notes fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 12.44 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong fell 0.1 percent to 20,598 per dollar as of 4:03
p.m. in Hanoi, from 20,585 yesterday, according to prices from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,613 today,
unchanged from yesterday, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the official
rate.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
