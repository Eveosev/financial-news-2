The  United Nations Mission in Sudan 
will start winding down on July 10, a day after the south is
declared independent, even as clashes force thousands of
civilians to flee in Southern Kordofan state, the head of UN
peacekeeping said.  “UNMIS will have no mandate in Southern Kordofan, at a
time when there is a very dire humanitarian situation and still
fighting is going on,” Alain LeRoy told reporters today in
Khartoum,  Sudan ’s capital.  Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Karti informed UN Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon that the UN’s 10,000-member peacekeeping
mission will end when the south becomes independent on July 9,
state-run SUNA reported May 28. Ban has proposed having a 7,000-
member peacekeeping force in Southern Sudan after independence.  Clashes between Sudanese government forces and troops loyal
to Southern Sudan’s army in Southern Kordofan have forced more
than 73,000 people to flee their homes since June 5, according
to the UN. The fighting there and in the disputed border region
of Abyei raised concern about the possible resumption of a two-
decade civil war that ended in 2005.  The UN, which currently has about 5,868 peacekeepers in
 Southern Sudan , will start operating a new mission in the south
the same day the mission in the north comes to an end, LeRoy
said. The UN Security Council in  New York  will discuss the
mandate of the south’s mission tomorrow, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
