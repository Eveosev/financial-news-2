Ukraine began mining uranium-ore at
the Novokonstantinovskoe deposit in the central Kryvyi Rih
region as part of a plan to become self-sufficient from 2020.  “We face the task of providing nuclear  power plants  with
locally produced nuclear fuel,” Mykyta Konstantinov, head of
the Energy and Coal Ministry’s nuclear policy and investments
department, said in an e-mailed statement today.  About 75,000 metric tons of uranium ore will be mined this
year and as much as 100 tons of uranium extracted, compared with
the 850 tons needed by Ukrainian power plants, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
