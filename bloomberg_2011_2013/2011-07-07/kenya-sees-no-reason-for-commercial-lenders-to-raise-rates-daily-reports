Kenya ’s central bank sees no reason
for commercial lenders to raise their interest rates and will
deal with higher loan costs at its next Monetary Policy
Committee meeting, Business Daily reported.  “I cannot reveal measures now because the commercial banks
would work to defeat the process,” the Nairobi-based newspaper
quoted Central Bank of Kenya Governor Njuguna Ndung’u as saying
yesterday.  At least six Kenyan banks have raised their base lending
rates by more than 1.5 percentage points in the past two weeks
to cushion their interest income amid demands for higher rates
by depositors, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
