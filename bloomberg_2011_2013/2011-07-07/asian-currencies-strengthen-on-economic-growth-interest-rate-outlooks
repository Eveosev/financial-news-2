Asian currencies gained, led by the
 Thai baht , on speculation the world’s fastest economic growth
and rising interest rates will attract more funds to the region.  Malaysia’s central bank will boost borrowing costs today
and the Bank of Thailand will do so next week, according to
separate Bloomberg surveys after China raised its benchmark
yesterday. A government report today showed Taiwan export growth
accelerated in June and the trade surplus widened.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s 10 most-active currencies excluding the yen, rose 0.1
percent to 119.01 as of 4:30 p.m. in  Hong Kong , approaching a
14-year high reached in May. The baht strengthened 0.5 percent
to 30.35 per dollar and  Singapore ’s currency gained 0.3 percent
to S$1.2263, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  India ’s
rupee added 0.2 percent to 44.4175 and  Indonesia ’s rupiah
advanced 0.1 percent to 8,543.  “ Asia  will probably see more fund inflows based on the
region’s strong economic performance,” said Shigehisa Shiroki,
chief trader on the Asian and emerging-markets team at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo . “Rate hikes are also positive for
the regional currencies.”  Developing economies in Asia will expand 8.4 percent in
2011, outpacing growth of 2.5 percent in the U.S. and 2 percent
in the euro region, according to International Monetary Fund
estimates released last month. Benchmark interest rates of 7.5
percent in India and 6.75 percent in Indonesia compare with a
maximum 0.25 percent in the U.S. and  Japan .  Global funds bought $1.2 billion more South Korean and Thai
stocks than they sold this week through yesterday, exchange data
show.  Yingluck Boosts Baht  China  raised its one-year deposit and lending rates by 25
basis points each to 3.5 percent and 6.56 percent, respectively.
Malaysia’s central bank will raise its policy rate today by a
quarter of a percentage point to 3.25 percent, according to 10
of 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Five forecast no change.
The Bank of Thailand will lift its rate by the same margin to
3.25 percent when policy makers meet on July 13, according to
all 10 economists in a separate survey.  The baht advanced to a one-month high after incoming Prime
Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said her government intended to let
the currency strengthen. Yingluck, head of the Pheu Thai party,
said  Thailand  will allow the baht to appreciate against the
dollar to help curb imported inflation, the Wall Street Journal
reported today.  “The markets may choose to interpret that as an official
viewpoint that currency appreciation would serve to cap
imported-price inflation,” said Emmanuel Ng, a currency
strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore. “The
market is well aware the Bank of Thailand has been one of the
more hawkish central banks in terms of rhetoric.”  Export Growth  A government report showed Taiwan’s exports rose 10.8
percent in June, compared with a 9.5 percent gain the previous
month, though they fell short of the 20 percent increase
forecast in a Bloomberg survey. The  trade surplus  widened to
$1.38 billion from $1.22 billion.  The rupiah advanced as global funds boosted holdings of the
nation’s assets. Offshore investors bought $59 million more
Indonesian shares than they sold in the first three days of the
week, according to exchange data, after Bank Indonesia Deputy
Governor Hartadi Sarwono said July 4 the economy will expand 6.6
percent this year, compared with 6.1 percent in 2010.  Overseas holdings of the country’s government bonds rose
4.3 percent last month to 234.99 trillion rupiah ($27.5 billion),
debt management office data show, as consumer prices eased for a
fifth month in June.  “The economy is doing well and Bank Indonesia is also
allowing the rupiah to appreciate to dampen some of the
inflationary pressure,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-
exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore.  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso rose 0.1 percent to 42.880
per dollar and  Malaysia ’s ringgit added 0.1 percent to 3.0100.
China’s yuan was little changed at 6.4658, while  South Korea ’s
won slipped 0.1 percent to 1,064.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
