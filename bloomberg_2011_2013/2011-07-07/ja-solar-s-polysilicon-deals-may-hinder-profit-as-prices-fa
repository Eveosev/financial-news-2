JA Solar Holdings Co., the world’s
biggest producer of photovoltaic panels by capacity, said it may
be unable to benefit from a decline in raw-material costs
because it’s locked into contracts with polysilicon providers.  “We may be placed at a competitive disadvantage versus our
competitors,” the Shanghai-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. “Our business and results of operations may
be materially and adversely affected.”  The spot price of solar-grade polysilicon plunged 28
percent in June after manufacturers ramped up capacity following
a boom in demand for solar panels, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance. GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd,  China ’s biggest
polysilicon maker, said in March it will more than double
capacity to 46,000 tons this year.  JA Solar said it’s “possible” that polysilicon prices
will fall further and it may not be able to negotiate price
reductions with suppliers. Polysilicon is the raw material for
solar cells.  JA Solar “is going to have a major revenue and
profitability problem,” said Gordon Johnson, a solar analyst at
Axiom Capital Management Inc. in  New York , who estimates the
company is paying $60 to $70 a kilogram for polysilicon compared
with a June spot price of $53.90.  The shares fell as much as 6.7 percent in New York and
traded down at 6.1 percent at $4.91 at 11:31 a.m. in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. The stock has lost 29 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
