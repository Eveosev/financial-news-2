The forint appreciated to the
strongest level in more than a year against the euro and
Hungarian shares extended gains after U.S. reports showed the
world’s largest economy added more jobs than expected in June.  The forint advanced as much as 1 percent to 261.96 per
euro, the highest since April 2010, and traded 0.8 percent up at
262.3 by 4:17 p.m. in Budapest. The BUX gauge of companies
jumped 1.4 percent, the most in more than a month, to 22,423.78,
rebounding from the lowest since March 15.  Stocks, U.S. index futures and commodities rose after ADP
Employer Services said U.S. companies added 157,000 workers to
their payrolls, bolstering confidence in the global economic
recovery.  Hungary  today sold 7.5 billion forint ($41 million) of
floating-rate bonds maturing in 2015, more than the 5 billion-
forint target, and 50 billion forint of 12-month Treasury bills.  Mol Nyrt., the biggest oil refiner in Hungary with a 29
percent weighting in the BUX index, jumped as much as 4.9
percent, the most in seven months, and traded up 4.8 percent to
20,860 forint. It rebounded from its lowest level since
December, reached yesterday, as crude oil surged to a three-week
high.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the former phone monopoly controlled
by Deutsche Telekom AG, advanced 0.9 percent to 576 forint after
losing 2.1 percent yesterday. OTP Bank Nyrt., the country’s
