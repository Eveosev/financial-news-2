EFG-Hermes Holding SAE,  Egypt ’s
biggest publicly traded investment bank, rose the most in more
than three weeks after receiving regulatory approval to offer
free stock to shareholders.  Shares of the Cairo-based company climbed 2.6 percent, the
most since June 14, to 20.93 Egyptian pounds at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Cairo. That gave the company a market value of 8
billion pounds ($1.3 billion). The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  rose
0.8 percent.  The  Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority  approved the
bank’s plan to distribute one bonus share for every four held,
EFG-Hermes said yesterday. Net income in the first quarter
dropped 93 percent to 36 million pounds from a year earlier
because of regional political unrest and a one-time gain in the
previous year, the company said in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
