A debate over the nationalization of
South African banks and mines may stall economic growth,
slashing jobs and compounding poverty, said Sim Tshabalala,
chief executive of Standard Bank Group Ltd.’s local unit.  “The campaign to nationalize the banks is billed to cause
a great deal of unnecessary damage to  South Africa ’s growth and
job-creation prospects,” Tshabalala wrote in Johannesburg’s
Business Day newspaper today. “If the nationalization debate
grinds on for many more months, there will be fewer new
businesses, fewer new jobs, more poverty and less development
for decades to come.”  The ruling  African National Congress  agreed in September to
study nationalization, responding to a call by Julius Malema,
leader of the party’s youth arm.  Under Malema, the Youth League has demanded the state take
over mines, banks and land to combat youth unemployment, poverty
and inequality in Africa’s biggest economy. The country has a 25
percent unemployment rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
