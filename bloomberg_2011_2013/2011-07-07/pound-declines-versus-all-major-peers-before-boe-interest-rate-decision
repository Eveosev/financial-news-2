U.K. government bonds fell, pushing
up 10-year yields by the most in a week, as gains in stocks and
a report showing the  U.S. economy  added more workers than
forecast reduced demand for the safest assets.  Gilts also dropped alongside German bonds after the
 European Central Bank  waived its collateral rules for Portuguese
government debt in financing operations after the Iberian
nation’s credit rating was downgraded to junk this week. The
pound slid against the dollar as the Bank of England left its
benchmark interest rate at a record low and maintained its bond-
purchase program to help support the U.K. recovery.  “The job data out of the U.S. is stronger than expected
and that pushed bond-yields higher,” said  Sam Hill , a gilt
strategist at  RBC Capital Markets . “The Bank of England kept
rates unchanged today, but we think the outlook for the economy
might improve in the second half and we expect interest rates to
rise in November. If that scenario unfolds, we would look for
gilt yields to go higher.”  Ten-year gilt yields rose as much as 6.8 basis points,
matching the steepest climb since June 29, before settling five
basis points higher at 3.30 percent as of 4:48 p.m. in  London .
The 3.75 percent security due September 2020 fell 0.420, or 4.20
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,597) face amount, to 103.545. The
yield on two-year notes added two basis points to 0.81 percent.  The pound was 0.3 percent weaker at $1.5963 and was 0.2
percent stronger at 129.751 yen. Sterling depreciated 0.5
percent to 89.88 pence per euro. Stocks rose, with the  FTSE 100
Index (UKX)  of shares gaining 0.9 percent.  U.S. Jobs  U.S. companies added 157,000 workers to their payrolls in
June, according to figures from ADP Employer Services,
bolstering confidence in tomorrow’s Labor Department jobs
report. The ECB raised interest rates 25 basis points to 1.5
percent today, the second increase this year.  The implied yield on short-sterling futures expiring in
March 2012 rose two basis points to 1.03 percent. The implied
yield has fallen from a high of 2.08 percent in February as
investors bet interest rates will stay low for longer. Short-
sterling futures are used by analysts to gauge the future
trajectory of borrowing costs between banks.  Investors have increased bets that the  Bank of England 
won’t raise borrowing costs until after next May, data from
Tullett Prebon Plc on forward contracts for the sterling
overnight interbank average, or Sonia, show. As recently as
February, the data indicated traders were betting on a rate
increase in May of this year.  U.K. government bonds have returned 2.6 percent this year
compared with 0.6 percent for German debt and 2.7 percent for
U.S. Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
