The following is the text of
the new house price index report for May released by
 Statistics Canada .  The New Housing Price Index (NHPI) rose 0.4% in May
following a 0.3% advance in April.  Toronto and Oshawa as well as Montreal were the top
contributors to the NHPI increase in May.  Between April and May, prices increased the most in
Regina (+1.7%) followed by Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo
(+1.0%) as well as Toronto and Oshawa (+0.9%).  In Regina, the rise in prices was mostly a result of
increased material, labour, and land development costs.
According to builders in Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo and
in Toronto and Oshawa, the price increases were mainly a
result of competitive market conditions.  In May, prices remained unchanged in 7 of the 21
metropolitan regions surveyed.  The most significant monthly price decline was recorded
in Ottawa-Gatineau (-0.7%), as some builders offered
promotional pricing or free upgrade packages to generate
sales.  Year over year, the NHPI was up 1.9% in May following
an identical increase in April. The main contributors to
the advance in May were the metropolitan regions of
Toronto and Oshawa as well as  Montreal .  The largest year-over-year price increase was in St.
John's (+4.7%) followed by Toronto and Oshawa (+4.3%).  Compared with May 2010, contractors' selling prices
were also higher in Winnipeg (+4.1%), Kitchener-Cambridge-
Waterloo (+3.8%), Montreal (+3.6%) and Regina (+3.4%).  Among the 21 metropolitan regions surveyed, 6 posted 12-
month price declines in May, led by Windsor (-4.4%) and
Victoria (-1.7%).  Note: The New Housing Price Index measures changes over
time in the selling prices of new residential houses
agreed upon between the contractor and the buyer at the
time of the signing of the contract. It is designed to
measure the changes in the selling prices of new houses
where detailed specifications pertaining to each house
remain the same between two consecutive periods. The
prices collected from builders and included in the index
are market selling prices less value added taxes, such as
the Federal Goods and Services Tax or the Harmonized Sales
Tax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
