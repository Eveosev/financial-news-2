Canadian stocks fell, trimming a
weekly gain, as oil and base-metals prices slipped after the
U.S. reported an increase in its  unemployment rate .  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, dropped 1.6 percent after the U.S. Labor Department
said non-farm employment increased last month by the least since
September.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ) , Canada’s second-
biggest energy company by market value, declined 3.1 percent as
crude oil lost the most in two weeks. Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., the world’s largest fertilizer producer by
market value, rose 2.6 percent as corn and wheat gained.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 34.3
points, or 0.3 percent, to 13,371.70, reducing its weekly
advance to 0.5 percent.  The jobs data “put a real damper on the market,” said
 David Cockfield , senior vice president and managing director at
Northland Wealth Management in Toronto, which oversees C$200
million ($208 million). “People were expecting better. There
were various excuses for previous bad numbers --  Japan , bad
weather -- and those excuses are starting to run off.”  The S&P/TSX rose seven of the previous eight days as
European leaders took action to prevent a Greek default and a
gauge of U.S. manufacturing surpassed economists’ forecasts. The
index slumped 5 percent from the end of March as U.S.
unemployment increased in April and May. Seventy-five percent of
Canadian exports went to the U.S. last year, according to
Statistics  Canada .  Unemployment Climbs  U.S. payrolls rose by 18,000 in June, less than all 85
economist estimates in a Bloomberg survey. The unemployment rate
climbed to 9.2 percent, the highest since December, from 9.1
percent.  Unemployment in Canada was unchanged at 7.4 percent, the
lowest since January 2009.  Crude oil futures retreated 2.5 percent after the release
of the U.S. jobs report. Canadian Oil Stands Ltd., the largest
owner of the Syncrude project, decreased 1 percent to C$28.01.
Bonavista Energy Corp., a western Canadian energy producer, fell
3.2 percent to C$28.15.  Canadian Natural slumped 3.1 percent to C$40.36 after
Thomas R. Driscoll, an analyst at Barclays Plc, cut his rating
on the shares to “equal weight” from “overweight.” About 70
percent of the company’s capital spending “may be devoted to
assets with unexciting rates of return,” Driscoll said in a
note to clients.  All major base metals traded on the London Metal Exchange
dropped, with copper declining from a 10-week high. Teck lost
1.6 percent to C$50.15.  First Quantum Minerals Ltd. (FM) , Canada’s
second-largest publicly traded copper producer, decreased 2.2
percent to C$136.20.  Hot Weather  Corn rose 3.5 percent, extending the first weekly gain
since May, as forecasts for hot, dry weather in the U.S. Midwest
led to concern crops may suffer. Wheat advanced 2.6 percent.  Potash Corp. increased 2.6 percent to C$56.89.  Agrium Inc. (AGU) ,
Canada’s second-largest fertilizer producer, climbed 1.5 percent
to C$86.30.  Viterra Inc. (VT) , Canada’s biggest grain handler, rose
1.9 percent to C$10.92.  European Goldfields Ltd. (EGU) , which is developing mines in
 Europe , surged 11 percent to C$13.65 after receiving
environmental approval for its projects in  Greece . Shares of the
Whitehorse, Yukon-based company soared 35 percent this week, the
most since 2003.  Directory publisher  Yellow Media Inc. (YLO)  tumbled 11 percent to
C$2.40 after Scott Cuthbertson, an analyst at Toronto-Dominion
Bank, cut his rating on the shares to “reduce” from “hold.”  In a note to clients, Cuthbertson cited “accelerating
deterioration in the fundamentals of the core business” and
“mounting concerns about the balance sheet and continuation of
the dividend.”  Yellow Media shares have plunged 61 percent this year,
stretching its dividend yield to 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
