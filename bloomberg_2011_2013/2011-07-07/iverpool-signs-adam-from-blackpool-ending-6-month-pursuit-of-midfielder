Liverpool completed the signing of
 Charlie Adam  from Blackpool, ending the 18-time English soccer
champion’s six-month pursuit of the Scotland midfielder.  Adam, 25, signed a contract yesterday after successfully
completing a medical, Liverpool said on its website without
disclosing the length of the agreement or the transfer fee.  He’s Liverpool’s second offseason acquisition after  Jordan
Henderson , a fellow midfielder, as manager  Kenny Dalglish  tries
to bolster a squad that finished sixth in the Premier League
last season.  “It’s been a long chase since the end of January but we’ve
always kept our interest because we knew he was a quality
player,” Liverpool’s Director of Football Damien Comolli told
his team’s website. “For Kenny, he was a priority and we’ve
done everything we could to get him.”  Adam was shortlisted for the Professional Footballers’
Association Player of the Year award last season after scoring
12 goals in 35 Premier League games.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
