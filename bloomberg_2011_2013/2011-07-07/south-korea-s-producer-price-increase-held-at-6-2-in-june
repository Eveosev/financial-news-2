South Korea ’s producer-price growth
stayed at the lowest level this year last month, underpinning
the case for the nation’s central bank to keep borrowing costs
on hold next week.  Prices increased 6.2 percent in June from a year earlier,
unchanged from May’s pace, after peaking at a 28-month high of
7.3 percent in March, the  Bank of Korea  said in a statement in
Seoul today. They fell 0.3 percent from May.  Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent last month from a year ago,
breaching the central bank’s 4 percent target ceiling for a
sixth straight month. The central bank will probably hold its
benchmark seven-day repurchase rate at 3.25 percent next week
after three advances so far this year, according to four of five
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
