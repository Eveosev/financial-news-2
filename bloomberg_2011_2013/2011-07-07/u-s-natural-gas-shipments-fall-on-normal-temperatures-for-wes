Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. electricity generators fell on forecasts for normal
temperatures in the West that would reduce demand for the fuel
to power air-conditioners.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to  power plants  in the
U.S. and Canada shows shipments dropped 6.7 percent to 20.6
million dekatherms (20 billion cubic feet), according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Shipments to power generators in
California dropped 7.8 percent.  Much of the West will have normal temperatures until July
11, MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said in a
note to clients. Below-normal temperatures are forecast for the
West Coast from July 12 to July 16.  Cooling demand in  San Francisco  and Seattle will be non-
existent until at least July 14, said Weather Derivatives, based
in Belton, Missouri. Power plants use 30 percent of U.S. gas
supplies, according to the Energy Department.  The high in Denver today may reach 87 degrees Fahrenheit
(31 Celsius), which is normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. of
 State College , Pennsylvania.  Scheduled gas shipments for U.S. residences fell 17.5
percent to 22.2 million dekatherms after a 1.4 percent drop
yesterday.  Wholesale gas at the SoCal Border hub, where gas is
delivered to California, dropped 8.49 cents, or 1.9 percent, to
$4.4013 per million British thermal units as of 1:45 p.m. New
York time on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
fell 9.5 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $4.2486 per million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
