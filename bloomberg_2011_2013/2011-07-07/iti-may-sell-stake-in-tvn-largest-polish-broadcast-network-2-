TVN SA (TVN) , Poland’s largest TV network,
said majority owner ITI Holdings SA may sell its entire stake in
the company.  ITI, advised by JPMorgan and Nomura, hasn’t made any
decisions on a “potential sale” of its 56 percent stake, the
media company whose assets include cinema chain Multikino and
Internet portal Onet.pl, said in an e-mailed statement after TVN
made its announcement in a regulatory filing.  TVN shares jumped 5.1 percent to 16.2 zloty in Warsaw
trading, valuing the company at 5.57 billion zloty ($2 billion).  ITI asked four investors including Fox Entertainment Group
Inc.,  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  and Bertelsmann AG for initial
expressions of interest in its assets,  Puls Biznesu  reported
today, citing people it didn’t name.  Bertelsmann’s RTL Group is “generally prepared” to
consider acquisitions, “especially” in growth markets such as
eastern and central Europe, said Oliver Fahlbusch, a spokesman
for the unit, declining to comment on ITI.  Keith Cocozza , a spokesman for Time Warner, and Alice Macandrew, a spokeswoman for  News Corp. (NWSA) , parent of Fox
Entertainment, didn’t comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
