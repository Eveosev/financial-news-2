The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index
advanced to a more than five-week high, gaining 165.36, or 0.5
percent, to 32,296.07 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of the benchmark  stock index , climbed
to the highest price since May 31, adding 4.01 rand, or 1.2
percent, to 340 rand. Copper for three month delivery rallied to
an almost three-month high, rising as much as 2.3 percent to
$9,741.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange after the
ADP Employer Services jobs report for June showed American
companies added more workers than forecast last month.  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  , the world’s biggest mining
company, snapped two days of declines, advancing 4.25 rand, or
1.6 percent, to 269.99 rand.  Bidvest Group Ltd. (BVT)  , a diversified management
company, rose to its highest since at least August 1990,
according to Bloomberg data, advancing 50 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to 162.50 rand. The group’s offer to buy  Mercantile Bank
Holdings Ltd. (MTL)  was rejected by Caixa Geral de Depositos SA’s
board, the Portuguese bank said in an e-mailed statement.  Mercantile Bank Holdings Ltd. (MTL SJ), fell to the lowest
in more than a week, dropping 4 cents, or 13 percent, to 27
cents.  Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  , the biggest seller of coal
to South African power utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., gained
for a third day, adding 3.07 rand, or 1.7 percent, to 184.75
rand. Shipments from Richards Bay Coal Terminal, on  South
Africa ’s east coast, rose 19 percent in June from a year
earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data
published on the terminal’s website today.  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  , the iron ore-producing unit
of Anglo American, closed at its highest since its shares
started trading in November 2006, rising 11 rand, or 2.3
percent, to 500 rand. The group said profit for the six months
to June 30 would be as much as 42 percent higher than the
previous year due to higher export iron-ore prices.  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  , South Africa’s fourth-largest
commercial bank, gained 1 rand, or 0.7 percent, to 147.50 rand.
Profit excluding one-time items probably rose at least 20
percent compared with a year earlier, the bank said in a trading
statement.  Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM)  , the operator of the world’s
deepest platinum mine, closed at its lowest since August 2010,
losing 52 cents, or 1.3 percent, to 40.47 rand. The miner said
it is not clear when underground operations at its Zondereinde
operations in South Africa will resume following the death of a
mineworker. It said the production disruption “has not been
material.”  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest maker of vehicle
fuel from coal, advanced to the highest in more than a month,
gaining 6.62 rand, or 1.8 percent, to 365.60 rand. Oil rose as
much as 2.9 percent to $99.42 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
