U.K. stocks rallied, sending the
benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  to its highest level in two months,
after a report said that U.S. companies added more than twice as
many jobs last month as economists had expected.  Man Group Plc (EMG)  surged 3.6 percent, after saying that
investors added $3.7 billion in net funds to the company’s hedge
funds in the three months through June. Rio Tinto Group,
 Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  all rose more than 2
percent.  Hammerson Plc (HMSO)  slumped 4.8 percent as a unit of  Ontario
Teachers’ Pension Plan  sold its entire 12 percent stake in the
company.  The FTSE 100 rose 0.9 percent to 6,054.55 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in London. The gauge yesterday ended an eight-day rally,
its longest winning streak since July 2009, as Moody’s Investors
Service downgraded Portugal’s credit rating to junk. The FTSE
All-Share Index advanced 0.8 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index increased 0.3 percent.  “If the U.S. continues to create jobs at the rate it was
earlier in the year then I would regard that as positive news,”
said  David Miller , partner at Cheviot Asset Management Ltd. in
 London . The health of U.S. consumers and businesses “is highly
influential and important for all major economies.”  U.K. stocks extended their gains after a report from ADP
Employer Services said that U.S. companies added 157,000 jobs in
June, more than double the 70,000 average estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  The data comes a day before the U.S. Labor Department’s
monthly payrolls and unemployment releases.  Stocks rallied further after European Central Bank
President Jean-Claude Trichet said that policy makers have
waived the minimum collateral rules for Portuguese government
debt in refinancing operations.  ECB Interest Rate  The euro area’s central bank also increased its benchmark
interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent. The  Bank of
England  held its key rate at a record low of 0.5 percent.  In the U.K., a measure of the country’s manufacturing
output increased 1.8 percent in May. That beat the average
economist estimate in a Bloomberg News survey for an increase of
1 percent.  Man Group rallied 3.6 percent to 255.7 pence as the world’s
biggest hedge fund manager said assets under management rose 2.8
percent in the three months through June. Man’s assets in its
fiscal first quarter increased to $71 billion from $69.1 billion
at the end of March, the London-based company said.  Mining stocks were among the best performing industries in
the benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index, rallying 1.8 percent.
Copper prices hit an 11-week high in London today.  Kazakhmys advanced 3.1 percent to 1,405 pence, while  Rio
Tinto , the world’s second-biggest miner, gained 2.3 percent to
4,595 pence and Anglo American increased 2.1 percent to 3,181
pence.  Hammerson Shares Slump  Hammerson sank 4.8 percent to 463.7 pence as its biggest
shareholder sold its holding in the U.K.’s third-largest real-
estate investment trust.  Cadillac Fairview, a unit of Ontario Teachers’ Pension
Plan, sold its 85.6 million shares in Hammerson at 463 pence
apiece, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a statement today.  Shares in GKN Plc rose to a 3 1/2 year high, soaring 3.2
percent to 245 pence amid speculation Credit Suisse Group AG and
JPMorgan Chase & Co. included the company on lists of possible
takeover targets.  BSkyB Slides  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  fell 1.8 percent to 812
pence as investors speculated that a probe into phone hacking at
the News of the World tabloid may delay government approval for
parent company  News Corp .’s takeover of the U.K.’s largest
listed broadcaster. Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp. bid 700 pence a
share for the 61 percent of BSkyB it doesn’t own. After the
close, News Corp. announced it will close the newspaper.  Premier Farnell Plc (PFL) , the electronics distributor, tumbled
20 percent to 195 pence, for the largest decline on the  FTSE 250
Index. (MCX)  Premier Farnell posted year-on-year sales growth for May
and June of 1.4 percent, less than the 6 to 8 percent pace that
the company had predicted.  “This performance reflects a marked moderation of growth
rates in all global markets during June,” Premier Farnell said
in a statement.  Capital Shopping Centres Group Plc (CSCG)  slipped 3 percent to
385.6 pence, its third day of declines, after Credit Suisse
downgraded the shares to “underperform” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
