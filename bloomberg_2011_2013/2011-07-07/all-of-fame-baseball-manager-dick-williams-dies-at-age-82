Dick Williams, the Hall of Fame
manager who led the  Oakland Athletics  to two World Series titles,
died today at age 82.  Williams, who also managed the  Boston Red Sox  and San Diego
Padres to pennants, suffered an aortic aneurysm and died at a
hospital near his home in Henderson, Nevada, the Baseball Hall
of Fame said in an e-mailed statement.  “We are extremely saddened by the sudden loss of Dick,”
Jane Forbes Clark, the chairman of the National Baseball Hall of
Fame and Museum said in the statement. “He was an intense
leader on the field and a gracious member of the Hall of Fame
family.”  Williams, who was elected to the  National Baseball Hall of
Fame  by the veterans’ committee in 2008, was a Major League
Baseball manager for 21 years. He won the  World Series  with the
Athletics in 1972 and 1973, an American League pennant with the
Red Sox in 1967 and the National League title with the Padres in
1984.  Other managerial stops for Williams, who had a 1,571-1,451

Expos and Seattle Mariners.  Williams also played 13 major league seasons as an
outfielder, third baseman and first baseman, retiring with
a .260 batting average, 70 home runs and 331 runs batted in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
