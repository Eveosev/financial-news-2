The euro fell against the dollar,
extending declines, after European Central Bank President Jean-
Claude Trichet said policy makers will monitor all developments
“very closely.”  The euro weakened 0.6 percent to $1.4240 as of 1:41 p.m. in
 London , and depreciated 0.4 percent against the pound to 89.08
pence.  Trichet said recent data signaled some deceleration in 
economic growth.   To contact the reporter on this story:
