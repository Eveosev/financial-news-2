BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, said it halted its port and rail
operations at  Port Hedland  in Western  Australia  following an
incident at the site that led to a fatality this morning.  “At this stage we are unable to provide any further detail
about the incident, but will do so as soon as possible during
the day,” BHP said in an e-mailed  statement . The onsite
emergency team has been activated and the police are attending
the scene, according to the statement.  Port Hedland houses BHP’s port and rail facilities for its
iron ore operations in Pilbara, in Western Australia, according
to the company’s  website . Almost all of BHP’s iron ore, the
company’s biggest revenue earner, is mined in the state, while a
smaller quantity is produced through a joint venture in  Brazil 
with Vale SA, the world’s largest producer.  Any impact on iron ore production will be reflected in
BHP’s next quarterly output report, Fiona Martin, a Melbourne-
based spokeswoman for the company, said by telephone, declining
to elaborate further.  Shares of BHP fell 0.6 percent to A$44.17 as of 11:05 a.m.
in Sydney trading, while the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index
declined 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
