European nations should pool funding
of antibiotics research, so pharmaceutical companies that
register new drugs of this type are rewarded quickly, according
to a study financed by  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  and produced by the
Office of Health Economics, a policy review group, the Financial
Times reported.  Payment on registration would be a departure from the
present system of national medicine pricing and might result in
more innovation, the newspaper said.  Antibiotics shouldn’t be dealt with like conventional
medicines, which are granted a monopoly and marketed heavily to
maximize sales, because this encourages excessive use,
stimulating resistance among patients and shortening the drugs’
useful lives, according to the study, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
