A Turkish court arrested 15 people,
including an executive of soccer league champion Fenerbahce SK
and a former national team player, as part of an investigation
into alleged match fixing, state news agency Anatolia reported.  The Istanbul court jailed the 15 pending trial and also
issued a warrant for Fenerbahce head Aziz Yildirim, who is being
treated in hospital, the agency reported. Yildirim Demiroren,
chairman of Istanbul club Besiktas JK, is expected to testify to
the inquiry today, Anatolia said.  Among the jailed were Fenerbahce Vice Chairman Sekip
Mosturoglu, and Umit Karan, a former national striker who played
last season for Eskisehirspor.  Police said yesterday they have evidence of illegal
attempts to influence the outcome of 19 matches in the countryâ€™s
top two leagues. Fenerbahce won the championship and could be
stripped of the title.  To contact the reporter on this story:
