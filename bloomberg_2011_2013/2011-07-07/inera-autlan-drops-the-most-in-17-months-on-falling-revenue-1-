Cia. Minera Autlan SAB,  North
America ’s largest manganese producer, fell the most in more than
17 months in Mexico City after saying first-half sales and
profit fell.  The San Pedro Garza Garcia-based miner dropped 4.3 percent,
the most since Jan. 21, 2010, to 24.81 pesos at 5:16 p.m. New
York time.  “The company is being punished by some investors because
it seems it has little room to grow,” Marco Reyes, an analyst
at Interacciones Casa de Bolsa in Mexico City, said today in a
telephone interview. Reyes said Autlan is already operating at
close to capacity.  Autlan’s sales dropped about 14 percent in the first half
of this year and Ebitda, a measure of earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, declined about 40 percent,
the company said yesterday in a preliminary earnings statement
to the Mexican stock exchange.  The Mexican producer of manganese, a mineral used to
produce steel, only provided a percentage change estimate for
revenue and Ebitda.  To contact the reporter on this story:
