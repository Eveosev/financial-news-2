Lower agriculture prices will bolster
demand, tightening global  food supply , Morgan Stanley said in a
report e-mailed today.  A decline in corn futures has improved ethanol and
livestock margins, reducing the incentive to ration demand for
the grain, it said. China may buy more corn to rebuild
stockpiles as production trails demand by 10 million tons, the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
