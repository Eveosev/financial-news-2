Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures rose after a report showed American
companies added more workers than forecast in June and after
U.S. crude supplies fell.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.9 percent as of 3 p.m. in  New
York , down from 29.7 percent yesterday.  Crude for August delivery gained $2.02, or 2.1 percent, to
$98.67 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since June 14. Prices have climbed 33 percent in the
past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
August $100 calls, with 2,534 lots changing hands. They gained
37 cents to 93 cents a barrel. August $102 calls, the next-most
active option, rose 16 cents to 41 cents a barrel with 1,458
lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  September $78 puts were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 6,007 lots changing hands. They edged up 4 cents
to 23 cents a barrel. The next-most active options, August $95
puts, rose 7 cents to $1.15 a barrel on volume of 5,274 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $120 calls with
43,154 contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 40,107 and
December $80 puts with 38,503.  To contact the reporter on this story:
