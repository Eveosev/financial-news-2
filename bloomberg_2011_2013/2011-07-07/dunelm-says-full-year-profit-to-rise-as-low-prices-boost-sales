Dunelm Group Plc (DNLM) , a U.K. operator of
budget home-furnishing stores, says it expects full-year profit
to match forecasts, helped by sales growth of 9.3 percent to  in
the 13 weeks through July 2.  The company said sales were 262.9 million pounds ($420
million) in the period, as like-for-like sales rose 1.9 percent;
same-store sales for the fiscal year ending July 2 fell 0.6
percent. Low store prices in the quarter attracted customers
even though taxes increased and commodity prices rose, the
Leicester, England-based company said in a statement on
Regulatory News Service.  Nick Bubb , a retail analyst at Arden Partners Plc, said the
rise in same-store sales showed Dunelm was increasing market
share in a tough environment.  Capital investment  approached 40 million pounds as Dunelm
refitted 24 of its stores, while it intends building 13
superstores, according to the statement.  “In what has been a particularly challenging year, we are
encouraged both by the trading performance and by the strategic
development of the business,” Chief Executive Officer Nick Wharton said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
