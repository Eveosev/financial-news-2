The  European Central Bank ’s expected
interest-rate increase today won’t affect economies in Europe’s
periphery “that much,” HSBC Holdings Plc Chief Economist
 Stephen King  said.  Those countries “are already paying a fortune to fund their
deficits so the answer is probably not that much” King told
Francine Lacqua on Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move” today
in London, when asked how much harm an interest increase could
do. “The key question really is, to what extent will the
increase in  interest rates  damage broader growth prospects
across the euro zone?”  The ECB announces its monetary-policy decision at 1:45 p.m.
in Frankfurt and Trichet, whose term ends on October 31, holds a
briefing 45 minutes later. All 55 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News forecast the central bank to raise its benchmark
rate by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent to contain price
pressures, even as  Greece  threatens to succumb to the region’s
first sovereign default.  In the last year, growth has not improved in certain
countries such as Greece, King said. “The question is, to what
extent is there room for countries like Greece, Ireland,
Portugal and Spain to actually see their economies recovering,”
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
