Visa Inc. (V) , the world’s largest
payment network, said a Federal Reserve cap on debit-card fees
may lead to slower growth in revenue and earnings in 2012
compared with the current year.  Revenue growth for the 2012 fiscal year will be in the
“high single-digit to low double-digits range,” the San
Francisco-based company said yesterday in a filing. That’s down
from a projection of 11 percent to 15 percent for the 2011
fiscal year.  “We expect that fiscal 2012 will bear the weight of the
regulations financially and in fiscal 2013 revenue growth will
regain momentum,” Visa Chief Executive Officer Joseph Saunders
said yesterday on a conference call. The 2012 forecasts are
“based on the changing business landscape including the
assumption that some portion of transactions may be routed
away” to competitors, he said.  Investors have been concerned the cap on debit-card
transaction fees, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, would crimp
Visa’s profits. The central bank last week capped debit-card
swipe fees, also called interchange, at 21 cents a transaction,
increasing the limit from an earlier proposal of 12 cents. The
system replaces a formula based on a percentage of the purchase
price that averaged 44 cents.  Visa and its rival  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  set interchange fees
that are paid by merchants and pass the money to card issuers
like  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  Shares of the
two card networks fell more than 10 percent on Dec. 16, when the
Fed’s cap was first proposed. Visa climbed 15 percent on June 29
when the Fed increased the cap.  Visa rose $1.81, or 2.1 percent, to $90.01 at 9:53 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares advanced
25 percent this year through yesterday.  An Improvement  “On balance, the rules are an improvement from the initial
draft proposed in December 2010,” Saunders said.  Diluted Class A common stock earnings-per-share growth in
the next fiscal year may be in the middle-to-high teens, less
than the 2011 per-share growth forecast of greater than 20
percent, the filing shows.  Visa projects client incentives, intended to generate
transaction volume on its network, will be at the high end of
the projected range of 16 percent to 16.5 percent of gross
revenue this year, Saunders said on the call.  The company also completed a $1 billion stock buyback
program, purchasing 13 million shares at an average price of
$77, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
