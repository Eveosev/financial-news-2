Kenya’s economy will expand 4.5
percent this year, less than previously forecast, Pinebridge
Investments East Africa Ltd. Senior Investment Manager Peter
Wachira said.  Growth will miss the former estimate of 5 percent as
inflation accelerates to 22.9 percent by year-end, Wachira told
reporters today in Nairobi, the capital.  “All the key drivers of inflation such as food, transport,
electricity and water and a sharp depreciation of the shilling
have aggravated the situation,” he said.  Inflation accelerated to 14.5 percent in June, the fastest
pace in more than two years, as dry weather in East Africa’s
biggest economy curbed agricultural and the shilling weakened to
a 17-year low on June 22. The government forecast on June 8 that
economic growth will slow to 5.3 percent this year from 5.6
percent in 2010 as the rising cost of imported fuel and food
limits consumer spending.  Gross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 0.5
percent in the first quarter from the previous three months,
when it grew 2.2 percent, the Nairobi-based  Kenya National
Bureau of Statistics  said in an e-mail on June 30.  The Kenya government has allowed the importation of corn
duty free to ease food shortage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
