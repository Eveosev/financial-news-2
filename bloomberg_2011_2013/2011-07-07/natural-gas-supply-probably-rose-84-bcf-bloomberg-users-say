The U.S. Energy Department’s natural-
gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington , will show that supplies rose 3.5 percent last week,
according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 84 billion cubic feet in the week ended July
1 to 2.516 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for August delivery gained 1.6 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $4.233 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 10:23 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
