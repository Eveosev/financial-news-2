Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. pilots
suspended plans to strike pending a vote on a new pay offer from
the carrier controlled by U.K. billionaire  Richard Branson , the
British AirLine Pilots Association said today.  Virgin Atlantic, the second-biggest long-haul carrier at
 London ’s Heathrow airport, revised its pay proposal after the
union rejected an earlier offer and voted June 21 to strike.
Details of the package will be revealed once they have been
communicated to members the union said in a statement.  “Pilots have never wished to inconvenience the travelling
public, especially those looking forward to summer holidays,”
Balpa General Secretary Jim McAuslan said. “We have therefore
lifted the threat of strike action.”  Virgin’s pilots, who haven’t had a salary increase since
2008, rejected the previous offer of 4 percent raise this year
and one of 3 percent next year and in 2013. The carrier, which
is closely held, froze pay to cut costs and ride out a slump in
demand for  air travel  in the wake of the global recession.  “We can confirm that negotiations are now concluded and
Balpa will present a pay offer to its members over the coming
weeks,” Virgin Atlantic said in an e-mailed statement. “The
threat of  strike action  has now been removed and our flying
schedule remains completely unaffected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
