Saudi Arabia ’s activities in the
crude market appear like rivalry and  Iran ’s oil officials need
to be wary,  Shargh  reported, citing Iran’s OPEC governor
Mohammad Ali Khatibi.  In the worst-case scenario Saudi Arabia would have an
additional output capacity of up to 2 million barrels and “can
harm the balance by producing this amount,” Khatibi told the
Tehran-based newspaper in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
