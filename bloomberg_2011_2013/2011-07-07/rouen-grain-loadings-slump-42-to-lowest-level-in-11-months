Grain loadings for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub,
slumped for a fourth week, sliding to the lowest level in at
least 11 months as wheat shipments to  Africa  declined.  Outbound shipments were 40,713 metric tons in the June 30
to July 6 period, the  Seine River port  said in an e-mailed
statement today, down from 69,850 tons a week earlier and the
smallest volume since at least the start of August 2010.  Algeria was the biggest export destination with 16,005 tons
of wheat, compared with 26,250 tons in the prior week and 46,650
tons two weeks ago.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s wheat exports in
2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay, which shipped
out 19 percent, according to data from national crops office
FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
