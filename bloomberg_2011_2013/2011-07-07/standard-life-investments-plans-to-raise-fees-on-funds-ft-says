Standard Life Investments has written
an e-mail to financial advisers informing them that fees on
seven retail funds and two institutional funds will rise in
November, the Financial Times reported, citing the e-mail.
Investors will be informed in writing next week, the FT said.  Financial advisers AWD Chase de Vere and Advisers
Bestinvest said they will review clients’ portfolios and
Philippa Gee, managing director of Philippa Gee  Wealth
Management , said the move is “wrong and badly timed,”
according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
