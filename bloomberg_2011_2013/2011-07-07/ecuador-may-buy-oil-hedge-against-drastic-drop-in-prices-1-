Ecuador , the smallest member of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, may buy oil
hedges to protect against sharp declines in the price of crude,
central bank President  Diego Borja  said today.  The government hasn’t decided when it might purchase the
oil hedges, Borja said in an interview on television channel
Ecuavisa, without providing more details. Ecuador’s President
 Rafael Correa  said July 2 a possible economic slowdown in  Europe 
and the U.S. could push crude prices lower in 2012, according to
a statement in the presidential gazette.  The price of Ecuador’s Oriente crude, which this year has
averaged almost $26 per barrel more than the $73.30 forecast in
the 2011 budget, fell 5.2 percent from the end of May to
yesterday, according to Bloomberg data. The government, which
receives about 24 percent of its revenue from oil, wants to
guarantee prices don’t drop too low to ensure enough funds to
continue financing budgeted public works projects, Borja said.  “It’s important to cover yourself when there are drastic
falls” in the price of oil, Borja said in the interview. “The
government is studying when it would be convenient to buy
them.”  Oriente crude rose $2.21, or 2.2 percent, today to $101.09
per barrel as of 9:34 a.m. New York time, its highest intraday
price since June 10, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
