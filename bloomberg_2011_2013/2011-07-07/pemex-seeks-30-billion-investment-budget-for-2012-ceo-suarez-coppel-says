Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest oil producer, is seeking to boost its capital
expenditures budget by 22 percent next year to increase output,
the company’s chief executive officer said.  The board of Pemex, as the  Mexico  City-based company is
known, approved “a little bit less than” 350 billion pesos
($30.3 billion) for next year’s investments, CEO  Juan Jose Suarez Coppel  said yesterday in an interview with Radio Formula.
Pemex’s investment plan requires approval by Mexico’s finance
ministry, Suarez Coppel said, according to a transcript of the
interview posted today on the company’s website.  As of May 31, state-owned Pemex had invested 69.6 billion
pesos, or 25 percent, of its 2011 budget, according to a monthly
company report. Last year’s Pemex budget proposal was cut to 286
billion pesos from 300 billion pesos by the  finance ministry 
before being sent to Congress for final approval.  After the ministry’s evaluation, the 2012 proposal will be
submitted to Congress in September and is scheduled to be voted
on by Nov. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
