Companies in the U.S. added twice as
many workers as forecast in June, signaling an improvement in
the labor market that may help bolster the economy in the second
half of the year.  The 157,000 increase followed a 36,000 gain the prior
month, according to data from ADP Employer Services. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for an advance of
70,000. Other reports today showed fewer Americans filed jobless
claims and  consumer confidence  eased from a 10-week high.  Stocks rose as the payroll additions, along with recent
signs of faster manufacturing, reinforced the  Federal Reserve ’s
view that the slowdown in the first half was temporary. While
hiring may be picking up, a sustained drop in the unemployment
rate from 9.1 percent may require bigger job gains.  “Reports of the death of the labor market were greatly
exaggerated,” said  Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in New York. “It looks like
things snapped back in June.” Still, “there’s going to be a
period of adjustment before U.S. companies feel secure about
their revenue stream and ramp up hiring in a big way.”  Payroll increases of around 200,000 a month are needed for
a sustained decline in the  unemployment rate , according to  Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond James & Associates Inc. in  St.
Petersburg ,  Florida .  Estimates Raised  In the wake of the ADP figures, economists at Deutsche Bank
Securities were among those raising payroll estimates for
tomorrow’s June employment report from the Labor Department.  The economy added 105,000 jobs last month, almost double
the 54,000 created a month earlier, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Private hiring climbed 125,000
last month, while the jobless rate held at 9.1 percent, the
survey showed.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 1 percent to
1,352.38 at 12:43 p.m. in New York. Treasuries fell, pushing up
the yield on the benchmark 10-year note to 3.15 percent from
3.11 percent late yesterday.  The Labor Department said today that first-time
applications for  unemployment insurance  fell while remaining at
a level that shows the labor market will take time to heal.
Jobless claims dropped by 14,000 to 418,000 in the week ended
July 2, in line with the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  An unemployment rate that’s slow to decline is restraining
confidence. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index decreased to
minus 45.5 for the period ended July 3 from minus 43.9 the prior
week. The drop was within the survey’s 3-point margin of error.  Views on Economy  All three components in the Bloomberg survey fell. An index
of consumers’ views of the economy decreased to minus 80.9, the
worst showing since the week ended April 3, from minus 79.2 the
prior week.  The gauge of personal finances declined to minus 8.4, the
lowest in four weeks, while the buying climate measure was
little changed at minus 47.1.  The ADP figures followed an Institute for Supply Management
report last week that showed manufacturing in June unexpectedly
accelerated.  Gains in stocks today were led by retailers and banks.
Limited Brands Inc. and Gap Inc. advanced at least 3.1 percent
after last month’s sales surpassed analysts’ projections as
discounts, warmer weather and lower gas prices in the U.S.
enticed consumers to spend.  ‘Soft’ Backdrop  “The data up to this point have been coming in a little
better than expected,” said Neil Dutta, an economist at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in  New York . “We’re still in a soft
economic backdrop, but on the bright side it’s not getting any
worse. Any weakness we saw in the May employment report is not
going to linger into June.”  The median estimate of 36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
for the ADP report was based on projections that ranged from
40,000 to 175,000.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in February, when it understated the gain in jobs by
5,000. The estimate was least accurate in December, when it
overestimated the increase in employment by 184,000.  Today’s report showed an increase of 27,000 workers in
goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and
construction companies. Employment at factories increased 24,000
jobs. Service providers added 130,000 workers in June, the
figures showed.  Companies employing more than 499 workers added 10,000
jobs. Employment at medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499
employees, rose 59,000 and small companies increased payrolls by
88,000, ADP said.  ‘Back on Track’  “While we’ve had these couple of bumps, we believe that
the recovery will be back on track despite the slow housing
market and stubborn levels of unemployment,”  Don Johnson , vice
president of U.S. sales for General Motors Co., said on a July 1
teleconference with analysts. “When you look at the reasons for
the slowdown, we have to recognize that the Japan crisis was
contributing to that slowdown.”  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
companies with more than 21 million workers on payrolls.
