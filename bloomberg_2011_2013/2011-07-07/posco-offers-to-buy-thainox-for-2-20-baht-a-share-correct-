(Corrects holding size in fourth paragraph.)  Posco (005490) , the world’s third-largest
steelmaker, offered to buy the shares it doesn’t already own in
Thailand’s  Thainox Stainless Pcl (INOX)  for 2.20 baht apiece.  Posco, which owns 15 percent of Thainox, offered to buy a
stake held by Thailand’s Mahagitsiri family, and will tender for
the remaining shares at the same price, Thainox said today in a
regulatory filing. The family owns about 59 percent of the
company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The agreement ends more than three years of negotiations
between Posco and Thailand’s largest maker of rust-proof steel.
The Pohang, South Korea-based steelmaker failed to reach an
accord with the company’s biggest shareholder in December 2009
because they couldn’t agree on terms.  The stake in Thainox that Posco doesn’t already own is
valued at about 12.5 billion baht ($412 million) based on the
last-traded price of 1.9 baht before the stock was halted from
trading today on the Thai exchange. Thainox shares jumped 12
percent to 2.12 baht when they resumed trading in Bangkok.  Thainox reported net income of 643 million baht in 2010, a
59 percent increase from a year earlier. The company had a net
loss of 1.16 billion baht in 2008, its first since 2001,
according to a data compiled by Bloomberg.  The family gained control of the steelmaker in 2004 after
buying a 96 percent stake from Arcelor SA, then the world’s
biggest steelmaker.  Thainox will have to sell land that foreign companies
aren’t allowed to own under  Thailand  Board of Investment rules,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
