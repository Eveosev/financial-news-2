Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced, snapping
two days of losses, as global funds boosted holdings of the
nation’s assets to benefit from its growth outlook.  Offshore investors bought $59 million more Indonesian
shares than they sold in the first three days of the week,
according to exchange data, after Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor
Hartadi Sarwono said July 4 the economy will expand 6.6 percent
this year, compared with 6.1 percent in 2010. Overseas  holdings 
of the country’s government bonds rose 4.3 percent last month to
234.99 trillion rupiah ($27.5 billion), debt management office
data show, as consumer prices eased for a fifth month in June.  “The economy is doing well and  Bank Indonesia  is also
allowing the rupiah to appreciate to dampen some of the
inflationary pressure,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-
exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in  Singapore .  The rupiah appreciated 0.2 percent to 8,536 per dollar as
of 9:35 a.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It has rallied 5.2 percent this year. The currency will reach
8,500 by the end of the third quarter, Saktiandi forecast.  Inflation cooled to 5.54 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with 5.98 percent in May, according to data
released July 1.  Ten-year benchmark bonds rose for a seventh day, the
longest winning streak since April. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 7.39 percent, according to prices from the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
