Two North Korean players failed drug
tests at the  Women’s World Cup  in  Germany , soccer’s governing
body said.  Song Jong Sun and Jong Pok Sim were provisionally suspended
before yesterday’s game against Colombia in Bochum, FIFA said in
a statement, without identifying which substances they tested
positive for. The two had been tested after the team’s previous
matches and the results received yesterday morning.  As a result, the entire North Korean team was tested after
yesterday’s game, FIFA said. North Korea failed to advance out
of the group stage.  Colombian goalkeeper Yineth Varon was suspended June 28
after a positive out-of-competition drug test three days
earlier. She requested her second sample be tested, which
confirmed the first, and disciplinary proceedings have now been
opened against her, FIFA said, without identifying the
substance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
