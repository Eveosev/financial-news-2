Kuwait National Airlines Co. (KNA)  K.S.C.
faces lawsuits from banks and owes  Burgan Bank (BURG)  about 16 million
dinars ($58 million), Kuwait National’s Chairman Abdul Salam al-
Bahar said.  “The banks have filed lawsuits and they’re demanding
legal measures against the company,” al-Bahar told reporters
today. He didn’t name the banks.  Kuwait National also owes  Kuwait International Bank (KIB)  5
million dinars, al-Bahar said at the company’s headquarters at
Kuwait International Airport. Al-Bahar spoke after the
postponement of an extraordinary shareholders meeting.  Kuwait National said last month it failed to reach a
settlement with Aviation Lease & Finance Co., known as Alafco,
on the payment of $70 million for an aircraft leasing deal.  Shareholders in Kuwait National Airlines, the holding
company that owns Wataniya Airways, in May postponed a vote on
raising the company’s capital to 65 million dinars, pending
agreement by the company on Alafco’s demands. Kuwaiti carrier
Wataniya Airways halted operations in March, two years after
starting up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
