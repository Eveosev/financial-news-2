Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Taiwan trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 1:30 p.m. in Taipei.  The Taiex Index fell 51.02, or 0.6 percent, to 8,773.42.  Asustek Computer Inc. (2357)  (2357 TT) dropped 3.1 percent to
NT$284, the biggest drop since April 29. The low-cost computer
maker probably didn’t meet its target for second-quarter sales
to rise as much as 5 percent from the first quarter because of
weak demand in China and  Europe , the Commercial Times reported,
without saying where it got the information. Chief Financial
Officer  David Chang  didn’t immediately answer calls to his
office or return messages left for him.  HTC Corp. (2498)  (2498 TT) sank 6.9 percent to NT$1,020, the
biggest loss since June 15, after the company agreed to purchase
S3 Graphics Co. for $300 million. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating
on the company to “sell” from “buy,” citing concerns about
the acquisition and slower smartphone growth next year.  Quanta Computer Inc. (2382)  (2382 TT) lost 2.3 percent to
NT$69.40. The world’s largest laptop maker expects losses of not
more than NT$60 million after an employee embezzled funds, the
company said in a statement to the stock exchange yesterday.  Pegatron Corp. (4938)  (4938 TT) surged 6.9 percent to NT$31.95,
the biggest advance since Aug. 24, on speculation the company
may get a boost to profit from the third quarter if it wins
Apple Inc. iPhone orders, said Claire Su, an analyst at Fubon
Securities Co.  Pegatron, which posted a loss of NT$559 million in the
first quarter, may have won an order for 15 million iPhone 5
handsets, the DigiTimes reported on July 5. Chief Financial
Officer Charles Lin couldn’t be reached immediately for comment
at his office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
