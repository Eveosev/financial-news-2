South African net gold and foreign
currency reserves rose 2.8 percent last month as the central
bank bought up dollars brought into the country by foreign
investors.  Net reserves climbed to $47.2 billion from $45.9 billion in
May, the Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  said on its website today.
That was in line with the median estimate of five analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The jump in reserves was the result of “a substantial
increase in the forward position, reflecting foreign-direct
investment-related foreign exchange purchases,” the central
bank said.  The Reserve Bank has been buying foreign currency following
a surge in the rand that has undermined the competitiveness of
 South Africa ’s exports. The rand has gained almost 40 percent
against the dollar since the beginning of 2009.  “The Reserve Bank is likely to continue to accumulate
foreign exchange reserves during times of rand appreciation,”
Nedbank Group Ltd., the country’s fourth-largest bank, said in
e-mailed comments. “These figures have little direct
implication for monetary policy.”  The rand traded at 6.7305 per dollar at 8:31 a.m. in
Johannesburg, up from 6.7452 before the release of the reserves
data.  “There is no silver bullet” for addressing the rand’s
strength, Deputy Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene told reporters
in  Cape Town  on June 29. “In the past year, we have actually
spent in excess of 50 billion rand in trying to make sure that
we accumulate adequate foreign reserves. The interventions
continue.”  Gross reserves declined 0.7 percent in June to $50 billion,
as the price of bullion fell 1.8 percent to an average of
$1,508.22 an ounce and reduced the value of the country’s gold
reserves by $109 million to $6.06 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
