Banco Industrial e Comercial SA (BICB3) , the
Sao Paulo-based lender known as BicBanco, rose the most in a
week after saying it will buy back as much as 10 percent of its
preferred shares outstanding.  BicBanco gained 0.9 percent to 9.65 reais at the close of
 Sao Paulo  trading at 4:15 p.m. New York time. The Bovespa index
fell 0.6 percent to 62,207.33.  “It’s a sign that management is confident in the outlook
for the bank’s business, and that at current prices it’s worth
buying shares,” Marco Saravalle, an equity analyst at
Coinvalores Corretora de Valores in Sao Paulo, said in a
telephone interview.  BicBanco plans to repurchase as many as 6.88 million of its
preferred shares outstanding, according to a regulatory filing.
The stock fell 32 percent this year through yesterday, the
sixth-worst performance in the 73-member  BM&FBovespa Small Cap (SMLLBV) 
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
