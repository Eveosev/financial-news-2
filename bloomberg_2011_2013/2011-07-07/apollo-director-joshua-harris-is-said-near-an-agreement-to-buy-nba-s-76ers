The Philadelphia 76ers likely will be
sold to a group led by Joshua Harris, a director at Apollo
Global Management LLC, in the next few business days, two people
familiar with the negotiations said.  Harris will pay about $280 million, according to one of the
people, who were granted anonymity because they weren’t
authorized to discuss the sale publicly. Harris  co-founded 
 Apollo Management  in 1990, and holds a bachelor’s degree from
the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business and
a master’s degree from the Harvard Business School.  Apollo went public in March.  Comcast-Spectacor, the holding company that owns the
National Basketball Association team, said a month ago that it
was exploring a sale.  Harris’s group includes  David Blitzer , who moved to London
from  New York  in 2002 to create the European office of the
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) , the biggest private-equity firm.  Michael Preston, a spokesman for the 76ers, declined to
comment. Ike Richman, spokesman for Comcast-Spectacor, didn’t
immediately respond to a voice mail left at his office or an e-
mail. Neither Harris nor Blitzer immediately responded to e-
mails seeking comment.  Comcast-Spectacor also owns hockey’s  Philadelphia Flyers 
and the Wells Fargo Center, where both clubs play. The 76ers’
deal doesn’t include the hockey team or arena, which will still
be operated by the holding company.  The 76ers finished 41-41 last season, seventh in the
Eastern Conference.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
