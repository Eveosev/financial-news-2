The cost of insuring bonds in
Australia and  Japan  against non-payment increased, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index climbed 1 basis point to
113 basis points as of 10:03 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 0.5 basis
point to 125.5 basis points as of 9:01 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche
Bank AG prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1 basis points to 113 as of 8:13
a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc. prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
