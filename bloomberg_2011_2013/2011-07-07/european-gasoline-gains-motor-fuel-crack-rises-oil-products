Vitol Group bought jet fuel barges in
northwest  Europe  for at least the fourth day. Gasoil futures and
spot gasoline for immediate loading advanced.  Petroplus Holdings AG halted its BRC refinery in Antwerp,
 Belgium , early this week for planned maintenance, according to a
union official.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded from $1,015 to $1,023 a metric ton, according to a survey
of traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That
compares with yesterday’s deals from $998 to $1,010 a ton.  The trades are for Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added
before being sold to motorists and are typically for lots of
1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  The fuel’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , increased to
$7.44 a barrel from $7.07 yesterday, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., an oil and refined products broker in London.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent narrowed to $6.54 a barrel from
$6.94 yesterday, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  Jet fuel barges traded twice at $1,054 a ton, according to
a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing
window which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. That’s $30 higher
than yesterday’s deals.  Gasoil for July delivery advanced 3.6 percent to $962.75 a
ton as of 5:48 p.m. local time on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange. That’s the highest price since June 10. Gasoil is used
in heating.  Gasoil’s crack, a measure of refining profitability,
widened to $12.07 a barrel at 4:30 p.m.  London  time from $11.77
yesterday, according to ICE data. Brent for August climbed 3.5
percent to $117.56 a barrel.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil barges traded from $636.50 to $643 a
ton, higher than yesterday’s deals from $624 to $626.50,
according to the survey of Platts. The low-sulfur grade changed
hands from $690 to $693 a ton. That compares with $681.50 to
$682.50 traded yesterday.  Refinery News  Petroplus’s Antwerp facility was scheduled to resume
operations on July 11, Herman Baele, an ABVV union official,
said by phone today. “It is not sure that the refinery will
restart next week,” he said earlier in an e-mail. “There are a
lot of problems on a security level for the restart.”  The refinery can process 110,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
