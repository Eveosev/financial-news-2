U.K. Energy Secretary Chris Huhne
comments on U.K. power-generation policy. He spoke today on BBC
Radio 4’s “Today” program before a planned meeting with
electricity providers other than Britain’s so-called Big Six.  About 99 percent of U.K. consumers are supplied by Centrica
Plc, EON AG, Scottish & Southern Energy Plc, Iberdrola SA’s
Scottish Power, Electricite de France SA and RWE AG’s Npower
unit, according to the Department of Energy and Climate Change.
Aside from these suppliers, at least six smaller companies
provide power to the remaining 1 percent of consumers.  On U.K. power market:  “We have six companies that are completely dominant. When
you get a market that’s as cozy as that, there are questions
about competition.”  Smaller providers “can supply electricity as well as
anyone else.”  On nuclear power generation:  “It’s part of our energy mix.”  “It’s a mature technology. There is no justification for
subsidizing nuclear.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
