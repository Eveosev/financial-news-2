Estonian consumer-price growth was
the slowest in eight months in June as food-price increases
eased.  Consumer prices rose 4.9 percent from a year earlier, the
Tallinn-based statistics office said on its website today. That
compares with a 5.4 percent increase in May. Prices were
unchanged on the month in June from the previous period.  Annual inflation may slow from “autumn” as global food
prices decline and crop forecasts are improving, the  Finance
Ministry  said last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
