Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg 
urged Britain not to indulge in triumphalism over the euro
area’s debt crisis and said all countries should pursue policies
to spur growth.  “The U.K. should not see ourselves as spectators, watching
from the wings, triumphalist, complacent, as if  Europe ’s
economic woes are a euro-zone problem, rather than a problem for
all of us,” Clegg will say in a speech in Paris today,
according to extracts released by his office. “As if it is
enough to put your own house in order, but then stand by
and let the neighborhood crumble.”  Europe’s debt plight comes as Britain’s export-driven
recovery shows signs of waning, with the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research saying yesterday the economy
probably grew just 0.1 percent between April and June after
stagnating over the previous two quarters.  European finance ministers earlier this month authorized
an 8.7 billion-euro ($12 billion) loan payout to  Greece  in an
attempt to avert the region’s first sovereign default. Standard
& Poor’s and Fitch Ratings have both indicated they would cut
Greece to default if leaders went ahead with a plan to ask
creditors to roll over expiring Greek bonds into new debt.  “Events both inside and outside of the eurozone have
demonstrated the irrefutable need for all European states to
pursue deep-seated economic reform, individually and together,
because without it there will be no lasting success,” Clegg
will say.  To contact the reporter on this story:
