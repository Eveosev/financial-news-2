Brazil  is planning to sell $500
million more of its 4.875 percent bonds due 2021 as it seeks to
take advantage of the lowest borrowing costs in seven months.  The securities, which may be sold as soon as today, will
yield 105 basis points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the transaction.
Brazil hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Banco Santander SA to
manage the sale, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because terms aren’t set.  Brazil’s government is selling dollar bonds overseas for
the first time since September as it cuts spending and raises
 interest rates  to contain inflation following the fastest
economic growth in two decades. The yield on the country’s 4.875
percent notes due in 2021 has tumbled 51 basis points, or 0.51
percentage point, this year to 4.1 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The bonds fell to 3.99 percent on June
24, the lowest since November.  Brazil was upgraded to Baa2, the second-lowest investment
grade, from Baa3 by Moody’s Investors Service last month,
following a boost by  Fitch Ratings  in April. Fitch rates  Latin
America ’s largest economy an equivalent BBB.  The offer follows Latin American sovereign dollar debt
sales earlier this year from Colombia and  Mexico . Brazilian
companies have sold $29.5 billion of bonds this year, and are on
pace to surpass last year’s record issuance, Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
