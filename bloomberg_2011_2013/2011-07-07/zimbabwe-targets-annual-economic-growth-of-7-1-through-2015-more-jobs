Zimbabwe is targeting average
economic growth of 7.1 percent a year for the next five years
and to add 6 percent more jobs annually, said Tapiwa Mashakada,
the country’s economic planning minister.  The “medium term plan” also calls for the government to
sell stakes in unprofitable state companies, such as Air
Zimbabwe, the national carrier, Mashakada said in a speech in
Harare, the capital, today.  Zimbabwe’s economy emerged from a decade of recession in
2009 after President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front and the Movement for Democratic Change,
led by Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai , formed a coalition
government. The state scrapped the Zimbabwe dollar two years ago
after inflation climbed to 500 billion percent, according to the
 International Monetary Fund .  About “$9.2 billion total investment is required to
finance the MTP in order to meet the growth and development
targets,” he said. “It is important to note that most of the
inflows are anticipated to come through our own savings and
investment efforts, foreign direct investment, credit lines and
public private partnerships.”  The southern African country’s economy shrank more than 50
percent from 2000 to 2008, according to the IMF. The
 unemployment rate  is estimated at about 70 percent, with about a
third of people with jobs working for the government, Harare-
based economist  John Robertson  said April 18.  Zimbabwe has the second-biggest reserves of platinum and
chrome after neighboring South Africa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
