Japan ’s sales of gear for making
semiconductors will increase more than expected this year,
helped by demand for memory used in mobile phones, digital
cameras and portable music players, an industry group said.  Sales of chip manufacturing machinery will rise 9 percent
to 1.35 trillion yen ($16.7 billion) in the 12 months through
March 2012 from a year earlier, the Semiconductor Equipment
 Association of Japan  forecast today in a statement. The group in
January estimated that sales of the equipment would rise 4.5
percent in the current fiscal year.  The forecast for higher sales reflects an improved outlook
for chip gear makers such as Applied Materials Inc. and  Tokyo
Electron Ltd. (8035) , which faced delayed sales after disruptions to
the supply of electronic parts in the wake of the March 11
earthquake in Japan. The companies may also receive a boost from
the popularity of tablet computers, such as Apple Inc.’s iPad.  Revenue from machines that make flat-panel displays will
decline 8.9 percent to 350 billion yen, SEAJ said, citing a
delay in investments into large panel production by TV
manufacturers. The group in January forecast sales to slide 5.1
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
