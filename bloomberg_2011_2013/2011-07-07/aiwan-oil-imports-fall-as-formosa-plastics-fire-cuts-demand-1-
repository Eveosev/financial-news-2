Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its crude oil needs, purchased less of the fuel in
June after a fire at Formosa Plastics Group cut demand.  Crude shipments declined 24 percent from a year earlier to
22.8 million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
Taipei today. The island’s June oil bill climbed 14 percent to
$2.58 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Formosa Plastics Group, the island’s biggest diversified
industrial company, halted some plants at its Mailiao complex
after a fire on May 12, according to statements from its units.
Taiwan’s petroleum and coal-product output fell 13 percent in
May from a year earlier, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said
on June 23.  To contact the reporters on this story:
