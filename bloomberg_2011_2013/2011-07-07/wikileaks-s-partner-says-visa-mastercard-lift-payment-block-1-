WikiLeaks’s payment provider,
DataCell, said it’s again able to accept credit-card payments
seven months after Visa  Europe  Ltd. and  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  blocked
donations to the website.  DataCell is using an alternative-payment gateway to process
money sent through MasterCard, the world’s second-largest
payments network, and Visa Europe, which runs the largest card
network in the European Union, Reykjavik, Iceland-based DataCell
 said in a statement today .  “DataCell is happy to report that we are now able again to
process donations to WikiLeaks,” the company said. “We choose
to interpret this as that Visa and MasterCard has in fact given
in to our demand” to reinstate the service.  MasterCard’s website was attacked by hackers last month and
in December after the Purchase, New York-based firm and Visa
Europe blocked WikiLeaks from using its network to collect funds
from donors. WikiLeaks, led by Julian Assange, publishes secret
documents, including confidential U.S. diplomatic and military
information. The December attack on MasterCard was orchestrated
by hacker group Anonymous, TechCrunch reported at the time.  Amanda Kamin, a spokeswoman for London-based Visa Europe,
denied that the firm had changed its policy on WikiLeaks
donations. “We have not reinstated DataCell and are looking
into how transactions are being made,” Kamin said in an e-
mailed statement.  James Issokson, a New York-based spokesman for MasterCard,
didn’t return e-mails or phone calls seeking comment.  American Express  DataCell is also able to process WikiLeaks donations made
through  American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest credit-card issuer by
customer spending, according to the statement. Christine Elliott, a spokeswoman for New York-based AmEx, didn’t return e-
mails and phone calls seeking comment.  At about 4:20 p.m. New York time, the WikiLeaks Twitter
account, which has almost 1 million followers, posted a message
about the “Financial block workaround.”  “Donate whilst you can Visa, MasterCard and AmEx,” read
the rest of the message, which linked back to the WikiLeaks
website.  In December, the U.S. Justice Department subpoenaed Twitter
Inc. to hand over data about users with ties to WikiLeaks.  PayPal, a unit of  EBay Inc. (EBAY) , the world’s largest online
marketplace, also suspended payments to the website in December.
PayPal hasn’t lifted its block, company spokesman Anuj Nayar
said in a phone interview.  “Nothing has changed regarding being able to take
WikiLeaks donations via PayPal,” Nayar said.  Assange Defence Fund  PayPal still accepts donations for the Julian Assange
Defence Fund through a company called FundRazr, according to
Nayar. The fund was created by Assange’s defense team and
receives contributions to help defend the WikiLeaks leader,
according to a Facebook  application .  Visa Inc. (V) ’s supension of payments to Wikileaks is still in
place, spokeswoman Erica Harvill said in an e-mailed statement.
Visa Europe split from Visa Inc. before the San Francisco-based
company’s initial public offering in 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
