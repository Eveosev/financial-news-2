The financial turmoil that’s swollen
the ranks of the unemployed in  Europe  may be to blame for a
growing number of suicides.  Scientists studying the link between economic downturns,
joblessness and mortality over the past three decades said an
early look at data for 2009 shows suicides increased in nine
European countries in the year after the crisis began. Their
comments were published today in the medical journal  The Lancet .  Greece and Ireland, the countries hurt most by the 2008
banking crisis and sovereign debt problems, had bigger increases
in suicide rates. The data suggests job troubles have caused
widespread despair, one of the scientists said in an interview.  “Suicides are just the tip of the iceberg in front of an
increase in depression,” said  David Stuckler  of the University
of Cambridge. “We’re seeing signs of a mental health crisis.”  Every increase of 1 percent in the unemployment rate is
associated with an 0.8 percent rise in suicides by people
younger than 65, Stuckler wrote in a 2009 Lancet article that
culled data from 26 EU countries over more than three decades.
More joblessness was also linked to an increase in murders and a
drop in traffic fatalities.  Stuckler and his colleagues said they had seen a “steady
downward trend” in suicide rates in the years before 2007,
which “reversed at once” as unemployment surged by about 35
percent in European Union member nations between 2007 and 2009.  Greek Unemployment  The level of unemployment in  Greece  has almost doubled to
16.2 percent since 2008, according to Bloomberg data. Suicides
there increased 19 percent to a total of 391 between 2007 and
2009, according to Stuckler. The government last week agreed to
cut 78 billion euros ($112 billion) in spending to get the fifth
installment of an international bailout package aimed at
lowering borrowing costs in a country where debt may rise to 158
percent of gross domestic product this year, according to EU
forecasts.  In Ireland, the number of suicides rose 15 percent over the
same period to 527 as unemployment almost tripled since the
first quarter of 2008. Ireland’s unemployment now stands at 14.1
percent as the government works to narrow its  budget deficit .
The state has been locked out of credit markets after investors
became wary of the cost of bailing out its banking sector.  “To the extent that cuts are now being contemplated to
effective mental  health services  and job reintegration programs,
there’s a real possibility that those measures could exacerbate
the risks,” Stuckler said.  Austrian Data  Out of the 10 European nations for which 2009 data was
available, only  Austria  had fewer suicides compared with 2007,
according to the scientists. In each of the other countries, the
number of suicides increased by at least 5 percent.  In the U.K., the number of suicides rose almost 9 percent
to 4,245 in 2009 from 2007, according to Stuckler.  Since the 2008 downturn began, about 7 percent of more than
2,000 workers surveyed in England and  Wales  had started taking
antidepressants for “problems directly caused by the pressures
of recession on their workplace,” such as longer hours and low
morale, according to research published last year by  Mind , a
U.K.-based mental health charity.  The British  unemployment rate  has remained above 7.5
percent for about two years, compared with a rate of 5.5 percent
in January 2007, according to the U.K. Office for National
Statistics. The jobless rate probably won’t drop below 7.5
percent until 2013, according to the median estimate of 12
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
