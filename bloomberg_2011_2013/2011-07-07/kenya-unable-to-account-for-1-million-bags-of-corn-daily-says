Kenya â€™s government is unable to
account for as much as 1 million 90-kilogram (198.4 pounds) bags
of corn from the last harvest, amid suspicions that the grain
may have been smuggled to neighboring Southern Sudan, Business
Daily reported.  The East African nation, which consumes 3.5 million bags of
the grain annually, had 8.5 million bags at the end of June,
compared with 13 million bags a month earlier, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing the Agriculture Ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
