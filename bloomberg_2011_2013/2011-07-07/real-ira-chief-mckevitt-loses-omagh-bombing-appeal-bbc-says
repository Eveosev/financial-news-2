The leader of the Real  Irish
Republican Army  lost an appeal against a civil court ruling that
held him liable for the 1998 Omagh bombing that killed 29
people, the  British Broadcasting Corp.  reported.  The appeal court in Belfast upheld a ruling against Michael McKevitt, the  BBC  said. Judge Malachy Higgins directed a retrial
in the case of Colm Murphy, one of three other men originally
held liable, and will hear arguments on a retrial of another,
Seamus Daly, according to the report. The ruling was also upheld
against Liam Campbell, the BBC said.  The 2009 ruling found that the four men were liable for the
bombing and awarded relatives of the victims 1.6 million pounds
($2.6 million) in damages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
