The Philippine peso rose for an
eighth day, its longest winning streak since January, after the
central bank said the nation’s international reserves may
increase.  Foreign-currency holdings may exceed $70 billion this year,
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco said
yesterday. The reserves were at a record $69 billion at the end
of June, according to official data today.  “Risk appetite has subsided but people are becoming picky
on which currency to buy,” said Rafael Algarra, a treasurer at
Security Bank Corp. in  Manila . “Philippine growth prospects are
good and higher reserves are boosting our macro fundamentals.”  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 42.880 per dollar at the 4 p.m.
close in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
42.790 earlier, the strongest level since May 3.  Benchmark five-year bonds dropped. The yield on the 7
percent notes due January 2016 rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 4.72 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services.  To contact the reporter for this story:
