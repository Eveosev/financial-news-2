The lira strengthened for the first
time in five days as the central bank reduced lending to slow
the currency’s depreciation.  The currency appreciated as much as 0.3 percent before
paring its rise to less than 0.1 percent at 1.7884 per dollar as
of 2:54 p.m. in Istanbul. It weakened 2.4 percent in the past
four days.  Yields (BENCH)  on the two-year benchmark debt declined two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.38 percent,
according to a  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK)  index.  The central bank has reduced the amount it lends at its
lowest benchmark rate of 5.75 percent for the third day. The
last time it lent 7 billion liras, the upper end of its lending
range, was on March 2. It lent 6 billion liras and 5 billion
liras on March 6 and March 5, respectively, and 3 billion liras
today.  “We can conclude the central bank is displeased with the
recent depreciation of the lira,” Ali Cakiroglu, a strategist
at  HSBC Private Bank  in Istanbul, said in a note.  Turkey ’s inflation rate fell to 10.4 percent in February
from a three-year peak of 10.6 percent a month earlier, the
statistics agency in Ankara said. The central bank’s target for
2012 inflation is 5 percent.  The country’s current-account deficit narrowed in the last
two months of 2012 after a credit-fueled boom led to a surge in
imports that pushed the 12-month  trade gap  to a record $78.6
billion in October. The deficit is still about 10 percent of
gross domestic product.  The lira slumped 18 percent last year in the biggest
decline worldwide, as Turkish inflation increased to more than
double the central bank’s target and the current-account gap
widened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
