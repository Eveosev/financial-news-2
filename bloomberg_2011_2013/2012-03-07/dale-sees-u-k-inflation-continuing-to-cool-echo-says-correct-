Bank of England Chief Economist
 Spencer Dale  said he expects U.K. inflation to slow to the
central bank’s 2 percent target by the end of the year, easing
the squeeze on Britons.  “With high inflation their ability to spend in the shops
has been squeezed and hopefully that pressure will start to ease
and people will start to feel better,” Dale said in an
interview with BBC Radio Gloucestershire. The comments were
originally broadcast on March 1.  “I think inflation will continue to fall” from its
January level of 3.6 percent, which was a 14-month low, Dale
said. “Hopefully inflation will gradually come back down over
the rest of the year to our inflation target of 2 percent.”  Dale also said he has “huge empathy” with savers as the
 Bank of England  continues to hold its  benchmark interest rate  at
a record low of 0.5 percent.  “This is a group who did nothing in any way to fuel the
financial crisis but who have suffered very significantly in
bearing the burden of low interest rates,” he said. “We all
stand to gain if we can get the economy back to a position of
strong and sustainable growth with low and stable inflation.  ‘‘ Monetary policy , trying to stimulate the economy, is a
key part of getting the economy back onto a stable and balanced
path,’’ he said.  While there is ‘‘hope that we should start to get some
pickup in growth’’ later this year, ‘‘things are still very
uncertain, particularly for those who are exposed to what’s
going on in the euro-area,’’ Dale said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
