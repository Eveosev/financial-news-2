Palm oil  may rally to 4,000 ringgit
per metric ton by the end of June as global edible-oil supplies
tighten, according to Dorab Mistry, director at Godrej
International Ltd., who restated an earlier prediction.  Mistry, whoâ€™s traded palm oil for more than three decades,
gave the forecast at an industry conference in  Kuala Lumpur 
today. The May-delivery contract ended the morning session at
3,232 ringgit on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
