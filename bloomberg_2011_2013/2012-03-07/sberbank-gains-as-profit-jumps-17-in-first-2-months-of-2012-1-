OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) , Russia’s biggest
lender, rose for the first time in three days in U.S. trading
after reporting that net income in the first two months of the
year climbed 17 percent.  American depositary receipts of Moscow-based Sberbank added
0.8 percent to $13.15 in  New York . They earlier jumped as much
as 1.6 percent, the biggest intraday gain in a week.  Sberbank’s profit during January and February rose to 61.7
billion rubles ($2.1 billion) from the same two-month period
last year, the company said in a statement today. The results
were reported under Russian accounting standards.  “Sberbank has been very actively developing their retail
side, credit cards, loans,” Leonid Slipchenko, a banking
analyst at UralSib Financial Corp., said by phone from Moscow.
“These are very successful developments.”  The state-controlled lender is Alfa Bank’s top pick among
Russian banks, according to Jason Hurwitz, a Moscow-based
analyst for Alfa.  “Sberbank has sustainable funding advantages, primarily
they are the only bank that is a distribution agent for the
Russian pension system,” Hurwitz said by phone today.  Sberbank added 0.2 percent to 97.53 rubles, or the
equivalent of $3.28, on  Russia ’s Micex Index today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
