Cereal and rapeseed planting in
England and  Wales  rose 5 percent as of Dec. 1 compared with the
prior year on favorable autumn weather, the Home-Grown Cereals
Authority said.  Seeding of cereals and rapeseed increased to 2.98 million
hectares (7.37 million acres), the HGCA said in an e-mailed
report today. Wheat area gained 3 percent to 1.86 million
hectares and barley seeding gained 9 percent to 345,000
hectares. Rapeseed was planted on 698,000 hectares, up 6
percent, the Warwickshire, England-based authority said.  “The expansion in area comes following generally favorable
autumn weather conditions in 2011, which allowed plantings to
progress,” the HGCA said. “Against other winter sown crops,
oilseed rape has become increasingly competitive over the last
two seasons, fueled partly by a tight European supply.”  Wheat on NYSE Liffe in  London  has gained 8.8 percent this
year on speculation demand will increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
