Companies in the U.S. added more
workers in February than a month earlier, another sign of labor
market strength, data from a private report based on payrolls
showed today.  Employment increased by 216,000 for the month after a
revised 173,000 gain in January, according to figures from ADP
Employer Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News
survey called for a 215,000 increase this month.  Further employment gains would help generate the wage gains
necessary to sustain household spending, which accounts for
about 70 percent of the economy. Businesses added 225,000 jobs
in February, and the  unemployment rate  held at 8.3 percent,
economists project a Labor Department report will show in two
days.  “Everything is pointing to broader employment gains,”
Troy Davig, a senior U.S. economist at Barclays Capital Inc. in
 New York , said before the report. “As people start experiencing
a steadier stream of income, that will translate into
consumption and that will start building a stronger foundation
for growth.”  Estimates ranged from increases of 120,000 to 270,000,
according to the Bloomberg survey of 44 economists.  Stocks rose, following the biggest drop in 2012 for the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The  S&P 500  climbed 0.3 percent to
1,347.3 at 10:21 a.m. in New York.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in October, when it overstated the gain in jobs by
6,000. The estimate was least accurate in December, when it
overestimated the employment gain by 113,000.  Factory Jobs  Today’s ADP report showed an increase of 46,000 workers in
goods-producing industries, which includes manufacturers and
construction companies. Employment at factories rose by 21,000.  Service providers added 170,000 workers, ADP said.  Companies employing more than 499 workers expanded their
workforces by 20,000 jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to
499 employees, created 88,000 jobs and small companies increased
payrolls by 108,000, ADP said.  Overall payrolls, which include government workers,
probably rose by 210,000 in February, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the Labor
Department’s March 9 report.  Even with “positive developments” in the job market,
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told lawmakers last
week that the “modest and uneven” expansion needs the support
of monetary policy. The central bank said in January that
economic conditions are likely to warrant low  interest rates  at
least through late 2014.  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
businesses employing more than 21 million workers. Macroeconomic
