David Clarkson, Ryan Carter and
Patrik Elias all scored in the third period as the host  New
Jersey  Devils defeated the National Hockey League-leading  New
York Rangers  4-1.  The Rangers are tied with the  St. Louis Blues  with 91
points atop the NHL standings. They lead the Eastern Conference
by eight points over the  Pittsburgh Penguins .  Ilya Kovalchuk gave the Devils a 1-0 lead in the first
period last night at the Prudential Center in Newark, New
Jersey, with his 26th goal of the season. Martin Brodeur had 25
saves for the Devils (37-24-5).  “This was a big game for us because we weren’t very sharp
lately,” Kovalchuk told reporters. “We need these points right
now and wins against teams as good as the Rangers are huge.”  Derek Stepan scored in the second period for the only goal
for the Rangers (42-16-7), who are 13-4-3 in their last 20 games
and 20-9-5 on the road. Henrik Lundqvist stopped 25 of 28 shots.  “We had way too many mistakes out there,” Lundqvist said.
“I think we kind of beat ourselves a little bit. But we just
have to work through this and stick together. They made some
good plays when we had some breakdowns.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
