An Iranian general was designated a
narcotics trafficker by the U.S. Treasury Department, which
froze any assets he may have in the U.S.  The Treasury identified the general as Gholamreza Baghbani
of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qods Force. The
unit’s involvement in drug trafficking “is done as part of a
broader scheme to support terrorism,” according to a statement
by Undersecretary of the Treasury  David Cohen .  With today’s action, “U.S. persons are prohibited from
conducting financial or commercial transactions with General
Baghbani and any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction are
frozen,” the Treasury said.
