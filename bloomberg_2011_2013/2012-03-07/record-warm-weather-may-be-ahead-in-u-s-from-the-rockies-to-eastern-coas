Temperature records may fall as the
U.S. and  Canada  warm up from the Rocky Mountains to the East
Coast next week, forecasters said.  New York, Chicago and Washington may be as much as 15
degrees Fahrenheit (8 Celsius) above normal from March 12 to
March 16, said  MDA EarthSat Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland.
The warmth may extend from the upper Great Plains to eastern
Quebec, according to MDA’s 6- to 10-day forecast.  “Nearly all of the models favor this warmth, which is
likely to set new records across parts of the Midwest,” MDA
said.  Traders watch temperature predictions to gauge energy use
and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use natural gas
for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Temperatures in  Chicago  may be 18 degrees above normal from
March 13 to March 17, according to  David Salmon , owner of
Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.  From March 17 to March 21, temperatures from the upper
Great Plains to the mid-Atlantic and New England coasts will
remain 15 degrees above normal, Commodity Weather Group LLC
President  Matt Rogers  said in his 11- to 15-day forecast.  Rogers, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said there is a chance
the East Coast may be a bit cooler in the period, with at least
one model favoring that outcome.  The normal average temperature in New York for today is
about 40 degrees, according to MDA. It’s 36 in Boston, 41 in
Philadelphia, 35 in Chicago, 43 in  St. Louis , 56 in Dallas, 61
in Houston, 52 in Atlanta, 45 in Seattle and 58 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
