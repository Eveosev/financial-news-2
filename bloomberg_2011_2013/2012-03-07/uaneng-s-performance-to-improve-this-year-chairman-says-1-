Huaneng Power International Inc. (902) ,
the listed unit of China’s largest electricity producer, said
its performance will improve this year after prices rose and the
government capped the cost of coal.  The utility won’t post a loss in the first quarter,
Chairman Cao Peixi told reporters in Beijing today.  Huaneng Power, listed in  Hong Kong , said Jan. 30 it expects
to report a profit decline of more than 50 percent for last
year, based on Chinese accounting standards. China, which
controls utility prices to curb inflation, increased power
prices for the first time in six months on Dec. 1 to help
electricity producers that have posted losses because of rising
fuel costs.  The company’s coal costs probably won’t increase this year,
Cao said.  China  uses coal as fuel at about 80 percent of its
 power plants .  The government has capped prices of coal for immediate
delivery at 800 yuan ($127) a metric ton at nine northern
Chinese ports, including Qinhuangdao, the biggest shipment point
for seaborne supplies, since the start of the year.  Huaneng Power has gained 6.3 percent in the past year,
compared with the 11 percent decline in the Hang Seng Index. The
 stock  fell 1.1 percent to HK$4.73 as of the midday break.  China’s electricity shortage may worsen in the next two to
three years as low profit margins dissuade plants from investing
in new capacity, Cao said. The government should subsidize
utilities for new thermal-power projects, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
