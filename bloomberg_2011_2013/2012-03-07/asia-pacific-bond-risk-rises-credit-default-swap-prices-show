The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index advanced 4 basis points
to 151 basis points as of 11:45 a.m. in Sydney,  Credit Agricole
SA (ACA)  prices show. The gauge is set for its highest close since
Jan. 31, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 4 basis points to 170 as of 8:45
a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole prices show. The index is
headed for its highest close since Feb. 2, according to CMA,
which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index rose 3.5 basis points to 146
basis points as of 9:21 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
