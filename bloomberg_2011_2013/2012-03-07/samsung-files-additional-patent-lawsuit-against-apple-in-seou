Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  said it
filed an additional patent lawsuit against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in Seoul,
deepening a global legal dispute between the world’s two largest
smartphone makers.  Samsung filed the suit yesterday, claiming Apple’s iPhone
4S and iPad 2 infringed patents related to mobile-phone
technologies for features such as displaying user interface and
short messages, Nam Ki Yung, a spokesman for the Suwon, South
Korea-based company said by phone today.  The latest case in Samsung’s local market adds to the
dispute the two  companies  have been locked in globally since the
iPhone maker said in an April suit that the South Korean
company’s Galaxy devices copied its products. Samsung had
previously filed a separate patent suit against Apple in Seoul.  Steve Park , a Seoul-based Apple spokesman, declined to
comment on the new Seoul case.  Samsung earlier today denied a Wall Street Journal report
that Apple offered to settle some pending litigation in exchange
for royalty payments. The two companies both lost patent cases
against each other in a court in Mannheim, Germany on March 2.  Samsung edged out Apple as the top smartphone seller last
year, according to an estimate from  Strategy Analytics .  To contact the reporter on this story:
