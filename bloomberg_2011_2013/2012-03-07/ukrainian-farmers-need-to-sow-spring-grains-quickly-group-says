Ukraine’s farmers will have to sow
spring grains quickly because warmer weather conditions will
arrive late, the country’s Grain Association said, citing Mykola Bezuhlyi, first deputy agriculture minister.  Meteorologists forecast spring’s late arrival will be
followed by rapidly rising temperatures, the industry lobby
group said on its website today, citing the minister.  To contact the reporter on this story:
