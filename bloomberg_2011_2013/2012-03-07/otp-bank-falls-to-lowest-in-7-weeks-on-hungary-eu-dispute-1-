OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell to the lowest in seven weeks on concern the
escalation of the government’s disputes with the European Union
will delay a bailout for the country.  The shares declined as much as 3.8 percent and traded 2.6
percent lower at 3,689 forint by the close in Budapest, the
weakest since Jan. 18.  Disputes with the EU over the independence of the central
bank, the judiciary and the data protection authority have
prevented Hungary from starting talks on a bailout from the bloc
and the  International Monetary Fund , which the government
requested in November. The European Commission today took a
formal step toward seeking a court order to require  Hungary  to
redraft laws, according to a statement in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
