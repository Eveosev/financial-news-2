Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA (USIM5) , the second-largest Brazilian steelmaker by output, posted
fourth-quarter profit that exceeded estimates.  Net income excluding minority interests dropped 84 percent
to 44.6 million reais ($25.4 million), from 285.8 million reais
a year earlier, Usiminas, as the  Belo Horizonte , Brazil-based
company is known, said today in a regulatory filing. The company
was expected to post a net loss excluding some items of 9.1
million reais, the average of five analysts in a Bloomberg
 survey .  Net sales dropped 8.7 percent to 2.82 billion reais in the
period, less than the 10 percent decline in the cost of goods
sold, Usiminas said. Quarterly crude steel output declined 5
percent to 1.51 million metric tons from last year, Usiminas
said.  Steelmakers in Brazil struggled last year as slowing growth
in Latin America’s biggest economy reduced demand from
manufacturers of cars and home appliances. Production of flat-
rolled steel, which Usiminas supplies to carmakers, declined 6.6
percent in Brazil last year, according to the Brazilian Steel
Institute.  Usiminas fell 3 percent to 12.15 reais in Sao Paulo
yesterday, the most since Feb. 10. The stock dropped about 42
percent in the past 12 months. Earnings were released before the
opening of markets.  Gerdau SA (GGBR4) , based in  Porto Alegre , Brazil, is Latin
America’s largest steelmaker.  (Usiminas will host a  conference call  with investors today
at 10 a.m. New York time.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
