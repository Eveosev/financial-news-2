Boeing Co. (BA)  expects to win about 200
orders for the 737 MAX in  China  in 2012, even as the Asian
nation works on developing a competing jet that’s due to enter
service a year earlier.  “We’re out talking to every single airline in China about
the 737 MAX,”  Jim Albaugh , Boeing’s commercial-aircraft chief,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview yesterday in Beijing.
Orders may total “a couple of hundred” 737 MAXs in China this
year and “quite a number” of 747-8s, he said.  Boeing and Airbus SAS are both hunting for the first sales
of their in-development narrow-body jets in China, the world’s
fastest-growing aviation market, while the planned C919 from
state-backed  Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China  has amassed
about 225 orders and commitments there. The three planemakers
may eventually have about equal market shares, Albaugh said.  “Comac is going to sell into their domestic market and
they’ll probably also sell some of their planes around the
world,” he said. “In the years to come, they’re going to be a
tough competitor.”  The C919 and  737 MAX  compete in the single-aisle segment
that dominates global airline fleets. The market will probably
account for 71 percent of the 5,000 new planes that Chinese
carriers will order through 2030, according to  forecasts  from
Chicago-based Boeing.  Comac’s plane is due to enter service in 2016, while Airbus
targets a late-2015 debut for the A320neo, the newest variant in
the Toulouse, France-based planemaker’s narrow-body family. The
C919’s only overseas buyer is  General Electric Co. (GE) ’s leasing arm,
which has signed up for as many as 10. GE is also supplying the
engines and forming an avionics venture with Comac’s parent.  Boeing rose 1.3 percent to $73.52 in New York trading
yesterday. It’s little changed this year, compared with a 7.6
percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  Wide-Body Orders  In the wide-body segment, Boeing anticipates “several
dozen” 777 orders in China this year, and deals for both 747-8
passenger and freighter jumbo jets, Albaugh said, without
elaboration. Hainan Airlines Co., backed by the government of
Hainan province, may swap 787 orders for 747-8s, Chen Feng, the
chairman of its parent, said last week.  Boeing will deliver the first 747-8 to be used for
commercial passenger flights to  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  this month,
Albaugh said. It has already handed over 747-8s for use as
freighters and private aircraft.  The planemaker has won orders for 106 747-8s, an updated
and more fuel-efficient version of the humpbacked 747-400,
according to its website. Global demand for such sized aircraft
may total as many as 1,000 over 20 years, Albaugh said.  787 Delivery  Boeing expects to deliver its first 787 Dreamliner in China
this year to  China Southern Airlines Co. (1055) , the nation’s biggest
carrier by passengers. The handover will probably take place
“later this summer,” Albaugh said. Boeing has 59 orders for
787s from Chinese airlines, according to its website.  China Eastern Airlines Corp., the country’s second-biggest
carrier by passengers, swapped 24 orders for 787s last year in
favor of smaller 737s because of delivery delays and a slowdown
in demand for long-haul international travel. Boeing doesn’t
expect many other Dreamliner cancellations, Albaugh said.  “We see very few people right now that are talking about
getting out of that airplane,” he said. “If they are, it’s
because of financial issues. It has nothing to do with the
performance.”  --Stephen Engle, Tian Ying and Jasmine Wang. Editors: Neil Denslow, Ed Dufner  To contact the reporters on this story:
