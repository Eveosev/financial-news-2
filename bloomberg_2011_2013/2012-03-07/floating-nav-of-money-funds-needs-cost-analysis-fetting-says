Eliminating the stable $1 share
price of money market mutual funds would require a cost benefit
analysis beforehand, said  Legg Mason Inc. (LM) ’s  Mark Fetting .  “Tweaking the product is a far better solution than
something extreme like that,” Fetting, chief executive officer
of the Baltimore-based money manager, said today at the 2012
Citigroup Financial Services Conference in New York.  Fetting said if “extreme conditions” were imposed on
money funds by regulators, Legg Mason may be forced to revisit
the business. Legg Mason had $631 billion in assets under
management as of Jan. 31, about 18 percent of which was in
liquidity funds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
