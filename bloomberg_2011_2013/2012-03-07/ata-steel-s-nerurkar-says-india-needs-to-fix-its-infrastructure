H.M. Nerurkar, managing director at
 Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , comments on his expectations from the
government’s budget for the year beginning April 1. Finance
Minister  Pranab Mukherjee  will announce the budget on March 16.
Nerurkar spoke in an interview in the eastern city of Jamshedpur
yesterday.  “As a steel company, we would expect that projects that
have been announced should actually be on the ground. That is
the only thing that will stimulate steel demand and growth in
the country.  ‘‘Investment in the infrastructure sector must go up
because our country is now getting choked in terms of roads and
railways. If India has to go somewhere near  China  in
consumption, or if steel consumption doubles in 10 years, how do
you transport raw material, finished goods, or reach the
customer? Infrastructure is still very poor, be it ports,
airports or roads. So that stimulus is a must if business has to
move fast.  ‘‘Something also needs to be done quickly for the  mining
industry  because last quarter mining actually contracted by 3
percent. This is quite bad. Mining also involves a lot of
infrastructure jobs, including mobile equipment and trucks.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
