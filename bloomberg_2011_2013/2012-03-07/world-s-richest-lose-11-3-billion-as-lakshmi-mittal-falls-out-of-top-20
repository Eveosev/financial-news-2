The 20 richest people on Earth lost
a combined $11.3 billion yesterday as global markets fell after
European economic growth slowed and investors weighed Greece’s
chances of getting bondholders to accept a debt swap.  Warren Buffett’s fortune fell $407.3 million, dropping his
net worth to $43.9 billion. The chairman of Omaha, Nebraska-
based  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B) , his investment holding company,
ranks third on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking
of the world’s richest people.  “Warren Buffett has no reason to worry and neither does
Carlos Slim,”  Jeffrey Saut , chief investment strategist at
Raymond James Financial Inc. in  St. Petersburg , Florida, said in
an interview. “It’s a buy. The world’s not going into
recession.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 index  posted its worst drop of
the year, sliding 1.5 percent as U.S. stocks declined for the
third straight day. Europe’s economy shrank 0.3 percent last
quarter, the European Union’s statistics office said, and the
central bank’s balance sheet surged to a record 3.02 trillion
euros ($3.96 trillion) last week amid crisis-fighting efforts.  Bernard Arnault and Amancio Ortega, two European retail
magnates on the billionaires list, both lost about $1.2 billion.
Arnault, 63, now ranks fifth on the index with a net worth of
$41.2 billion after shares of his  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis
Vuitton (MC)  SA, the world’s largest luxury goods company, dropped
3.1 percent in Paris trading. Ortega, 75, who owns a 59 percent
stake in fashion retailer  Inditex SA (ITX) , the world’s largest
clothing retailer, ranks seventh with a $37.7 billion fortune.
No billionaire on the index gained.  Ferrero Joins List  Lakshmi Mittal, chairman and chief executive officer of
 ArcelorMittal (MT) , the world’s largest steel company, fell from the
ranking after his fortune dropped $918 million, or 4 percent.
Shares of ArcelorMittal declined 5.5 percent in Amsterdam
trading. Mittal, 61, is now the 21st-richest person in the world
with a net worth of $22.3 billion.  Replacing him in the index is Italy’s Michele Ferrero,
whose $22.5 billion fortune makes him the world’s 18th-richest
person. Ferrero owns the world’s fourth-largest chocolate maker,
 Ferrero SpA (FERR) . The company’s products include Ferrero Rocher
hazelnut chocolates and Nutella. His net worth is up 6.6 percent
this year.  Sheldon Adelson, chairman and chief executive officer of
casino operator  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , saw his fortune decline
$765.5 million after a drop of $680 million on March 5. He’s now
the 14th-richest person on the index with a net worth of $24.3
billion.  Adelson, Batista  Adelson, 78, and his wife, Miriam, exercised a warrant to
buy 87.5 million common shares at $6 apiece, Las Vegas Sands
said in a regulatory filing on March 5.  Brazil’s Eike Batista, 55, whose commodity empire includes
a majority stake in oil company  OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas Participacoes
SA, saw his fortune decrease to $29.2 billion as the Bovespa
Index declined 2.8 percent, its biggest drop since October.  Brazil, Latin America’s largest economy, posted its second-
worst performance since 2003 last year as higher borrowing costs
and a currency that surged to a 12-year high led it to
underperform emerging-market peers China and India.  Larry Ellison , who owns about 22.5 percent of  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ,
the world’s largest maker of  database software , lost $385.7
million. The company’s shares declined about 1 percent, cutting
Ellison’s fortune to $37.9 billion and making the technology
mogul the world’s sixth-richest person, according to the index.
His net worth is up 15 percent this year, the index shows. He
trails only  Bill Gates  among tech billionaires.  To contact the reporter on this story:
