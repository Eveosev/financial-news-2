Georgia  said it may yet attract
South Korean bidders for its $800 million Namakhvan hydropower
project after potential investors pulled out earlier this year.  South Korean companies are still interested in taking part
in the project, which will help the former Soviet republic cut
dependence on fossil-fuel imports, Georgia’s Deputy Energy
Minister Mariam Valishvili said today in an interview.  A group led by  Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEP) , including SK
Engineering & Construction Co. and Turkey’s Nurol Construction &
Trading Co., had signed an initial agreement in 2009 to build a
hydropower plant in the mountainous Namakhvan area of western
Georgia. That plan ended up being scrapped due to the
“financial crisis and disagreements,” Valishvili said in an
interview in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi.  A shortlist of potential bidders for the 450-megawatt
plant, to be constructed on the Rioni River, will be ready in
April or May, according to Valishvili. Companies from  Italy ,
Russia,  China , Turkey and Norway have also expressed an
interest, she said, without elaborating.  Korea Electric and SK Engineering said today that no
investment plans had been finalized.  Georgia expects to invest as much $2.5 billion in
hydropower projects in the next few years, following 12 such
ventures planned for this year, President Mikheil Saakashvili
said in a speech to parliament last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
