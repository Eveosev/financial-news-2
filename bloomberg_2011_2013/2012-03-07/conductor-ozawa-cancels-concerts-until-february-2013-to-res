Japanese conductor Seiji Ozawa
canceled all scheduled performances until next February after
doctors advised him to rest following a bout of pneumonia.  The conductor needs extended rest and dietary treatment,
Masato Okada, a physician at St. Luke’s International Hospital
in  Tokyo , said in a statement on the website of the Saito Kinen
Festival Matsumoto. Ozawa is festival director of the annual
musical event, held in  Japan ’s Nagano prefecture.  Ozawa, 76, was diagnosed with esophageal cancer two years
ago and has suffered from pneumonia three times since. The
former music director of the Vienna State Opera has been
canceling concerts to undergo medical treatment after the
diagnosis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
