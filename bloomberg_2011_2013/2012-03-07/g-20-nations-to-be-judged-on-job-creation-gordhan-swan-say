The Group of 20 nations will be
judged on how it contributes to creating jobs during the
economic recovery, South African Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan 
and Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said.  Countries should focus on changing  labor laws , including
offering incentives to boost hiring, providing more training and
improving productivity, Gordhan and Swan wrote in an  opinion
article  published in the Johannesburg-based Business Day
newspaper today. It was from a paper submitted to the G-20
meeting in  Mexico  last month, Business day said.  “The success of the G-20 in the eyes of many will largely
be judged by the contribution it makes to creating jobs,”
Gordhan and Swan wrote. “Commitments to sustainable medium-term
fiscal policies and secure financial systems will provide the
platform for improved growth and employment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
