Seat Pagine Gialle SpA (PG) ,  Italy ’s
largest phone-book publisher, said its debt restructuring plan
won the backing of more than 97 percent of senior bondholders,
the last class of creditors required to approve the proposal.  Senior bondholders now have to “formally” give their
consent to the plan at a meeting convened for March 29 or 30,
the Turin, Italy-based company said in a statement today. The
plan has already been endorsed by more than the required
threshold of junior noteholders and senior lenders, it said.  Once creditors give consent, “it will be possible to
proceed with the implementation of the restructuring
transaction,” Seat Pagine said in the statement. The company
got “full support” for the debt proposal from controlling
investors CVC, Permira Advisers Ltd. and Investitori Associati
SpA last week.  Seat Pagine has been seeking backing from at least 75
percent of its creditors on a final proposal for the company’s
debt reorganization. The board is giving creditors until today
at 5 p.m. London time to accept the restructuring plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
