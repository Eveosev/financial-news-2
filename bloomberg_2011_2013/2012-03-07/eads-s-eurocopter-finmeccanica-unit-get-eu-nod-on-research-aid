Eurocopter, a unit of  European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) , and  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) ’s Agusta
Westland division won European Union approval for French and
Italian research aid to develop medium-weight civil helicopters.  The European Commission said it authorized France to
provide a 143 million-euro ($188.2 million) advance to
Eurocopter, which must be repaid when it hits a sales target. It
also approved an Italian government loan to Agusta Westland of
272 million euros at zero-interest over 19 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
