Vietnam ’s three-year bonds rose
after the central bank said it would cut  interest rates  due to
slowing inflation. The dong was steady.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam will reduce its refinancing and
repurchase rates by 1 percentage point in the “next few days,”
Governor Nguyen Van Binh said yesterday in Hanoi, following a
request from Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. The central bank
will also lower the maximum interest rate banks can pay for
deposits in dong, he said.  Consumer prices  rose 16.44 percent in
February from a year earlier after increasing 17.27 percent in
January, according to government data.  “Even though the rate cut was expected by many investors,
the news coming out yesterday still strongly supported the
fixed-income market as the central bank expressed its higher
confidence about the macroeconomic situation,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital
Securities.  The  yield  on three-year notes fell nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 11.43 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. The dong was steady at
20,830 per dollar as of 3:50 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
official rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
