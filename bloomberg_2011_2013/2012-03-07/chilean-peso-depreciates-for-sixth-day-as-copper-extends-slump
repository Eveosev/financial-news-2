Chile ’s peso extended its longest
losing streak since June 2010 as declining copper prices dimmed
trade prospects of the metal’s top-producing nation amid concern
that an economic slowdown in China will damp global demand.  The peso weakened 0.2 percent to 492.10 per  U.S. dollar  as
of 11:44 a.m. in Santiago from yesterday’s 491.25 closing price
at 1:30 p.m. The currency fell to as low as 494.05, the weakest
since January, in after hours trading yesterday, according to
data compiled by Datatec. The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American
Currency Index declined 0.2 percent.  Copper, Chile’s main export, fell as much as 0.6 percent in
 New York , heading for a fourth straight drop. The peso is on a
six-day losing streak after breaking through key technical
levels yesterday when  China , the biggest buyer of Chilean
copper, lowered its annual growth target.  “Yesterday’s adjustment to China’s growth outlook resulted
in a massive correction,” said Alejandro Araya, a currency
trader at Banco Santander Chile in Santiago. “The market’s
taking a break after a big movement yesterday but it’s moving
more towards 500 per dollar than 490 per dollar.”  The deadline for a Greek debt swap that would help the
country avoid a disorderly default runs out tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
