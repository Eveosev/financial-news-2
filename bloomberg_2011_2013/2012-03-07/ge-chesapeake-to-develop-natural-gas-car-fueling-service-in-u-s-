General Electric Co. (GE)  and  Chesapeake
Energy Corp. (CHK) , the second-biggest U.S. natural-gas producer, will
collaborate on products and services to fuel cars and trucks
with domestically-produced natural gas.  The companies intend to have a multi-year collaboration
that will improve access to compressed natural gas, which is
most commonly used in taxicabs, transit buses and cars and
liquefied natural gas, which is commonly used for heavy-duty
industrial purposes, according to a statement today.  The infrastructure will allow the U.S. to better utilize
natural gas being produced from shale formations, the companies
said.  “Dependence on foreign energy sources can be reduced while
simultaneously lowering fueling costs and vehicle emissions,”
according to the statement.  As an early step, GE, based in Fairfield,  Connecticut , will
provide more than 250 modular compression stations in this
year’s second half, the companies said today in a statement.  Natural gas can reduce fuel costs as much as 40 percent,
based on gasoline at $3.50 a gallon and compressed natural gas
selling for the equivalent of $2.09 a gallon, according to the
statement.  Chesapeake, based in  Oklahoma City , is the second-largest
U.S. gas producer behind Exxon Mobil Corp., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
