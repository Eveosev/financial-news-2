Bank of Montreal  will offer a new
10-year fixed-rate mortgage for 3.99 percent starting March 11.
Canada’s fourth-biggest bank said it will also lower one of its
five-year fixed-rate mortgages by 50 basis points to 2.99
percent as of tomorrow.  The  mortgage rates , which carry a 25-year amortization
period, will be available until March 28, Frank Techar, head of
Canadian banking, said today in a telephone interview. The
Toronto-based lender prompted mortgage cuts among rivals when it
offered the same rate in January for its five-year mortgage.  “The reaction to our January offer was fantastic,” Techar
said. “We think it woke Canadians up to the fact that there are
some significant benefits to a 25-year amortization mortgage.”  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  previously only had 10-year mortgages with
a 30-year amortization period, which carried a rate of 6.29
percent. The lower rates of these mortgages aims to draw
attention to 25-year amortizations as an alternative to longer
amortization periods, the bank said.  “We think this product continues to be attractive to our
customers and consistent with our objectives in  Canada  to ensure
that we’ve got a stable housing market,” Techar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
