Alberta Premier Alison Redford said
she’s optimistic  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Keystone XL project will
get a U.S. approval if all the arguments about the environment,
economy and  energy security  are taken into consideration.  Redford, speaking at a conference organized by the United
States Energy Association, said she has “no reason to believe”
that the regulatory process U.S. has in place to deal with
Keystone XL, a project of an Alberta-based company, isn’t
appropriate or fair.   To contact the reporter on this story:
