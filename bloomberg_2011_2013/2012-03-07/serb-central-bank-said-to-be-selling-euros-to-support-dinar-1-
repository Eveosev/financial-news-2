The Serbian central bank sold euros
to curb todayâ€™s declines in the dinar after it fell to as low as
111.2300 to the the common currency this morning in Belgrade,
three traders said.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 30 million
euros ($39.33 million) to banks, lifting the dinar to 110.7622
to the euro, it said in a statement posted on its website.  The central bank has now spent 238.5 million euros since
the start of 2012 to curb the weakening dinar, which some
analysts see it declining by 10 percent this year as capital
inflows dry.  The National Bank of  Serbia  will decide tomorrow on policy
direction and the level of its benchmark  interest rate , last
lowered in January by a quarter of a percentage point to 9.50
percent.  Eleven of 23 economists in a Bloomberg  survey  see no rate
change, six predict a quarter-point and two saw a half-point
decrease. Four respondents expect an increase by 50 basis
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
