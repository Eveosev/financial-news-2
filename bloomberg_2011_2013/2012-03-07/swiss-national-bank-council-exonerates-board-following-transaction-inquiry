The  Swiss National Bank (SNBN) ’s
supervisory board said a KPMG probe into transactions showed all
board members and their deputies acted in line with internal
rules in the three years through 2011.  “No activities were identified which might suggest that
financial transactions by members of the enlarged governing
board were in breach of guidelines,” the board said in an e-
mailed statement today. While interim Chairman Thomas Jordan and
deputies Thomas Moser and Dewet Moser were fully cleared, KPMG
conducted a “detailed analysis” into two transactions by board
member Jean-Pierre Danthine and deputy Thomas Wiedmer. The Bank
Council said both “cannot be reproached for any misconduct”
and didn’t “take advantage of privileged” information.  Today’s outcome paves the way for Jordan to take the helm
at the SNB after Philipp Hildebrand quit as chairman on Jan. 9
over currency purchases by his wife. The 49-year old economist
has already signaled he’s willing to accept the post and Bank
Council President Hansueli Raggenbass said the “conditions are
in place” for the government to take a decision.  “Theoretically, it would be of advantage to elect a new
SNB president soon,” Raggenbass said a briefing in Zurich
today. It would “create more stability at the SNB.”  The franc strengthened after the report, trading as high
1.2048 versus the euro. It was at 1.2052 at 4:53 p.m. in Zurich.
Against the dollar, it traded at 91.91 centimes.  KPMG Probe  The Bank Council in January ordered the  KPMG investigation 
into all transactions. While Hildebrand, 48, had initially been
cleared of any wrongdoing, the furor over his wife’s purchase of
$504,000 in August -- considered “sensitive” in the probe --
prompted the SNB to publish more details and forced him to step
down, just three weeks after the results were published.  KPMG  investigated all transactions of the enlarged board
and their families, with the exception of Hildebrand’s wife
Kashya. While Hildebrand had been forced to disclose details of
private transactions in January, the SNB said today the latest
six individual reports “contain material protected by rights of
privacy and therefore cannot be made public.”  Danthine, Wiedmer  Danthine, Wiedmer and Hildebrand each had two transactions
reviewed in more detail. Hildebrand sold 700,000 euros
($917,350) and purchased 1.07 million francs ($1.16 million) on
March 17, 2009, followed by a sale of 156,465 euros on June 18
of the same year. Both transactions were carried out at a time
when the SNB was trying to stem franc gains through purchases of
foreign currencies.  “KPMG has found no indication with regard to these
transactions which would suggest that there was any conflict of
interest, or that confidential information was exploited to
derive a personal advantage,” the statement said.  Danthine, who joined the SNB in 2010, on February of the
same year sold 197,674 euros and purchased 289,000 francs to pay
into the central bank’s pension fund. He also bought 178,794
francs for 126,000 euros on May 20, 2010 after his  investment
adviser  suggested that he reduce his euro holdings.  The SNB in mid-June 2010 ended 15 months of efforts to
weaken the franc through purchases of foreign currencies. On
Sept. 6, 2011, it introduced a currency cap after the franc
surged to near-parity against the euro.  Tougher Rules  Wiedmer on March 8 purchased shares for 4,162.95 francs,
which he sold on April 6 of the same year for 3,772.30 francs,
violating the central bank’s six-month holding period for so-
called passive management. On Sept. 9, 2011, he purchased shares
for 1,769.45 francs, which he sold on Nov. 11 for 644.50 francs.
Wiedmer “was of the opinion that the minimum holding period did
not apply to loss minimization,” the SNB said.  “The Bank Council has taken note of the results of the
investigation and has looked into them in detail,” it said.
“It continues to have full confidence in Danthine and Wiedmer,
as well as the other members of the enlarged governing board.”  The central bank, which proposed to toughen internal rules
after Hildebrand quit, said today that “work is almost complete
and the new regulations will be published shortly.” It also
said that the Bank Council will present a proposal for the
appointment of a new board member to the government “within the
next few weeks.”  The turmoil at the helm of the SNB comes amid the central
bank’s efforts to defend its franc ceiling of 1.20 versus the
euro to protect the economy. Jordan on Feb. 28 said that the SNB
had been able “to correct the franc’s overvaluation” and that
it “will continue to do that with all determination.”  The SNB bank will present its 2011 earnings tomorrow and
hold its next monetary policy assessment on March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
