An Egyptian military court sentenced
two people to death and three to life in prison for killing an
armed forces officer during last year’s uprising aginst  Hosni Mubarak , the state-run Middle East  News Agency  reported.  The court sentenced two others to 15 years in prison and
eight people to 10 years, while nine were acquitted, the Cairo-
based news agency reported today.  The defendants were accused of involvement in torturing the
officer, beheading him and hanging his head outside a police
station that they later set ablaze, MENA said. It described them
as “criminals” who deal in drugs. The incident started when
the officer confronted one of them, it said without providing
