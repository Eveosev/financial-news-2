Turkey ’s advertising market may grow
15 percent this year, at a slower pace than the previous two
years’ growth,  Turkish Association of Advertising Agencies  said.  Spending for advertisement by companies in Turkey grew 20
percent to 4.32 billion liras ($2.4 billion) in 2011 after
growing 31 percent in 2010, the group said in an e-mailed
statement today.  About 57 percent of the 2011 advertising spending was for
television commercials, 24 percent for print media, 8 percent
for Internet and 7 percent for billboards and other open-air
outlets, the Istanbul-based group said. Radio advertisements
made up 2.8 percent of the total, it said.  The growth last year came mainly from advertisers of food,
cosmetics and personal care products, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
