The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in

Colcap Index rose 0.1 percent to 1,708.86.  Bancolombia SA (BCOLO)  ,  Colombia ’s biggest lender, rose
1.8 percent, the most intraday in a month, to 27,520 pesos. The
company is considering refinancing its debt, including through
an exchange, after selling a record $2.7 billion of bonds last
year, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Raul Yepes said in an
interview yesterday.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s largest oil company,
fell for a second day, losing 0.4 percent to 5,160 pesos.  Sandra Morelli, Colombia’s comptroller, said an explosion
of a pipeline that killed 32 was not caused by rains and can be
attributed to a lack of maintenance, the Bogota-based daily El
Tiempo reported March 5. Ecopetrol said the pipeline rupture in
December was triggered by rainfall that led soil around the
infrastructure to give way, according to a March 5 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
