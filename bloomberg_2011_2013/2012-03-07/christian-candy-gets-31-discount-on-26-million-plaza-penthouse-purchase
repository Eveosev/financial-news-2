Christian Candy, the U.K. property
developer whose company helped build  London ’s One Hyde Park
complex, bought a penthouse apartment at Manhattan’s Plaza hotel
at a 31 percent discount from what its owners initially sought.  Candy acquired a 6,500-square-foot (604-square-meter)
triplex, known as Penthouse 2009, for $25.9 million, according
to property records made public today at the New York City
Department of Finance. The apartment was sold by New York-based
developer El-Ad Properties, according to a statement yesterday
from Candy & Candy, the interior-design company owned by
Christian and his brother, Nick.  Candy’s apartment, which overlooks Central Park, was first
listed for sale in April for $37.5 million, according to
 StreetEasy , a Manhattan real estate listings website. In
October, the seller reduced the price by 11 percent to $33.5
million.  Purchases of  Manhattan  luxury apartments, defined as the
top 10 percent of all sales by price, declined 13 percent in the
fourth quarter to 201 deals, according to a Jan. 4 report by New
York appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and broker Prudential Douglas
Elliman Real Estate. The median price of those deals dropped 4.6
percent to $4.15 million.  The four-bedroom, five-bathroom triplex is part of a once-
larger apartment that was under contract for $45 million in
2006. The would-be buyer, Russian financier Andrei Vavilov,
walked away from the deal, forfeiting his deposit in exchange
for a smaller unit in the building.  One Hyde Park, in London’s Knightsbridge neighborhood, was
developed by a venture between  Christian Candy ’s CPC Group and
Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad Bin Jasim Bin Jaber al Thani’s
closely held Waterknights. Candy conceived the 86-apartment
complex with his brother.  To contact the reporter on this story:
