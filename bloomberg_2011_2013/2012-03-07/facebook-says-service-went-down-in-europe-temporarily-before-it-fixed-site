Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
most popular social-networking site, said its service was
unavailable to some users in  Europe  for a short period today
before the company was able to resolve the glitch.  The service suffered “technical difficulties,” Facebook
said in an e-mailed statement today. The matter was widespread
enough to become one of the most-discussed topics on social
media service  Twitter Inc.  in France and Germany today.  “Everyone should now have access to Facebook,”  Menlo
Park , California-based Facebook said. “We apologize for any
inconvenience.”  Facebook, with more than 845 million members, is relying on
Europe and other areas outside of the U.S. to boost user and
revenue growth as it prepares for an initial public offering.
While the U.S. still makes up 56 percent of sales, the
“majority” of revenue from elsewhere is from Western Europe,
Canada and Australia, according to a regulatory  filing .  Facebook, led by co-founder  Mark Zuckerberg , filed for the
IPO last month, pursuing what may be the largest Internet
offering on record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
