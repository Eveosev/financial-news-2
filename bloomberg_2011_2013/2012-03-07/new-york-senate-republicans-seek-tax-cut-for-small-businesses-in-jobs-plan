New York (STONY1)  Republicans, who control
the Senate, will include in their budget proposal a 20 percent
tax cut for small businesses as part of a plan to create jobs.  The Senate is set to vote on its budget proposal next week,
 Dean Skelos , the majority leader, said in a statement today.
Under the plan, the corporate  tax rate  for small businesses
would be cut to 5.5 percent from 6.85 percent, a $65 million
reduction for almost 200,000 entities, according to the
statement, which didn’t specify the size of businesses that
would be affected.  In December, lawmakers approved a bill backed by Governor
 Andrew Cuomo , a Democrat, that cut income-tax rates for the
middle class and raised them for joint filers earning $2 million
or more. Employers in the 12 counties surrounding  New
York City  saw a reduction in the portion of their payroll taxes
used to support the  Metropolitan Transportation Authority .  “Last year, Senate Republicans partnered with Governor
Cuomo to begin revitalizing the state’s economy by reducing
spending and cutting taxes for businesses and middle-class  New
Yorkers ,” Skelos said. The new plan will “build on that
progress by cutting taxes even more, ensuring fiscal
responsibility, protecting taxpayers and helping businesses
create more jobs.”  Minimum Wage  Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, has proposed a
bill that would raise the  minimum wage  to $8.50 an hour from
$7.25 and tie future increases to the inflation rate. Senate
Republicans have said the measure would harm small businesses
and lead to job cuts.  The Republican plan announced today would also give a 10
percent tax credit to about 800,000 businesses that have less
than $250,000 in business income, at least one employee and file
under the personal income tax. The credit would save businesses
$120 million, it said.  Another piece of the plan would give businesses a tax
credit of as much as $5,000 for each new job they create, up to
$8,000 if the job goes to someone collecting  unemployment
insurance , or as much as $10,000 if the business hires a
returning veteran.  Cuomo has included his own jobs plan in his $132.5 billion
budget centered on a $15 billion infrastructure fund that would
speed up repairs on 2,000 miles (3,218 kilometers) of roads, 90
municipal water systems and 100 bridges. If approved on time,
the budget would go into effect April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story: Freeman Klopott in
