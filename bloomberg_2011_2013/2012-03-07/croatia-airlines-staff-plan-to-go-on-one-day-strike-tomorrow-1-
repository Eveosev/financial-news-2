Workers at  Croatia Airlines (CRALRA) , the
Adriatic nation’s state-owned air carrier, will hold a 24-hour
strike tomorrow after failing to agree on a new labor contract.  The strike is scheduled to start at 6 a.m. in Zagreb
tomorrow, spokesman Davor Janusic said by phone today. Four
unions representing the company’s employees called for a strike
after the management and employees failed to agree on a new
collective contract, the flag-carrier said in an e-mailed
statement.  The strike will affect about 30 domestic and international
flights and cost the money-losing carrier more than 200,000
euros ($262,000), the company said. The workers are negotiating
for higher pay and social benefits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
