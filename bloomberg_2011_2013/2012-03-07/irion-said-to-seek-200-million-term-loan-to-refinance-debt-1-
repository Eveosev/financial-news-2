Mirion Technologies Inc. (MION) , a provider
of radiation detection products, is seeking a $200 million  term
loan  to refinance debt, according to a person with knowledge of
the transaction.  The debt, due in six years, will pay 5 percentage points
more than the London interbank offered rate, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.
Libor, the rate banks say they can borrow in dollars from each
other, will have a 1.25 percent floor.  Mirion is proposing to sell the loan at 98 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  Lenders are being offered one-year soft-call protection of
101 cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more
than face value to refinance the debt during the first year, the
person said.  Credit Suisse Group AG is arranging the financing and will
host a lender meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m. in  New York , the
person said. The  San Ramon , California-based company is also
seeking a $25 million revolving line of credit.  In January 2006  American Capital Ltd. (ACAS)  formed Mirion through
a merger of its U.S. portfolio companies Global Dosimetry
Solution Inc. and Imaging and Sensing Technology Corp. with its
French portfolio company synOdys Group SA, according to  American
Capital’s website .  Kimberly Croxson, a spokeswoman for Mirion, didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
