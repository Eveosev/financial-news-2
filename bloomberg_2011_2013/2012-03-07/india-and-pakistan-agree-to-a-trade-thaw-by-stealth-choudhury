Perhaps more than 90 percent of news items that bring together  India  and Pakistan, the subcontinent's two great powers, report something negative: tensions along the border, bickering over the disputed state of Kashmir, concerns about terrorism, or, at its most benign, a storm of jingoistic sentiment and flag-waving on both sides on the eve of an important cricket match (as when the two countries met in the semifinal of the cricket  World Cup  last year). So it came as a surprise last week when Pakistan's announcement of a "negative list" of items that couldn't be traded with India was warmly welcomed by the governments of both countries as a positive development. Margherita Stancati and  Tom Wright   reported in the Wall Street Journal : Must news of an opening up of trade relations between neighbors that have gone to war on each other thrice in six decades be phrased by governments in such a contorted way? Apparently it must, or no one will take it seriously. The technicalities of this statement, and its implications for bilateral trade, were  explained in The Times of India : As the article notes, trade between the two countries, with a combined population that is one-fourth of that of the world, stands currently at a pitiful $2.7 billion. As a  World Bank study  in 2007 on the prospects of bilateral trade as a growth driver for both countries noted, current volumes of India-Pakistan trade amount to "only 9 percent of the trade that occurs between Argentina and  Brazil , two countries of comparable size and proximity." As things stand, the balance of what little trade that exists is heavily weighted in India's favor. The decision, therefore, has much more significance, both as an opportunity and a challenge, for the struggling Pakistani economy, and many Pakistani newspapers  voiced fears  that local industry would be jolted by a flood of cheap Indian imports. But the larger context of the news wasn't so much economic as political. The more that two neighboring countries trade with each other, the harder it is for them to go to war. In the case of India and Pakistan, the walls against trade erected by both governments are even more tragic given the subcontinent's long history as an integrated market and as the site of one of the world's most ancient and storied trade routes: the  Silk Road , encompassing present-day India, Pakistan, and  Afghanistan . People in both countries carry family histories, and, inevitably, memories of trade, rooted in a world that now lies across the border (the prime minister of India,  Manmohan Singh , was born in 1932 in a part of west Punjab that now lies in Pakistan;  Pervez Musharraf , the former president of Pakistan, was born in  New Delhi ). These memories continue to circulate, as I found out last week when I said to the fruit vendor on my street in Delhi that his pomegranates weren't very good and he replied, "You should have been around in the old days, when pomegranates used to come in  from Pakistan . Oh, they tasted like honey!" The same  World Bank study  noted that  South Asia 's intra-regional trade was the lowest in the world, lower even than local trade in sub-Saharan  Africa . It explained how trade between India and Pakistan had been in a state of regress over six decades: This may now change, perhaps to the extent that there occurs -- to use the jargon of international relations -- a long-awaited paradigm shift in the relations between the two countries. The most ringing endorsement of the work done by the two governments was supplied by the political analyst C. Raja Mohan in  The Indian Express : And in a piece entitled " Economics scores over mindless patriotism " in The Economic Times, Amiti Sen wrote: Of course, there is still plenty of wariness on both sides because of the continuous history of troubled relations between the two countries over core issues of foreign policy. The Indian Express warned that "it must be remembered that subcontinental foreign policy — especially in Pakistan, and with regard to India — is prone to sudden domestic reversals which can unravel deals already secured." Even so, my fruit-loving self hopes to see a day not very far in the future when I can buy Pakistani pomegranates in a Delhi winter, and then voyage to Lahore or Karachi in the summer (the Pakistani government having generously liberalized the current forbidding visa regime, and my friends among Pakistani novelists -- such as the dashing  HM Naqvi , who owns as many fur-lined jackets as Imelda Marcos had pairs of shoes -- having invited me over) to find in the markets there the splendid benishan mangoes of south India.
