Phillips 66, the refining business
that’s being spun off by  ConocoPhillips (COP) , led energy companies
selling $7.7 billion of bonds today.  The company issued $5.8 billion of three-, five-, 10- and
30-year notes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Kinder
Morgan Energy Partners LP, the Houston-based pipeline company,
 CMS Energy Corp. (CMS)  and Concho Resources also sold bonds.  ConocoPhillips is in the midst of a three-year plan to  sell 
$15 billion to $20 billion of assets by the end of 2012, which
has helped its stock return 65 percent in the past two years.
The Houston-based  oil company  plans to complete the Phillips 66
spinoff in the second quarter, possibly as soon as May, Chief
Financial Officer Jeff Sheets said on a January conference call.  “Phillips 66 is well-positioned as a leading independent
refining and marketing company, despite a challenging industry
environment,” Thomas Coleman, an analyst at Moody’s Investors
Service, said today in a statement.  Phillips 66 sold $800 million of three-year, 1.95 percent
notes that priced to yield 155 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, $1.5 billion of five-year, 2.95 percent
debt at a spread of 210 basis points, $2 billion of 10-year, 4.3
percent bonds at 235 basis points and $1.5 billion of 30-year,
5.875 percent securities at 275.  Term Loan  The new company will also arrange a $2.8 billion term loan,
according to Moody’s, which rates the notes three levels above
junk at Baa1. High-yield, or junk-rated, bonds are graded below
Baa3 by Moody’s and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  Kinder Morgan (KMP)  sold $1 billion of 3.95 percent debt due in
September 2022 that priced to yield 200 basis points more than
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. CMS Energy, an electricity and
natural-gas provider operating primarily in Michigan, sold $300
million of 10-year, 5.05 percent notes at a spread of 312.5
basis points.  Concho Resources, an oil company in Midland, Texas, issued
$600 million of 10.5-year notes that priced to yield 5.5
percent.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) , based in  Palo Alto ,  California , also
issued bonds, raising $2 billion. The company sold $1.5 billion
of 5.5-year, 2.6 percent notes that priced at a 175-point spread
and $500 million of 10.5-year, 4.05 percent debt at 210 basis
points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
