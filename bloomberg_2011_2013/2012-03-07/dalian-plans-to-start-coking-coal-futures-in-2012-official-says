China  is planning to start a coking
coal futures contract in the first half, Liu Xingqiang, general
manager at the Dalian Commodity Exchange, told reporters.  The bourse is “steadily proceeding with the launch” and
has been getting approval from regulators, Liu said today in
Beijing where he’s attending the National People’s Congress.  Domestic prices of coking coal have more than doubled in
the past six years as demand increased in the world’s fastest-
growing major economy. The bourse is researching  iron ore 
futures, he said. Iron ore and coking coal are used in
steelmaking. Coking coal is more valuable than the grade used
for electricity generation.  The exchange is aiming to introduce egg futures this year
as the widely used item “can help the public increase its
awareness of the commodities market”, Liu said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
