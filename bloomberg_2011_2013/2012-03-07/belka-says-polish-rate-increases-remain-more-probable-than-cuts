Poland ’s central bank is more likely
to raise interest rates than cut them as inflation stays above
the bank’s 2.5 percent target, Governor  Marek Belka  said at a
news briefing in Warsaw today.  The  Narodowy Bank Polski  increased its inflation forecast
for this year to between 3.6 percent and 4.5 percent and cut its
growth forecast to between 2.2 percent and 3.8 percent today,
while the rate-setting Monetary Policy Council left the
benchmark rate unchanged at 4.5 percent for a ninth month.  Following are excerpts from Belka’s comments to reporters.  On whether he still believes interest-rate increases are more
probable than cuts:  “I’m sticking to that.”  On inflation:  “We’re not satisfied with the fact that inflation isn’t
getting worse; it needs to get better.”  On the currency:  “There have been dramatic developments on the foreign-
exchange market. The zloty weakened significantly in the fourth
quarter, and in the first months of this year we’ve seen a
significant strengthening.  “The zloty is closer to its fundamental value than it was
before.”  On economic growth:  “Our forecasts show that inflation is slowing gradually.
But the latest economic data surprised us.  “If we had had January data when we prepared our
projection, the path would have been the same, but we would have
seen the inflation rate falling considerably more quickly.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
