Hungarians are split as to whether
President Pal Schmitt should resign from his post as a
university panel investigates his doctoral thesis after media
reports said it was plagiarized, pollster Median said.  Forty-one percent of respondents said Schmitt should quit,
while 38 percent said he shouldn’t, Median said on its  website .
Twenty-one percent didn’t respond or didn’t know.  The poll of 1,200 people was conducted Jan. 20-Jan. 24 in
person, Median said. The margin of error ranged from 2 percent
to 5 percent, depending on the number of responses to a given
question, the pollster said.  Schmitt denies the plagiarism claim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
