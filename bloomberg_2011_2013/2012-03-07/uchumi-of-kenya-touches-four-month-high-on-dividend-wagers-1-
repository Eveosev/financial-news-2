Uchumi Supermarkets Ltd. (UCSP) ,  Kenya ’s
only publicly traded retail chain, touched a four-month high as
investors bet the company will pay a dividend.  The stock gained as much as 3.7 percent to 8.5 shillings,
its strongest level since Nov. 16, before closing unchanged at
8.2 shillings at 3 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  “There was some news in the market that they are headed
for their first dividend in several years,” George Bodo, an
equity analyst at Nairobi-based Apex Africa Capital Ltd. said in
a phone interview today. “It drove some foreign investor
activity on that stock.”  Uchumi’s board will “deliberate on dividend payment by the
end of the current financial year,” Kestrel Capital ( East
Africa ) Ltd. analysts wrote March 5 in an e-mailed note. Kestrel
initiated coverage on Uchumi with a “buy” rating and a price
estimate of 15 shillings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
