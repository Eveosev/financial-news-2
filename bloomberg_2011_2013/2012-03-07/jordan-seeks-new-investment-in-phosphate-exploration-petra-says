Jordan  will allow new investments in
phosphate exploration, Prime Minister Awn Khasawneh said,
according to the state-run Petra news agency.  Steps have been taken to permit such investments, in line
with conditions and prices satisfactory to the government, he
said today in the Lower House of parliament, according to Petra.  The  Jordan Phosphate Mines Co. (JOPH) , the only company working in
exploring and extracting phosphate in Jordan, says it has
exploration and mining licenses covering a total area of more
than 300 square kilometers in three areas in the country.  In 2006, the Jordanian government signed a deal with Brunei
Investment Agency, represented by Kamil Holdings, granting
exclusive rights to explore and extract phosphate across Jordan,
the Jordan Times reported on Dec. 30, citing the Natural
Resources Authority. Under the agreement, any offers for new
investments in phosphate mining must be approved by Kamil, owner
of 37 percent of the phosphate company, which has the first
right of refusal, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
