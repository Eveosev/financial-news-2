Dubai’s stocks retreated the most in
more than two years, the worst-performing equity market in the
world today, ahead of  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC)  financial results and
on concern over the success of  Greece ’s debt swap.  Arabtec, the biggest United Arab Emirates construction
company that’s estimated to report a 57 percent drop in 2011
profit, slumped 9.9 percent.  Dubai Financial Market PJSC (DFM)  fell
the most in more than seven weeks. The  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  slid
4.8 percent, the most since January 2010 and was the biggest
daily decliner among 93 global indexes tracked by Bloomberg, to
1,607.77 at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. Abu Dhabi stocks
decreased 2.2 percent, the most since Aug. 7.  “Both U.S. and European equity markets came under pressure
yesterday,” hurting sentiment locally, said Sherif El Zeneiny,
head of equity trading at  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC . “The
U.A.E. markets witnessed a selloff today, as many investors were
taking money off the table. We might see some selling pressure
in the short term, but would expect the markets to stabilize
shortly after that and continue its upward trend.”  In  Europe , the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  rose 0.5 percent
after tumbling 2.7 percent yesterday amid concern that Greece
may not get adequate participation in a debt swap. The  Standard
and Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index dropped 1.5 percent yesterday, while  MSCI
AC Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  lost as much as 1 percent today.  Arabtec Meets  Dubai’s stocks have advanced 19 percent  this year  after
companies reported improved earnings and dividends. That
compares with a 7.4 percent increase in the  Bloomberg GCC 200
Index. (BGCC200)  Arabtec shares dropped the most since December 2009,
slumping to 2.93 dirhams. The company, whose board is meeting
today, may post a  drop  in full-year profit to 133 million
dirhams ($36 million), according to the average estimate of 12
analysts on Bloomberg.  Aabar Investments PJSC (AABAR) , the Abu Dhabi government company
which owns stakes in  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , increased its
ownership in Arabtec to 5.28 percent. That disappointed some
investors who had bet on Arabtec winning contracts amid regional
infrastructure spending. The shares are trading at 30  times
estimated earnings  compared with 10.3 times for Dubai’s
benchmark.  Dubai Financial Market, the only publicly traded Gulf Arab
stock market, tumbled 9.5 percent, the most since Jan. 16, to
1.05 dirhams.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  fell 0.7 percent, its fourth day of
declines. The  Kuwaiti (KWSEIDX)  gauge and Oman’s  MSM 30 Index (MSM30)  slipped 0.7
percent, while Bahrain’s  BB All Share Index (BHSEASI)  rose 0.1 percent.
 Saudi Arabia ’s  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  declined 0.3 percent,
snapping a 14-day rally, and trimming this week’s gain to 1.4
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
