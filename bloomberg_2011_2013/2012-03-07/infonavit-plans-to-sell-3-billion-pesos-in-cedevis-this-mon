Infonavit,  Mexico ’s largest
originator of mortgages, plans to issue about 3 billion pesos
($231 million) of securities known as Cedevis this month,
according to the state agency.  The Mexican lender plans to sell the inflation-linked,
mortgage-backed securities around March 21, Jorge Marquez,
senior manager of the Cedevis program, said today in a telephone
interview. The Mexican units of Citigroup Inc. and Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA will underwrite the sale, he said.  The securities will be backed by so-called Infonavit Total
loans which are typically larger and given to higher-income
clients, Marquez said. Infonavit is authorized to sell 10
billion pesos of Cedevis this year and may sell the rest of the
securities in May, he said.  “There’s a scarcity value because we’re not going to issue
as much as we did last year,” he said. Marquez said he met with
potential investors in Mexico City today.  Infonavit last month sold about 5 billion pesos in
securities backed by standard loans, given to lower income
borrowers, according to Marquez. The agency sold 13.5 billion
pesos in Cedevis last year and has about 70 billion pesos in the
securities outstanding, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
