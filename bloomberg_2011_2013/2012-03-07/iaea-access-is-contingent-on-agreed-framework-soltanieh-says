Iran  will permit  International
Atomic Energy Agency  inspectors to visit its Parchin military
complex only after both sides agree about what would be covered
during the assessment, Iran’s IAEA ambassador said.  Iran and the IAEA will have to reach an agreement on a
“required framework and actions” before the visit is allowed,
Ali Asghar Soltanieh told state-run Al Alam television today.  “Gaining access to military bases requires a predetermined
framework as visiting these bases is a very dangerous issue,”
Soltanieh said, according to the report published on the Iranian
news station’s website. “Iran’s talks with the IAEA are still
in progress, but we haven’t reached an agreement yet about the
framework of their visit to this site.”  IAEA officials were denied access to the Parchin base last
month, raising concern the country is working on the development
of a nuclear weapon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
