Talaat Moustafa Group Holding (TMGH)  headed
for the biggest daily loss in more than two weeks after full-
year profit of  Egypt ’s biggest publicly traded real-estate
developer dropped more than a third.  Shares of the Cairo-based company declined 2.6 percent to
4.93 Egyptian pounds at 10:45 a.m. in Cairo, heading for the
biggest daily retreat since Feb. 21. That pared the stock’s gain
this year to 67 percent. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  increased
0.2 percent today.  Net income  for the year that ended Dec. 31 fell to 577.5
million pounds ($96 million) from 940 million pounds a year
earlier, the company said in a statement to the Egyptian bourse
today. Revenue declined 3.8 percent to 5.1 billion pounds,
Talaat Moustafa said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
