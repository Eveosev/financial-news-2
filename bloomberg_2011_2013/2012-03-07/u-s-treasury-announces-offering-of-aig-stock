The U.S. Treasury Department said it
has launched an offering of $6 billion of its  American
International Group Inc. (AIG)  common stock. AIG has indicated that it
intends to purchase up to $3 billion of the common stock sold by
the Treasury in this offering at the initial public offering
price, the Treasury said in a statement today.  Treasury also said it reached an agreement with AIG that
provides for repayment of the governmentâ€™s remaining $8.5
billion preferred equity investment in the AIG-owned entity AIA
Aurora LLC -- a special-purpose vehicle that holds ordinary
shares in AIA Group Limited. AIG is expected to repay this
remaining $8.5 billion plus accrued preferred return, the
Treasury said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
