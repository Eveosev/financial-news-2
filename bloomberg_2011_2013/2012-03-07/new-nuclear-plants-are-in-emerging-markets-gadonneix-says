More than 60 nuclear projects are
being planned in the world today and most of the new nuclear
plants are being built in emerging markets, according to  Pierre Gadonneix , chairman of the World Energy Council and former chief
executive officer of EDF SA.  “The rebound since 2004 is continuing, perhaps at a slower
pace,” Gadonneix said on BFM radio before a report to be
published tomorrow.  The report shows that 30 countries have nuclear plants, and
the U.S., France and  Japan  represent half of the world’s nuclear
energy, he said in the interview. Four countries -- Germany,
Japan,  Switzerland  and Italy -- have slowed or stopped their
nuclear programs, said Gadonneix, who wants the creation of
global industry norms.  “We need a structure a bit like the Group of 20,” he told
BFM. “We have to create a group of experts to help governance
evolve.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
