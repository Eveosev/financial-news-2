Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , the Ontario-
based solar-panel maker, fell the most in almost five months
after reporting a fourth-quarter loss that exceeded analysts’
estimates.  Canadian Solar, which is based in Kitchener and makes
panels in China, fell 13 percent to $2.85 at the close in New
York, the most since Oct. 17. The shares have gained 7.1 percent
this year.  The company’s net loss was $59.9 million, or $1.39 a share,
compared with net income of $25.5 million, or 58 cents, a year
earlier, it said today in a statement. Analysts had expected a
loss of 22 cents, the average of six estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Shipments for the year rose 65 percent to 1.3 gigawatts
from 2010.  Canadian Solar forecast shipments of 1.8 gigawatts to 2
gigawatts of panels this year as it diversifies its sales.
 Europe  accounted for 47 percent of fourth-quarter sales, from 71
percent a year earlier. Germany, the world’s biggest solar
market, is lowering its subsidies for solar energy to slow
growth in installations.  Chinese competitors  JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS)  and  Suntech
Power Holdings Co. (STP) , which fell as much as 4.3 percent and 3.9
percent today respectively, will report earnings tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
