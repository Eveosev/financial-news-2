Mervyn Davies , vice chairman of
Corsair Capital LLC and former chief executive officer of
Standard Chartered Plc, comments on bankers’ pay. He spoke in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in Hong Kong today.  “I think the crisis has highlighted the industry was a
sick industry, was paying too much and it was out of touch with
society, so the reality is that pay levels would have to come
down.  ‘‘Maybe it’s more of a Western phenomenon than a Hong Kong
or an Asian phenomenon, but society is very angry with the
banks, and rightly so because of the damages that have been
caused.  ‘‘There needs to be a new order in banking and banks have
got to be responsible citizens and pay properly.  ‘‘I think now you’re seeing pay levels come down. I think
it is a good thing. It’s more in touch with society. And you
certainly shouldn’t be paying for failure.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
