U.S. stocks advanced, following the
biggest decline in 2012 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
after a private report showed American companies increased
hiring and more investors signed on to a Greek debt swap.  Equities  extended gains  on a report that the  Federal
Reserve  is discussing a new type of bond-buying program.
Financial and industrial shares rose the most among  10 groups  in
the  S&P 500 .  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  advanced
at least 2.2 percent.  Apple (AAPL)  Inc. added 0.1 percent after
introducing a new version of the iPad with a sharper screen.  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 1,352.63 at 4 p.m. New York
time, after slumping 1.5 percent yesterday. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  added 78.18 points, or 0.6 percent, to
12,837.33. The Russell 2000 Index of small companies gained 1.1
percent to 795.95. About 6.1 billion shares  changed hands  on
U.S. exchanges, or 9.1 percent below the three-month average.  “The market just wants to go up,” said  Jack Ablin , who
helps oversee $55 billion as chief investment officer at Harris
Private Bank. “The ADP report was positive. The bigger
participation in the Greek debt swap is encouraging. Plus,
there’s a report that says that the Fed would continue to buy
bonds, but they are not going to expand their balance sheet.”  Stocks rose as companies added 216,000 workers to payrolls
in February, according to ADP Employer Services. The report came
two days before the Labor Department’s monthly jobs data.
 Consumer borrowing  rose more than forecast in January. Optimism
about  Greece ’s debt swap also helped lift stocks. Investors with
58 percent of the Greek bonds eligible for the nation’s debt
swap have so far indicated they’ll participate.  Money Printing  Equities extended gains as the Wall Street Journal said the
Fed would print new money to buy long-term mortgage or Treasury
bonds, then effectively tie up that money by borrowing it back
for short periods at low rates.  “The Fed ought to be saving future bullets for a situation
that requires a strategic intervention,” said  Philip Orlando ,
the New York-based chief equity strategist at Federated
Investors Inc., which oversees about $370 billion. “If the Fed
does something now, what happens if six months from now, Greece
does default and it does throw the world into a recession?
What’s the Fed going to do then?”  Before today, the  S&P 500 (SPX)  had fallen for three straight
days on concern that a rally that restored more than $3.2
trillion to U.S. equity value since October outpaced economic
prospects. The benchmark gauge trades at 13.9 times reported
earnings, below the average since 1954 of 16.4 times.  Banks Rally  Financial shares, which yesterday had the  biggest loss 
among 10 groups in the S&P 500, led the gains today.  Bank of
America  rose 4 percent, the most in the Dow, to $8.02.  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  advanced 1.6 percent to $39.95.  Industrial shares had the second-biggest gain in the S&P
500. Caterpillar advanced 2.2 percent to $108.28. United
Technologies Corp. climbed 1.5 percent to $82.57.  General Electric Co. (GE)  increased 1.9 percent to $18.77. The
world’s biggest maker of  jet engines , power generation
equipment, health-care imaging equipment and locomotives
reiterated its forecast of earnings growth of at least 10
percent from industrial and capital units this year.  Apple rose 0.1 percent to $530.69, trimming a gain of as
much as 1.4 percent. The new iPad will cost $499 to $829 and
include an A5X chip that enables better graphics. It will also
boast a 9.7-inch screen that has more pixels than traditional
high-definition televisions and run on so-called long-term
evolution, or LTE, wireless networks. The device will be
available March 16, and Apple is taking orders starting today.  Significant Upgrade  Chief Executive Officer  Tim Cook  is making the most
significant upgrade yet to Apple’s tablet months before
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  introduces software that will run on competing
devices. The new version is also aimed at helping the company
fend off competition from  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating
system, as well as  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , whose $199 Kindle Fire is
gaining traction among budget-conscious buyers.  Microsoft gained 0.9 percent to $31.84. Google added 0.3
percent to $606.80. Amazon.com rose 1.5 percent to $183.77.  Ciena Corp. (CIEN)  surged 4.2 percent to $14.01. The maker of
 network equipment  for phone companies forecast fiscal second-
quarter revenue that topped some analysts’ estimates. Ciena,
which last month said first-quarter results would suffer from
delays in recording international sales, today predicted
stronger operating results in the second half of the year.  Rival  JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) , the largest maker of fiber-optic
testing equipment, added 2.5 percent to $12.80.  Homebuilders Surge  A measure of homebuilders in S&P indexes jumped 4 percent.
 Lennar Corp. (LEN)  increased 5.6 percent to $23.62. D.R. Horton Inc.
climbed 3.9 percent to $13.99.  Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (HOV)  increased 2.5 percent to $2.46.
The largest homebuilder in  New Jersey  reported a narrower first-
quarter loss as it reduced  writedowns  and increased sales.  Wynn Resorts Ltd. (WYNN)  added 2.4 percent to $122.27. The hotel
and casino operator asked investors to approve the removal of
Japanese billionaire Kazuo Okada as a director, after accusing
him of making improper payments to Philippines gambling
officials.  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT)  fell 1.2 percent to $37.83 for the biggest
decline in the Dow. The company was cut to “hold” from “buy”
by Jefferies Group Inc., which said the stock has little
incentive to outperform this year.  Pandora Media Inc. (P)  plunged 24 percent, the most in the
Russell 1000 Index, to $10.86. The Internet radio pioneer
forecast first-quarter results that missed analysts’ projections
because of a seasonal lull in advertising sales.  Solar stocks declined as  Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) ’s loss
exceeded estimates. Canadian Solar fell 13 percent to $2.85.
 First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  dropped 6.6 percent to $25.80 for the biggest
decline in the S&P 500.  To contact the reporter on this story:
