Saudi Arabia (OPCRSAUD)  should raise oil
production by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day to prevent prices
from damaging the world economy, according to the Centre for
Global Energy Studies.  The world’s largest oil exporter needs to restore daily
production rates to 10 million barrels a day, from 9.8 million
currently, as price levels of more than $120 a barrel are
crimping economic growth, according to the London-based Centre.
Concern that demand is slowing just as  Libya  revives output will
probably deter  Saudi Arabia  from making the necessary increase,
CGES said.  “We’ve been in the danger zone since prices got to $100,”
 Leo Drollas , the CGES’s chief economist, said in a telephone
interview today. “Economic growth will stutter globally;  Europe 
is doldrums, and the U.S. is recovering but precarious.”  Saudi Arabian production is “still not enough, given the
state of the market and prices,” Drollas said. “The market is
tight, and stock cover is low.”  The kingdom is unlikely to bolster supplies by the amount
required, Drollas predicts.  “They’re worried about putting more oil onto the market at
a time when they think demand is not very strong, and likely to
decline further with the European debt crisis,” he said.  Still,  Brent crude  is unlikely to surpass this year’s peak
of $128.40 a barrel during the rest of 2012, as prices are
already high enough to curtail fuel consumption, according to
Drollas.  CGES was founded in 1990 by former Saudi Arabian Oil
Minister Sheikh Ahmad Yamani.  To contact the reporter on this story:
