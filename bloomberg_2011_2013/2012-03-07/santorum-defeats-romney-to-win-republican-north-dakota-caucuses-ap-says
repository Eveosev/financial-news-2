Rick Santorum won the  North Dakota 
Republican presidential caucuses today, the Associated Press and
CNN projected.  North Dakota will send 28 delegates to the Republican
convention in August. The caucus results aren’t binding on the
delegates.  AP and CNN projected Santorum’s victory over former
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, U.S. Representative Ron Paul
of Texas and former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich .  Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania,
campaigned in North Dakota in mid-February, while Romney visited
on March 1. Paul held rallies in the state in February and
returned today seeking caucus support.  North Dakota’s economy improved more than that of any other
state from the first quarter of 2009 to the third quarter of
2011, the latest data available, according to the Bloomberg
Economic Evaluation of States. The index measures such areas as
personal income,  job creation , home prices and tax revenue.  Santorum also won contests today in Oklahoma and Tennessee,
according to AP and television network projections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
