Belarus’s international reserves
climbed to a record high as the former Soviet republic rebuilds
a stockpile ravaged by its balance-of-payments crisis last year.  The gold and foreign-currency holdings rose by $53.9
million to $8.04 billion as of March 1, the central bank said in
an e-mailed  statement  today, citing calculations of the holdings
to International Monetary Fund standards. Higher gold prices and
net purchases of foreign currency boosted the stockpile, the
regulator said.  The level of the nation’s reserves is still insufficient,
 Chris Jarvis , head of the IMF mission in Belarus, told reporters
this week in the capital, Minsk. Belarus, whose currency
depreciated 64 percent against the dollar last year, wants to
secure a new $3.5 billion loan from the Washington-based lender
and extend payments on its debt to the fund, central bank
Chairman Nadezhda Ermakova said in an  interview  with the Belta
news service published yesterday.  The IMF may extend a new bailout facility if the country’s
leadership offers a sound program of measures to stabilize the
economy, Jarvis said, without specifying the possible amount of
financing Belarus may need.  To contact the reporter on this story:
