KanAm Grund KAG (KANGRND)  sold two London
office buildings to investment fund Permodalan Nasional Bhd., a
week after the German property fund said it would liquidate its
3.92 billion-euro ($5.14 billion) Grundinvest fund.  PNB, Malaysia’s biggest state asset manager, bought the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s head office
next to Liverpool Street train station and an office building at
90 High Holborn for an undisclosed price, KanAm said today in an
e-mailed statement.  “The particular attractiveness of these two trophy
buildings is explained by their prominent tenancy and their good
location in the City of the London and Midtown,” Hans-Joachim
Kleinert, managing partner of Frankfurt-based KanAm, said in the
statement.  KanAm’s liquidation of the Grundinvest fund will make it
the largest German mutual property fund to be wound up after
failing to raise enough money to meet investor withdrawals. The
fund’s other London assets are Thomson Reuters Plc’s
headquarters in  Canary Wharf  and Deutsche Bank AG’s U.K. base
near the Bank of England.  PNB, based in  Kuala Lumpur , has more than 40 billion pounds
under management, according to the statement. Earlier this year,
it bought One Silk Street in London, where tenants include law
firm Linklaters LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
