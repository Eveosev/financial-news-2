Seychelles President James Michel
nominated central bank Governor Pierre Laporte as finance
minister for the island nation.  Caroline Abel, the deputy governor, will replace Laporte,
according to a statement posted on the website of Seychelles’
presidency today. The president appointed 10 others to head
government ministries, the statement said. Laporte’s appointment
must still be approved by the National Assembly.  “Seychelles’ economy has stabilized,” Laporte said in a
telephone interview today. “The present euro crisis tends to
have an impact on growth this year primarily because of its
importance in our  tourism industry .”  Laporte worked at the  International Monetary Fund  as an
economist and was the Washington-based fund’s resident
representative in Niger in 2005.  The Seychelles rupee has dropped 3.5 percent this year to
14.0494 per dollar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
