Italy  must focus on boosting
economic growth to help offset the effects of an aging
population,  Bank of Italy  Governor Ignazio Visco said.  Italy, which has one of the world’s lowest birth rates, is
above all “a country of old people,” Visco said at a
conference in  Rome  about women in the economy. “This makes the
challenge of economic growth not only difficult, but decisive.”  The country also needs to overhaul its  labor laws  to
encourage hiring, he said. In southern Italy only about one
quarter of young people have jobs and there are more than 2
million young people in Italy, mostly women, who don’t work or
study, Visco said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
