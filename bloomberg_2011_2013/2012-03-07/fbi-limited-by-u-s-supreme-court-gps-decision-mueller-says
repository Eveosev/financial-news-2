A U.S.  Supreme Court  decision
limiting police power to track people using GPS devices will
“inhibit” the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s ability to use
them in probes, said  Robert Mueller , the agency’s director.  “It will inhibit our ability to use this in a number of
surveillances where it has been tremendously beneficial,”
Mueller said today in testimony to a U.S. House Appropriations
subcommittee when asked about the Supreme Court’s January
decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
