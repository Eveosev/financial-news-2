ASM International NV (ASM) ,  Europe ’s
second-largest maker of semiconductor equipment, declined
1.8 percent after earnings fell and subsidiary
 ASM Pacific Technology Ltd. (522)  lowered its dividend.  ASMI dropped 46 cents to 25.90 euros at the close of
trading in Amsterdam, reducing the company’s market value to
1.41 billion euros ($1.85 billion). ASM Pacific Technology fell
5.5 percent to HK$98.80 at the close of Hong Kong trading, the
largest decline since October.  ASMI, based in Almere, the Netherlands, makes front-end
machines for the fabrication process where chips are formed from
the silicon wafer. It owns about 52 percent of ASM Pacific
Technology, the world’s biggest maker of chip-assembly and
packaging equipment, known as back-end gear.  “Back-end margins and orders in the fourth quarter were
lower than expected and the sharply lower dividend at ASM PT is
disappointing,”  Victor Bareno , an analyst at  SNS Securities (SNSWRNT) 
with a “buy” recommendation on ASMI shares, said by phone. The
ASM PT subsidiary lowered its final dividend to HK$0.80 a share
from HK$2.10, missing Bareno’s estimate of H$2.00.  Operating profit at ASMI’s back-end unit dropped to 17.7
million euros from 90 million euros a year earlier, the company
said in a statement last night. That missed SNS Securities’
estimate of 21 million euros. Operating profit at ASMI’s front-
end business fell to 9.5 million euros from 12.5 million euros.  The company predicted lower sales in both operations in the
first quarter, with an improvement after that.  “Demand for sophisticated wireless devices like
smartphones will continue to drive growth,” Chief Executive
Officer Chuck del Prado said on a conference call today.  Net income declined to 15 million euros from 25 million
euros, while sales were unchanged at 352 million euros. ASMI
increased its dividend to 50 cents a share for 2011 from 40
cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
