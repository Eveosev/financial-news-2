Polish bonds gained, pushing yields
on two-year notes lower, after the central bank said zloty
appreciation and economic slowdown will help curb inflation in
the medium term.  The yield on two-year bonds maturing in January 2014
dropped three basis points to 4.65 percent as of 5:22 p.m. in
Warsaw, the biggest decline in three weeks.  While the central bank raised the inflation forecast in its
projection released today, Governor  Marek Belka  said at the news
conference that the latest data would “significantly lower”
the price growth from previous calculations.  “The market has taken it positively,” Marek Kaczor, head
of fixed-income trading at PKO Bank Polski SA said by phone from
Warsaw. “A lighter tone of the statement may suggest that the
central bankers will become less hawkish going forward.”  The bank said 2012 inflation will average from 3.6 percent
to 4.5 percent, compared with its previous projection in
November of 2.5 percent to 3.9 percent. Price growth will slow
to a range from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent in 2013, compared
with an earlier 2.2 percent to 3.7 percent projection, according
to the central bank.  The zloty has strengthened 7.3 percent this year after
depreciating 11 percent last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
