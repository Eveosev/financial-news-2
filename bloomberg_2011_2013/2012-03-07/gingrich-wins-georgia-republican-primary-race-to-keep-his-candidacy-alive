Former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich  won the Republican presidential primary in his home
state of Georgia,  CNN ,  Fox News  and the Associated Press
projected, keeping his candidacy alive.  The win in  Georgia (BEESGA)  marks Gingrich’s first victory since
Jan. 21 in South Carolina, and he still faces an uphill climb
against former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and former
Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, who lead in national polls
and the delegate count.  Gingrich had almost 49 percent of the vote, Santorum was
second with 23 percent, Romney had 22 percent and Texas
Representative Ron Paul 6 percent with 31 percent of precincts
reporting, according to the AP.  “I hope the analysts in Washington and  New York  who spent
June and July explaining our campaign was dead will watch this
tonight and learn a little bit from this crowd and from this
place,” Gingrich told supporters in Atlanta. He said the
“national elite” had tried to kill his candidacy because his
presidency would be “frightening” to the establishment.  Georgia  has the biggest cache of convention delegates
among the 11 states holding contests today. Most of its 76
delegates will be awarded proportionally based on voting by
congressional district and the statewide totals.  Before tonight, Gingrich described Georgia as a must-win
state for him.  “You lose all credibility if the folks who know you best
repudiate you,” Gingrich said on CBS’s “Face the Nation”
program on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
