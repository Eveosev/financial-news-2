Global mergers and acquisitions may
pick up in 2012 as more companies pursue deals in faster-growing
markets such as  Brazil  and  China , according to a survey of
takeover professionals by Brunswick Group LLC.  Of the more than 100 M&A bankers and lawyers polled by
Brunswick, 77 percent predicted that dealmaking worldwide would
remain steady or increase. Almost half of those polled expect an
increase in North American takeover volume this year, as
improving economic conditions, cash on balance sheets and
executive confidence drive deals.  Brazil will be the top deal market outside the U.S.,
according to 69 percent of those surveyed, followed by China and
 Canada . More than two-thirds of those surveyed expect Asian
acquisitions of U.S. companies, compared with 56 percent in last
year’s survey. Energy, natural resources and health care will
see the most volume.  “We’re more focused on international and cross-border as
compared with last year,” Steven Lipin, a senior partner at
Brunswick Group, said in a telephone interview. “It means we’re
going to see more companies deal with cross-border government
concerns.”  Of the China-based M&A advisers, polled by Brunswick for
the first time, 57 percent said they expect more global deals
this year compared with 2011, while 74 percent expect more
domestic transactions. The biggest challenge for overseas buyers
of Chinese companies will be getting regulatory approval from
the Chinese government, according to 70 percent of the China-
based advisers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
