Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  FedEx
Corp. (FDX)  and  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  are among 20 stocks that may be
most hurt should oil supplies dwindle, said  Jonathan Golub ,
chief U.S. market strategist at UBS AG.  Auto, transportation, materials, banking and diversified
financial companies would be most affected by a supply
disruption, Golub wrote in a note today. He cited a March 4
report from UBS oil analyst Julius Walker, who outlined
scenarios related to Iran, and said  Brent crude  might rise to
between $130 and $270 a barrel, though he expects any increase
to be short-lived. Brent for April settlement rose 1.6 percent
to $123.90 a barrel at 12:13 p.m. New York time today.  Brent climbed 22 percent from Oct. 4 through yesterday as
West Texas Intermediate rose 38 percent, amid improved economic
data and central-bank quantitative-easing and low-rate policies,
Golub said in the note. Concern U.S. and European sanctions
against  Iran  will lead to military conflict in the  Persian Gulf ,
home to more than half the world’s oil reserves, has also
boosted prices.  “These stocks should lag in the event of a supply shock,”
New York-based Golub said in the note where he named the 20
stocks including Goldman and FedEx. “Energy and defensive
sectors should outperform on a relative basis.”  Golub said that at current levels, energy prices support
continued profit growth and are consistent with his year-end
price estimate for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of 1,475, and
his prediction for earnings per share of the gauge’s components
of $103. The  S&P 500   rose  0.6 percent to 1,351.52 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
