Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT) , Portugal’s
biggest retailer by market value, fell the most in five months
after its full-year profit came in lower than analysts expected.  “The stock is being punished because company results were
below analysts’ estimates,” said Juan Dieste, a trader at Orey
iTrade in Lisbon.  The shares fell as much as 5.2 percent to 12.91 euros, the
biggest drop in five months, and traded at 13.19 euros at 11:16
a.m. in Lisbon trading.  Jeronimo Martins’ net income gained 21 percent to 340
million euros ($446 million) in 2011, the company said today in
a regulatory filing. That missed the 363.5 million-euro average
of 10 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  A weak economy in  Portugal , where Jeronimo Martins owns the
Pingo Doce hypermarket and Recheio wholesale brands, has
prompted the retailer to focus its investments in  Poland , where
its Biedronka chain is the biggest discount grocer, and
 Colombia , its third market.  “We would not rule out some price pressure after this
neutral to negative set of results as Jeronimo Martins is by
nature an outperformer,” Banco BPI said in a research report
today. “Nevertheless, we were already expecting less glamorous
fourth-quarter results and therefore we would recommend
investors to take advantage of potential price weakness.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
