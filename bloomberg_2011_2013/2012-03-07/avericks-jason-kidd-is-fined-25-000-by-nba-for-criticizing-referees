Dallas Mavericks point guard  Jason Kidd  was fined $25,000 today by the  National Basketball
Association  for public criticism of officiating.  Kidd was cited for comments he made following the team’s
95-91 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on March 5, league
Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Stu Jackson
said in an e-mailed statement.  The defending-champion Mavericks were outscored 8-0 over
the final 2 minutes, 24 seconds. Kidd objected to the fourth-
quarter officiating, specifically a foul on center Ian Mahinmi
that allowed Oklahoma City to take the lead for good at the
free-throw line with 46 seconds remaining.  “He didn’t foul him,” Kidd, 38, said according to ESPN.
“It was a bad call. Clean block. It was a bad night for the
officials. It happens.”  Kidd also said that the Mavericks aren’t viewed as NBA
champions by officials, and that forward  Dirk Nowitzki  should
“live at the line if they would call it the way it’s supposed
to be,” according to ESPN.  A 10-time All-Star, Kidd leads active players in games
played (1,297) and assists (11,745). He is averaging 5.4 points
and 5.6 assists per game this season, his 18th in the NBA.  The Mavericks (23-17) are 3-6 in their last nine games,
including a 95-85 victory over the  New York Knicks  last night.
The team next plays tomorrow night at the  Phoenix Suns .  To contact the reporter on this story:
