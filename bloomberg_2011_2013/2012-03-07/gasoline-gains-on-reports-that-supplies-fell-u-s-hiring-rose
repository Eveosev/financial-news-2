Gasoline advanced for the first time
in five days after reports that U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell
last week and American companies increased hiring in February.  Futures rose after the industry-funded  American Petroleum
Institute  said yesterday that gasoline inventories sank 2.25
million barrels. Employment rose by 216,000 last month,
according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The Energy
Department will report on oil supplies today and the Labor
Department will release February employment data on March 9.  “The ADP number is definitely a step in the right
direction,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at
PFGBest in  Chicago . “We’re supposed to draw down in supply
because we’re getting rid of that overhang in winter
inventories.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 2.52 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $3.2551 a gallon at 9:44 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices have gained 21 percent this year,
making gasoline the best-performing commodity in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw materials.  The Labor Department will probably report that overall
payrolls, which include government workers, rose by 210,000 in
February and the  unemployment rate  held at 8.3 percent,
according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “The labor market news looks good and the dollar is giving
up some of its gains,” said  James Cordier , portfolio manager at
OptionSellers.com in Tampa,  Florida . “Over the next few days we
could attract investors who are looking forward to a spring
rally in gasoline.”  Gasoline Stockpiles  U.S. stockpiles of  gasoline  probably fell 1.6 million
barrels last week, based on the median estimate of 10 analysts
in a survey by Bloomberg News. That would be the third
consecutive decline.  Distillate (DOEASDIS)  inventories probably declined 1.65 million
barrels, according to the survey. That would leave supplies at
the lowest level since the week ended Dec. 16, according to
department data. The API reported that stockpiles rose 924,000
barrels. The department is scheduled to release its report at
10:30 a.m. today in  Washington .  April-delivery heating oil slipped 0.02 cent to $3.188 a
gallon on the exchange. Prices are up 8.6 percent this year.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.3
cent to $3.761 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data. Prices
have increased 15 percent this year, and are 7.2 percent higher
than a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
