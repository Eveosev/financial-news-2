Advent International Corp. is
revising the structure of 770 million euros ($1 billion) of
loans to back its purchase of the smartcard unit of Francois-
Charles Oberthur SA, according to a person with direct knowledge
of the deal.  The financing will now include a 410 million-euro, seven-
year  term loan  B, of which $250 million will be offered to
investors in the U.S., said the person, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. It will also have a
100 million-euro second lien facility, a 100 million-euro, six-
year term loan A, a 100 million-euro acquisition facility and 60
million euros of credit lines.  The $250 million U.S. dollar-denominated piece will pay 5
percentage points more than the London interbank offered rate,
according to the person. Libor, the rate banks say they can
borrow in dollars from each other, will have a 1.25 percent
floor.  The debt will be sold to investors at 97 cents to 97.5
cents on the dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the
company and boosting the yield to investors.  Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Plc and Lloyds Bank are
arranging the financing, said the person.  Chuck Dohrenwend, a spokesman for Advent, declined to
comment.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan, it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
