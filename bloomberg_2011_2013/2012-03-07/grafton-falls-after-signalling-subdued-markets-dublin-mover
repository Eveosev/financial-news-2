Grafton Group Plc (GN5)  fell 4.2 percent
in Dublin trading after saying today that it expects subdued
markets to result in “flattish” sales this year.  The Dublin-based building product supplier fell 11.7 cents,
or 3.2 percent, to 3.17 euros as of 8:42 a.m., the lowest since
Feb. 21. The stock had risen 38 percent this year before today’s
announcement.  Grafton is cutting costs to boost profit as tighter
mortgage lending in its main markets results in fewer house
starts. Chief Executive Officer Gavin Slark said in an interview
today that he sees a “little bit” of growth in the U.K.  this
year driven by price rather than volume growth.  “If you look at both the U.K. and Ireland, we would say
both of them would be subdued during 2012,” said Slark. “There
are different economic pressures in both of those
key countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
