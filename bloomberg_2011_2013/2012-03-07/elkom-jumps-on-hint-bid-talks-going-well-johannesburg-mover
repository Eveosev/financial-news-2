Telkom South Africa Ltd. (TKG)  rose the
most in almost three years after  KT Corp. (030200)  said it’s still in
talks to buy a stake in  Africa ’s biggest fixed-line phone
company.  Telkom shares advanced 5.3 percent to close at 26.68 rand,
the highest in more than two weeks and the biggest increase
since July 2009.  “It’s going well,” KT Corp. Chairman Lee Suk Chae said in
an interview at a conference in Seoul today.  The stock declined 2 percent on Feb. 29 when Absa Asset
Management and MMI Asset Management said  South Korea ’s largest
phone and Internet company may reduce its potential offer price
for a 20 percent stake in Telkom or abandon the 3.8 billion-rand
($497 million) transaction. Telkom said on Oct. 14 it may sell
new shares at 36.06 rand each to allow KT to acquire a stake in
the company. The shares fell 21 percent from Oct. 14 to Feb. 29.  “We are getting more direction on the transaction,” Paul
Chakaduka, a Johannesburg-based trader at Global Trader said by
phone. “Getting government to loosen control would be ideal for
Telkom and getting a suitor who has expertise, especially in
data and mobile” would be beneficial, he said.  The South African government holds 39.8 percent of Telkom
while a South African state pension fund manager, the Public
Investment Corp., owns 10.9 percent, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
