John Lewis  Partnership Plc, owner of
the U.K.’s largest department-store chain, said annual profit
fell 3.8 percent and reduced its staff bonus for the first time
in three years after matching competitors’ discounts.  Pretax profit declined to 353.8 million pounds ($557
million) in the year ended Jan. 28, from 367.9 million pounds a
year earlier, the employee-owned  company  said today. John Lewis
cut the staff bonus by 15 percent to 165.2 million pounds.  John Lewis has ramped up promotions and extended its Never
Knowingly Undersold promise to include online competitors as it
seeks to keep customers spending amid the Eurozone debt crisis
and rising unemployment. U.K. retail sales fell for a second
month in February as a drop in purchases of clothing countered
gains at food stores, the  British Retail Consortium  said.  “Current trading conditions are still difficult and
 consumer confidence  remains subdued,” Chairman Charlie Mayfield
said in a statement. Mayfield said he’s “cautiously
optimistic” that the climate may improve later in the year, as
celebrations for Queen Elizabeth II’s Diamond Jubilee and the
London  Olympic Games  provide “a lift for consumers.”  Sales in the first five weeks of the current fiscal year
rose 7.7 percent, excluding value-added tax, the retailer said.
Growth was led by an increase of 8.9 percent at the Waitrose
grocery chain. Revenue at John Lewis department stores gained
5.2 percent, or 2.4 percent at stores open at least a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
