Rescue teams searched for Afghans
trapped in their homes by avalanches that killed 42 people in
the country’s mountainous northeastern province of Badakhshan.  At least six other people were wounded by the snow slips in
three districts of the province, Abdul Maruf Rasekh, spokesman
for Badakhshan’s government, said today by phone.  “Up to 100 rescuers equipped with shovels have found 42
dead bodies,” Rasekh said. The avalanches destroyed a village
of about 200 people, he said.  The Ministry of Defense has sent helicopters along with
Afghan soldiers to help rescue efforts, he said. “The death
toll may rise” as the snow is cleared, Rasekh said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
