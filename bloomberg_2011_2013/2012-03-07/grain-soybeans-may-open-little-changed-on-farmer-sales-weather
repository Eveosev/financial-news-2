What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open down 1 cent a bushel to 1
cent higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after U.S. farmers
increased sales following a rally on March 5 to the highest in
almost four months,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C Trading
Co. in Fowler, Indiana, said in a telephone interview. Dry
weather threatens to expand a U.S. Midwest drought before the
planting season, he said.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1 cent
higher on the CBOT as U.S. and South American farmers boosted
sales after prices reached a five-month high, while dry weather
threatens yields in parts of  Brazil , Gerlach said. Soybean-oil
futures are expected to open 0.35 cent to 0.45 cent a pound
higher, and soybean-meal futures may open 50 cents to $1.50
lower per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent a bushel lower to 1 cent higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that the sluggish global economy
will cut consumption, while hot, dry weather may reduce yields
in the southern U.S. Great Plains, Gerlach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
