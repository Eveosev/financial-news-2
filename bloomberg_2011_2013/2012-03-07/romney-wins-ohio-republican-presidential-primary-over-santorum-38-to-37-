Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the Republican presidential primary in Ohio, the
Associated Press projected, overcoming a challenge from former
Pennsylvania Senator  Rick Santorum .  Romney had 38 percent of the vote, with 99 percent of
precincts reporting, compared with 37 percent for Santorum,
almost 15 percent for former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich
and 9 percent for U.S. Representative Ron Paul of Texas.  Santorum and Romney had been running close in polls of
voters in  Ohio (BEESOH) , a bellwether for November’s general election
with one of the largest caches of electoral votes. Both
candidates focused their resources on the state, with Santorum
trying to build a coalition of lower-income voters, evangelical
Christians and Catholics.  Ohio awards its 66 delegates for the  Republican National
Convention  on a proportional basis by congressional district.
It’s one of 11 states that held contests on Super Tuesday in the
race for the Republican presidential nomination. Only  Georgia ,
Gingrich’s home state, has more delegates at stake for the
convention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
