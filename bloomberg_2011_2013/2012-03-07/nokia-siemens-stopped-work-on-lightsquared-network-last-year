Nokia Siemens Networks, the joint
venture between  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and  Siemens AG (SIE) , said it stopped work
in 2011 on the U.S. wireless network for  LightSquared Inc. (SKYT)   “While we have a contract with LightSquared, they
previously asked us to put our activities related to the network
build on hold while they resolve” issues concerning Global
Positioning System technology, Ben Roome, a spokesman, said by
e-mail. LightSquared originally planned to spend $7 billion over
eight years on the network to set up a national carrier
competing against  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  Verizon Wireless , it said in
July 2010.  The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said last month
it would block LightSquared’s planned network because of
potential disruption to navigation gear. The company said after
the decision that it was committed to finding a solution to the
concerns.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  plans to end a network-sharing
agreement with LightSquared that would have helped the venture
with expansion costs, two people familiar with the plan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
