Simcere Pharmaceutical Group (SCR) , a
Chinese drugmaker, jumped the most since 2008 after reporting
that 2011 profit rose, beating analysts’ forecasts.  Simcere’s American depositary receipts jumped 7.5 percent,
the biggest intraday gain since Dec. 30, to $8.90 by 10:23 a.m.
in New York. The stock earlier rose as much as 19 percent, the
largest advance since November 2008. Each ADR represents two
common shares.  Net income of Simcere, based in Nanjing in  China ’s eastern
Jiangsu province, rose 3.5 percent last year to 178.4 million
yuan ($28.3 million), the company said in a statement today
before U.S. markets opened. That exceeded the 142.4 million yuan
 average forecast  of six analysts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company said fourth-quarter profit declined 27 percent
from a year earlier to 42.8 million yuan, compared with a 39.4
million yuan average estimate of two analysts. Simcere was the
biggest gainer on the  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-
traded Chinese stocks in the U.S. today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
