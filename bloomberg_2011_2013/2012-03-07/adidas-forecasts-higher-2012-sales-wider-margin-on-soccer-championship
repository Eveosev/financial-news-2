Adidas AG (ADS) , the second-largest
sporting-goods maker, forecast more modest growth in 2012 profit
than analysts had predicted, sending the shares lower.  Net income may rise to between 736 million euros ($967
million) and 770 million euros, Katja Schreiber, a spokeswoman
for the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company, said today.
That’s less than the 780.6 million-euro average of seven
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Adidas fell as much as 3.8 percent in Frankfurt trading,
the steepest intraday drop since Dec. 12. Profitability gains
this year will be restricted by rising costs of raw materials
and labor, particularly in the first half, the owner of the
Reebok brand said. Adidas reiterated its November forecast that
2012 earnings per share will increase 10 percent to 15 percent.  “People are a bit disappointed,” Thomas Effler, an
analyst at WestLB AG in  Frankfurt , said by phone. “They were
expecting a higher guidance.”  Adidas was down 2.2 percent at 56.48 euros as of 10:26
a.m., trimming the  stock’s  gain this year to 12 percent.  Currency-neutral sales will probably increase “at a mid-to
high-single-digit rate” this year and the operating margin will
approach 8 percent, the company said.  Adidas reported fourth-quarter net income increased to 18
million euros from 7 million euros a year earlier, beating the
16.8 million-euro average of eight analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Fourth-quarter sales rose 11 percent to 3.26
billion euros, also exceeding estimates.  China, Russia  Sales in greater  China  climbed 23 percent to 1.23 billion
euros in 2011 and Chief Executive Officer  Herbert Hainer  said
today he is “fully confident” revenue growth in that market
will be “double-digit” this year. Russian sales will exceed 1
billion euros this year, meeting a goal one year early, he
added.  Adidas expects  earnings  this year to benefit from demand
related to the European soccer finals and  London   Olympic Games .
The company has about 34 percent of the global soccer market and
is the official partner of European governing body UEFA for the
finals, which start in June in Poland and Ukraine.  Hainer said he expects Reebok sales to decline this year.
The fitness brand posted a 2.5 percent sales increase to 1.96
billion euros in 2011. That compares with a 13 percent sales
increase for the Adidas brand.  “The Adidas brand looks set for another buoyant year after
successful product launches, boosted by Euro 2012 in June and
the Olympics in July and August,” said Julian Easthope, an
analyst at  Barclays Capital  in London, in a March 2 report.
Reebok “is likely to have a more difficult year against a tough
competition with limited new innovation.”  The smaller competitor of  Nike Inc. (NKE)  proposed a  dividend  of
1 euro a share, up from the prior year’s 80 cents. That matched
the average estimate of 21 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
