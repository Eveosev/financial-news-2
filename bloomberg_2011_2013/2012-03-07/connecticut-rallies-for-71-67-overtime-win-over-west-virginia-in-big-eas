The University of  Connecticut ,
 Georgetown University , the  University of Louisville  and the
University of South Florida advanced to the quarterfinals of the
 Big East conference  men’s basketball tournament.  Connecticut beat  West Virginia  University 71-67 in overtime,
rallying from an 11-point second-half deficit. Henry Sims had 20
points and 13 rebounds to lead Georgetown to a 64-52 win against
Pittsburgh, Peyton Siva’s 14 points led Louisville to a 61-55
defeat of Seton Hall and Anthony Collins scored 17 points in
South Florida’s 56-47 win over Villanova.  Shabazz Napier scored 20 of his 26 points in the second
half for ninth-seeded Connecticut, which held the same seed last
year in winning on five straight days to take the Big East
championship. The Huskies, who went on to win last season’s
national title, will face top seed Syracuse today.  “Their front court dominated for most of the game,” said
Huskies coach  Jim Calhoun . “Our back court held its own, and
then took over and won the game for us.”  West Virginia led by 11 points midway through the second
half at Madison Square Garden in  New York  before Connecticut
responded. Napier missed a 3-point attempt in the closing
seconds that would have given Connecticut the win. He fouled out
during overtime.  The Mountaineers had a 40-24 rebound advantage in the game.
They had 21 offensive rebounds, including four from forward
Deniz Kilicli, who fouled out with 4 minutes, 20 seconds
remaining and West Virginia leading by nine.  Overtime  Napier scored nine points in those final four minutes and
Connecticut (20-12) outscored West Virginia 6-2 in the extra
period, helped by a 3-pointer from Jeremy Lamb, who finished
with 22 points and eight rebounds.  Kevin Jones led the eighth-seeded Mountaineers (19-13) with
25 points and 10 rebounds.  “There’s nothing like coming to the Garden to play in the
tournament,” West Virginia coach Bob Huggins said. “We’ve
enjoyed it, most of it, anyway.”  In today’s other quarterfinal games, No. 5 Georgetown plays
fourth-seeded Cincinnati; seventh-seeded Louisville meets No. 2
Marquette and No. 6  South Florida  takes on third-seeded  Notre
Dame .  The five-round tournament concludes March 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
