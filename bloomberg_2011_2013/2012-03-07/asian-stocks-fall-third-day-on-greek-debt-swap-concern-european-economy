Asian  stocks  fell for a third day,
with the regional benchmark  index (CRY)  headed for the lowest close in
a month, amid concern about a  Greece  debt-swap deal and after
reports showed European gross domestic product contracted and
 Australia ’s economy grew less than forecast.  Sony Corp. (6758) ,  Japan ’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics,
slid 2.4 percent.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  lost 3.8 percent in
Sydney as metal prices dropped.  China  Life Insurance Co. slumped
6.1 percent in  Hong Kong  after saying profit may have fallen by
half last year.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the
most actively traded stock by volume in the regional benchmark
index today, dropped amid speculation Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
will sell its shares in the bank.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid 0.8 percent to 124.54 as
of 7:59 p.m. in Tokyo, set for the lowest close since Feb. 3.
All 10 industry groups on the measure fell, with more than two
stocks dropping for each that rose.  “We are seeing a correction after a rapid rally,” said
Hitoshi Asaoka, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho Trust
& Banking Co. “The major trend in  Europe  hasn’t changed in that
banks strengthen their capital, which leads to a credit crunch
and an economic slowdown. The market will remain sensitive to
European news flow until Greece makes it through March 20,” a
bond redemption date.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average lost 0.6 percent and  South
Korea ’s Kospi Index declined 0.9 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 fell 1.5 percent after a report showed the nation’s economy
grew at half the pace economists forecast last quarter amid a
slump in housing construction.  European Slowdown  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index dropped 0.9 percent amid
trading volume that was 25 percent above the  30-day intraday
average . The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger
of China’s stock exchanges, fell 0.7 percent as the National
People’s Congress meets this week.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  added 0.5
percent today. The gauge sank 1.5 percent in  New York  yesterday,
the biggest drop since Dec. 8, amid concern may not convince
enough of its creditors to trade their bonds for new ones, at a
loss of as much as 75 percent, before tomorrow’s deadline.  Shares also fell after a report showed the euro region’s
 gross domestic product  shrank 0.3 percent last quarter from the
previous period.  ‘Enough Participants’  “There’s concern about whether or not there will be enough
participants in the Greek debt swap,” Michael Koskuba, who
helps oversee $28 million at Victory Capital Management Inc. in
New York, said in a telephone interview. “The fear is that if
it doesn’t happen the way most want it to happen, there’s
potential for a greater recession in Europe.”  Private investors who have so far declared their
participation in Greece’s debt restructuring hold only about
one-fifth of the bonds involved in the swap required for a
bailout.  Sony, which depends on Europe for a fifth of its sales,
dropped 2.4 percent to 1,638 yen.  Cosco Pacific Ltd. (1199) , which
operates container facilities at Greece’s Piraeus port, declined
1.3 percent to HK$11.10 in Hong Kong.  Mining companies fell after the London Metal Exchange Index
of prices for six industrial commodities including copper and
aluminum sank 2.6 percent yesterday, falling the most since Feb.
10. The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB  Index (CRY)  of raw materials
dropped 1.6 percent.  Newcrest, Inpex  Newcrest Mining lost 3.8 percent to A$30.60 in Sydney.
 Minmetals Resources Ltd. (1208)  fell 2.4 percent to HK$4.01 in Hong
Kong.  Inpex Corp. (1605) , Japan’s No. 1 energy explorer, lost 1.1
percent to 550,000 yen.  China Life Insurance lost 6.1 percent to HK$20.80 after the
Beijing-based insurer yesterday said 2011 profit may have fallen
by between 40 percent and 50 percent from the previous year on
lower investment yields and bigger impairment losses.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 10.2 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 6.8 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 5.7 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 14.6 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.9 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (1398)  slid 1.1 percent to
HK$5.20 after saying a lock-up period barring the sale of its
shares had ended, giving Goldman Sachs the right to sell its
stake. Shares of the lender, the world’s biggest by market
value, slid 3.8 percent yesterday after  South China Morning Post 
reported Goldman Sachs approached several institutions about the
possibility of selling a “big chunk” of its shares.  Among stocks that rose, Aeon Credit Service Co. gained 4.8
percent to 1,281 yen in Tokyo. The credit card company said it
will buy back as much as 8.93 percent of its outstanding shares
from March 7 through March 6, 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
