Exports of North Sea Ekofisk crude
for April will rise to 14 cargoes, one more than this month, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The April program comprises nine 600,000-barrel cargoes,
four 650,000-barrel shipments and one 700,000-barrel lot. It
totals 8.7 million barrels, or 290,000 barrels a day, compared
with 254,839 barrels a day in March, the plan showed.  Ekofisk is one of four North Sea oil grades that make up
the Dated Brent benchmark, which is used to price crude from the
 Middle East ,  Africa  and  Russia . The other blends are Forties,
Brent and Oseberg.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
