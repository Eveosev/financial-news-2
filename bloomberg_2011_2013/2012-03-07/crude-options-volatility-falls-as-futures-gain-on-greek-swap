Crude oil options volatility
retreated from a six-week high as underlying futures rose after
more investors agreed to a Greek debt swap, boosting optimism
that the European debt crisis will be contained.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.1 as of 3 p.m., down from 31.2
yesterday.  “We’re getting a little bit rangebound and there was no
significant buying today,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president
of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  Crude for April delivery rose $1.46, or 1.4 percent, to
settle at $106.16 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Since Feb. 17, the front-month contract has traded in a range of
$104.26 and $110.55.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
April $95 puts, with 2,545 lots changing hands at 3:24 p.m. They
fell 11 cents to 5 cents a barrel. April $100 puts, the second-
most active options, declined 33 cents to 26 cents with 1,995
lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 53 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
