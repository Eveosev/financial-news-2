A decline in the number of U.S.
homes that may have to be sold is “undeniably providing support
for a nascent recovery” in housing, according to Robert C. Wetenhall Jr., an analyst at RBC Capital Markets LLC.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays the total number of homes
that have entered foreclosure proceedings or have mortgages at
least 30 days overdue, according to quarterly data compiled by
the  Mortgage Bankers Association .  In last year’s fourth quarter, so-called shadow inventory
amounted to 5.13 million. The figure was the lowest in three
years and 18 percent below its peak, reached in the third
quarter of 2009.  “The trend positions the housing market to benefit from
tighter supply levels in the future,” Wetenhall wrote yesterday
in a report that examined U.S. homebuilders’ outlook for their
spring selling season.  Builders will start working on 700,000 new homes this year,
according to Wetenhall, who increased his estimate by 50,000.
The New York-based analyst’s current projection almost matches
January’s annual rate of 699,000 starts, as compiled by the
Commerce Department.  KB Home (KBH)  and  Lennar Corp. (LEN)  are his top stock picks in the
industry. Both builders have outperform’ ratings, which means
they are poised to beat their peers during the next 12 months.
D.R. Horton Inc., PulteGroup Inc. and  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  are
rated sector perform.  To contact the reporter on this story:
