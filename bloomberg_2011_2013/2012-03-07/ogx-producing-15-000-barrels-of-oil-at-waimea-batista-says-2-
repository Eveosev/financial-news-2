OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3) ,
the  oil company  controlled by  Eike Batista , is producing 15,000
barrels of crude per day after starting output at an offshore
well in  Brazil  earlier this year, the billionaire said.  OGX expects to almost triple output to 40,000 barrels of
oil a day by mid-year, Batista, 55, said during a telephone
interview from Rio de Janeiro on March 2. The company is working
to connect a second well to the Waimea field in about 45 days
and a third one by mid-2012, he said.  Brazil’s second-biggest oil company by market value
produced its first oil at Waimea, in the waters of Rio’s Campos
basin, on Jan. 31, seven months after its original target. The
company said last year it expects to produce as much as 50,000
barrels a day in 2012, rising to 730,000 barrels a day by 2015.  OGX accounts for about two thirds of Batista’s wealth,
helping make him the world’s 10th-richest person, according to
the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His net worth fell $546
million yesterday to $29.2 billion as sliding commodity prices
sent share prices for his empire of natural-resource and
logistics startups lower.  OGX  gained  1.2 percent to 17.11 reais in  Sao Paulo . Before
today, the stock rose 24 percent during 2012, more than the 15
percent increase of Brazil’s Bovespa Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
