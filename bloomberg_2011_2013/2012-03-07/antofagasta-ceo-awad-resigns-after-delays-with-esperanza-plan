Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) ’s Chief Executive
Officer  Marcelo Awad  resigned, a week before the copper producer
controlled by  Chile ’s Luksic family plans to post 2011 results,
following delays in ramping up its Esperanza plant.  “Awad has advised the board of his resignation as chief
executive officer of Antofagasta Minerals SA with immediate
effect,” the company said in a statement today. Chairman Jean- Paul Luksic will take over on an interim basis, it said.  Antofagasta in June cut its 2011 output forecast to 620,000
metric tons to 640,000 tons, from the 715,000 tons it projected
in February last year, after delays at Esperanza. The company
produced 640,500 tons, it said Feb. 1. The company seeks to
increase output to about 700,000 tons this year, it said.  The 2011 results, due March 13, will be “in line with
market expectations,” the company said. “As a group, we will
continue to pursue our current strategy of growth, supported by
our strong financial position and low-cost and profitable
operations,” Luksic said in the statement.  Antofagasta’s 2011 full-year net income will probably rise
to $1.26 billion from $1.05 billion a year earlier, according to
the average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The producer, seeking to diversify outside Chile by buying
early stage projects, in November failed to get a mining license
for a $3.4 billion Pakistan copper and gold venture with  Barrick
Gold Corp. (ABX)  Awad was hired in 2004, according to the statement.  Antofagasta fell 0.6 percent to 1,230 pence at the close in
 London , giving the company a market value of 12.1 billion pounds
($19 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
