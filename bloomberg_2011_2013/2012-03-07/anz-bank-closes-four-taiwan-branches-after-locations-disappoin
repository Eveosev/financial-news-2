Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. (ANZ)  is closing four branches in  Taiwan  that it said
weren’t in the best locations to serve its customers.  The closures will reduce ANZ’s branch network in the
country to 14 and the Melbourne-based lender will open a
flagship branch in a “key location” shortly, it said in an e-
mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
