Poland ’s central bank raised its
forecast for inflation this year while predicting slower
economic growth in 2012 and 2013 in the latest projections
prepared by its research unit, the Warsaw-based Narodowy Bank
Polski said in a statement after keeping  interest rates 
unchanged today.  The central bank said 2012 inflation will average from 3.6
percent to 4.5 percent, compared with its previous projection in
November of 2.5 percent to 3.9 percent. Price growth will slow
to a range from 2.2 percent to 3.6 percent in 2013, compared
with an earlier 2.2 percent to 3.7 percent projection, according
to the central bank.  The price-growth forecasts incorporated data available
through Jan. 24. If data released since then had been included,
the inflation projection for this year would be lowered by 0.3
to 0.4 percentage points, and for 2013 by 0.2 to 0.3 percentage
points, according to the Monetary Policy Council’s statement.  The rate-setting panel decided to include this adjustment
“as a kind of annex” to the projections prepared by the
central bank’s research institute, Governor Belka told reporters
at a news briefing. He said the adjustments produce a
“significantly lower path” for inflation.  The NBP said it forecast economic growth at between 2.2
percent and 3.8 percent this year, compared with an earlier view
of growth between 2.0 percent and 4.1 percent. Its forecast for
2013 economic growth was 1.1 percent to 3.5 percent, compared
with 1.5 percent to 4 percent in the November projection.  To contact the reporter on this story:
