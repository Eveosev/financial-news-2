Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  plans to end a
network-sharing agreement with billionaire  Philip Falcone ’s
 LightSquared Inc. (SKYT)  wireless venture as early as next week,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  Sprint is preparing to take the step as LightSquared
approaches a March 15 deadline to meet certain conditions under
the agreement, said the people, who wouldn’t be identified
because the information isn’t public. Sprint and LightSquared
struck an 11-year deal to share network expansion costs and
equipment in June provided LightSquared secure regulatory
approvals for its wireless service by December. Though Sprint
pushed the deadline back, it doesn’t plan more extensions, the
people said.  The loss of Sprint would fuel concerns about the viability
of LightSquared and mark another setback for Falcone. The hedge
fund manager has invested about $3 billion from his Harbinger
Capital Partners in LightSquared in an effort to create a
national wireless carrier to compete against  AT&T Inc. (T)  and
 Verizon Wireless . Harbinger managed about $4 billion at the end
of last year, down from a peak of $26 billion in mid-2008.  Terry Neal , a LightSquared spokesman, and  Scott Sloat , a
Sprint spokesman, declined to comment. Lew Phelps, a spokesman
for Falcone, said he had no comment.  Sprint rose 1.7 percent to $2.43 at the close in  New York .
Another Sprint network partner, wholesale carrier  Clearwire
Corp. (CLWR) , climbed 4.8 percent to $2.18.  FCC Decision  Under their agreement last year,  Overland Park , Kansas-
based Sprint was to build and operate LightSquared’s network for
11 years in exchange for $9 billion in payments and an
additional $4.5 billion in service credits. Sprint extended the
deal’s deadline as the Federal Communications Commission
considered whether to allow LightSquared to convert airwaves
originally designated for satellite service for communication
with land-based, or terrestrial, radio towers.  The FCC said last month it would block LightSquared’s
planned network because of potential disruptions to global-
positioning systems. The company said after the decision that it
remains committed to finding a solution to the concerns.  In the wake of that decision, Chief Executive Officer
 Sanjiv Ahuja  resigned and Falcone was appointed to the board as
the company began a search for a new CEO. The company also cut
45 percent of its 330-member staff to preserve cash.  Nokia Siemens Networks, the wireless-equipment venture of
Finland’s  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  and  Germany ’s  Siemens AG (SIE) , today said it
stopped work in 2011 on the network it was building for
LightSquared.  Skipped Payment  “While we have a contract with LightSquared, they
previously asked us to put our activities related to the network
build on hold while they resolve” issues concerning the global-
positioning technology, a Nokia Siemens spokesman, Ben Roome,
said by e-mail. LightSquared originally planned to spend $7
billion over eight years on the network, it said in July 2010.  LightSquared, based in Reston, Virginia, has paid Sprint
$310 million in advanced payments for work on the network and
its eventual operation. Sprint said in a securities filing last
month that it would keep about $236 million of those payments
and return as much as $74 million if the agreement was
terminated after the March 15 deadline. If LightSquared’s
lenders approve changes to the agreement, Sprint’s right to
terminate will be deferred until June 25, according to the
filing.  Effect on Clearwire  Clearwire may benefit if Sprint’s relationship with
LightSquared ends. With LightSquared out of the picture, Sprint
would have to rely on Clearwire’s network to meet its users’
bandwidth demands,  Jennifer Fritzsche , a senior analyst at Wells
Fargo Securities, said in a note today.  “We believe this news is very much expected and should not
be seen as an additional negative surprise for Sprint shares,”
Fritzsche said in the note.  A Clearwire spokeswoman,  Susan Johnston , declined to
comment.  Last month, LightSquared skipped a $56.3 million payment to
its partner  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT) , a British satellite operator, saying
the work promised hadn’t been finished.  Falcone told Harbinger investors in February that
LightSquared is still exploring remedies like signal-filtering
technology and a possible swap of frequencies with the military.
As of the end of January, Falcone carried his investment in
LightSquared’s equity at $1.5 billion, or about half of what his
hedge fund had invested to date, according to a Harbinger
document.  The company has also hired Moelis & Co. and other advisers
to help study alternatives.  To contact the reporters on this story:
