Iraqi Construction and Housing
Minister Mohammad Saheb al-Darraji escaped unharmed when a car
bomb exploded near his convoy in  Baghdad  today, injuring six of
his bodyguards, the ministry said.  Two vehicles from the minister’s convoy were burned by the
explosion in the western part of the Iraqi capital, the ministry
said in an emailed statement.  The violence adds to concern that the U.S. troop withdrawal
at the end of last year has left a security vacuum in  Iraq  as it
seeks investment and expertise to develop the world’s fifth-
largest crude oil reserves. Bombings have surged amid renewed
political disputes, mostly between Shiite Muslim Prime Minister
Nouri al-Maliki’s coalition and opponents from the Sunni Muslim-
backed Iraqiya alliance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
