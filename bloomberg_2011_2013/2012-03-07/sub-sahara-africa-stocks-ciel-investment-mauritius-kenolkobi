interests in leisure and property, rose 3.9 percent to 2.7
rupees, the biggest gain since October 2010. Ciel Investment is
an associate company of Deep River Investment Ltd., which said
yesterday it has received an offer from a “prospective
bidder.”  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK)  , Kenya’s biggest lender by
customers, gained for a fourth day, rising 1 percent to close at
19.6 shillings, the strongest since Nov. 16, as investors bet
earnings will continue to increase.  “The earnings up to quarter three have surpassed the full
year for 2010,” Francis Mwangi, head of research at Nairobi-
based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in an interview in
Nairobi today. “My estimate is that earnings per share will
grow 31 percent because up to the third quarter there was
increased lending compared to 2010 and there is continued growth
in fees and commissions income.”  KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC)  , a Kenyan fuel retailer with
operations in nine African countries, advanced for a third day,
increasing 1.4 percent to 11.2 shillings, the biggest rise since
Feb. 28. The Nairobi-based company said it will continue
expanding its operations on the continent and will revamp its
Lubumbashi terminal in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Presco Plc (PRESCO)  , Nigeria’s second-largest producer
of palm-oil products by market value, jumped 4.9 percent to 8.93
naira, the biggest one-day rise since Jan. 30, as investors bet
it will pay a dividend for fiscal 2011.  “Investors are taking the position that it will pay a good
dividend for 2011,” David Adonri, chief executive officer of
Lambeth Trust & Investment Co., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by
phone today. Presco paid a dividend of 1 naira per share last
year, and “if it maintains that rate this year at the current
price, the yield will be very competitive,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
