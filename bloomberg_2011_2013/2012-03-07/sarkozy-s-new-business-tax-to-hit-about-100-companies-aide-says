A new business tax French President
 Nicolas Sarkozy  announced yesterday will affect about 100
businesses and not just the companies in the benchmark  CAC 40 (CAC) 
index he initially implied, his spokeswoman said.  Sarkozy, who faces re-election in April, announced on a
television talk show that he’ll create a new levy to ensure
large French companies pay a minimum amount of tax.  His spokeswoman, Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet said at a press
conference in Paris today that the tax would apply to any
company headquartered in  France  with a capitalization of more
than 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion).  She said only about half the members of the CAC 40 pay any
income tax in France because of various loopholes and foreign
tax treaties, and that those that do pay contribute a total of
between 3 billion euros and 4 billion euros a year to the
country’s tax revenue. She didn’t have those statistics for all
100 companies that could be affected.  The goal of the new tax is to raise an additional 2 billion
euros to 3 billion euros a year.  “Working on the  tax rate  doesn’t do any good; it’s working
on the tax base that matters,” Kosciusko-Morizet said.  The tax will initially be levied on worldwide revenue. Once
the necessary treaties with other countries are in place, it
will be levied on worldwide profit, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
