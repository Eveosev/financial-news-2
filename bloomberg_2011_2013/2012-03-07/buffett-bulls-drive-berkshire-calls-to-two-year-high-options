Warren Buffett ’s signals that shares
of his  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  are undervalued have sent bullish
options to the highest levels in two years.  The number of outstanding  call  options to buy Berkshire’s
Class B shares versus puts to sell rose to 1.26-to-1 on March 5
after reaching 1.31 on Feb. 10, the highest level since February
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The cost of puts
protecting against a 10 percent drop fell to the lowest level
since May relative to calls betting on a 10 percent gain, data
on 30-day contracts show.  Buffett, 81, the world’s most-successful investor and
third-richest person in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said
he plans to repurchase stock “aggressively” when Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire trades at less than 1.1 times net
assets. The company has lagged behind the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index since last year’s low in October.  “It’s a bona fide bargain,”  Todd Lowenstein , who helps
oversee about $17 billion for Highmark Capital Management Inc.
in  Los Angeles , said in a telephone interview yesterday. Buffett
wants “to let investors know that he’s got a bazooka out there
and can go out and buy the stock,” he said.  Buffett, who transformed Berkshire from a failing textile
manufacturer in 1965 into an insurance-and-investment firm
valued at $194.5 billion, didn’t return a message seeking
comment on the options trading.  First Buyback  Berkshire’s chairman and chief executive officer announced
the repurchase program, the company’s first, in September. The
stock, which has  traded  at an average multiple to book value of
1.5 over the last decade, surged after the Sept. 26 repurchase
announcement, curbing the company’s opportunity to buy. As of
Dec. 31, Berkshire had spent $67 million.  While the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has  added  22 percent
since its one-year low on Oct. 3, Berkshire’s Class B stock has
gained 12 percent. Insurance companies in the gauge advanced 23
percent, and S&P 500 financial shares jumped 28 percent.  Buffett said on Feb. 25 in his  annual letter  to
shareholders he intends to “repurchase stock aggressively” at
or below 1.1 times book, while refraining from buybacks if
Berkshire’s cash slips below $20 billion. Berkshire’s Class A
shares trade for 1.18 times the company’s per-share book value
of $99,860. Those shares have risen 2.7 percent to $117,855 this
year. The Class B shares closed at $78.47 yesterday.  The company, which had $37.3 billion of cash on Dec. 31,
can “clearly increase” its value by repurchasing shares at the
right price, Buffett said in his letter to shareholders. Still,
Buffett told investors not to rely on repurchases to provide a
floor for the shares.  ‘Bids Will Fade’  “You should know, however, that we have no interest in
supporting the stock and that our bids will fade in particularly
weak markets,” Buffett wrote.  The company’s Class A stock is probably worth $178,366,
hedge-fund manager  Whitney Tilson  said in a Feb. 26
presentation. That was 49 percent more than the last closing
price for the shares.  Buffett “would love to be able to buy back 10 to 20
percent of total shares,” Tilson, who has owned Berkshire stock
for 14 years and oversees $150 million as managing director at
New York-based T2 Partners LLC, said yesterday in a phone
interview. “He has the balance sheet and the  cash flow .”  Ownership of bullish Berkshire contracts  increased  23
percent to 202,502 on March 5 from the last monthly options
expiration on Feb. 17, while put open interest gained 20 percent
to 160,942, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Implied Volatility  Implied volatility , the key gauge of options prices, for
30-day contracts closest to Berkshire’s stock price dropped 64
percent since its Aug. 8 high to 16.5 yesterday. Implied
volatility for contracts 10 percent below the stock price was
22.25, while the measure for options 10 percent above was 15.99,
driving the price relationship known as skew to a nine-month low
of 6.26 points.  “In the past month, option traders are increasingly
expressing bullish views in Berkshire’s B shares,” Terry Wilson, an equity derivatives strategist at Credit Suisse Group
AG in  New York , said in an e-mail yesterday.  Buffett said last month the board has picked his eventual
replacement without identifying the choice, saying that
directors were “enthusiastic” and have had “a great deal of
exposure” to the person designated to take over as CEO.
Berkshire, which relies on Buffett to oversee a $77 billion
stock portfolio and operating units with more than 270,000
workers, didn’t specify a timeline for the switch.  ‘There’s Risk’  “There is risk to the stock price when a succession takes
place,” said  Tim Ghriskey , who oversees $2 billion as chief
investment officer of Solaris Group in  Bedford Hills , New York.
“At some point that could be an opportunity, but right now
there’s risk.”  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the  VIX (VIX) , rose 16 percent, the most since Nov. 9, to 20.87
yesterday. Since reaching a two-year high on Aug. 8, it  lost 57
percent  through yesterday. It fell 8.6 percent to 19.07 today.  Since the last options expiration on Feb. 17, four of the
five contracts with the biggest increases in ownership were
calls, data compiled by Bloomberg show. March $82.50 calls,
priced 5.1 percent above yesterday’s close for the Class B
stock, gained the most, adding 10,910 options to 21,386. Those
also had the  biggest  open interest among Berkshire contracts.  Berkshire’s holdings range from shares of  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  and
International Business Machines Corp. to units in the railroad,
electric utility, homebuilding and candymaking industries.  “Cheapness is a catalyst” for the stock to rise, Tilson
said. Berkshire is “a collection of fabulous operating
businesses.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
