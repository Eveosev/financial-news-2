Jeronimo Martins SGPS SA (JMT) ,  Portugal ’s
biggest retailer by market value, said full-year profit rose 21
percent, less than analysts expected  Net income gained to 340 million euros ($446 million) in
2011, Lisbon-based Jeronimo Martins said today in a regulatory
filing. That missed the 363.5 million-euro average of 10
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  A weak economy in Portugal, where Jeronimo Martins owns the
Pingo Doce hypermarket and Recheio wholesale brands, has
prompted the rerailer to focus its investments in Poland, where
its Biedronka chain is the biggest discount grocer, and
 Colombia , its third market.  Jeronimo Martins fell as much as 4.1 percent in Lisbon
trading. The stock declined as much as 56 cents to 13.05 euros,
and traded at 13.175 euros at 8:20 a.m. in the Portuguese
capital.  Sales increased 13 percent to 9.8 billion euros in 2011.
The board will propose increasing the gross dividend 31 percent
to 27.5 cents a share.  “We expect 2012 to be another good year, driven by the
strong growth of Biedronka in  Poland ,” the company said. “In
Portugal our main targets are to increase market share whilst
trying to protect profitability.”  The Biedronka unit will open about 250 new stores in 2012,
Jeronimo Martins said. The company plans to invest about 650
million euros in 2012, of which 80 percent will be invested in
Biedronka.  Polish Expansion  Jeronimo Martins said on Nov. 2 it will invest 2.2 billion
euros between 2012 and 2014 as its Polish unit expands and
operations begin in Colombia this year. The retailer will spend
400 million euros in Colombia in that period and increase its
Biedronka chain in Poland to 3,000 stores in 2015.  “In Colombia, we are optimizing our plans to start
operations in the country,” Jeronimo Martins said, without
providing details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
