Ciena Corp. (CIEN) , a maker of network
equipment for phone companies, gained the most in a month after
forecasting fiscal second-quarter revenue that topped some
analysts’ estimates.  The shares rose 4.2 percent to $14.01 at the close in New
York, after Ciena made the forecast in a statement today
reporting first-quarter earnings. That was the biggest increase
since Feb. 3. The Linthicum, Maryland-based company’s stock has
advanced 16 percent this year.  Ciena, which last month said first-quarter results would
suffer from delays in recording international sales, today
predicted stronger operating results in the second half of the
year. That gives investors more confidence that Ciena’s
 customers , which include  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , are
spending more than expected in 2012, said Blair King, an analyst
with Avondale Partners LLC in Nashville,  Tennessee .  “This is one of the first signs that order flows are
actually pretty good right now,” said King, who has a “market
outperform”  rating  on Ciena. “Once the projects get recognized
in the revenue it sets up a steady state of consistent business
that leads to a steadier top-line prospect heading into 2013,”
King said in a telephone interview.  The company forecast sales for the period ending April 30
in a range of $435 million to $460 million, according to a
statement today. That compared to a $451.5 million average
estimate from 19 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Ciena reported $416.7 million in revenue for the fiscal
first quarter ended Jan. 31, compared with $433.3 million a year
earlier. Analysts had  estimated  $426.3 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
