Gulf Coast gasoline rose after
 Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  reported emissions from a catalytic cracker
and other equipment at the McKee refinery in  Texas .  A unit trip and low temperatures on an electrostatic
precipitator during a restart caused the emissions yesterday,
according to a  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental
Quality.  The discount for reformulated 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the  Gulf Coast (MOSGR87P)  narrowed 1.5 cents to 23.5 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
11:59 a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 5.56 cents to $3.0355 a gallon.  The alkylation unit at the Citgo Corpus Christi East plant
remains offline while the cause of a leak on March 5 is under
investigation, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
