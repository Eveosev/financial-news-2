Sugar output in  Mexico , the world’s
sixth-largest producer, fell 14 percent to far this season,
according to industry committee Conadesuca.  Production in the 2011-12 season, which started in October,
totaled 2.7 million metric tons through March 3, Conadesuca said
in a report on its  website  yesterday. That compares with 3.1
million tons in the same period in 2010-11.  Mexico will produce 5.1 million tons of sugar this season,
down from a previous forecast of 5.3 million tons, Conadesuca
said on Feb. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
