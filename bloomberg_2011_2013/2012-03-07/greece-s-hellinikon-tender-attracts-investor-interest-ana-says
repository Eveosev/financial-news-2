There is significant investor
interest in a majority stake in a project to develop  Greece ’s
Hellinikon airport site,  Athens  News Agency reported, citing the
Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund’s head, Costas Mitropoulos.  Joint ventures are expected to be among bidders, who must
submit initial interest by March 30, Mitropoulos told a
committee in parliament in Athens today, according to ANA. To
qualify to proceed to the tender’s second phase, bidders will
have to submit a master plan, have holdings of at least 350
million euros ($458 million) and provide a letter of guarantee
from a bank, ANA cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
