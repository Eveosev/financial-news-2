Enel Green Power SpA (EGPW) ’s spending on
Romanian wind farms rose more than fourfold to 330 million euros
($434 million) last year as the country seeks to increase
production of electricity from renewable sources.  The company, Italy’s largest renewable-energy company and a
unit of Enel SpA, began operating 205 megawatts of Romanian wind
farms in 2011, the most of any European country, it said. Enel
commissioned 91 megawatts in Italy and 64 megawatts in France,
it said. The company spent 75 million euros in  Romania  in 2010.  Enel Green Power and companies such as  CEZ AS (CEZ)  and  Iberdrola
SA (IBE)  are investing in Romania because of government incentives for
renewable energy. The nation approved a plan to spur investment
by granting tradable green certificates for each megawatt-hour
of renewable energy produced. Wind gets two per megawatt-hour.  Enel Green Power, based in  Rome , spent 36 million euros to
build wind farms in  Greece  last year and 56 million euros in
France, up from 40 million euros a year earlier, according to a
2011 results statement yesterday. The company started operating
the Corugea and Moldova Noua wind parks in Romania in December.  Romania is seeking to increase wind power capacity to 1,400
megawatts by the end of the year from the current 800 megawatts,
Environment Minister Laszlo Borbely said in February.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
