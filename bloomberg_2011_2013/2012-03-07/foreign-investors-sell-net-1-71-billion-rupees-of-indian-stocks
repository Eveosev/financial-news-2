Overseas  investors  sold a net  1.71
billion rupees  ($34.3 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
paring their investments in the equities this year to 371.2
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 26.3 billion rupees of shares and sold 28
billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India  said on
its  website  today. They poured 252.1 billion rupees in February,
helping the BSE India Sensitive Index to its second straight
monthly gain for the first time since September 2010.  Overseas investors sold a net 4.41 billion rupees of bonds,
reducing their inflow into debt this year to 256.4 billion
rupees, the data  show . They put 421 billion rupees in bonds in
2011.  Foreigners have invested 4.815 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.464 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows from abroad surged
to a record in 2010, making the  Sensex (SENSEX)  the best performer among
the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led
to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the Sensex, the second worst annual
loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
