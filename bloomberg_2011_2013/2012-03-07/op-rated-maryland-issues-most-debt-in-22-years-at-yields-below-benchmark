Maryland (STOMD1) , one of eight states with
top general-obligation ratings from both  Standard & Poor’s  and
Moody’s Investors Service, sold about $680 million of bonds as
it capped its biggest issue in at least 22 years.  About $544 million of the proceeds from the tax-exempt
securities will go toward capital projects and the rest will
retire debt, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch won the competitive bids for both series
today.  A 15-year portion was priced to yield 3.05 percent,
preliminary data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s five basis
points below an  index  of AAA rated general obligations with a
similar maturity. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Maryland  sold about $57 million in a negotiated sale on
March 5. The $737 million total issuance this week is the
state’s biggest since at least 1990, when Bloomberg data begin.
The state’s previous high was when it sold about $656 million in
March 2005, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
