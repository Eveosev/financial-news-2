Mediaset SpA (MS) , Italy’s biggest
private broadcaster, may have to reduce staff if the Italian
economy continues to lag behind that of Europe, forcing the
company to cut costs, Chairman Fedele Confalonieri said.  The size of Italy’s advertising market last year was
similar in real terms as it was in 2002, Confalonieri told a
parliamentary committee in  Rome  today.  “If there aren’t signs of a recovery, cutting our billions
in investment and our 2 billion euros in costs becomes
indispensable,” he said. “For brevity’s sake, I don’t want to
go into the obvious consequences that such action would have on
employment levels.”  Confalonieri said that the government’s commitment to
European Union allies to balance the budget next year would
weigh on economic growth and “a medium term strategy that also
focused on development” is needed.  Mediaset’s biggest shareholder is Fininvest SpA, the
company owned by  Silvio Berlusconi ’s family.  To contact the reporter on this story:
