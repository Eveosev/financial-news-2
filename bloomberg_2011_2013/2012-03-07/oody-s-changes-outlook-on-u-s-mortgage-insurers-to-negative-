Moody’s Investors Service changed
its outlook on U.S. mortgage insurers to “negative” from
“developing” as homeowner defaults drain capital and property
values remain little changed.  “The outlook change reflects mortgage insurers’ continued
weak performance, including their stressed capital positions and
continued material uncertainty about the ultimate magnitude of
losses related to the financial crisis,” Stanislas Rouyer, an
associate managing director for the ratings firm, said in a
statement today. Moody’s didn’t name specific companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
