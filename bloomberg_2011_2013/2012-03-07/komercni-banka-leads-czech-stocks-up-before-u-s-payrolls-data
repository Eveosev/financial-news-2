Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , a unit of Societe
Generale SA, led Czech stocks higher as investors awaited a
private report that may show American payrolls increased.  The stock climbed for a second day, rising 1.8 percent to
3,720 koruna by 10:40 a.m. in Prague. The 14-member PX index,
where Komercni has a 17 percent weighting, added 0.6 percent.
Austria’s  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  climbed 1 percent to 453.8 koruna.  Banks were among the biggest gainers in  Europe  today before
data from the ADP Employer Services which may show companies in
the world’s largest economy added 215,000 workers in February,
compared with 170,000 in January, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of economists.  To contact the reporter on this story:
