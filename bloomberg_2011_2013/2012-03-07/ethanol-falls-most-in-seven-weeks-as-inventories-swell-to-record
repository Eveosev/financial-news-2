Ethanol futures in  Chicago  fell the
most in more than seven weeks after a government report showed
stockpiles grew for a 12th week.  Prices tumbled 1.9 percent after the Energy Department said
ethanol  inventories  reached a record 22.1 million barrels while
production of  conventional gasoline mixed with the biofuel 
decreased 2.7 percent to 5.1 million barrels a day.  “They’re tucking it away on any tank they can find,” said
Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa . “You’re not going to see a change or people get excited
about ethanol until you start seeing stocks dwindle.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery 4.3 cents to $2.248 a
gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, the steepest decline since
Jan. 12. Prices have gained 2 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf decreased
2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.315 a gallon and on the West
Coast the biofuel fell 2 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $2.365,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slipped 0.5 cent to $2.245 a gallon and
in  New York  the additive sank 0.5 cent to $2.29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
