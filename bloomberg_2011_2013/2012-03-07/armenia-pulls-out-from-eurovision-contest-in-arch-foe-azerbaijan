Armenia  withdrew from the Eurovision
Song Contest, the world’s most-watched singing competition,
that’s scheduled to be held in May in Baku, the capital of arch-
foe Azerbaijan, the organizers said.  “Despite the efforts of the European Broadcasting Union
and the host broadcaster to ensure a smooth participation for
the Armenian delegation in this year’s contest, circumstances
beyond our control led to this unfortunate decision,” Jan Ola
Sand, the executive supervisor of the competition, said on the
official Eurovision  website  today.  The Caspian Sea nation gained the right to host the event
by winning first place at the festival in Dusseldorf last year.
Oil-rich Azerbaijan fought a war with Armenia over Nagorno-
Karabakh, a majority Armenian-populated enclave that broke free
from Baku’s control following the disintegration of the  Soviet
Union  in 1991.  The territory remains a potential flash point in a region
where  Russia  fought a five-day war with Georgia in 2008 after
separatist tensions flared up over the breakaway regions of
Abkhazia and South Ossetia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
