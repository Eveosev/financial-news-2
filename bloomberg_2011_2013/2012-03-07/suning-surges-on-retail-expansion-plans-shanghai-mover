Suning Appliance Co. (002024) ,  China ’s
biggest electronics retailer by market value, climbed the most
in almost three years after its chairman said it will expand the
range of products it sells beyond appliances.  Suning  rose  8.6 percent to 10.10 yuan at the close in
Shenzhen, the most since April 20, 2009. China’s benchmark
Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.7 percent.  The Jiangsu province-based retailer plans to expand both
online and to add physical stores and has started selling books,
daily necessities and other products in addition to electronics,
chairman Zhang Jindong was cited as saying by  Sina.com . Zhang
said he wants to transform Suning into a company that combines
the strengths of  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  and  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the
news website reported yesterday.  “There’s likely a huge market potential in Suning’s
expansion of its product line” which will give the company
another source of revenue, Ouyang Jinjuan, an analyst at Wanlian
Securities in Shanghai, said by telephone today. Ouyang
recommends investors buy the shares.  Suning targets reaching 30 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) of
online sales this year and will add five major procurement and
sales centers to support its web effort, Zhang told  China Daily 
yesterday. The company also aims to capture 20 percent of
China’s home appliance market by 2020 when it is expected to
grow to 3.1 trillion yuan, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
