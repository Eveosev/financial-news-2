Carbon Motors Corp. said it won’t
get a U.S. Energy Department loan it applied for to develop more
fuel-efficient police cars.  The Connersville, Indiana-based company said today it had
asked for $310 million in financing from the Advanced Technology
Vehicle Manufacturing program, which last week declined to give
Bright Automotive Inc. a loan to develop electric commercial
vans.  The program is one of three Energy Department lending
programs drawing scrutiny since last year’s bankruptcy of solar-
panel maker Solyndra LLC, a recipient of U.S. loan guarantees.  “We are outraged by the actions of the DOE and it is clear
that this was a political decision in a highly-charged,
election-year environment,” Carbon Motors Chief Executive
Officer William Santana Li said in a statement on the company’s
website.  At least 14 members of Congress, including Senator  Richard Lugar , an Indiana Republican, wrote to the Energy Department in
support of Carbon Motors’s application, according to letters
provided by the agency.  “Over the last two and a half years, the department has
worked with Carbon Motors to try to negotiate a deal that
supported their business while protecting the taxpayers,”
 Damien LaVera , an Energy Department spokesman, said in an e-
mail. “While we were not able to come to an agreement on terms
that would protect the taxpayers, we continue to believe that
Carbon Motors is an innovative company with an interesting
project and we wish them luck.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
