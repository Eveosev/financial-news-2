MTN Group Ltd. (MTN) ,  Africa ’s largest
mobile-phone operator, plans to boost capital expenditure 38
percent this year after growth in subscriber numbers and
currency shifts boosted 2011 earnings.  The company will spend 24.4 billion rand ($3.2 billion)
this year to strengthen data services in all 22 markets in which
it operates in Africa and the Middle East, Johannesburg-based
MTN said today in a statement. The company said it will increase
capacity in its largest markets of  Nigeria ,  Iran  and South
Africa by building third-generation towers and base stations to
handle more data traffic.  MTN’s customer numbers rose 16 percent to 164.5 million
last year. It forecast 4 million additional subscribers each in
Nigeria and Iran in 2012, while  South Africa  will probably add
2.9 million users this year, the company said, boosting the
total number of its clients by 20.3 million, MTN said.  MTN  rose  3 percent to 139.20 rand at the close in
Johannesburg, the highest price since Jan. 4. The company
increased its dividend payout ratio to 70 percent and will
continue buying back shares after spending 927.3 million rand on
stock purchases in 2011, MTN said.  ‘Attracting Attention’  “This is the kind of situation that is attracting
attention as investors are looking for solid companies with
yield and good dividend prospects,”  Ferdi Heyneke , a trader at
Afrifocus Securities, said by telephone today. “Operationally,
MTN is doing very well.”  Adjusted earnings per share jumped to 10.70 rand from 7.47
rand a year earlier, MTN said. That missed the 10.83 rand median
 estimate  of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  MTN will focus its mergers and acquisition strategy on
Africa and the  Middle East  and continue to look for “bolt-on”
purchases that will make it the number one or two operator in a
country, Chief Executive Officer Sifiso Dabengwa said at a
presentation. There are limited opportunities for
“transformational” deals that will change the company’s
profile, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
