Oil rose from a two-week low as more
investors signed on to a Greek debt swap, reducing concern that
the country will default and bolstering optimism that the
European economy will rebound.  Futures climbed 1.4 percent after investors with holdings
amounting to 58 percent of the Greek bonds eligible for the
nation’s debt swap agreed to participate. An Energy Department
report showed that U.S. crude supplies increased last week while
stockpiles of gasoline, diesel and heating oil fell.  “Markets are creeping higher because it looks like Greece
is at the threshold of a debt deal,” said  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy. “A Greek default would have been an
incredibly disruptive event. We’re now seeing a rebound in
sentiment and hopes that the economy will grow going forward.”  Crude oil for April delivery rose $1.46 to settle at
$106.16 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are
up 7.4 percent this year.  Brent oil for April settlement increased $2.14, or 1.8
percent, to end the session at $124.12 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract’s  premium  to New York-traded West Texas intermediate
oil widened to $17.96, the most since Feb. 10. The spread
reached a record $27.88 on Oct. 14.  The European sovereign debt crisis that began in  Greece  and
then moved to Ireland,  Portugal ,  Italy  and  Spain  has reduced
economic growth.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up 0.8 percent at 3:38
p.m. in New York. The euro gained 0.3 percent against the
dollar. A stronger common currency and weaker dollar bolster the
appeal of raw materials as an investment alternative.  Employment Growth  Companies in the U.S. added 216,000 workers to their
payrolls in February, according to data today from Roseland, New
Jersey-based ADP Employer Services. The median projection of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for an increase of
215,000. ADP reported a revised 173,000 increase in January.  U.S. employers are poised to boost jobs as confidence in
the economy climbed to the highest level in a year, a quarterly
survey of chief financial officers showed today. A gauge of
executives’ optimism in the world’s largest economy rose to 59.2
from January through March from 53.3 the prior period, according
to a report issued today by Duke University/CFO Magazine.  The U.S. was the world’s biggest oil-consuming country in
2010, responsible for 21 percent of global oil use, according to
 BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy, released on June 8.
The European Union’s 27 members accounted for 16 percent of
world demand in 2010, BP figures show.  “The global economy is still at risk,” said David McAlvany, chief executive officer of McAlvany Financial Group in
Durango,  Colorado . “The market is sensitive to any external
catalyst at this point.”  U.S. Stockpiles  Crude supplies climbed 832,000 barrels to 345.7 million
barrels last week, the highest level since September, the Energy
Department report showed. Stockpiles at  Cushing, Oklahoma (DOESCROK) , the
delivery point for New York-traded futures, climbed 2.37 million
barrels to 36.2 million, the biggest gain since December 2009.  Gasoline inventories  fell 396,000 barrels to 229.5 million
last week, the Energy Department said. Supplies of distillate
fuel, a category that includes heating oil and diesel, decreased
1.94 million barrels to 139.5 million.  “The statistics today were bearish on the face of it,
especially the big build at Cushing,” said  Addison Armstrong ,
director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford,
Connecticut. “Supplies didn’t rise as much as expected
nationwide though, and demand for crude and fuel remains poor.”  Total fuel demand fell an average 78,000 barrels a day to
18.2 million last week, the report showed. Consumption was down
7.6 percent from the same week a year earlier.  Iranian Tension  Oil has climbed this year on concern U.S. and European
sanctions aimed at stopping  Iran’s nuclear program  will lead to
military conflict. The European Union yesterday offered to
negotiate with Iran on behalf of  China , France,  Germany ,  Russia ,
the U.K. and the U.S., after President  Barack Obama  called for
more time to let diplomacy and sanctions solve the standoff.  Sanctions may be cutting Iranian oil exports as vessels
cancel trips to the country. Shipments have declined by 300,000
to 400,000 barrels a day because of the restrictions, Amrita Sen, an analyst at  Barclays Capital  in  London , said today by e-
mail. Half of the tankers booked to load at the country’s
largest terminal last month didn’t complete the voyages,
according to brokers, company officials and ship-tracking data.  “The market has been supported by a fear premium,” said
Todd Horwitz, chief strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in  New
York . “Once the situation calms down and the fear is
alleviated, prices will drop below $100.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 719,490
contracts as of 3:39 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 737,533
contracts yesterday, 19 percent above the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.58 million, the highest level since June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
