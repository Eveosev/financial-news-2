February as the economy showed signs of stabilizing.  The jobless rate, adjusted for seasonal swings, was at 3.1
percent, unchanged from January and in line with the median

Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern said in an e-mailed
statement today. Unemployment had been at 3.0 percent, the
lowest in more than two years, in the seven months through
November.  The  unadjusted jobless rate  also stayed the same at 3.4
percent, todayâ€™s report showed. The number of open jobs rose 932
to 18,403 last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
