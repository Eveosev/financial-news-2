Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won Idaho’s Republican presidential caucuses, Fox and
MSNBC projected.  Romney prevailed over Texas congressman  Ron Paul . Seeking
his first win in the Republican race, Paul focused on Idaho,
holding rallies there yesterday and today.  Idaho is a reliably Republican state that hasn’t backed a
Democrat for president since 1964. The state, one of 11 holding
contests today, has 32 delegates that will be divided up for the
 Republican National Convention .  To contact the reporter on this story:
