The  California Public Employees’
Retirement System , the largest U.S. public pension, may cut its
assumed rate of return on assets for the first time since the
global recession dragged down stock and real-estate prices.  Actuary Alan Milligan recommended trimming the annual
return estimate yesterday to 7.25 percent from 7.75 percent,
potentially driving up what the fund, known as Calpers, requires
from taxpayers to provide benefits for more than 1.6 million
employees, retirees and their families.  Public funds have come under fire for using investment
assumptions that hide the true size of shortfalls. The $238.1
billion fund last adjusted its rate of return in 2004, to 7.75
percent from 8.25 percent. The plan is to be considered by the
Calpers board next week.  Lowering  the return would boost the state’s employee
pension costs, as a percent of payroll, as much as 4.2 percent
in the year beginning July 1, according to a Calpers staff
report. Local governments could see an increase of as much as
4.5 percent the following year. The costs for some public-safety
agencies could jump as much as 6.5 percent.  The pension fund estimates that it has about 75 percent of
the money it needs to cover promised benefits. That differs from
a Stanford University  report  that said Calpers was only 58
percent funded, based on a 6.2 percent annual return on assets.  Equities Drop  The fund earned 1.1 percent in the calendar year that ended
Dec. 31 as global equities dropped, compared with a gain of 2.1
percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares
including reinvested dividends.  Calpers earned almost 5.1 percent over a decade and 7.5
percent in the past 20 years, according to  Joe Dear , the
system’s investment chief.  The board rejected a similar proposal by Milligan last
year. Board members at the time expressed concern that lowering
the rate to 7.5 percent would burden local governments when they
were already facing financial strains.  Milligan gave the board an option to cut the rate to that
same level this year, saying the economy continues to put
pressure on local governments.  The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, the
second-largest U.S. public pension with $148.9 billion of
assets, agreed Feb. 2 to lower its assumed returns to 7.5
percent from 7.75 percent, the second reduction since 2010.  The teacher’s fund had 71 percent of what it needs to pay
future benefits as of June 2010. The lower rate added $5.9
billion to a $56 billion shortfall projected at the time,
according to Milliman Inc., the fund’s consulting actuary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
