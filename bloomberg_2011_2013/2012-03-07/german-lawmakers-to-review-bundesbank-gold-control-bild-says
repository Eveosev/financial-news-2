German lawmakers will review the
Bundesbank’s management of the country’s gold reserves,  Bild
Zeitung  reported, citing unidentified parliamentarians.  Parliament’s Budget Committee will assess how the central
bank manages its inventory of the metal that is stored in
 Frankfurt , Paris,  London  and  New York , the newspaper said. The
Federal Audit Office has criticized the Bundesbank’s lax
inventory controls, Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
