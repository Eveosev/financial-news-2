Taxpayers who have been unemployed
for at least 30 days in 2011 or 2012 will be able to avoid some
penalties for failing to pay their taxes, the  Internal Revenue
Service  said.  Those struggling taxpayers would have an extra six months
to comply and avoid the failure-to-pay penalty. They would still
owe interest on back taxes, the IRS said today.  “This new approach makes sense for taxpayers and for the
nation’s tax system, and it’s part of a wider effort we have
under way to help struggling taxpayers,” IRS Commissioner
 Douglas Shulman  said in a statement.  The  new rules  apply to people who were unemployed for 30
consecutive days in 2011 or during the portion of 2012 before
the April 17 tax filing deadline.  The rules also apply to self-employed taxpayers whose
income declined 25 percent or more in 2011 because of the
economy. Married couples with income exceeding $200,000 and
individuals with income exceeding $100,000 don’t qualify, and
neither do people who owe more than $50,000 in taxes for 2011.  The IRS also is making it easier to pay back taxes through
installment agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
