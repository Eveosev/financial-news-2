from yesterday’s biggest drop since November, after a report

with more than half of Greek bonds agreed to a debt swap.  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  advanced 2.3 percent after UBS AG
recommended buying the stock.  Cobham Plc (COB)  jumped the most since

missed analyst estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed 0.6 percent to 260.10 at
the close in  London . The  benchmark gauge  retreated 2.7 percent
yesterday, the biggest drop since Nov. 21, and has still gained
6.4 percent so far this year.  “We don’t think yesterday’s move is the beginning of a
longer-term correction, so it rather presents a good opportunity
to add to positions,” Patrick Moonen, senior strategist at ING
Investment Management in  The Hague ,  Netherlands , said in a
telephone interview. “Overall, if you look at macro data,
surprises are still positive -- in the U.S. but also in the U.K.
and the euro zone.”  A report from ADP Employer Services showed companies in the

DAX climbed 0.6 percent and the U.K.’s FTSE 100 gained 0.4
percent.  Greek Debt Swap  Investors holding a total of at least 120 billion euros
($157 billion), or 58 percent of the Greek bonds eligible for
the nation’s debt swap, have so far indicated they will
participate in the biggest-ever sovereign restructuring. The
offer, which ends at 10 p.m. Athens time tomorrow, aims to
reduce the the 206 billion euros of privately held Greek debt by
53.5 percent.  Greece ’s largest banks, most of the country’s pension
funds, and more than 30 European banks and insurers including
BNP Paribas SA, Commerzbank AG and Assicurazioni Generali SpA
have pledged to accept the offer. The government said it will
use collective action clauses to force holders of Greek-law
bonds into the swap if necessary.  German factory orders unexpectedly declined in January.
Orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation, fell 2.7
percent from December, when they gained 1.6 percent, the Economy
Ministry in Berlin said. The median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg survey called for a 0.6 percent rise.  Deutsche Boerse, Cobham  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) , blocked from buying NYSE Euronext by

most since Sept. 16, after Bank of America Corp. said the
company’s shares are trading at “undemanding” price multiples.  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY)  rose 3.2 percent to 1,437 pence as  China
