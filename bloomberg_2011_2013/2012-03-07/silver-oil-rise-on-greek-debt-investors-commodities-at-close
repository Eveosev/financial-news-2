The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24  raw materials  climbed 0.7 percent to 697.62 as more
investors signed on to a Greek debt swap, bolstering optimism
that the European economy will rebound. Silver, crude oil and

to 1,613.191 at 5:09 p.m. in  New York .  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rebounded from a five-week low amid renewed optimism
that  Greece  will be able to tame its debt crisis and as a report
showed increased U.S. hiring.  Investors with holdings amounting to at least 58 percent of
the Greek bonds eligible for the nation’s debt swap have
indicated they’ll participate, moving the country closer to the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history. U.S. companies added
216,000 workers last month, according to data based on payrolls
from ADP Employer Services. Yesterday, gold declined to

to $3.2194 a gallon on the exchange. Prices are up 9.7 percent

from a five-month high on speculation that farmers took
advantage of last month’s rally by boosting sales to makers of
livestock feed, biofuel and food.  Before today, soybeans in Chicago jumped 15 percent since
Jan. 13, and corn gained 9.1 percent as hot, dry weather reduced
crop yields in  South America . Rain will aid crops in parts of

$13.2675 a bushel in Chicago, after reaching $13.39, the highest
level since Sept. 21.  Wheat futures tumbled the most since mid-January on
speculation that rains in the next week will improve the
condition of winter crops in the U.S. Great Plains as they
emerge from dormancy.  Parts of the Plains may receive as much as 0.75 inch (1.9
centimeters) of rain tomorrow, and storms over the weekend and
next week may bring additional moisture, World Weather Inc. said

level since Feb. 14.  In  London  futures trading, robusta coffee and cocoa rose,
while refined sugar retreated on NYSE Liffe.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures settled at a 10-year low in New York as
the fourth-warmest U.S. winter on record crimped demand for the
heating fuel while record production boosted stockpiles.  Gas, down 23 percent this year, is the worst performer on
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI commodity index. The lower 48 states
experienced the warmest weather from December through February
since 2000, according to the National Climatic Data Center. A
supply surplus at the end of February was the widest in almost
six years.  Natural gas for April delivery fell 5.4 cents, or 2.3

showed increased U.S. hiring and stockpiles of the metal

were at the lowest level since July 2009 today.  Prices have gained 9.6 percent this year as an improving
U.S. growth outlook signaled rising commodity demand.  Copper futures for May delivery climbed 0.8 percent to

signs that economic growth is cooling in  China , the world’s top
consumer.  On the LME, copper for three-month delivery advanced 0.1
percent to $8,295 a metric ton ($3.76 a pound).  Inventories tracked by the LME have slumped 24 percent this
year.  Also in London, nickel, zinc and lead increased, while
aluminum and tin retreated.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures rose for the first time this week on
speculation that U.S. shoppers will purchase pork instead of
costlier beef. Cattle prices dropped.  Wholesale-pork prices have dropped 7 percent in the past
year, while beef climbed 14 percent, government data show.  Hog futures for April settlement rose 0.7 percent to settle
at 87.35 cents a pound at 1 p.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
