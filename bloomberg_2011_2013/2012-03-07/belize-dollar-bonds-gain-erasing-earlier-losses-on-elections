Belize’s dollar bonds gained,
erasing earlier losses fueled by speculation a victory for the
ruling party in parliamentary elections today could lead it to
carry out a debt restructuring.  Yields on the country’s $544 million of bonds due 2029 fell
13 basis points to 18.98 percent after rising 12 basis points
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields are up from 17.35 on Feb. 6, the day  Standard &
Poor’s  carried out the first of two rating cuts on the Central
American country that has left it at CCC-, or three levels above
default. S&P said the incumbent United Democratic Party’s debt
restructuring talks have turned from “rhetoric to a promise.”
Yields touched a record 24.62 percent on Feb. 10.  The government is deciding whether it needs to restructure
the dollar bonds, Financial Secretary Joseph Waight said in a
Feb. 16 telephone interview. Phone calls to his office went
unanswered today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
