Colombia’s peso rose the most in
seven weeks, tracking gains in global markets, after a report
that showed American companies increased hiring boosted the
outlook for global growth and buoyed demand for higher-yielding
assets.  The peso climbed 0.7 percent to 1,768.80 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,780.68 yesterday. That’s the biggest increase since Jan.
18. It has advanced 8.7 percent in the past three months, the
best performance among emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  Companies in the world’s biggest economy added 216,000
workers last month, according to a private report by ADP
Employer Services. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey called for a 215,000 increase. The U.S. buys about 40
percent of Colombia’s exports, making it the South American
country’s top trading partner.  “The peso is following external markets today,” said
Lucia Duarte, a currency strategist at Bancolombia SA, the
nation’s biggest bank. “The ADP report is giving tranquility to
the market, which helps risk appetite.”  Dollar Purchases  The peso will likely continue trading this month within a
range of 1,767 and 1,791 as the central bank’s daily dollar
purchases reduce volatility in the  currency market , Duarte said.
She forecasts the peso will end this month at 1,783.  In a bid to ease gains in the peso, Banco de la Republica
said Feb. 24 it will extend a program of daily purchases of a
minimum of $20 million to at least Aug. 4, from the initially
announced minimum three-month period.  BNP Paribas SA closed out bets the peso will weaken toward
1,830 amid a “favorable” balance of payments outlook and
increased dollar holdings by local banks, strategists  Diego Donadio  and Thiago Alday wrote in a report today.  Increased dollar inflows as companies buy pesos to pay
local taxes may help push gains in the Colombian currency in
April, Donadio and Alday wrote. Policy makers may take further
measures to ease gains in the currency should it rise beyond
1,750, they wrote.  Yields on  Colombia ’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt due
in July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
7.22 percent, according to the central bank. The price rose
0.182 centavo to 122.1780 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
