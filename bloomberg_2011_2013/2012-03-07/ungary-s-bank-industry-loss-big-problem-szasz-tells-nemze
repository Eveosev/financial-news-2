The Hungarian banking industry’s
loss last year threatens lenders’ ability to manage risks in the
economy, Karoly Szasz, chairman of the financial market
authority, told daily  Magyar Nemze t.  “The banking sector must be profitable to ensure the
availability of capital that’s necessary for banks to manage
risks in a stable and secure manner,” Szasz told the Budapest-
based newspaper. “This has now come under threat.”  The capitalization of the industry would be “very
important” to boost  Hungary ’s regional competitiveness, Szasz
said, adding that banks’ liquidity was “appropriate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
