A plan to hire inspectors and
engineers by the U.S. offshore oil safety unit, created after
the  BP Plc (BP/)  spill two years ago, drew a rebuke from a Republican
lawmaker.  The  Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement  request
for a $24.8 million increase in 2013 spending led Representative
Mike Simpson, an Idaho Republican and head of the subcommittee
that oversees agency appropriations, today to question the
plans.  “How many inspectors are enough?” Simpson asked during a
hearing in Washington. “There will be no blank check coming
from this subcommittee. We expect results.”  The bureau was split off in October in the revamping of the
Interior Department’s oversight responsibilities following the
April 2010 BP disaster that killed 11 rig workers and spilled
4.9 million barrels of oil into the  Gulf of Mexico .  “We have increased the number of inspectors by 50 percent
since April 2010, and the number of engineers, who also perform
critical safety functions, by nearly 10 percent,” James Watson,
agency director, said during the hearing. “There are still a
considerable amount of positions yet to be filled, including
additional inspectors, engineers, regulatory specialists,
environmental specialists, and other critical disciplines.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
