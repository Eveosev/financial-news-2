Chile ’s direct investment abroad
reached $5.82 billion in 2011, the highest level since 1997, as
companies such as winemaker  Vina Concha y Toro SA  and industrial
group  Sigdo Koppers SA (SK)  expanded overseas.  Foreign investment leaped 27 percent from 2010, the Foreign
Relations Ministry said in a report posted on its website
yesterday. Peru led the investment destinations with $1.16
billion, followed by Uruguay and Colombia with $950 million and
$937 million respectively, the ministry  said .  Concha y Toro, which makes the Casillero del Diablo brand
of wine, last year completed its first U.S. acquisition, buying
California winery Fetzer Vineyards. Sigdo Koppers agreed to
purchase Belgium-based grinding products company Magotteaux SA,
Chile’s largest ever acquisition in the European Union, while
retailer  Empresas La Polar SA (LAPOLAR)  expanded in Colombia and  Empresas
Copec SA (COPEC)  invested in a pulp plant in Uruguay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
