Western Canada Select oil tumbled to
the weakest level since at least 2008 as crude supplies at
Cushing,  Oklahoma , swelled to the most in seven months.  Inventories (DOESCROK)  last week in Cushing, the largest U.S. storage
hub, increased 2.37 million barrels, or 7 percent, to 36.2
million barrels, the most since July 22, the Energy Department
reported today.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to U.S. benchmark West

 New York , the largest gap in Bloomberg records that go back to
May 2008.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS)  slipped $4.50 to $12.50 a barrel below WTI. The
discount for Bakken oil widened $2 to $21 a barrel, the largest
gap since Feb. 10.  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  resumed service late yesterday on its Line 14
in  Illinois . The line is one of two that was forced shut after
an accident March 3. The other pipe, Line 64, is scheduled to
