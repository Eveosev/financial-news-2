OAO OGK-3 jumped the most in almost
three months before the board of OAO Inter RAO UES, its biggest
owner, decides on a potential merger of generation assets.  The shares surged 10.2 percent to 1.2401 rubles as of 6:12
p.m. in Moscow, their biggest intraday gain since Dec. 14.  State-controlled Inter RAO plans to offer its own stock to
minority shareholders in the units, Interfax reported yesterday.  “We expect consolidation to be favorable to OGK-3 above
all, with potential upside of 5.6 percent,” Matvey Taits and
Ivan Rubinov, analysts at UralSib Financial Corp. wrote in a
note today. Inter RAO’s board is due to meet March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
