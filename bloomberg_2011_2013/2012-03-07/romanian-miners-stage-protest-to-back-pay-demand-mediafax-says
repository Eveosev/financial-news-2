Romanian coalminers demanding higher
pay and and better working conditions staged a protest at
Petrosani, in the southwest of the country,  Mediafax  said.  Two thousand miners marched to the headquarters of their
employer, state-owned Compania Nationala a Huilei SA; they say
the Economy Ministry hasnâ€™t respected an agreement with unions
to increase coal prices, employ younger people and raise wages,
the Bucharest-based news service said.  The ministry will negotiate with the miners, Deputy
Minister Karoly Borbely told reporters yesterday, adding that
resources for wage increases are limited.  To contact the reporter on this story:
