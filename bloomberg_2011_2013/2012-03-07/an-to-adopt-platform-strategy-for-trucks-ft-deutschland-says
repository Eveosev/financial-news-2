MAN SE (MAN) , a German truckmaker
controlled by  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , will adopt a “platform,” or
modular, strategy for trucks similar to the way VW builds
passenger cars, the  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
unidentified people close to the company.  The strategy is aimed at getting a head start over  Scania
AB (SCVB) , which may cooperate more closely with MAN once Leif Oestling, its chief executive officer, retires in 2015, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
