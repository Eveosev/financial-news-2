Jones Day (1113L) , the Washington-based law
firm, hired Barbara M. Harding, a former partner at  Kirkland &
Ellis LLP (1132L) , as the firm expands its mass-tort litigation
practice.  Harding, 48, has experience in litigation related to
asbestos liability, tobacco cost recovery and products
liability,  Jones Day  said in a statement. She previously served
as trial counsel for  W.R. Grace & Co. (GRA)  in its asbestos personal-
injury lawsuits in 2008, and represented the company in
 bankruptcy court  that year, the firm said.  “Her arrival here in Washington gives our defense teams
and clients around the country access to her vast experience
dealing with the scientific issues and experts that often play a
key role in high-stakes litigation,” Greg M. Shumaker, partner-
in-charge of the firm’s Washington office, said in the
statement.  Harding will join the firm as a partner in the business and
tort litigation practice in Washington.  Jones Day, which has more than 2,500 lawyers worldwide, was
ranked the seventh-highest-grossing law firm in 2010, with more
than $1.62 billion in revenue,  according  to the American Lawyer,
a trade magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
