Fidelity Investments , the second-
largest U.S. mutual fund company, said its operating income rose
13 percent last year as the average value of its equities under
management increased and the firm held costs in check.  Earnings climbed to $3.33 billion from $2.95 billion a year
earlier, the Boston-based asset manager said today in an e-
mailed statement. Revenue increased by 3.3 percent to $12.8
billion even as assets under management decreased by 4.5 percent
to $1.52 trillion.  “Against a backdrop of market volatility, Fidelity posted
solid results in 2011,” Edward C. Johnson III, chairman and
chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Fidelity, which lost the top spot among mutual fund
managers to  Valley Forge , Pennsylvania-based Vanguard Group Inc.
in 2010, said the growth in income was driven by higher equity
assets and by efforts to control spending. Stock funds typically
charge clients more than bond and money market funds.  Average equity assets increased 10 percent, according to
Fidelity. The mean value of the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  was
11 percent higher in 2011 than in 2010, even as the benchmark
for large U.S. stocks ended the year almost unchanged.  Fidelity’s expenses grew by less than 1 percent last year,
the firm said.  The amount of money investors withdrew from Fidelity funds
and other products fell to a net $36.3 billion from $49.4
billion in 2010. Clients pulled $46.1 billion from equity
products and $16.1 billion from money market products, the
company said.  Money Funds Suffer  Redemptions from Fidelity’s stock and bond mutual funds in
2011 totaled $28 billion, according to data compiled by fund
research firm  Morningstar Inc. (MORN)   Low  interest rates  and a shrunken supply of eligible
securities continued to hurt money market mutual funds in 2011.
Managers have lowered fees to keep customers’ returns above
zero. Fidelity is the largest manager of money market mutual
funds, with $419 billion in assets as of Jan. 31, according to
Crane Data LLC.  Closely held Fidelity didn’t report net income based on
generally accepted accounting principles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
