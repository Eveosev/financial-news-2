Mitt Romney , a former governor of
Massachusetts, won the Republican presidential primary in the
neighboring state of Vermont, Fox and CNN projected.  The networks projected Romney the winner soon after polls
closed in Vermont. None of his rivals in the Republican race
contested the state.  Vermont sends 17 delegates to the  Republican National
Convention  in August and, depending on his victory margin,
Romney might claim them all.  Vermont reported a 2 percent improvement in economic health
between the third quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2011,
best among northeastern states, according to the Bloomberg
Economic Evaluation of States.  To contact the reporter on this story:
