Mongolian Mining Corp. (975) , the
country’s biggest coking coal exporter, expects revenue to
continue rising this year because of demand from China.  “The trend will continue” after a surge in Chinese sales
last year, Executive Director Battsengel Gotov said in a
Bloomberg Television interview in  Hong Kong  today, without
giving an estimate.  Profit rose 98 percent to $119.1 million last year,
matching the average $118.7 million estimate of six analysts in
a survey compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 96 percent to
$542.6 million, the Hong Kong-listed company reported today.  The  shares  rose 4.2 percent to HK$7.39 as of 10:55 a.m.
local time, headed for the highest level since Sept. 28.
Mongolian Mining has fallen 24 percent in the past year,
compared with the 11 percent decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
