Apple Inc. (AAPL)  Chief Executive Officer
 Tim Cook  unveiled an updated version of the company’s Apple TV
set-top box with a new user interface.  At an event in San Francisco today, Cook said the Apple TV
device, which is plugged into a television, has a so-called
mirroring function so video from a user’s mobile devices can be
played on TV. Photos taken from an iPhone will wirelessly synch
using Apple TV, he said. The device goes on sale March 16 for
$99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
