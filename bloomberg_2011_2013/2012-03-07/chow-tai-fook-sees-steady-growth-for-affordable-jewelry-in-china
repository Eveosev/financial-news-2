Chow Tai Fook Jewelry Group Ltd. (1929) 
expects sales of its accessibly priced gold rings and bracelets
to continue to rise as it opens more than 500 stores in the next
four years in greater  China  even as economic growth slows.  “We’re still quite positive,” Alan Chan, the Hong Kong-
based jeweler’s director of group branding, said in an interview
in Paris. “Jewelry demand is growing steadily.”  China is targeting 7.5 percent economic expansion for 2012,
slower than an 8 percent goal in place since 2005, as  Europe ’s
debt crisis and a sluggish recovery in the U.S. hold back demand
for goods from the world’s largest exporter. Higher-end luxury-
sales growth in China has eased to as little as 15 percent from
70 percent as consumers switch to cheaper items,  Swatch Group AG (UHR) 
Chief Executive Officer Nick Hayek said March 1.  Chow Tai Fook, the world’s largest listed jewelry retailer,
gets more than 70 percent of sales from products in a price
range of HK$2,000 ($250) to HK$100,000, according to Chan. The
items “are things that the general public can afford, and we
are going after this segment,” he said.  More than half the  jeweler ’s sales come from gold products,
Chan said. The precious metal is “heavily tied in” to Chinese
culture and consumers buy it “for fortune, for transfer of
wealth to the next generation and gifting,” he said. “Demand
is very stable in that respect.”  Market Growth  China, the world’s second-largest gold jewelry market, may
boost retail consumption of the precious metal by 35 percent in
2012 to a record as incomes rise and urbanization continues,
according to researcher Frost & Sullivan. Chan spoke March 6 at
an event to promote Chinese fashion, art, dance, photography,
music and jewelry during Paris fashion week.  Chow Tai Fook, which has more than 1,500 watch and jewelry
outlets in 320 cities in China as well as in  Hong Kong  and
Macau, plans to open as many as 200 jewelry sales points a year
through 2015, Chan said. “We have at least 100 cities to go”
in the country, he said. The company aims to have more than
2,000 jewelry outlets by 2016.  The retailer’s 60 stores in Hong Kong account for about
one-third of sales, with half of those made to shoppers from
mainland China, Chan said. Chow Tai Fook will expand in third-
and fourth-tier cities as well as “go deeper” into large
metropolises as it opens more free-standing stores, he said.  “In  Shanghai , if we can match our sales in Hong Kong, it
would be a huge potential,” Chan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
