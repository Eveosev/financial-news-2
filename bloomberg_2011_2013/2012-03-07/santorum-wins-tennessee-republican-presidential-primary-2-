Former U.S. Senator  Rick Santorum  of
Pennsylvania won the Tennessee Republican presidential primary,
triumphing in a state with the third-biggest trove of convention
delegates in contests today.  The Associated Press projected Santorum as the winner,
finishing ahead of former former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia and
U.S. Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas.  “We went up against enormous odds,” Santorum said at a
rally in Steubenville, Ohio. “We overcame the odds.”  Santorum, Romney and Gingrich each campaigned in recent
weeks in Tennessee. The state’s 58 delegates are awarded
proportionally, based on the results statewide and in each
congressional district.  To contact the reporter on this story:
