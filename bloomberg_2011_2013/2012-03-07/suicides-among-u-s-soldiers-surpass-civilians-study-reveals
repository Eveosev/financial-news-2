U.S. Army suicides surpassed the
rate for similar civilians in 2008 after an 80 percent surge
during the five years following major troop deployments to Iraq
and  Afghanistan .  About 40 percent of the suicides in 2008 may be associated
with deployments to those countries, according to the report
published yesterday in the journal Injury Prevention. The U.S.
began committing troops in 2003. In 2008, the estimate of the
rate for active soldiers was higher than the rate for civilians
of similar age and sex.  The increase is “unprecedented in over 30 years of U.S.
Army records,” according to a statement by the  U.S. Army Public
Health Command , which focuses on promoting the health of
soldiers, military retirees and their families. The Army Medical
organization conducted the research.  As much as half of the suicides that occurred in 2008 may
have been related to the commitment of troops, according to the
report. Soldiers between the ages of 18 and 24 accounted for 45
percent of the deaths, and 54 percent were among personnel of
low rank. About two-thirds had been deployed in active combat.  “The recent increase in suicide rates may be viewed as the
tip of the ‘mental health iceberg,’ signaling more prevalent
underlying mental health problems,” Kathleen Bachynski of the
Health Command’s Injury Prevention Program in Aberdeen Proving
Ground,  Maryland , wrote in the study.  The Army has tried to prevent suicides in the past year
through training, a suicide prevention task force, and a day of
standing down from official duties to focus on suicide
prevention. Top military officials including former Defense
Secretary  Robert Gates  have encouraged military personnel to
seek counseling.  255 Deaths  The suicides began to rise after 2004, according to the
study. During 2007 and 2008, 255 active-duty soldiers killed
themselves, a rate of 20.2 per 100,000 person years. That
compares to an expected rate of 12 per 100,000 person years, the
study said.  Civilian rates adjusted to the gender structure of the U.S.
Army, including age and sex, were about 18 per 100,000 in 2008,
the study said.  The increase among soldiers tracked with a rise in mental-
health issues, and suicides were higher among those who had been
diagnosed with mental disorders in the preceding year, according
to the study.  Those admitted to a hospital for a mental-health disorder
were more than 15 times as likely to commit suicide as those who
hadn’t been. Hospital admissions for mental-health reasons rose
from 7.4 per 1,000 to 14 per 1,000 in 2008.  Diagnoses linked to a higher suicide risk included
depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress, substance
misuse, along with psychosis and adjustment disorders.  Those with major depression were more than 11 times as
likely to commit suicide, while those with anxiety disorders
were 10 times as likely.  To contact the reporter on this story:
