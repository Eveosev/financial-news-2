The following is the text of the
U.S. productivity and costs report for the fourth quarter
released by the Labor Department.  PRODUCTIVITY AND COSTS  Fourth Quarter and Annual Averages 2011, Revised  Nonfarm business sector labor productivity increased at a 0.9
percent annual rate during the fourth quarter of 2011, the
 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  reported today. The gain in
productivity reflects increases of 3.7 percent in output and
2.7 percent in hours worked. (All quarterly percent changes in
this release are seasonally adjusted annual rates.) From the
fourth quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2011,
productivity grew 0.3 percent, as output rose 2.3 percent and
hours rose 1.9 percent. Annual average productivity increased
0.4 percent from 2010 to 2011.  Labor productivity, or output per hour, is calculated by
dividing an index of real output by an index of hours worked
of all persons, including employees, proprietors, and unpaid
family workers. The measures released today were based on more
recent source data than were available for the preliminary
report.  Unit labor costs in nonfarm businesses increased 2.8 percent
in the fourth quarter of 2011, as productivity grew at a
slower rate (+0.9 percent) than hourly compensation (+3.7
percent). Unit labor costs rose 3.1 percent over the last four
quarters. Annual average unit labor costs increased 2.0
percent from 2010 to 2011.  BLS defines unit labor costs as the ratio of hourly
compensation to  labor productivity ; increases in hourly
compensation tend to increase unit labor costs and increases
in output per hour tend to reduce them.  --------------------------------------------------------------
Data in this release reflect the annual benchmark revision of
BLS Current Employment Statistics program data on nonfarm
employee hours, and revised seasonal adjustment of those data.
More detail can be found in tables 1 through 6 and appendix
tables 1 through 6. See Revised measures. --------------------
------------------------------------------  Manufacturing sector productivity edged down 0.1 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2011, as output rose 4.8 percent and
hours worked increased 4.9 percent; this is the largest
quarterly gain in hours worked since the second quarter of
1996 (6.2 percent). Over the last four quarters, manufacturing
productivity increased 1.7 percent. Annual average
productivity grew 2.6 percent from 2010 to 2011. Unit labor
costs in manufacturing increased 2.0 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2011 but were unchanged from the same quarter a
year ago.  The data sources and methods used in the preparation of the
manufacturing output series differ from those used in
preparing the business and nonfarm business output series, and
these measures are not directly comparable.  Revised measures  Quarterly and annual measures of hours and related series--
including productivity--for all sectors were revised back to
2007 to incorporate the annual benchmark adjustment and
updated information on seasonal trends from the BLS nonfarm
payroll series. Third quarter, fourth quarter, and annual
average data for 2011 were also revised for regular updates of
source data on output and compensation. Revised and previous
measures for the third and fourth quarters of 2011 are shown
in table B for the business, nonfarm business, and
manufacturing sectors. Revised annual average measures for
2007 to 2011 are shown in table C for the nonfarm business and
manufacturing sectors. Revised third quarter measures for the
nonfinancial corporate sector are shown in table D. Quarterly
and annual data for all sectors appear in tables 1-6 for 2009
through 2011, and in appendix tables 1-6 for 2007 and 2008.
Full historical annual and quarterly measures can be found on
the labor productivity and costs home page at
 http://www.bls.gov/lpc/#data .  In the fourth quarter of 2011, nonfarm business productivity
growth was 0.9 percent, reflecting an upward revision to
output combined with a downward revision to hours worked. Unit
labor costs rose 2.8 percent, due to an upward revision to
hourly compensation. Manufacturing productivity decreased less
than the preliminary estimate, edging down 0.1 percent during
the quarter.  In the third quarter of 2011, nonfarm business productivity
growth was little changed, at 1.8 percent. However, unit labor
costs increased 3.9 percent rather than falling 2.1 percent as
reported February 2, due to a 6.0 percentage point upward
revision to hourly compensation and the slight downward
revision to productivity.  In the manufacturing sector,
productivity grew slightly less than previously reported. Unit
labor costs fell less than previously reported due primarily
to a large upward revision to hourly compensation.  Annual Average productivity growth for 2011 in both the
nonfarm business and manufacturing sectors was slightly less
than previously reported, due to upward revisions to hours
worked; output increased at the same rates reported February
2. The 0.4 percent increase in nonfarm business productivity
was the smallest annual gain in the series since a 0.4 percent
gain in 1995. In both the nonfarm business and manufacturing
sectors, unit labor costs were revised upward for 2011; this
was due both to upward revisions to hourly compensation and
downward revisions to productivity. Unit labor costs rose 2.0
percent in the nonfarm business sector and declined 0.8
percent in the manufacturing sector. Real hourly compensation,
which takes into account changes in consumer prices, decreased
0.7 percent in 2011 in the nonfarm business sector.  This is
the largest annual decline in the measure since a 1.7 percent
decline in 1989.  The preliminary Productivity and Costs press release for first-
quarter 2012 is scheduled to be released on Thursday, May 3,
2012 at 8:30 a.m. (EDT).
