Gold rebounded from a five-week low
amid renewed optimism that  Greece  will be able to tame its debt
crisis and as a report showed increased U.S. hiring.  Investors with holdings amounting to at least 58 percent of
the Greek bonds eligible for the nation’s debt swap have
indicated they’ll participate, moving the country closer to the
biggest sovereign restructuring in history. U.S. companies added
216,000 workers last month, according to data based on payrolls
from ADP Employer Services. Yesterday, gold declined to
$1,663.40 an ounce, the lowest since Jan. 25.  “There is some positive news out there for the economy,
and that is helping gold,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “Some
investors are back after the big fall.”  Gold futures for April delivery gained 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,683.90 at 1:59 p.m. on the Comex in  New York .
Prices retreated 2.9 percent in the previous three sessions.  Bullion dropped below its 200-day moving average yesterday
for the first time since mid-January. Falling below the measure,
currently at about $1,674, can be a bearish signal to some
investors follow historical price patterns.  “The metal remains vulnerable to further pressure in the
short term,”  James Moore , an analyst at TheBullionDesk.com in
London, said in a report.  Silver futures for May delivery gained 2.4 percent to
$33.585 an ounce in New York. Yesterday, prices slid to $32.49,
the lowest since Jan. 25. Still, it’s the best-performing
