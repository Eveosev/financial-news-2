The 21-year-old son of Miami
Dolphins coach Joe Philbin had alcohol and marijuana in his
system when he fell through the ice and drowned two months ago
in a frozen river in Oshkosh,  Wisconsin , authorities said.  The investigation into Michael Philbin’s death has been
closed, the Oshkosh Police Department, in conjunction with the
Winnebago County Coroner’s Office, said today in a statement.  Michael Philbin died two weeks before his father, the
former offensive coordinator for the  Green Bay Packers , was
hired by the Dolphins. His death was ruled an accidental
drowning and toxicology reports showed he had a blood-alcohol
level of .176, more than twice the legal limit to drive in
Wisconsin. He also tested positive for marijuana, police said.  “The loss of a child and a sibling is absolutely
heartbreaking to a family,” Joe Philbin said in a statement
through the Dolphins. “Ours is no different. We hope that the
results of the recent toxicology report serves as a reminder to
us all that the mixture of alcohol and marijuana can be
extremely dangerous; potentially even fatal.”  Michael Philbin was visiting friends at the  University of
Wisconsin  at Oshkosh when he fell through the ice on the Fox
River on Jan. 8. He was alone at the time of his death and
divers recovered his body the next day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
