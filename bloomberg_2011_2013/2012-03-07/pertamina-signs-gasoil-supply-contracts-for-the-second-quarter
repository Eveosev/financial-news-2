Indonesia’s state oil company  PT
Pertamina (PERT)  signed contracts to import gasoil, or diesel, in the
second quarter, according to an official who declined to be
identified because of internal rules.  The Jakarta-based company will ship 600,000-barrel cargoes
at a premium of less than 80 cents a barrel to its price
formula, the official said. The price includes the cost of the
shipping. It will also buy 200,000-barrel cargoes at a premium
of more than $1 a barrel.  Sellers include a unit of South Korea’s SK Innovation Co.,
Petroliam Nasional Bhd. of  Malaysia ,  PTT Pcl (PTT)  of  Thailand  and
Kuwait Petroleum Corp, according to the Pertamina official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
