Italian and Spanish bonds rose after
investors with 58 percent of the Greek bonds eligible for the
nation’s debt swap indicated they’ll participate, boosting
demand for the region’s higher-yielding assets.  Italy’s 10-year yields fell toward the lowest since August
after a member of a committee of private bondholders who
negotiated the deal said he expects holders of more than 80
percent of  Greece ’s bonds to sign up to the exchange. German 10-
year yields were two basis points from a seven-week low after a
report showed factory orders unexpectedly fell in January.
Germany sold 3.3 billion euros ($4.33 billion) of five-year
notes at a record-low yield.  “The news related to the Greek deal isn’t fantastic but
there’s nothing that looks like it might be derailing the whole
thing,” which is helping Italian and Spanish debt, said  Marc Ostwald , a strategist at Monument Securities Ltd. in London.
“The German factory orders don’t make for great reading,
there’s a loss of momentum and that means there are a lot of
people who are a little bit wary.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  fell 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, to 4.95 percent at 4:17 p.m. London time after
dropping to 4.89 percent on March 2, the lowest since Aug. 18.
The 5 percent bond maturing in March 2022 gained 0.92, or 9.20
euros per 1,000-euro face-amount, to 100.865.  The Spanish  10-year yield  declined five basis points to 5.1
percent, and similar-maturity French yields dropped four basis
points to 2.84 percent.  Greek Investors  Greece’s largest banks, most of the country’s pension
funds, and more than 30 European banks and insurers including
BNP Paribas SA, Commerzbank AG and  Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G) 
have pledged to accept the offer. That brings the total so far
to at least 120 billion euros, based on data compiled by
Bloomberg from company reports and government statements.  Hans Humes, president of Greylock Capital Management in  New
York , told Bloomberg Television he expects holders of more than
80 percent of Greece’s government bonds to accede to the swap.
The goal of the plan is to reduce the 206 billion euros of
privately held Greek debt by 53.5 percent. The offer will end
tomorrow evening in  Athens .  The price of the Greek note maturing on March 20 jumped
7.28 to 28.8 percent of face value as some investors bet the
security may not be included in the swap.  Patrick Armstrong ,
managing partner at Armstrong Investment Managers in London,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview he won’t voluntarily
join the exchange because of the “minuscule” chance the bond
will be redeemed at face value.  ‘Safe-Haven Demand’  Ten-year  German yields  were little changed at 1.78 percent
after declining to 1.77 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 16.  German factory orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and
inflation, dropped 2.7 percent from December, the Economy
Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists forecast a gain of 0.6
percent, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  “Safe-haven demand for bunds remains in place even with
yields close to their historic lows,”  John Davies , a fixed-
income strategist at WestLB AG in London, wrote today in an e-
mailed statement.  Germany  sold 0.75 percent notes due in February 2017 at an
average yield of 0.79 percent, a record low for the securities.
That compares with 0.91 percent at the previous auction on Feb.
8. Investors bid for 1.8 times the amount allotted, the same as
the previous auction.  The 10-year German bund futures rose to a euro-era high of
140.52 before trading little changed at 140.26. The next level
of so-called resistance is 140.87, according to Viola Stork and
Ulrich Wortberg, analysts at Helaba Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen
in  Frankfurt . Resistance refers to an area where sell orders may
be clustered.  German bonds returned 0.4 percent this year, after rising
9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Italian securities have gained 12 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
