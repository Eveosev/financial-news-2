Gevo Inc. (GEVO) , the U.S. biotechnology
company backed by oil refiner Total SA and specialty chemicals
maker  Lanxess AG (LXS) , rose the most in a week after the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office agreed to reexamine a patent of rival
 Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC (0031863D) .  Gevo, based in Englewood,  Colorado ,  climbed  9.1 percent to
$7.82 at the close in  New York , the most since Feb. 29.  Gevo and Butamax, a joint venture of  BP Plc (BP/)  and DuPont Co.,
are developing processes to make isobutanol from corn and non-
food crops and have been sparring over  patent rights . Isobutanol
may be blended with gasoline or refined into jet fuel, specialty
chemicals or other products that are typically derived from
petroleum.  Gevo yesterday said the PTO would reexamine a
“foundational” patent covering Butamax’s process. The office
in November agreed to review a separate Butamax patent that was
issued in August.  Butamax said today its patents remain “in full force and
effect” and the review may take years to resolve.  The two patents are part of an infringement lawsuit that
Wilmington, Delaware-based Butamax brought against Gevo in
January 2011 and is set for a 2013 trial.  Gevo has countersued, claiming that Butamax is infringing
on new patents issued to it in September and January.  The Butamax case is Butamax v. Gevo, 11-CV-00054, U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). The Gevo case
is Gevo v. Butamax, 12-CV-70, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
