Romania should restore public-sector
wages to pre-crisis levels as of June 1 after a 25 percent cut
two years ago, President Traian Basescu said.  The Bucharest-based government, which already granted a 15
percent wage increase last year as part of a plan to bring the
incomes of public workers back to the level in June 2010, must
find a solution to fully restore salaries, Basescu said in a
speech in Parliament today.  Former Prime Minister Emil Boc, who resigned on Feb. 6, cut
public wages and increased taxes to meet pledges to the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European and keep funds
flowing from a bailout loan to help the country exit its worst
recession on record. The Balkan nation stopped relying on its
international lenders last year as the economy grew 2.5 percent.  “It’s our duty to think and find solutions,” Basescu
said. “The country’s budget turned to a deficit in February
after a surplus in January and will probably post a minus in
March too, but that’s mainly due to bad weather.”  The new government, lead by Prime Minister Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu, pledged to cut the  budget deficit  to 1.9 percent of
gross domestic product this year from 4.35 percent last year.  The country relied on a 20 billion-euro ($26 billion) loan
from the IMF and the EU from 2009 to 2011 and secured another 5
billion-euro precautionary accord with the lenders to reassure
investors it will keep fiscal discipline ahead of the elections
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
