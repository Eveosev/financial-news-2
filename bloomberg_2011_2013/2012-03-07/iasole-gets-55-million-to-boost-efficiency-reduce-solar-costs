MiaSole Inc., a closely held
manufacturer of thin-film solar products, raised $55 million
from investors to improve efficiency and reduce panel costs,
said Chief Executive Officer John Carrington.  MiaSole is currently producing panels that convert 14
percent of the energy in sunlight into electricity and
Carrington said he expects to increase that to 15 percent by the
end of this year.  Higher efficiency will reduce the cost of its copper-
indium-gallium-selenide panels to less than 80 cents a watt,
Carrington said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
