Rick Santorum  won the Oklahoma
Republican presidential primary, networks projected, overcoming
a last-minute endorsement of rival Mitt Romney by  Tom Coburn ,
one of the state’s U.S. senators.  MSNBC and Fox projected Santorum’s victory over former
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, U.S. Representative Ron Paul
of Texas and former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich.  The victory by Santorum, a former U.S. senator from
Pennsylvania, illustrates the difficulty Romney has had
garnering support from Republicans in southern states who focus
on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. Romney lost
the South Carolina primary in January to Gingrich, who also won
today’s Georgia primary.  “We’re going to win a few, we’re going to lose a few,”
Santorum told supporters in Steubenville,  Ohio . “We’re ready to
win across this country,”  Most of Oklahoma’s 43 delegates to the  Republican National
Convention  in August will be allotted proportionally, based on
candidate vote totals statewide and in each congressional
district.  Coburn, who won a second Senate term in 2010 with 71
percent of the vote, announced his Romney endorsement in the
Oklahoman newspaper on March 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
