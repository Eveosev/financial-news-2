Abraaj Capital Ltd., the  Middle
East ’s biggest private equity company, bought a $125 million
stake in a Moroccan investor in insurance companies to help it
expand across the African market.  The investment in Saham Finances will enable it to make
acquisitions in the “high growth markets” of Africa and the
Middle East, where insurance penetration remain “extremely
low,” Dubai-based Abraaj said in an e-mailed statement today.  Saham’s three subsidiaries,  CNIA Saada (CNIA) , Colina and Isaaf,
offer life and non-life products in  Morocco  and more than 10
other countries in French-speaking West Africa, Abraaj said.
CNIA Saada, listed on the Casabalanca Stock Exchange, is the
second-largest non-life insurance provider in Morocco with 16
percent market share, Abraaj said. Colina is ranked second in
the life and non-life segments across 11 countries in  Africa 
with an 11 percent market share, the firm said.  “Our investment in Saham Finances is in line with our
focus on supporting strong companies active in high-impact
sectors in rapidly growing economies,” Matteo Stefanel, senior
partner at Abraaj Capital, said in the statement. “As a leader
in insurance in Morocco and francophone West Africa, we see
tremendous opportunities for Saham Finances.”  Abraaj oversees $7.5 billion across more than 30 emerging
market countries. The private equity firm agreed last month to
buy London-based Aureos Capital Ltd., which specializes in
investing in small- and medium-sized firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
