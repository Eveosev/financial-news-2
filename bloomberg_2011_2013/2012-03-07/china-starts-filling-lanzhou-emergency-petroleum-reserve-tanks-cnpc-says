China  started filling its emergency
petroleum reserve at Lanzhou in the nation’s northwest,
according to an official at the nation’s largest crude producer.  The oil is from fields in  Gansu province  and Xinjiang in
northwestern China and Central Asian countries, Yu Baocai, a
vice president at  China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPZ) , said in
Beijing today.  China, the world’s second-largest crude consumer, finished
filling the first phase of its emergency stockpile with 103.2
million barrels of oil in 2009. The second phase, comprising
eight locations with a storage capacity of 168.6 million
barrels, is scheduled to be completed by early 2013. The Lanzhou
depot has a capacity of 18.9 million barrels.  The nation imports 10 million metric tons of crude a year,
or 200,000 barrels a day, from Central Asia via a pipeline from
 Kazakhstan  that started in 2006. The annual capacity of the
cross-border oil line, China’s first, will rise to 20 million
tons by 2013, according to CNPC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
