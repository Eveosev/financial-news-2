German  government bonds  pared their
decline after a report showed factory orders unexpectedly fell
as the slowing global economy cut foreign demand.  The yield on the 10-year  bund  was one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, higher at 1.79 percent at 11:05 a.m. London
time, after earlier to 1.80 percent.  Orders, adjusted for seasonal swings and inflation, fell
2.7 percent from December, when they gained 1.6 percent, the
Economy Ministry in Berlin said today. Economists forecast a 0.6
percent increase, according to the median of 37 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.   Italian 10-year bonds stayed higher, with the yield
dropping eight basis points to 4.99 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
