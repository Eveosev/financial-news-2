New Zealand (ANZ) ’s central bank left
interest rates at a record low as weak economic growth, a rising
currency and delays in rebuilding the earthquake-damaged city of
Christchurch reduce inflation pressures.  The official cash rate stayed 2.5 percent, Reserve Bank
Governor Alan Bollard said in a statement in Wellington today.
The decision was forecast by all 16 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Bollard has held the cash rate since March last year to
allow the economy to recover after the nation’s deadliest
earthquake in 80 years rocked its second-largest city, killing
185 people and closing the central city. The recovery has been
slow amid concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis would spill over
into weak global demand for exports, which make up 30 percent of
New Zealand’s economy.  “The inflation picture looks much friendlier than it did a
few months ago and an unexpected surge in the  exchange rate  has
further mitigated the need for policy tightening any time
soon,” Dominick Stephens, Auckland-based chief New Zealand
economist at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  said before the statement. He
expects a rate rise in December.  New Zealand’s dollar, the best-performing Group of 10
currency in the past year, fell after Bollard’s comments. It
bought 81.81 U.S. cents at 9:01 a.m. in Wellington from 81.95
cents immediately before the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
