Bon-Ton Stores Inc. (BONT) ’s bonds rose to
the highest in four months as the retailer projected that it
would generate as much as $70 million of cash this year.  Bon-Ton’s $480 million of 10.25 percent notes due in March
2014 rose 5 cents to 72 cents on the dollar to yield 29.3
percent at 12:51 p.m. in  New York , the highest price since
November, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. There were 44
trades of at least $1 million of the debt today, the most of any
U.S. bond, Trace data show.  Bon-Ton, which has department stores in the U.S. Northeast
and Midwest, is seeking to lure new customers with trendier
clothes as it tries to make enough money to pay off or refinance
its debts before they come due in two years. In January, the
chain appointed Brendan Hoffman, the former head of Lord &
Taylor LLC, as chief executive officer.  The York, Pennsylvania-based retailer said today in a
statement that it expects to produce $60 million to $70 million
of free  cash flow  this year. Net income fell to $78.2 million in
the fourth quarter from $85 million a year earlier, the company
said.  Bon-Ton also said that it bought back $16 million of the
bonds in January after repurchasing $30 million in November. Its
stock soared 29 percent to $6.76 at 1:58 p.m. in New York, the
highest price since September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
