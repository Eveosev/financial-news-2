Tanzania will reach its forecast
economic growth of 6 percent for fiscal 2011-12 and may even
surpass the figure, the Bank of Tanzania said.  The forecast for the 12 months through June is based on
“the performance of most leading indicators in the fourth
quarter of 2011,” the central bank said in an e-mailed
statement today from  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital.
“GDP for the first three quarters of 2011 is estimated to have
grown by 6.3 percent, exceeding 6.0 percent projected for
2011.”  The bank expects  East Africa ’s second-biggest economy to
maintain “strong momentum” in the first half of 2012, assuming
“good weather combined with return to normal of hydro power
generation, which will steer further economic activities in
agriculture and industry,” according to the statement.  The  International Monetary Fund  may raise its current
forecasts for 6 percent growth in Tanzania in 2011 and 6.7
percent in 2012 on the increased availability of power, John
Wakeman-Linn, the Fund’s Dar es Salaam-based representative,
said a Feb. 28 interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
