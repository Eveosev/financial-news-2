New York’s  Suffolk County (8320MF) , home to
 Long Island ’s Hamptons beach communities, is in a fiscal
emergency after ending its budget year with a deficit for the
first time in two decades, said its executive, Steve Bellone.  Suffolk has a three-year deficit of $530 million, Bellone
said in a statement announcing the emergency on the county’s
website. The declaration gives him the authority to withhold as
much as 10 percent of each county department’s budget, he said.  “The truth is worse than any of us could have imagined,”
Bellone said in the  statement , posted yesterday.  The county, with a 2010 population of about 1.5 million,
had its  credit rating  put on review in December by Moody’s
Investors Service, signaling it faces a possible downgrade on
$1.3 billion of long-term general-obligation debt.  The fiscal emergency won’t prompt an immediate rating
action from  Fitch Ratings  because the negative outlook it placed
on the county in November incorporates Suffolk’s "weakened
financial condition and heightened credit risk,”  Karen Wagner ,
a Fitch analyst, said today in a statement.  Suffolk has a median household income of $84,506, compared
with $55,603 for the state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  Pension Costs  The county’s 2011 budget ended out of balance by about $33
million and it faces deficits of $148 million in its $2.6
billion budget for 2012 and $349 million in 2013, Bellone said.
Pension costs are projected to almost double to $192 million in
2013 from $102 million last year, according to a report by the
county’s Budget and Finance Committee presented to Bellone
yesterday.  “In the coming days and weeks I will be working with
elected officials at all levels of government, including the
Legislature, on a mitigation plan to put this county back on a
fiscally sustainable path,” Bellone said. “This process will
not be easy, it will undoubtedly require difficult and painful
steps.”  Moody’s Aa2 rating on the county’s tax-exempt debt, its
third-highest level, was put on review due to “our expectation
that the county’s financial operations will be challenged by its
narrowed cash position, with the potential for further financial
weakness without the implementation of proposed midyear
expenditure reductions,” analysts wrote in a Dec. 14 report.  Moody’s Review  The review will focus on the implementation of 2012 budget
cuts, the prospect of a long-term balanced budget and improved
cash flow, Moody’s wrote. The ratings company said at the time
it expected to complete the review within 90 days.  A Suffolk County general-obligation bond sold in 2009 and
due October 2028 traded yesterday as high as 105.95 cents on the
dollar, down from 108.09 cents on Feb. 8 and higher than 102.19
cents on Jan. 4, the first trade after Moody’s put the county on
review, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Neighboring Nassau County had its finances taken over in
January 2011 by a state oversight board, which ruled the
municipality had a budget gap of more than 1 percent of
projected spending.  To contact the reporters on this story:
