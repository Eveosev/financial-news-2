ABN Amro  Group NV, the Dutch lender
nationalized in 2008, is taking over some of Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s commercial-banking activities in the
Netherlands to bolster its position in its home country.  The segments include corporate finance, equity brokerage
and capital structuring, and employ about 70 people, Amsterdam-
based ABN Amro said in an e-mailed statement today. ABN Amro
isn’t paying for the businesses, part of a unit that  RBS (RBS)  is
ending worldwide, said Joop Wijn, an ABN Amro boardmember.  With the transaction, ABN Amro is getting back some of the
assets RBS acquired from the Dutch bank’s predecessor five years
ago, Wijn said. RBS,  Spain ’s  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and Fortis
bought ABN Amro in 2007 for about 72 billion euros ($95 billion)
in the world’s biggest banking takeover. A year later, Fortis
ran out of funding, and the Netherlands bought its Dutch banking
and insurance units and its stake in ABN Amro Holding NV.  “The people we spoke to said it feels like coming home,”
Wijn, who is responsible for commercial banking at ABN Amro,
said in a telephone interview. The takeover is a “signicant
expansion of ABN’s merchant banking team.”  The Dutch bank anticipates growth, he said.  RBS, Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, said in
January it would cut about 3,500 jobs at its investment-banking
division and sell or close the unprofitable cash-equities,
mergers-advisory and equity-capital-markets divisions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
