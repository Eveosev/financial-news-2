Sterling Resources Ltd. (SLG) , a Calgary-
based oil-and-gas explorer, fell the most in seven months after
disclosing a rise in costs expected to develop a  North Sea  gas
platform, as well as a drop in reserves at the field.  Sterling declined 11 percent to close at C$1.91 in Toronto,
the biggest retreat since Aug. 4. The shares have lost 57
percent in the past 12 months.  A forecast for costs to develop the first phase of the
Breagh project in the southern North Sea rose to 566 million
pounds ($891 million), 17 percent higher than an estimate in
July, mostly because of expenses of installing an offshore
pipeline, the company said today in a statement.  Reserves for the Breagh project fell 11 percent after
“revised understanding and mapping of reservoir sands over the
eastern side of the field,” the company said.  The reduction in reserves “is a slight negative, but
should not cause undue concern,” James Hosie, an analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets , said today in a note to clients. He rates
Sterling shares “outperform.”  Sterling also said it has used 59 million pounds of a 105
million pound credit facility to pay for development of the
first phase of the Breagh project.  “We continue to believe Sterling can deliver the Breagh
development without the need to raise additional funds, but
would note that the tight funding position may limit its ability
to pursue other opportunities in its portfolio,” Hosie said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
