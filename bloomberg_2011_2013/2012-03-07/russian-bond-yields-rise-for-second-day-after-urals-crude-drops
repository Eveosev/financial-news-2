Russia’s dollar-denominated bonds
due 2020 retreated for a second day after Urals crude, the
country’s chief export, dropped to a one-week low.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020 fell, pushing the
yield up one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.986
percent as of 11:15 a.m. in Moscow. The yield on the
government’s ruble-denominated OFZ bonds maturing in 2021 rose
two basis points to 7.92 percent.  Urals (EUCRURNW)  dropped 1.4 perent to $121.12 per barrel by
yesterday’s close, the lowest price since Feb. 28. The Greek
government said it will use collective action clauses to compel
bondholders to accept its debt restructuring if it receives
sufficient consent from investors, as the European Union seeks
to avert a disorderly default by the country.  The ruble was little changed at 29.6423 per dollar and lost
0.3 percent to 38.9901 per euro. It fell 0.2 percent to 33.8503
against the central bank’s target dollar-euro basket. Investors
increased bets on the Russian currency weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing it at 30.0065 per dollar in three
months, compared with expectations of 29.9895 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
