Nigeria  approved the recommendations
made by a presidential committee that proposed dialogue and
amnesty to Boko Haram Islamist militants in the northeast if
they agree to give up their weapons, Information Minister
Labaran Maku said.  “The government is taking every measure possible to defeat
the violence and restore peace in the northeast,” Maku told
reporters in Abuja, the capital, today. The government accepted
most of the recommendations of the committee, he said. The
committee’s report was submitted to President Goodluck Jonathan
in September.  Authorities in Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram, which draws inspiration from  Afghanistan ’s Taliban
movement, for a surge of violence in the north and Abuja, in
which hundreds have died since 2009. Boko Haram, whose name
means “Western education is a sin,” claimed responsibility for
multiple blasts and attacks on Jan. 20 in Kano, northern
Nigeria’s biggest city, which killed at least 256 people,
according to the Civil Rights Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
