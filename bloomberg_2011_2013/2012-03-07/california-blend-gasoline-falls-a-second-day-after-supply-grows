California-blend gasoline slipped
for a second day after  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  started a hydrogen plant at
the  Golden Eagle (TEMTCRUD)  refinery and the state Energy Commission said
motor gasoline inventories jumped 14 percent last week.  Tesoro started the No. 2 hydrogen plant at the 170,000-
barrel-a-day plant near Martinez,  California , yesterday
following two other unit startups March 2 and Feb. 23, county
regulators said. California gasoline inventories rose for the
first time in three weeks, by 976,000 barrels to 7.98 million,
in the week ended March 2 from a week earlier, the state said.  Carbob in  San Francisco (MOGSD85P)  dropped 1 cent to a premium of 17
cents a gallon against gasoline futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The same fuel in  Los Angeles (MOGLDB85)  declined 0.5 cent to a 20.5-cent
premium versus futures.  Units at Tesoro’s Golden Eagle refinery “continue to
undergo planned maintenance” that began in January, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at the company’s headquarters in  San
Antonio , said in an e-mail today. Tesoro doesn’t expect the work
to affect commitments to customers, she said.  Gasoline supplies  on the U.S. West Coast rose 1.8 percent
to 31.2 million barrels in the week ended March 2, the Energy
Department said today.  California-blend diesel, or CARB diesel, in  Los Angeles (DIEILCAD) 
fell for the first time in seven days, by 0.5 cent to a 20-cent
premium against Nymex heating oil futures. The same fuel in  San
Francisco (DIEISCAD)  dropped 2 cents to a premium of 18 cents versus
heating oil futures.  Jet fuel  in  Los Angeles  rose for the sixth straight day,
gaining 0.25 cent to a premium of 16 cents against Nymex heating
oil futures, the highest level since May 20.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland (MOGHD87P) ,  Oregon ,
weakened 1 cent to a discount of 13.5 cents a gallon against
gasoline futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
