The Polish zloty stayed stronger
against the euro after the central bank left borrowing costs
unchanged for a ninth month.  The zloty gained 0.1 percent to 4.1622 per euro as of 1
p.m. in Warsaw. The Narodowy Bank Polski kept the benchmark
seven-day interest rate at 4.5 percent at the meeting in Warsaw,
matching the forecasts of all 36 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
