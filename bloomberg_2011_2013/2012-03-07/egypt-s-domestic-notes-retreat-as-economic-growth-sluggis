Egypt ’s domestic bills retreated
after the government announced economic growth in the last
quarter of 2011 was little improved as the tourism and
construction industries contracted.  The mid-yield on the country’s local-currency  one-year
notes  increased 4 basis points to 15.8 percent, according to
secondary-market prices compiled by Bloomberg from 15
contributors. The rate on  one-week securities  advanced seven
basis points to 12.1 percent.  Gross domestic product expanded 0.4 percent in the three
months that ended Dec. 31, compared with growth of 0.2 percent
in the previous quarter and 5.6 percent a year earlier, the
Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation said
yesterday. Tourism shrank 6.5 percent in the quarter after
contracting 10.4 percent in the previous three months, according
to the report. Construction, which fell 2.8 percent in the first
quarter of the fiscal year, dropped 0.6 percent.  The government is awaiting parliamentary approval for an
economic program that reduces the  budget deficit  and public debt
over the next two years before submitting it to the
 International Monetary Fund  for a $3.2 billion loan. IMF money
would help meet financing needs of about $11 billion by June
2013, Minister of Finance Momtaz el-Saieed said last month.  The yield on the country’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 retreated one basis point, or 0.01 of a percentage point,
to 6.82 percent at 3:55 p.m. in Cairo, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The Egyptian pound was little-changed
today at 6.0367 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
