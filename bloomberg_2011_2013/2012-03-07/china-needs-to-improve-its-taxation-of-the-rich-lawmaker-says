China  should improve its ability to
tax the “truly wealthy” to narrow a growing income gap and
stem rising mistrust of the government, Cai Fang, a member of
the country’s legislature, said today.  The government should amend policies so that income the
wealthy earn outside of salaries, such as from ownership of coal
mines and stakes in former state-owned enterprises, is more
effectively taxed, Cai, a member of the standing committee of
the National People’s Congress, told reporters in Beijing today.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  pledged in his state-of-the-nation
speech to the legislature this week to “vigorously adjust” the
distribution of incomes in the country. China has boosted
minimum wages, exempted lower wage earners from income taxes and
announced plans to build 36 million units of low-cost housing in
the five years through 2015 as part of the government’s campaign
to narrow the wealth gap.  “The common people are still feeling that the wage gap is
growing, and the real reason is due to increasing income from
property assets,” said Cai, who is also director of the
Institute of Population and Labor Economics at the  Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences .  “Many people acquire such assets
due to special interests, so the common people will increasingly
distrust the government if this continues.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
