The onshore shift to oil and
natural-gas liquids from natural gas has spilled over into the
shallow waters of the U.S.  Gulf of Mexico ,  Hercules Offshore
Inc. (HERO)  said today.  About 75 percent of the wells that Hercules rigs are
drilling today are for oil or gas in the Gulf of  Mexico , James Noe, senior vice president at Hercules said in an interview at
CERAWeek, a Houston conference held by IHS Cambridge Energy
Research Associates. Three years ago, 80 percent of the wells
drilled were for gas.  Hercules, which is operating all 18 of its marketed rigs in
the Gulf, is looking to fill “several hundred” job openings,
he said. The company has as many as six of its 18 idled rigs
that it’s constantly evaluating for possible new work.  “Demand for our services is at its highest level since
2008,” Noe said. “No one’s targeting natural gas offshore. Now
we’re an oil and natural-gas-liquids-driven business.  The company, which has a total of 62 rigs in its global
fleet, first saw the shift in the Gulf about 14 months ago, Noe
said.  After companies such as  Energy XXI Bermuda Ltd. (EXXS)  and  Apache
Corp. (APA)  made acquisitions in the shallow waters of the Gulf, more
oil is being discovered as producers use new technology to
reevaluate the properties, he said.  Hercules, which has 10 buy ratings from analysts, 6 holds
and 6 sells, has fallen 12 percent over the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
