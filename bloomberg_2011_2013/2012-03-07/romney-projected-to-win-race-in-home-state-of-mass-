Mitt Romney  won today’s Republican
presidential primary in  Massachusetts , the state he led as
governor from 2003 to 2007, the Associated Press projected.  With 76 percent of precincts reporting, Romney had 72
percent of the vote, followed by former Pennsylvania Senator
 Rick Santorum  with 12 percent, Texas Representative  Ron Paul 
with about 10 percent and former U.S. Speaker Newt Gingrich with
almost 5 percent, according to the AP. None of Romney’s rivals
campaigned for the state’s 41 delegates.  “We’re on our way,” Romney told a rally in Boston. “I’m
going to get this nomination.” He said he’d take his victory in
Massachusetts “all the way to the White House.”  Romney’s role in helping craft a state law during his
gubernatorial tenure that served as a model for the federal
health-care overhaul President  Barack Obama  pushed through
Congress in 2010 has been a constant issue in this year’s
Republican race.  His rivals have said the Massachusetts law will undercut
his ability to run against Obama on the health-care issue.
Romney has dismissed such criticism and pledged to make repeal
of the federal measure one of his main priorities as president.  Massachusetts and Vermont were the only two northeastern
states that reported a gain in economic health between the third
quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2011, according to the
Bloomberg Economic Evaluation of States.  Romney also won Vermont and Virginia, according to the AP’s
tally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
