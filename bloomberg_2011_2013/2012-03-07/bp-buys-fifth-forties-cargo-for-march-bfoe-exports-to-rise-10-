BP Plc bought a cargo of  North Sea 
 Forties (EUCSFORT)  crude, bringing its total for March to five shipments.
Gunvor Group Ltd. failed to sell Russian Urals blend in
northwest  Europe  for the second day after it raised its offer
price from yesterday.  Exports of the North Sea Brent, Forties, Oseberg and
Ekofisk crude blends will rise by 10 percent in April from this
month to 1.05 million barrels a day, loading programs obtained
by Bloomberg News show.  North Sea  BP bought one cargo of Forties for loading on March 27 to
March 29 from Trafigura Beheer BV at $2.25 a barrel more than
the cash cost of North Sea crude for May, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
trading window. Yesterday, BP bought one shipment at a premium
of $1.70 to Dated Brent.  Vitol Group failed to buy Forties for March 23 to March 25
loading at $1.45 more than Dated Brent, according to the survey.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the

more than  Dated Brent (EUCRBRDT) , down from yesterday’s five-month high of
$1.76, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for April settlement traded at $122.96 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the

$122.44, a discount of 52 cents to April.  The loading program of Forties crude for April is scheduled
at 22 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, a plan obtained by
Bloomberg News shows.  Including two cargoes deferred from March, total exports in
April will be 24 shipments, compared with a revised 22 this
month, according to the plans.  A cargo of Forties crude with parcel number F0319 was
delayed by three days to March 27 to March 29, two people with
knowledge of the export program said, bringing the total
deferrals of March shipments to at least 10.  Exports of Troll crude will increase to 17 cargoes of
600,000 barrels each in April, two more than this month, a plan
shows.  Loadings of Gullfaks will drop by one shipment to five in
April, while Statfjord export will increase to four cargoes,
compared with three this month, the schedules show.  Exports of Grane will be unchanged at seven 600,000-barrel
cargoes and Alvheim exports will be stable at five shipments of
780,000 barrels each, according to the plans.  The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties blend was at 41
percent in the week to March 4, unchanged from a week earlier,
