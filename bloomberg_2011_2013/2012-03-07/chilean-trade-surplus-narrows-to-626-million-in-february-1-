Chile ’s trade surplus narrowed to
$626 million in February from the same month last year on a
surge in imports, the central bank said.  Imports leaped 18 percent to $5.69 billion, while exports
gained 10 percent $6.32 billion, including $3.37 billion of
copper, the bank said in a report posted on its website today.
The surplus compared with the $675 million median estimate of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg and $926 million a year ago.  The top copper-producing nation’s trade surplus will more
than half this year as the average price of the metal drops 13
percent to $3.50 a pound, the central bank said in December.
Average copper prices have exceeded that level so far this year
and the government has raised its price forecast to $3.85 a
pound on an improved outlook for the global economy.  “We’re in a phase of deceleration that is somewhat softer
than what was forecast some months ago,” Finance Minister
Felipe Larrain told reporters in Santiago March 5. “We have to
closely follow what’s happening abroad because a good
performance in one month doesn’t guarantee that we’re going to
continue like that for the rest of the year.”  Larrain spoke after data showed the economy surged a
faster-than-forecast 5.5 percent in January from the previous
year. Economic growth, measured by the central bank’s Imacec
index, has exceeded the median estimate of analysts polled by
Bloomberg in the past two months.  Europe ’s economy, which accounted for 20 percent of Chilean
exports last year, will contract 0.2 percent this year after
growing an estimated 1.5 percent in 2011, according to analysts
polled by Bloomberg. The region was Chile’s fastest-growing
export market in 2011.  Chile’s peso deprecated 0.2 percent to 492.13 per  U.S.
dollar  at 8:56 a.m. Santiago time from 491.25 at yesterday’s
1:30 p.m. close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
