Exports of North Sea Gullfaks will
drop to five cargoes in April, one less than this month, a
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  Loadings of Statfjord next month will be four cargoes, one
more than March, according to a separate plan. All shipments are
for 855,000 barrels each.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
