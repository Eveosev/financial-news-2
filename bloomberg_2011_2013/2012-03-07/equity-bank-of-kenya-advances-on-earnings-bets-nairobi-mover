Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender by customers, gained for a fourth day as investors bet
earnings will continue to increase.  The stock advanced 1 percent to close at 19.60 shillings
in Nairobi, the strongest since Nov. 15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The lender will announce 2011 full year earnings tomorrow.
In the nine months through September, net income jumped 42
percent to 7.29 billion shillings ($88.1 million) from 5.13
billion shillings a year earlier, Equity said Oct. 24. In the
full year to December 2010, profit increased 69 percent to 7.13
billion shillings.  “The earnings up to quarter three have surpassed the full
year for 2010,” Francis Mwangi, head of research at Nairobi-
based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in an interview in
Nairobi today. “My estimate is that earnings per share will
grow 31 percent because up to the third quarter there was
increased lending compared to 2010 and there is continued growth
in fees and commissions income.”  Full-year net income is likely to be 9.4 billion shillings,
George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based Apex Africa
Capital Ltd., said by phone. “Profit is being driven by very
robust non-interest income, mostly transaction fees.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
