Premier Power Renewable Energy Inc. (PPRW) ,
a U.S. developer of solar farms, started construction on a 16.2-
megawatt project in  Bulgaria .  The Zdravetz plant, a joint effort with the construction
company Plaan Czech s.r.o., is scheduled to be complete in the
second quarter, according to a statement yesterday from El
Dorado Hills, California-based Premier Power.  The project has a 20-year contract to sell electricity for
about 30 cents a kilowatt hour, Premier Power said in the
statement, without identifying the buyer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
