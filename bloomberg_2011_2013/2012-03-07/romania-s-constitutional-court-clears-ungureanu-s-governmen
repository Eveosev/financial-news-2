Romania’s  Constitutional Court  said
the appointment of the new government is legal, rejecting a
challenge by the opposition, one of the judges said.  The nine-judge court panel unanimously ruled in favor of
Mihai-Razvan Ungureanu’s cabinet, which passed a vote in
Parliament on Feb. 9, saying the vote was constitutional, judge
Acsinte Gaspar said in a phone interview today.  The opposition  Social Democratic Party  and the Liberal
Party challenged the appointment in court, citing illegal
procedural grounds after their members boycotted the vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
