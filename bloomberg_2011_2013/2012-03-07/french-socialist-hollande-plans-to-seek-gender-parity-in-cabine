Francois Hollande , the Socialist
Party frontrunner in France’s presidential race, said he would
seek to form a government with an equal number of women and men.  Hollande, 57, said he would also work to impose parity for
top administrative positions, including in the country’s
 Constitutional Court . He spoke in an interview today with  France
2 television . Women make up 29 percent of President Nicolas
Sarkozy’s current government.  Hollande reiterated a promise to renegotiate the European
Union’s fiscal treaty, calling for a focus on growth in the
Union, “and not just austerity” measures.  France will hold two rounds of presidential elections, in
April and in May.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
