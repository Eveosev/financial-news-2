Harvard University  clinched its
first trip to the National Collegiate Athletic Association men’s
basketball tournament since 1946 when the University of
Pennsylvania lost tonight at  Princeton University .  Penn fell 62-52 to Princeton in the conference’s season
finale, leaving the Quakers with an 11-3 record in Ivy League
play. Harvard won the league title and an automatic NCAA berth
with a 12-2 conference record.  Harvard senior forward and co-captain Keith Wright told the
Harvard Crimson student newspaper that he was thrilled to see an
end to the school’s 65-year tournament drought.  “This is absolutely crazy,” Wright said. “You have no
idea how excited I am. I’ve been running for 30 minutes, in the
freezing cold, screaming at the top of my lungs.”  Ian Hummer had 18 points for Princeton (19-11) in the game
at Jadwin Gymnasium in Princeton,  New Jersey . Zack Rosen had 19
points for Penn (19-12).  “I’m obviously disappointed,” Penn coach Jerome Allen
told reporters after his team’s seven-game winning streak ended.
“We wanted to control our own destiny and everything we did to
prepare was connected to winning the league.”  Harvard’s basketball team, which has gotten recent acclaim
because of graduate Jeremy Lin’s play for the National
Basketball Association’s New York Knicks, made its only NCAA
tournament appearance in 1946, when it lost to Ohio State and
 New York University .  To contact the reporter on this story:
