Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  plans to
hire 1,900  workers  this year as Asia’s largest international
carrier adds new aircraft and premium economy seating to meet
rising demand.  The carrier intends to add about 1,000 cabin crew, 300
pilots and 600 ground staff,  Carolyn Leung , a spokeswoman for
the Hong Kong-based company, said in an e-mailed statement
today. The target, which excludes regional arm Hong Kong Dragon
Airlines Ltd.’s hiring plan, is in line with last year’s goal to
add 2,000 workers.  Cathay last month took delivery of a new  Boeing Co. (BA) 
777-300ER, its first jet with premium economy class and new
long-haul coach seats to lure more passengers amid growing
competition from Hong Kong Airlines Ltd. Capacity will expand 7
percent for passengers and 10 percent for cargo in 2012, based
on estimates Cathay provided last year.  The company will receive a total of 15 planes this year,
including six Airbus SAS A330s, five 777-300ERs and four Boeing
747-8Fs. The carrier finished an upgrade of its reservation
system last month.  Cathay Pacific  fell  0.3 percent to HK$15.06 at the close of
trading in  Hong Kong . The stock has gained 13 percent this year,
compared with the 12 percent advance in the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index .  Dragonair plans to hire 450 cabin crew, 40 first officers
and 35 cadet pilots this year as it adds six planes and expands
its route network, the company said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
