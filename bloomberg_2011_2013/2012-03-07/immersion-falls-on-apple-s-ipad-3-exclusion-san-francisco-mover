Immersion Corp. (IMMR) , which makes a
technology that adds more sensation to touch screens, fell the
most since December as  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  didn’t say the company would
be involved in a new version of the iPad tablet computer.  Immersion  fell  as much as 7.3 percent in New York trading,
after earlier gaining as much as 12.1 percent, the most since
Nov. 11, on speculation that Apple might include its technology
in the iPad version unveiled today. Shares of Immersion were
trading at $6.45, down 3.6 percent, at 2:13 p.m. local time. The
stock had risen 29 percent this year before today.  “It happens every time Apple has a product -- retail
investors start to state that Immersion will be in the next-
generation product,” said Jeffrey Schreiner, an analyst with
Captsone Investments Inc. in  San Diego . “That ship has
sailed.”  San Jose , California-based Immersion, which makes a
technology called haptic, has tried for years to get into Apple
products, Schreiner said in a telephone interview. Apple started
announcing its new line, including an updated iPad, at 10 a.m.
in Cupertino, California.  Samsung uses Immersion’s haptic technology in some of its
mobile devices, said Mark Argento, an analyst with Craig-Hallum
Capital Group in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Reagan Crossley, a spokesman for the company, said
Immersion had no comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
