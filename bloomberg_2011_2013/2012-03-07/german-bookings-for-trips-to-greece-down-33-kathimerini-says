Tour operators including  TUI AG (TUI1)  and
Alltours are seeing a 33 percent drop in German bookings for
summer holidays in  Greece  compared with last year,  Kathimerini
reported .  Germans are choosing other destinations, because prices in
Greece havenâ€™t dropped and because of worries about anti-German
sentiment, the Athens-based newspaper said, citing comments by
Alltours founder Willi Verhuven.  To contact the reporter on this story:
