Bahrain’s security forces arrested a
group of protesters who attacked a police patrol in Sitra over
the weekend, the Interior Ministry said today in a statement
posted on its website.  Four policemen suffered severe burns when demonstrators in
Sitra hurled “a large number” of Molotov cocktails at the
patrol on March 3, the ministry said in a statement.  Tensions in the island nation persist a year after the
government quashed a month of anti-government rallies by mostly
Shiite demonstrators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
