Total SA sold gasoline for immediate
loading in northwest  Europe  for a fourth day. The fuel’s premium
to Brent, its crack, rose for the first time in four days.  Kuwait Petroleum International Ltd., a unit of Kuwait
Petroleum Corp., sold two cargoes of naphtha from its Milazzo
refinery on the Italian island of Sicily for loading this month,
a company official said.  Light Products  Gasoline (MOGEEURB)  barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $1,098 and $1,100 a metric ton,
according to a survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That’s within the range of yesterday’s
trades from $1,082 to $1,100.  Total, Chevron Corp. and Vitol Group were the sellers of
the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished
fuel. Trafigura Beheer BV was the largest buyer.  The front-month gasoline  crack  advanced to $10.77 a barrel,

and the other for March 18 to March 20, the official said,
declining to be identified citing company policy. Each shipment
is for 27,000 tons.  Naphtha’s  crack , or discount to Brent, narrowed for a
second day to $5.14 a barrel, PVM data showed. That compares
with $5.37 yesterday.  Middle Distillates  March gasoil advanced 50 cents, or 0.1 percent, to

according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Low-sulfur barges traded at $52.50 a ton more than high-
sulfur lots, close to the Feb. 29 high of $53.50. That was the
most since July 6.  Refineries  Tamoil SA halted its Collombey refinery in  Switzerland  on
March 2 because of a technical fault, according to the Romandie
news service.  The plant is scheduled to start at the end of the week,
Romandie said late yesterday on its website, citing the company.
The refinery can process about 50,000 barrels a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
