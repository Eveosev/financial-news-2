Ivory Coast ’s customs department
earned 11 percent more than expected last month after cocoa
shipments began following a dispute over a new system of selling
the beans, said Issa Coulibaly, director-general of customs.  Revenue at the West African nation’s customs department
reached 93 billion CFA francs ($186 million) in February, more
than forecasted earnings of 84 billion francs, he said in an
interview in the commercial capital, Abidjan, yesterday.  “Cocoa shipments have fully resumed,” Coulibaly said.  Ivory Coast, the world’s biggest producer of the chocolate
ingredient, began advanced sales of the beans in January. Some
exporters declined to participate in the auctions, demanding
that authorities provide guarantees before the upcoming harvest
is sold under the new system. An agreement was reached last
month.  The country may produce 1.39 million metric tons of cocoa
in the current 2011-2012 crop harvest,  Edward George , a
commodity specialist at  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , said in an
e-mailed report today.      To contact the reporter on this story:
