The Indian coffee harvest,  Asia ’s
third-biggest, may climb about 6.7 percent in the current season
with the help of favorable weather, according to the Coffee
Board of India.  Production is set to rise to 322,000 metric tons in the
2011-12 crop year begun in October, Chairman Jawaid Akhtar said
today in an interview in London. That compares with about
302,000 tons in the prior period, he said.  “We have been fortunate to have good rainfall,” Akhtar
said on the sidelines of International Coffee Organization
meetings scheduled to run through tomorrow. “Prices have been
good” and growers were able to improve husbandry, he said.  Exports will be “similar” to the 297,000 tons shipped in
the 2010-11 season, according to Akhtar. Italy, Germany and
 Russia  are the biggest customers, and Australia,  South Korea  and
the U.S. began importing Indian coffee recently, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
