Mineral and energy exports from
 Australia , the world’s largest shipper of  iron ore  and coal,
declined 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, led by lower prices
and volumes for iron and steel and liquefied petroleum gas.  Sales fell to A$51 billion ($54 billion) in the three
months ended Dec. 31, from the revised A$52 billion in the
September quarter, the  Bureau of Resources  and Energy Economics
 said  in a report. Earnings reached a record A$190 billion in
2011, 15 percent higher than the previous year, it said.  “Australian production of energy and mineral resources was
mixed in 2011 with increases in iron ore, copper and nickel
offset by lower output of coal and oil,” the bureau said today
in a separate  statement .  Iron and steel export earnings in the fourth quarter
dropped 56 percent to A$151 million, LPG fell 24 percent to
A$202 million and petroleum refinery products declined 59
percent to A$90 million, according to the bureau’s report.
Earnings for thermal coal rose 10 percent, gold advanced 7.8
percent and nickel gained 8.2 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
