Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  is selling at
least 250 million Swiss francs of contingent capital notes,
according to a person with knowledge of the transaction.  The so-called high-trigger buffer capital notes may pay a
coupon of about 7 percent to 7.25 percent and will mature in
March 2022, the person said. The securities, which are callable
in 2017, convert into shares if the bankâ€™s core tier 1 capital
drops below 7 percent, the person said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
