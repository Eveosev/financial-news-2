The loading program of North Sea
Forties crude for April is scheduled at 22 cargoes of 600,000
barrels each, a plan obtained by Bloomberg News shows.  Including two cargoes deferred from this month, total
exports in April will be 24 shipments, compared with a revised
22 this month, according to the plans.  At least nine cargoes for March loading were deferred by
one to eight days, according to a survey of five people with
knowledge of the export programs.  Forties (EUCSFORT)  rose to $1.76 a barrel more than Dated Brent
yesterday, the most since Sept. 30, and was at a premium of
$1.75 today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Forties is one of four North Sea oil grades that make up
the Dated Brent benchmark, which is used to price crude from the
 Middle East ,  Africa  and  Russia . The other blends are Ekofisk,
Brent and Oseberg.  “Forties will likely come under pressure in the coming
period, given poor regional demand and the weak Urals market,
which may incentivize refiners with more complex setups to turn
to the Russian medium-sour grade instead,” analysts led by
 Johannes Benigni , Vienna-based managing director at the
consulting firm, said in an e-mailed report today. “Higher
Nigerian exports expected in April will also add pressure.”  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
