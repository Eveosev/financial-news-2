Indonesia ’s rupiah gained by the
most in almost a week, reversing an earlier loss, on speculation
the central bank intervened and domestic demand for the dollar
eased. Bonds declined.  Bank Indonesia  has been intervening in the currency and
bond markets to curb volatility, Governor Darmin Nasution said
last month. The currency fell earlier on speculation slowing
growth in Europe and  China  was deterring risk-taking. Bank
Indonesia will keep its benchmark  interest rate   unchanged  at
5.75 percent tomorrow, according to 15 out of 16 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. One expects a 25-basis point cut.  “The central bank is always present in the market,” said
Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at ANZ Panin Bank in Jakarta.
“There was high demand for the dollar this morning but it eased
as the day went on.”  The rupiah gained 0.6 percent to 9,110 per dollar as of
4:59 p.m. in Jakarta after weakening as much as 0.4 percent
earlier, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  Foreign funds have reduced holdings of Indonesian
 government bonds  by more than 4 percent to 226.33 trillion
rupiah ($24.8 billion) since the end of January, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 5.84
percent, the highest since Jan. 18, according to closing prices
from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporters on this story:
