Nigeria ’s naira appreciated for a
second day as the central bank sold dollars and on increased
inflows of the U.S. currency from the oil industry.  The currency of  Africa ’s largest oil producer gained 0.1
percent to 157.45 per dollar by 3:15 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, its strongest since Feb. 23, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria sold $150 million at a foreign-currency auction
today, with lenders buying the entire amount on offer, the
Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said in an e-mailed
statement. The marginal rate, which is also used as the
prevailing exchange rate, was 156.01 naira, unchanged from the
previous sale on March 5, it said.  “Dealers expect the naira to appreciate as foreign
exchange liquidity is boosted by oil company dollar sales,”
analysts at Lagos-based Diamond Bank said in e-mailed note to
clients today.  The central bank offers dollars at auctions on Mondays and
Wednesdays to maintain exchange rate stability. The oil industry
is the second-largest supplier of the U.S. currency after the
central bank.  The auction allowed the naira to appreciate, Usman Onoja,
chief executive of Lagos-based Lovonus Bureau De Change Ltd.,
said by phone today. “The level of sales by the central bank
will largely determine the value of the naira.”  Ghana ’s cedi weakened by less than 0.1 percent to 1.7118
per dollar, as of 3:17 p.m. in Accra, the nation’s capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
