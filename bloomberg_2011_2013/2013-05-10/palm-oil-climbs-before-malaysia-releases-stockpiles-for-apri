Palm oil  rose to the highest level in
almost two weeks before the release of data from  Malaysia  which
may show that inventories dropped to a nine-month low.  The contract for July delivery climbed as much as 1.5
percent to 2,321 ringgit ($777) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest price for most active futures
since April 29, and was at 2,310 ringgit at 11:59 a.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures have gained 2.6 percent this week.  Reserves in Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer,
probably fell 5.1 percent to 2.06 million tons in April, the
least since July, a Bloomberg survey published this week showed.
Shipments fell 6.5 percent to 1.44 million tons, while output
gained 5.3 percent to 1.4 million tons, according to the survey.
Official data are due for release at 12:30 p.m.  “The expectations are that stocks will come down, so
market will take cue from there,” said James Ratnam, an analyst
at TA Securities Holdings Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur . “Exports will
be the key figure to watch for. There’s still a mixed view there
so we’ll have to see how exports perform.”  Exports from Malaysia declined 17 percent to 380,047 tons
in the first 10 days of this month from 456,440 tons in the same
period in April, surveyor Intertek said today.  Soybeans for July delivery were little changed at $14.0975
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean oil  rose 0.3
percent to 49.37 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 1 percent to
6,026 yuan ($981) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil advanced 1 percent to 7,436  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
