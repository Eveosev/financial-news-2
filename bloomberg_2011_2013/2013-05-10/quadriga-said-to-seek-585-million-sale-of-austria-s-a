Quadriga Capital , a buyout firm that
focuses on German-speaking countries, is exploring a sale of
Austrian refrigerator maker AHT Cooling Systems GmbH, according
to four people familiar with the talks.  The buyout firm may seek at least 450 million euros ($585
million) for AHT, which provides supermarket cooling systems for
groceries, ice cream and beverages, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because the deliberations are private. AHT
would probably attract bids from other buyout firms, they said.  Quadriga, which expanded AHT’s business into  China ,  Turkey 
and the U.K. after buying it in 2006, is considering a sale as
private-equity firms tap low borrowing costs and rising equity
markets to exit investments made before the financial crisis in
2007. Buyout transactions rose to $94 billion in the first
quarter, slightly up from the fourth quarter and the first
quarter of 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A spokesman for AHT declined to comment. Representatives
for Quadriga didn’t respond to several voicemails seeking
comment.  AHT traces its roots to an ironworks in Rottenmann,
 Austria , in  1442 , according to its website. The company
conducted an initial public offering in 1998 before being
delisted in Vienna five years later.  To contact the reporters on this story:
