Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s general counsel Ted Ullyot is leaving the company after helping to guide the social-networking service through an initial public offering a year
ago.  “Ted has been a valued member of Facebook’s leadership who
built our legal team through an intense five-year period in
which we faced complex and high-stakes legal issues of all
types,” the Menlo Park, California-based company said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Ullyot has been Facebook’s vice president, general counsel
and secretary since October 2008, regulatory filings show.
Previously, he was a partner at Kirkland & Ellis LLP and served
as chief of staff at the U.S. Justice Department and as a deputy
assistant to President George W. Bush.  His exit follows the departure of several Facebook
employees since the company held its IPO in May 2012. Blake Ross, product director, left earlier this year. Senior
executives Katie Mitic and Ethan Beard said in August that they
were leaving.  To contact the reporter on this story:
