Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS) , Colombia’s largest
cement maker, fell to a seven-month low after the company sold
1.4 trillion pesos ($763 million) of preferred shares at the low
end of its estimated range.  The common shares  dropped  4.4 percent to 7,880 pesos at the
close in Bogota, the lowest price since Oct. 2. The Medellin-based company sold the new shares for 7,700 pesos each,
according to a regulatory filing yesterday. Cemargos had
indicated in a filing on April 16 that they would probably price
in a range of 7,700 pesos to 9,300 pesos.  Today’s drop left the cement maker’s shares down 25 percent
since Feb. 14, the day before the company said it would sell the
preferred securities to “increase financial flexibility to
maximize growth opportunities.”  Carlos Yusty, the chief financial officer of Cementos
Argos, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request for
comment.  Chief Executive Officer Jorge Mario Velasquez said in
yesterday’s filing that the preferred shares got a “good
reception” that provided “a vote of confidence in the
company’s strategy to focus on the cement and concrete
business.”  Credicorp Capital’s  Colombia  unit said Cemargos’s preferred
shares may trade 185 pesos higher than the common shares because
they pay a larger dividend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
