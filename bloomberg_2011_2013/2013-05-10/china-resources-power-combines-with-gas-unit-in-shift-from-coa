State-owned  China Resources (836) 
(Holdings) Co. plans to combine two of its Hong Kong-traded
subsidiaries amid a shift from coal-fired power, sending shares
in its electricity generation unit down as much as 11 percent.  China Resources Power Holdings Co., an electricity
generator, will offer HK$24.64 a share for all the shares of
 China Resources Gas Group Ltd. (1193) , a natural gas distributor, both
companies said in a joint statement to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange today. There will be no cash alternative for the deal,
which values China Resources Gas at HK$54.8 billion ($7.1
billion). The offer represents a 13 percent premium to China
Resources Gas’s closing share price May 3, its last day of trade
before both stocks were suspended.  The integration of the two units comes amid pressure in
 China  to reduce pollution by shifting to cleaner fuels such as
natural gas. Shares of China Resources Power, which largely uses
coal for electricity generation, fell the most since November
2008 percent in morning trading in Hong Kong.  “The share movement has spoken for itself -- China
Resources Power investors were not happy about the premium being
proposed,” said Judith Chen, Shanghai-based utility analyst at
KGI Asia Ltd. “Over time, investors would have the chance to
look at the long-term benefit from the merger, which is to
provide a bigger platform for both companies that otherwise they
may not able to create alone.”  Higher Valuation  Natural gas distributors enjoy a higher valuation than
electricity companies in China, Chen said.  Shares of China Resources Gas declined 2.8 percent to
$HK$21.25 as of 11:09 a.m. China Resources Power was down 10
percent at HK22.85. The city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index dropped
0.1 percent.  China Resources Power will change its name to China
Resources Energy Holdings Ltd. upon completion of the deal and
China Resources Gas will be de-listed, according to the
statement.  China Resources Power’s market size is HK$108.9 billion,
while China Resources Gas is valued at HK$47.1 billion,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Their parent controls
11 listed companies in China, employs 400,000 workers, and made
a profit of HK$41.1 billion on revenue of HK$405.7 billion in
2012, according to its website.  Song Lin, Chairman of the parent, said the merger could be
completed between July and August, according to a report from
Hong Kong’s Sing Tao Daily on May 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
