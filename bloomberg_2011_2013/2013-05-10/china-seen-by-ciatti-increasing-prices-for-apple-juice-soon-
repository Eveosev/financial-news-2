China  will probably increase apple
juice prices “soon” after selling below the competition,
according to wine and grape broker Ciatta Co.  Domestic apple juice prices are about $9.50 to $10 a U.S.
gallon, and China is selling it at the low to mid $8 a gallon,
San Rafael, California-based Ciatti, which says it’s the world’s
largest broker of bulk wines, wrote in an e-mailed report today.
Few processors are willing to continue to manufacture large
quantities, it said.  Apple juice concentrate futures traded on the Minneapolis
Grain Exchange have dropped 12 percent this year to $7.45 a
gallon by yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
