YPF SA (YPF) , Argentina’s largest oil
company that was nationalized more than a year ago, said
quarterly profit slid 3 percent on higher costs and increased
fuel imports.  Net income dropped to 1.25 billion pesos ($249 million), or
3.2 pesos a share, in the first quarter from 1.29 billion pesos,
or 3.29 pesos, a year earlier, Buenos Aires-based YPF said in a
statement to Argentina’s regulator late yesterday.  President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner’s government
seized a 51 percent YPF stake from Repsol SA in April 2012 to
stem fuel imports that doubled to $9.4 billion in 2011 and are
expected to rise to as much as $15 billion this year. YPF is
trying to secure final accords with  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and Bridas
Corp. for a $37 billion expansion plan to develop the Vaca
Muerta shale formation, a Connecticut-sized area in southern
Argentina that contains at least 23 billion barrels of oil.  Crude output fell 1 percent in the quarter to 226,300
barrels of oil a day from a year earlier, while costs gained 34
percent in the period, primarily on higher fuel imports, the
company said in the statement.  The earnings report was released after the close of regular
market trading. YPF’s American depositary receipts fell 3.5
percent to $13.40 in New York yesterday. The ADRs have dropped
14 percent in the past year.  YPF will hold an earnings conference call with investors at
9 a.m. New York time today.  Argentina’s billionaire Eurnekian, the only ones who have
signed preliminary memorandum of understanding with YPF to
develop Vaca Muerta and hasn’t yet been sued by Repsol, may sign
a final deal before year end, Hugo Eurnekian said on April 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
