Chorus Aviation Inc. (CHR/B)  posted a record
drop after the carrier reported profit that missed analysts’
estimates and halved its quarterly dividend amid a dispute with
 Air Canada. (AC/A)   Chorus fell 21 percent to C$2.89 by the 4 p.m. close in
Toronto, its biggest single-day drop since Chorus -- previously
known as Jazz Income Fund -- began trading in January 2006.  Chorus, based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, operates regional
flights for  Air Canada (AC/B) , the country’s largest airline, under the
Jazz and Air Canada Express banners. The two companies are in
binding arbitration regarding a capacity purchase agreement, and
Chorus yesterday cited the dispute as one of the reasons behind
its decision to lower the dividend.  The payout cut is “a big surprise,” Kevin Chiang, an
analyst at  CIBC World Markets  in Toronto, said in a note to
clients late yesterday. “While the company is generating enough
 cash flow  to pay its current dividend, it does face significant
retroactive payments if Air Canada were to win the arbitration
given how long it has dragged on.”  Chiang lowered his rating on Chorus to the equivalent of a
sell from the equivalent of hold.  Chorus cut its dividend to 7.5 cents from 15 cents as it
reported adjusted net income of 12 cents a share after the close
of trading yesterday. On that basis, profit fell short of the 17
cent average estimate in a Bloomberg survey of five analysts.  “The longer this process continues without resolution, the
larger the amount of any potential retroactive payment,” Chorus
said in its statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
