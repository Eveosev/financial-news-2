JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest
U.S. lender, opposed splitting  Jamie Dimon ’s roles of chairman
and chief executive officer because the change “could be
disruptive.”  The board is made up of  directors  who are all independent
other than Dimon and is led by a “strong” presiding director,
according to a letter sent today by two directors to
stockholders of the New York-based company. The structure
provides “appropriate accountability to our shareholders and
counterbalance to the combined CEO/Chair role,” according to
the letter.  The letter was written by former Exxon Mobil Corp. Chairman
and CEO Lee R. Raymond, the board’s presiding director, and
former Johnson & Johnson Chairman and CEO William C. Weldon, the
chairman of JPMorgan’s corporate governance and nominating
committee.  To contact the reporter on this story:
