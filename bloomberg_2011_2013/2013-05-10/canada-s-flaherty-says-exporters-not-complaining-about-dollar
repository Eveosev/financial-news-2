Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said he
hasn’t heard much concern from exporters about the strength of
the Canada’s currency versus its U.S. counterpart.  “Not really,” Flaherty said, when asked in an interview
with Bloomberg News about whether businesses have expressed
currency worries. “I find that Canadian exporters, business
people, have anticipated the dollar around par and have based
their business plans around that.”  Canada’s dollar has gained 29 percent from its lows during
the 2009 recession, and has averaged about C$1 per greenback, or
parity, over the past two years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Exports, meanwhile, have yet to return to their pre-recession highs. The currency was trading at C$1.0124 at 11:58
a.m. in Toronto.  Flaherty made the comments in Aylesbury near London, where
Group of Seven officials were meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
