Dry weather may persist this week in
areas of  Ukraine , Russia and  Kazakhstan , threatening growth of
winter grains and development of spring crops, MDA Information
Systems LLC said.  Central and eastern Ukraine may be dry this week, with rain
occurring only in southwestern areas, MDA meteorologist Donald Keeney said today in an e-mailed report. Some areas of Ukraine
had less than half the normal amount of rain in the past 45
days. Rain in western  Russia  this week will favor the Volga
Valley while the Central Region and North Caucasus are drier.
Kazakhstan will see showers only in far northern areas.  Temperatures in much of the former Soviet Union probably
will be above normal in the next two weeks, according to the
report. Central and western Ukraine and Russia’s North Caucasus
will be mostly dry from May 17 to 23, while other areas of the
former  Soviet Union  receive 10 millimeters (0.4 inches) to 25
millimeters of rain. Conditions in  Ukraine  and southern and
central Russia may be warmer and drier than normal in June while
areas of Kazakhstan are cooler and wetter.  Russia ranked as the world’s fifth-largest wheat exporter
in the 2012-13 season, according to the  U.S. Department of
Agriculture , followed by Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said yesterday it
expects combined  production  in those countries to jump 40
percent from last year after fields recovered from dry weather
and crops escaped damage from cold temperatures this season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
