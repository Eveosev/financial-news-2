Morgan Stanley re-hired John Collins,
a mergers-and-acquisitions banker who left the firm three years
ago to join Moelis & Co., for a newly created role as global
operations officer for the investment-banking division.  Collins, 45, will start the job in New York in early July,
according to  Mark Lake , a spokesman for the New York-based bank.
He will report to  Mark Eichorn  and  Franck Petitgas , the global
co-heads of investment banking.  Collins first joined Morgan Stanley in 1990 as an analyst
in the firm’s real-estate banking group and spent most of his
career in the mergers-and-acquisitions department, where he was
promoted to managing director in 2004, according to Lake. He
left to join Moelis in April 2010.  Morgan Stanley’s investment-banking division generated $945
million in first-quarter revenue, up 11 percent from a year
earlier, the company reported last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
