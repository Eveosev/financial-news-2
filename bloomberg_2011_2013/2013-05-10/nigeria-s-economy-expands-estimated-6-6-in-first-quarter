The economy of Nigeria,  Africa ’s
largest oil producer, expanded an estimated 6.6 percent in the
first quarter of the year, the central bank said, citing figures
from the National Bureau of Statistics.  Growth in sub-Saharan Africa’s second-largest economy
compared with 6.9 percent in the previous three months, the
Abuja-based bank said in a May 8  report  on its website. It
attributed the slower growth largely “to the decline in the
contribution of the non-oil sector.”  Total government revenue fell 2.4 percent to 2.4 trillion
naira in the period, compared with the previous three months,
according to the report. The federal government’s deficit in the
quarter was 284.8 billion naira ($1.8 billion), or 2.9 percent
of estimated gross domestic product.  Oil receipts of 1.8 trillion naira in the period were 16
percent higher than the budget estimate and 1.4 percent more
than the previous quarter, the bank said. Oil is Nigeria’s main
export, accounting for more than 90 percent of the country’s
foreign currency income. Non-oil receipts fell 13 percent to
575.8 billion naira and were 23 percent below the budget
estimate, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
