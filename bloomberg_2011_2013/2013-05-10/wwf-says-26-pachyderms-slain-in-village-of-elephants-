Kalashnikov-bearing men slaughtered
at least 26 elephants in the Dzanga Bai World Heritage Site in
the Central African Republic on May 6 the WWF said, urging the
country to protect the animals after President Francois Bozize
was overthrown in March.  The 17 gunmen killed the animals in an area known locally
as “village of elephants,” the WWF Central Africa Programme
Office said in an e-mailed statement today. Among the dead at
the site where as many as 200 elephants gather every day were
four calves, the conservation organization said. The gunmen said
they were government forces, the WWF said.  “The killing has started,” Jim Leape, WWF director
general, said in the statement. “The Central African Republic
must act immediately to secure this unique World Heritage
Site.”  In March a group of 50 horsemen from Sudan killed at least
89 elephants in neighboring Chad while 300 were killed in an
attack in Cameroon the year earlier, according to the WWF.  “The events in Dzanga Bai are a vivid reminder of the
existential threat faced by forest elephants in central
Africa,” the WWF said. “Populations of the species have
plummeted 62 percent over the past 10 years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
