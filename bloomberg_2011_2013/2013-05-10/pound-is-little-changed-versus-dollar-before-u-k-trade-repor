The pound was little changed against
the dollar and euro, headed for weekly declines versus both
counterparts, before a report that economists said will show the
U.K.â€™s  trade deficit  narrowed in March.  The pound fell to a two-week low against the U.S. currency.
The goods trade gap shrank to 9 billion pounds ($13.9 billion)
from 9.4 billion pounds in February, the Office for National
Statistics will say today, according to the median estimate of
17 analysts in a Bloomberg News  survey . The Bank of England is
due to release its latest economic analysis and inflation
projections next week after refraining from boosting monetary
stimulus at a policy meeting yesterday.  The pound traded at $1.5437 as of 7:37 a.m. London time,
after touching $1.5418, the lowest since April 25. It has
dropped 0.9 percent this week. Sterling was at 84.47 pence per
euro, down 0.3 percent from May 3.  The pound has strengthened 2 percent in the past month, the
best performer of 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar rose 1.2
percent and the euro gained 1 percent.  U.K. gilts returned 0.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bonds gained 0.7 percent and Treasuries earned 0.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
