Stemcor Holdings Ltd., a London-based
steel trader, hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  to advise it on a
debt refinancing and potential asset sales as the company seeks
to repay a $850 million facility that matured this week,
according to three people with knowledge of matter.  The bank is advising Stemcor as it discusses with lenders a
so-called standstill agreement, said the people, who asked not
to be identified because the negotiations are private. The steel
trader is seeking an agreement to extend and reduce the size of
the debt.  The company reported a loss last year as turnover fell to
about 5 billion pounds ($7.7 billion) from about 6 billion
pounds a year earlier, according to a statement on its  website .
Reduced demand for steel in recession-hit Europe drove down the
prices of  hot-rolled coil , a benchmark steel product, 15 percent
in the past year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Charles Armitstead, a London-based Stemcor spokesman who
works for Pendomer Communications LLP, and Goldman Sachs
spokeswoman  Joanna Carss  declined to comment on the financing or
the bank’s advisory role.  The standstill, under which banks agree not to demand
repayment of the loan for a specified period of time, would also
apply to a one-year $225 million loan raised by Stemcor’s Asian
unit Stemcor SEA Pte Ltd., one of the people said.  Stemcor was founded in 1951 and the majority of its shares
are held by the  Oppenheimer  family, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
