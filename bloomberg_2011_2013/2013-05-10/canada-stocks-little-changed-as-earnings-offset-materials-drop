Canadian  stocks  were little changed,
with the benchmark equity index on track for a third week of
gains, as better-than-forecast corporate results offset a slump
in raw-materials shares.  Magna International Inc., North America’s largest auto-parts maker, added 3.8 percent as earnings beat projections.
Semafo Inc. tumbled 4.3 percent as gold slumped to a two-week
low. TMX Group Ltd., owner of the Toronto Stock Exchange, fell
1.8 percent after saying first-quarter trading volume dropped
and fewer companies sought financings.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index rose 17.77
points, or 0.1 percent, to 12,561.67 at 10:15 a.m. in Toronto.
The benchmark equity gauge has added 1 percent percent this
week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
