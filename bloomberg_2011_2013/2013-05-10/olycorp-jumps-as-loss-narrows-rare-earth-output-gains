Molycorp Inc. , the owner of the
largest rare-earth deposit outside of China, jumped the most
since its July 2010 initial public offering after posting a
smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss as volumes rose.  Molycorp, which climbed as much as 22 percent, rose 20
percent to $6.73 at 10:56 a.m. in New York.  The net loss widened to 33 cents from 7 cents a year
earlier, the Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company said in a
statement after the close of regular trading yesterday.  Excluding inventory writedowns and other one-time items,
the loss was 15 cents, the company said, narrower than the 30-cent average of eight  analystsâ€™ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.
Sales increased 73 percent to $146.4 million, exceeding the
$137.3 million average of six estimates.  Molycorp sold 3,274 metric tons of rare-earth products in
the quarter, up from 958 tons a year earlier. The company
reiterated that its rare-earth complex at Mountain Pass,
California, is scheduled to reach full-scale production in the
middle of the year.  Rare earths are 17 chemically similar metallic elements
used in rechargeable batteries, wind turbines and electric
vehicles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
