The yen will probably stay weaker
than 100 per dollar after falling beyond the key technical level
yesterday for the first time in four years, Deutsche Bank AG’s
 Alan Ruskin  said.  “Prior to this move, we actually saw 100 as quite strong
resistance,” Ruskin, the bank’s New York-based global head of
Group of 10 foreign-exchange strategy, said in a television
interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Sara Eisen. “Now I think 100 is really the support region for
dollar-yen.” Resistance is a level on a chart where sell orders
may be clustered, and support is where buy orders may be found.  Strength in the U.S. currency has also contributed to the
yen’s losses against the dollar, Ruskin said. He recommended
betting the greenback will keep appreciating versus the Japanese
currency, forecasting that the yen will decline to 105 in the
next two months.  The yen slumped 1 percent to 101.62 per dollar as of 12:45
p.m. New York time and reached 101.98, the weakest level since
Oct. 21, 2008.  Japan ’s currency slid 0.4 percent to 131.75 per
euro after reaching 132.26, the least since January 2010.  “These moves are large by any measure,” Ruskin said.
“They’re fast. But I think they’re actually moving in the right
direction with fundamentals.”  BOJ Measures  The Bank of Japan’s measures to stem 15 years of deflation
have the currency headed for its longest streak of monthly
losses in almost two decades. The central bank said April 4 it
would increase its bond purchases to exceed 7 trillion yen ($69
billion) a month, exceeding the 5.2 trillion yen forecast by
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. It also suspended a cap
on some bond holdings and dropped a limit on debt maturities.  The Japanese policy makers maintained the unprecedented
plan at an April 26 meeting and predicted inflation will almost
match their 2 percent target in two years.  The yen has dropped 13 percent this year, the worst
performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. dollar has
gained 3.8 percent, and the New Zealand dollar is the biggest
winner, with a 3.9 percent increase.  To contact the reporter on this story:
