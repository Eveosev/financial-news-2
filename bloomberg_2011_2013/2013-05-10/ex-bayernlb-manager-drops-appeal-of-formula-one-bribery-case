Former Bayerische Landesbank Chief
Risk Officer Gerhard Gribkowsky and Munich prosecutors dropped
appeals against his conviction for bribery,  Germany ’s top
criminal court said.  Gribkowsky was sentenced to 8 years and six months in
prison for accepting bribes to facilitate the sale of the
lender’s stake in Formula One racing to CVC Capital Partners
Ltd. The appeals case is now closed, the Federal Court of
Justice said in an e-mailed statement today.  At his trial, Gribkowsky confessed to accepting $44 million
in bribes from Formula One Chief Executive Officer  Bernie Ecclestone  for agreeing to the 2005 sale to CVC. Ecclestone, who
has said he was blackmailed by Gribkowsky over a tax issue in
the U.K., is being investigated over the issue by Munich
prosecutors.  Gribkowsky’s lawyer, Rainer Bruessow, didn’t immediately
respond to a phone call seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
