Secretary of State  John Kerry  said
recent debate about last Sept. 11’s attack on a U.S. consulate
in Benghazi,  Libya , hasn’t produced new information and
shouldn’t be used for political purposes.  “I hate to see it turned into a pure, prolonged political
process that really doesn’t tell us anything new about the
facts,” Kerry said in an online chat on a Google Inc. website.  The top U.S. diplomat said he respects State Department
officials who “spoke up” at a congressional hearing earlier
this week.  “I really haven’t learned anything new” about events in
Libya that hadn’t been covered in earlier hearings and
briefings, said Kerry, who was a U.S. senator before moving to
the State Department earlier this year.  Kerry praised “four very courageous Americans” who died
in a “terrorist attack” on the Benghazi facility.  “We run risks everywhere in the world,” Kerry said. “But
America can never cower.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
