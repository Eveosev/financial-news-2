Big C Supercenter Pcl (BIGC) , the Thai unit
of  Casino Guichard-Perrachon SA (CO) , slumped the most in nine months
in Bangkok trading after reporting an unexpected drop in first-quarter profit.  Big C, the country’s second-biggest operator of
hypermarkets by number of stores, slid 6.5 percent to 229 baht
at the trading break, poised for biggest decline since July 23.
The stock was the biggest loser in the SET100 Index.  Net income  in the first quarter fell 21 percent from a year
earlier to 1.4 billion baht ($47 million) as higher wages,
utility bills and insurance premiums increased expenses. That
trailed the average  estimate  of 1.84 billion baht profit in a
Bloomberg survey of eight analysts.  “Cost pressures from minimum wage and utilities seem more
prominent than expected,” Kae Pornpunnarath and Ebru Sener
Kurumlu, analysts at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said in a note to
clients today. Decline in gross profit margin “reflects strong
competition in the hypermarket segment and initial cost of
penetrating into a new store format,” they said.  JPMorgan downgraded Big C to neutral, the equivalent of
hold, from overweight, citing  “disappointing” earnings. CIMB
Securities ( Thailand ) Co. Ltd. cut the stock to underperform,
the equivalent of sell, from neutral.  Big C has implemented cost-control measures to mitigate the
increase in operating expenses in 2013, Big C said in a
statement to the stock exchange. The company’s shares have
gained 11 percent this year, trailing a 16 percent increase in
the benchmark SET Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
