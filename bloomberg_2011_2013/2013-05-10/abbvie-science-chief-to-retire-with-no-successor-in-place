AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) ’s long-time head of
research will retire from the drugmaker, leaving the newly spun
off company without a leader for its efforts to develop new
medicines and buttress its future prospects.  Chief Scientific Officer John Leonard, 55, will retire in
the next few months, North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie said
today in regulatory filing. The company didn’t name a successor
to Leonard, who has been with AbbVie and its parent,  Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)  for about 21 years.  The  drug company  has been trying to diversify its products
past Humira, a rheumatoid arthritis injection that sold $9.27
billion last year and made up 50 percent of sales. One top
product, a kidney drug called bardoxolone methyl, failed in
final-stage clinical trials last year. Another treatment for the
viral infection hepatitis C is in the last stage of testing.  Leonard “will be involved in the transition process for
naming his successor,” the company said in the filing. AbbVie
split from Abbott at the beginning of this year in a move to let
each company focus on its core product lines of drugs and
medical devices, respectively.  Jennifer Smoter, a spokeswoman for AbbVie, declined to
elaborate further on Leonard’s departure. “We will announce
future organizational plans at a later date,” she said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
