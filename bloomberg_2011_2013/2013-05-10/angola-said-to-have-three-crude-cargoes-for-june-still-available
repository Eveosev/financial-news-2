Three Angolan crude cargoes for
loading in June, out of 51 lots scheduled for export in that
month, haven’t been sold, according to four traders who
participate in the market.  That’s about normal for this time of the month, the people
said, who asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The unsold consignments comprise one each of
Mondo, Nemba and Pazflor grades, they said. That compares with
one May cargo that was available as of April 12, four traders
said at the time.  The country,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will cut
exports next month to 1.63 million barrels a day, the lowest in
nine months, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News on April 29. That compares with 1.83 million
barrels a day in May and is the least since September when daily
shipments were 1.63 million, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Benchmark Cabinda grade was today 37 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
has averaged a premium of 45 cents so far this month compared
with 55 cents in April, the data show.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  The July schedule for  Angola  will probably be released next
week, the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
