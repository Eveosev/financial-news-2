The number of gas rigs in the U.S.
declined by four this week to 350, according to  Baker Hughes
Inc.  It’s the lowest total since June 1995.  Oil rigs  rose by nine to 1,412, data posted on the
company’s website show.  Total energy rigs  rose by five to 1,769,
the Houston-based field-services company said.  The number of  rigs targeting gas  in the U.S. has declined
for six straight quarters after a combination of horizontal
drilling and hydraulic fracturing triggered a surge in output,
driving gas futures last year to the lowest in a decade. The
price drop has prompted producers to switch to more lucrative
crude and natural-gas liquids plays.  Natural gas for June delivery fell 5.6 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.927 per million British thermal units on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 1:10 p.m. Futures are up 58 percent
from a year ago.  U.S.  gas stockpiles  rose 88 billion cubic feet to 1.865
trillion in the week ended May 3, above the five-year average
gain for that period of 69 billion, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
yesterday.  U.S.  oil output  climbed 0.8 percent to 7.37 million barrels
a day last week, EIA data show. Production reached a two-decade
high of 7.33 million barrels a day on April 19.  Stockpiles  rose
0.1 percent to 395.5 million barrels, the highest in more than
82 years.  Crude for June delivery on the Nymex dropped $1.75, or 1.8
percent, to $94.64 a barrel. The price is down 2.5 percent in
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
