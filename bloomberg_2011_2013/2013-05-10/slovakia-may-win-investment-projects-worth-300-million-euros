Slovakia  may this year win foreign-investment projects worth as much as 300 million euros ($390
million), the government agency for promotion of foreign
investment said.  The agency known as  Sario  has “in the pipeline” five
projects that may create about 3,000 jobs, Director Robert
Simoncic told journalists today in Bratislava, Slovakia.  To fuel the export-dependent economy, the administration of
 Robert Fico  seeks to lure investors with state aid, euro-region
membership and labor costs lower than in the west. Carmakers
such as Volkswagen AG and their suppliers have made Slovakia a
hub for the car industry, helping support the economy as
domestic demand is depressed by unemployment.  The five projects are from companies in the automotive,
health-care, information-technology and leather industries,
Simoncic said. Last year, Slovakia won investment projects worth
466 million euros, set to create 3,228 jobs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
