Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC  said a
federal judge dismissed a patent-infringement case filed against
it by rival  Gevo Inc. , while Gevo said today the dismissal is
temporary and other cases continue.  Butamax, a joint venture of  DuPont Co.  and  BP Plc  based in
Wilmington, Delaware, denies using the patented technology,
Chief Executive Officer  Paul Beckwith  said in a statement today.  Gevo “has agreed to temporarily dismiss its lawsuit”
because Butamax at the present time doesn’t have a chemical
plant in which to infringe, according to a statement from Gevo
Executive Vice President  Brett Lund .  Gevo, based in Englewood, Colorado, is a joint venture to
make specialty chemicals with the oil refiner  Total SA  and
 Lanxess AG .  Claims in the patent suit were dismissed and Gevo can’t
refile the complaint against Butamax “until a final certificate
of reexamination is issued” by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office, wrote U.S. District Judge  Sue L. Robinson  in an order
May 6 in Wilmington.  At least 13 patent cases have been filed by Butamax and
Gevo against each other since 2011, according to court
electronic records.  The case is Gevo v. Butamax, 12-cv-00070, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
