BP Plc bought North Sea Forties crude
at the lowest price in 10 days. Glencore Xstrata Plc sold
Russian Urals blend at a bigger discount to Dated Brent.  One Forties cargo for shipment in May was deferred by three
days, while another for June was advanced by one day, according
to three people with knowledge of the matter.  North Sea  BP purchased  Forties  lot F0520 from Vitol Group for loading
May 25 to May 27 at 35 cents a barrel less than  Dated Brent , the
lowest since April 30, a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. That compares with
a premium of 5 cents for a trade yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Glencore failed to buy Forties for May 28 to June 5 at 8
cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Eni SpA was unable to sell Brent cargo B0504 for May 23 to
May 25 at 10 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to
the survey. This cargo was deferred by five days, said three
people with knowledge of the market.  Glencore also sought to buy Oseberg for June 1 to June 4 at
a premium of 70 cents without success, while Mercuria Energy
Trading SA didn’t manage to buy Oseberg or Ekofisk for June 2 to
June 4 or June 1 to June 7 at 50 cents a barrel more than Dated
Brent, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days fell by 18 cents to a discount of 13 cents a
barrel to Dated Brent.  Brent for June settlement traded at $101.99 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $104.01 yesterday. The July contract was at $101.80 at the
same time today, a discount of 19 cents to June.  Forties consignment F0521 will now load on May 30 to June
1, while cargo F0602 will be exported on June 1 to June 3, said
the people, asking not to be identified because the information
is confidential.  Exports of Troll crude in June will be 14 cargoes, two more
than May, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The June schedule comprises 12 cargoes of 600,000 barrels
each and two lots of 300,000 barrels, the plan showed. It will
total 7.8 million barrels, or 260,000 barrels a day, compared
with 232,258 barrels a day in May, according to the program.  Shipments of Grane for June will be four cargoes of 600,000
barrels each, one less than in May, a loading program showed.  Mediterranean/Urals  Glencore sold 100,000 metric tons of Urals crude for May 20
to May 24 loading to Eni at 90 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, the Platts survey
showed. That compares with a discount of 70 cents for a trade
yesterday, the highest since Dec. 20, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Urals  in the Mediterranean fell by 5 cents to a discount of
4 cents a barrel to Dated Brent after rising to a premium for
the first time since Aug. 20 yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at 68
cents a barrel compared with 52 cents yesterday.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian  Qua Iboe  blend fell by 5 cents to $3.40
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Indian Oil Corp. bought 2 million barrels of July Angolan
Girassol and Nigerian Forcados crudes from Total SA, according
to two people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be
identified because the information is confidential.  Three Angolan crude cargoes for loading in June, out of 51
lots scheduled for export in that month, haven’t been sold,
according to four traders who participate in the market.  That’s about normal for this time of the month, the people
said. The unsold lots comprise one each of Mondo, Nemba and
Pazflor grades, they said. That compares with one May cargo that
was available as of April 12, four traders said at the time.  Nigeria has about 20 cargoes of loading in June available
for sale, out of 66 lots scheduled for export next month,
according to four traders who participate in the market.  That’s more than normal for this stage of the month, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is confidential. The grades remaining include Abo,
Bonny Light, Brass River, EA Blend, Forcados, Okwori,
Pennington, Yoho and at least one of benchmark Qua Iboe crude,
they said. That compares with nine March cargoes still unsold as
of Feb. 7, four traders said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
