U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said a one-time payment from Fannie Mae confirms that the
nation’s debt ceiling won’t be reached until September.  “The one-time payment that Fannie Mae has announced makes
it very clear that we’re not going to hit the effective deadline
until at least Labor Day,” he said in an interview on CNBC
Television in  London  today. “The statutory debt limit will be
reached in just a few days” and “because of the extraordinary
measures that are available and cash flows that we now can
predict it will not be until at least after Labor Day,” which
falls on Sept. 2 this year.  Fannie Mae, the mortgage-financier seized by U.S.
regulators in 2008, said yesterday it will pay the Treasury
$59.4 billion after reporting a record quarterly profit driven
by rising home prices and declining delinquencies.  The U.S. Congress voted at the end of January to suspend
the nation’s $16.4 trillion debt limit through May 18,
temporarily removing the risk of a default. When the ceiling is
restored May 19, it will be increased to reflect the
government’s borrowing during the past few months.  The Treasury Department can continue borrowing for several
months by shifting money among government accounts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
