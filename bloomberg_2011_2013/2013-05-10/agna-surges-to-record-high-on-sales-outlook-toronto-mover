Magna International Inc. , North
America’s largest auto-parts maker, soared to a record after
raising its 2013 sales forecasts and posting earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Magna  climbed 3.9 percent to C$65.67 at 11:32 a.m. in
Toronto, after reaching C$66.45, the highest since at least
September 1988, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Earlier, the Aurora, Ontario-based company rose as much as 5.1
percent.  “European margins look like the biggest positive area,”
 David Tyerman , a Toronto-based analyst at Canaccord Financial
Inc, said in a research note today. “This is a very strong
performance given the weakness in the European auto industry.”  Tyerman, who rates Magna a buy with a $64 target, said that
may reflect Magna’s exposure to stronger companies such as
Daimler AG, maker of Mercedes-Benz, Bayerische Motoren Werke AG
and Volkswagen AG.  Magna raised its 2013 revenue expectations to $32.6 billion
to $34 billion, compared with an earlier forecast of $32 billion
to $33.4 billion in March. Magna now expects its operating
margin will be in the mid-to-high 5 percent range, compared with
earlier estimates of mid 5 percent.  Magna reported first-quarter net income of $1.57 a share
compared with $1.46 a year earlier and ahead of the $1.45
average of nine estimates  compiled  by Bloomberg. Sales rose 9.1
percent to a record $8.36 billion from the year-ago quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
