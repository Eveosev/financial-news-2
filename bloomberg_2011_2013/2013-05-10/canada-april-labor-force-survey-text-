Following is the text of  Canada ’s
labor force survey released by  Statistics Canada .  Following a decline the previous month, employment was
little changed in April and the unemployment rate remained at
7.2%.  Compared with 12 months earlier, employment increased 0.9%
or 163,000, all in full time. The total number of hours worked
rose by 1.5% over the same period.  Provincially, employment grew in  Alberta , while it fell in
Manitoba,  New Brunswick  and Newfoundland and Labrador.  In April, there were employment gains in manufacturing and
public administration. These gains were offset by losses in
transportation and warehousing; “other services”; and business,
building and other support services.  There were 34,000 more people working in the public sector
in April, while there was little change in the number of private
sector employees and the self-employed.  Over the previous 12 months, public sector employment
increased 2.6% or 94,000, while growth in self-employment was
2.2% (+59,000), the bulk of which was in the first quarter of
2013. The number of private sector employees was little changed
compared with 12 months earlier, as gains in the second half of
2012 were offset by losses in 2013.  Employment in April increased among people aged 25 to 54
and declined among youths. For people aged 55 and over,
employment was little changed.  Employment up in Alberta  Employment in Alberta increased by 15,000 in April,
offsetting the loss in the previous month and pushing the
 unemployment rate  down 0.4 percentage points to 4.4%. Compared
with 12 months earlier, employment in Alberta grew by 1.9%.  In Manitoba, employment declined by 11,000 in April,
pushing the unemployment rate up 0.8 percentage points to 5.8%.
With this decline, employment returned to a level similar to
that of 12 months earlier.  Employment in New Brunswick fell by 3,200 and the
unemployment rate was 10.9%. Compared with 12 months earlier,
employment in the province was little changed.  Following three months of little change, employment in
Newfoundland and Labrador declined by 3,000 in April and the
unemployment rate was 12.4%. This decline brought employment
back to its level of 12 months earlier.  Employment in Ontario was little changed in April, and the
unemployment rate remained at 7.7%. On a year-over-year basis,
employment growth in this province was 1.0%, with the bulk of
the gains in the fall of 2012.  Following a decline in March, employment in  Quebec  was
little changed in April and the unemployment rate was 7.8%.
Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in the province rose
1.1%, with most of the growth from August to November 2012.  Industry perspective  Employment in manufacturing increased by 21,000 in April,
the first monthly gain following a downward trend that began in
June 2012. Employment in this industry was down 2.9% or 52,000
from 12 months earlier.  In April, the number of employees in public administration
grew by 13,000. Compared with 12 months earlier, employment in
this industry was up 2.6% or 25,000, all in provincial and local
public administration.  There were 21,000 fewer people working in transportation
and warehousing, bringing employment in this industry back to
its level of 12 months earlier.  Employment in “other services”, such as repair and
maintenance or personal and household services, continued its
year-long downward trend, declining by 19,000 in April. On a
year-over-year basis, total employment has fallen by 7.3% in
this industry.  The number of workers in business, building and other
support services decreased by 16,000 in April, bringing
employment back to a level similar to that of 12 months earlier.  Employment increases among people aged 25 to 54  In April, there were 31,000 more people aged 25 to 54
working, mostly men. With this gain, the unemployment rate for
this age group fell 0.3 percentage points to 5.8%. On a year-over-year basis, total employment gains were 69,000 (+0.6%).  Among youths aged 15 to 24, employment declined by 19,000
in April, and the unemployment rate was 14.5%. Compared with 12
months earlier, youth employment was little changed.  Employment among people aged 55 and over was little changed
in April. However, with more people in this age group searching
for work, the unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage points to
6.1%. Over the 12 months to April, employment for this group was
up 111,000 (+3.5%), primarily a result of population ageing.  Note to readers  The Labour Force Survey (LFS) estimates are based on a
sample and are therefore subject to sampling variability. As a
result, monthly estimates will show more variability than trends
observed over longer time periods. Estimates for smaller
geographic areas or industries also have more variability. For
an explanation of sampling variability of estimates and how to
use standard errors to assess this variability, consult the
“Estimates quality” section of the publication Labour Force
Information (71-001-X).  The employment rate is the number of employed persons as a
percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The rate
for a particular group (for example, youth aged 15 to 24) is the
number employed in that group as a percentage of the population
for that group.  The unemployment rate is the number unemployed as a
percentage of the labour force (employed and unemployed).  The participation rate is the number of employed and
unemployed as a percentage of the population. For more detailed
information, see the Guide to the Labour Force Survey (71-543-G).  Unless otherwise stated, this release presents seasonally
adjusted estimates, which facilitates comparisons by removing
the effects of seasonal variations. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/bsolc/olc-cel/colc-cel?catno=11-010-X201000311141&amp;lang=fra ) .  Each year, the LFS revises its estimates for the previous
three years, using the latest seasonal factors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
