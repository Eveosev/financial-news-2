Treasuries fell, with 10-year note
yields climbing to the highest level in six weeks, as signs the
U.S. economy is improving amid central-bank monetary stimulus
sapped demand for U.S. debt.  Benchmark yields were set for their biggest weekly increase
in two months as the dollar continued to rally versus the yen
after passing the 100 level yesterday. The Fed and other central
banks are pumping cash into their economies or cutting interest
rates, prompting money managers to seek higher-yielding assets.
Pacific Investment Management Co.’s  Bill Gross  wrote in a
message on Twitter that the 30-year bull market for bonds
“likely ended” on April 29. Treasury trading volume rose to
the highest level since February.  “We are seeing the ramifications of the yen move that had
the effect of exacerbating the already short-dollar position on
the street,”  Richard Gilhooly , an interest-rate strategist at
Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities unit in New York. “The
move is causing trouble for a bond market that is getting longer
as the duration is increasing during the selloff.” A long
position is a bet that an asset will increase in value.  The U.S. 10-year  yield  climbed nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 1.9 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York, after
touching 1.93 percent, the highest since March 26, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent note due in May
2023 fell 25/32, or $7.81 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 21/32.  Weekly Gain  The yield has climbed 16 basis points  this week , the most
since the period ended March 8. It traded above its 50-, 100-and
200-day moving averages for the first time since March 25.  The  yield  on the 30-year bond rose nine basis points to
3.09 percent after touching 3.13 percent, the highest level
since April 1.  Trading volume increased 36 percent to $450 billion,
according to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S.
government debt. It was the highest level since Feb. 1. The
average daily volume for this year is $281 billion.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their net-long position in 10-year note  futures  in the week
ending May 7, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data.  Speculative long positions or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 37,956 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Net-long positions fell by 94,088 contracts, or
71 percent, from a week earlier, resulting in the biggest
reduction in net longs since March.  Market Levels  Treasuries due in a decade or more are close to the
cheapest levels in a month relative to global peers with
comparable maturities, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. Yields on Treasuries were 49 basis points higher
than those in an index of other sovereign debt yesterday, just
below the 52 basis points reached on May 6, the cheapest level
since April 4. As recently as March 25, the gap was at 57 basis
points, the cheapest level since August 2011.  “Treasuries remain cheaper because of the risk-on
sentiment,” said Jim Vogel, head of agency-debt research at FTN
Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee . “All the rate cuts are
supposed to suppress volatility. The move is so tied to central
bank policy that it is supposed to be low.”  Government bonds in Japan,  Germany  and the U.K. slumped and
the yen weakened beyond 100 per dollar for the first time in
four years. The yen depreciated as much as 1.4 percent to 101.98
per dollar, the weakest since October 2008.  Japan’s Investors  Domestic investors in Japan became buyers of bonds outside
the nation after the longest period of sales in three years.  Money managers  boosted their holdings  of overseas bonds and
notes by 514.3 billion yen ($5.1 billion) in the two weeks ended
May 3, the Ministry of Finance said today. They had cut them in
the six weeks through April 19, the longest run since January
2010.  The central bank purchased $1.4 billion of Treasuries
maturing between February 2036 and February 2043 today,
according to the Fed Bank of New York’s website.  Fed purchases have suppressed volatility. Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index measuring price swings in Treasuries
rose to 55.32 basis points, after falling yesterday to an all-time low of 48.87 basis points. The measure averaged 62.6 basis
points during the past 12 months.  The U.S. central bank is buying Treasuries and mortgage
debt each month to support the economy by capping borrowing
costs. The Bank of  Japan  is purchasing more than 7 trillion yen
of debt each month in expanded easing measures announced April
4.  Economic Data  The number of Americans filing claims for jobless benefits
unexpectedly dropped last week and the average over the past
month fell to the lowest level since before the last recession,
the Labor Department said yesterday.  Even as the economy recovers, bond market measures from
overnight index swaps projects the federal funds rate, won’t
climb past 50 basis points until January 2016. The fed funds
 effective rate  was at 0.13 percent today. The Fed has kept the
overnight interbank lending rate at zero to 0.25 percent since
December 2008.  Treasuries slid 0.5 percent this month through yesterday,
