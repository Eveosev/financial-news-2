Mozambique ’s central bank kept its
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 9.5 percent for a sixth
straight month.  The monetary policy committee maintained the rate “to help
mitigate the impact of exogenous shocks that affected the
performance of the country’s main macronomic indicators in
recent months,” the Maputo-based Banco de Mocambique said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Mozambique cut the rate by 550 basis points last year to
stimulate the economy as inflation slowed. The annual inflation
rate rose for a fourth month in April, climbing to 4.8 percent
from 4.3 percent in the previous month, the statistics agency
said on May 3.  Food prices climbed after floods hit the southern and
central provinces of the country in January and February,
curbing output. At least 69 people were killed and 112,000 were
displaced, according to the National Distaster Management
Institute.  The MPC left the deposit rate at 2.25 percent and
maintained the level of reserves that commercial lenders must
hold with the bank at 8 percent, according to the statement. The
bank will make its next rate decision on June 10.  The southern African nation is site of the world’s largest
discovery of natural gas in the past decade.  To contact the reporters on this story:
