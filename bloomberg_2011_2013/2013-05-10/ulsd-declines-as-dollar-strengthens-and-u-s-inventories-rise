heating oil and diesel, rose 1.6 percent last week and

now,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures

into high gear for refining in the U.S.”  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for June delivery fell 5.91 cents,

shared currency since April 24, helping push the Standard &
Poor’s  GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 materials down 1.4 percent at 9:36 a.m.  “We don’t have a strong fundamental picture and when the
dollar rallies, the market doesn’t have enough positive economic
sentiment to get another leg up on its rally,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Gasoline Slips  Gasoline for June delivery fell 4.51 cents, or 1.6 percent,
