Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , continental
Europe’s biggest bank, plans to open a sales office in Ghana as
part of its African expansion.  “Deutsche Bank is now looking at its African strategy and
questions around how to include countries like Kenya,” Charles
Weller, the bank’s Nigeria country head, said in an interview at
the World Economic Forum in Cape Town yesterday. Ghana “could
possibly dovetail into the Nigerian operations,” he said.  Deutsche Bank is focusing on international payments and
trade finance in West Africa, Weller said, adding that the
Frankfurt-based lender is also considering asset management and
 wealth management  in Nigeria.  Deutsche Bank, which has an office in Johannesburg, is
joining lenders, including  Barclays Plc (BARC)  and Citigroup Inc., in
building a presence in  Africa  as the continent of one billion
people reports economic growth rates of more than 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
