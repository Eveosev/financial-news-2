The U.K. postponed its mass
installation of “smart” energy meters by a year as suppliers
struggle with design glitches and testing is delayed.  The full-scale release of more than 50 million meters to
about 30 million homes and businesses will now run from the fall
of 2015 to the end of 2020, Energy and Climate Change Secretary
 Ed Davey  said today in a  statement  to parliament. The government
previously planned to install the units from 2014 through 2019.  The rollout is a “complex task, which must be fulfilled
with great care to ensure consumers receive the best possible
benefits,” Angela Knight, chief executive officer of the  Energy
U.K.  lobby group, said today in an e-mailed statement.
“Allocating extra time to the program will mean that it can be
completed in a more efficient and cost-effective manner.”  The program is aimed at cutting energy use, emissions and
consumer bills by providing users with instantaneous information
on the power consumption of appliances through computerized
meters. Utilities including  Electricite de France SA (EDF) , EON SE,
 SSE Plc (SSE) ,  Centrica Plc (CNA) ,  RWE AG (RWE) ’s Npower unit and  Iberdrola SA (IBE) ’s
Scottish Power division will be required to install them in
customers’ homes, and can recoup the costs through bills.  “Completing the national rollout will be an enormous
logistical and technical challenge for the industry,” Davey
said in today’s statement, without detailing the setbacks facing
the suppliers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
