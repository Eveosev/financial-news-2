The yield on  Vietnam ’s three-year
bonds fell by the most in almost three weeks after the central
bank said it will lower  interest rates  to boost economic growth.
The dong gained.  State Bank  of Vietnam will cut the refinancing rate by 1
percentage point to 7 percent effective May 13 and reduce the
discount rate to 5 percent from 6 percent, Deputy Governor
Nguyen Dong Tien said at a briefing in Hanoi today. Vietnam’s
economy expanded 5.03 percent last year, the least since 1999.  “Yields will probably go down in the primary and secondary
markets following the rate cut,” said Nguyen Thanh Danh, a Ho
Chi Minh City-based money-market dealer at Saigon Thuong Tin
Commercial Joint-Stock Bank. “There’s a lot of demand for bonds
as credit growth is still slow.”  The yield dropped five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 7.75 percent, the biggest decline since April 22,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
The rate fell eight basis points this week, the most in a month.  Credit increased 1.4 percent as of April 23 from the end of
2012, Thoi Bao Ngan Hang, a central bank publication, reported
May 6. The country is targeting 12 percent loan growth this year.  The dong advanced 0.1 percent to 20,935 per dollar as of
3:15 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the  reference rate  at 20,828 today, unchanged
since December 2011, according to its website. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
