Nigeria is targeting $10 billion of
investment in farming to boost domestic food production by 2015,
as  Africa ’s most-populous nation seeks to reduce a reliance on
imports, Agriculture Minister Akinwunmi Adesina said.  The government is working with the central bank to
“unlock” $3.5 billion in funding from commercial banks for
farmers, Adesina said in an interview today in Cape Town. So
far, $8 billion in private investment commitments in agriculture
have been arranged by President Goodluck Jonathan’s
administration, he said.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, is trying to reverse a
decline in its farming industry. The nation of more than 160
million people plans to boost food supply by 20 million metric
tons by 2015. While Nigeria grew enough food to feed itself in
the 1960s, it is now the world’s largest importer of rice and
sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest importer of wheat and sugar.  Food production rose by about 8 million tons in 2012, about
40 percent of the four-year objective, “which was 70 percent
above the target that we set for ourselves last year,” Adesina
said.  Nigeria expects to produce more than the 3.2 million tons
of rice it needs to become self-sufficient by next year, Adesina
said. The country exported 3 million tons of dry cassava chips
last year, exceeding a target to export 900,000 metric tons to
 China  by 2015, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
