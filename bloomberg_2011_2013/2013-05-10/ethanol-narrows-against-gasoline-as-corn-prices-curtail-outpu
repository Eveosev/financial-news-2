Ethanol narrowed against gasoline as
higher corn prices sent production rates to record lows for this
time of year.  The spread, or price difference, shrank by 3.17 cents to
22.64 cents a gallon at 10:28 a.m. New York time after ethanol
 production  dropped 12 percent from a record 963,000 barrels a
day in December 2011, according to the Energy Information
Administration data. Corn stockpiles on Aug. 31, before this
year’s harvest, will be the lowest relative to consumption since
1995, Agriculture Department data show.  “Production has been low and corn’s been hanging in there,
too,” said Joshua Bailer, managing director of Next Generation
Commodities, the biofuels division of Atlas Commodities LLC, in
Miami. “With corn prices where they are, it makes sense.”  Denatured ethanol for June delivery fell 1.8 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.609 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 23 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery tumbled 4.97 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.8354 a gallon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Supply Report  The USDA plans to release its World Agricultural Supply and
Demand Estimates today at noon in  Washington .  Ethanol companies across the corn-rich U.S. Midwest
shuttered operations or tempered output after drought last
summer reduced yields for the grain and skyrocketed costs to
make the biofuel.  Corn for July delivery slid 5.75 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$6.43 a bushel in Chicago.  The corn crush spread for July was 15 cents a gallon, up
from 14 cents yesterday and minus 35 cents on Dec. 31. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Ethanol is blended with gasoline to meet federal mandates.
Compliance with the law is tracked by Renewable Identification
Numbers, or RINs, certificates attached to each gallon of
biofuel. Refiners can keep the RINs to show adherence to the law
or they can trade them.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  were unchanged at 80.5 cents as of
8:27 a.m. in New York, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Advanced
RINs, which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based
ethanol gained 1.6 percent to 94.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
