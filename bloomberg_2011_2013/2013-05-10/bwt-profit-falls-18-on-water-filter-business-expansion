BWT AG (BWT) , an Austrian maker of water-purification equipment, said first-quarter net income fell
almost 18 percent to 3.6 million euros from a year earlier as
the company expanded in the water-filter business.  BWT’s growth in water filters for end customers required
higher spending on employees and production, spokesman Ralf Burchert said today in a telephone interview. Cost increases and
a “difficult” situation in southern Europe means profit won’t
rise this year even though BWT is targeting slightly higher
sales, it said in a statement.  Revenue increased 0.6 percent to 119.8 million euros in the
three months ended March, BWT said. Shares of the Mondsee,
Austria-based company have risen almost 20 percent over the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
