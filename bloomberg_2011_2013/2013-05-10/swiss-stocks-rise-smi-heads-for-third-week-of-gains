Stocks in Switzerland  rose for a
third day, extending a five-year high for the Swiss Market
Index, as  Novartis AG (NOVN)  and banks rallied.  Novartis AG jumped to a six-year high after saying U.S.
authorities approved the drugmaker’s Ilaris treatment for
childhood arthritis.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  advanced 1.9
percent, pacing gains among European banks.  ABB Ltd. (ABBN) , the
world’s biggest supplier of power grids, lost 1.2 percent after
saying said Chief Executive Officer Joe Hogan will quit.  The SMI added 0.8 percent to 8,155.89 at 10:04 a.m. in
Zurich, its highest level since January 2008. The gauge is
heading for its third weekly increase as companies reported
better-than-forecast earnings and Chinese trade data beat
estimates. The SMI has rallied 20 percent so far this year. The
broader Swiss Performance Index rose 0.9 percent today.  The volume of shares changing hands in SMI-listed companies
was more than double the average of the past 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
