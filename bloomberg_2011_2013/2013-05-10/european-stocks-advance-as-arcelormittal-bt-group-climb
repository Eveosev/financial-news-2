European stocks gained, extending the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index’s highest level since June 2008, as
companies including  ArcelorMittal (MT)  and BT Group Plc posted
better-than-expected results and German exports increased in
March. U.S. index futures and most Asian shares advanced.  ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, climbed the
most in almost eight months. BT jumped to its highest price

power transformers said its chief executive officer resigned.  The Stoxx 600 added 0.5 percent to 305.22 at 10:51 a.m. in

as companies posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings and
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said policy makers
are ready to cut  interest rates  if needed.  “There are still good reasons for markets to be happy,”
said Pierre Mouton, who helps oversee $6 billion as a portfolio
manager at Notz, Stucki & Cie. in Geneva. “It starts with the
U.S. where even though we had a soft patch, expansion is
confirmed and employment improves continually. While German
imports came in lower than expected, investors may be relieved
the numbers weren’t as bad as in the previous month. The ECB’s
commitment to ensure that no disruption happens on the banking
side in Europe has given renewed confidence to investors.”  The volume of shares changing hands in Stoxx 600 companies
was 23 percent greater than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Stocks  Contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2
percent. The U.S. benchmark gauge retreated yesterday, following
five successive records for the index, as Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia President  Charles Plosser  said he favors scaling
back the central banks’ pace of stimulus. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index dropped 0.2 percent, while about two stocks rose for each
one that fell.  German exports rose in March, adding to signs that Europe’s
largest economy is starting to recover from a contraction at the
end of last year.  Exports, adjusted for working days and seasonal changes,
advanced 0.5 percent from February, when they dropped 1.2
percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said. The
increase matched the median forecast of 16 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Imports rose 0.8 percent from February,
missing the 1.5 percent gain economists had predicted.  ArcelorMittal Beats  ArcelorMittal jumped 6.3 percent to 10.31 euros. Earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell to
$1.57 billion in the first three months of the year from $2.12
billion a year earlier, ArcelorMittal said. That beat the $1.32
billion median estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  BT (BT/A)  surged 12 percent to 309 pence. The U.K.’s largest
fixed-line phone company reported fourth-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as it added more customers to its high-speed  Internet service  to compensate for declining landlines.  Adjusted Ebitda rose 4 percent to 1.67 billion pounds
($2.58 billion) in the quarter ending in March. Analysts had
projected 1.62 billion pounds in a Bloomberg survey.  Generali added 1.7 percent to 14.77 euros, its highest
price since July 2011, after saying first-quarter profit rose
6.3 percent as earnings at its non-life insurance business
increased. Net income in the three months to March climbed to
603 million euros ($786 million) from 567 million euros a year
earlier, the Italian company said. That beat the 561.4 million-euro average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  ABB CEO  ABB (ABBN)  lost 1.3 percent to 21.27 Swiss francs after announcing
that CEO Joe Hogan will leave the company for private reasons.

replacement is appointed.  International Consolidated Airlines Group SA (IAG)  declined 3.6
percent to 270.4 pence. The parent of British Airways said its
first-quarter loss widened on currency fluctuations, and it took
a 311 million-euro charge against job cuts at Spanish unit
Iberia. IAG posted an operating loss of 278 million euros,
excluding one-time items. Analysts had predicted a loss of 250
million euros.  Gemalto NV (GTO)  dropped 4.1 percent to 57.70 euros, posting the
worst performance on the Stoxx 600, after Morgan Stanley said
expectations for the smart card maker to report organic growth
of 9 percent to 12 percent in 2013 to 2015 are too high, given
that it reported estimated organic growth of 3.5 percent in the
last five years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
