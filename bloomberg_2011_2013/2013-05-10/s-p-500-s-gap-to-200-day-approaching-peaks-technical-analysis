The rally in U.S. stocks has driven
the distance between the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and its
200-day average toward peak levels that have coincided with the
start of the biggest annual retreats in the last three years.  The benchmark gauge of American equities climbed to a
record 1,632.69 on May 8, 11.2 percent above its average price
in the past 200 days. That was the widest gap since April 2012,
when the index started a 9.9 percent slide through June 1, the
worst drop of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In 2010 and 2011, the  biggest declines  each year began with the
 S&P 500  trading more than 11.7 percent above its 200-day
average, the data show.  The gap “speaks to the velocity and steepness of the
current rally,” Joshua Dollinger, chief technical strategist at
BTIG LLC in  New York , said in a phone interview yesterday. “And
you never want to go too far, too fast. You could need a little
digestion to play catch up.”  The S&P 500 has climbed 14 percent this year as the index
posted the sixth consecutive  monthly increase  in April, the
longest streak since 2009. The share gains have kept the
benchmark above its 200-day average for 118 days going back to
Nov. 16, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The stock market may avoid past slumps that have been
accompanied by the S&P 500’s rise above its 200-day average
because the rally to all-time highs showed momentum is building,
according to  Katie Stockton , chief market technician at
 Stamford , Connecticut-based MKM Partners.  ‘More Extreme’  “If momentum is strong, as it is now, this condition can
be sustained or get even more extreme,” Stockton wrote in an e-mail yesterday. “It doesn’t mean the market won’t pull back,
just perhaps from a higher level.”  The S&P 500 rose above its 200-day trend line during the
initial stages of the  bull market , with the gap at least 12
percent most of the time during the six months that started in
July 2009. The moving average reached 20.6 percent higher than
the index in October that year, the data show.  The  bull market  in U.S. equities is in its fifth year as
the S&P 500 surged 140 percent from its bottom in 2009, driven
by better-than-expected corporate earnings and an unprecedented
three rounds of bond purchases by the  Federal Reserve  to
stimulate the economy.  Last year, the index strayed 11.9 percent above the average
before its worst slump began. The index was 11.8 percent above
its average when it reached its 2011 high on April 29. It then
tumbled 19 percent through Oct. 3. In 2010, the gap was 12.4
percent on April 23 when the index started a 16 percent drop
through July 2, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “It certainly is concerning when looking to add new long
positions at current levels,” Jonathan Krinsky, chief technical
analyst at Miller Tabak & Co., said in an interview yesterday.
“2013 is either at the end of a short secular  bear market , or
the beginning of a new secular bull. In our view, it is too
early to make that call at this juncture.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
