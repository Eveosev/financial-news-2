Cambium Networks is finding there is life after Motorola, in Asia. Wireless broadband equipment maker Cambium was spun off from Motorola Solutions in 2011 in a sale to San Francisco-based private equity firm Vector Capital. After taking over as Cambium's chief executive officer in February, Atul Bhatnagar travelled to India and China this week and liked what he saw.  The penetration of smartphones into huge rural populations of the two countries means Cambium can triple its portion of sales from Asia to 30 percent in the next three years, from 10 percent now, Bhatnagar said in an interview today. Bhatnagar will be back in Asia to visit other countries in two months as he looks to build on the legacy from Motorola Solutions with new products. “We have kept the best and we're inventing the rest,'” Bhatnagar said. “When it comes to quality, we have kept our DNA. We are accelerating the pace at which we bring out new products. The velocity of innovation has increased quite a bit.” To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Edmond Lococo in Beijing at elococo@bloomberg.net
