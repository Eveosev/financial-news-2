Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502) ,  Asia ’s
largest drugmaker, fell the most in more than four years in
Tokyo trading after full-year operating profit missed its own
forecast and analyst estimates.  Takeda  declined  as much as 9.6 percent to 4,790 yen, headed
for the biggest drop since March 2009, before trading at 4,950
yen as of the mid-day trading break in Tokyo. The benchmark
Topix Index advanced 2.2 percent.  Operating profit, sales minus cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, for the year ended March 31 plunged 54
percent from a year earlier to 122.5 billion yen ($1.2 billion)
due to a cost increase, Takeda said yesterday. That compared
with the company’s forecast of 160 billion yen made in February
and the 171.3 billion yen average of 17 analysts  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Expenses from overseas operations increased more than
expected in the fourth quarter as corporate management failed to
understand the spending trend by the operational side, Chief
Executive Officer  Yasuchika Hasegawa  said in a briefing
yesterday. Brokerages including Nomura Holdings Inc., Barclays
Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG said the earnings will have a
negative impact on the share price.  “Takeda is too loose in managing figures,” Ryoichi Urushihara, a health-care analyst at Nomura in Tokyo, said in a
note to clients dated yesterday. “It was a poor earnings
result.”  Operating profit this fiscal year is expected to be 140
billion yen, 38 percent lower than Takeda’s previous forecast of
225 billion yen made in May last year, on the impact of
recalling its anemia treatment Omontys and competition from
generic drugs, the company said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
