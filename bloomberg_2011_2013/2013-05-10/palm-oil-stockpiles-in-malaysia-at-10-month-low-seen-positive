Palm oil stockpiles in  Malaysia , the
world’s second-largest producer, fell the most in more than two
years to a 10-month low in April as exports outpaced production,
according to official data.  Inventories dropped 11 percent to 1.93 million metric tons
last month from 2.17 million tons in March, the lowest level
since June, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said today. This was
less than the median estimate of 2.06 million tons in a
Bloomberg survey. Output climbed 3.1 percent to 1.37 million
tons, while  exports  dropped 5.6 percent to 1.45 million tons,
the board said.  “It’s encouraging, but in China and India, inventories are
still high,” said  Ben Santoso , an analyst at DBS Vickers
Securities Pte in  Singapore . Prices will not recover as much as
expected, he said.  Stockpiles may continue to decline in May to 1.89 million
tons and increase in June to 1.96 million tons, before moving
back above 2 million tons in the second half of the year as
production increases, Santoso said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
