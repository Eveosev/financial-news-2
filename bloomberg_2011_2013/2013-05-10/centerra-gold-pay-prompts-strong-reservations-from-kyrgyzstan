Kyrgyzaltyn JSC, the Kyrgyzstan-controlled company that’s  Centerra Gold Inc. ’s largest
shareholder, said it’s “concerned” about the Canadian gold
producer’s performance and management.  Kyrgyzaltyn has “strong reservations” about Centerra’s
proposed compensation for senior management, said Kylychbek
Shakirov, deputy chairman of Kyrgyzaltyn’s management board on
economics and finance. He commented today at Centerra’s annual
shareholder meeting in Toronto.  Kyrgyzaltyn is also concerned about a proposal to reappoint
KPMG as auditors of the company and that management renominated
 Bruce Walter  as a director, he said.  Kyrgyzaltyn has a 33 percent stake in Centerra, which owns
the Kumtor mine in Kyrgyzstan. Toronto-based Centerra is in
negotiations with the government on ways to address concerns
raised in a report by a state commission regarding taxes and
ownership issues around the project, Chief Executive Officer  Ian Atkinson  said yesterday in an interview. The company isn’t
prepared to reopen the 2009 agreement, he said.  Kyrgyzstan has no wish to nationalize Kumtor, Shakirov said
today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
