The U.S. has put its military forces
in  Europe  on alert in case they’re required to respond to a
security crisis stemming from political unrest in  Libya ,
according to a U.S. defense official.  Several teams of military personnel assigned to the U.S.
Africa Command and based in Stuttgart, Germany, have been put on
notice and can reach parts of Libya quickly because they’re
equipped with their own air transport, said the official, who
asked not to be identified because he wasn’t authorized to
discuss the plans.  The U.S. has no imminent plans to deploy the forces to
Libya, the defense official said.  The quick reaction forces were created in the aftermath of
the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi in
which Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were
killed.  Libyan militias that have blockaded the country’s foreign
ministry for almost two weeks fled today after thousands of pro-government protesters converged on the building. U.S. and
British embassies in the Libyan capital Tripoli withdrew some
staff and issued travel warnings.  People blockading government ministries were protesting a
May 5 law that requires the dismissal from office of senior
officials who served in the government of deceased dictator
 Muammar Qaddafi .  The  Associated Press  reported the Pentagon putting its
forces in Europe on alert.  To contact the reporter on this story:
