Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said
Michael Dell would lose his job as head of  Dell Inc. (DELL)  if
shareholders accept an offer for the computer maker outlined by
Icahn.  Dell needs “cultural change” and Michael Dell isn’t the
person to implement that, Icahn said today in an interview with
 Trish Regan  on Bloomberg Television.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
