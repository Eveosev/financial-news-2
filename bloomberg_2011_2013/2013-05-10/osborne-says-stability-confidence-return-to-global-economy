U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said stability and confidence have returned to
the global economy but Group of Seven finance ministers have
“much more to do.”  “The good news is that some stability and confidence has
come back into the global economy but we have got much more to
do, and for Britain, as we have seen in the last few years, we
are very affected by what happens in our neighbors,” Osborne
told reporters as he arrived for two days of talks with his G-7
counterparts outside  London  today. “I am absolutely determined
to focus on nurturing the recovery and not taking it for
granted, and that is what we are going to do here today.”  Osborne sidestepped a question on whether the government
would make money available to strengthen Co-Operative Bank Plc
after Moody’s Investors Service cut the lender’s rating to junk
status, citing a capital shortfall.  “The Co-Op have put out a statement last night about how
they are going strengthen their capital position,” Osborne
said. “Those plans, like the plans of any bank, will be
supervised by our new independent PRA, the  Prudential Regulatory
Authority .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
