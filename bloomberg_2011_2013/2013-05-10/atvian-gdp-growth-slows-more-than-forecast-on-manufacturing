Latvia’s  economy  expanded at the
slowest pace in more than two years in the first quarter as
manufacturing contracted.  Gross domestic product grew a preliminary 3.1 percent from
a year earlier, compared with a 5.1 percent advance in the
fourth quarter, the  statistics office , based in the capital,
Riga, said today by e-mail. That’s less than the 3.7 percent
median estimate of seven economists in a Bloomberg survey. GDP
rose 1.2 percent from the previous quarter.  The Baltic country’s economy recorded growth of more than 5
percent for a second year in 2012 after the world’s deepest
recession in 2008-2009 erased almost a quarter of GDP. Expansion
will slow to 3.8 percent this year and 4.1 percent in 2014,
according to European Commission.  Retail trade grew 6 percent from a year earlier between
January and March, while construction expanded 9 percent,
according to the statistics office. Manufacturing contracted 5
percent, it said. Detailed GDP data are scheduled for release
June 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
