Shipments of refined oil products
including  diesel  and gasoil to Europe from the U.S. Gulf Coast
are poised to reach the highest level since January, a Bloomberg
News survey showed.  Traders will charter 11 Medium Range tankers for loading
over the two weeks to May 22, the average estimates of five
shipbrokers specializing in the trade showed yesterday and
today. That’s two more ships than last week’s corresponding
survey and the highest tally since Jan. 17. Each vessel normally
carries about 38,000 metric tons.  The survey is based on the Houston-to-Amsterdam route, a
benchmark for the trade that takes about 17 days at 12.5 knots,
according to the sea-distances.com website. Costs to haul
refined products to Europe climbed 13 percent this month to 85
industry-standard Worldscale points, according to the Baltic
Exchange in London.  Seven of the projected bookings have been arranged and the
rest are anticipated, the latest survey showed. Twenty-five
tankers will be seeking cargoes, five fewer than last week,
according to the shipbrokers.  The table below details numbers of ships booked, likely to
be hired and available for charter for the two weeks from the
stated dates.  *T                             May 8       May 1   Change
