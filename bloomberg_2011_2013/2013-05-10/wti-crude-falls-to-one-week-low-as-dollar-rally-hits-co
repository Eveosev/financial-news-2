West Texas Intermediate crude fell
for a second day as the dollar climbed, reducing the appeal of
raw materials priced in the U.S. currency.  Futures declined 0.4 percent as the Dollar Index advanced
above 83 for the first time in more than two weeks. Gold dropped
2.2 percent. The 12 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries bolstered oil output last month, a report
from the group’s Vienna-based secretariat showed. OPEC’s demand
forecast was little changed. Crude rebounded sharply in the last
30 minutes of floor trading.  “Commodities are taking a hit because the dollar is
ripping,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “The Dollar Index
crossed 83, which is hurting all these markets.”  WTI crude for June delivery slid 35 cents to settle at
$96.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices
dropped as much as 3.1 percent during the session. The volume of
all contracts traded was 55 percent above the 100-day average at
3:11 p.m. Futures rose 0.5 percent this week, the third
consecutive advance.  Brent oil for June settlement decreased 56 cents, or 0.5
percent, to end the session at $103.91 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Volume for all contracts was
21 percent above the 100-day average.  WTI gave up more than $1.50 of its loss and Brent rebounded
more than $1 at the end of the session.  “This was a day when we started with a significant move,
which lost its momentum,” said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at
Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “This afternoon was
frustrating because there was no headline to point to.”  Narrowing Spread  The European benchmark’s  premium  to WTI was $7.87 a barrel,
down from yesterday’s settlement of $8.08. The spread shrank to
$7.48 yesterday, the narrowest level on an intraday basis since
Jan. 3, 2012.  The spread may contract to as little as $5 in the third
quarter as transportation bottlenecks in the central U.S. are
cleared, according to a report by  Jeffrey Currie  and Stefan Wieler, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against
those of six major trading partners, rose as much as 0.8
percent. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities was
down 1 percent.  Currency Moves  “This is all about currency moves,” said John Kilduff, a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that
focuses on energy. “The inverse correlation between the dollar
and commodities is alive and well.”  Gold for June delivery settled at $1,436.60 an ounce on the
Comex in New York after the biggest drop since April 15, when
prices capped the biggest two-day loss in three decades. Silver
for July delivery declined 1.1 percent, to close at $23.658 an
ounce in New York.  OPEC produced 30.46 million barrels a day last month, up
from 30.18 million in March, the group’s Monthly Oil Market
Report showed. That’s the most since November, according to the
estimates based on secondary sources.  Global oil use  is forecast
to rise 800,000 barrels a day to 89.66 million barrels a day
this year, down from April’s forecast of 89.67 million barrels.  “Fundamentally, we should be below $90,” said Tariq
Zahir, a commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital Advisors in New
York. “Fundamentals are starting to take over the market now.”  U.S. Production  U.S.  crude output  rose 57,000 barrels a day to 7.37 million
last week, the highest level since February 1992, a May 8 Energy
Information Administration report showed. Stockpiles increased
230,000 barrels to 395.5 million, the most since weekly data
started in 1982. Based on monthly data, they were last at this
level in 1931.  “OPEC production is going to weigh on the market,” said
Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist and founder of
commodities trading firm Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “We have a
supply problem as there is plenty of oil. U.S. supplies are at
an 82-year high.”  Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest crude producer, welcomes
additional supplies from other producers that may help to
stabilize prices, Oil Minister  Ali Al-Naimi  said.  “New supplies are welcome,” Al-Naimi said today in a
speech in Istanbul, where he traveled to meet Turkish energy
minister  Taner Yildiz . “They will add depth and, I hope,
greater stability to world markets.”  Al-Naimi has described $100 as a “reasonable” price for
both oil consumers and producers.  Technical Resistance  The drop in prices occurred after the oil market failed to
breach key technical resistance, Yawger said.  “We touched technical resistance in the $97 to $98 area
for the third time since late January,” Yawger said. “We were
in the area in late January, early April and at the beginning of
this week and failed to break through on each occasion. Oil
touched $97.17 May 6 and has been under pressure ever since.”  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
July was 20.1 percent, little changed from 20.1 percent
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 741,240
contracts as of 3:12 p.m. It totaled 701,619 contracts
yesterday, 20 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.76 million contracts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
