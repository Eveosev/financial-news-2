The Swiss franc fell to the lowest
since late January against the euro after a measure of
unemployment in the U.S. unexpectedly fell, damping demand for
the safest assets.  “The macro data -- especially the U.S. jobs market -- have
gotten better,” said Alessandro Bee, an economist at Bank
Sarasin & Cie AG in Zurich. “It’s an environment where people
want risk -- the stock markets are doing well -- and that’s a
situation when you sell safe assets like the franc.”  Data showed yesterday that the number of Americans filing
claims for jobless benefits dropped last week to the lowest
level in more than five years, a signal employers are confident
enough in the economic outlook to hold onto workers.  That optimism has been reflected in equity markets.
European stocks gained, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index
extending its highest level since June 2008 today.  The franc depreciated to its weakest since Jan. 30 in
intra-day trading. It was down 0.4 percent at 1.2421 at 10:22
a.m. in Zurich.  The  Swiss National Bank (SNBN)  set a cap of 1.20 per euro on the
franc in September 2011 to ward off deflation and a recession.
Investors had pushed up the franc sharply against the euro as
they looked for safer place to put their money due to the
region’s debt crisis.  SNB Vice President Jean-Pierre Danthine said in a newspaper
interview last weekend that the cap on the franc remained
essential. Since the euro area’s economy was improving only
slowly, a change of course in policy in the short term was
“highly unlikely,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
