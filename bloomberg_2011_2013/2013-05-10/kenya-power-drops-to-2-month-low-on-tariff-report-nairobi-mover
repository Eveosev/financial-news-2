Kenya Power Ltd., the East African
nation’s sole electricity distributor, fell to its lowest level
in more than two months after Business Daily said the government
rejected the company’s proposed tariff increases.  The stock dropped 4.3 percent to close at 17.95 shillings
in Nairobi trading, the lowest since March 5. About 92 percent
of the three-month average volume of shares changed hands,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Deputy President William Ruto rejected proposals to
increase prices paid by consumers and asked Kenya Power to
“sort out any inefficiencies,” Nairobi-based Business Daily
reported today. If the company’s proposals had been accepted the
cost of power would have more than doubled for home users, the
Daily Nation reported in February.  “Kenya Power was banking on the tariff increase to cover
some of its costs including its capital expenses,” Faith Atiti,
an analyst at Nairobi-based NIC Securities Ltd., said in an e-mailed note to clients.  The company is still in discussions regarding the tariff
review, Managing Director Joseph Njoroge told reporters in
Nairobi today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
