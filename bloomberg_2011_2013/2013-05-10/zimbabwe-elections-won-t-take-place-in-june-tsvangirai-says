Zimbabwe won’t hold elections next
month because the ruling coalition has failed to agree on
changes to security and media laws needed to ensure for a fair
vote, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said.  “Violence has always characterized our elections,”
Tsvangirai said in an interview today with Bloomberg TV’s Ryan Chilcote during a session at the World Economic Forum in Cape
Town. “If we can contain that, it will be ready any time after
June.”  Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change has accused the
military and police of supporting President Robert Mugabe’s
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front party. The two
leaders govern in a coalition established after a disputed
election in 2008.  Elections scheduled for this year will end the four-year-old power-sharing agreement implemented by the Southern African
Development Community, which brought an end to a decade of
political and economic crises that saw inflation rise to 500
billion percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Economic growth of 5 percent is being targeted this year,
Finance Minister Tendai Biti said last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
