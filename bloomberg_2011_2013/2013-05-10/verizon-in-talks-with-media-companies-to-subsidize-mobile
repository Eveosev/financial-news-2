Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  is
holding talks with media companies that could end up paying for
some of the data users consume watching television shows on
mobile devices such as smartphones.  “We are very actively exploring those opportunities and
looking at every way to build value for our customers,” Chief
Executive Officer Daniel Mead said this week at an investor
conference sponsored by Jefferies Group.  An advertiser or content provider could contribute to the
cost of delivering videos, Mead said. That would ensure
consumers don’t run up their wireless bill by watching their
favorite content, removing an obstacle to the growth of both
mobile usage and the delivery of entertainment to devices.  “With the activity that we see in the overall industry and
certainly our industry, I don’t think it is going to be too
long” before a deal is announced, Mead said.  Mead cited a partnership between Amazon.com Inc.’s payment
transmission costs of books delivered to its Kindle reader as an
early model for such agreements. Verizon, based in  New York , is
considering more than one way to structure programs and isn’t
ready to make an announcement, Mead said.  ESPN,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s sports cable network, has had
discussions with at least one major carrier, the Wall Street
Journal  reported  yesterday, citing people familiar with the
situation. Amy Phillips, a spokeswoman for the network, said she
couldn’t comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
