The Australian dollar was 0.4 percent
from falling below parity with its U.S. counterpart for the
first time in 10 months after the central bank lowered its
inflation forecast following an interest-rate cut this week.  The so-called Aussie headed for its biggest weekly drop in
a year versus the greenback as the  Reserve Bank  of  Australia 
lowered its  benchmark  to a record 2.75 percent on May 7 and
cited unusual strength in the currency.  New Zealand ’s dollar
fell against the U.S. currency as the greenback rallied versus
most major peers and climbed past 101 yen.  “The RBA will continue cutting the cash rate into early
next year down to 2 percent, diminishing the interest-rate
support for the currency,” said  Imre Speizer , a strategist in
Auckland at  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  “If it stays below $1.01,
that augurs very poorly for the Aussie and it can fall as far as
99 U.S. cents.”  The Australian dollar declined 0.3 percent to $1.0038 at
5:25 p.m., the least since June 29. It rose 0.1 percent to
101.66 yen. New Zealand’s currency fell 0.7 percent to 83.36
U.S. cents and touched 83.29, the least since March 25. It was
little changed at 84.41 yen.  The Aussie was poised for a 2.5 percent decline this week,
the biggest since the period ended May 4, 2012. The kiwi has
dropped 2.1 percent against the greenback, the biggest five-day
slide this year.  Both the Aussie and kiwi are falling due to broad-based
buying of the  U.S. dollar , said  Sue Trinh , a senior currency
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  Hong Kong . The unwinding
of bets on gains in the currencies is adding to the pressure,
she said.  RBA Outlook  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the Australian dollar
compared with those on a drop -- so-called  net longs  -- was
30,234 on April 30. It was 29,050 for the kiwi  dollar .  The RBA lowered its inflation outlook and reiterated a
forecast for “below trend” growth this year. Consumer prices
will rise 2 percent in the year to December 2013, compared with
as much as 3 percent forecast three months earlier, the central
bank said. The RBA predicted 2013 economic growth of about 2.5
percent from a range of 2 percent to 3 percent previously.  After cutting rates on May 7, RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens 
said policy makers were using some of the scope available to
them to lower borrowing costs. Traders are betting on 28 basis
points of reductions in the next 12 months, down from 34 basis
points yesterday, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG  index 
based on swaps.  ‘Less Dovish’  “The growth estimates aren’t telling you that they
necessarily think they’re going to need to use that
ammunition,” said Ray Attrill, global co-head of currency
strategy at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. “It’s a
touch less dovish than the market was primed for. There doesn’t
seem to be a smoking gun here for a renewed sell-off in the
Aussie.”  Australia’s  government bonds fell , sending the 10-year
yield up 8 basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.23
percent, set for its highest close since April 17. The three-year rate added seven basis points to 2.64 percent.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates which is sensitive to  interest rates ,
rose to 2.85 percent from 2.83 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
