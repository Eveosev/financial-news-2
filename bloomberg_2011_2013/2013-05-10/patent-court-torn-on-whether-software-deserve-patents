The nation’s top patent court issued
a deeply divided opinion today on how to determine if software
is eligible for legal protection, reflecting the broader debate
that has split the computer industry.  The  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Federal Circuit in
Washington, which handles all patent appeals, issued a 135-page
 decision  by 10 circuit judges that included five viewpoints and
“additional reflections” from Chief Judge Randall Rader.  “We have propounded at least three incompatible standards,
devoid of consensus, serving simply to add to the unreliability
and cost of the system of patents as an incentive for
innovation,” Circuit Judge Pauline Newman wrote.  Google Inc. (GOOG) ,  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  are
among the companies that argued that patent standards for
software are too lax. A group whose members include software
makers  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  warned the appeals court
that limiting protection for software could hurt the nation’s
economy.  The case centered on patents owned by Melbourne-based Alice
Corp. over ways to minimize risk in certain computerized-trading
platforms. The court ruled CLS Bank International won’t have to
face patent-infringement claims by Alice, which is owned by
 National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  and Alice Ventures Pty.  A majority of the 10 judges said aspects of Alice’s patents
covering a method of performing the idea weren’t eligible for
protection, while the court was evenly split regarding systems
to implement that idea. Five of the judges said they would send
all or part of the case back to the trial judge for further
review.  Help Cry  The U.S. Supreme Court also has struggled to determine what
types of innovations qualify for patent protection. In 2010, the
court issued a 5-4 decision on patents for methods of conducting
business, and last year limited patents for diagnostic medical
tests. With such a fractured ruling on software, the issue
probably is headed to the high court again.  A petition “could simply attach the decision with a one
word argument -- ‘Help!’ -- and have a good chance for Supreme
Court review and guidance,” said David Long, a patent lawyer
with Dow Lohnes in  Washington .  Circuit Judge Alan Lourie, writing for five of the judges,
said courts should consider “whether steps combined with a
natural law or abstract idea are so insignificant, conventional,
or routine as to yield a claim that effectively covers the
natural law or abstract idea itself.”  Circuit Judge Kimberly Moore, writing for four judges, said
the decision by Lourie would cause “a free fall in the patent
system.”  Non-Precedent Precedent  “Let’s be clear: if all of these claims, including the
system claims, are not patent-eligible, this case is the death
of hundreds of thousands of patents, including all business
method, financial system, and software patents as well as many
computer implemented and telecommunications patents,” Moore
wrote.  Judge Richard Linn, in another opinion, said companies
concerned that there is a proliferation of software patents
should turn to Congress.  Although the court issued the full ruling as a precedential
opinion, Rader said the decisions were so split that “nothing
said today beyond our judgment has the weight of precedent.”  The case is CLS Bank v. Alice Corporation, 11-1301, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is CLS Bank International v. Alice Corp.,
07cv974, U.S. District Court for the  District of Columbia 
(Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
