Gold capped the biggest drop in more
than three weeks in New York as a stronger dollar curbed demand
for the metal as an alternative investment.  The dollar reached a five-week high versus six major
currencies today after data showed yesterday claims for U.S.
jobless benefits unexpectedly dropped to the lowest in more than
five years. Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President
 Charles Plosser , who doesn’t vote on policy this year, told
reporters yesterday that he favors reducing the central bank’s
$85 billion in monthly bond purchases that were designed to
stimulate the  U.S. economy .  “The dollar is higher,” driving prices lower, Bart Melek,
the head of commodity strategy at TD Securities in Toronto, said
in a telephone interview. “You had a Fed official talking about
easing stimulus, and that drove currencies and precipitated the
move lower in metals.”  Gold futures fell 2.2 percent to settle at $1,436.60 an
ounce at 1:42 p.m. on the Comex in New York. That’s the biggest
drop since April 15, when prices capped the biggest two-day loss
in three decades. Assets in  exchange-traded products  gained 2.5
metric tons to 2,241.7 tons yesterday, the first increase since
April 1, according to data tracked by Bloomberg. Global ETP
assets have still declined 15 percent this year. Rising coin
sales and demand for physical gold in  Asia  drove futures up 8.7
percent since reaching a two-year low of $1,321.50 on April 16.  Physical Demand  “Gold’s been put a little bit under pressure because of
the dollar move,”  Afshin Nabavi , a senior vice president at
bullion refiner MKS ( Switzerland ) SA in Geneva, said today by
telephone. “Physical-related demand had been very strong up to
yesterday. The lower gold goes, the more physical demand will
come in.”  Silver futures for July delivery fell 1.1 percent to
$23.658 an ounce on the Comex, capping a weekly decline of 1.5
percent.  Palladium futures for June delivery slid 1.3 percent to
$705.70 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Platinum
futures for July delivery declined 2 percent to $1,486 an ounce.
Prices are down 1 percent this week.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the top producer of the
metal, may cut as many as 6,000 jobs at its South African mines,
reducing an earlier plan that may have resulted in 14,000
losses. The new proposals will see three shafts in the
Rustenburg region being idled rather than four, with production
capacity to be cut by as much as 350,000 ounces, less than the
400,000 ounces first announced, the company said today in a
statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
