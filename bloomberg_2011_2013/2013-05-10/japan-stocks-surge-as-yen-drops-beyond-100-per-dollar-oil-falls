The  Dollar Index (DXY)  extended its biggest
two-day rally since July, helping trigger a plunge in
commodities, and Treasuries tumbled amid improving confidence in
the strength of the American economy. U.S. stocks advanced,
returning benchmark indexes to all-time highs.  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against six major
peers, added 0.4 percent to 83.15 to extend its two-day gain to
1.5 percent. The yen traded beyond 101 per dollar for the first
time in four years. Gold lost more than 2 percent and wheat and
corn fell after a crops report. Ten-year Treasury yields rose
eight basis points to 1.89 percent, the highest since March. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent to 1,633.7,
extending a weekly gain to 1.2 percent and reaching a record for
the sixth time in seven days.  Gold and wheat helped lead losses in 20 of the 24
commodities tracked by the S&P GSCI Index, sending the gauge
down as much as 2.2 percent, as the stronger dollar caused
declines in prices of materials denominated in the U.S.
currency. U.S. jobless claims yesterday fell to a five-year low,
bolstering optimism in the economy. Group of Seven finance
chiefs and central bankers meet today in the U.K. for talks.  “Commodities are taking a hit because the dollar is
ripping,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at
Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York. “The Dollar Index
crossed 83, which is hurting all these markets.”  Dollar, Commodities  The  U.S. dollar  strengthened against all 16 major peers,
climbing more than 1 percent versus the currencies of  New
Zealand  and  South Korea .  Gold for June delivery tumbled 2.2 percent to $1,436.60 an
ounce. West Texas Intermediate oil dropped 0.4 percent to $96.04
a barrel, paring a loss of as much as 3.1 percent.  Wheat fell 2.4 percent and corn declined 2.1 percent. Corn
inventories in the U.S., the world’s largest grower and
exporter, may more than double as farms recover from the drought
in 2012 to produce the biggest crop ever. The harvest this year
will surge 31 percent from 2012 to 14.14 billion bushels (359.2
million metric tons), the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
today in a report.  The  S&P 500  retreated 0.4 percent yesterday after reaching
a record for five straight days. The index is up 15 percent this
year and has surged more than 141 percent since its bear-market
low in 2009 amid earnings growth and monetary stimulus from the
 Federal Reserve .  Stock Movers  Gap Inc. added 5.6 percent after forecasting first-quarter
profit that topped estimates. Nvidia Corp. rose 4.5 percent as
fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings exceeded projections.
Molycorp Inc. jumped 31 percent after posting a narrower-than-estimated loss. Hess Corp. sank 2.3 percent after saying it will
strip its chief executive officer of the chairmanship. Energy
and commodity stocks posted the only declines out of 10 S&P 500
groups, while health-care and consumer shares led gains. S&P 500
financial shares gained 0.5 percent as a group.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said risks persist
in wholesale funding markets used frequently by Wall Street
brokers to finance securities trading.  “Important risks remain in the short-term wholesale
funding markets,” Bernanke said today in a speech at a Chicago
Fed banking conference. “One of the key risks is how the system
would respond to the failure of a broker-dealer or other major
borrower.”  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed for a fourth day as
ArcelorMittal and  BT Group Plc (BT/A)  reported earnings that topped
estimates. The world’s biggest steelmaker rallied 4.2 percent,
the most since January, and the U.K. phone company jumped 12
percent, the biggest gain in almost four years.  The European gauge advanced 1.3 percent this week, a third
straight week of gains.  Emerging Markets  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index fell 1 percent today, the
most in three weeks, as the weaker yen threatens developing-nation exporters. The yen has tumbled 23 percent since September
and is headed for its biggest annual loss since 1979 as Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe and the  Bank of Japan  boost the supply of
the currency to beat deflation.  South Korea’s Kospi index dropped 1.8 percent, the most
since July 23 on a closing basis, as Samsung Electronics Co.,
South Korea’s biggest exporter of consumer electronics, slid 2.6
percent.  The won depreciated 1.3 percent versus the dollar, the most
in three months, on speculation South Korean authorities will
favor depreciation to support exporters as the yen’s decline
makes Japanese rivals more competitive.  Thailand ’s baht weakened 1 percent against the dollar.
Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong said today the Bank of
Thailand should reduce its benchmark rate by more than a quarter
of a percentage point or implement  capital controls  to stem baht
appreciation.  Yen Slides  The yen breached 100 per dollar yesterday for the first
time since April 2009 and analysts predict a year-end exchange
rate of 105, according to the median of more than 50 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan ’s currency slid 0.5 percent to 131.90 per euro and
touched 132.26, its weakest level since January 2010. The
Australian dollar fell below parity for the first time since
June, dropping to as low as 99.61 U.S. cents.  The Swiss franc fell to the lowest since January against
the euro amid reduced demand for haven assets, while  Norway ’s
krone strengthened against all but one of its 16 major peers
after a report showed inflation accelerated in April.  Japan’s 10-year yield climbed 10 basis points to 0.70
percent. The yield on similar-maturity German bunds increased 10
basis points to 1.37 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
