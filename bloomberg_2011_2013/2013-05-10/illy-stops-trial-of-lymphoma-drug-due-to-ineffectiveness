Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  halted development of
an experimental cancer drug after the medicine failed to
lengthen survival for certain lymphoma patients in a study.  The decision will result in a charge of $30 million in the
second quarter, Indianapolis-based Lilly said in a statement
today. The drug, enzastaurin, was in the most-advanced stage of
testing and had been expected to generate $260 million in annual
sales by 2018, according to  Mark Schoenebaum , an analyst with
ISI Group.  Lilly said in April it was expecting to seek U.S.
regulatory approval this year for the drug to prevent the
relapse of diffuse large b-cell lymphoma, a type of blood
cancer. The setback leaves Lilly with four treatments it may be
able to bring to market next year. The company needs new drugs
to help offset the loss of patent protection later this year on
its top-selling product, Cymbalta for depression.  “We are disappointed in the results that we’re announcing
today,” said Richard Gaynor, vice president of product
development and medical affairs for Lilly’s cancer unit, in the
statement. “However, our oncology pipeline is still one of the
most robust across the industry.”  Lilly rose less than 1 percent to $54.82 at the close in
 New York . It has gained 31 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
