German stocks  advanced, as the
benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index extended its record high and headed for its
third weekly gain, after a report showed exports from the
country increased in March.  Munich Re  rose 1.5 percent, pacing gains among European
insurance companies.  Salzgitter AG (SZG)  jumped 6.9 percent after
Credit Suisse Group AG advised investors to buy the shares.  The DAX gained 1.1 percent to 8,351.5 at 9:49 a.m. in
Frankfurt, climbing for a fourth day. The equity benchmark has
risen 2.9 percent this week as companies reported better-than-forecast results and German factory orders unexpectedly
increased. The benchmark has rallied 9.7 percent so far this
year. The broader HDAX Index added 1 percent today.  “The rally is liquidity driven,” Raimund Saxinger, a  fund
manager  at Frankfurt-Trust Investment GmbH, which oversees about
$22 billion, said in a telephone interview. “Especially,
cyclicals are in demand. This seems to suggest that there is
increasing optimism of a recovery in the second half of this
year.”  German exports , adjusted for working days and seasonal
changes, advanced 0.5 percent in March from February, when they
dropped 1.2 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said. The increase matched the median forecast of 16 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. Imports rose 0.8 percent.  South Korea’s cut its main interest rate yesterday. That
was the 511th reduction worldwide since June 2007, according to
Bank of America Corp.’s tally, done before  Vietnam  and Sri Lanka
today said they’re lowering their policy rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
