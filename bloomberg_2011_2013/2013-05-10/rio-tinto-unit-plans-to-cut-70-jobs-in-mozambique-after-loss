A subsidiary of Rio Tinto Group said
it will cut at least 70 jobs in  Mozambique  this year after
booking an operational loss in the nation last year.  The planned redundancies include 50 local posts and 20
expatriate roles covering mining support to operations such as
exploration and research, Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  “Due to low prices of commodities in the global market and
the constraints created by the infrastructure and transport
logistics of coal, Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM) incurred
losses in its operations in 2012,” the statement showed. “The
company is taking the necessary steps to ensure that the
business become profitable by the end of 2013.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
