Spot gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
surged to the highest level against futures in more than 11
months after  Tesoro Corp. (TSO) ’s Anacortes refinery in Washington
state was said to repair a fluid catalytic cracker.  Tesoro’s 125,000-barrel-a-day Anacortes plant shut the
cracking unit, which turns fuel from the crude unit into lighter
products such as gasoline, on May 6 after discovering a catalyst
leak, a person with direct knowledge of operations there said
May 7. The refinery is running normally after finishing
unscheduled maintenance on a unit, Tina Barbee, a spokeswoman at
the company’s headquarters in  San Antonio , said by e-mail today.  Conventional gasoline in Portland advanced 12 cents to a
premium of 67 cents a gallon against futures traded on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange  at 4:11 p.m., data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That’s the highest level since May 30, 2012.  The Anacortes refinery ships gasoline,  jet fuel  and diesel
by pipeline to western Washington and Oregon and delivers
products including California-blend gasoline by ship and barge,
according to Tesoro’s website.  California-blend gasoline in  San Francisco  gained 5 cents
against futures to a premium of 32.5 cents a gallon. The same
fuel in  Los Angeles  dropped 4 cents to 31.5 cents above futures.  Low-sulfur diesel in Portland jumped 9 cents versus ultra-low-sulfur diesel futures on the Nymex to a premium of 17.5
cents a gallon, its highest level since March 27.  California-blend diesel in San Francisco slipped 0.5 cent
versus ULSD futures to a premium of 4.5 cents a gallon. The fuel
in Los Angeles was unchanged at a discount of 2.25 cents.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and CARB diesel in Los Angeles climbed for the
first time in three days, gaining 11 cents to $24.52 a barrel at
4:13 p.m.  New York  time. The spread, a rough measure of refining
margins, has more than doubled since the beginning of this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
