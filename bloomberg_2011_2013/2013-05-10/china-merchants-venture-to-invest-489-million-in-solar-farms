China Merchants New Energy Group , a
Hong Kong-based renewable-energy project developer, will form a
joint venture with Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps
Investment Co. to invest 3 billion  yuan  ($489 million) to
develop solar farms.  The venture will build about 300 megawatts of solar power
plants in  China â€™s western region of Xinjiang by 2015, China
Merchants said in a  statement  posted on its website yesterday.  The plan comes after China Merchants in August agreed to
partner with  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd (3800) , the biggest maker of
polysilicon, to develop about 973 megawatts of solar power
projects in China.  China Merchants last year secured as much as 10 billion
yuan of financing from China Development Bank Corp. to develop
solar farms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
