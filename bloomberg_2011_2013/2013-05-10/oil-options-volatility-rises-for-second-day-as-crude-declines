Crude options volatility rose for a
second day as the underlying futures declined on a higher dollar
that reduced the appeal of raw materials priced in the U.S.
currency.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
July, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 20.12 percent at 3:40 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up from 20.08 percent yesterday.  West Texas Intermediate crude for June delivery dropped 35
cents to settle at $96.04 a barrel a barrel on the Nymex. July-delivery futures slid 37 cents to $96.29. The  Dollar Index (DXY) 
advanced above 83 for the first time in more than two weeks.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
June $90 puts, which rose 1 cent to 7 cents a barrel on volume
of 8,769 contracts at 3:47 p.m. in  New York . June $93 puts were
the second-most active, advancing 3 cents to 23 cents a barrel
on 4,090 lots.  Puts accounted for 58 percent of electronic trading volume
today. Bearish bets made up 53 percent of yesterdayâ€™s volume of
122,473 contracts.  July $90 puts were the most-active options traded in the
previous session, with 14,730 contracts changing hands. They
rose 10 cents to 75 cents a barrel. June $90 puts were unchanged
at 6 cents a barrel on 4,707 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $80 puts with 37,662
contracts. Next were December $105 calls with 37,288 and
December $110 calls puts with 33,844.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
