Global farmers will harvest the
biggest grain and soybean crops ever this year, boosting food
reserves to the highest since 2000, the U.S. government said.
Corn, wheat and oilseed futures in  Chicago  slumped.  Combined production of the three crops will jump 9.6
percent to 1.952 billion metric tons, the biggest increase since
2004, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report .
While lower prices will increase consumption, world  stockpiles 
will jump 13 percent to 416 million tons, the highest since
2001, the agency said.  After the most-severe U.S. drought since the 1930s drove
corn and soybean prices to record highs last year, grain and
oilseed futures have plunged more than 20 percent, curbing food
costs. Average U.S. cash-corn prices will fall 32 percent in the
year that starts Sept. 1, while soy-based  animal feed  may drop
29 percent, boosting meat and milk production, the USDA said.  “We will have an extremely big global supply of grains and
oilseeds this year, provided there are no serious weather
problems this summer,” said  Dale Durchholz , the senior market
analyst at AgriVisor LLC in Bloomington,  Illinois . “There is
absolutely no reason for consumers to chase grain and soybeans
at these high prices ahead of record harvests.”  Corn futures for July delivery slumped 1.9 percent to close
at $6.3625 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
This week, the price dropped 3.8 percent, the most in a month.
The grain has declined 8.9 percent this year.  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 2.7 percent to $7.0425
a bushel. The price has dropped 9.5 percent this year. Soybean
futures for July delivery dropped 0.7 percent to $13.99 a
bushel. The price has tumbled 22 percent from a record in
September.  U.S. Corn  The U.S. corn harvest will surge 31 percent to 14.14
billion bushels (359.2 million metric tons), the USDA said.
Reserves on Aug. 31, 2014, will more than double to 2.004
billion bushels from a year earlier. Analysts in a Bloomberg
survey expected 2.038 billion.  The U.S. soybean crop is projected at a record 3.39 billion
bushels, up from 3.015 billion harvested a year earlier.
Inventories on Aug. 31, 2014, will rise 265 million bushels from
this year’s projection of 125 million, the smallest since 2004,
the agency said.  Global  rice  production will rise 1.9 percent to a record
479.3 million tons, the fourth straight annual gain, the USDA
said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, followed by soybeans, hay
and wheat, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
