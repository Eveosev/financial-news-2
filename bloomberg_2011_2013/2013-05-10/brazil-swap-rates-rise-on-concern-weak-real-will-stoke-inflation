Brazil ’s swap rates climbed on
speculation a weakening real will stoke inflation and prompt the
central bank to increase borrowing costs at a faster pace.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 rose five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 8.29 percent at 10:04
a.m. in Sao Paulo, the highest level since April 25 on a closing
basis. They are up two basis points this week. The real
depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.0175 per dollar, extending its
decline over the past 12 months to 3.2 percent. The currency has
fallen 0.4 percent since May 3.  “There is a problem with the real’s depreciation causing
risks of accelerating inflation,” Alfredo Barbutti, an
economist at BGC Liquidez in  Sao Paulo , said in a phone
interview. “There are risks even though the government says the
price increases are under control.”  The national statistics agency reported May 8 that consumer
prices rose 6.49 percent in April from a year earlier,
surpassing the 6.42 percent median forecast of 30 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. The central bank has a target range of
2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
