Eurocash SA , Poland’s biggest
distributor of non-durable consumer goods, slumped the most in
more than eight months after reporting earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates.  The  stock  fell as much as 9.4 percent and traded 7.7
percent lower at 53.1 zloty as of 2:56 p.m. in Warsaw, the
steepest drop since Aug. 29. Turnover amounted to 463 percent of
the three-month daily average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Eurocash has been the best-performing stock in the benchmark
WIG20 Index this year, climbing 22 percent and valuing it at 7.4
billion zloty ($2.3 billion).  “The results were below expectations on lower
profitability” and cash flow generation was “weak,”  Gabriela Borowska , an analyst at Wood & Co. in Warsaw, said in a note.
“If the trends seen in the first quarter continue into the
second and beyond, Eurocash’s ability to deliver strong growth
and meaningful profitability improvements is overly dependent on
executing larger-scale merger and acquisition transactions.”  First-quarter net income was 11.3 million zloty, coming
below the mean 13.9 million-zloty estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of nine analysts. Earnings before interest and taxes stood at
21.2 million zloty, compared with analyst estimates at 33.3
million zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
