Eleven lots of 1982 Bordeaux wines,
including eight cases of  Chateau Latour  and three double magnums
of  Chateau Petrus , are estimated to fetch as much as 12,000
pounds ($18,600) each at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  sale in  London  this month.  A single bottle of Romanee-Conti 2005 Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti Burgundy carries a price tag of as much as 8,000
pounds, while a similar one from 2009 is estimated at as much as
7,500 pounds, according to the Sotheby’s online catalog.  Demand from investors for Bordeaux after two price slumps
in the past five years has boosted the London-based Liv-ex Fine
Wine 50 Index by 9 percent since November, when it touched a 31-month low. The daily gauge, which fell in April after four
straight monthly gains, rose again at the start of this month
while the Liv-ex Fine Wine 100 Index, calculated monthly, has
gained 5.9% so far this year.  The wine market “is reasonably stable at the moment,”
said  Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund
in London. Smith said his start-of-year forecast for a 14
percent gain in 2013 “still looks about right.”. The fund,
invested in Bordeaux, has about $50 million under management.  Other leading Bordeaux lots in the sale, scheduled for May
22, include two cases of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 2001
Pauillac, estimated to fetch as much as 5,500 pounds each, six
cases of Chateau Cheval Blanc 1982 from Saint-Emilion, with a
price tag of as much as 5,200 pounds each, and eight cases of
Latour 1996 estimated at as much as 4,400 pounds each.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
