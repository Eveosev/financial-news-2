Bank Pekao SA, Poland’s second-largest lender and a unit of  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , posted the lowest
quarterly profit in almost three years after cuts in the
country’s interest rates reduced income from loans.  Net income declined to 665.5 million zloty ($210 million)
in the first quarter from 710.6 million zloty a year earlier,
the bank said in a regulatory statement today. That beat the
mean 648.2 million-zloty  estimate  of 13  analysts  surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Slowing economy in the European Union’s largest eastern
member and the Polish central bank’s cut in borrowing costs to a
record low hurt banks’ earnings. The industry’s combined profit
fell 5 percent in the first quarter, according to data on the
Warsaw-based financial regulator’s website. The National Bank of
Poland lowered interest rates by a total of 150 basis points
between November and March as the country’s inflation rate fell
to an almost seven-year low in March.  Pekao’s net interest income fell 5 percent to 1.13 billion
zloty in the quarter, while net fees and commission rose to 552
million zloty from 550.5 million zloty. Bad loan provisions
surged 22 percent to 165 million zloty, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
