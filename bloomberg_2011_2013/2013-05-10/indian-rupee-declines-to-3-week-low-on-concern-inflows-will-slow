India’s rupee fell to the lowest
level in more than three weeks on speculation an improving U.S.
economy will prompt the  Federal Reserve  to rein in stimulus
measures that have spurred fund flows into  emerging markets .
Bonds dropped before a local debt sale.  Claims for jobless benefits in the world’s largest economy
unexpectedly dropped to the lowest level in more than five
years, an official report showed yesterday. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the greenback against six counterparts, rose the
most since April 17 yesterday as the yen dropped past 100 per
dollar for the first time in more than four years. The rupee’s
losses will be limited as data due today will probably show a
rebound in factory output, according to Credit Agricole CIB.  “Currencies should come under clear downward pressure due
to the strength of the dollar in global markets,” analysts at
 Credit Agricole , including Hong Kong-based Dariusz Kowalczyk,
wrote in a report today. “Indian industrial output is likely to
rebound more than anticipated, providing support for the
rupee.”  The rupee declined 0.5 percent to 54.5375 per dollar as of
9:39 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 54.605 earlier, the weakest since April 16. The currency
has dropped 1.1 percent this week. One-month implied volatility,
a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, rose 36 basis points, or 0.36 percentage point, today
to 8.27 percent.  Global investors have poured $17.6 billion into Indian
stocks and bonds this year, exchange data show.  Bank of Japan 
Governor  Haruhiko Kuroda  pledged in April to double monthly bond
purchases and scoop up longer-term debt to reach a 2 percent
annual inflation goal, debasing the yen.  Factory Output  India’s  industrial production  rose 2.4 percent in March
from a year earlier, after a 0.6 percent gain the previous
month, according to the median of 26 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey before data due around 11 a.m. in  New Delhi .  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 rose one
basis point to 7.62 percent in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate was 7.61 yesterday, the lowest
on a benchmark 10-year note since July 2010.  The  finance ministry  will auction 150 billion rupees ($2.8
billion) of bonds maturing in 2020, 2022, 2032 and 2042 today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.40 per
dollar, compared with 55.22 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.20 versus 54.90. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
