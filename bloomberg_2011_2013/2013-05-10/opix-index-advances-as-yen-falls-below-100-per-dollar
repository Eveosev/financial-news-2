Japan ’s  Topix Index (TPX)  climbed to the
highest close in 4 1/2 years as the yen weakened past 100
against the dollar and earnings at companies including  Nikon
Corp. (7731)  cheered investors.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , the Japanese automaker most dependent on
exports, soared 7.2 percent as the currency slid against most of
its peers. Nikon climbed the most in four years after the camera
maker’s profit forecast beat analyst estimates.  Sharp Corp. (6753) 
surged 6.4 percent after the Asahi newspaper said the money-losing electronics maker will cut 5,000 more jobs.  The Topix added 2.4 percent to close at 1,210.60 in Tokyo,
the highest since September 2008. About three stocks gained for
each that fell on the measure. The exporter-heavy  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  gained 2.9 percent to 14,607.54 today, advancing
6.7 percent for the week, the most since December 2009.  “The yen weakened beyond a psychological threshold and may
fall further, giving the stock market a direct boost,” saidTakahiro Nakano, a Tokyo-based strategist at Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest bank by market
value. “Exporters are showing strong results, supporting the
market. Also, companies may raise profit forecasts because many
of them have conservative estimates.”  The Topix this week recouped losses from the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. amid signs the U.S. economy is
picking up, while Japan’s new leadership takes steps to end
deflation. The gauge has surged more than 40 percent this year,
the most among major indexes.  Fed Stimulus  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent
today. The measure dropped 0.4 percent yesterday after extending
its record level for five days as Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said he favors scaling
back the pace of stimulus.  The yen slumped below 101 per dollar today, touching the
lowest level since April 2009. Japan’s current-account surplus
rose in March to the highest level in a year as a depreciating
yen boosted repatriated earnings. The excess in the widest
measure of trade was 1.25 trillion yen ($12.4 billion), the
Ministry of Finance said today.  Exporters rallied, with Mazda jumping 7.2 percent to 356
yen.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  gained 5 percent to 6,050 yen. Fuji
Heavy Industries Ltd., the maker of Subaru cars that gets 65
percent of its sales abroad, surged 11 percent to 2,157 yen.  Japanese stocks also rose after positive earnings reports.
Nikon soared 15 percent to 2,500 yen, the biggest rally since
January 2009, after forecasting profit will rise 53 percent to
65 billion yen this fiscal year. The camera maker’s rating was
raised to overweight at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc.
The stock headed for the biggest gain since January 2009.  Apartment Sales  Mitsui Fudosan Co. soared 7.3 percent to 3,450 yen after
the developer, Japan’s biggest, projected full-year profit to
rise 9.3 percent to 65 billion yen in the 12 months through
March 2014 on plans to sell more apartments.  Of the 521 companies on the Topix that have reported full-year earnings since April 1, and for which Bloomberg has
estimates, 310 beat analysts’ projections.  Sharp jumped 6.4 percent to 450 yen, the highest in a year,
after Asahi reported the TV maker plans to cut its workforce by
about 10 percent as part of an effort to restructure its
unprofitable display business ahead of debt deadlines. The
shares surged 15 percent yesterday on a report Samsung
Electronics Co. may invest more in the company.  Sony Trails  Sony Corp. (6758)  rose even after its profit forecast missed
expectations amid a fight to regain market share from Samsung.
Japan’s biggest TV maker projected that full-year net income
will rise to 50 billion yen, less than analysts’ average
estimate of 66.4 billion yen. Shares of the company, which
returned to profit after four years of losses, added 2.5 percent
to 1,787 yen.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index gained 1.8
percent to 26.08, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.5
