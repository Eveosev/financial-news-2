Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. , which
is gathering money to pay creditors, said it may try to sell
some of the $14 billion in unsecured claims the defunct firm has
against brokerage affiliate Lehman Brothers Inc.  The rights to money from the brokerage arose from a
 settlement  that won court approval last month, Lehman said in a
statement today. In addition to the unsecured claims, the accord
provided the parent company with $2.3 billion in customer claims
on the brokerage, Lehman has said.  Lehman “intends to explore monetization opportunities”
related to the general unsecured claims, according to the
statement. Lazard Ltd. was hired to advise on the potential
deals, Lehman said.  Lehman, which is still liquidating after exiting bankruptcy
court protection last year, made a third payment to creditors on
April 4. It said in October that its largest claim on an
affiliate was $15.2 billion owed by the brokerage.  Under an agreement disclosed in February, and following the
outlines of a deal struck in October, the brokerage allowed the
parent to claim about $16.3 billion and granted affiliate Lehman
Brothers International Europe a $7.5 billion customer claim and
a $4 billion general estate claim.  Lehman failed in September 2008, filing the biggest
bankruptcy in U.S. history, because of too much debt and risky
real estate investments, according to an examiner’s report.  The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
