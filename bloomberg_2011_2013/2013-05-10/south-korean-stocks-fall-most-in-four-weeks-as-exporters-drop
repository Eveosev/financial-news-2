South Korean  stocks  fell the most in
four weeks, led by exporters, after the won climbed to its
highest level against the yen in more than four years.  The  Kospi index  lost 1.3 percent, the most since April 12,
to 1,954.58 as of 11:41 a.m. in  Seoul . Samsung Electronics Co.,
the world’s biggest maker of mobile phones, sank 2.1 percent,
while Kia Motors Corp. dropped 3.9 percent.  Lotte Shopping Co. (023530) 
slumped the most since October 2011 on lower-than-estimated
operating profit.  The Kospi has declined 2.1 percent this year, compared with
a 0.1 percent loss by the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index, as a 13
percent gain in the won against the yen hurt the competitiveness
of South Korean exporters against Japanese rivals. Kia, South
 Korea ’s second-largest automaker, reported on April 26 a 35
percent drop in first-quarter profit as the won’s strength
dragged on sales.  “The weaker yen is chilling sentiment toward Korean
companies that are competing with Japanese names in key global
markets,” Im Jeong Jae, a Seoul-based  fund manager  at Shinhan
BNP Paribas Asset Management Co., which oversees about $28
billion, said by phone today. “It will inevitably be left as a
burden for the Korean market if the yen continues to weaken.”  The won gained 1.3 percent to 10.91 versus the yen today,
poised for the highest close since September 2008, and dropped
0.7 percent against the dollar. South Korea’s currency has risen
against the yen this year amid pledges of unprecedented monetary
stimulus by the government of Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  Domestic institutions sold a net 73.24 billion won ($66
million) of stocks today, while foreign investors sold 69.1
billion won, according to Korea Exchange data.  The Kospi climbed 1.2 percent yesterday to a five-week high
after the  Bank of Korea  lowered the benchmark  seven-day
repurchase rate  to 2.5 percent from 2.75 percent, a move that
was predicted by six of 20 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News . The South Korean gauge trades at 9  times  12-month
projected profit, compared with the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index’s 10.5 times, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
