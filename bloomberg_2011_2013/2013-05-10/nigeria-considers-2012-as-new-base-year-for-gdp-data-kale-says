Nigeria’s statistics bureau is
considering using 2012 as a base for the country’s gross
domestic product data as it reviews its methods, said the head
of the agency, Yemi Kale.  The  National Bureau of Statistics  is updating its GDP base
year to give a better indication of the size and composition of
the economy of Africa’s largest oil producer. It had previously
decided to use 2010 as the reference.  The Abuja-based statistics office will decide before the
end of the month which of the two years is better, Kale said in
a phone interview yesterday from Abuja.  The agency agreed to look into the issue after consulting
experts from inside and outside government. They advised the use
of 2012 as the base year because they thought 2010 “isn’t a
normal year,” Kale said. “We were quite comfortable with 2010,
but they highlighted some problems.”  The West African country’s GDP is currently based on
production and consumption patterns in 1990. The updated data
will probably boost the reported size of the Nigerian economy,
according to the statistics bureau.  The re-based data will probably be released sometime next
year, Kale said.  Nigeria’s economy, the second-largest in sub-Saharan
 Africa , was estimated at $268.7 billion last year and forecast
to expand 7.2 percent this year by the International Monetary
Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
