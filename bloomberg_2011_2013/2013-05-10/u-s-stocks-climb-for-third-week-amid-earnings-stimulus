U.S. stocks  climbed for a third week,
pushing benchmark indexes to record levels, as companies from
Walt Disney Co. to DirecTV beat earnings estimates and central
banks worldwide stepped up monetary stimulus to boost growth.  Disney and DirecTV rallied at least 3.7 percent, pacing
gains among consumer stocks. Whole Foods Market Inc. and
 Electronic Arts (EA)  Inc. jumped more than 10 percent on better-than-expected profit forecasts. Bank of America Corp. advanced 6.4
percent after settling a five-year legal battle with  MBIA Inc. (MBI) 
over soured mortgage debt. McDonald’s Corp. slipped 2.6 percent
as sales dropped in April amid slowing demand in  Asia .  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 1.2 percent to
1,633.70 over the five days, extending its 2013 gain to 15
percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced 144.53
points, or 1 percent, to 15,118.49. Both indexes reached record
highs on the final day of the week, after the Dow closed above
15,000 for the first time on May 7.  “Yes, we are at record highs, but if you take into
consideration where earnings are, we are pretty fairly valued,”
 Greg Peterson , director of investment research at Ballentine
Partners LLC in Waltham,  Massachusetts , which manages about $4
billion in assets, said by phone. “ Interest rates  are
incredibly low around the world. If anything that would give us
a pause, how will that unwind?”  Global equities advanced for the week as central banks from
 Australia  and  South Korea  lowered their benchmark interest
rates, joining a wave of monetary easing spanning from the U.S.
to  Europe . The S&P 500 posted its only loss of the week on May 9
after Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President  Charles
Plosser  said he favors scaling back the central bank’s pace of
stimulus.  Stimulus Policy  The Fed is currently buying $85 billion of debt each month
and central bank officials have been debating whether to expand
or curb the program. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has pledged to
hold the target interest rate near zero as long as unemployment
remains above 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation doesn’t
exceed 2.5 percent.  Three rounds of monetary stimulus from the Fed and better-than-expected corporate earnings have propelled the  bull market 
in U.S. equities to a fifth year and driven the S&P 500 up 141
percent from a 12-year low in 2009.  Equities also gained during the week as earnings topped
forecasts. About 72 percent of the 452 S&P 500 companies that
have released results since the start of the  earnings season 
have exceeded profit projections, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Analysts forecast earnings will grow 6.8 percent this year
to a record $108.80 a share.  Expensive Levels  The  S&P 500  is valued at 16 times reported profits,
approaching the most expensive levels in almost three years,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The multiple was 17.5
at the previous market peak in October 2007.  “We still see reasonable equity valuations,” Brian Peery,
who helps oversee about $3.5 billion for Novato, California-based Hennessy Funds, said by phone. “There is probably a
pretty good amount being left in the market. People are waiting
for a potential dip to increase their equity exposure.”  Eight out of 10 S&P 500  groups  gained for the week as
industrial, consumer-discretionary and financial shares climbed
the most, rising at least 1.9 percent. The Chicago Board Options
Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, fell 2 percent to 12.59,
extending the equity volatility gauge’s loss for the year to 30
percent.  Theme Parks  Disney climbed 3.7 percent to an all-time high of $67.20.
The world’s largest entertainment company said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 32 percent as guests splurged at theme parks
in California and  Florida .  DirecTV (DTV)  surged 10 percent to a record $63.80. The largest
U.S. satellite-television provider reported profit that topped
estimates, bolstered by Latin American subscriber growth.  Whole Foods jumped 10 percent to $100.89. The largest
natural-goods grocer in the U.S. boosted its forecast for
earnings this year after sales at established locations
increased and second-quarter profit climbed 20 percent. Whole
Foods, which plans to triple its U.S. store count to about
1,000, has lured Americans who are becoming more concerned with
eating organic and healthy foods.  ‘Star Wars’  Electronic Arts rallied 25 percent, the most in the S&P
500, to $22.48. The No. 2 U.S. video-game maker forecast annual
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates as the company is
cutting jobs and reducing expenses to cushion against a
potentially rocky transition to new consoles. Electronic Arts
also reached a multiyear agreement with Disney to create games
based on “ Star Wars ” characters after Disney said it would
stop making them itself.  Bank of America gained 6.4 percent to $13.02 while MBIA
soared 57 percent to $15.42. The companies agreed to a deal in
which the lender will pay MBIA the equivalent of $1.7 billion
and give Bank of America a 5 percent stake in the bond insurer.
S&P raised MBIA’s  debt rating  to investment grade for the first
time in four years following the agreement.  McDonald’s (MCD)  declined 2.6 percent to $100.20 for the worst
retreat in the Dow. The world’s biggest restaurant chain said
sales at stores open at least 13 months fell 0.6 percent in
April as growth slowed in its Asia-Pacific region. Analysts
estimated a 0.5 percent drop, the average of estimates from
Consensus Metrix.  Restaurant chains have been facing increasing consumer
scrutiny in  China  following an outbreak of bird flu and also
after a former poultry supplier to Yum! Brands Inc. was
investigated for selling chicken with excessive levels of
antibiotics.  Utility shares fell the most among 10 groups in the S&P
500, erasing 2.7 percent. AES Corp. dropped 3.7 percent to
$13.31 after reporting first-quarter earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates. AES sees earnings little changed or
declining through 2015 in Europe, the Middle East and Africa,
where it has about 8,200 megawatts of generation, according to
an investor presentation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
