Thailand ’s baht fell by the most in a
week on speculation of interest-rate cuts after Finance Minister
Kittiratt Na-Ranong said he will meet the central bank’s
monetary policy committee on May 13.  Kittiratt has repeatedly asked for lower borrowing costs to
stem fund inflows that sent the baht to a 16-year high in April.
He said yesterday the central bank should focus on the exchange
rate and not just on inflation. South Korea, Australia and  India 
eased policy this month while the Bank of Thailand has kept
rates steady. Most Asian currencies fell versus the dollar today
as the yen breached the 100-level for the first time since 2009.  “Concerns about measures to stem currency gains, whether
it’s intervention, a rate cut or capital controls, are keeping
some depreciation pressure on the baht,” said  Yuji Kameoka ,
chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Co. in  Tokyo .
“With the yen’s weakness, there’s general downward pressure on
regional currencies.”  The baht slumped 0.8 percent, the most since May 3, to
29.63 per dollar as of 8:43 a.m. in Bangkok, trimming the week’s
gain to 0.2 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
is still up 3.2 percent this year, the best performance in Asia.
It reached 28.56 on April 22 and April 19, the strongest level
since July 1997.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, dropped eight basis
points today and 12 basis points this week to 6.26 percent.  Interest Rates  Thailand’s  benchmark interest rate  of 2.75 percent compares
with a maximum of 0.25 percent in the U.S. and 0.1 percent in
 Japan . It is still lower than neighboring  Indonesia ’s 5.75
percent, the  Philippines ’ 3.5 percent and  Malaysia ’s 3 percent.  The May 13 meeting will be attended by other government
agencies as well, Finance Minister Kittiratt said yesterday.  Central bank Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said yesterday
that the rate differential is a factor influencing capital
inflows. He signaled he may be inclined to cut rates if economic
growth starts to cool.  The yield on the 3.625 percent government bonds due June
2023 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.35
percent this week, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The rate
declined one basis point today to the lowest level since
February 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
