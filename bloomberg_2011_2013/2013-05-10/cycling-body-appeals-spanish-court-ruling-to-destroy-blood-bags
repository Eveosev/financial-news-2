Cycling’s governing body will appeal
the decision by a Spanish judge to destroy 200 blood bags
belonging to cyclists and other athletes after an anti-doping
trial.  The ruling by Judge Patricia Santamaria came after a trial
of Eufemiano Fuentes, a sports doctor who gave transfusions to
Tour de  France  riders to boost their performance. The bags were
found in his possession, and the World Anti-Doping Agency was
among groups looking to identify the athletes involved in so-called blood-doping, which is banned in sports. The Union
Cycliste Internationale, known as UCI, said it will appeal.  “The UCI can confirm that it will appeal the decision of
the Madrid court of April 29 not to release to the UCI and other
anti-doping organizations the more than 200 bags of blood and
other evidence gathered in police raids in 2006, which were
presented in the trial of Spanish doctor Eufemiano Fuentes,”
the governing body said today in an e-mail.  The UCI and WADA wanted to take disciplinary proceedings
against athletes who haven’t faced sanctions as a result of a
2006 investigation in  Madrid  called “Operacion Puerto,” or
Operation Mountain Pass. As few as a dozen of the 58 cyclists
that police linked to the doping ring, and no one from other
sports, have received bans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
