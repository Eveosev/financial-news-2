Some Czech policy makers see an
increased likelihood that the central bank will need to sell the
koruna to ease monetary conditions, minutes from the bank’s May
2 policy meeting showed today.  The Ceska Narodni Banka left the benchmark  two-week 
repurchase rate at 0.05 percent for a fourth meeting last week.
After three rate cuts last year exhausted the scope for further
reductions, rate setters are debating whether to sell the koruna
for the first time in more than a decade.  “Several members of the bank board expressed an opinion
that, in light of new data, the likelihood of need for further
monetary easing through foreign-exchange interventions has
increased,” according to the minutes, published today on the
central bank’s website. The board agreed that “the risk of
deflation isn’t visible.”  The $217 billion  economy  has contracted for five
consecutive quarters, the longest streak since records began in
1996, as households and businesses spend less because of
government austerity policies and  Europe ’s debt crisis. A weaker
 exchange rate  would boost exports that account for about 80
percent of economic output, increase import prices and limit
deflation risks.  The koruna is currently weaker than the central bank’s
forecast, which is already easing monetary conditions, and low
domestic economic activity is a reason for more  currency
depreciation , at least one policy maker said, according to the
minutes.  Most members of the bank board agreed that the economy
isn’t showing signs of a recovery in the near future.  To contact the reporter on this story:
