Corn futures declined, after the
biggest one-day rally this month, on speculation that the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  may predict a record harvest in the
U.S., the largest grower.  Corn for July delivery lost as much as 0.5 percent to
$6.455 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after rising 2.5
percent yesterday on concern rains in the Midwest will further
delay planting that’s already off to the slowest start since
1984. Futures traded at $6.465 by 11:35 a.m. in  Singapore ,
heading for a 2.2 percent loss this week.  This year’s U.S. harvest will probably surge 31 percent to
358.7 million metric tons from a year earlier, when the nation
suffered the worst drought since the 1930s, according to the
average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The USDA is
due to release its outlook on the next crop in  Washington  today.  “Market participants want to sell for profit-taking before
the USDA releases its report,” Makiko Tsugata, an analyst at
Market Risk Advisory Co., wrote in an e-mail today.  Wheat for July delivery fell as much as 0.5 percent to
$7.1975 a bushel, before trading at $7.2125. Soybeans for July
delivery were little changed at $14.09 a bushel, poised for a
weekly advance of 1.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
