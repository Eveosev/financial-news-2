Palm oil  inventories in China, the
world’s second-biggest importer after  India , rose to a record as
inbound shipments outpaced consumption, according to China
Cereals & Oils Business Net.  Stockpiles at the country’s major ports this week exceeded
1.5 million metric tons, compared with 1.46 million tons a month
ago, Liu Xianwu, general manager of the Beijing-based research
firm, said in an interview today.  High inventories may begin to slow China’s  purchases  and
weigh down prices, which have fallen 4.6 percent on Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives this year after slumping 23 percent in
2012. Liu maintained his forecast from last month that imports
will reach 5.95 million tons for the 12 months through Sept. 30,
little changed from a year ago.  “The high inventory will persist in the next few months,
which will exert pressure on prices and slow imports,” he said
by phone from Beijing.  Monthly imports from April to September may be about
400,000 tons to 500,000 tons, compared with 591,223 tons in
March, Gao Yanbin, director of research at Jinshi Futures Co.,
said by phone from  Shanghai .  “Some big companies are saying they won’t import anymore
in the next few months and instead they’ll buy the cheap and
abundant supply already imported,” Gao said. “If that’s the
case, we won’t see much growth in China’s imports.”  Crude palm oil for July delivery rose 1.7 percent to 2,326
ringgit ($778) a ton at 3:42 p.m. local time on the Malaysian
bourse. The contract on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange , which is
for refined palm oil after adjusting for import taxes and
processing, rose 2.6 percent to close at 6,120  yuan  ($996) a
ton.  Indonesia and Malaysia are the world’s biggest producers of
the tropical oil and India is the largest buyer.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
