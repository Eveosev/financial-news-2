OTP Bank Nyrt. , Hungary’s largest
lender, fell from the highest level in almost three months after
Economy Minister  Mihaly Varga  said he may raise taxes on banking
transactions.  The shares  declined  0.5 percent to 4,864 forint by the
close in Budapest, trimming this week’s advance to 1.8 percent.
The benchmark BUX stock  index  fell 0.1 percent today.  A tax on transactions such as cash withdrawals and money
transfers is bringing in less revenue than expected and may have
to be raised, Varga said on HirTV late yesterday. OTP pared an
earlier slide of  as much as  3.2 percent after Varga told
reporters today the government will only increase the levy and
other taxes on banks if alternative ways of meeting European
Union fiscal targets are exhausted.  “While it is a relief for OTP that no painful steps are
planned for the banking sector with immediate effect, the threat
is still there,”  Akos Kuti , head of research at broker Equilor
Befektetesi Zrt., said by phone from Budapest today.  Hungary still sees its budget deficit at 2.7 percent of
gross domestic product this year, below the EU’s 3 percent
limit, even without any further measures, Varga said. The
Cabinet is preparing steps to convince the European Commission
that the goals are attainable, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
