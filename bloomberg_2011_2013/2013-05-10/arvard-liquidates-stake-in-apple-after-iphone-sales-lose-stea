Harvard University, the world’s
wealthiest university, has liquidated its stake in Apple Inc. as
the iPhone maker’s shares tumbled after reaching a record high
of $702.10 in September.  The university, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
and has a $30.7 billion endowment, sold shares valued at about
$304,000, according to a quarterly filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. The sale comes as growth in
demand for the iPhone has lost steam and investors and consumers
await new products from Tim Cook, the chief executive officer
who replaced  Steve Jobs .  Harvard’s endowment owns about $1.1 billion of publicly-traded securities, according to the filing that was released
today and reflects the university’s holdings as of March 31. It
also liquidated $42.3 million of shares in Warnaco Group Inc.,
as well as a number of exchange-traded funds.  Kevin Galvin, a spokesman for Harvard, declined to comment
in an e-mail.  Among acquisitions by Harvard Management Co. in the first
quarter was a $136.2 million stake in  HJ Heinz Co. (HNZ) , which is
being acquired by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  and
Jorge Paulo Lemann’s 3G Capital.  Apple shares fell less than 1 percent to $452.97 at the
close in New York. They are down 35 percent since the record
high.  To contact the reporters on this story:
