There are a million amazing places to visit on the other side of the Pacific—we devoted  the entire April issue to Asia . But we wanted a place that would feel both relaxing and stimulating…cutting-edge and still undiscovered. Requirements: Instagram-ready architecture, interesting hotels, fab food, nightlife, Twitter access. We've found it in Malaysia's island-city of George Town, in the state of Penang. Here, Singaporeans prowl the narrow streets for hawker food that's rich in Indian, Malay, and Chinese flavors; Kuala Lumpur's denizens peruse contemporary Malay art in historic Chinese galleries like  Galeri Seni Mutiara  (118 Lebuh Armenian; 60-4-262-0167); and everyone else is content just lying on the white sand beaches a few blocks from the action in town. Sound ideal? Then do two things. First, book a room at the right-now  Macalister Mansion , whose heritage facade belies modern-meets-Deco interiors and flourishes like a swim-up bar (60-4-228-3888; doubles from $224). It even made our  Hot List . Then check out the overnight itinerary we created below. Hey, it could be the start of our next grand tour. George Town Musts FOR DRINKING AND SHOPPING China House, a row of 1800s-era shophouses turned into a gallery, shops with handwoven textiles, a bar, and restaurants (153-155 Beach St.). FOR A DAY-TRIP Pack a picnic from La Bohème (42 Jalan Sri Bahari) and go to Taman Negara Pulau Pinang, a national park of jungle and coconut-shaded beaches an hour’s taxi ride away (60-4-881-3530). FOR PEOPLE WATCHING  23 Love Lane  hotel’s bar is where stylish locals drink Singapore slings and play charades. Upstairs, inexpensive rooms are set around a garden (60-4-262-1323; doubles from $160).

The trendier seek Eighty Eight for pork belly cooked for36 hours in wine and Malay citrus (49-A Jalan Kelawai; 60-4-226-2821; entrees from $20). 11 P.M.: Time for bed: The new  Macalister Mansion  has a preserved British heritage exterior and new adds like a mosaic pool with swim-up bar, and modern-meets-deco interiors (60-4-228-3888; doubles from $310).
