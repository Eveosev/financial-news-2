AS Olainfarm , a Latvian drugmaker
with sales in 30 countries, extended record gains as Swedbank AB
raised its share-price estimate for the stock after the company
got a tax break from the government.  The stock rose as much as 4.5 percent in Riga and closed up
2.7 percent at 5.01 lats, the highest since trading began in
1998. Volume of 9,782 shares was the equivalent of 183 percent
of the three-month daily average, according to data complied by
Bloomberg. The shares have jumped 36 percent this year,
extending last year’s 50 percent increase and valuing the
company at 70.6 million lats ($131 million).  Swedbank raised its price estimate to 5.1 lats from 4.8
lats after Olainfarm said on May 8 that the Latvian government
had given it a tax exemption of as much as 5.2 million lats for
investments in new products and capacity.  The bank cut its recommendation to neutral from buy, citing
“the recent rally in the share price,”  Marek Randma , head of
Baltic equity research, said in a note yesterday, when the
Latvian stock market was closed for a European holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
