Copper declined, paring a third
weekly advance, on speculation that inflation may accelerate in
 China , curbing further stimulus. Tin also dropped.  Copper for delivery in three months lost as much as 1.1
percent to $7,275.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange
before trading at $7,345 as of 9:55 a.m. Shanghai time. The
metal has gained 1 percent so far this week, poised for a third
weekly climb.  China can’t be “blindly optimistic” about its inflation
outlook at a time when uncertainties remain in areas such as
property and farm produce prices, the country’s central bank
said in its quarterly monetary policy report. The nation’s
consumer prices gained 2.4 percent in April from a year ago, as
producer prices fell 2.6 percent, the statistics bureau said
yesterday.  “Concerns over China’s demand persist, weighing on copper
prices,” said Wang Jingjing, an analyst at Founder Futures Co.
“However, looking at the physical market, we do see a bit
improvement, which is also evidenced by inventory drawdown, so
we might see further gains.”  Metal for delivery in September fell 0.4 percent to 52,760
 yuan  ($8,606) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, as July
copper futures on the Comex in  New York  declined 0.6 percent to
$3.32 per pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
