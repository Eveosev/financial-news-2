South Africa  may fine banks that
violate new rules governing unsecured lending, according to the
association representing the country’s lenders.  “There may be fines -- we’ll have to put it to the
regulators,” Cas Coovadia, managing director of the Banking
Association of South Africa, said in an interview at the  World
Economic Forum  in  Cape Town  yesterday. “There has been some
abuse of unsecured lending.”  The association agreed with South Africa’s National
Treasury on Nov. 1 to tighten rules for loans not backed by
assets after the number of consumers with bad debt rose to a
record.  African Bank Investments Ltd. (ABL) , the country’s largest
provider of unsecured loans, said on May 2 that first-half
profit declined after higher bad debt charges.  “I don’t think we have a bubble bursting,” Coovadia said.
“African Bank is not systemic for the industry. If we tighten
the rules and make it more transparent, the banks will be happy
because it removes the reputational issues around unsecured
lending.”  The amended rules for the industry will cover so-called
garnishee orders, which lenders obtain from magistrate courts to
instruct employers to dock workers’ salaries and pay the money
over to creditors.  The industry will be in a position to “introduce some
message of confidence in unsecured lending,” by the middle of
June, Coovadia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
