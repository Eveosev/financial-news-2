Vina Concha y Toro SA , Chile’s
largest wine exporter, rose the most since August after bulk-wine prices fell to a three-year low, driving down the company’s
costs.  Concha y Toro advanced 3.2 percent to 937.23 pesos today in
Santiago, the biggest increase on a closing basis since Aug. 3.
Volume was almost five times the daily average of the past three
months. The Ipsa benchmark index fell 0.7 percent.  “The lower costs will take some time to be reflected in
their profits, but there are investors that are buying in
advance,” Isabel Darrigrandi, an analyst at Grupo BTG Pactual,
said in a telephone interview from Santiago.  Prices for bulk wine, the source for 65 percent of Concha y
Toro’s production, retreated in southern  Chile ’s Maule region
last month to 12,000 pesos per arroba, a measure of volume that
represents about 40 liters. The price is down 32 percent from a
year before and is the lowest since February 2010, according to
data from Chile’s agricultural statistics agency  Odepa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
