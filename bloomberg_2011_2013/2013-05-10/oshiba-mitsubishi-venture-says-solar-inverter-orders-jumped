Toshiba Mitsubishi-Electric
Industrial Systems Corp. said orders for solar inverters jumped
nearly 18-fold last fiscal year as an incentive program boosted
panel installations.  Orders for inverters that allow solar power to be fed into
grids jumped to 1,068 megawatts from 61 megawatts in the 12
months ended March 31, the venture between  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and
 Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (6503)  said in a statement yesterday.  Japan  began offering above-market rates for clean energy in
July to promote renewable sources such as wind and solar after
the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis.  Actual shipments soared to 472 megawatts for the year ended
March 31 from 42 megawatts, according to the statement.  Annual production is planned to increase to more than 2,000
megawatts by July from 1,500 megawatts currently, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
