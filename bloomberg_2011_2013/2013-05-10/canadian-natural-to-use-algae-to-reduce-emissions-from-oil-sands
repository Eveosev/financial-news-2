Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., (CNQ) 
Canada’s third-largest oil producer by market value, plans to
reduce carbon emissions at its  oil-sands  operations by using the
greenhouse gas to grow algae.  Canadian Natural will partner with Pond Biofuels Inc., a
Toronto-based biomass producer, and the National Research
Council Canada on a pilot project in northern Alberta that will
reduce CO2 output at the oil producer’s Horizon site by as much
as 15 percent, President  Steve Laut  said in Calgary today.  Canadian oil-sands producers are under pressure to reduce
the environmental footprint of bitumen production as rising
output boosts greenhouse-gas emissions. The Alberta and Canadian
governments have been promoting efforts to strengthen oil sands
regulations while lobbying European Union officials who want to
penalize fuel derived from Canadian bitumen as part of a
proposed fuel-quality directive.  As part of the C$19 million ($18.78 million) project,
carbon dioxide will be captured from flue gas and then fed into
tanks with waste water and algae. Natural oils from the plants
will be extracted and added to the oil, while the remaining
biomass will be used as fertilizer for land reclamation, Joy
Romero, Canadian Natural’s vice president of technology
development, said in an interview.  The project will begin operations at the end of the year,
she said.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  and  Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  are Canada’s
biggest oil producers by market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
