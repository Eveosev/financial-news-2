Sergio Garcia  birdied five
consecutive holes during the second round of golf’s Players
championship and headed into the weekend holding a one-shot lead
over  Tiger Woods .  Garcia, a Spaniard, is at 11 under par after a 65 yesterday
at the  U.S. PGA Tour ’s marquee event. His 7-under score matched
his career low at the TPC Sawgrass course in Ponte Vedra Beach,
Florida. Garcia had eight birdies and one bogey in his round,
which ended with birdies on six of his final eight holes.  Woods tallied his second consecutive 5-under 67 yesterday
with four birdies, an eagle and a bogey. The 2001 Players
championship winner, Woods enters today’s third round one shot
in front of Kevin Chappell of the U.S., England’s  Lee Westwood 
and Henrik Stenson of Sweden.  First-round leader Roberto Castro, a 27-year-old American
making his first appearance at the Players, had a 6-over 78
yesterday after tying the course record with an opening-round 63
and is eight shots off the lead.  The Players is golf’s richest tournament with a $9.5
million purse. The winner will receive $1.71 million.  Vijay Singh  of Fiji missed the cut for weekend play with a
1-over score through two rounds. Singh, 50, on May 8 sued the
 PGA Tour  claiming he was publicly humiliated by a suspension for
using deer-antler spray before he was cleared of wrongdoing two
months later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
