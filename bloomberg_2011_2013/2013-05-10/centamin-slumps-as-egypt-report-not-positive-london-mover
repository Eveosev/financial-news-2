Centamin Plc (CEY) , a producer of gold in
 Egypt , fell the most in almost than five months in  London  as it
said a report by the State Commissioner’s Office was “not
positive” as it appeals the annulment of its mine lease.  Centamin tumbled as much as 21 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Dec. 13, and traded 6.1 pence lower at
39.55 pence by 10:20 a.m. in London. Centamin said its appeal
will be held on June 19.  “The Egyptian State Commissioner’s Office has produced a
report containing non-binding recommendations,” Centamin said
in a statement. “Whilst these recommendations are not positive,
the company does not believe that they address the substantive
merits of Centamin’s appeal and as such the company’s grounds of
appeal remain unchanged.”  Centamin is appealing against an Oct. 30 preliminary ruling
by Egypt’s administrative court to annul its 18-year-old
concession agreement with the government for the Sukari gold
mine. The company has fallen more than 50 percent in London in
each of the past two years. It has been dogged by operational
and political delays since the uprising that led to the ousting
of former President  Hosni Mubarak .  “The Office’s recommendations are advisory only and non-binding, but the apparent negative undertone has potential to
make the appeal more challenging,” Numis Securities Ltd. said
in a note. Centamin “stock is likely to remain under pressure
until a full resolution is reached.”  Centamin said it’s preparing for the appeal hearing and
will “vigorously defend its rights” to the Sukari mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
