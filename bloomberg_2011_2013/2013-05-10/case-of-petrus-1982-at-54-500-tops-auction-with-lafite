A case of Chateau Petrus 1982 Pomerol
fetched the top price at a Christie’s International Plc wine
auction in  London  earlier this month, selling for 35,100 pounds
($54,500) including fees, according to the auction house.  Twelve bottles of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 Pauillac
sold for 26,910 pounds at the auction, a case of Chateau Lafleur
1982 Pomerol fetched 25,740 pounds and a magnum of Chateau
Cheval Blanc 1947 attracted a winning bid of 15,210 pounds.  Investor demand has revived after a 17-month price slide
which started in July 2011, boosting the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50
Index by 9 percent since November. The index, which fell in
April after posting four straight monthly gains, is still up
more than 5 percent so far this year, while the Liv-ex Fine Wine
100 Index, calculated monthly, has risen 5.9 percent.  The market benchmark “is well below trend, so there’s a
fair bit of recovery potential just getting back to the trend
line,” said Chris Smith, investment manager at The Wine
Investment Fund in London. The fund, invested in Bordeaux, has
about $50 million under management. “On a long view, we still
prefer the more mature vintages to the younger ones.”  The sale raised a total of 1.24 billion pounds and was 93
percent sold by lot and value, according to Christie’s.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
