Steel reinforcement-bar futures pared
the first weekly gain in four after China’s biggest steelmaker
cut product prices for the first time in nine months.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.9 percent to 3,587 a metric ton ($584)
and was at 3,611  yuan  at 11:24 a.m. in Beijing. The most-active
contract has climbed 0.8 percent this week.  Baoshan Iron & Steel Co. (600019)  cut rates of hot-rolled products
for June delivery by 180 yuan a ton and of cold-rolled products
by 150 yuan, according to information posted on its website
 yesterday . The last time Shanghai-based Baoshan cut prices was
on Aug. 10 for September delivery, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Baoshan Steel cutting price reflects its bearish view on
the market, which counters optimism seen earlier this month,”
Shi Yuchen, an analyst at Guoxin Futures Co., said by phone from
Shanghai.  The average  spot price  for rebar was unchanged at 3,593
yuan a ton yesterday, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co. Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port was little changed
at $130.20 a dry ton, Steel Index Ltd. data show.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
