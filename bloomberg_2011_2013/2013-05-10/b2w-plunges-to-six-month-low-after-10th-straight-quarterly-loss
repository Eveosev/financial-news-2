B2W Cia. Digital,  Brazil ’s largest
online retailer, plunged to a six-month low after posting its
10th straight quarterly loss.  The shares tumbled 7.7 percent to 10.85 reais at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo, the lowest since Nov. 14. The stock was
the second-worst performer on the country’s benchmark  Ibovespa (IBOV) 
gauge, which fell 0.6 percent.  The Sao-Paulo based company reported a first-quarter net
loss of 61.1 million reais ($30.2 million), according to a
regulatory filing yesterday after the market closed. The company
had been projected to post an adjusted net loss of 46.3 million
reais, based on the average estimate of five analysts  surveyed 
by Bloomberg.  “Although top-line growth was solid, sales expenses
continue to grow at a faster-than-expected rate,” Banco
Santander Brasil SA analysts including Tobias Stingelin wrote in
a research note today. “We acknowledge some improvements, but
the cash flow drain remains strong.”  Cash sales expenses surged 31 percent from a year earlier
and were 7 percent higher than Santander analysts had estimated.  “Investments to improve customer service continue to raise
its expense structure,” the Santander analysts wrote.  B2W has lost 36 percent this year while the Ibovespa
slumped 9.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
