Billionaire investor Sam Zell,
chairman of Equity Group Investments, said he sees fewer
opportunities in real estate investments and that stocks are
overvalued.  “You would think with demand weakening, the stock market
would reflect that,” Zell, 71, said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television’s  Erik Schatzker  at the SkyBridge
Alternatives Conference yesterday in Las Vegas. “I think about
the headwinds in the world today, and I look at S&P, and I do
not know how you can be wildly optimistic.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index surged  14 percent  this year
through yesterday amid optimism central banks will continue to
use stimulus to support economic growth. Orders placed with
factories fell more than forecast in March as a cooling economy
slowed demand for metals, mining equipment and military goods,
according to Commerce Department data reported on May 3.  Zell, chairman of  Equity Residential (EQR) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. apartment landlord, said he continues to believe
multifamily buildings are a good investment and sees fewer
opportunities in other parts of the property market. He said
real estate now represents about 30 percent of his holdings, a
record low.  “The multifamily market is terrific,” he said. “I think
the multifamily market will continue to prosper regardless of
what happens to the single-family market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
