Cocoa fell to the lowest level this
month in New York and London on speculation prices that rallied
in the past two months climbed too far as supplies will probably
be enough to meet demand. Sugar advanced and coffee slid.  Futures gained 11 percent in New York and 9.4 percent in
London in March and April as speculators boosted bets on higher
prices. Global cocoa production will outpace consumption by
11,000 metric tons in the 2012-13 season ending Sept. 30,
Macquarie Group Ltd. estimated on May 3. That reverses a
previous forecast for a shortage as abundant rainfall and good
sunshine improved the outlook for the the smaller of two annual
harvests, known as the mid-crop, in top producer  Ivory Coast ,
the bank said.  “An overdue correction looks to be beginning,” Sterling Smith, a futures specialist at Citigroup Inc. in  Chicago , said
in a report e-mailed yesterday. “The market does look poised to
at least test support at the $2,300 a ton area.”  Cocoa for July delivery slipped 0.9 percent to $2,328 a ton
by 5:31 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The beans used to
make chocolate fell to as much as $2,321 a ton, the lowest for a
most-active contract since April 30. Cocoa for July delivery
fell 0.3 percent to 1,537 pounds ($2,365) a ton on NYSE Liffe in
London.  Speculators boosted bets on rising cocoa prices in  New York 
to 31,810 contracts in New York in the week ended April 30, the
biggest net-long position since 2008, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data compiled by Bloomberg showed. In London,
money managers increased best on higher prices to a 5-month high
in the same period, according to NYSE Liffe data.  London Backwardation  In London, cocoa for delivery in May was 18 pounds a ton
more expensive than the futures for July, reversing a discount
of 4 pounds a ton a week earlier. That market structure, in
which earlier dated contracts price above later ones is known as
backwardation and may signal limited supplies for now. The May
futures switched to being more expensive yesterday.  Arabica coffee futures for July delivery were 0.1 percent
lower at $1.4775 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee futures for July
delivery were little changed at $2,044 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Coffee production in  Vietnam , the largest grower of robusta
beans, may climb 4.9 percent to 1.5 million tons in the 12
months starting October from 1.43 million tons a year earlier,
according to the median of 10 trader and shipper estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the highest since a record
1.65 million tons in 2011-2012. Output will gain as rain this
month ended drought in the main producing region.  Raw sugar for delivery in July rose 0.4 percent to 17.54
cents a pound in New York. White, or refined, sugar for delivery
in August gained 0.3 percent to $487.70 a ton in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
