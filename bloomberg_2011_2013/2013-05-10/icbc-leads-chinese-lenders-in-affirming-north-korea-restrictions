China ’s two biggest banks said
they’re complying with international efforts to isolate North
Korean financial institutions that support the country’s
ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.  North Korea ’s Foreign Trade Bank doesn’t have an account
with  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd ., a press officer
for China’s largest lender by assets said today, asking not to
be identified due to company policy.  China Construction Bank
Corp. (939) , the second-largest, doesn’t have business relations with
any North Korean banks, said a press officer, who asked not to
be identified because of company rules . ICBC and CCB are
majority-owned by the Chinese government.  China and the U.S. last month set out a joint commitment to
end North Korea’s attempt to develop nuclear weapons. The U.S.
Treasury department froze American assets of Foreign Trade Bank,
the North’s primary foreign exchange lender, in March after the
 United Nations Security Council  unanimously agreed to new
sanctions in response to a nuclear weapons test.  China Construction Bank strictly follows Chinese
regulations and UN Security Council resolutions, the Beijing-based lender’s press officer said.  Bank of China Ltd. , the country’s fourth-largest, said this
week it had closed Foreign Trade Bank’s account and ended all
fund transfers related to it.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
