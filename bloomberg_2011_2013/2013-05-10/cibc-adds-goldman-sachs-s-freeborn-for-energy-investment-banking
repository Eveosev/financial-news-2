Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce,
the country’s fifth-biggest lender, hired Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.’s  Michael Freeborn  as head of energy investment banking.  Freeborn will oversee that business from Calgary, the
Toronto-based firm said today in an internal memo. He’ll replace
Mark Horsfall, who was appointed vice-chairman of investment
banking starting in August, the firm said.  Freeborn previously led Goldman Sachs’s Canadian energy
investment banking business from Calgary. Before joining the New
York-based firm in 2005, he worked for CIBC in both Calgary and
Toronto. He’ll report to  Geoff Belsher , group co-head of
wholesale banking, according to the memo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
