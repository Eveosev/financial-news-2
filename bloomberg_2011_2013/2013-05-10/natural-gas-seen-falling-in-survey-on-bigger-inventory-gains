Natural gas futures may decline next
week as moderate weather limits demand for the power-plant and
heating fuel, boosting stockpiles, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Eight of 14 analysts, or 57 percent, predicted that futures
will decline on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through May 17.
Four, or 29 percent, said gas will advance and two predicted
that prices will stay the same. Last week, 58 percent of
participants said gas would decline.  No extreme temperatures are likely across the lower 48
states through May 23 as weather is forecast to be near seasonal
for the Midwest, East and South, according to Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland .  Gas futures have slumped 10 percent since rising to $4.444
per million British thermal units, a 21-month high, on May 1
after government data showed consecutive larger-than-expected
stockpile gains.  ’’A combination of strong storage builds over the next few
weeks and a lack of stressful weather will be the prime
catalysts for lower prices,’’  Martin King , an analyst with
FirstEnergy Capital Corp in Calgary, said in an e-mail
yesterday. ’’I believe prices will pull back to around the $3.75
per million Btu range, but not much lower.’’  Natural gas futures dropped 13.1 cents, or 3.2 percent, to
$3.91 per million Btu this week on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, capping a third straight weekly decline. Prices are up
17 percent this year.  Inventory Gain  U.S. inventories  increased by 88 billion cubic feet to
1.865 trillion in the week ended May 3, higher than the five-year average gain of 69 billion for the period, the Energy
Information Administration said.  Analyst estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg predicted an increase of 86 billion.  A  supply deficit  versus the historic norm narrowed for the
first time in 11 weeks to 5 percent from 6.2 percent the
previous week, which was the biggest such gap since February
2011, according to data from the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical arm. A deficit versus year-earlier levels narrowed
to 28.3 percent from 30.9 percent.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 50 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex gas futures will probably
rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This week’s
results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  4      8      2  To contact the reporter on this story:
