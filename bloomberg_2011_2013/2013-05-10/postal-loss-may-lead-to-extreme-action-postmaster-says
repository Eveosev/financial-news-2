The U.S. Postal Service added to its
losses in the second quarter and is closer to needing “extreme
action” to keep it afloat, Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe
said.  Donahoe said that without legislation to change the
service’s business model, mounting losses will necessitate
heeding the postal board’s call to ask labor unions to reopen
contracts and to consider raising postal rates.  “At some point our financial liabilities become so large
that they cannot be fixed without taking extreme action,”
Donahoe said today at a board meeting in  Washington . “We don’t
want to get to the point where extreme action is the only
option.”  The service lost $1.9 billion in its second quarter ending
March 31, narrowing the loss from $3.2 billion a year earlier in
the same quarter as it reduced its workforce by nearly 5
percent, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Corbett said at the
meeting.  The service is a government agency that is supposed to be
self-supporting from postage sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
