Germany’s government bonds fell,
heading for a second weekly decline, as a report showed the
nation’s  exports (GRBTEXMM)  increased in March.  German  10-year yields  approached the highest level in four
weeks. Exports rose 0.5 percent in March after falling a revised
1.2 percent a month earlier, the Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden said. Imports increased 0.8 percent. Data on May 8
showed  industrial production  in  Europe ’s largest economy
unexpectedly increased in the same month. Italy is scheduled to
sell 10 billion euros ($13 billion) of bills.  Germany’s 10-year bund yield rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 1.30 percent at 7:16 a.m. London time.
The rate has increased six basis points this week and rose to
1.31 percent on May 7, the most since April 11. The 1.5 percent
security maturing in February 2023 fell 0.3, or 3 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 101.80.  Italy plans to sell 3 billion euros of 219-day bills and 7
billion euros of 12-month debt today. It last sold one-year
securities on April 10 at an average yield of 0.922 percent.  German  government bonds  returned 0.7 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Italian securities gained 5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
