Hog futures fell to the lowest in
more than two weeks on signs of slowing pork demand in China,
the world’s biggest consumer of the meat. Cattle prices also
declined.  China will stockpile pork for the second time this year to
stabilize prices, which have been low, the Ministry of Commerce
said today in a statement. The stockpiling will occur “soon,”
it said. Last year, China was the third-largest buyer of pork
from the U.S., where exports are down 16 percent in the three
months through March 31, the most-recent government data show.  Rising supply in China “doesn’t help us, and that doesn’t
help world pork prices,”  Lawrence Kane , a market adviser at
Stewart-Peterson Group in Yates City, Illinois, said in a
telephone interview. “They’re just not going to be out on the
world market looking for anything.”  Hog futures for June settlement slid 0.2 percent to 90.375
cents a pound at 10:07 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
after reaching 90 cents, the lowest for the most-active contract
since April 24. Prices are down 2 percent this week, heading for
the biggest drop since February.  Japan and Mexico are the largest buyers of U.S. pork,
according to the USDA.  Cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1.20325 a pound. Prices are up 3.4 percent in the past 12
months through yesterday. Feeder-cattle futures for August
settlement rose less than 0.1 percent to $1.4605 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
