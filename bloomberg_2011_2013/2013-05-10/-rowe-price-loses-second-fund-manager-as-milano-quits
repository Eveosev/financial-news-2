T. Rowe Price lost its second  fund
manager  in three months today when Joseph M. Milano, manager of
the $4 billion  New America Growth (PRWAX)  Fund, quit.  “He resigned effective at the end of the day to pursue
other investment-management opportunities,” Brian Lewbart, a
spokesman for the Baltimore-based firm, said in an interview.  New America Growth returned an annual average of 7 percent
over the past five years, beating 77 percent of competing funds.
Milano will be replaced by Daniel Martino, manager of the $2.5
billion Media & Telecommunications Fund since 2009, according to
Bloomberg data. That fund has returned an average 21 percent in
the past three years, topping 87 percent of rivals.  Kris Jenner, the firm’s top stock-picker, left T. Rowe
Price with two analysts in February to start a hedge-fund firm,
Rock Springs Capital. He formerly managed the $6.2 billion
Health Sciences Fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
