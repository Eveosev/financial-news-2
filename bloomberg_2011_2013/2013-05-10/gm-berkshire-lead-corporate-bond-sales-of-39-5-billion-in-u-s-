General Motors Co. (GM) ’s finance unit and
billionaire  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  led dollar-denominated sales of at least $42.1 billion this week as
relative yields narrowed.  General Motors Financial Co. sold $2.5 billion in its first
issue in almost nine months while Berkshire Hathaway Finance
Corp. raised $1 billion in its second sale this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales slowed from $46.4 billion
in the previous period, the busiest in six weeks with  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s record $17 billion issue.  Berkshire found demand for its two-part offering even after
Chief Executive Officer Buffett said four days earlier that with
yields at record lows, the parent of insurers Geico and General
Re isn’t buying corporate bonds. Investors are seeking higher
returns with company debentures as the  Federal Reserve  holds
 interest rates  at almost zero for a fifth year and undertakes
$85 billion in monthly bond purchases to stimulate the economy.  “There are still opportunities out there, but we’re having
to work a little harder,” John Lekas, chief executive officer
at Portland, Oregon-based Leader Capital Corp., said in a
telephone interview. Lekas’s  Leader Total Return Fund (LCTIX)  has beaten
94 percent of its peers this year. “Issuance has trimmed down a
little bit for the week, but it seems like it’s right on
track.”  GM Offering  Yields on U.S. corporate debt declined to 3.385 percent
yesterday from 3.395 percent on May 3, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show. The extra yield investors demand to own
corporate bonds rather than government debentures narrowed 3
basis points to 201 basis points yesterday, the data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  GM Financial issued $1 billion of 2.75 percent, three-year
notes yielding 241 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $750 million each of 3.25 percent, five-year
securities with a relative yield of 250 basis points and 4.25
percent 10-year bonds at a 247 basis-point spread, according to
Bloomberg data.  Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $30.9
billion, compared with  $39.8 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of $24.4 billion, Bloomberg data show.  Yields on investment-grade bonds were little changed at
2.71 percent for the week through yesterday, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate index. Spreads
tightened 2 basis points to 143 basis points.  Cash Hoard  Berkshire, whose cash hoard reached a record $49.1 billion
in its first quarter, sold $500 million of 1.3 percent, five-year debt with a 57 basis-point spread and an equal portion of
4.3 percent, 30-year bonds with a relative yield of 135 basis
points, Bloomberg data show. The issuance secured the Omaha,
Nebraska-based company’s lowest coupons for those maturities
ever.  Offerings of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $11.2
billion, compared with  $6.6 billion  last week and a 2013 weekly
average of $8.2 billion, Bloomberg data show.  Yields on junk debt declined to a record low of 5.984
percent yesterday from 6.048 percent on May 3, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield index. Spreads
tightened 10 basis points to 423 basis points.  High-risk, high-yield bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody’s
Investors Service and lower than BBB- at  Standard & Poor’s .  Issuers planning sales include  emerging markets  mobile-phone operator Millicom International Cellular SA and Eskom
Holdings SOC Ltd., the South African power utility that’s
building the world’s third- and fourth-biggest coal-fired
plants. Eskom will sell more than $1 billion of bonds this year,
its Chief Executive Officer  Brian Dames  said in an interview at
the World Economic Forum for Africa in Cape Town.  To contact the reporter on this story:
