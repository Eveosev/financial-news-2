Malaysia ’s bonds and the ringgit
rallied this week, with the 10-year yield dropping to its lowest
level in more than four years, after Prime Minister Najib Razak
was re-elected, clearing the way to pursue his economic reforms.  Borrowing costs on the 3.48 percent government notes due
March 2023 dropped six basis points today and 20 basis points
from May 3 to 3.19 percent as of 11:11 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest for a
benchmark 10-year  note  since February 2009. The decline in
yields is 11 times the average move in the past three months,
the most among 22 emerging debt markets tracked by Bloomberg.  Najib’s coalition won 133 of the 222 seats in parliament in
the May 5 election, while opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim’s
alliance secured 89 seats. The premier has embarked on a $444
billion spending spree to boost infrastructure and has vowed to
cut the budget deficit in an effort to elevate the nation to
developed status by 2020.  “The initial stronger reaction is because the elections
have passed and without the boat being rocked too much,” said
 Vishnu Varathan , a Singapore-based economist at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. “Investors were guaranteed the economic
transformation program would continue.”  Varathan said the momentum in the ringgit started to fade
toward the end of the week as demand for the dollar increased.
The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against six major
currencies, climbed 0.7 percent in the five days to 82.725.  Monetary Easing  The ringgit dropped 0.5 percent to 2.9870 per dollar in
Kuala Lumpur, paring its weekly advance to 1.6 percent, the
biggest since the period ended Sept. 14, 2012, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It reached 2.9570 on May 7, the strongest since
August 2011.  Three-month non-deliverable forwards declined 0.5 percent
today to 3.0042 per dollar, trimming the week’s gain to 1.5
percent. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected
moves in the exchange rate used to price options, climbed 29
basis points, or 0.29 percentage point, to 6.94 percent today.  Najib vowed to cut subsidies on fuel and electricity in an
effort to lower the budget deficit, which the finance ministry
plans to reduce to 4 percent of gross domestic product in 2013,
according to its 2012/2013 economic report released Sept. 28.
The nation has posted a shortfall very year since 1998. It was
4.5 percent of GDP in 2012.  South  Korea  unexpectedly lowered its benchmark interest
rate yesterday to 2.5 percent from 2.75 percent, a move
predicted by only five of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg,
while the rest saw no change. Malaysia’s central bank kept
borrowing costs at 3 percent yesterday. It has remained at that
level since May 2011.  “With the election uncertainty removed, foreign investors
started buying the ringgit as the return of the ruling coalition
ensures economic stability,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a
strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in  Singapore . “Malaysian
bonds are rallying because there is a potential for monetary
easing given the recent rate cut in Korea.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
