Eastern  Europe ’s economic-growth
prospects have worsened as the region’s largest economies,
Russia and  Poland , are slowing “significantly,” the  European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development  said.  The 30 eastern European and central Asian countries where
the EBRD invests will expand 2.1 percent this year, the London-based bank said today in an e-mailed statement, cutting its
January forecast of 3 percent. The economies expanded 2.5
percent last year and will grow 3.1 percent in 2014, the EBRD
predicted.  While the effects of Europe’s debt crisis are “abating,”
the biggest downside risk for the east is the lack of policies
to promote growth in the developed part of the continent as
euro-area recession extends to a second year, the EBRD said. The
London-based lender is calling on emerging European governments
to overhaul services such as health care and pension systems to
lay the foundations of long-term growth.  The slowdown “is a wakeup call across the region to re-energise structural reforms that have been on hold since the
start of the crisis,” EBRD Chief Economist  Erik Berglof  said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
