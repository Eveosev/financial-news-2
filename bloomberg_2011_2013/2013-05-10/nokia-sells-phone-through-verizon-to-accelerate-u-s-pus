Nokia Oyj , the Finnish mobile-phone
maker trying to win back users from Apple Inc. and Samsung
Electronics Co., struck a deal with  Verizon Wireless  to sell its
new flagship smartphone.  The largest U.S. mobile carrier will start selling the
Lumia 928 on May 16 for $99 after a $50 mail-in rebate and a
two-year contract. The phone has a 4.5-inch (11.4-centimeter)
screen and an 8.7 megapixel camera, and it can be charged
cordlessly, Nokia said today in a statement. It runs on
Microsoft Corp.’s Windows Phone software like other Lumias.  The device marks the first time a high-end Lumia will be
sold by Basking Ridge, New Jersey-based Verizon Wireless, which
has about 100 million customers. Nokia, based in Espoo, Finland,
has struggled to turn around its plunging smartphone market
share in the U.S. since it peaked in 2001.  The phone also advances  Microsoft ’s push into mobile-device
software, where the company trails Apple and Google Inc.’s
Android. Those who buy the Lumia 928 will get a $25 credit for
Windows Phone applications and games, Nokia said.  Nokia shares  rose  as much as 3.8 percent and gained 3.2
percent to 2.80 euros at 5:51 p.m. in Helsinki trading, paring
this year’s loss to 4.2 percent. Microsoft fell 0.3 percent to
$32.56 at 10:51 a.m. in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
