--  Japan ’s government bonds fell,
pushing 10-year yields to the highest in almost three months,
after a slide in the yen past 101 per dollar and a surge in
equities damped demand for the relative safety of debt.  Benchmark yields climbed as much as 11 basis points, the
biggest intraday surge since April 5, after the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. shares touched a record and Treasury
rates reached a five-week high. U.S. bonds slid after a Federal
Reserve Bank president said he would favor reducing the Fed’s
bond purchases next month. The Tokyo Stock Exchange temporarily
halted bond futures trading after prices tumbled.  “Japan’s bonds are being sold amid gains in Treasury
yields in addition to yen weakness and higher stocks,” said
Daisuke Uno, the Tokyo-based chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp., a unit of Japan’s second-largest bank by market
value. “A selling catalyst is speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will reduce asset purchases.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose 10 basis
points to 0.69 percent at 2:52 p.m. in Tokyo, after climbing to
as high as 0.7 percent, the most since Feb. 25, according to
Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. Thirty-year rates gained 5 1/2 basis points to 1.715
percent, while 20-year yields increased six basis points to 1.57
percent. Five-year rates added 5 1/2 basis points to 0.28
percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Ten-year bond futures for June delivery slid 0.95 to 143.77
earlier slumping to 143.43, the least since April 11. Trading
was halted for about 10 minutes after the  Tokyo  Stock Exchange
issued a circuit breaker due to price fluctuations.  International Sellers  The yen dropped 0.4 percent to 101 per dollar after earlier
touching 101.2, the weakest since April 6, 2009. The Topix Index
of Japanese shares added 2.4 percent, set for the highest close
since September 2008.  Overseas investors cut their holdings of JGBs by 3.94
trillion yen ($39 billion) in March, the most in three years,
according to a report today from the Ministry of Finance.  Separate ministry data showed Japanese money managers
acquired a net 514.3 billion yen of overseas bonds and notes in
the two weeks ended May 3. They had cut holdings of these
securities in the six weeks through April 19, the longest run of
net sales since January 2010.  Japanese debt has lost 4.7 percent in dollar terms since
the  Bank of Japan  announced an expansion of monetary stimulus on
April 4, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.  In the U.S., Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President
 Charles Plosser  said unemployment will probably fall to 7
percent at the end of 2013 and he would favor reducing the Fed’s
$85 billion monthly pace of bond purchases next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
