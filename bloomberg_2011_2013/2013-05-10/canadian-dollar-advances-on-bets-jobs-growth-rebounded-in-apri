The Canadian dollar rose against the
majority of its most-traded peer before a report forecast to
show  job creation  rebounded in April.  The currency touched its lowest level in a week versus the
U.S. dollar as the greenback rose against all its major peers
after the yen fell past 100 to the American dollar yesterday for
the first time since 2009. Canada added 15,000 jobs in April
after losing 54,500 the previous month, according to a Bloomberg
survey of 27 economists. A separate survey predicted the
 unemployment rate  to remain at 7.2 percent.  “I don’t expect the Canadian dollar to lose a lot more
ground from here and it may be the market is seeing these levels
as an opportunity to buy,” said Jane Foley, senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International, by phone from  London .
“Given that we’ve had this selloff, you could say the market is
now positioned for a disappointing number and if we get anything
slightly above the market median then we can see the Canadian
dollar gaining back some ground.”  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell 0.1 percent to
C$1.0076 per  U.S. dollar  at 7:40 a.m. in Toronto, after touching
C$1.0100 per U.S. dollar, its lowest since May 3. One loonie
buys 99.24 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
