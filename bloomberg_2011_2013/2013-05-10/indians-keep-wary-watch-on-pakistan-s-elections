How difficult can it be to entrench the institutions and procedures of democracy in a nation-state established with the specific intention of becoming one? Both democratic fundamentalists and political realists should look at the example of Pakistan, which  goes to the polls  this weekend.  Pakistan traces its birth as a nation-state  to 1947 , when it was formed out of the old landmass of colonial India and the desire of a sizeable section of the subcontinent's Muslims to have a state of their own. But, remarkably,  the elections this weekend  will mark the first occasion in the country's history that a democratically elected civilian government has seen out its entire five-year term and set up a transition to the next one.  Almost from the beginning, the country has been held to ransom by  an excessively powerful military . The army has persistently exploited the fragility of Pakistan's nascent democratic institutions, the tensions of postcolonial politics (primarily the adversarial relationship with India, as well as battles over  the state of Kashmir  and over what was formerly East Pakistan and is now Bangladesh), and the stresses and opportunities of Pakistan's geopolitical situation as a neighbor of Afghanistan and, since the nineties, as  a nuclear state .  Pakistan has been under military rule for more than  half of its history , most notably under General Zia-ul-Haq from 1978 to 1988 and most recently under General Pervez Musharraf from 2001 to 2008. It's fashionable, therefore, among Indians who like their foreign-policy tittle-tattle to think of India "a state with an army" and Pakistan by contrast as "an army with a state."  For more than six decades, Indians have viewed the political and economic discontents of Pakistanis with the mixture of sympathy and schadenfreude that inevitably arise when a centuries-old civilization breaks up into two somewhat arbitrarily formed nation-states. Further, the two countries were racked at their origins by the massive two-way migration of peoples and the enormous bloodbath that was  Partition . The relationship between the two countries was summed up acutely by the Indian sociologist Ashis Nandy in a book-length interview in 2006 when he said: As Pakistan goes to the polls, Indian newspapers have been flush with analysis and  predictions . And a clear indicator of how much is at stake in the elections of 2013 is the violence unleashed in recent weeks by forces within Pakistan that stand to gain most from the destabilization of democracy. The election campaign is already  the bloodiest in Pakistan's history , with more than 100 people killed in violence sponsored mainly by the Pakistani Taliban and the Balochi separatist movement and directed mainly at candidates from the ruling  Pakistan People's Party  and the liberal Muttahida Quami Movement.  The PPP came to power in 2008 on a massive sympathy wave after the assassination of its leader, the former Prime Minister  Benazir Bhutto . This time around, after  an unconvincing five years in power , its chances appear bleak. The momentum appears to be with its main rival,  the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz , headed by  Nawaz Sharif , himself a two-time prime minister, and seen as much more sympathetic to the powerful religious right than the recent regime.  Sharif was  the victim of a coup by Musharraf in 1999 . He was banished to six years in political exile in Saudi Arabia before returning to Pakistan in 2007. Sharif's adventures in Pakistani politics have made him both bitter and wise. In a recent piece titled  "Nawaz Sharif On The Cusp of Power,"  the journalist Mira Sethi shows how Sharif cleverly combines religious rhetoric with an agenda for economic development, and also displays a new maturity about the precedence of democratic institutions over personal rivalries: Sharif appears to most fear the challenge not from the PPP, but rather the  Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf , a party led by a relative political neophyte,  the charismatic former cricketer Imran Khan . He is an outsider who claims he will clean up the system if voted to power. He also has cleverly exploited anti-American sentiment in Pakistan, thereby earning himself some relief from political violence. He has a vast following among Pakistani youth, which is useful in an electorate where about 40  million  will be eligible to vote for the first time at these elections.  Earlier this week,  Khan was badly injured  when he fell from the stage during a political rally, leaving him unable to vote but possibly more attractive to the undecided voter. At the very least, he may turn out to a decisive political spoiler, one that any future government will have to broker a deal with. It's Imran that Sharif seemed to be pointing to when he  warned this week  of the dangers of a fractured mandate and a coalition government.  Whatever the outcome, a second straight run for democracy in Pakistan can only be good for the country -- and indeed for India-Pakistan relations. If there's a more ambitious aspiration, though, that liberals in both India and Pakistan hold in common, it's a shift over the longer term  in the orientation of the Pakistani state away from an official religion .  Pakistan's current constitution,  in the words of  one of its most committed human-rights activists, "brazenly discriminates" against religious minorities, mostly  Hindus , Christians and members of the reviled  Ahmadiyya community , who between them number about 4 to 6 million. The president and prime minister are  constitutionally required to be Muslim . Further,  Article 227  of the constitution declares that "All existing laws shall be brought in conformity with the Injunctions of Islam as laid down in the Holy Quran," making it harder for liberals and democrats to emphasize citizenship over faith, and easier for militants and autocrats to legitimately promulgate an Islamist mindset.  In the short term, then, it would be great to see Pakistan make the transition to a stable democracy. In the long term, it would be even better -- and more worthy of the complex history of the Indian subcontinent -- to see it become  the secular state originally imagined by its founder , Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
