Billionaire Chairman Anil Ambani’s
 Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM)  reported fourth-quarter profit that
beat analysts’ estimates as revenue from use of its network
increased.  Net income fell to 3.03 billion rupees ($55 million) in the
three months through March from 3.32 billion rupees a year
earlier, the Mumbai-based company said in a statement yesterday.
Profit exceeded the 1.27 billion rupees median of 14 analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  India ’s third-largest mobile-phone company by market value
added 1.6 million subscribers in February, the most since June
2011. The carrier signed a 12 billion-rupee deal last month with
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., a unit of  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) 
controlled by Anil’s older brother Mukesh, providing Reliance
Communications additional income. The two companies said more
partnerships would follow.  “The rise in customers came at a time when Reliance
desperately needed the new income,” Harit Shah, a Mumbai-based
analyst at Nirmal Bang Equities Ltd., said before the earnings
announcement. “This should provide some stability for the
future which Reliance hasn’t enjoyed in a long time.”  The company has 7.2 million customers for its third-generation mobile data services, the most among Indian
operators, it said. Call time on the wireless voice network
increased to 105.4 billion minutes, a 2.3 percent gain from the
previous quarter.  The company said separately that it repaid $500 million it
borrowed in 2007.  Revenue in the quarter increased to 51.3 billion rupees
from 50.1 billion rupees a year earlier. Finance costs increased
to 7.47 billion rupees from 5.79 billion rupees.  Shares of Reliance Communications rose 0.5 percent to
110.30 rupees at the close in  Mumbai  yesterday, before the
earnings announcement. They have gained 49 percent this year,
compared with the 3.4 percent increase in the benchmark S&P BSE
India Sensex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
