U.S. soybean inventories may
more than double before the next year’s harvest as
production rebounds from three consecutive years of
drought, the government said.  Reserves  on Aug. 31, 2014, will total 265 million
bushels (7.22 million metric tons), up from this year’s
projection of 125 million, the smallest since 2004, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture said today in a  report . The
average estimate of 31 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
239 million bushels. The USDA said in February that
reserves may total 250 million bushels.  “The USDA is predicting a move from historically
tight supplies to adequate, or potentially surplus supplies
next year,”  Anne Frick , a senior oilseed analyst for
Jefferies Bache LLC in New York, said before the report.
“Weather will now be the focus to see if the U.S. can
produce a big recovery in production.”  Tight supplies of soybeans this year have raised feed
costs for meat producers including Tyson Foods Inc. and
Smithfield Foods Inc. The U.S. may need to import the
commodity and animal feed made from the oilseed from Brazil
and Argentina to bridge the gap until U.S. farmers begin
harvesting in September, Frick said.  Soybean Prices  Soybean futures for July delivery rose 1.3 percent to
close at $14.0875 a bushel yesterday on the Chicago Board
of Trade, capping a three-day gain of 2.9 percent. Still,
the price has dropped 21 percent since reaching a record
$17.89 in September on forecasts for record production in
Brazil and Argentina, the biggest producers after the U.S.  This year’s U.S. soybean crop is projected at a record
3.39 billion bushels, down from 3.405 billion forecast in
February and up from 3.015 billion harvested a year
earlier. Yields may rise to 44.5 bushels an acre from an
estimated 39.6 bushels last year, the USDA said.  Global  inventories  before the start of the 2014
northern hemisphere harvest will be 74.96 million tons, up
from 62.46 million estimated this year. Analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg expected 67.9 million tons, on average.  Soybeans are the second-biggest U.S. crop, valued last
year at $43.2 billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
