Cotton output in U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter, may tumble 19 percent this year
as farmers shift acreage to grains and dry conditions
persist in parts of the South, the Department of
Agriculture said. The decline exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Production may slide to 14 million bales from 17.32
million in 2012, the agency said today in its first
forecast for this year’s output. On average, analysts and
traders expected a drop to 15.34 million bales, a Bloomberg
survey showed.  The USDA estimates that planted acreage would drop 19
percent this year to 10.03 million from 12.31 million after
cotton futures slumped 18 percent in 2012, while corn and
soybeans climbed. The harvested area may decline to 8.4
million acres from 9.37 million, the agency said. Through
yesterday, the fiber dropped 60 percent from an all-time
high of $2.197 a pound on March 7, 2011, as global output
rose and demand waned.  The reduction “will be based on a little bit of
both,” a swing to grains and dry soil, Jordan Lea, the
chairman or Eastern Trading Corp., an exporter in
Greenville, South Carolina, said in an e-mail. “There are
acres that this year will not get planted in Texas without
significant rain in the next 30 days.”  From Jan. 1 to May 7, rainfall across most of West
Texas, the top growing region, was 30 percent to 80 percent
of 30-year averages, according to MDA Information Systems
Inc. in Gaithersburg, Maryland. As of May 5, 17 percent of
the U.S. crop was planted, compared with 35 percent a year
earlier, the government said this week.  The abandonment rate, or unharvested crops, in the
Southwest “is projected at 25 percent due to continued
drought conditions,” the agency said.  The U.S. may ship 11.5 million bales in the 12 months
that start Aug. 1, down 13 percent from 13.25 million in
the current season, the USDA said today in a report. Unsold
supplies will be 3 million bales, equal to 20 percent of
total use, and down 25 percent from 4 million this year.
Yields may fall to 800 pounds per acre from 887 pounds.  World output will be 117.82 million bales, down 2.6
percent from 120.95 million, the agency said. Consumption
will be 110.43 million bales, up 2.1 percent from 108.15
million. Stockpiles may be 92.74 million bales, up 9.4
percent from 84.78 million, with China accounting for most
of the increase.  Inventory in China, the biggest consumer, will climb
21 percent to 58.18 million bales next year from 48.26
million this year, the USDA said. The nation’s stockpiles
will represent 63 percent of the world’s total, according
to the report. Chinese imports will drop 34 percent, to 12
million bales from 18.25 million in the current year.  A bale weighs 480 pounds, or 218 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
