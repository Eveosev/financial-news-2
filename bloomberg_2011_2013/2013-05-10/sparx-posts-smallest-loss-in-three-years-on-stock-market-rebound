Sparx Group Co. (8739) , a Japanese asset-management company, posted its smallest full-year loss in three
years as a recovery in the stock market helped boost assets.  Net loss was 2.2 billion yen ($22 million) in the 12 months
ended March 31, compared with a 4.5 billion yen loss a year
earlier, the Tokyo-based company said in a stock-exchange
statement. Revenue dropped 16 percent to 3.8 billion yen.  Sparx narrowed losses after introducing new funds,
including one that invests in building hotels in areas
devastated by the March 2011 earthquake, and entering the
renewable business.  While total assets increased 25 percent to 669.3 billion
yen in the period, losses on securities holdings weighed on
earnings, it said. Asset-management fees fell 19 percent to 3.15
billion yen, while performance-based fees slid to 40 million
yen, the company said.  Shares of Sparx added 0.2 percent to 33,500 yen at the
close of trading on the Jasdaq exchange in  Tokyo  before the
earnings announcement. The stock has almost quadrupled this
year, compared with the 80 percent gain by the Jasdaq index.  Sparx said it will change its minimum trading unit to 100
shares with a 100-for-1 stock split effective Oct. 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
