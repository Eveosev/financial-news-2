U.K. government bonds fell, pushing
10-year yields to the highest level in seven weeks, as signs the
world economy is improving damped demand for safer assets.  Benchmark gilts headed for their biggest weekly loss in two
months after the Bank of England yesterday refrained from
boosting asset purchases and an industry report showed economic
growth accelerated last quarter. U.K. government securities
dropped along with U.S. Treasuries and German bunds as German
exports rose and Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President
 Charles Plosser  said the U.S. job market is improving. The pound
weakened for a second day against the dollar.  “It’s a day when sentiment seems a little better,” said
 Sam Hill , a fixed-income strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in
London. “Given that so much data across the board has been
disappointing versus consensus, it’s more likely that weaker
expectations are embedded in consensus estimates, so it’s going
to be less difficult to beat those and that does imply a
tactically negative bias for core bond markets.”  The 10-year gilt yield climbed 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 1.90 percent at 4:45 p.m. London time, the
highest level since March 21. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in
September 2022 fell 0.945, or 9.45 pounds per 1,000-pound
($1,532) face amount, to 98.765. The yield has climbed 17 basis
points this week, the most since the period ended March 8.  Growth Quickens  U.K.  gross domestic product  expanded 0.8 percent in the
quarter through April, compared with a growth of 0.3 percent in
the three months ended March 31, the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research said in an estimate released
yesterday. The Bank of England left its stimulus program at 375
billion pounds as officials assessed recent signs of strength in
the economy.  German exports advanced 0.5 percent in March from February,
when they dropped 1.2 percent, the Federal Statistics Office
said in Wiesbaden. The Philadelphia Fed’s Plosser said U.S.
unemployment will probably fall to 7 percent at year-end and he
would favor reducing the Fed’s monthly bond purchases next
month, speaking yesterday in New York.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 0.9 percent this month
through yesterday, trimming gains this year to 0.8 percent,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  German  10-year bund yields  rose 12 basis points today 1.39
percent and the rate on  similar-maturity  Treasuries climbed 10
basis points to 1.91 percent.  Pound Weakens  The pound weakened 0.8 percent to $1.5327 after declining
0.6 percent yesterday. The U.K. currency was little changed at
84.52 pence per euro.  Investors should bet the pound will weaken below $1.50,
according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. The Edinburgh-based bank recommended a target of $1.48 and suggested exiting
the trade if sterling closes above $1.58,  Paul Robson , senior
currency strategist at RBS, wrote in an e-mailed note.  Sterling has weakened 2.6 percent this year, the second-worst performer after the yen among 10 developed-market
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar rose 4 percent and the euro gained 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
