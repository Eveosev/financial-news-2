Inpex Corp. (1605)  said it has reduced the
risk of cost overruns at its $34 billion Ichthys liquefied
natural gas project in  Australia  after  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) 
shelved a similar plan citing ballooning expenses.  Japan’s biggest energy explorer has signed lump sum
contracts accounting for about 75 percent of the project to lock
in costs, Masahiro Murayama, Inpex’s managing executive officer,
told reporters in Tokyo today. It will also manufacture more
equipment outside of Australia to reduce labor costs for the
plant in the country’s north, he said.  Woodside, Australia’s second-biggest oil producer, canceled
its plan to build an onshore LNG facility because of costs and
is considering a floating LNG plant for its Browse natural  gas
field  off the coast of northern Australia. Floating LNG may be
almost 20 percent cheaper than building the Browse project on
land, Deutsche Bank AG said last month. An onshore plant would
have cost about $45 billion, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in an
April 12 report.  The Ichthys onshore plant, which will be capable of
producing 8.4 million tons of LNG a year, is proceeding as
scheduled, Murayama said. The plant is scheduled to start
production by December 2016, according to the company.  “Cost overruns and delays are always a possible risk with
such a large project,” said Murayama. “I don’t think our
project will be affected by the problem that Woodside had”
after taking the risk-reduction measures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
