Canadian  employment  rose in line with
economist forecasts in April as manufacturers added the most
jobs in 11 months, adding to evidence of a modest expansion.  Employment rose by 12,500 and the  jobless rate  was
unchanged at 7.2 percent, Statistics  Canada  said today in
Ottawa. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 15,000
job gain and 7.2 percent unemployment, according to median
forecasts.  Canada is recovering from a slump in exports and investment
late last year, with the April gain following March’s employment
drop of 54,500. Still, the labor market is forecast to stall
this year with unemployment averaging 7.1 percent in the fourth
quarter, according to a separate Bloomberg economist survey.  “The increase in April suggests the economy still has very
little momentum,”  Sal Guatieri , senior economist at BMO Capital
Markets, said by telephone from Toronto. He cited the 13,200 net
jobs lost this year and the April decline in private sector
employment.  Private companies cut 20,000 workers and public-sector
employment rose by 34,200 in April, Statistics Canada said.
Full-time employment increased by 36,000 while part-time
positions dropped by 23,600.  The Canadian dollar fell 0.7 percent to C$1.0133 per U.S.
dollar at 10:13 a.m. in Toronto. It touched C$1.0014 yesterday,
its strongest level since Feb. 15. Benchmark two-year government
bond yields rose 2 basis points to 0.98 percent.  Manufacturing Gains  Manufacturing rose by 20,600 positions in April, the
biggest monthly gain since May last year, according to
Statistics Canada. Factory employment remains lower than a year
ago by 51,800 jobs, a drop of 2.9 percent.  Old Dutch Foods Ltd. said May 7 it will close a  Montreal 
snack-food factory and warehouse that employed 216 people in
September because it wasn’t feasible to renovate the buildings
constructed in 1964.  “Canada is going to continue to have sluggish growth” in
the next two years, said Dean Connor, chief executive officer of
 Sun Life Financial Inc. (SLF) , in a phone interview May 9 from
Toronto. “It’s driven off of demand for commodities and a
slowdown in expansion of credit in the housing sector.”  Housing Drags  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney cut his 2013 growth
forecast last month to 1.5 percent from 2 percent, citing drags
from housing investment, exports and slower government spending.
Other reports this month have shown Canada’s first trade  surplus 
in a year and a  decline  in housing starts.  Government hiring was a strong part of today’s report, with
public administration increasing by 13,200 positions in April.
Workers designated by Statistics Canada as employees rose by
14,200 while self-employment decreased by 1,700.  Average hourly  wages  of permanent employees rose 2.8
percent in April from a year earlier, exceeding the prior
reading of 2.1 percent.  McDonald’s Corp., the world’s biggest restaurant chain,
said on April 11 it planned to hire more than 6,000 people in
Canada as part of an annual one-day hiring event.  Today’s employment figure “is still a bit of a
disappointing result, given than only such a small fraction of
the harsh dip of March was recovered,” said  Jimmy Jean , a
strategist in the fixed-income group at Desjardins Capital
Markets in Montreal.  To contact the reporters on this story:
