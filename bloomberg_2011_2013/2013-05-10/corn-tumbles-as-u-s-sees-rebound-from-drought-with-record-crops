Corn futures tumbled, capping the
biggest weekly loss in more than a month, after the government
said U.S. inventories will double as farms recover from the
drought in 2012 to produce the biggest crop ever.  The harvest this year will surge 31 percent from 2012 to
14.14 billion bushels (359.2 million metric tons), the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report . The average
estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 14.12 billion.
Reserves on Aug. 31, 2014, will more than double from a year
earlier to 2.004 billion bushels, the USDA said. Analysts in a
Bloomberg survey expected 2.038 billion.  While planting is off to the slowest start since 1984 after
rain and snow left muddy fields across the Midwest, farmers
intended to sow the most acres since 1936. Corn futures have
tumbled 25 percent from a record $8.49 a bushel in August,
joining wheat and soybeans last month in a  bear market  that is
reducing costs for buyers including hog-processor  Smithfield
Foods Inc. (SFD)  and ethanol makers such as  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM)   “We have the potential to build a substantial buffer of
corn supplies this year,”  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa , said before the
report. “The weather patterns remain volatile, and that means
there is plenty of time for the crop to get bigger or smaller,
depending on weather the rest of the growing season.”  Corn futures for July delivery slumped 1.9 percent to close
at $6.3625 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The grain declined 3.8 percent for the week, the biggest loss
since April 5. Futures reached a 10-month low of $6.10 on April
24.  Lower Prices  The expected jump in supplies will send prices lower,
according to the government. Cash corn will average $4.70 a
bushel in the year that starts Sept. 1, down from an estimated
record $6.90 a year earlier. In 2011, the grain averaged $6.22.  Average yields this year may rise to 158 bushels an acre, a
record, from 123.4 bushels in 2012, boosting output from an
estimated 10.78 billion bushels last year, the USDA said. The
government in February projected a crop of 14.53 billion, based
on 96.5 million planted acres and an average yield of 163.6
bushels. The department lowered its estimate because of slow
planting caused by cold, wet weather in the main U.S. growing
regions, it said.  In each of the past three years, USDA forecasts for record
crops proved wrong because of drought or heat, including a 13
percent decline in 2012 that was the largest slump in almost two
decades. As of May 5, the government estimated 12 percent of the
crop was in the ground, less than the 56 percent average of the
prior five years.  World Supply  Global corn production was forecast at a record 965.94
million metric tons, a 13 percent jump from the previous year,
according to the USDA. Aggregated world  inventories  on Oct. 1,
2014, will total 154.63 million tons, up from 125.43 million
forecast for the end of this marketing year, the USDA said.
Reserves were projected to jump to 150.9 million tons, according
to the average of 13 analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, with a 2012 value of $77.4
billion, government figures show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
