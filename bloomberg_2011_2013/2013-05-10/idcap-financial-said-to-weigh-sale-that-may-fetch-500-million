MidCap Financial LLC, the Bethesda,
 Maryland  based lender to health-care companies, is exploring a
sale that may fetch about $500 million, said people familiar
with the matter.  MidCap is working with  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  on soliciting
offers, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the process is private. The $500 million figure doesn’t include
an additional payment due to management upon the sale of the
company, said one of the people.  Chief Executive Officer Howard Widra, a former health-care
finance executive at Merrill Lynch & Co., co-founded MidCap in
2008 with money from Thomas H. Lee’s Lee Equity Partners LLC,
Genstar Capital LLC and Moelis & Co. The firms committed about
$500 million to MidCap in 2008, according to a statement at the
time. They have invested about half of that amount so far, said
one of the people.  Chris Tofalli, a spokesman for MidCap and Genstar with
Chris Tofalli Public Relations LLC, declined to comment.
Representatives at Lee and Moelis didn’t immediately return
calls seeking comment. John Yiannacopoulos, a spokesman for Bank
of America, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.  MidCap, which also has offices in  Chicago  and  Los Angeles ,
makes loans of $5 million to $200 million to pharmaceutical
firms, medical device makers, nursing homes and other health-care-related companies, its  website  shows. The firm made almost
$1 billion in credit commitments to health-care companies last
year, according to a January statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
