Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.
lender that makes most of its profit in emerging markets, has
applied for a banking license in Angola and may do the same in
Mozambique as it seeks to increase revenue from Africa.  “We’re applying for a license in Angola -- hopefully,
we’ll have it by the end of the year,” Diana Layfield, chief
executive officer of the lender in Africa, said in an interview
at the World Economic Forum in Cape Town today. “Initially,
we’ll focus on corporate and commercial banking. We’re having
talks with Mozambique authorities next week. We’re very likely
to apply for a bank license there.”  Standard Chartered  already has a representative office in
 Angola  and has set up a joint venture with a state-owned
insurance company. The London-based lender, with operations in
16 African countries, plans to invest $100 million in the
continent over the next three years, opening 110 branches and
recruiting 950 consumer-banking employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
