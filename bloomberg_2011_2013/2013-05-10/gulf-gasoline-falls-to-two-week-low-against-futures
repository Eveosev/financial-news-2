U.S.  Gulf Coast  gasoline fell to a
two-week low against  New York  futures as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) 
said it was returning process units to service at a Texas plant.  A sulfur recovery unit tripped offline at Valero’s 145,000-barrel-a-day Houston refinery because of severe weather early
today, said  Bill Day , a company spokesman in  San Antonio . The
plant was flaring at about 9 a.m. local time as process units
were being returned to service.  “There was no material impact to protection,” Day said in
an e-mail responding to questions.  Conventional, 85-octane gasoline, or CBOB, on the Gulf
Coast retreated 0.25 cent to a discount of 18.5 cents a gallon
to futures on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:16 p.m.
That’s the sixth consecutive decline and the  lowest level  since
April 23, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel was unchanged at  3.25 cents  a gallon below
futures.  Stockpiles of gasoline on the U.S. Gulf Coast, known as
PADD 3, gained  919,000 barrels  to 72.6 million barrels in the
week ended May 3, the first increase in five weeks, according to
U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Inventories of
distillate fuel rose 81,000 barrels to  36.3 million .  The 3-2-1 crack spread on the Gulf Coast, a rough measure
of refining margins based on West Texas Intermediate in Cushing,
 Oklahoma , jumped  47 cents  to $22.16 a barrel. The same spread
for Light Louisiana Sweet oil rose 32 cents to $12.76 a barrel,
a fifth consecutive gain.  The crack spread in New York, measured using Brent oil in
 Europe , tumbled $1.58 to $16.29 a barrel. Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or RBOB, in the New York Harbor strengthened
0.2 cent to 0.1 cent below futures.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  in New York was unchanged at a
premium of 1.13 cents a gallon above futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
