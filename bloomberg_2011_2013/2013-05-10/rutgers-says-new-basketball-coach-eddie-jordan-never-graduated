Rutgers University  says it was wrong
to describe new men’s basketball coach Eddie Jordan as a
graduate of the school, adding in a statement that “neither
Rutgers nor the NCAA requires a head coach to hold a
baccalaureate degree.”  Jordan, 58, who was hired April 23 to replace the fired
Mike Rice, was listed on the athletic department’s website as
having completed a degree in health and physical education in
1977.  Jordan played point guard for the Scarlet Knights from
1973-77 and was on the team the last time the school reached the  Final Four in 1976. He is the school’s career leader in assists
(585) and steals (220).  Deadspin.com reported that Jordan has earned 103 credits
from Rutgers, while the normal threshold for a degree is 110
credits.  “His athletic skills and leadership and his professional
accomplishments have been a source of pride for Rutgers for more
than three decades,” the school said in its statement today on
the athletic department website. “We are excited to have him as
our men’s basketball coach, and we look forward to many winning
seasons.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
