ESPN Radio broadcaster Jack Ramsey
will step away from National Basketball Association playoff
coverage due to an undisclosed health issue.  Ramsey, 88, who was scheduled to work tonight’s second-round game between the Miami Heat and Chicago Bulls, will be
replaced by  Chris Mullin  on the broadcast,  Mike Soltys , a
spokesman for the  Walt Disney Co . network, said in an e-mail. A
decision as to who will replace Ramsey for the remainder of the
postseason hasn’t been announced.  “I need some medical treatments at this time and will be
unable to work the rest of NBA postseason on ESPN Radio,”
Ramsey said in a statement. “I’ll miss doing the broadcasts but
I’ll be watching and listening.”  Ramsey, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1999 and
also was treated for melanoma several years ago, said he needs
to begin immediate treatment and his broadcasting career
probably is over, according to the  Miami Herald .  Ramsey coached in the NBA from 1968-89, posting a 864-783
record and winning an NBA title with the Portland Trail Blazers
in 1977. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in
1992.  To contact the reporter on this story:
