CNN President  Jeff Zucker , who
unveiled a new morning show today in a bid to revitalize the
business, said it may take three years or more before the news
network challenges  Fox News .  “Fox is No. 1, and they’re incredibly strong,” Zucker,
who took the helm at CNN in January, said at an event in New
York. “It’s going to take a long time.”  Zucker is using the morning time slot as the linchpin of
his turnaround plan for CNN, part of  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  The show
unveiled today, called “New Day,” will be more news-driven
than early shows on broadcast networks, meaning “no cooking,
and no concerts,” he said. The program is emblematic of how he
wants the network to look, Zucker said.  “New Day,” which features former “20/20” anchor  Chris
Cuomo , debuts on June 17 in the 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. time slot. That
puts it in direct competition with more established morning
programs, including ABC’s “Good Morning America” and NBC’s
“Today.” Eventually, “New Day” should account for the most
advertising dollars at CNN, he said.  “This is the biggest opportunity time period for CNN,”
said Zucker, 48.  When asked when CNN would be back on top, Zucker said,
“Ask me again in three years. We have miles and miles to go.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
