One person was killed and 33 were
injured in the port city of Mombasa after two suspected grenade
attacks last night, the Kenya Red Cross Society said.  The first attack occurred in the town of Mtwapa, 13.4
kilometers (8.3 miles) from Mombasa, while the second was near
Tononoka stadium in the port city between 7 pm and 8 pm,
spokesperson Nelly Muluka said in a phone interview today.  At least six people died and 68 were injured on March 10
when hand grenades were thrown from a moving car at people
waiting at a bus station on the outskirts of the capital
Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
