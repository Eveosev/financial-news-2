World No. 1 Yani Tseng and Karin Sjodin share the lead at 9-under 207 going into the final round
of the Kraft Nabisco Championship, the first major tournament on
golf’s LPGA Tour.  Sjodin, 28, who has never won on the LPGA Tour, fired a 4-
under 68 yesterday as strong winds blew at the Dinah Shore
Course at Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage,
 California . Tseng, 23, had a 1-under 71.  “I feel like I’m hitting the ball really well, and I’ve
worked on my short game,” Sjodin told reporters. “Playing in
wind is more about trusting the decision you made, and hit it as
solid as you can. The solid shots don’t move too much at
least.”  Tseng has 15 LPGA victories, including five major wins. She
has won back-to-back tournaments, and three times in five starts
overall this season.  “Actually, the front nine, I played very solid, especially
under this wind,” Tseng said. “I don’t think it was as tough
as I thought, because maybe I was prepared for this. But on the
back nine, I got kind of emotional, maybe thinking too much,
wasn’t trusting as much as I did on the front nine.”  Haeji Kang shot a 72 for a three-round total of 209, two
strokes off the lead.  World No. 2 Na Yeon Choi, Eun-Hee Ji, Hee Kyung Seo, I.K.
Kim and Sun Young Yoo are tied at 6-under 210 after the third
round.  Defending champion Stacy Lewis recorded a 1-under 215 in
the first three rounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
