South Korea, the world’s fifth-
largest oil importer, purchased 8.6 percent less crude oil last
month as unit purchase prices increased.  Crude imports fell to 73.2 million barrels from 80.1
million a year earlier, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said
in an e-mailed statement today. The country’s import bill rose
4.5 percent to $8.87 billion as purchase prices climbed 14
percent to $121.2 a barrel, the ministry said, citing
preliminary figures for last month.  South Korea, which imports almost all of its oil needs,
urged companies and individuals in November to save energy in
winter, including cutting back on heating. Large companies,
which use 30 percent of the nation’s electricity, pledged to cut
consumption by 5 percent a year after the government imposed
rolling blackouts in September for the first time since 2001.  Gas import costs increased 19.5 percent to $3.13 billion in
March, while coal costs gained 1.7 percent to $1.53 billion,
according to the ministry.  South Korea ’s oil-product exports rose 7.6 percent to $4.71
billion and petrochemical exports fell 5.8 percent to $3.7
billion, the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
