Argentina ’s government threatened
legal action against a group of British and American banks over
research reports on companies involved in the Falkland Islands’
oil industry, the  Sunday Telegraph reported .  The Argentine embassy in London sent unsigned letters to as
many as 15 banks, understood to include the  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc , Barclays Capital and  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) , on March 20, according to the Sunday Telegraph.  The letter, which had the crest of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and Worship, warned that writing research notes on
exploration companies involved in the Falklands constituted “a
violation of the applicable domestic and international rules,”
the Sunday Telegraph said, citing a copy seen by the newspaper.  A spokeswoman for Royal Bank of  Scotland  declined to
comment. Barclays didn’t answer phone calls made out of business
hours. Phone messages left with Goldman Sachs and the Argentine
embassy in London were not immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
