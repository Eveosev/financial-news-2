The  Oklahoma City  Thunder led by as
many as 30 points on their way to beating the  Chicago  Bulls
92-78 in a matchup between the top two teams in the  National
Basketball Association .  Russell Westbrook scored 27 points and Kevin Durant had 26
and 10 rebounds for the Thunder, who improved to 40-12 with
their sixth straight win and eighth victory in 10 games. The
Bulls (42-12) are now one game ahead of Oklahoma City for the
NBA’s best record after their seven-game winning streak on the
road came to a halt.  Chicago has 12 games remaining, two less than Oklahoma City
in a regular season that was shortened to 66 games from the
usual 82 by a 54-day delay to the start to the campaign as
owners and players negotiated a new 10-year labor accord.  The Thunder, facing a Bulls team without NBA Most Valuable
Player  Derrick Rose  because of a groin injury, led 49-39 at
halftime and took a stranglehold of the game by outscoring
Chicago 31-12 in the third quarter at Chesapeake Energy Arena in
Oklahoma City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
