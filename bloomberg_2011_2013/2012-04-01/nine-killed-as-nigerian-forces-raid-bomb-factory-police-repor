     April 1 (Bloomberg)-- Nine gunmen were killed in a shootout
on Mar. 31 as Nigerian security forces raided a bomb-making
factory in the north-central state of Kogi, the state’s police
commissioner said, while declining to confirm the site belonged
to a militant Islamic sect responsible for bombings in the
country.  “We cannot say categorically that the owners of this bomb-
making factory are members of Boko Haram, because criminals are
also using the same tactics to try to confuse the public,”
Lawal Tanko, Kogi state Commissioner of Police, said by phone
today from Lokoja, the capital.  Boko Haram claimed responsibility for an Aug. 26 suicide
car-bomb attack on a United Nations building that killed 23
people in the capital, Abuja. It also said it was responsible
for blasts that struck eight government buildings on Jan. 20 in
Kano, northern  Nigeria , killing at least 250, according to
rights group Civil Rights Congress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
