Roche Holding AG (ROG) , a Basel,
Switzerland-based drugmaker, may drop its $6.6 billion bid for
 Illumina Inc. (ILMN) , SonntagsZeitung reported, citing an unidentified
person close to Roche’s board.  San Diego, California-based Illumina, a diagnostics
company, can’t rely on Roche’s continuing participation in
negotiations, the person said, adding that for Roche, Illumina
is a “nice-to-have,” not a “must-have,” the Swiss newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
