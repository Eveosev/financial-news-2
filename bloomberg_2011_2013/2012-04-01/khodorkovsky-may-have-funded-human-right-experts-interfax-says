Russia’s jailed oil tycoon  Mikhail Khodorkovsky  financed some human rights experts, who later said
his second conviction should be overturned,  Interfax  said,
citing Vladimir Markin, spokesman for the country’s
Investigative Committee.  Outgoing President  Dmitry Medvedev  ordered a review of the
verdicts against Khodorkovsky after the presidential human
rights council urged overturning the former Yukos Oil Co.
owner’s second conviction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
