Air India Ltd. (AIND)  won approval from
lenders to restructure 180 billion rupees ($3.5 billion) of debt
in the latest rescue plan for the state-owned carrier, the
Business Standard reported.  Nineteen banks, led by  State Bank  of  India , approved
extending the maturity on 105 billion rupees of debt for as long
as 15 years, with the remaining 75 billion rupees to be repaid
through a government-guaranteed bond issue, the newspaper said.
The plan will require cabinet approval, it said.  Air India was awarded 40 billion rupees in a government
bailout last month as it struggles with fuel and loan costs. The
unprofitable airline, the nation’s  third-largest , has also
helped prolong a price war that has contributed to losses at
listed  Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAIR)  and Jet Airways (India) Ltd.  Calls made out of office hours to the phone of K.
Swaminathan, a spokesman at Air India, weren’t answered and he
didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Air India has been unprofitable since its 2007 merger with
state-owned domestic carrier Indian Airlines Ltd. The Mumbai-
based company piled up losses of about 181 billion rupees in the
three years ended March 31, 2011, then-Aviation Minister Vayalar Ravi told parliament on Nov. 24.  The airline has failed to turn surging demand into profit
as it struggles to combine operations following the merger. It
has 263 employees per aircraft compared to 102 at IndiGo, the
only profitable carrier in India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
