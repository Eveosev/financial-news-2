South Africa’s budget deficit will
probably be 4.5 percent for the 12-month period that ended
yesterday, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  The fiscal gap is narrower than a previous estimate of 4.8
percent of gross domestic product, Gordhan told reporters in
Pretoria today. The government collected 742.7 billion rand
($96.8 billion) of revenue, 4 billion rand more than forecast,
he said.  Government spending  was 968.5 billion rand, 4 billion
rand less than previously estimated, he said.  The “domestic environment is improving,” Gordhan said.
“Given the mild optimism about the prospects ahead of us, we
can see that revenue performance is following some of those
indicators.”  Standard & Poor’s  cut the outlook on the nation’s credit
rating last week to negative as growth in Africa’s largest
economy slows this year, making it harder for the government to
rein in the fiscal deficit. The government unexpectedly lowered
its target for the budget gap this fiscal year as  tax revenue  is
forecast to rise.  Economic growth will slow to 2.7 percent this year from 3.1
percent last year, Gordhan said on Feb. 22. Reserve Bank
Governor  Gill Marcus  revised the bank’s forecast higher to 3
percent on March 29, citing an improved global outlook.  The deficit is projected to be 4.6 percent of GDP in the
year through March 2013, 4 percent in the 12 months through
March 2014 and 3 percent in the year after that, according to
the National Treasury on Feb. 22.  Taxes  Personal income tax earnings rose 10 percent to 251.6
billion rand in the past fiscal year, the  South African Revenue
Service  said in a statement today.  Value-added taxes gained 3.8 percent to 190.5 billion rand,
while  customs duties  rose 29 percent to 34.3 billion rand, the
tax service said.  Corporate tax revenue  rose 14 percent to 153.7 billion
rand, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
