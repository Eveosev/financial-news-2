Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki
invited all political parties to a “national meeting” on April
5 to resolve disputes hindering the country’s rebuilding.  “All matters will be resolved according to the
constitution,” he said at a news conference aired on a state-
sponsored television network.  Violence and political disputes in  Iraq  have increased
since December when the U.S. pulled out its troops from the
country. Iraq is seeking investment and expertise to develop the
world’s fifth-largest crude oil reserves. The Sunni Muslim-
backed al-Iraqiya coalition has boycotted parliament and Cabinet
sessions for weeks to press demands for more power-sharing with
the Shiite Muslim prime minister’s alliance.  Iraqiya, led by former Prime Minister  Ayad Allawi , has
warned that if talks to resolve the disputes fail, it will join
other politicians in efforts to dissolve parliament and hold
early elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
