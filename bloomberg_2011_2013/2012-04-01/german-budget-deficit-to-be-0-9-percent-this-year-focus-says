German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  expects the country’s budget deficit to narrow to 0.9
percent of gross domestic product this year, after 1.0 percent
in 2011,  Focus  magazine said, citing documents sent by his
ministry to the European Commission.  The nation’s total debt will rise to 82.1 percent of GDP
this year, solely because of additional payments for the
European Stability Mechanism, after it declined by 2 percentage
points to 81.1 percent in 2011, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
