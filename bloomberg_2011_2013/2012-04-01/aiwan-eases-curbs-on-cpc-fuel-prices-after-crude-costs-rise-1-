Taiwan’s government eased
restrictions on  CPC Corp. ’s gasoline and diesel prices, allowing
the state-run refiner to pass on higher crude costs, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said on its website today.  The benchmark 95-RON gasoline will rise by NT$3.1 a liter
to NT$35.5 ($1.20), and diesel will climb NT$3.2 to NT$33.1 a
liter, effective tomorrow, the ministry said.  Taiwan joins Asian neighbors including  China  in increasing
fuel prices after an increase in crude costs caused  oil
companies  to post losses on refining operations. Oil climbed on
March 30, capping a second quarterly gain, after reports showed
U.S. consumer sentiment and spending rose and President Barack Obama cleared the way for new sanctions targeting  Iran .  RON, or research octane number, is a measurement of
gasoline quality.  To contact the reporter on this story:
