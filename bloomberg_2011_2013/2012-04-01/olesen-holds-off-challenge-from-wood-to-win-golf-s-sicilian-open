Denmark ’s Thorbjorn Olesen held off
a final-round charge from  England ’s Chris Wood to win the
Sicilian Open for his first success on golf’s European Tour.  The 22-year-old finished on 15-under-par 273 at the Verdura
Golf & Spa Resort, one shot ahead of Wood who had a round of 8-
under today to tie the course record.  Olesen collects a check for 166,660 euros ($222,400) and
becomes the second-youngest European Tour winner so far this
year. He’d previously finished second three times in his
previous  41 Tour events .  Soren Kjeldsen of Denmark and  Belgium ’s Nicolas Colsaerts
were two shots further back, with  Spain ’s Jose Manuel Lara
finishing on 11-under.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
