New York ’s airports and Chicago had
their all-time warmest March while Central Park had its second-
hottest as thousands of weather records were set or tied across
the U.S., according to the National Weather Service.  The average temperature for the month at John F. Kennedy
International Airport was 48.5 degrees Fahrenheit (9.2 Celsius)
topping the previous record of 47.7 set in 1973, the  weather
service  said. At LaGuardia Airport, the new record is 50.8,
exceeding 49.8 in 1945.  The average in Chicago was 53.5 degrees. That topped the
previous mark of 48.6 degrees set in 1910 and matched in 1945,
the weather service said, citing data compiled since 1873.  “To put it in perspective, if it was April, it would still
be in the top 10, as far as warmest. It is mind-boggling,” said
 Tom Kines , a meteorologist for AccuWeather Inc. in  State
College ,  Pennsylvania . “There are many areas across the Upper
Midwest that have had their warmest March ever. That seems to be
where the core of the warmth was.”  In New York’s Central Park, the average temperature was
50.9 degrees, 8.9 degrees above normal although below the record
51.1 degrees in 1945, according to the weather service.  Across the U.S., 7,700 daily high temperatures records were
set or matched in March, according to the  National Climate Data
Center  in Asheville,  North Carolina . The warm weather
contributed to a decline in natural gas prices, as less of the
energy was needed to heat homes and business.  Natural Gas  On March 30,  natural gas  for May delivery declined 2.3
cents to $2.126 million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Feb. 6,
2002. The futures fell 29 percent for the quarter and 19 percent
in March.  U.S. stockpiles were 59 percent above the five-year average
in the week ended March 23, the Energy Department said.
Production rose in January, led by gains in the Marcellus shale
formation in the Northeast, a separate report showed. Demand for
the heating fuel was crimped during the quarter by the mildest
winter since 2000.  Saturday’s high temperature in Omaha,  Nebraska , was 91
degrees, a daily record that eclipsed the mark of 88 set in
1946. It also tied the all-time high for the month, recorded
March 25, 1907, according to the weather service.  The warmer weather poses a risk for farmers, according to a
statement by the Midwest Regional Climate Center.  “Despite the early warmth, climatology tells us that the
possibility for a freeze in April remains high, putting early
emerging crops and plants at risk,” according to the center.  Freeze Concerns  Apple and peach trees have been blooming across the Midwest
and eastern U.S. and are also susceptible to freezing
temperatures, according to the center. The warm nighttime
temperatures have cut the amount of maple syrup production in
 Wisconsin  because less sap is running from the trees.  Apple growers in New York were assessing damage to their
trees after temperatures fell into the 20s last week.  Throughout the middle of March, temperatures were 20 to 30
degrees above normal, according to a statement by the Midwest
Regional Climate Center.  Jet Stream  The warmth was caused mainly by the jet stream, a current
of air across the continent, which was much farther to the north
than normal, according to Mike Halpert, deputy director of the
 U.S. Climate Prediction Center  in  Camp Springs ,  Maryland .  While the location of the jet stream is unusual, it isn’t
outside standard weather deviations, Halpert said. More study
will be needed to determine if the shift in the weather pattern
was because of climate change, he said in an interview March 26.  Warm weather will probably continue through the center of
the country until at least April 10, according to the climate
center’s latest 6- to 10-day outlook, published on March 31.  There is a 60 percent chance that temperatures will rise
above average throughout the Midwest and Mississippi River
Valley, including in  Chicago ,  St. Louis  and New Orleans,
according to the center.  Normal temperatures are based on a 30-year average from
1981 to 2010. The normal temperatures, re-set last year, were
0.5-degree warmer than the previous benchmarks based on the
1971-2000 average, according to the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
