France ’s antitrust authority may
review a potentially anti-competitive mobile-phone service
agreement between  Iliad SA (ILD) ’s Free and  France Telecom SA (FTE) ’s
Orange,  Le Parisien  said, citing unidentified union sources.  CFE-CGC labor union representatives at Bouygues Telecom SA
and  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s SFR yesterday asked the regulator to review an
accord between the two companies, which allows Free to gain
access to additional subscribers through the Orange network, the
newspaper reported.  The agreement isn’t a simple commercial accord but a form
of collusion that creates difficulties for SFR and Bouygues,
union sources told Le Parisien.  To contact the reporter on this story:
