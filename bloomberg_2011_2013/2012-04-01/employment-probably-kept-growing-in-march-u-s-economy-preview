Payrolls in the U.S. probably
increased by more than 200,000 workers in March for a fourth
consecutive month as companies became more optimistic about the
outlook for growth, economists said before a report this week.  Employment rose by 205,000 after climbing by 227,000 in
February, according to the median projection of 54 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. The last time hiring advanced at a
similar pace and period was in late 1999-early 2000. The jobless
rate probably held at a three-year low of 8.3 percent.  The pickup in hiring has boosted consumer confidence to a
four-year high, raising the odds that gains in household
spending, which accounts for 70 percent of the economy, can be
sustained. The improvement in the job market may also help
Americans weather the rising cost of gasoline, which Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said posed a risk to growth.  “The underlying health of the economy is getting better,”
said  Stephen Stanley , chief economist at Pierpont Securities LLC
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We’re getting to a point where some
of the hurdles to getting a healthier expansion are starting to
be removed.”  The Labor Department report is due April 6. Payroll
estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from increases of
175,000 to 255,000. Projections for joblessness ranged from 8.1
percent to 8.4 percent.  Another report may show that expansion in the services
industry, which makes up almost 90 percent of the economy, held
near the fastest pace in a year.  Private Payrolls  Private payrolls, which exclude government agencies, are
forecast to expand by 221,000 after a 233,000 gain in February,
according to the survey median. Factory payrolls are projected
to rise by 21,000 after increasing by 31,000 in February.  Redwood City , California-based  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , the largest
maker of  database software , is among companies looking to expand
their workforce.  “We set a plan in motion to accelerate our hiring,”  Mark Hurd , Oracle’s co-president, said on a March 20 earnings call.
“This is salespeople and the presales people that support them.
We think we have a lot of gas in the tank to drive organic
growth given the hiring we’ve done.”  Other measures of the labor market have also shown
improvement. Dismissals have waned, suggesting companies may be
growing more confident about the economic outlook.  Applications (INJCJC) 
for  unemployment benefits  declined to 359,000 in the week ended
March 24, the fewest since April 2008. They averaged 376,750 in
January and 366,750 in February, according to Labor Department
data.  Bernanke’s View  “A wide range of indicators suggests that the job market
has been improving, which is a welcome development indeed,”
Bernanke said last week in a speech to the National Association
for Business Economics. “Still, conditions remain far from
normal, as shown, for example, by the high level of long-term
unemployment and the fact that jobs and hours worked remain well
below pre-crisis peaks.”  Faster wage gains are needed to help Americans weather
gasoline prices that have increased 65 cents this year through
March 29, to $3.93 a  gallon , according to AAA, the nation’s
largest auto group.  Wages and salaries in February climbed 0.3 percent after a
0.4 percent advance the previous month, according to the
Commerce Department’s revised figures released last week.  Higher stock prices alongside an improving labor market are
helping push up  consumer confidence . The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index has climbed 12 percent so far this year.  Growing Confidence  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort  Index (COMFCOMF)  climbed to a four-year
high in early March and has hovered near there since.  Also this week, the  Institute for Supply Management ’s  gauge 
of non-manufacturing companies eased in March to 56.9 from 57.3
the prior month, which was the highest since February 2011,
according to the median estimate in the Bloomberg survey.
Measures greater than 50 signal growth. Figures from the Tempe,
Arizona-based group are due on April 4.  The same group’s  factory index , scheduled for release
tomorrow, rose to 53 in March from 52.4 the previous month, the
survey median showed.
