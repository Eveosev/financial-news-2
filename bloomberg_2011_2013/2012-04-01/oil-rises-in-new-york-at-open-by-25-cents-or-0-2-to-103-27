Oil advanced for a second day in  New
York  on signs that the economy is improving in  China , the
world’s second-biggest consumer of crude.  Futures rose as much as 0.5 percent after a purchasing
managers’ index climbed to a  one-year high  in March. Oil capped
a 4.2 percent gain in the first quarter as President  Barack
Obama  said March 30 that world supplies are sufficient to
proceed with new sanctions against  Iran .  “The firmer tone relates to the official Chinese PMI
reading, and that reverses the negative sentiment we’ve seen
around China,” said  Michael McCarthy , a chief market strategist
at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty in Sydney. “That speaks well to
demand. The Middle East seems to be quietly boiling away without
any signs at this stage of a blow-up.”  Oil for May delivery gained as much as 56 cents to $103.58
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  and was at $103.12 at 3:05 p.m. Singapore time. Prices
fell 3.8 percent in March, narrowing the first-quarter gain.  Brent oil for May settlement increased 26 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $123.14 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. The European benchmark contract’s  premium  to
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate was at $20, up from
$19.86 on March 30, the most since Oct. 24.  Economic Data  The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 53.1 last month,
China’s logistics federation and the National Bureau of
Statistics said. The gauge has a pattern of rising each March.
In contrast, a PMI from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
showed manufacturing contracting and export orders falling.  Payrolls in the U.S., the world’s biggest crude consumer,
probably increased in March for a fourth consecutive month,
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said before an April 6
report from the Labor Department. Employment rose by 205,000
after climbing by 227,000 in February, the survey shows.  Oil has gained this year on speculation Western sanctions
aimed at halting  Iran’s nuclear program  will disrupt  Middle East 
shipments. Obama cleared the way for sanctions aimed at banks in
countries that import Iranian oil, according to a memorandum
released by the White House last week. The law allows banks that
settle petroleum-related transactions through Iran’s central
bank to be cut off from the U.S. banking system.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators decreased bullish
oil wagers by 6,460, or 2.6 percent, to 241,367 contracts in the
seven days ended March 27, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report on March 30.  OPEC Output  Oil output in March from the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries climbed to the highest level in more than
three years, led by a Libyan production gain, a Bloomberg News
survey showed on March 30.  Production increased 110,000 barrels, or 0.4 percent, to an
average 31.22 million barrels a day in March from a revised
31.11 million in February, according to the survey of  oil
companies , producers and analysts. Output increased to the
highest level since October 2008. The February total was revised
55,000 barrels a day higher. Iranian production fell to the
lowest level in almost 10 years.  South Korea , the world’s fifth-largest oil importer,
purchased 8.6 percent less crude last month. Imports fell to
73.2 million barrels from 80.1 million a year earlier, the
Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
