The Hamas movement approved a budget
of $869 million for government operations in the  Gaza Strip , the
organization said today in an e-mailed statement.  The spending plan includes $174 million from what was
described in the statement as “public revenue.” In the past,
Hamas has received the bulk of its funding from Iran and Arab
countries. It also collects customs fees from gasoline, cars,
cigarettes and other products smuggled into Gaza from Egypt.  Hamas, classified as a terrorist organization by Israel,
the U.S. and the European Union, broke with the Palestinian
Authority in 2007 and has ruled Gaza since. It’s in talks with
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reunite and
form a joint government for both Gaza and the  West Bank .  To contact the reporters on this story:
