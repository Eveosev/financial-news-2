Uruguay  has offered to export rice to
 Iran  in exchange for  crude oil  amid sanctions against the
Persian Gulf country which limit financial transactions,  Fars 
reported, citing Uruguayâ€™s Agriculture Minister Tabare Aguerre.  Iran, one of the largest consumers of Uruguayan rice,
imported about 90,000 tons of the commodity in 2011, the state-
run news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
