The Italian Senate is ready to
approve the reform of the labor market in 30 to 40 days once the
government presents its draft law to legislators, Senate Speaker
Renato Schifani said in a interview with SKY TG 24.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s cabinet passed proposals on
March 23 for an overhaul of the country’s labor market, saying
the changes will help attract investments and bring down a
decade-high  unemployment rate .  The draft law, which includes expanded jobless benefits and
more leeway in firing, has yet to be presented to parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
