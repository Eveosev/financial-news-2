Roche Holding AG (ROG) , a Basel,
Switzerland-based drugmaker, may drop its $6.6 billion bid for
 Illumina Inc. (ILMN) ,  SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing an unidentified
person close to Roche’s board.  Illumina, a  San Diego , California-based diagnostics
company, can’t rely on Roche’s continuing participation in
negotiations, the person said, adding that for Roche, Illumina
is a “nice-to-have,” not a “must-have,” according to the
Swiss newspaper.  Roche won’t raise its bid for Illumina a second time, the
same person told SonntagsZeitung.  The Swiss drugmaker on March 29 raised its offer for
Illumina by 15 percent to $51 a share. Investors have until
April 20 at 6 p.m. New York time to tender their stock.
Illumina’s technology may help Roche, the world’s biggest maker
of cancer drugs, tailor medicines to individual patients.  Daniel Grotzky, a Basel-based spokesman for Roche, declined
to comment on the SonntagsZeitung report when contacted by
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
