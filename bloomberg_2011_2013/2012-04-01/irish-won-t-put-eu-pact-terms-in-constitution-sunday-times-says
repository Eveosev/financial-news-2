Ireland plans to implement the terms
of the European Union fiscal pact via laws on financial
responsibility rather than the nation’s constitution, the  Sunday
Times  said, citing European Affairs Minister Lucinda Creighton.  The move will make it easier to reverse the rules in the
future, the newspaper said. The wording of the referendum on May
31 has been finalized and is “just an enabling clause allowing
the government to bring the treaty into effect,” Creighton
said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
