Papiss Cisse scored two goals for a
second straight game as Newcastle beat Liverpool 2-0 in English
soccer’s Premier League to maintain the club’s push for European
qualification.  Cisse has now scored seven in seven matches since joining
the Magpies in January. Newcastle extends its winning run in the
league to three matches, while Liverpool has three successive
defeats.  Liverpool finished the match with 10 men after goalkeeper
Pepe Reina was red-carded in the 82nd minute.  Newcastle is level on points with fifth-place Chelsea.
Fifth position guarantees a spot in the second-tier Europa
League, while as many as two extra spots could be available
depending on whether the domestic cup winners qualify through
their league positions. Liverpool, the Carling Cup champion, is
11 points back in eighth spot.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
