Vietnam  said it again asked China to
release 21 of its citizens detained while fishing near the
disputed Paracel Islands.  Deputy Prime Minister Hoang Trung Hai met with Chinese Vice
Premier Le Keqiang at the Boao Forum for Asia in the southern
province of Hainan yesterday and asked that the fishermen and
their two vessels be “immediately and unconditionally” freed,
according to a statement on the government website.  Vietnam had requested the crews’ release last month,
according to a government statement on March 21. Neither
statement provides details on when the incident occurred.  The Vietnamese were fishing illegally, Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a March 22 briefing in
Beijing.  Vietnam yesterday demanded  China  halt plans for a sailboat
race to the Paracels, a chain of 30 islets and reefs in the
 South China Sea , according to a statement on the government’s
website. The islands are controlled by China, which ousted
fellow claimant Vietnam in a 1974 battle in which 71 soldiers
were killed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
