Tottenham beat Swansea City 3-1 to
end a five-match winless run in English soccer’s Premier League,
while Papiss Cisse got two goals for a second straight game as
Newcastle defeated Liverpool 2-0.  Emmanuel Adebayor scored twice, while  Rafael van der Vaart 
also got a goal for Spurs, who are level on points with third-
place Arsenal and five points clear of Chelsea and Newcastle in
the next two spots.  Third position secures direct entry into the group stage of
Europe’s Champions League, while the fourth-place team will play
in qualifying. Fifth position guarantees a place in the second-
tier Europa League, while as many as two extra spots could be
available depending on whether the domestic cup winners qualify
through their league positions.   Manchester United  leads the standings on 73 points,
 Manchester City  has 71, with Arsenal and Tottenham 13 points
further back.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
