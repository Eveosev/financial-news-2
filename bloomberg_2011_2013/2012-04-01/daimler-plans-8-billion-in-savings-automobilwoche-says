Daimler AG (DAI) â€™s Mercedes unit plans to
save 6 billion euros ($8 billion) in purchasing and production
costs,  Automobilwoche  said, citing comments by management board
member  Wolfgang Bernhard .  The carmaker sees costs rising by that amount in the coming
years as raw materials become more expensive, technologies to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions are added, and Mercedes cars are
equipped with more expensive extras, the magazine said. The
savings aim to fully offset the additional costs by 2017, the
magazine cited Bernhard as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
