Energiekontor AG (EKT)  forecast 2012
revenue to rise after the German developer of wind parks
returned to profit in 2011.  Pretax profit was 12.4 million euros ($17 million) in 2011
compared with a loss of 2.5 million euros the year earlier, the
Bremen-based company said in a statement today. Sales rose 97
percent to 63.3 million euros, helped by the sale of project
rights to an offshore windpark.  The company said it expects revenue to increase further
this year as it adds wind parks in the U.K. and  Germany  to its
portfolio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
