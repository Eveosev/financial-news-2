Societe Nationale d’Investissement,
an investment fund controlled by Morocco’s King Mohammed VI,
said it nearly doubled its profit in 2011.  Net income increased to 4.3 billion dirhams ($513 million)
from 2.9 billion dirhams in 2010, according to financial
statements published in pro-government daily newspaper Le Matin.
Assets rose 10 percent to 115.2 billion dirhams.  SNI was listed on the Casablanca stock market until August
2010, when it merged with subsidiary Omnium Nord Africain and
bought back its outstanding shares in a $3.9 billion offer.  Tens of thousands of Moroccans have been taking to the
streets nationwide for the past year to protest against the
influence of the king’s investment fund as well as to demand
freer elections, greater civil liberties and less corruption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
