James Murdoch , News Corp.’s deputy
chief operating officer, may step down as chairman of  British
Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) , the  Sunday Telegraph reported ,
citing a person with knowledge of the situation.  Murdoch is considering whether to resign from BSky before
the U.K. Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport select committee
issues a report into the phone-hacking scandal at News Corp.’s
British publishing unit News International, the newspaper
reported. The report is expected at the end of April, according
to the Telegraph.  The chairman’s position at the U.K. pay-TV company may be
filled in the interim by  Nicholas Ferguson , a senior independent
director, should Murdoch resign, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
