Ireland’s government may approve
plans to sell the energy unit of Bord Gais Eireann, the state-
owned gas company, before the country’s bailout partners start
their next Irish review this month, the  Sunday Business Post 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Government ministers may also allow Bord Gais’s networks
unit, which the state plans to retain, to run a to-be-
established Irish Water company that will be responsible for the
nation’s water services, according to the newspaper.  Ireland has committed to introducing water charges by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
