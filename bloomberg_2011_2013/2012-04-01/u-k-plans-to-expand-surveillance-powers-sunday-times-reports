The U.K. government will announce
plans next month to expand its powers to monitor the phone
calls, e-mails and website visits of every Briton, according to
the  Sunday Times , which didn’t say where it got the information.  Internet companies will be told to install equipment to
allow British communications-intelligence agency GCHQ to access
some information on all phone calls,  text messages , e-mails and
website visits in real time, the newspaper reported.  Some details of the proposals, to be announced in May’s
legislative agenda-setting Queen’s Speech, were given to members
of the U.K.’s  Internet Service Providers’ Association  last
month, the Sunday Times said. While the new law won’t allow GCHQ
to monitor the content of communications without a warrant, it
would permit the agency to track timings, duration, frequency
and contact information, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
