AAC Capital Partners Ltd. plans to
wind down its business in the U.K. in the next five years, the
 Independent on Sunday  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  AAC, the former private-equity unit of ABN Amro Holding NV,
abandoned a 300 million-pound ($480 million) fundraising plan,
according to the newspaper. This may signal investors have
turned their backs on the U.K. buyout industry, the Independent
on Sunday said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
