South Africa ’s economy may grow
faster than the 2.7 percent government’s estimate this year,
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said.  “We are cautiously optimistic that our recovery will
continue, our growth will be slightly higher,” Gordhan told
reporters in  Pretoria , the capital, today.  He declined to
provide a specific forecast.  South Africa has a “carefully managed” fiscal trajectory,
Gordhan said, responding to  Standard & Poor’s  move cutting the
credit rating outlook for the nation to negative.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
