Authorities in  Iraq ’s semi-
autonomous Kurdish region halted crude oil exports today due to
a pay dispute with the central government in  Baghdad .  The Iraqi government has failed to pay money owed to oil
producers since May 2011, according to a  statement  from the
Kurdish Ministry of Natural Resources. The ministry has
estimated the amount owed at $1.5 billion.  “There have been no payments for 10 months, nor any
indication from federal authorities that payments are
forthcoming,” it said.  Last week the Kurdistan Regional Government called on
foreign companies including  BP Plc (BP/)  not to make separate
agreements with Iraq’s central government to develop  oil fields 
in and around the disputed northern city of Kirkuk. The central
government has said it is talking with BP about boosting output
at a field called Kirkuk, near the same city.  In February Iraq produced 2.76 million barrels a day of
crude, most of which comes from southern fields, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Kurds last week  cut  their
production from 175,000 barrels a day to 50,000 barrels a day
over the pay dispute.  An earlier disagreement over oil revenues between Iraq’s
government and Kurdish authorities led to a yearlong halt in
exports from the region that ended in February 2011. Iraq holds
the world’s fifth-biggest crude reserves, based on BP statistics
that also include Canadian  oil sands , and it seeks to boost oil
exports to help rebuild an economy recovering after years of
conflict, sanctions and sabotage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
