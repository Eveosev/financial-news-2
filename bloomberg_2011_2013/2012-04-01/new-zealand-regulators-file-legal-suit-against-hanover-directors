The  Financial Markets Authority  of
 New Zealand  said it filed civil proceedings against directors
and promoters of Hanover Finance Ltd., Hanover Capital Ltd. and
United Finance Ltd. relating to statements made in December 2007
prospectuses, subsequent advertising and the March 2008
prospectus extension certificate.  The regulator is seeking declarations, pecuniary penalty
orders and compensation for investors who made investments
during the period Dec. 7, 2007, to July 22, 2008, it said in an
e-mailed statement today.  Hanover was the largest of more than 20 New Zealand non-
bank lenders that failed as the collapse of the U.S. housing
market and losses on subprime mortgages sparked a global credit
squeeze in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
