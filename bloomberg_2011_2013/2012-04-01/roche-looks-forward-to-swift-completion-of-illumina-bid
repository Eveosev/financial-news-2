Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the world’s
largest maker of cancer drugs, looks forward to the “swift
completion” of its takeover offer for  Illumina Inc. (ILMN) , a
spokesman said.  “We look forward to the possibility of a swift completion
of the Illumina transaction that offers immediate value to
Illumina’s shareholders,” Alexander Klauser, a spokesman for
the Basel, Switzerland-based drugmaker, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  He commented after SonntagsZeitung reported that Roche may
drop the hostile bid, which values the San Diego-based gene-
sequencing company at about $6.7 billion. The newspaper cited an
unidentified person close to Roche’s board.  The Swiss drugmaker on March 29 raised its offer for
Illumina by 15 percent to $51 a share. Investors have until
April 20 at 6 p.m. New York time to tender their stock.
Illumina’s technology may help Roche tailor medicines to
individual patients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
