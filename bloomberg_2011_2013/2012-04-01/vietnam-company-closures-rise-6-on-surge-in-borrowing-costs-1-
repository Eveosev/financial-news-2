Company closures in  Vietnam  rose 6
percent from a year earlier in the first quarter due to high
borrowing costs and “limited” access to credit, Vu Duc Dam,
chairman of the Government Office said today.  “Even as banks reduce  interest rates , they remain at a
high level and companies still have difficulties borrowing,”
Dam said at a regular monthly press briefing in Hanoi.  Closures totaled 11,900 during the period, including 2,200
companies that shut permanently and operating halts by the rest,
according to a press release distributed at the briefing.  Gross domestic product  rose 4 percent from a year earlier
in the first quarter, government data released March 29 showed,
the slowest pace since 2009 as bank lending declined and
domestic demand weakened.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam cut its repurchase and
refinancing rates by one percentage point last month, and
ordered the nation’s four largest banks to lower borrowing costs
from as high as 25 percent, seeking to counter a fall of about 2
percent in lending this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
