J.R. Smith came off the bench to
score 20 points and help a  New York Knicks  team playing without
Jeremy Lin and Amar’e Stoudemire defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers
91-75.  Point guard Lin, who has missed the last four games with a
sore knee, and forward Stoudemire, who has a bulging disk in his
lower back, may be out for the rest of the Knicks’ regular
season, which ends April 26.  Carmelo Anthony  had 19 points last night for the Knicks who
played on their home court at Madison Square Garden. The team
had a 46-38 advantage at halftime.  Antawn Jamison had 13 points for the Cavaliers and Alonzo Gee added 12.  The Knicks (27-26) are holding the eighth and final playoff
spot in the Eastern Conference, 15 games behind the  Chicago
Bulls  and 2½ games ahead of the ninth-place Milwaukee Bucks who
lost 99-95 to the Memphis Grizzlies last night. The Cavaliers
(17-33) are 11th, 23½ games off the lead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
