A Palestinian prisoner agreed to end
her 43-day hunger strike and will be deported from  Israel  to the
Hamas-ruled  Gaza Strip , an Israeli official said.  Hana Shalabi, who was arrested at her home in the West Bank
Feb. 16, will be expelled today through a crossing between
Israel and Gaza and cannot return for three years, Prisons
Authority spokeswoman Sivan Weizman said in a phone interview.  Shalabi carried out the hunger strike to protest her being
held by Israel without charges under a legal mechanism called
administrative detention. She was previously arrested in 2009
and held without charges until being freed last October in a
prisoner exchange that freed captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
