Vnesheconombank (VNECB) ,  Russia ’s state-
development bank chaired by  Vladimir Putin , may fund the first
project to develop liquefied natural-gas market domestically,
the government said.  The board of the Moscow-based bank, known as VEB, plans to
discuss tomorrow funding a plant in central Russia’s Tambov
region, which will produce more than 400,000 metric tons of LNG
a year and start supplying it to the domestic market, the
government said in an e-mailed statement.  VEB plans to boost its loans portfolio 7 percent this year
to 540 billion rubles ($18.4 billion). The board will also
discuss tomorrow funding sales of 400 Russian locomotives to
Ukraine, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
