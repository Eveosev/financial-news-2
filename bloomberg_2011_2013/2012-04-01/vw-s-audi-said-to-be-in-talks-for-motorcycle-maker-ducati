Daimler AG, the world’s third-
largest maker of luxury cars, may be interested in buying
 Italy ’s  Ducati Motor Holding SpA (DMH) ,  Il Corriere della Sera 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Ducati is in advanced talks with Audi AG, although the
purchase of the company by the German carmaker is not the only
option on the table, the newspaper said.  Marc Binder , a spokesman for Daimler, said on March 13 that
the company had no interest in purchasing Ducati. “We’re not
interested in a takeover of the company,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
