Johan Santana , who missed last
season after shoulder surgery, will start for the  New York Mets 
on the opening day of the Major League Baseball season against
the  Atlanta Braves .  Left-hander Santana, 33, last started for the Mets on Sept.
2, 2010, also against the Braves. The four-time All-Star had
surgery 12 days later to repair a tear in his throwing arm’s
anterior capsule, close to the pectoral muscle.  “I’m very happy that I have an opportunity to start the
season from day one,” Santana told reporters at the Mets’
spring training camp in Port St. Lucie, Florida. “That’s
something that I was really looking forward to.”  Santana won the Cy Young Award as the best pitcher in the
American League in 2004 and 2006 with the  Minnesota Twins . In
February 2008 he signed a six-year, $137.5 million contract with
the Mets and set a franchise record that year for strikeouts for
left-handers in a single season, with 206.  In three seasons with the Mets prior to the shoulder
surgery, Santana had a 40-25 record and 2.85 earned run average.  The Mets get their season under way with games on April 5,
7 and 8 at Citi Field in New York against Atlanta. Right-hander
Tommy Hanson will start on opening day for the Braves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
