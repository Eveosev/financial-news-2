Six of October Development &
Investment Co. , an Egyptian luxury real-estate developer, headed
for the lowest close in almost two weeks after the government
withdrew one of the company’s land plots.  Shares (OCDI)  of the Cairo-based company dropped 3.9 percent to
15.80 Egyptian pounds at 11:22 a.m. in Cairo, poised for the
lowest close since March 19. The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30) 
retreated 1.1 percent.  The company, also known as Sodic, said a government agency
withdrew a plot of land it had awarded it for the Eastown
project on the outskirts of Cairo. Sodic plans to appeal the
decision with the New Urban Communities Authority’s upper
appeals committee and has filed a petition with the Conflict
Resolution Committee to preserve its rights, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
