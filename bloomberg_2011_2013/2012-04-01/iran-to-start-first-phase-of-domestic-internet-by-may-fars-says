Iran  will introduce the first phase
of its domestic Internet network by May 21, the state-run  Fars 
news agency reported, citing Iranian Minister of Communication
and Information Technology Reza Taghipour.  Taghipour said the launch of the network was a priority of
his ministry in the new Iranian year that started on March 20. A
local  data center , search engine and domestic e-mail service are
being completed, Fars cited him as saying, without elaborating
on the projects.  Iranian officials had earlier announced plans to set up a
national Internet search engine by 2012, which they said will be
more suited to the needs of Iranians as it will produce a
smaller list of results than others such as Yahoo and Google.  To contact the reporter on this story:
