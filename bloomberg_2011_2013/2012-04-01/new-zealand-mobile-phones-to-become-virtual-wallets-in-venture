New Zealand  mobile phone companies
plan to form a joint venture to create an application that will
allow people to use their devices as a “virtual wallet” in
supermarkets and on trains.  Paymark Ltd., which processes three-quarters of New
Zealand’s electronic card payments, will join forces with
Vodafone New Zealand Ltd., 2degrees Ltd., and  Telecom Corp of
New Zealand Ltd . to create a “trusted service manager” that
allows consumers to make secure payments, collect loyalty points
and use public transport with their  mobile phones , Paymark said
in an e-mailed statement.  “Over the past decade, our mobile phone has swallowed our
newspaper, our map and our camera to become an essential all-in-
one device,” Eric Hertz, chief executive officer at Auckland-
based 2degrees, said in the statement. “The logical next step
is to make it even more convenient by having it swallow our
wallet.”  The service, which plans to use near-field communications
technology, will allow customers to make payments by holding an
enabled phone close to a special terminal in stores and on
trains or buses, according to the statement. Software inside the
phone will send transactions over the banking network.  To contact the reporter on this story:
