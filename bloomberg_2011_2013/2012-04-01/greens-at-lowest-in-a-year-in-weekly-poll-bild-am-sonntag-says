Germany â€™s  Green Party  dropped to the
lowest voter support in more than a year,  Bild am Sonntag  said,
citing a weekly poll by Emnid research company.  The Greens dropped two percentage points to 13 percent,
while the Social Democrats had 27 percent, one percentage point
less than in the previous week, meaning their preferred
coalition with the Greens is moving away from a potential
majority, the newspaper said.  The Pirate Party gained two percentage points to 9 percent,
Bild said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
