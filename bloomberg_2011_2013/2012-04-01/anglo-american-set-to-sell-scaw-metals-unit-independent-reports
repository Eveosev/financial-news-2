Anglo American Plc (AAL)  is poised to sell
its Scaw Metals steel assets, the  Independent on Sunday 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Russian steelmaker  Evraz Plc (EVR)  is said to be among companies
that have talked about buying Scaw Metals, according to the
newspaper. Anglo American initially wanted to sell Scaw Metals
for between $800 million and $900 million, although it may now
accept bids between $500 million and $750 million, the newspaper
said.  The sale process for Scaw Metals “is under way,” a
spokesman for Anglo American in London said in an e-mail today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
