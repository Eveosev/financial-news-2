U.K. finance directors are less
pessimistic about the  economic outlook  as optimism about
companies’ finances rose at the fastest rate since at least
2007, according to a quarterly survey by Deloitte LLP.  Thirty percent of 136 chief financial officers at some of
Britain’s biggest companies questioned in the study predict the
economy will fall back into recession, Deloitte said in an e-
mailed statement released in London today. That compares with a
result of 54 percent in a December survey.  The proportion of CFOs expecting one or more countries to
exit the euro-area this year dropped to 26 percent from 37
percent, the business-services company said.  Deloitte carried out the survey, which included finance
directors at 39 members of the FTSE 100 Index and 53 FTSE 250
Index companies, between March 9 and March 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
