Ireland’s government will raise more
than 500 million euros ($667 million) from the auction of high-
speed broadband and fourth-generation cell-phone licences this
year, the  Sunday Times  reported, without citing where it got the
information.  ComReg , the communications regulator in Dublin, has
indicated that the auction process should be completed by the
end of July, according to the Irish edition of the newspaper
today.  Ireland’s four main cell-phone operators,  Vodafone Group
Plc (VOD) , and units of  Telefonica SA (TEF) , Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and
Eircom Group Ltd. and broadband providers, Liberty Global Inc.’s
UPC Ireland, Imagine Communications Group Ltd. and Digiweb Ltd.
may be interested in the licences.  To contact the reporter on this story:
