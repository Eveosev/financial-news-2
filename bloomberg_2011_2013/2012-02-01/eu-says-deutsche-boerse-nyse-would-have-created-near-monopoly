European Union regulators vetoed
 Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1)  and  NYSE Euronext’s (NYX)  plan to create the
world’s biggest exchange because it would have led to a “near-
monopoly” in European exchange-traded derivatives.  Savings from the merger “would not be substantial enough
to outweigh the harm to customers” from removing competition in
several asset classes, regulators said in an e-mailed statement.
The deal would have increased prices for customers and removed
incentives to innovate, they said.  “We tried to find a solution, but the remedies offered
fell far short of resolving the concerns,” said EU Competition
Commissioner  Joaquin Almunia  in the statement. “These markets
are at the heart of the financial system and it is crucial for
the whole European economy that they remain competitive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
