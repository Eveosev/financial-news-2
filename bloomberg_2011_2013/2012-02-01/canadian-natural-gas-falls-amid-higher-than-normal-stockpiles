Canadian natural gas fell amid
speculation that U.S. inventories of the fuel decreased less
than seasonal averages last week.  Alberta  gas dropped 6.1 percent. Stockpiles probably
declined 129 billion cubic feet last week, the median of 17
analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) . The five-year average
decline is 186 billion cubic feet, according to the Energy
Department, which is scheduled to release its weekly survey of
gas in storage at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  “The market is saying you’re going to have to drive prices
low enough to get some demand,” said Kyle Cooper, director of
research at IAF Advisors in Houston.  Alberta gas for March delivery fell 12.75 cents to C$1.96 a
gigajoule ($1.86 per million British thermal units) at 3:50 p.m.
New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas has
dropped 32 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on TransCanada Corp.’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for March delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 12.1 cents, or 4.8 percent, to settle at $2.382
per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago 
dropped 15.34 cents, or 4.8 percent, to $2.4647 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance, an express line, can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day to the Midwest from western
Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas tumbled 10.06 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $2.3454,
according to ICE. At Malin, Oregon, where Canadian gas is traded
for California markets, gas was down 7.9 cents, or 3.1 percent,
to $2.4659.  Prices probably won’t stay at current low levels, Suncor
Energy Inc. President  Steve Williams  said in a conference call
in Calgary today. The fuel will probably return to $5 to $6 per
million Btu, he said, without giving a time estimate.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 187 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.68 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta. The fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line at Empress.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.11 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 705 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.74 billion cubic feet today, or 71 percent of its
capacity of 2.44 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.95
billion cubic feet at 2:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
