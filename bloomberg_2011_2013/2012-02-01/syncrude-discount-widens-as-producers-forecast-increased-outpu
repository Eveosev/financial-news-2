The discount for Syncrude to West
Texas Intermediate oil, the U.S. benchmark, widened after the
two biggest synthetic crude producers forecast output gains.  Syncrude Canada Ltd., a venture that includes Exxon Mobil
Corp., will boost output this year after being hobbled by
production problems in 2011, according to  Canadian Oil Sands (COS) 
Ltd., its largest holder.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , the second-largest
synthetic crude producer after Syncrude, said it may boost
output by 17 percent this year.  “In 2012 we are looking forward to a 7 percent increase in
volumes over 2011,” Marcel Coutu, chief executive officer of
Canadian Oil Sands, said in a statement.  Syncrude (USCSSYNS) ’s discount to West Texas Intermediate widened $2
to $6 a barrel at 4:22 p.m. in  New York , the widest gap since at
least March 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from
the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount to WTI widened 50 cents to
$27.50.  Bakken (USCSUHC1)  oil’s discount was unchanged at $5 below the U.S.
benchmark.  In the U.S. Gulf Coast,  Light Louisiana Sweet (USCSLLSS) ’s premium to
WTI rose $2 to $12.75 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  increased
$2.75 to $15.75.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained $1.75 to $13.25. Mars Blend
increased $1 to $10.40 over WTI and  Poseidon (USCSPOSE) ’s premium widened
$1.40 to $10.50 over the benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon (USCSSGCN)  increased $1.50 to $10.25 over WTI.
