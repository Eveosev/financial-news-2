European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  “saved” European lenders from possible nationalization
by offering them unlimited three-year loans,  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT) 
Chairman Franco Bernabe said.  “Draghi saved the European banking system, which was
heading straight toward nationalization,” Bernabe told
reporters at a book presentation in Milan today.  The ECB provided 489 billion euros ($645 billion) in three-
year cash to banks on Dec. 21, and will offer funds at that
maturity again on Feb. 28. The coming refinancing operation
“will make the companies’ financing system more liquid,”
Bernabe said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
