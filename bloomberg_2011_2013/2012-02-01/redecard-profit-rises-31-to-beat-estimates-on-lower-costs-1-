Redecard SA (RDCD3) ,  Brazil ’s second-largest
card-payment processor by market value, said fourth-quarter
profit rose 31 percent and surpassed analysts estimates after it
cut transactions costs and reduced headcount.  Adjusted net income, which excludes some items, increased
to 456.9 million reais ($263.5 million), from 348.7 million
reais a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing. The Sao
Paulo-based company beat the 402 million reais  mean  estimate of
11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Operating costs declined 20 percent to 116 million reais as
the company reduced media expenses, and made an internal
reorganization, Redecard said in the statement. Net operating
sales rose 14 percent to 1.01 billion reais. The value of
credit- and debit-card transactions rose 13 percent to 64.7
billion reais, Redecard said.  Chief Executive Officer Claudio Yamaguti led the company to
“efficiency gains as a result of the shrinking headcount” and
a “slight decrease” in transaction costs, Raquel Varela and
Flavio Yoshida, analysts at Sao Paulo-based Votorantim Corretora,
wrote in a Jan 19 report. They have a “buy” rating for the
company.  Redecard rose 0.3 percent to 31.40 reais in  Sao Paulo 
trading today. The shares have risen 7.6 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 14 percent for Brazil’s benchmark
Bovespa index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
