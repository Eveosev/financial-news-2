percent to 1,592.56.  LIVESTOCK  Hogs rose to a two-month high on speculation that
accelerating growth in  China , the world’s biggest pork consumer,
will boost demand for U.S. supplies.  The purchasing managers’ index in China topped analysts’
estimates last month, rising to 50.5 from 50.3 in December, the

expansion. Prices also climbed after a private report showed

exchange.  Statoil ASA failed to buy North Sea Forties crude even
after it bid at the highest in almost a month. No bids or offers
were made for Russian Urals after the grade’s differential to

loading at 15 cents more than dated Brent, the highest since
Jan. 6, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders monitoring
