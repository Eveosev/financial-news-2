Equity Residential and  AvalonBay
Communities Inc. (AVB) , the two biggest publicly traded apartment
owners in the U.S., said funds from operations climbed in the
fourth quarter as rising demand allowed for rent increases.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, at Equity Residential rose to $201.4 million, or 64 cents
a share, from $136.4 million, or 45 cents, a year earlier, the
Chicago-based real estate investment trust founded by  Sam Zell 
said today in a statement. Analysts expected FFO of 65 cents a
share, the average of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  At Alexandria, Virginia-based AvalonBay, FFO increased to
$113.4 million, or $1.19 a share, from $86.8 million, or $1.01.
The company was  expected  to have FFO of $1.22 a share, the
average of 21 analysts’ estimates.  Demand for rental apartments has soared in the face of an
improving  job market  that’s prompted college graduates to seek
their own housing, according to Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst
with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. Apartment rents
in the U.S. climbed 4.1 percent in the 12 months through
December, according to  Axiometrics Inc.  The Dallas-based
research firm projects a 6.7 percent increase in landlords’
rental revenue for the year from 2011.  With the economy growing slowly and little new supply,
“apartment landlords have been in a very good spot,” Goldfarb,
who has a “hold” rating on AvalonBay and a “buy” rating on
 Equity Residential (EQR) , said in an interview before earnings were
announced.  Rental Revenue Rises  Rental revenue at Equity Residential, the largest U.S.
apartment REIT, climbed 13 percent to $516.9 million.
AvalonBay’s rental revenue rose 6.2 percent to $176.8 million.  “We are confident that multifamily fundamentals will
remain strong as we see no let up in demand and little new
supply which will keep retention high, vacancy low and rental
rates on the rise,” David J. Neithercut, Equity Residential’s
chief executive officer, said in the company’s statement today.  Fourth-quarter results were released after the close of
regular U.S. trading. Equity Residential rose 0.8 percent to
$60.02 today in New York. The shares have gained 9.9 percent in
the past 12 months, compared with a 14 percent increase in the
Bloomberg REIT Apartment Index of 16 companies.  AvalonBay rose 0.7 percent to $136.92. Its shares have
gained 19 percent in the past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
