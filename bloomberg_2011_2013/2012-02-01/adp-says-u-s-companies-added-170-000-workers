Companies added 170,000 workers in
January, reflecting job gains in services and at small
businesses, according to a private report based on payrolls.  The increase was less than forecast and followed a revised
292,000 rise the prior month that was smaller than previously
reported, the report from the Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP
Employer Services showed today. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of economists called for an advance of
182,000.  “The job market continues to grow at a moderate pace,”
 Jonathan Basile , a senior economist at Credit Suisse in  New
York , said before the report. “We’re on a gradually improving
path for the labor market.”  More hiring is needed to spur  consumer spending , which
accounts for about 70 percent of the world’s largest economy. A
Labor Department report in two days may show payrolls last month
rose by 145,000 and the  unemployment rate  held at 8.5 percent,
economists in a Bloomberg survey projected.  The projections for the change ADP employment ranged from
145,000 to 300,000, based on the estimates of 40 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The slowdown in hiring from the prior month may be
explained by the so-called purge effect. Workers, regardless of
when they are dismissed or quit, sometimes remain on company
records until December, when businesses update, or purge, their
figures with ADP.  The paycheck processor estimates this change when adjusting
its data for seasonal variations and, because there were fewer
firings at the end of 2011 than in previous years, ADP may have
found it more difficult to formulate a projection.  ‘Some Firming’  “Employment grew in all the major sectors of the
economy,”  Joel Prakken , senior managing director at
Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in  St. Louis , which produces the data
with ADP, said in a statement. “Other indicators suggest some
firming of labor market conditions as well.”  ADP’s initial figures for December showed a 325,000 gain,
while the Labor Department’s data a day later registered an
increase of 212,000 in private payrolls for the month.  Goods-producing industries, which include manufacturers and
construction companies, climbed by 18,000 workers, today’s ADP
figures showed. Employment in factories added 10,000 jobs.  Service providers took on 152,000 workers.  Companies employing more than 499 workers added 3,000 jobs.
Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to 499 employees, added 72,000
workers and small companies increased payrolls by 95,000, ADP
said.  Federal Reserve  Concern about the high number of jobless Americans is one
reason why the  Federal Reserve  last week said it would keep its
benchmark lending rate near zero “at least” until late 2014
from a prior target of mid-2013.  “While indicators point to some further improvement in
overall labor market conditions, the  unemployment rate  remains
elevated,” Fed policy makers said after their meeting.  The Labor Department’s report in two days may show private
payrolls rose by 165,000 in January, according to the Bloomberg
survey median. Overall hiring, which includes government jobs,
may have slowed to 145,000 after rising 200,000 in December.  The ADP report is based on data from about 344,000
businesses with more than 21 million workers on payrolls.
