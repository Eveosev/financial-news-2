Dar Al Arkan Real Estate Development
Co. (ALARKAN)  was among the biggest gainers in Saudi Arabia’s benchmark
stock index on investor speculation the company will benefit
from about $500 billion in  government spending .  The stock surged 8.5 percent, the most since May 2009, to
8.9 riyals at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh as the  volume of
shares  traded jumped to the highest since November 2009. The
shares were the third-biggest gainer on Saudi Arabia’s  Tadawul
All Share Index (SASEIDX) , which advanced 0.6 percent to 6,663.48, the
highest since June 1. Dar Al Arkan’s shares, up 23 percent this
year, trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 9 times compared
with 14 times for the country’s benchmark.  “Dar Al Arkan has been under the radar of investors for
some time now because of its attractive price-to-earnings
ratio,” Abdullah Alawi, head of research at  Jeddah , Saudi
Arabia-based Aljazira Capital, said in an e-mailed response to
questions. The gains have also been driven by “the buoyant
sentiment among investors toward large real estate companies in
the  kingdom , which are believed to benefit from the massive
upcoming housing projects financed by the government.”  King Abdullah  announced a $130 billion plan in 2011 to
build homes and create jobs to stave off regional protests that
toppled leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt . The rulings added to a
commitment in 2010 to spend $384 billion over five years on
housing, transport and education. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is
constructing the world’s tallest tower in Jeddah at a cost of
$1.2 billion.  Cash Position  Dar Al Arkan, the second-biggest real estate company in
 Saudi Arabia  by market value, posted a fourth-quarter profit on
Jan. 18 that beat analysts’ estimates. The company said last
week it ended 2011 with a “strong cash position” of 2.5
billion riyals ($667 million), more than twice as much as in
2010.  Dar Al Arkan led advances today on the  Real Estate
Development Industries Index (SASEREAL) , which has gained 9.2 percent so
far this year. The shares declined 19 percent  in 2011 .  Ten analysts including Alawi recommend investors  buy the
shares  of the company, while five have a hold rating on the
stock, according to Bloomberg data. One analyst recommends
investors sell the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
