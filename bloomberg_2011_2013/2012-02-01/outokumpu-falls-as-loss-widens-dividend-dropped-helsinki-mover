Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V) ,  Finland ’s biggest
stainless-steel producer, declined again in Helsinki trading
today for the biggest four-day drop since January 1991 after
saying it won’t pay a dividend this year.  Outokumpu fell as much as 14 percent today, the steepest
decline on the  OMX Helsinki 25 Index . The stock shed 55 cents,
or 8.8 percent, to 5.72 euros at 11:28 a.m. in the Finnish
capital, giving the Espoo-based company a market value of 1
billion euros ($1.3 billion). The shares have declined as much
as 32 percent in four days.  The company said today it will omit a dividend payout for
the  first time  since at least 1992 after reporting its fourth
consecutive annual loss. Outokumpu yesterday agreed to buy
ThyssenKrupp AG’s stainless steel unit in  Germany  for about 2.7
billion euros to create  Europe ’s largest maker of the alloy.  Outokumpu’s fourth-quarter  net loss  widened to 113 million
euros, exceeding the 63.4 million-euro loss estimated by 10
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Analysts expected a 20-cent
dividend payout for the year.  In the current quarter, the underlying operating result may
be break-even or “slightly” positive, held back by one-time
costs to improve efficiency, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
