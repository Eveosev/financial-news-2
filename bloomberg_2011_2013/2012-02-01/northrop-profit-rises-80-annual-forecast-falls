Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , the maker of
the U.S. military’s Global Hawk drone, said fourth-quarter
profit rose 80 percent and forecast 2012 earnings that fell
short of analysts’ estimates.  Net income from continuing operations was $550 million, or
$2.09 a share, compared with $306 million, or $1.03, a year
earlier, the company said today in a statement. The average
estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was $1.67 a share.
Sales fell 5.8 percent to $6.51 billion.  Northrop forecast 2012 profit from continuing operations of
$6.40 to $6.70 a share on sales of $24.7 billion to $25.4
billion. Analysts had estimated $6.82 a share on sales of $26.1
billion.  While the results and forecast were disappointing,
“Northrop and other defense companies are seeing their profit
margins rise because projects they have taken on in the past
decade are nearing completion,”  Joel Levington , a bond analyst
at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in  New York , said in an
e-mailed statement.  Northrop’s Chief Executive Officer Wes Bush has divested
units that presented a conflict with U.S. rules on contracting
or were dragging down the company’s profits. In March 2011,
Northrop  spun off  its $6.7 billion shipbuilding unit as
 Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (HII) .  Northrop’s remaining businesses include electronics,
aerospace, information systems and technical services. Some of
its major programs, including the Global Hawk unmanned plane and
work on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, are coming under U.S.
budget pressure.  Pentagon Cutback  The Pentagon has proposed curbing purchases of one version
of the Global Hawk because it’s too expensive to operate. The
company also is a subcontractor to  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  on the
F-35, which is facing delays.  Northrop, based in  Falls Church , Virginia, rose 2.1 percent
to $59.25 at the close in New York and has declined 7.1 percent
in the past 12 months.  For the quarter, sales at the Electronic Systems unit,
which makes military radar, declined less than 1 percent to
$1.87 billion. Profit fell 5.9 percent to $256 million from $272
million a year earlier.  Sales at the Aerospace unit, which makes the Global Hawk
drones, fell 4.1 percent during the quarter to $2.56 billion.
Operating income rose less than 1 percent to $325 million from
$322 million a year earlier. The unit’s revenue declined partly
because of less work on F-35 program as well as reduced funding
on weather satellites, Northrop said in the statement.  Sales at the  Information Systems  unit, which provides
computer systems services to military and civilian agencies,
declined 8.4 percent to $1.91 billion, Northrop said. Profit
increased 10.1 percent to $196 million.  Revenue at the Technical Services unit, which provides
logistics and training services, fell 15.1 percent to $675
million and profit rose 14.3 percent to $56 million, the company
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
