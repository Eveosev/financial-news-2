International Atomic Energy Agency 
inspectors didn’t visit any nuclear sites during a three-day
visit to Iran that ended yesterday, the official  Islamic
Republic News Agency  reported, citing an unidentified official.  The aim of the IAEA delegation was to hold talks with
Iranian officials and the climate of meetings was positive and
constructive, IRNA cited the official as saying.  There have been growing tensions between Iran and western
nations, which say the country is using its nuclear program as a
cover for developing weapons. Iran rejects the allegation,
saying it needs the technology for power generation and medical
research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
