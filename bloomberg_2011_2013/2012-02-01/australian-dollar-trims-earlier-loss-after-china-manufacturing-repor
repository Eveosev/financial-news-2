The Australian dollar trimmed an
earlier decline after a report indicated that Chinese
manufacturing expanded in January.  The Australian currency fetched $1.0613 at 12:06 p.m. in
Sydney from $1.0605 before the release and $1.0621 yesterday in
 New York .  A purchasing managers’ index for Chinese manufacturing
unexpectedly rose to 50.5 in January from 50.3 the month before.
The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for
the PMI to fall to 49.6. Figures below 50 indicate contraction.  The  New Zealand dollar  strengthened briefly before trading
at 82.49 U.S. cents. It fetched 82.51 before the release and
82.68 yesterday.  China is Australia’s largest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-biggest export destination.  To contact the reporter on this story:
