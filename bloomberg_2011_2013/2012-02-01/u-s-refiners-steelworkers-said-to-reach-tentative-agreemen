U.S. refiners and the United
Steelworkers reached tentative agreement on a new three-year
contract, averting a potential strike that would have idled as
many as 69 plants, according to three union representatives with
direct knowledge of the talks.  The proposal includes pay increases of 2.5 percent in the
first year and 3 percent in the second and third years, said the
representatives who asked not to be named because the terms
havenâ€™t yet been made public.  The deal was reached today after negotiations that started
Jan. 14 in Austin, Texas, between the union representing 30,000
workers and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , which was bargaining on
behalf of the companies. The current agreement expires at
midnight Houston time.  Other companies involved include  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ,  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  BP Plc (BP/) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP) , Chevron Corp., Marathon Oil
Corp., Sunoco Inc.,  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  and PBF Energy Inc.  If no deal was reached, the union could have called a
general strike or agreed to extend negotiations in 24-hour
increments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
