Billerud AB (BILL) , Europe’s second-largest
manufacturer of sack paper, agreed to buy  UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V) ’s
packaging paper businesses in Pietarsaari and Tervasaari for 130
million euros ($171 million.)  The deal gives Billerud machines used to make sack and
packaging paper for the food, retail, and construction
industries and will be financed with cash and debt via existing
credit facilities, the Stockholm-based company said in a
statement today. The plants had sales of 220 million euros last
year, Billerud said.  “The acquisition will give us a strong platform to
continue developing our offering within smarter packaging
solutions,” Billerud Chief Executive Officer Per Lindberg said
in a statement. “In addition, the acquisition significantly
reduces our pulp exposure and adds a much larger euro cost base,
which we view positively.”  The deal marks the second sale of a Nordic packaging
business in two weeks. Last month DS Smith Plc agreed to buy
most of  Sweden ’s Svenska Cellulosa AB’s packaging operations for
1.6 billion euros. Svenska Cellulosa sees a need for
consolidation in the industry, it said then.  UPM-Kymmene, Europe’s second-biggest papermaker, rose as
much as 4.6 percent and traded 2.3 percent higher at 10.12 euros
as of 11 a.m. in Helsinki. Billerud fell as much as 5.9 percent
and was down 2.9 percent at 58 kronor in  Stockholm .  To contact the reporters on this story:
