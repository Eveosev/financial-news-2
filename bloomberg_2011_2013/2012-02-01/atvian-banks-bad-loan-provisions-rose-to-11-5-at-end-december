Latvian banking industry provisions
for bad loans rose to 11.5 percent in the fourth quarter from
11.3 percent a year earlier, the country’s banking regulator in
Riga said today in an e-mailed statement.  Total overdue loans were 24.5 percent of total credits,
while loans that were overdue by more than 90 days fell to 17.2
percent at the end of December, compared with 18 percent at the
end of September, according to the statement.  The Latvian bank industry reported a loss of 179 million
lati ($337 million) last year, mostly due to the suspension of
Latvijas Krajbanka AS, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
