French food companies can label
products as “GMO Free” to indicate they contain no or trace
amounts of genetically modified crops, the government said.  Rules will take effect July 1 for producers that want to
label foods as biotechnology-free after ministers signed a
decree yesterday, according to a joint e-mailed statement from
four ministries today.  Existing regulations require labels to indicate the
presence of genetically modified organisms, according to the
statement. Adding GMO-free labeling will allow producers to
distinguish their goods and increase consumer choice, the
ministries said.  “This decree, awaited by consumer associations, defines
the product labeling rules for operators who want to develop a
production without GMO,” the ministries said. “The indication
of the absence of GMO in food will allow consumers to fully
exercise their choice.”  Plant-based ingredients including flour and starch will be
able to carry the GMO-free tag if their content of biotech crops
is less than 0.1 percent, according to the statement. Animal-
based ingredients including meat and eggs can indicate livestock
ate feed with content of genetically modified crops that was
below either 0.1 percent or 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
