CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic â€™s biggest
utility, won 74,000 retail clients in Slovakia last year as it
pledged to supply electricity and gas cheaper than the
competition.  CEZ entered the Slovak retail market in January 2011 and in
the first year supplied about 1.5 terrawatt-hours of energy to
retail clients in the country, the company said in a press
release distributed to journalists before a press conference in
Bratislava, Slovakia, today. For this year, it already has
contracts for 2.2 terrawatt-hours, the utility said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
