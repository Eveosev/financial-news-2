Gordon Ramsay  and his father-in-law
Chris Hutcheson have reached a settlement and dropped all claims
against each other, ending a dispute that broke out in October
2010 when the chef ousted Hutcheson from his company.  “We can confirm that Gordon Ramsay and Gordon Ramsay
Holdings have reached a settlement with Chris Hutcheson and
other members of the Hutcheson family,” Gordon Ramsay Holdings
said today in an e-mailed statement via Freud Communications.  “The terms of the settlement are confidential,” the e-
mail said, “but we can confirm that Chris Hutcheson is no
longer a director or shareholder of Gordon Ramsay Holdings and
all civil litigation and employment tribunal claims brought by
each of the two parties and other family members have been
withdrawn.”  Hutcheson, the father of Ramsay’s wife Tana, remained a
shareholder in London-based Gordon Ramsay Holdings after Ramsay
fired him as chief executive. The chef said in  an open letter  
-- published in the Evening Standard on Nov. 9, 2010 -- that he
ousted Hutcheson after hiring a private detective to investigate
him.  Hutcheson in a newspaper interview had accused Ramsay
previously of being a monster who was subject to mood swings.  (Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Muse, the arts
