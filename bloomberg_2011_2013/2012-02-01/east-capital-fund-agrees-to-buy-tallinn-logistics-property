East Capital , a Stockholm-based  fund
manager  investing in eastern  Europe , agreed to buy a logistics
property in the Estonian capital Tallinn from  VGP NV (VGP)  for about
24 million euros ($31.7 million).  East Capital would set up a second real-estate fund in the
Baltic region to purchase a newly built property of 40,000
square meters in Tallinn’s Tanassilma industrial and logistics
area, with an expected closing date of May 15, the company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  VGP plans to use part of the sales proceeds for new
development projects in Estonia, which remains an attractive
niche market, it said in a separate  statement  on its website.  “There is an opportunity to invest in the Baltic real-
estate market at attractive yields,” Biljana Pehrsson, Head of
East Capital Real Estate, said. “The outlook for the  property
market  is positive in the medium term and the trend is for
institutional investors to increase the weight of real-estate
assets in their asset allocation.”  East Capital Explorer has committed to invest 10 million
euros in the first closing of the new fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
