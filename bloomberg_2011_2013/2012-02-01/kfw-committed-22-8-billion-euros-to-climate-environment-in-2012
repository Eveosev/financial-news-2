KfW,  Germany ’s state-owned
development bank, committed 22.8 billion euros ($30 billion) to
climate and environment projects last year, almost a third of
all its lending, and said it will increase this share in 2012.  The bank provided about 32 percent of all its funding to
these areas, compared with 31 percent in the previous year,
Wolfram Schweickhardt, a KfW spokesman, said today by e-mail. In
2010, such lending amounted to 25.3 billion euros, he said.  KfW, based in  Frankfurt , was the sixth-largest funder of
renewable energy assets worldwide last year, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. It provided funding for two of the
10 largest deals of the year, both offshore wind parks, data
compiled by the research firm shows.  Funding for climate and environment last year comprised
10.1 billion euros for  energy efficiency , 9.4 billion euros for
renewable energy and 3.3 billion for other areas such as waste
control, Schweickhardt said.  KfW is the largest lender to renewable projects in Germany,
 Europe ’s biggest market for clean energy. More than 41 percent
of all renewable energy investment in the country last year was
funded by the bank, according to the spokesman.  Demand for loans for solar projects there dropped during
2011 due to reduced subsidies as commitments for energy
efficiency increased, KfW said today in an e-mailed statement.  The bank also supports projects in countries such as France
and India. It bought a stake in France’s largest solar plant
last month and agreed to loan 250 million euros to build  India ’s
biggest solar park in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
