Vnesheсonombank (VNECB) , the Russian state
development bank known as VEB, may steer pension money into
infrastructure after freight logjams delayed coal and metals
shipments from Siberia last year.  “Infrastructure is among our top priorities,” Chairman
 Vladimir Dmitriev  said in an interview in Davos,  Switzerland .
VEB, the biggest manager of Russian pension savings, is prepared
to invest the funds into transport projects to boost returns and
overcome congestion at railways, he said.  The investment will help contain growth in rail tariffs
without additional budget expenditure, Dmitriev said. The lender
signed an  agreement  last month with producers and OAO Russian
Railways, the state monopoly and operator of the world’s longest
train network, to help finance and develop the rail system to
meet industrial demand.  “Some coal miners are facing a threatening situation,”
Dmitriev said. The bank may channel “tens and hundreds of
billions of rubles” into railroad development, he said.  Coal supplies in Kuzbass last year reached a record of more
than 186 million metric tons, and exports doubled in the last
eight years, Russian Railways data show.  Low rail shipping capacity resulted in late deliveries for
Russian steelmakers, coal miners and gas producers last year,
according to the Kommersant newspaper.
