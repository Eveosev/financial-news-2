Leeds fired coach Simon Grayson with
the soccer team in 10th place in  England ’s second-tier
Championship.  Grayson and his coaching staff were dismissed with 18 games
to go in the season after three years in charge, the team said
today on its website. Leeds is four spots out of playoff
contention with 42 points, 11 points behind the leaders, West
Ham United.  The squad is “still within touching distance of the
playoffs, but felt with the transfer window now closed we needed
to make the change,” Leeds Chief Executive Officer Shaun Harvey
said in the statement. Management has the “belief that a new
managerial team will be able to get more out of the existing
squad of players and make the difference.”  Youth team manager Neil Redfearn will take charge of the
first team until a new coach is hired, the team said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
