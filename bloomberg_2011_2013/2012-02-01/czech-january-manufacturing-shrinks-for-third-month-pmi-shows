Czech manufacturing worsened for a
third month in January as the euro area’s debt crisis curbed
demand for the country’s exports, an industry gauge showed.  The HSBC Czech Republic Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.8,
compared with 49.2 in December, the bank said today in an e-
mailed report. A result greater than 50 signals growth.  “A number of firms reported weakening demand from western
European markets, and new export orders also fell for the third
successive survey,” the bank said in the report, compiled by
Markit, a financial information services company.  Czech economic  growth  depends on demand for its products
from the European Union as the bloc buys about 80 percent of the
country’s exports, with Germany accounting for a third. The
Finance Ministry yesterday cut its forecast of 2012 gross
domestic product growth to 0.2 percent, from 1 percent and said
the outlook carried downside risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
