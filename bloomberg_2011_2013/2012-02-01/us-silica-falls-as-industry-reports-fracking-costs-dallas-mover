US Silica Holdings Inc. (SLCA) , a provider
of sand to energy companies, fell in its first day of trading as
other oilfield suppliers struggle to contain costs related to
moving from natural-gas to crude basins.  The company, which initially priced 11.8 million shares at
$17 each, fell 5.9 percent to $16 at the close in  New York .  “The industry is having challenges all around from a
logistics standpoint to operationally,” John Keller, an analyst
at Stephens Inc. in Houston, who doesn’t rate US Silica, said in
an interview today.  US Silica, based in Frederick,  Maryland , sells sand to oil
and gas companies for use in hydraulic fracturing, a technique
that pumps the material down a well with chemicals and millions
of gallons of water to free crude from underground rock.
Fracking-service providers and sand suppliers are currently
facing higher costs as they shift their equipment and materials
from gas basins to oil-producing fields where customers are
boosting work, said Keller.  Carbo Ceramics Inc. (CRR) , the largest provider of manufactured
fracking material that’s similar to sand, said Jan. 26 it had
higher freight and logistics costs in the fourth quarter as
customers moved away from gas basins and into oil plays in the
U.S. and  Canada .  Gas producers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. and EQT Corp.
have announced they’re curtailing production because of low gas
prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
