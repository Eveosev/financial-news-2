Investigators probing the collapse of
 MF Global Holdings Ltd (MFGLQ) . have located almost all the client money
that went missing when the broker filed for bankruptcy last
year, according to a person briefed on the matter.  The investigators have tracked about 90 percent of the
missing funds, which were supposed to be kept in segregated
accounts for futures customers, to other customer or bank
accounts, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the investigation is private. The bankruptcy trustee
overseeing the liquidation has estimated that as much as $1.2
billion in customers’ funds went missing.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Securities and
Exchange Commission,  Justice Department  and bankruptcy trustee
are investigating MF Global, which filed for  bankruptcy
protection  on Oct. 31.  Investigators are attempting to determine which
transactions involving customer funds were illegitimate, Jill E. Sommers, the senior CFTC commissioner overseeing the
investigation, said in an interview in December.  If a transaction that was legitimate in the beginning
“becomes illegitimate” later in a chain of transactions, then
the chance of recovering the funds could be slim, she said. “It
may be gone,” Sommers said in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
