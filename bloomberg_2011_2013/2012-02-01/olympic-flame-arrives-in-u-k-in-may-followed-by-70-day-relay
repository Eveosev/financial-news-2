The Olympic flame that will burn in
the Olympic stadium during the  London 2012 Games  is scheduled to
arrive in Britain from  Greece  on May 17, before going on a 70-
day torch relay across the nation, organizers said.  The flame will be lit May 10 at the Temple of Hera in
Olympia, Greece, among the historic ruins of the home of the
ancient  Olympic Games , the  London  2012 organizing committee said
in an e-mailed statement today.  It will be taken around the Greek mainland for eight days,
before being handed over to the London Games at the Panathenaic
Stadium in  Athens  on May 17.  British Airways, a sponsor of the London Games, will carry
the Olympic flame aboard its BA2012 flight to Royal Naval Air
Station Culdrose in Cornwall the following day, local organizers
said.  The torch relay will start at Land’s End on May 19, and
will take the Olympic flame 8,000 miles across the U.K. to what
organizers say will be within 10 miles of 95 percent of the
British population. The torch will be carried for 300 meters
each by 8,000 torchbearers until it reaches London’s Olympic
Stadium on the evening of July 27 for the opening ceremony.  The Olympic flame’s 129-day global journey to the 2008
Beijing Games was mired in controversy, as it attracted
violence, led to reshuffled routes and sparked criticism from
groups pressing  China  over human rights.  To contact the reporters on this story:
