Indonesia ’s rupiah fell the most in a
week as official data today showed exports from  Southeast Asia ’s
biggest economy grew the least in more than two years. Bonds
gained as inflation eased for a fifth month.  Overseas sales  rose 2.2 percent in December from a year
earlier, the least since September 2009, the statistics
department said today. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had
predicted a 3.5 percent gain. The currency dropped toward a two-
week low after exchange data showed global funds sold $95
million more local shares than they bought in the first two days
of this week.  “The export data will be a reminder that Indonesia isn’t
isolated from what’s going on in the world,” said  Gundy Cahyadi ,
an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in
Singapore. “The European crisis is putting pressure on
currencies.”  The rupiah dropped 0.4 percent to 9,034 per dollar as of
3:20 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency gained 0.8 percent in
January, advancing for a second month.  Consumer prices in Indonesia rose 3.65 percent last month
from a year earlier after climbing 3.79 percent in December, the
 Central Bureau of Statistics  said today. The median estimate of
24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 3.61 percent
increase.  The rate on the government’s benchmark bonds fell the most
in almost two weeks. The yield on the 7 percent notes due May
2022 fell 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage point, to 5.24
percent today, according to midday prices by the Inter-Dealer
Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
