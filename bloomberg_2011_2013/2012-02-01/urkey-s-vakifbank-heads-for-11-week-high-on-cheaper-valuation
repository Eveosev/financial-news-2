Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN) , a
state-run lender, headed for its highest level in 11 weeks,
after a 30 percent fourth-quarter plunge made it attractive on
the basis of relative valuation.  Vakifbank shares surged 5.9 percent to 3.06 liras, its
strongest close since Nov. 11. Akbank TAS, part-owned by
Citigroup Inc., was the only one among  Turkey ’s 16 listed banks
to outperform Vakifbank. Akbank jumped 6 percent to 7.08 liras.  “Vakifbank is the most attractive large-cap Turkish bank
in terms of multiples,” Ates Buldur, an analyst at Credit
Suisse Group AG, said in an e-mail.  The bank’s current price-to-book ratio is 0.8 compared to
the Turkish banking index’s 1.4, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Its price-to-earnings ratio is at 5.4 compared with
8.7 for the industry, implying the stock is trading cheaper than
its peer group.  Vakifbank has plummeted 18 percent since October compared
with a 9.8 percent decline in the banking index. It has
catapulted 25 percent this year, outpacing a 17 percent advance
for the industry. The bank deserves a “higher valuation and the
market has been realizing it in the past couple of weeks,”
Sadrettin Bagci, an analyst at Yatirim Finansman Securities, a
broker, said.  The bank’s earnings may lag fourth-quarter estimates,
according to Bagci, who forecasts net income of less than 250
million liras ($142 million) compared with an estimate of 284
million liras, according to the median of seven estimates on
Bloomberg. The bank will announce its financial results on Feb.
