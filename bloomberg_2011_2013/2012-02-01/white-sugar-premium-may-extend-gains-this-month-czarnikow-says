The premium for white sugar over raw
sweetener will extend gains before March futures in  London 
expire on limited supplies for delivery from  Thailand ,  India  and
the European Union, C. Czarnikow Sugar Futures Ltd. said.  White sugar for March delivery was $107.42 a metric ton
more than raw sugar for delivery in the same month at 1:49 p.m.
in London,  data  on Bloomberg show. It’s jumped 22 percent this
year alone and is above the five-year average of $98.  “Thai mills are focusing more on producing raws this
season, the Indian white sugar cannot be delivered due to its
quality specification and EU sugar is technically un-deliverable
against the exchange,” Peter de Klerk, an analyst at London-
based Czarnikow, said by phone from London today. “We may
see the white premium get stronger before the March expiry.”  White sugar for March delivery was at $626.60 a ton on NYSE
Liffe in London and raw sugar for March delivery was 23.55 cents
a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The white sugar
contract expires Feb. 14.  Sugar millers in Thailand, the world’s second-largest
exporter, have directed less than 29 percent of the first 40
million tons of sugar cane crushed through Jan. 23 to
production of white sugar, de Klerk said. That compares to a
third of the cane a year earlier, he said. The sugar cane
harvest in Thailand usually starts in November. The crops in the
EU and in India start being harvested in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
