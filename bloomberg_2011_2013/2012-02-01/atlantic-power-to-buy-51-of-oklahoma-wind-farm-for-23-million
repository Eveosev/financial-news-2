Atlantic Power Corp. (ATP) , a Boston-based
independent power producer, agreed to buy a 51 percent stake in
a 298-megawatt wind farm in Oklahoma for $23 million.  Construction on the $460 million Canadian Hills project,
about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of  Oklahoma City , will begin
in April, and it’s expected to begin producing electricity by
November, Atlantic Power said today in a statement.  Apex Wind Energy Inc., based in Charlottesville, Virginia,
is developing the project, which will use turbines from Repower
Systems SE and  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)   The project has long-term power-purchase agreements to sell
250.45 megawatts of capacity and is in talks to sell the
remainder, according to the statement, which didn’t name the
buyers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
