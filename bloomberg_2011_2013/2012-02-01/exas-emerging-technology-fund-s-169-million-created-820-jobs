Texas (STOTX1) ’s Emerging Technology Fund,
used by Governor  Rick Perry  to attract business to the second-
most populous state, has committed $192.7 million in 133 awards
since 2006, resulting in 820 new jobs, the fund said.  Investments ranged from $250,000 to $5 million in
companies, according to the fund’s annual report. The total
awarded amounts to more than $200,000 per job, the figures show.
The state held equity valued at $173.9 million as of Aug. 31, a
2.7 percent increase from disbursements of $169.3 million.  Texas is “attracting exactly the sort of private-sector
investment the fund was designed to encourage,” Perry, a
Republican, said in a Jan. 30 statement. “The state’s
investments have attracted more than $592.3 million in private-
sector and other funding to supplement these efforts.”  The biggest job creator was Xtreme Power Inc., which added
181 jobs after being awarded $2 million in March 2007, according
to the report. The Kyle, Texas-based company, which designs
energy storage and power-management systems, had revenue of more
than $30 million in 2011.  No other recipient created more than 43 jobs.  An April report by  Texas  Auditor John Keel criticized the
fund for limited monitoring of performance by recipients and a
lack of public votes and record-keeping by the governing board.
The report also suggested that committee members should be
required to file annual financial-disclosure statements and not
be allowed to invest with or be paid by grant recipients.  Perry, 61, agreed to some of the auditor’s requests,
including maintaining board-meeting minutes to document members’
votes on grant recommendations. He disputed others, contending
that the auditor misunderstood the fund’s purpose.  About $177 million has been spent on research projects
connected to state universities, according to the report. The
fund said it has targeted investments with a goal of “creating
more innovative ideas in Texas and keeping them here, from the
laboratory to the marketplace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
