Belgium  entered a recession for the
second time in three years as the economic contraction deepened
in the final months of last year.  Gross domestic product in Belgium, the sixth-largest
economy in the euro area, fell 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter
from the previous three-month period, the National Bank of
Belgium said today in an e-mailed statement. The economy
expanded 0.9 percent from the year-earlier period and grew 1.9
percent in the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
