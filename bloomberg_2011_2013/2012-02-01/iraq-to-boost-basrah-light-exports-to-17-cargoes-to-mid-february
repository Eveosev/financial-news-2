  Iraq  will ship 17 cargoes of  Basrah
Light (ZOSPBLAS)  crude oil for loading in the first half of February from
the  Persian Gulf , two more than in the second half of January,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  A total of 28.06 million barrels, or 1.87 million barrels a
day, will be loaded from Basrah Oil Terminal, the plan showed.
The program comprises 12 cargoes of 2 million barrels each, two
shipments of 1 million barrels, two 715,000-barrel lots and one
630,000-barrel consignment.  Basrah Light has a density of 30.2 degrees on the American
Petroleum Institute scale and a sulfur content of 2.92 percent,
according to BP Plc. That makes it a so-called medium sour
crude, which yields less higher-value refined products than
benchmark grades such as Brent.  Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled
by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their
supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
