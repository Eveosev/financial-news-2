Australia & New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. (ANZ)  was voted the best bank for syndicated loans in the Asia-
Pacific region by the area’s market association.  The Melbourne-based  lender  got 28 percent of the votes at
the Asia-Pacific Loan Market Association’s 2011 Syndicated Loan
Awards evening held at the Hong Kong Football Club yesterday.
Bloomberg News was the official media partner for the event,
which more than 200 guests attended.  HSBC Holdings Plc was selected as the best Asia-Pacific
syndicated corporate loan house for 2011, while the award for
project finance lending went to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.  League tables compiled by Bloomberg were given to all APLMA
members for voting, allowing key market practitioners to have
their deals recognized by their peers based on merit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
