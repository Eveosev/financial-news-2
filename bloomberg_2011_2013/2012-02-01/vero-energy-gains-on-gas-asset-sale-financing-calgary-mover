Vero Energy Inc. (VRO) , a Canadian company
that’s shedding natural-gas properties to search for oil, rose
the most in a month after completing its sale of gas fields and
getting additional bank financing.  Vero rose 6.9 percent to C$2.95 at the close in Toronto,
the biggest gain since Jan. 4 and its highest price since Nov.
10.  Vero will use the C$209 million ($209.5 million) it raised
from the sale of gas properties in western  Alberta  to pay down
debt and boost oil drilling activity, the Calgary-based company
said in a statement released after markets closed yesterday. The
company also reported that it obtained a C$45 million line of
credit from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.  “The team’s attention and technical expertise are now 100
percent focused on developing its Cardium light-oil assets,”
Chief Executive Officer Doug Bartole said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
