China ’s banking regulator asked the
country’s five largest  banks  to conduct stress tests on lending
to local government financing vehicles and on property loans,
the 21st Century Business Herald  reported .  The regulator, which held a meeting with large banks Jan.
11-12, is also focusing on wealth management products and shadow
banking as areas of potential risk, the newspaper said, citing
unidentified people. A total of 14 percent of the five banks’
outstanding loans are to local government financing platforms,
according to the Herald.  The banks were asked to examine the systemic risk from the
interaction among the four areas and report the results before
the end of the first quarter, the newspaper said.  China’s local governments had 10.7 trillion yuan ($1.7
trillion) of debt at the end of 2010, including 8.5 trillion
yuan of bank loans, the nation’s auditor said in June. More than
5 trillion yuan of the total matures before 2013. China’s banks
should conduct stress tests “regularly” on credit risks and
closely monitor cash-flow coverage of loans,  Shang Fulin , head
of the CBRC, wrote in Caijing Magazine Jan. 16.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission’s press office had
no immediate comment on the article.  China’s five biggest banks are  Industrial & Commercial Bank
of China Ltd. ,  China Construction Bank Corp. (939) ,  Bank of China
Ltd. (3988) ,  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288)  and Bank of Communications
Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
