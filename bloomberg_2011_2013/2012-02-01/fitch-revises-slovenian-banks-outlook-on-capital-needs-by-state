Slovenia’s state-owned banks,
including the largest Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., had their
outlook revised to negative by  Fitch Ratings  after the company
cut the sovereign rating of the euro region country.  Fitch affirmed NLB and  Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor d.d. ’s
long-term issuer default ratings at BBB and revised their
outlooks to negative from stable, the rating company said in a
statement today.  The revision reflects the “negative outlook on the
sovereign, and hence the potential for further weakening of the
Slovenian government’s ability to provide support to the
banks,” Fitch analysts led by Lindsey Liddell and Michal Bryks
said in the statement. “There is a significant risk that the
sovereign will need to contribute heavily to future bank
recapitalization in Slovenia.”  Slovenian lenders are still struggling with the impact of
the 2009 recession with the worsening economic outlook for this
year probably increasing their reserves to cover bad loans.
Slovenian lawmakers on Jan. 28 nominated  Janez Jansa  as the new
Prime Minister to replace the government of Borut Pahor that was
toppled in September. The new Cabinet may be in place by Feb.
10, according to Gregor Virant, one of the partners in the five-
way coalition.  Fitch cut the ratings on Slovenia by two levels to A from
AA- on Jan. 27 because of a lack of financing flexibility in the
face of the debt crisis in  Europe .  The rating company today also downgraded the government-
guaranteed notes of NLB and  Abanka Vipa (ABKN)  d.d. to A from AA-,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
