Bank of England Deputy Governor  Paul Tucker  said new international rules on bank regulation will
require closer monitoring of bank risks, creating a need for
credit analysts.  “A measure of success of our reforms will be that some
leading analysts will concentrate on debt rather than equity, on
the downside risks: credit analysts,” Tucker said at an event
in London today. “They will be needed.”  Tucker also said officials’ work to prevent taxpayers from
having to bail out risky banks will force other parts of the
financial sector to “stand on their own feet,” implying that
insurers will have to consider the implications of new rules.
Though insurers largely didn’t receive state support during the
crisis, those holding bank debt benefited from government
bailouts of the financial system, he said.  “We no more want insurance to be part of a ‘socialized’
financial sector than banking,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
