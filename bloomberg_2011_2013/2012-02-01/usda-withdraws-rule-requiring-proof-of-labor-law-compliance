The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
has withdrawn a plan requiring companies doing business with the
agency to certify that their subcontractors are meeting  labor
laws , after groups including the Chamber of Commerce complained.  The rule, proposed in December and set to go into effect
Feb. 29, was pulled after the USDA reviewed the complaints, Matt
Herrick, an agency spokesman said today in a telephone
interview. The department is going through comments it received
to consider how to proceed, he said.  The chamber, in a letter  last week , said it objected to the
USDA plan “in the strongest possible terms” as being unduly
burdensome to business and unfairly benefiting labor unions. The
American Meat Institute, the National Council of Farmer
Cooperatives and  Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) , which called the rule “ill-
advised and unworkable,” also  objected .  The rule would have governed USDA procurements, including
food for school meals and other nutrition programs and commodity
purchases for international food aid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
