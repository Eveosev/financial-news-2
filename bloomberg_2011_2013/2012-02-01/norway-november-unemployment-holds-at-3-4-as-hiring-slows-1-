Norway’s  unemployment rate  held at
the highest in six months as  Europe ’s debt crisis weighed on
demand and hiring.  Unemployment in the world’s second-richest nation per
capita held at 3.4 percent after being revised up in October,
 Statistics Norway  said today. The number of employed grew 1.7
percent to 2.56 million from a year earlier, after rising 1.8
percent in October.  The country’s central bank in December cut its benchmark
interest rate by 50 basis points to 1.75 percent to shield the
world’s seventh-largest oil exporter from the fallout of
Europe’s debt crisis. The nation sends more than 60 percent of
its exports to the region.  “Manufacturing export industries have to hire fewer
people,”  Erik Bruce , senior economist at Nordea Bank AB, said
by phone. “A lot of firms are holding back on new hiring, some
might reduce some employment.”  Companies such as Renewable Energy Corp. ASA, Europe’s
largest producer of solar wafers, as well as Norske
Skogindustrier ASA, the world’s second-largest maker of
newsprint, have announced jobs cuts amid waning demand and
falling prices for their goods.  Still, a survey of  purchasing managers  released today
showed manufacturing grew in January after shrinking for two
straight months as orders rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
