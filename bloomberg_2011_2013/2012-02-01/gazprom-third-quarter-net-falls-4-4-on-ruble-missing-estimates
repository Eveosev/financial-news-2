OAO Gazprom (GAZP) ,  Russia ’s natural-gas
exporter, said third-quarter profit fell 4.4 percent as the
ruble weakened, leading to a foreign exchange loss.  Net income declined to 152 billion rubles ($5 billion) from
159 billion rubles a year earlier, the Moscow-based company said
today in a financial report on its website. That missed the
average estimate of 154 billion rubles in a Bloomberg survey of
12 analysts.  Gazprom, which has dollar-denominated debt and costs in
rubles, was hurt as the Russian currency weakened an average 4.8
percent against the U.S. greenback. The world’s biggest gas
producer had a foreign exchange loss of 141 billion rubles,
compared with 6.8 billion rubles a year earlier, according to
its statement.  “Everyone will focus on the  cash flow  going forward,
because dividends come from that number and that’s the money
that stays in the company,” Sergey Vakhrameev, senior oil and
gas analyst at IFC Metropol, said by phone. “It isn’t clear
where the company spends this money, what the return is from
these investments.”  The company had negative free cash flow of 25.9 billion
rubles in the quarter. Capital expenditure jumped 65 percent in
the first nine months to 1.07 trillion rubles, according to the
report.  ‘High’ Investments  Gazprom’s investments have been “high” in the last two
years as it develops fields in the Yamal Peninsula in the
Arctic, where the company plans to pump more than half of its
gas by 2030, Andrei Kruglov, deputy chief executive officer,
said on a call with analysts.  Net income probably rose 25 percent last year to almost $40
billion, Gazprom said in a separate statement today, citing
preliminary numbers.  The shares rose 0.9 percent to 185.70 rubles in Moscow
today.  Revenue climbed 22 percent to 950 billion rubles in the
third quarter, Gazprom said. The producer benefited from higher
prices in  Europe , its biggest market by revenue, even as demand
slowed. The company, Russia’s largest by market value, reports
financial results to international standards months after
smaller gas producer OAO Novatek and state-controlled OAO
Rosneft.  Shipments to Europe rose 3.8 percent to 29 billion cubic
meters in the quarter from a year earlier, compared with a 16
percent gain in the first half, according to Gazprom’s quarterly
report based on Russian standards.  Gazprom’s prices for Europe and  Asia  climbed to $411 per
1,000 cubic meters from $313 in the third quarter of 2010,
according to a presentation on the company’s website. Prices in
the former  Soviet Union  rose to $313 per 1,000 cubic meters from
$229, Gazprom said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
