Solarworld AG (SWV) ’s move to seek tariffs
on Chinese imports may erode the progress made by the solar
industry through rising prices,  Suntech Power Holdings Co. (STP)  Chief
Executive Officer Zhengrong Shi told the  Financial Times
Deutschland .  If Solarworld and its allies win a complaint in the U.S.
and a possible second one in  Europe  alleging the Chinese
government is unfairly subsidizing solar-panel production,
Suntech would increasingly focus on markets in  China  and Asia
that don’t have tariffs, Shi told the newspaper.  Shi declined to predict if Suntech, the biggest producer of
solar panels, will make a profit this year, the FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
