Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR) ,
the maker of Keurig brand single-cup pods and brewers, rose the
most in more than 10 months after reporting profit that beat
analysts’ estimates as sales rose.  Green Mountain advanced 24 percent to $66.42 at the close
in  New York , the most since March 10, after yesterday reporting
profit, excluding some items, of 60 cents a share. Analysts
projected 36 cents, the average of 12 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Blanford has sought to
draw customers by bolstering its K-Cup portfolio with  Starbucks
Corp. (SBUX)  and Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. products. Seattle-based
Starbucks, which sells K-Cups in grocery and mass retail stores,
 said  last month that annual pod sales may grow to $1 billion.  “We’re definitely following, to a degree, the Gillette
razor, razor-blade model,” Blanford said in a telephone
interview yesterday.  Green Mountain  sells its brewers near cost
and makes money through K-Cup sales, he said.  K-Cup sales more than doubled to $715.7 million, while
brewer sales rose 76 percent to $330.4 million in the quarter,
according to the statement. The company sold 4.2 million brewers
during the quarter, compared with 2.2 million a year ago.  Net income  in the three months ended Dec. 24 rose to $104.4
million, or 66 cents a share, from $2.41 million, or 2 cents, a
year earlier, the Waterbury, Vermont-based company said
yesterday in a statement.  Sales Growth  Revenue more than doubled to $1.16 billion, the company’s
13th straight quarter of sales growth exceeding 50 percent.
Analysts projected $1.06 billion, the average of  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg.  Green Mountain said inventories more than doubled to $606.7
million in the quarter, from $269.1 million a year earlier.  The company said second-quarter profit, excluding certain
items, will be 60 cents to 65 cents a share, compared with an
average analyst estimate of 73 cents. Green Mountain reiterated
its fiscal 2012 profit forecast, excluding some items, for as
much as $2.65 a share. The average estimate of analysts was
$2.55.  The coffee company has faced criticism from hedge fund
manager  David Einhorn  that its market-share gains have peaked
amid what he calls “a litany of accounting questions.”  Along with Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts, K-Cup portion pack
brands include  Caribou Coffee Co. (CBOU) , Millstone, Gloria Jean’s and
Folgers.  Green Mountain is also working with Luigi Lavazza SpA to
develop an espresso machine to compete with Nestle SA’s
Nespresso coffee brewers. Lavazza, based in  Italy , owned 5.5
percent of Green Mountain shares as of May 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
