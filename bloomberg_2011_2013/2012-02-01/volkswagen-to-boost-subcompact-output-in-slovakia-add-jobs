Volkswagen AG (VOW) ,  Europe ’s largest
carmaker, said it will increase production of subcompact models
at its Slovak factory.  The carmaker’s factory in the Slovak capital Bratislava
will from April 16 produce Volkswagen up!, Seat Mii and Skoda
Citigo models in three shifts, unit spokesman Vladimir Machalik
said in an e-mailed statement today. The boost will add 650 jobs
to the current workforce of around 7,000, he said.  The factory, which also makes sport-utility vehicles, plans
to produce around 400,000 cars this year after adding the
subcompact models, collectively referred to as the New Small
Family line, last year. In 2010, the unit shipped 144,510 cars
with SUVs accounting for more than 90 percent of the total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
