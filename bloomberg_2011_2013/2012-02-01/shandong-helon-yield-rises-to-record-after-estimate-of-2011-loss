The yield on  Shandong Helon Co. (000677) ’s
bond rose by more than 2,000 basis points in January to a record
after the Chinese maker of chemical fiber said it may report a
net loss for last year.  The company’s 400 million yuan of one-year debt closed
yesterday with a yield of 30.2 percent, according to data from
Chinabond, the nation’s bond clearinghouse. One-year commercial
paper and medium-term notes with an A- rating, the lowest-rated
index available, yields 9.78 percent according to  Chinabond. (CNMPG1) 
China Lianhe Credit Rating Co. lowered its rating on Shandong
Helon’s bond to a non-investment grade BB+ in December. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  Shandong Helon, whose debt matures in April, said this week
it expects to post a net loss of 1 billion yuan ($159 million)
for last year after having said earlier last month that it had
397 million yuan overdue with banks, accounting for 119 percent
of the company’s net assets as of its latest audit. No company
in  China  has defaulted on publicly traded domestic debt since
the country’s central bank started regulating the market in 1997,
according to Moody’s Investors Service.  Shares of Shandong Helon have been suspended the company
said in an Aug. 22 statement it had discovered a matter that may
have a “relatively large” impact on its stock price and which
hadn’t been disclosed. Its shares will be suspended until a
statement is issued on the matter, the company said then.  The company, based in the city of Weifang in eastern
China’s Shandong province, cited macroeconomic conditions for
its estimated 2011 loss. Shandong Helon posted a loss of 408
million yuan for 2010, according to a filing to Shenzhen’s stock
exchange.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
