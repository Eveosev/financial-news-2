Concerns over  liquidity risk  posed by
 MF Global Holdings Ltd (MFGLQ) .’s European debt positions in October
2010 were deemed “implausible” by then-Chief Executive Officer
Jon S. Corzine, according to his former top risk officer.  “I discussed my concerns about the positions and the risk
scenarios with Mr. Corzine and others,” Michael Roseman, MF
Global’s chief risk officer until January 2011, said in
testimony prepared for a House hearing tomorrow. “The risk
scenarios I presented were challenged as being implausible.”  Roseman laid out his concerns when he was asked to make a
presentation to MF Global’s board on a request to increase the
total sovereign debt limit to $4.75 billion, he said in his
remarks, which were prepared for a Financial Services
investigations subcommittee hearing on the firm’s risk
management practices.  MF Global filed for the eighth-biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history on Oct. 31 after receiving margin calls and other
demands for money amid escalating concern that the brokerage
wouldn’t have enough capital to cover its European bets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
