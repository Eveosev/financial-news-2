Two U.S. senators introduced a
measure today to cut any unpaid bonus money to executives of
government-backed  Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and  Freddie Mac (FMCC)  and put employees
of the mortgage-finance firms onto a federal pay scale.  Senators Mark Begich, an Alaska Democrat, and John Thune, a
South Dakota Republican, introduced the measure in the wake of
disclosures last year that the Federal Housing Finance Agency
approved nearly $13 million in compensation for executives at
the two firms. The House Financial Services Committee approved a
similar bill in November.  Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  have cost U.S. taxpayers more
than $150 billion in aid since 2008, when they were taken into
conservatorship as they teetered on the brink of collapse after
investing in risky mortgages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
