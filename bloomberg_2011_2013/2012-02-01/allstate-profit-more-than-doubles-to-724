Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the largest publicly
traded U.S. auto and home insurer, said fourth-quarter profit
more than doubled on lower costs tied to catastrophes. The
company advanced in extended trading.  Net income rose to $724 million, or $1.43 a share, from
$296 million, or 55 cents, a year earlier, the Northbrook,
Illinois-based insurer said today in a statement. Operating
income, which excludes some investment results, was $1.48 a
share, beating the 96-cent  average estimate  of 23 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Insurers benefited from milder weather in the U.S. in the
last three months of 2011 after facing $21.3 billion in costs
from U.S. storms in the second quarter and more than $4 billion
from  Hurricane Irene  in the third, according to the  Insurance
Information Institute . Allstate Chief Executive Officer  Thomas Wilson , 54, is raising rates and said in December that the
homeowners’ business hasn’t generated acceptable returns for
“some time.”  “You didn’t have a lot of really nasty weather during the
fourth quarter,” Paul Newsome, an analyst at Sandler O’Neill &
Partners LP who advises clients to buy the stock, said before
the results were announced. Allstate has struggled with claims
costs, “so they could use a little good luck,” he said.  The insurer climbed 2.4 percent to $30.01 at 4:17 p.m. in
 New York . The company had lost 7.2 percent in the 12 months
through today’s close, compared with the 10 percent drop in the
24-company KBW Insurance Index.  Catastrophe Costs  Catastrophe costs in the fourth quarter fell to $66 million
from $537 million a year earlier, when the insurer faced claims
from an Arizona hailstorm. Allstate made 9.3 cents for every
premium dollar in its property-and-liability coverage unit
compared with a loss of 0.8 cents a year earlier.  Full-year net income fell to $788 million, the lowest for
the insurer since 2008, when writedowns contributed to an annual
loss of $1.68 billion. That compares with a profit of $928
million in 2010. Property-casualty insurers including Travelers
Cos. and Chubb Corp. posted lower profit in 2011 tied to losses
from natural disasters.  Book value , a measure of assets minus liabilities, advanced
to $36.92 a share from $35.56 at the end of September.  Auto Insurance  Allstate has been losing auto-insurance customers as
drivers buy coverage on the Internet rather than from agents.
The insurer completed its acquisition of online car insurance
seller Esurance from  White Mountains Insurance Group Ltd. (WTM)  in
October to compete with growing direct-to-consumer carriers such
as Progressive Corp. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s Geico unit.  Buying Esurance and online agency Answer Financial from
White Mountains for $1 billion was more cost-effective than
building a direct business, Wilson said when the deal was
announced in May.  Travel fell 0.9 percent to 240.9 billion miles in November
from the same month in 2010, according to the  Federal Highway
Administration . Fewer miles driven may lead to a lower frequency
of car accidents and insurance claims.  To contact the reporter on this story:
