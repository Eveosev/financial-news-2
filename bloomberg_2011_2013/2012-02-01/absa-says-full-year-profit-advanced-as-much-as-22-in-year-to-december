Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) , the South African
bank controlled by Barclays Plc, said full-year profit climbed
as much as 22 percent, exceeding estimates.  Earnings per share excluding one-time items for the year
through December probably rose 18 percent to 22 percent from
11.22 rand a year earlier, the Johannesburg-based lender said in
a statement today. An 18 percent advance in earnings would be
13.247 rand and compares with a 13.199-rand  average estimate  of
18 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The lender should boost non-interest revenue 12 percent in
the year through December, driven by fee and income commission
growth, UBS AG, which has a “buy” recommendation on the stock,
wrote in a Jan. 11 report. Absa could raise its payout to
shareholders, with a special dividend expected in the second
half of fiscal 2012, UBS said.  Absa shares have risen 9.8 percent in the past 12 months,
compared with a 10 percent gain in the six-member  FTSE/JSE
Africa Banks Index (JBNKS) . The stock carries nine “buy,” eight
“hold” and one “sell”  recommendation .  To contact the reporter on this story:
