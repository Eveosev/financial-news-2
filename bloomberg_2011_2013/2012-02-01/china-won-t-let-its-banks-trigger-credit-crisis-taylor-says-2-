China ’s government won’t allow the
nation’s banks to trigger another credit crisis, said Joseph Taylor, an emerging-markets strategist at Boston-based Loomis,
Sayles & Co., which oversees $163 billion in assets.  “Banks are still the instrumentality of the state,”
Taylor said at the Bloomberg Link China Conference in New York
today. “They won’t be allowed to go under. They won’t be
allowed to trigger a systemic crisis.”  While the economy won’t get to crisis point, growth will
probably slow because China has had “almost no success” in
increasing consumption as a percentage of gross domestic
product, and the nation has too much bad debt, Taylor said.  “The credit expansion can continue to the same degree
because of the increasing leverage in the system,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
