Take off your shoes, put on white
booties and step into a milky void at  David Zwirner  gallery.  The immersive light installation by  Los Angeles  and Santa
Fe-based artist  Doug Wheeler  is the most unusual experience of
New York’s gallery scene at the moment.  Walking in, it’s impossible to tell the dimensions or the
depth of the space. It feels infinite and appears to be filled
with fog, but as you look around, there’s no mist obscuring a
handful of other visitors. The light is so intense that strange
little shapes start floating in front of your eyes.  Within about 30 minutes, Wheeler shifts the light ever so
slightly from dawn to dusk. When your eyes adjust a bit, try
stepping back to discern the concave walls and ceiling line. The
sense of disorientation returns each time you move inside again.  As the shadows grew long and the light got tinted with gray
and purple, it felt like the end.  The exhibition runs through Feb. 25 at 519 W. 19th St.; +1-

Pictures gallery, five blocks north, mundane objects are turned
into art.  The first thing you see is a small, life-size maple tree
and a huge rock. Both are artificial, made with materials
including foam board, plywood and concrete.  Black-and-white prints, depicting generic, graffiti-sprayed
housing complexes, line the walls like wallpaper. In the second
room, filing cabinets are scattered around, one painted glittery
magenta. On the floor, the carpets spell out “NO.”  The pointlessness and emptiness of this constructed
environment is heightened by the continuous presence of two
young women, whose job it is to sit around, read and draw as the
time ticks away.  Prices range from $2,500 to $70,000. The show runs through
March 10 at 519 W. 24th St.; +1-212-206-7100;
 http://www.metropicturesgallery.com   Squiggles  Jean Dubuffet’s late paintings at the Pace Gallery, one
block uptown, pulsate with manic energy, squiggles, colors.  The artist (1901-1985) leaves no empty space and the
movement of his hand feels relentless as he piles on the marks.  The works were made in the last two years of the French
painter’s life.  The rawness and intensity of these abstract compositions
recall Dubuffet’s earlier primitivism. Some pieces look as if
they were fragments of larger works.  Prices range from $250,000 to $400,000. “Jean Dubuffet:
The Last Two Years” runs through March 10 at 510 W. 25th St.;
