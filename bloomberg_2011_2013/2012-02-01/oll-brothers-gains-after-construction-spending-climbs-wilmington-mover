Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL) , the largest U.S.
luxury-home builder, rose after construction spending increased
and a Barclays Capital economist said the housing market is
stabilizing.  The Horsham, Pennsylvania-based company climbed 3 percent
to $22.46 at the close of New York trading.  Construction spending in the U.S. rose 1.5 percent in
December, Commerce Department figures showed today. That was
more than the median analyst estimate of a 0.5 percent gain. The
increase, which included a 0.8 percent gain in home
construction, was the biggest jump since August.  “The report continues to suggest that the residential
housing sector is stabilizing and making an effort to start
improving,” Troy Davig, a senior U.S. economist at Barclays,
said in a note today.  Toll Brothers in December reported earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates as prices rose and sales improved at its
East Coast subdivisions. Chief Executive Officer Douglas Yearley Jr. said in an interview last month that the company expects  New
York City  to be its strongest housing market this year.  Nationwide, Toll expects to sell “not that much more”
than 2,600 homes in 2012, according to Yearley. The company sold
2,611 homes in fiscal 2011, according to its Dec. 6 earnings
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
