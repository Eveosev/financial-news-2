Peru’s sol rose to a three-year high
as signs global manufacturing is strengthening boosted demand
for higher-yielding, emerging market assets.  The sol ended the day little changed at 2.6895 per  U.S.
dollar , from 2.6890 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s
local unit. The currency earlier touched 2.6885, its strongest
since at least December 2008.  U.S. manufacturing grew at the fastest pace since June, the
U.K.’s factory measure unexpectedly reached an eight-month high
and manufacturing gauges in Europe,  China  and  India  increased in
January.  “The data generated optimism that the crisis in the euro-
zone isn’t going to spread and that the U.S. and emerging
markets are going to keep growing regardless of what happens in
Europe,” said  Roberto Flores , head of research at Lima-based
brokerage Inteligo SAB.  The country’s central bank  bought  the most dollars in two
months to temper gains in the sol. It purchased $293 million and
paid an average 2.6889 soles per dollar, the bank said in a
statement on its website.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 5.67 percent, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price climbed 0.17 centimo to
114.46 centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
