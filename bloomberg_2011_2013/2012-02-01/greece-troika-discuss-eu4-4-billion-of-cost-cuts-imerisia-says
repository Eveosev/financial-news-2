Greece  plans 4.4 billion euros ($5.8
billion) of spending cuts this year as part of the terms of a
second financing agreement being discussed with European Union
and International Monetary Fund officials,  Imerisia  reported.  The cuts, amounting to about 2 percent of gross domestic
product, will be in defense, health-care and pharmaceutical
spending and state-run companies will also be affected, the
Athens-based newspaper said, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
