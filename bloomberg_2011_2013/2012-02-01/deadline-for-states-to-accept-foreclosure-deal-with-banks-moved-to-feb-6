The deadline for states to decide
whether to join a proposed nationwide foreclosure settlement
with banks was delayed to Feb. 6 from Feb. 3, the Iowa Attorney
General’s Office said.  States were given more time to evaluate the proposal, which
may total $25 billion, after at least one asked for a delay,
Geoff Greenwood, a spokesman for Iowa Attorney General  Tom Miller , said yesterday in a phone interview. Miller is helping
to lead negotiations.  State and federal officials have been negotiating an
agreement with mortgage servicers that would provide mortgage
relief to homeowners and set requirements for how banks conduct
foreclosures.  State officials are reviewing the agreement with  Bank of
America Corp. ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co .,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Wells Fargo
& Co. (WFC)  and  Ally Financial Inc (ALLY) ., and are being asked to sign on.
Greenwood declined to name the state that asked for more time or
comment on state support for the deal.  Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said in a
Jan. 27 letter to Miller, the  Justice Department  and U.S.
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan that she
needed answers to 38 questions to evaluate the deal.  The deadline was changed as Oregon Attorney General John Kroger said today in a statement that he would sign on to the
settlement, joining Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen,
who also supports it.  Delaware Attorney General  Beau Biden  has said he won’t sign
on to the settlement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
