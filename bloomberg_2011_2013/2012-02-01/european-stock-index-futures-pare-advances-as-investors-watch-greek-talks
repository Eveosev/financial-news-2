European (SXXP)  stocks advanced to a six-
month high, with the Stoxx Europe 600 Index extending its best
start to a year since 1998, as gauges of manufacturing increased
from America to the euro area to  China .  Banks and carmakers led  gains .  ICAP Plc (IAP)  jumped 7.7 percent
after saying annual pretax profit will be at the “upper end”
of the range of analysts’ estimates.  RWE AG (RWE)  climbed 4.9 percent
after Morgan Stanley added the stock to its best ideas list.  The  Stoxx 600  rose 2 percent to 259.51 at the close in
 London , its highest level since August. The benchmark gauge
rallied 4 percent last month, the biggest January gain since
1998, as the  U.S. economy  maintained its recovery and
speculation grew that  European (SXXP)  policy makers will contain the
region’s debt crisis.  “U.S. manufacturing data is key,” said Guillaume Duchesne, an equity strategist at BGL BNP Paribas SA in
Luxembourg. “Industrial activity is doing well. Jobs data at
the end of the week will be important. As long as there are good
economic surprises, that will support stocks.”  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. manufacturing
 index  rose to 54.1 in January from 53.1 in December, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group’s data showed today. Fifty is the dividing
line between growth and contraction, and the median forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey called for an increase to 54.5.  China, Euro Area  Chinese manufacturing rose last month as the world’s
second-biggest economy withstood weaker exports driven by the
euro-area debt crisis and a government-induced property
slowdown. The official purchasing managers’ index increased to
50.5 in January from 50.3 in December, exceeding the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey for a reading below 50.  In the euro area, a gauge of manufacturing beat estimates
in the first month of 2012. The Markit Economics final
purchasing managers’ index rose to 48.8 from 46.9 in the prior
month. That surpassed a forecast for 48.7 by 27 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  A  U.K. (PMITMUK)  manufacturing index jumped to an eight-month high in
January and unexpectedly returned to growth after a quarter of
contraction as production rebounded.  National benchmark indexes rose in 17 of the 18 western
European markets.  France ’s CAC 40 added 2.1 percent. The U.K.’s
FTSE 100 climbed 1.9 percent and  Germany ’s DAX jumped 2.4
percent.  Sweeter Greek Deal  Greek bondholders may get a sweetener tied to a revival in
economic growth that would ease the impact of accepting a lower
 interest rate  on new bonds, people with knowledge of the talks
said.  Three out of 5 European companies on record are missing
profit estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Siemens AG (SIE)  and Ericsson AB are among the 59 percent of
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index companies reporting earnings that fell
short of forecasts during the current quarter, the data show.
That’s the worst ratio since Bloomberg started collating
estimates in 2006, with 39 percent of companies missing
projections in an average quarter.  Bank shares rose 3.8 percent for the  best performance  on
the Stoxx 600. Banco Santander SA,  Spain ’s biggest lender,
advanced 3.6 percent to 6.16 euros. Santander remains Nomura’s
preferred Spanish bank, analysts wrote in a note. Nomura
maintained its “underweight” position on the country’s
lenders.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , France’s third-largest bank,
rallied 7.4 percent to 5.06 euros.  RWE, Fortum  RWE (RWE) , Germany’s second-largest utility, added 4.9 percent to
30.68 euros. Morgan Stanley added the shares to its best ideas
list, saying the company has a more focused disposal program.  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V) ,  Finland ’s biggest utility, gained 6.8 percent
to 17.94 euros. The company reported fourth-quarter net income
of 421 million euros ($550 million), surpassing analyst
estimates of 339 million euros.  BP Plc, Europe’s second-biggest oil company, gained 2.6
percent to 483 pence.  ICAP jumped 7.7 percent to 362 pence. The world’s  largest
broker  of inter-bank transactions said pretax profit for the
year ending March 31 will be at the “upper end” of the current
range of analyst estimates of 336 million pounds ($528 million)
to 358 million pounds. ICAP had said in November it expected
full-year profit to be within analysts’ projections at that time
of 358 million pounds to 390 million pounds.  Infineon, Yara  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  advanced 5.6 percent to 7.37 euros
after its operating profit fell less than analysts’ projections.
 Profit (IFX)  in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31 was 20 percent
lower at 141 million euros compared to 177 million euros a year
ago, as sales rose 2.6 percent to 946 million euros. Twelve
analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected an average operating
profit of 127 million euros and sales of 934 million euros.  Yara International ASA (YAR)  gained 4.4 percent to 246.50 kroner.
The company bought 16 percent of Burrup Holdings Ltd. for $143
million, increasing its stake to 51 percent. Apache Energy has
signed a deal with Yara for 49 percent of the company, Yara
said.  Renault SA (RNO)  jumped 4.9 percent to 34.18 euros. Renault-
Nissan 2011 global sales rose 10 percent to a record, driven by
 emerging markets  and the U.S., the company said.  Sandvik AB (SAND)  lost 0.6 percent to 99.90 kronor after falling
as much as 6.3 percent earlier today. The world’s biggest maker
of metal-cutting tools reported fourth-quarter  profit  that
missed analysts’ estimates as the company booked costs related
to job cuts.  Net income fell to 731 million kronor ($107 million) from
2.09 billion kronor a year earlier, the company said. Ten
analysts on average had estimated profit of 1.19 billion kronor
in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
