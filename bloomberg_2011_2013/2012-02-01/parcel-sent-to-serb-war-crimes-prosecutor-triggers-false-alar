A parcel sent from the Netherlands to
 Serbia ’s war crimes prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic, initially
suspected to contain an explosive device, was not a threat and
contained only books, a spokesman for the prosecutor’s office
said.  An anti-terrorist unit of the Serbian police was called to
the prosecutor’s home when the parcel was delivered, spokesman
Bruno Vekaric said in a phone interview. Vukcevic is one of
Serbia’s key officials for cooperation with the Netherlands-
based war crimes tribunal for the former  Yugoslavia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
