The  Arab League  will hold its annual
summit on March 29 in  Baghdad , Ahmed Ben Helli, the bloc’s
deputy secretary-general, said.  Arab foreign ministers will gather a day before in the
Iraqi capital, he told a news conference in Baghdad today. Arab
economy ministers will meet in Baghdad on March 27, he said.  “Arab leaders will attend at the highest levels because
all Arab countries want the success of this summit in the face
of challenges confronting the Arab nation,” he said.  The Arab League postponed its annual 2011 summit to this
year after the region was engulfed in a wave of popular protests
that ousted longstanding leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and  Libya ,
and sparked unrest in other countries, including Syria, Yemen
and Bahrain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
