Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) , the world’s biggest
maker of mobile-phone chips, rose to a 12-year high after the
company increased sales and profit targets for the quarter and
year on growing demand for smartphones.  Qualcomm  gained  2 percent to $60.73 at the close of trading
in  New York , the  highest  since the tech bubble burst more than a
decade ago. The stock has risen 11 percent this year.  The company lifted its forecasts for phone shipments based
on strength in India and  China , and said smartphone demand is
boosting chip sales and licensing income. San Diego-based
Qualcomm owns code division multiple access technology, or CDMA,
and can levy royalties on all 3G phones and networks, providing
most of its profit. It is also the largest seller of chips that
connect phones to mobile networks.  “They continue to execute as well as they ever have, which
has always been excellent,” said James Faucette, an analyst at
Pacific Crest Securities LLC in  Portland ,  Oregon , who recommends
the stock. “They’re now at a size and scale that is hard to
disrupt competitively.”  Sales for the second quarter ending in March will increase
to $4.6 billion to $5 billion, the company said in a statement
yesterday. Analysts project $4.51 billion, the average of 31
 estimates  in a Bloomberg survey.  Full-Year Forecast  The company, with  customers  that include Samsung
Electronics Co. and Apple Inc., also supplies applications
processors, chips that run programs in mobile phones, and is
trying to sell bulked-up versions for use in larger machines
such as personal computers.  Qualcomm said sales for the fiscal year will rise 25
percent to 32 percent to a range of $18.7 billion to $19.7
billion. Earnings per share will climb to $3.36 to $3.56, the
company said. Qualcomm had  previously predicted  revenue of $18
billion to $19 billion and profit of $2.80 to $3 a share.  Analysts had estimated earnings of $2.97 on sales of $18.47
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “You’re looking at strength across the board,” Chief
Operating Officer Steve Mollenkopf said in an interview. “We’re
really taking advantage of strong smartphone growth.”  The average selling price of phones in the fiscal second
quarter, used to calculate licensing revenue, will be $204 to
$216, up from an earlier prediction of $197 to $209 per device,
the company said.  Qualcomm said fiscal first-quarter net income rose to $1.4
billion, or 81 cents a share, from $1.17 billion, or 71 cents, a
year earlier. Revenue climbed 40 percent to $4.68 billion in the
period, which ended Dec. 31. Analysts on average projected
profit of 75 cents and sales of $4.58 billion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
