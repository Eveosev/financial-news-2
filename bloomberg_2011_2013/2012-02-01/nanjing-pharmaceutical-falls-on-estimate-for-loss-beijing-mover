Nanjing Pharmaceutical Co. (600713) , a Chinese
distributor and producer of medicines, fell to a two-week low in
Shanghai trading after the company said it expected to report a
loss for 2011.  The stock fell as much as 6.8 percent to 3.70 yuan and
traded at  3.89 yuan  as of the 11:30 a.m. mid-day trading break.
 China ’s benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.4 percent  Nanjing Pharmaceutical said it would post a 2011 net loss
because of higher interest rates on loans and after the results
of some of its business adjustments failed to meet expectations.
The company, the biggest drug distributor in the provinces of
Jiangsu, Anhui and Fujian, is an “ideal acquisition target”,
Capital Securities Corp. said in a report last month.  China’s central bank raised  interest rates  three times last
year to rein in  inflation  that peaked at a three-year high in
July. As a result, the People’s Bank of China’s benchmark one-
year lending rate increased by 75 basis points in 2011.  At the end of the third quarter, Nanjing Pharmaceutical had
2.44 billion yuan ($387 million) of outstanding loans. Its
financing costs for the first nine months of last year increased
48 percent from a year earlier to 143 million yuan, according to
the company’s quarterly earnings report.  Profit for the first nine months fell 113 percent. For the
