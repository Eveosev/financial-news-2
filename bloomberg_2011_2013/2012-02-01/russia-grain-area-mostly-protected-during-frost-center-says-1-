Russia ’s grain areas in the south
mostly have enough snow to protect against damage from frosts,
the Federal Hydrometeorological Center said.  Snow was 35 centimeters (14 inches) deep in the European
part of Russia for the last 10 days of January, Anna
Strashnaya, head of the agricultural-forecasts department at the
center, said by phone in Moscow today. Lows were minus 27
degrees Celsius (minus 17 degrees Fahrenheit) at the end of the
month, data from the center show.  Minimal snow left open potential for damage in parts of the
Rostov region and in central parts of the Krasnodar region, both
in the south, she said. Temperatures closer to the plant under
the snow last month dropped to minus 12 degrees Celsius in those
regions, she said.  “There is no catastrophe,” Strashnaya said. “Frosts are
weakening and we don’t expect that negative factors will
strengthen.” The center will be able to provide estimates of
any crop damage after Feb. 20, she said.  There is a 50 percent chance of drought, she said. Grain
Union President Arkady Zlochevsky said yesterday “high
atmospheric pressure” in January may cause drought in Russia in
spring or summer. Strashnaya said there isn’t a strong
connection between high air pressure in winter and drought.  To contact the reporter on this story:
