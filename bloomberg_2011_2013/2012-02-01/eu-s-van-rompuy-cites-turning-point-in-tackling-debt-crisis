European Union President  Herman Van Rompuy  said the bloc has reached a “ turning point ” in tackling
the two-year-old debt crisis and urged further fiscal austerity
to bolster investors’ confidence in the region.  Van Rompuy said “substantially” lower yields on Italian
and Spanish bonds relative to benchmark German debt compared
with several months ago signal that the euro area’s strategy for
overcoming the Greece-triggered troubles and preserving the euro
is paying off. He also referred to lower Irish yields.  “There is a positive reversal,” he told the European
Parliament today in Brussels. “Is there a turning point? Yes.
And I hope that we can continue along that line.”  European leaders agreed on Jan. 30 to speed the setup of a
full-time 500 billion-euro ($660 billion) rescue fund for
distressed euro-area governments, signed off on a German-
inspired treaty to control budget deficits and pledged again to
offer more aid to  Greece  provided it completes talks on a debt
writedown by investors and deepens spending cuts.  “The most important thing that we can do -- and everyone
agrees on this -- is for there to be a restoration of
confidence,” Van Rompuy said. “When confidence comes back to
the  euro zone , the consumers and our companies will have
confidence themselves and that will lead us inevitably to more
economic growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
