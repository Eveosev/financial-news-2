Ex- Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  workers
will be charged with intentionally mismarking prices of
collateralized debt obligations and other securities, a person
familiar with the matter said.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was also
involved in the probe, said the person, who didn’t want to be
named because the investigation isn’t public. Fewer than five
people will be charged and Credit Suisse won’t be prosecuted,
the person said.  Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S.
Attorney  Preet Bharara , declined to comment yesterday on whether
any charges would be filed.  John Nester , an SEC spokesman, and
Victoria Harmon, a Credit Suisse spokeswoman, also declined to
comment.  On Feb. 19, 2008, Switzerland’s second-largest bank made a
surprise announcement that it would take writedowns on asset-
backed securities after finding “mismarkings” by a group of
traders. The Zurich-based bank said a month later it would write
down $2.65 billion after an internal review found the pricing
errors on residential mortgage-backed bonds and collateralized
debt obligations were made intentionally “by a small number”
of traders who were then fired or suspended.  At the time the pricing errors were found, the Swiss bank
hadn’t disclosed the names of the traders responsible.  The planned filing of charges against the former employees
was reported earlier by Reuters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
