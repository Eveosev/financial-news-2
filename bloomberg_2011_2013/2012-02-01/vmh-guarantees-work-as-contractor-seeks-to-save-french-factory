LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) ,
the world’s largest maker of luxury goods, offered to guarantee
“several years” of work to a French factory to aid a
supplier’s attempt to keep the plant open.  Sofama, based in Auvergne, France, is seeking to take over
the Lejaby leather-goods factory in Yssingeaux, LVMH said today
in a statement. French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said in a
televised interview Jan. 29 that he would find a way of saving
the facility, promising to keep high-skilled workers in France.  “We are proud today to facilitate the rescue of jobs at
the Yssingeaux site and to contribute to the battle for
employment in France,” LVMH Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Bernard Arnault said in today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
