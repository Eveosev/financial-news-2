Russian manufacturing growth slowed
for a second month in January as new export orders tumbled at
the fastest rate since July, HSBC Holdings Plc said.  The HSBC Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 50.8 from 51.6
in December, HSBC said in an e-mailed statement today, citing
data compiled by London-based Markit Economics. A level above 50
signals an expansion, while below that shows a contraction.  Russian industrial production slowed more than forecast
last month to the lowest level since 2009 after companies scaled
back output because of concern  Europe ’s debt crisis would hurt
demand. Manufacturing growth slowed to 6.1 percent last year
from 8.3 percent in 2010, the Federal Statistics Service said
yesterday.  “While new domestic orders appeared to continue growing
moderately, the decline in new export orders intensified,” said
 Alexander Morozov , chief economist for Russia, Ukraine and
 Kazakhstan  at HSBC in Moscow, in the statement. “As a lead
indicator, the latter points to a rather weak outlook for the
sector. Yet ‘weak’ does not mean ‘bad.’”  To contact the reporters on this story:
