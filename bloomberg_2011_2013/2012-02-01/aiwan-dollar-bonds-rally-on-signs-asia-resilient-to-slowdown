Taiwan ’s dollar reversed earlier
gains on concern economic growth will falter after the island
reported the slowest expansion in two years. Bonds gained.  Taiwan’s gross domestic product increased 1.9 percent in
the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in more
than two years, and contracted from the previous three months,
the statistics bureau reported yesterday. The local dollar also
weakened after the greenback’s 14-day relative-strength index
dropped to 20 yesterday, below the threshold of 30 that signals
the U.S. currency may rebound. The Taiwan dollar appreciated 2.3
percent in January, the most in nine months.  “Economic growth prospects are still very uncertain,”
said Tarsicio Tong, a currency trader at Union Bank of Taiwan in
Taipei. “The central bank is aware of the recent rallies of the
currency.”  The  Taiwan dollar  weakened 0.3 percent to NT$29.695 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the close, according to Taipei Forex
Inc. That’s the biggest decline since Dec. 15. The currency
touched NT$29.500 earlier, the strongest level since Sept. 14.  The government sold NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of two-year
bonds at 0.78 percent today, compared with the median estimate
of 0.8 percent in a Bloomberg News survey.  The yield on the government’s 1 percent notes due January
