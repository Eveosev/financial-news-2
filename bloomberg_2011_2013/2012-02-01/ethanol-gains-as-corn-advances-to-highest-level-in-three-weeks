Ethanol futures gained for a second
day in  Chicago  on concern that production costs will increase
because of higher export demand for corn.  Futures advanced as corn rose to a three-week high, adding
to speculation that distilleries will have to compete with
foreign buyers to secure supply of the grain, which is used to
make ethanol in the U.S. One bushel of corn makes about 2.75
gallons of the biofuel.  “Corn’s been up and that’s helping to support it,” said
Will Babler, a broker at First Capitol Risk Management in
Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for February delivery increased 0.2 cent
to $2.169 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have
fallen 1.5 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago added 2.5 cents,
or 1.2 percent, to $2.18 a gallon. In the U.S. Gulf the additive
climbed 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.265, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the West Coast gained 2 cents, or 0.9 percent,
to $2.295 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel rose 1.5 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $2.285.  Corn futures for March delivery advanced 3 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $6.42 a bushel in Chicago. The settlement was the
highest since Jan. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
