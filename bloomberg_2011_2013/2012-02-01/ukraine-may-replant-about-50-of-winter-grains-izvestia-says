Ukraine may need to replant about
half of its winter grain crop in the spring,  Ekonomicheskie
Izvestia  newspaper reported, citing Tetiana Adamenko, the head
of the national weather center’s agro-meteorology department.  Between 30 percent and 35 percent of winter grain fields
don’t have sufficient snow cover to protect plants from very low
temperatures being seen across the country, the newspaper cited
Adamenko as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
