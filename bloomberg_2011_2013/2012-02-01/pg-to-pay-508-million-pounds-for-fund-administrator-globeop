TPG Capital LLP, the private-equity
firm run by  David Bonderman , agreed to buy  GlobeOp Financial
Services SA (GO/)   for about 508 million pounds ($800 million), adding
a company that maintains financial records for  hedge funds  as
the industry grows.  The firm will pay 435 pence a share in cash, 49 percent
more than the closing price on Jan. 5, the day before GlobeOp
said it was in talks to be acquired, TPG said in a statement
today. London-based GlobeOp said it had started a strategic
review last year to determine whether shareholders would benefit
from the sale of the company.  “The independent directors believe that the offer
represents good value and an attractive balance between the
future opportunities and risks facing the business, and have
therefore decided to recommend TPG’s offer to shareholders,”
GlobeOp Chairman Ed Nicoll said in the statement.  GlobeOp, which calculates funds’ management and performance
fees, and determines monthly net asset values, has increased the
amount of hedge fund assets it does administrative work for by
about 16 percent to $173 billion over the past year. While 2011
was the hedge fund industry’s second worst year ever in terms of
 investment performance , money managers still opened more than
1,100 new firms, according to data provider Eurekahedge Pte.  GlobeOp shares rose 21.9 percent to 432.75 pence as of
11:15 a.m. in London trading.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.  advised  Fort Worth , Texas-based TPG on
the deal, according to the statement. GlopeOp, which was started
in Luxembourg and has offices in London and  New York , was
advised by Evercore Partners.  TPG is currently investing a $19.8 billion global buyout
fund. Recent investments in Europe include the purchase in
August of a 30 percent stake in Denmark’s Saxo Bank A/S.  GlopeOp said in a Jan. 6 statement that it was holding
discussions on a sale with TPG and Advent International Corp., a
Boston-based private-equity firm. GlobeOp at the time said the
negotiations were at a “preliminary stage” and that the board
believed the company’s share price “significantly” undervalued
growth prospects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
