Credicorp Ltd. (BAP)  rose the most in two
months as investors bet that  Peru ’s largest financial-services
provider will report profit that beats analysts’ estimates.  Credicorp climbed 3 percent to $117.06 at 2:20 p.m. in Lima
and gained as much as 4.5 percent, the steepest intraday rise
since Nov. 30.  “It’s speculation the company’s going to post better
results than people were expecting,” said Leoncio Altamirano, a
trader at Lima-based brokerage Juan Magot y Asociados SAB.
“Peru hasn’t really felt the effects of the global crisis. The
shares probably will keep gaining to about $120.”  Credicorp probably had fourth-quarter profit per share
excluding items of $2.11, up from $1.65 a year earlier,
according to the average estimate of six analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Results are scheduled for release tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
