Warner Music  Group, an unsuccessful
bidder for EMI Group, will lobby in the U.S. and Europe against
the sale of the company to competitor Universal Music Group,
retiring Chairman Edgar Bronfman Jr. said.  “It’s extreme hubris that Universal Music even believes it
can acquire EMI,” Bronfman said today at an All Things D
conference in Dana Point, California.  Vivendi SA (VIV) ’s Universal Music, the biggest record company
worldwide, would be a dangerous competitor if it’s allowed to
buy EMI, Bronfman said. Universal Music’s market share, combined
with EMI’s, would allow the company to set terms with artists
and consumers, he said.  Citigroup Inc., which took control of London-based EMI
after the company fell out of compliance with debt covenants, is
selling the recorded music business to Universal and the
publishing operation to a group led by  Sony Corp. (6758)  The deal
requires regulatory approval.  Peter Lofrumento, a spokesman for Universal Music, didn’t
immediately respond to messages seeking comment.  Bronfman said in December he would step down as chairman of
New York-based Warner Music, effective today. Warner Music was
acquired by billionaire Len Blavatnik in July for $1.3 billion
plus assumed debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
