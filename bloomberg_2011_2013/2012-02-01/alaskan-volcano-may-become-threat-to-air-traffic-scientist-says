Scientists are watching Alaska’s
Mount Cleveland on the Aleutian Islands because it may become a
threat to air traffic, said John Power, scientist in charge at
the  Alaska Volcano Observatory .  Mount Cleveland, about 5,600 feet high, has exploded almost
every year since 2005 and was particularly active in the last
half of 2011, Power said. Its last blast was five weeks ago.  Earlier this week, scientists detected a new lava dome
forming at the top of the mountain, an indication it may explode
again. The Volcano Observatory issued an orange warning, the
second highest on its four-step scale for aviation alerts.  “The explosions have not been going up very high, about
10,000 to 20,000 feet, typically not enough to interfere with
international air traffic,” Power said by telephone from
Anchorage. “If it does go up higher than that, then we could
have real problems.”  Mount Cleveland is about 940 miles southwest of Anchorage
and about 70 miles from the nearest town, Power said. While it
hasn’t produced an  ash cloud  large enough to disrupt  air travel 
in recent history, records indicate it has the potential to do
so. It threw a cloud up to a height of 18,000 feet on Dec. 29,
Power said.  The volcano has had at least 32 active periods since 1828,
Power said. The island is so remote the  U.S. Geological Survey 
uses satellites as the primary tools for monitoring it.  The volcano’s crater is between 100 and 200 meters (328
feet to 656 feet) across and the exact height of the mountain is
hard to calculate because it “changes frequently,” Power said.  Lava domes have been forming and exploding for the past
several months, Power said.  “We just started into a new lava dome growing and who
knows how long that will stay there,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
