The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is
offering a general signup for its Conservation Reserve Program,
its largest land- and water-preservation effort, from March 12
to April 6.  Farmers or ranchers whose land is accepted into the program
receive payments for idling production. Total enrollment in the
program declined 15 percent to  31.1 million  acres in 2011 from a
peak in 2007 as higher crop prices drew more land into
production. The USDA made the announcement today in an e-mailed
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
