The Gulf Cooperation Council urged
the international community to ensure that the  Strait of Hormuz 
stays open to shipping , Arab News  reported, citing Abdullatif al-Zayani, the six-member group’s secretary general.  The route should remain open “at all costs,” the Jeddah-
based newspaper cited al-Zayani as saying.  Iran  has threatened to close the strait, the passage for
about 20 percent of the world’s oil, if sanctions impede the
sale of its oil. The U.S. and the European Union are imposing
new sanctions to put pressure on Iran to abandon any effort to
develop nuclear weapons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
