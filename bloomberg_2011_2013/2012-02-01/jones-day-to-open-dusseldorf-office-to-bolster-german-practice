Jones Day  (1113L), a law firm with more than
2,500 attorneys worldwide, will open a Dusseldorf office as it
seeks to expand its presence in  Germany .  “Our German practice has recently made very significant
progress, in particular in M&A, private equity, antitrust, and
patent litigation,” said Ansgar Rempp, who will serve as
partner in charge of the new office, in a statement. “The
Dusseldorf office will accelerate this development and is a
major step forward for Jones Day towards becoming one of the
leading firms in Germany.”  Rempp, who previously was the head of the firm’s Munich
office, said that Jones Day is pursuing a number of lateral
hirings.  Jones Day, which has more than 70 lawyers in its existing
Munich and Frankfurt offices combined, said the new office will
allow the firm to practice in the Dusseldorf patent infringement
court. The office will also focus on corporate matters, M&A,
private equity and antitrust.  The firm was  ranked  as the seventh-highest-grossing  law
firm  in 2010 by the American Lawyer, a trade magazine, with more
than $1.62 billion in revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
