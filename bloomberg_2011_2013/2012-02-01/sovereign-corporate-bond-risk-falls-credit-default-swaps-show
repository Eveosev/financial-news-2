The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate debt fell to the lowest since August after
a report showed U.S. manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace
in seven months.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
on 50 companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 28
basis points to 590, the lowest since Aug. 8, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. prices at 4:30 p.m. in  London . A decline
signals an improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Growth in production from America to  China  is fueling
optimism that companies will withstand the euro-area sovereign
crisis. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S.  factory index 
rose to 54.1 last month from 53.1 in December, the Tempe,
Arizona-based group’s report showed today.  “The positive trends are there and growing in strength and
keep driving the market forwards,” said Roger Francis, an
analyst at Mizuho Securities Ltd. in London. “However, people
continue to worry because they’ve been burnt so many times
already.”  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 5.75 basis points to 137.5 basis
points, the lowest since Aug. 5, JPMorgan prices show.
Financial-company bond risk also fell, with the Markit iTraxx
Financial Index linked to the senior debt of 25 banks and
insurers declining 8.5 basis points to 210.5 and the
subordinated index was 20 basis points lower at 362.  Sovereign Risk  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell 14 basis points to 325.  European manufacturing shrank less than forecast, data
released today showed, as  Germany  made up for weakness in
countries from  France  to Ireland. A  euro-region factory index 
rose to 48.8 in January, below the 50 threshold that indicates
expansion.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
