Oil declined to a six-week low after
the Energy Department reported U.S. inventories climbed more
than expected and gasoline demand tumbled to a 10-year low.  Futures dropped 0.9 percent after  supplies  rose 4.18
million barrels to 338.9 million last week. A  2.6 million-barrel 
gain was forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Gasoline
consumption slipped to 7.97 million barrels a day.  “The tone is turning bearish,” said Todd Horwitz, chief
strategist at Adam Mesh Trading Group in New York. “We continue
to get bearish reports week after week and the market has been
able to hold on. It looks like that is about to end.”  Crude oil for March delivery fell 87 cents to $97.61 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Dec. 20. The price has increased 7.5 percent in
the past year.  Brent crude oil for March settlement climbed 58 cents, or
0.5 percent, to end the session at $111.56 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The European benchmark
contract’s premium to West Texas Intermediate futures widened to
$13.95, the most since Nov. 11. Brent traded at a record $27.88
more than WTI on Oct. 14.  “If we can move below the $97.50 area there’s nothing
stopping us until $92.50,” Mesh said. The intraday low of
$92.52 on Dec. 16 is the lowest price since Nov. 3.  Gasoline demand declined 1.6 percent to the lowest level
since the week ended Sept. 21, 2001, the report showed. Total
 fuel consumption  dropped 8.3 percent to 17.7 million barrels a
day, the least since 1999.  Gasoline Inventories  Stockpiles (DOESTMGS)  of the motor fuel rose 3.02 million barrels to
230.1 million in the week ended Jan. 27, the highest level since
February, the report showed. A 500,000-barrel gain was
projected, according to the median of 12 analyst estimates in
the Bloomberg News survey.  “We’ve been drifting lower on the negative gasoline
numbers,” said  Tom Bentz , a director with BNP Paribas Prime
Brokerage Inc. in  New York . “There was an early rally on
economic data, but we were unable to sustain it.”  Refineries (DOEPPERC)  operated at 81.8 percent of capacity, down 0.4
percentage point from the week before. It was the lowest
operating rate since May.  Oil advanced earlier after manufacturing indexes from  China 
to the U.S. to Germany increased. Manufacturing in the U.S. grew
in January at the fastest pace in seven months, according to the
Institute for Supply Management. The Tempe, Arizona-based
group’s manufacturing index rose to 54.1 from 53.1 in December.
The  median  forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was
54.5.  Chinese Industry  China’s official  purchasing managers’ index  increased to
50.5 from 50.3 in December, exceeding the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey. A separate gauge from HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics rose to 48.8.  India ’s manufacturing grew at
the fastest pace in eight months.  Germany ’s manufacturing index
rose to 51, according to Markit Economics.  “The PMI numbers are casting a positive light on the
commodity space,” said David McAlvany, chief executive officer
of McAlvany Financial Group in Durango, Colorado. “The data
points to strong growth in both China and India during the first
half of the year. The  U.S. economy  is also doing better, which
is good for demand.”  Companies in the U.S. added 170,000 workers in January,
according to a private report based on payrolls. The increase
followed a revised 292,000 rise the prior month that was smaller
than previously reported, the report from the Roseland, New
Jersey-based ADP Employer Services showed today. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 40 economists called for
an advance of 182,000.  Strike Averted  Oil also climbed earlier after the United Steelworkers
union and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  yesterday averted a potential
strike that would have idled as many as 69 refineries. Other
companies involved include  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ,  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ,  BP Plc (BP/) ,  ConocoPhillips (COP) ,  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ,  Marathon Oil
Corp. (MRO) ,  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) ,  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  and PBF Energy Inc.  Futures touched $103.74 a barrel on Jan. 4, the highest
level since May 11, on concern that rising tension between Iran
and the West would lead to a disruption of shipments from the
 Persian Gulf .  Nuclear talks between senior United Nations officials and
members of Iran’s government progressed enough for both sides to
commit to more negotiations, International Atomic Energy Agency
Chief Inspector Herman Nackaerts told reporters today at Vienna
International Airport after returning from a trip to the nation.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 543,137
contracts as of 3:25 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 739,294 on
yesterday, 27 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.4 million contracts, the most since Nov. 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
