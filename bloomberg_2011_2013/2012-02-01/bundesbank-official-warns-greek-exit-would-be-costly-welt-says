Rudolf Boehmler, a board member of
 Germany ’s Bundesbank, said a Greek exit from the euro would
destabilize financial markets and could be much more expensive
for the other countries that have the common currency than
“current plans,”  Die Welt  reported, citing an interview.  Money alone won’t overcome the difficulties of countries in
crisis in the long term, Boehmler told the newspaper. The
Bundesbank is “convinced” that the euro will survive, Die Welt
cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
