The dollar weakened against most of
its 16 major counterparts as Asian stocks extended a global
rally ahead of U.S. data that may show an improving job market,
curbing demand for refuge assets.  The 17-nation euro held yesterday’s gain versus the
greenback after German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said Europe must
be united in protecting stability in the currency. A gauge of
volatility for the yen climbed to the highest this year amid
speculation  Japan  will intervene in the foreign-exchange market.
 Australia ’s dollar touched a five-month high.  “Risk appetite is fairly positive at the moment, and this
could continue for a couple of weeks,” said Derek Mumford, a
director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a currency-risk
management company. “Typical safe-haven currencies have taken a
step back now.”  The dollar dropped 0.1 percent to $1.3178 per euro as of
6:37 a.m. in  London  from $1.3161 in New York yesterday when it
slid 0.6 percent. The yen was little changed at 100.30 per euro
after losing 0.5 percent yesterday. The Japanese currency traded
at 76.12 per dollar, 1 percent from the record high of 75.35 set
on Oct. 31.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares gained 1.1 percent,
heading for the biggest advance in almost two weeks, after the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  rose 0.9 percent yesterday.  Applications for  unemployment  payments in the U.S. probably
fell to 371,000 in the week ended Jan. 28 from 377,000 the
previous week, according to the median estimate of economists in
a Bloomberg News survey. The Labor Department will release the
figures today.  Merkel said in a speech in Beijing today that Europe’s
crisis was with sovereign debt, not it’s shared currency. The
euro “needs our joint protection and we have got to be
united,” she said.  ‘Decisive’ Actions  Implied volatility for one-month dollar-yen options
increased to 8.435 percent yesterday, the highest since Dec. 5.  Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi today said he “can’t
overlook” speculative moves in the foreign-exchange market and
is ready take “decisive” actions if necessary. His ministry
sold the yen on Oct. 31 when it climbed to the postwar record of
75.35 per dollar, eroding earnings at exporters.  “There is caution against possible intervention beyond the
76 per dollar mark,” said Kazuo Shirai, a trader at Union Bank
NA in  Los Angeles .  The yen has gained 5.7 percent over the past six months,
the second-best performance after the dollar among the 10
currencies tracked by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes. The euro has lost 2.2 percent.  Greek Negotiations  Demand for the euro was limited as  Greece  struggles to
reach agreement with private creditors on writedowns on the
nation’s debt. Prime Minister  Lucas Papademos  said Jan. 31 that
he wants to bring the negotiations on a debt-swap agreement “to
a successful conclusion by the end of the week.”  In discussions late last week in  Athens , bondholders
lowered their demands for an average coupon on the new 30-year
securities they would receive to as little as 3.6 percent from
4.25 percent after European officials demanded they take steeper
losses, people familiar with the matter said at the time.  “The euro is vulnerable to the downside,” said  Annette Beacher , head of Asia-Pacific research at TD Securities Inc. in
Singapore. “I don’t think there’s really big improvement out of
 Europe  yet. We’re a long way from being out of the woods.”  Australian Trade  Australia’s dollar reached a five-month high after a report
showed the nation’s trade surplus widened in December to A$1.71
billion ($1.83 billion) from a revised A$1.34 billion the
previous month. Economists had estimated a surplus of A$1.2
billion.  The so-called Aussie climbed 0.2 percent to $1.0726 after
touching $1.0757, the most since Sept. 1. New Zealand’s dollar,
nicknamed the kiwi, added 0.2 percent to 83.39 U.S. cents.  “The so-called risk currencies like Aussie and kiwi can be
very well-supported,” said  Joseph Capurso , a foreign-exchange
strategist in Sydney at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.  South Korea ’s won jumped as central bank data showed the
nation’s foreign-exchange reserves increased by $4.94 billion to
$311.3 billion at the end of January from a month earlier. A
separate report from the Financial Supervisory Service indicated
that foreign funds bought 6.2 trillion won ($5.5 billion) more
Korean shares than they sold in January, the most since the
regulator began tracking the data in 1992.  The won gained as much as 0.8 percent to 1,117.35 per
dollar, the strongest since Nov. 14, before trading at 1,118.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
