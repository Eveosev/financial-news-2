Westport Innovations Inc. (WPT) , which
develops technology for natural-gas engines, fell the most since
October after  Navistar International Corp. (NAV) ’s expansion plans
spurred concern Westport will lose market share.  Westport plunged as much as  8.9 percent  after Navistar, the
maker of heavy-duty trucks, said it will expand its offerings of
models that use natural-gas engines. Shares of Vancouver-based
Westport dropped 7.9 percent to C$38.34 at 3:49 p.m. Toronto
time after closing at a 10-year high yesterday.  Some Navistar trucks will use an engine developed by
Westport and Cummins Inc., while others will have an engine
Navistar is developing with Leyland, England-based Clean Air
Power Ltd. Navistar, a truckmaker based in Lisle,  Illinois , will
continue to sell vehicles with an engine it developed with
Emissions Solutions Inc. of McKinney,  Texas .  “The excitement around Westport engines is around their
unique, heavy-duty technology” called high-pressure direct
injection, Rupert M. Merer, a Toronto-based analyst at National
Bank of Canada, said in a telephone interview. “Clearly,
Navistar is stating they’re going to be developing a competing
product to the HPDI.”  Westport surged 23 percent in January, extending its 12-
month rally to  165 percent , as U.S. President  Barack Obama 
promoted natural-gas use and the price of the fuel touched a
nine-year low. The company signed its own research and
development deals with General Motors Co. and Caterpillar Inc.
last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
