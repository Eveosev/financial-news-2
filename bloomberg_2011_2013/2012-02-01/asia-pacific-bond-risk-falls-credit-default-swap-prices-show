The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment fell,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 0.5 basis points to 182.5 as of
8:31 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole SA prices show. The
measure is set for its second straight decrease, according to
data provider CMA. The gauge has fallen 24 basis points this
year, according to CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index fell 2 basis points to 158 as
of 9:45 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The index
is on track for its lowest close since Sept. 16. It fell 12.9
basis points last week, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index fell 0.5 basis points to
157.5 as of 11:31 in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
