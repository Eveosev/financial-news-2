About 1,500 Romanian miners started
an unannounced strike in seven coal mines in the southwestern
area of Valea Jului, demanding higher salaries and better
working conditions,  Mediafax  reported.  Some of the miners have blocked themselves in the
underground mines, while others marched to the headquarters of
Compania Nationala a Huilei SA, the mining company based in the
town of Petrosani, the Bucharest-based news service said.  The miners claim that Economy Minister Ion Ariton hasnâ€™t
respected an agreement with unions to increase coal-selling
prices, employ younger people and raise wages starting Feb. 1,
according to Mediafax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
