Osi Umenyiora of the  New York Giants 
was fined $20,000 by the National Football League for missing
today’s mandatory media availability ahead of the Super Bowl.  “I misunderstood the schedule,” Umenyiora said in a
statement. “It won’t happen again, and I will be at tomorrow’s
media session and available after the game. I apologize for any
inconvenience my absence this morning may have caused.”  Umenyiora, a defensive end who has nine sacks in nine games
this season, was in team meetings after missing today’s 45-
minute media session at the team hotel.  The Giants play the  New England Patriots  in the NFL’s
championship game on Feb. 5 in Indianapolis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
