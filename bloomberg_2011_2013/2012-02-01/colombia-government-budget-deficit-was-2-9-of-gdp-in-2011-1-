Colombia ’s central government budget
deficit was 2.9 percent of gross domestic product last year,
less than the government’s December forecast of 3.2 percent, as
strong economic growth boosts tax revenue.  The Andean nation’s consolidated budget deficit, which
includes states, municipalities and state-run companies, was 2.2
percent of GDP, compared with the government’s prior estimate of
2.9 percent, Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry told
reporters in Bogota.  Quickening economic growth and rising foreign direct
investment are bolstering tax revenue and reducing the
government’s financing needs. Tax revenue surged 25 percent in
2011 to 83.7 trillion pesos ($46.5 billion) from a year ago,
Echeverry said.  This year the government targets a central government
budget deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP and a consolidated budget
deficit of 1.8 percent, he said.  Colombia suspended auctions of short-term notes, known as
TCOs, in the first half of the year as increased cash holdings
reduced the need for liquidity, Echeverry said. The government
in June will decide if it carries out the auctions in the second
half of the year, Echeverry said.  The yield on the nation’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.33
percent, according to the central bank. The price rose 0.198
centavo to 121.2630 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
