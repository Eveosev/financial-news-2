The Benetton family will offer 276.6
million euros ($364 million) for the shares it doesn’t own in
 Benetton Group SpA (BEN)  to delist the clothing maker a quarter
century after its initial share sale as growing competition
eroded its earnings and market value.  Edizione Holding SpA, which owns 67 percent of Benetton,
will offer 4.6 euros a share for the stock it doesn’t already
hold, Edizione said in a statement last night on the Italian
exchange.  Benetton rose 17 percent to 4.74 euros today. The  stock  has
gained 50 percent since Jan. 25, valuing the company at 866
million euros.  Removing the shares from trading would provide the
 management  of Benetton with the “required flexibility in the
medium to long term to take the actions necessary to meet the
challenges arising from the changed competitive environment,”
Edizione said in the statement. Benetton hired Morgan Stanley to
advise on the offer.  Benetton, known for its brightly colored knitwear and
controversial advertising campaigns, had a market value of more
than 4 billion euros a decade ago. Growing competition from
clothing retailers such as  Inditex SA (ITX) ’s Zara contributed to a
slump in the company’s share price.  Benetton first sold shares to the public in 1986, when it
listed stock in Milan, according to the company’s website. The
shares began trading in  Frankfurt  two years later and on the New
York Stock Exchange in 1989.  Benetton’s net income in 2011 fell to “slightly” more
than 70 million euros from 102.8 million euros in 2010, it said
on Jan. 31. Inditex, now the world’s largest clothing retailer,
earned more than eight times that amount in just the third
quarter of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
