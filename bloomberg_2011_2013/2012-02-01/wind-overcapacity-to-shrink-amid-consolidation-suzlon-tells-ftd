Wind-industry overcapacity will be
absorbed by 2014 as demand grows and companies consolidate,
mainly in China,  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL)  Chief Executive Officer
 Tulsi Tanti  told the  Financial Times Deutschland .  No more than five Chinese wind-turbine makers are likely to
survive, out of a total of about 80 in the country, Tanti told
the German newspaper in an interview.  Suzlon targets sales growth of 30 percent this year and
isnâ€™t planning acquisitions, the FTD cited Tanti as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
