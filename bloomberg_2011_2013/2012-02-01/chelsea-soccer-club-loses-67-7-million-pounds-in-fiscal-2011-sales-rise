Chelsea FC Plc’s 2011 fiscal year
loss narrowed to 67.7 million pounds ($107 million) as the west
London Premier League  soccer club  got more revenue from European
competitions.  The loss in the 12 months ended June 30, 2011 was down from
70.9 million pounds in the year-earlier period, the team said
today in a statement on its website. Sales rose 8 percent to a
club record 222.3 million pounds in the latest fiscal year.  European soccer clubs are trying to narrow their losses in
anticipation of new rules put in by the sport’s regional
governing body,  UEFA , that will penalize teams that fail to meet
financial goals. Chelsea said game-day sales and commercial
revenues “held up well,” without giving details.  “The club is focused on complying with the requirements of
UEFA’s financial fair play regulations while maintaining its
ability to challenge for major trophies,” Chairman Bruce Buck
said in the statement. “We would expect this to be reflected in
our results for the current financial year.”  Chelsea is in fourth place in the Premier League, 12 points
off of the lead after 23 matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
