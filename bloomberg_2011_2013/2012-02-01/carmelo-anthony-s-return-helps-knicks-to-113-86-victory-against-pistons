Carmelo Anthony  returned from injury
to score 25 points and help the  New York Knicks  end a three-game
losing streak with a 113-86 victory against the  Detroit Pistons 
in a National Basketball Association game.  Anthony had missed two games with injuries to his ankle,
wrist and thumb.  “My legs felt great out there tonight,” Anthony told
reporters. “I felt refreshed. Just taking these five, six days
off that I did really helped me out big time.”  The Knicks shot 60 percent from the field last night and
made half of their 18 3-point attempts. It was the first time
New York shot better than 50 percent from the field this season.  “A lot of that is Melo,” Knicks coach  Mike D’Antoni  said.
“You could see he was well, he looked good and we play a lot of
him and he draws a lot of attention, makes it easy for everybody
else, kind of puts everybody else back in their roles that they
do. And we struggled with him out or with him hurt.”  Landry Fields scored 18 points, Tyson Chandler had 17 and
Amar’e Stoudemire added 15 in the Knicks’ home victory at
Madison Square Garden.  Reserve Jonas Jerebko led the Pistons, who have lost six
straight games, with 15 points.  The Knicks (8-13) hold third place in the Eastern
Conference’s five-team Atlantic Division, seven games behind the
Philadelphia 76ers. The Pistons (4-19) are 14 games behind the
 Chicago Bulls  in last place in the Central Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
