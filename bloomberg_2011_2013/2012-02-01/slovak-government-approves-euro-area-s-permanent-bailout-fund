Slovakia’s outgoing government
approved the country’s participation in the euro region’s
permanent bailout fund, the bloc’s main tool to prevent future
fiscal crises.  The Cabinet approved the creation of the so-called European
Stability Mechanism at a meeting today in Bratislava, the
capital, according to the government’s website. Slovakia will
contribute 659 million euros ($869 million) in cash and about 5
billion euros in guarantees into the 700 billion-euro fund.  The agreement on the mechanism must be approved also by
parliament in the second-poorest euro-sharing nation. Slovakia
was the last country to ratify the enlargement of the ESM’s
temporary predecessor last year, failing to back it in the first
vote, which triggered the collapse of Iveta Radicova’s
government and an agreement on early elections in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
