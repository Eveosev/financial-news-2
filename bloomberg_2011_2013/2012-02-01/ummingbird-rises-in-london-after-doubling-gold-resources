Hummingbird Resources Plc (HUM) , owner of
gold exploration licenses in Liberia, rose to the highest in 13
months after more than doubling its total gold resources.  Hummingbird shares jumped as much as 9.5 percent to 172.5
pence in London, the highest since December 2010. The company
raised its total gold resources to 3.7 million ounces today
after announcing it has an additional 2.05 million ounces at the
Tuzon pit in eastern Liberia.  “This delivers the kind of scales sufficient to justify a
multi-open pit mining complex,” Dominic O’Kane, an analyst at
Liberum Capital Ltd. in London, said in a note to investors.
“Hummingbird has only drilled about 1 percent of its 7,000
square-kilometer holdings; it has potential to uncover a new
gold province.”  The company would go ahead with building a mine once
resources exceed 3 million ounces, Managing Director Daniel Betts said last month. It needs to raise about $40 million to
complete feasibility studies, which would take about two years.  Hummingbird will then need two years to finish construction
at a cost of $200 million to $250 million, Betts said. The
company aims to have annual production of 200,000 ounces of gold
with a mine life of about 15 years, he said.  “Its drilling has a remarkable success rate and with its
unrivaled regional potential, Hummingbird is a small cap
conviction,” Liberum said. “ Calculated on peers’ average
traded value of $125 an ounce for indicated and $43 ounce for
inferred,” 352 pence a share is a fair value for the company.  The shares were up 6 percent to 167 pence at 10:21 a.m.,
valuing the company at 89 million pounds ($140 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
