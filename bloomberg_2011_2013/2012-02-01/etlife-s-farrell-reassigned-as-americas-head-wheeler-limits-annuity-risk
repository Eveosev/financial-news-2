MetLife Inc. (MET) , the biggest U.S. life
insurer, reassigned Michael Farrell, previously head of U.S.
distribution, as the company seeks to reduce sales of equity-
linked variable annuities.  Farrell “is moving to a position in global employee
benefits,”  John Calagna , a spokesman for New York-based
MetLife, said in an e-mail today. In filings last year to the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Farrell was listed as
president of MetLife Investors USA Insurance Co., a unit that
issues variable-annuity contracts.  MetLife is curbing annuity risk as it focuses on
integrating non-U.S. businesses acquired from American
International Group Inc. in 2010. Variable annuities, savings
products often sold with guaranteed returns, exceeded MetLife’s
sales target of $18 billion last year. William Wheeler, who
heads the Americas division, said in December that 2011 sales
would be “in the high 20s.”  “That’s obviously much more than we had expected,”
Wheeler said in a Dec. 5 conference call with analysts. “We’re
going to take the steps necessary to get that back into its
proper risk profile inside MetLife.”  Chief Executive Officer  Steven Kandarian , promoted to the
top spot in May, is reorganizing management as he sets his
strategy and integrates the former AIG operations stretching
from  Japan  to  Chile . In November, he split oversight of MetLife
into three geographic divisions and installed Eric Steigerwalt
as interim chief financial officer. Wheeler was formerly CFO.
Steigerwalt will eventually move to retail when a permanent CFO
is named, Calagna said.  “We are continuing to implement our reorganization plan as
we take the necessary steps to transform MetLife from a leading
life insurance company to a world-class global insurance and
employee benefits provider,” Calagna said.  Donna Demaio, head of MetLife Bank, will continue to report
to Wheeler, Calagna said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
