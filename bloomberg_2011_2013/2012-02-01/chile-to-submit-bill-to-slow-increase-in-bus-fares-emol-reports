Chile’s government will submit a bill
to Congress in March to slow fare increases on Santiago’s public
transportation system, El Mercurio said in its online edition
 Emol.com , citing Transportation Minister Pedro Pablo Errazuriz.  The legislation would amend a law that reduces government
subsidies for the system, the newspaper cited the minister as
saying in an interview with Canal 13 television. Bus fares,
which would be about 900 pesos ($1.84) without subsidies, are
increasing by 20 pesos today to 580 pesos, the Santiago-based
paper  reported .  The legislation wouldn’t prevent fares from increasing if
fuel costs rise, it reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
