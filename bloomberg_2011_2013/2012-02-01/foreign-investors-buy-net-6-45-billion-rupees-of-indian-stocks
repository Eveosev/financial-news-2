Overseas  investors  bought a net  6.45
billion rupees  ($130 million) of Indian equities yesterday,
taking total investments in equities this year to 110 billion
rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 34.6 billion rupees of shares and sold
28.1 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. They bought a net 1.09 billion rupees
of bonds, raising total inflow into debt this year to 160.8
billion rupees, the data  show .  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  India’s $1.1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Flows surged to a record
in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the world’s
top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led to the
biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  Foreign  funds  have placed 4.554 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.368 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993. They invested 421 billion rupees in bonds
last year.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
