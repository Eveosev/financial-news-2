LG Chem Ltd. (05'910) ,  South Korea ’s biggest
chemicals maker, rose to the highest level in more than five
months in Seoul trading on expectations recovering petrochemical
prices and sales of electric-car batteries will boost earnings.  The shares  gained  3.7 percent to 388,000 won, their highest
since Aug. 11. The benchmark Kospi Index climbed 0.2 percent.  Chief Executive Officer Kim Bahn Suk said earnings growth
may gain momentum in the second half this year, after LG Chem
reported yesterday the smallest quarterly profit in 2011.
Petrochemical margins are improving and LG Chem’s investment in
electronics has started to pay off, said Anthony Kim, a Seoul-
based analyst at Woori Investment & Securities Co.  “Earnings are expected to rise quarter by quarter this
year, drawing some investors to buy the stock,” said Kim, who
maintains a “buy”  recommendation  on LG Chem.  Operating profit at the company’s electronics division,
which makes batteries for notebooks and electric cars, more than
doubled in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. LG Chem is
set to “reap the fruits” of its investments in liquid crystal
display glass and rechargeable batteries, Kim said.  Prices of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, used in cosmetic
cases and sporting goods, rose to $2,020 a metric ton in January
after slumping to a year-low of $1,816 in November, according to
LG Chem presentation materials given out to investors yesterday.  Overall first-quarter operating profit may rise 35 percent
from the previous three months to 684.4 billion won ($608
million), according to Kim.  To contact the reporters on this story:
