The zloty rose to a five-month high
versus the euro and bonds rallied after a report showed Polish
manufacturing grew for the first time in three months.  The zloty appreciated 1 percent to 4.1904 per euro as of
4:46 p.m. in Warsaw, the strongest intraday level since Sept. 5.
The yield on 10-year bonds fell 3 basis points to 5.55 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of manufacturing,
rose to 52.2 from 48.8 in December, HSBC Holdings Plc said,
summarizing the results of a survey by  Markit Economics . A
median estimate of 17 economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast
an advance to 49.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Manufacturing “surprised on the upside,”  Rafal Benecki ,
senior economist at ING Bank Slaski SA, wrote in an e-mailed
note to clients. The central bank “should remain hawkish in
coming months, supporting the zloty.”  Poland’s economy, which last year expanded at the fastest
pace since 2008, will grow more than 3 percent this year,
central bank Governor Marek Belka said on Jan. 27. The central
bank should raise its benchmark  interest rate  this quarter to
counter an inflation rate that remains “stubbornly” high, said
central banker Andrzej Kazmierczak said a day earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
