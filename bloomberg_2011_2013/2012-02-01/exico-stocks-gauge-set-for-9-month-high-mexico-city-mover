Mexico ’s benchmark IPC stock  index 
hit a nine-month high as U.S. economic data buoyed optimism
about Latin America’s second-biggest economy.  The gauge climbed 0.8 percent to 37,709.65 at the close in
Mexico City, the highest since April 6, 2011. The gauge has
recovered 19 percent from a two-year low on Aug. 8.  U.S. manufacturing grew last month at the fastest pace
since June in the latest sign of buoyancy in the world’s biggest
economy, which purchases about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.
That’s adding to demand for emerging-market assets as concern
eases about Europe’s debt crisis, said  Ed Kuczma , who helps
manage $35 billion at Van Eck Associates in  New York .  “Data out of the U.S. has been a little better than
expected, so I think Mexico benefits from having a strong
neighbor to the north,” Kuczma said by phone. “Globally you’ve
seen a reintroduction of risk positions in investors’
portfolios.”  Empresas Ica SAB (ICA*) , the country’s biggest construction
company, has led gains among 35 stocks on the IPC this year,
advancing 27 percent.
       Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO) , the world’s largest Spanish-language
broadcaster, jumped 2.9 percent today after falling for nine
straight sessions. The company is awaiting an antitrust ruling
on a proposal to acquire a 50 percent stake in mobile-phone
provider Grupo Iusacell SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
