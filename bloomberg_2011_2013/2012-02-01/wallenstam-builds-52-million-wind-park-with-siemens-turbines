Wallenstam AB (WALLB) , a Gothenburg-based real
estate company, started work on a 350 million krona ($52
million) wind park in southern  Sweden .  Wallenstam expects to complete the 18.4-megawatt park in
the Uddevalla municipality early next year, the company said
today in a statement. The project will use turbines made by
German manufacturer Siemens AG, each with a 2.3-megawatt
capacity.  Wallenstam aims to meet its own energy needs, as well as
those of its customers, using clean power by 2013, the company
said in the statement. Sweden is seeking to get 50 percent of
its energy use from renewable sources by 2020.  “We want to control our energy bills so we can foresee our
costs and curb our dependence on the energy market,” Elisabeth
Vansvik, a spokeswoman for the company, said today by phone.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
