Aetna Inc. (AET) , the third-largest U.S.
health insurer, could make acquisitions larger than the $1.35
billion in deployable capital the company has this year, Chief
Financial Officer Joe Zubretsky said today.  The insurer also might sell shares or use stock in order to
fund larger purchases this year, Zubretsky said. Hartford,
Connecticut-based Aetna spent $1.6 billion on deals last year.  “We are agnostic as to size,” Zubretsky said in an
interview. “We are looking for anything that’s in our strategic
plan, including Medicare, Medicaid, building out technology and
engaging the consumer.”  With pressure on how much insurers can be reimbursed for
care under the 2010 health-care overhaul, health plans are
looking to acquire companies to gain new members.  Humana Inc. (HUM) 
Chief Executive Officer Michael McCallister said last week that
his company was open to deals worth more than $1 billion to
expand in Medicare.  Aetna rose 3.1 percent to $45.07 at the close in  New York ,
after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that met analyst
estimates. The shares have gained 33 percent in the last 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
