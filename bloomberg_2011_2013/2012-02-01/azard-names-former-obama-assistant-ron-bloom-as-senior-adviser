Lazard Ltd. (LAZ)  named  Ron Bloom , a former
assistant to President Barack Obama for manufacturing policy, as
a senior adviser.  Bloom, 56, will provide strategic advice to Lazard, the
largest independent merger adviser, and its investment banking
and restructuring clients, the Hamilton, Bermuda-based firm said
today in a statement. Lazard and Bloom were hired in October by
the National Association of Letter Carriers, which represents
mail carriers for the U.S. Postal Service, to develop ideas to
restructure the service.  Bloom helped oversee the Obama administration’s bailouts of
General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC and then became the
president’s manufacturing policy adviser. He resigned his White
House post in August. Before joining the White House, Bloom was
a senior adviser to the U.S. Treasury Department.  “Ron brings a unique blend of knowledge of the public and
private sectors, with a particular expertise in advising on
complicated transactions involving multiple stakeholders,”
Antonio Weiss, global head of  investment banking , said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
