Workers at Cyprus’s Coca-Cola bottler
Lanitis Brothers Ltd., a unit of  Greece ’s Coca-Cola HBC, and
KEAN Soft Drinks Ltd, will hold a 24-hour strike tomorrow and
may decide to prolong it, a union official said.  “We are going ahead with the strikes because employers are
violating a collective agreement” by refusing to compensate
workers for inflation, Giorgos Kasouris, an official at  SEK , one
of the two major unions on the east Mediterranean island, said
today on the phone.  Pepsi-cola bottler Andreou & Paraskevaides Enterprises Plc
agreed today to grant workers a 1.7 percent pay rise for the
loss of purchasing power they suffered in the second half of
2011 through  inflation , Kasouris added.  -- Editor: Tim Farrand  To contact the reporter on this story:
