Yoox SpA (YOOX)  Chief Executive Officer
 Federico Marchetti  raised his stake in the online retailer of
fashion and luxury goods after exercising  stock options , saying
the Italian company is being undervalued by investors.  Marchetti, 42, increased his  holding  in the Bologna-based
company to 6.594 percent from 4.785 percent, Italy’s market
regulator said today in a  statement . On a fully diluted basis,
the executive’s stake remains 11.083 percent, making him the
single largest shareholder, according to the company.  “The current stock price doesn’t fully reflect the real
value of the company,” Marchetti, who founded the company in
2000 and is also its chairman, said in a phone interview. The
CEO said he spent 5 million euros ($6.59 million), including
tax, for the additional stock.  Yoox  shares  have more than doubled since an initial public
offering in 2009, giving the distributor of brands including
Diesel and Valentino a market value of 466 million euros. The
stock rose as much as 3.4 percent today and was trading up 1.5
percent at 8.80 euros at 4:50 p.m. in Milan.  Sales in the first nine months of 2011 climbed 36 percent
to 204.4 million euros, Yoox said in November. The online
retailer reports fourth-quarter revenue on Feb. 8.  “The U.S. is growing significantly, Asia is in full sail
and other European markets like Russia are doing extremely
well,” Marchetti said. Italy, which accounts for about a fifth
of revenue, “continues to grow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
