Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s
“nationalism” risks isolating  Hungary  in the European Union,
Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg told the Figyelo
newspaper.  Schwarzenberg said he’s concerned Hungary may “leave
European Union mainstream politics when it comes to the
constitution, central bank regulation and the treatment of
foreign banks and investors,” according to a transcript of an
interview to be published tomorrow in the Budapest-based weekly
newspaper. “Hungary is treading its own path. But I’m concerned
it will isolate itself.”  Hungary is the only member of the union where “nationalism
is the main thrust of government policy, the only place where
this enjoys a two-thirds parliamentary backing,” Schwarzenberg
said, according to the e-mailed transcript.  To contact the reporter on this story:
