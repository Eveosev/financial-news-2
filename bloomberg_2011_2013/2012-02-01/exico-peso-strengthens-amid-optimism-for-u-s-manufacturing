Mexico ’s peso advanced the most in
two weeks as speculation that manufacturing growth is quickening
in the U.S. boosted the outlook for the Latin American country’s
exports.  The peso rose 0.8 percent to 12.9408 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:08 a.m. in Mexico City, from 13.0456 yesterday. The peso has
gained 7.7 percent this year.  The Institute for Supply Management will say today that its
factory index rose to 54.5 last month from 53.1 in December,
according to the median estimate of 80 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg, signaling industry will lead a U.S. expansion. The
reading would be the highest since June. Mexico sends 80 percent
of its exports to the U.S.  The forecast for manufacturing “is part of the rosier
outlook for the whole U.S. recovery story,” Aryam Vazquez, an
emerging-markets economist at  Wells Fargo & Co ., said in a
telephone interview from  New York . “The overall momentum on the
peso, the macro fundamentals and the overall risk dynamics are
the key drivers for the underlying trend in the peso.”  Mexico’s economy probably grew 3.7 percent in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier and 4 percent in 2011, the  Finance
Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement on Jan. 30.  The yield on Mexico’s peso-denominated bonds due in 2024
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.16
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price of
the securities rose 0.22 centavo to 134.04 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporters on this story:
