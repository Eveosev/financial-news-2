Commodity shipping costs slumped to
the lowest in a quarter century as a glut of new carriers
overwhelmed demand at a time of slowing global economic growth.  The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) , a measure of costs across four vessel
sizes, retreated 2.6 percent to 662 points today, according to
the London-based  Baltic Exchange , which publishes rates across
more than 50 maritime routes. The gauge fell 61 percent this
year and is now at its lowest since August 1986. Rates for
Capesizes, the largest iron ore and coal carriers, dropped 84
percent since mid-December.  The decline in rates is masking gains in world trade, with
London-based Clarkson Plc, the world’s biggest shipbroker,
predicting record cargoes of everything from iron ore to oil.
The  International Monetary Fund  expects a third annual gain in
world trade as economies recover from the worst global recession
since World War II. About 90 percent of trade moves by sea,
according to the Round Table of Shipping Associations.  “The biggest problem is that the fleet is continuing to
expand like there’s no tomorrow,” said Sverre Svenning,
director of research at Fearnley Consultants AS, a unit of Oslo-
based shipbroker Astrup Fearnley. “We’ve seen that the
imbalance between demand and supply has just kept increasing.”  The fleet of dry-bulk commodity carriers will expand 14
percent this year, compared with a 3 percent gain in seaborne
volumes of minerals and grains, according to Clarkson. Yards
delivered 146 dry-bulk carriers last month, an all-time high,
Svenning said. The IMF cut its 2012 forecast for global economic
growth on Jan. 24 to 3.3 percent from 4 percent.  Charter Costs  The global fleet of  Capesizes (BCAVRT)  expanded 56 percent since the
end of 2008 and orders at ship yards are equal to 26 percent of
existing capacity, according to data from Redhill, England-based
IHS Fairplay. Some ships were ordered in 2008 when daily rates
reached $234,000. Charter costs were priced at $5,327 today,
Baltic Exchange data show.  Owners are idling vessels rather than accepting current
rates and  Australia , the biggest  iron-ore  exporter, is “awash
with ships waiting to load,” the Baltic Exchange said in a
report to members yesterday.  “I can’t see much happening until March or April 2013,”
said Derek Prentis, an 86-year-old shipbroker and consultant who
is the Baltic Exchange’s longest-serving member.  Pure Play  Eight of the 14 companies in the Bloomberg Pure Play Dry
Bulk Shipping  Index (BPG4DBS)  will report lower profit or losses in 2012,
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show. The gauge slumped
33 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 5.9 percent
drop in the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities.  Returns for three of the four ship types in the index are
too low to cover operating costs, and they’re below zero on two
of 29 dry-bulk routes, data from the exchange and accounting
firm Moore Stephens International LLP show. Capesize and Panamax
ships are earning 30 percent and 38 percent, respectively, of
the amounts Pareto Securities ASA, an Oslo-based investment
bank, says they need to break even.  “We are in the third year of record vessel deliveries,”
said  Jeffrey Landsberg , president of Commodore Research, a New
York-based shipping consultant. “Combined with the Chinese
steel market being weak, that’s why freight rates are as low as
they are.”  Vessels are slowing speeds and dropping anchor to better
manage the oversupply. Capesize vessel  speeds  averaged 9.24
knots in the week ended Jan. 29, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. That’s the slowest since records started in May 2008.  There are 2,077 dry-bulk vessels  at anchor , from a record
fleet of 7,933, according to the data. That includes 310
Capesize ships anchored from the fleet of 1,203, nine fewer than
the  record  318 on Jan. 19, the data show. The overall  dry-bulk 
fleet’s average weekly speed of 8.15 knots for the week ended
Jan. 29 is the slowest since at least May 2008, the data show.  Panamaxes (BPRATCR) , the largest vessels to navigate the Panama
Canal, dropped 4.2 percent to a three-year low of $5,515.
Supramax vessels declined 2.8 percent to $6,657 and Handysizes,
the smallest ships in the index, slid 2.4 percent to $5,853.  To contact the reporter on this story:
