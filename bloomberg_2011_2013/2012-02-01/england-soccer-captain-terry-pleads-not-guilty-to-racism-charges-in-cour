England soccer captain  John Terry 
will fight criminal charges that he racially abused Queens Park
Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during an Oct. 23 Premier
League match.  Lawyers for Terry pleaded not guilty on his behalf at a
London criminal court today, said Rachael Collins, a spokeswoman
for the court. Terry, who plays for Premier League team Chelsea,
didn’t appear at Westminster Magistrates Court, she said.  Prosecutors charged Terry in December with using
“threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior” that was
“within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused
harassment, alarm or distress which was racially aggravated”
during the October soccer game at Loftus Road Stadium in London.  Alison Saunders, the chief prosecutor for  London , said she
was “satisfied there is sufficient evidence for a realistic
prospect of conviction and it is in the public interest to
prosecute this case.”  Chelsea lost the game 1-0. Terry faces a maximum fine of
2,500 pounds ($3,900) if convicted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
