Egypt  plans to offer 13 billion
Egyptian pounds ($2.2 billion) in treasury bills and bonds over
the next week after receiving aid commitments from the European
Union and World Bank.  The country raised 4.55 billion pounds at debt auctions in
the past week, or 30 percent of its goal, as treasury-bill
yields rose to records. The average on  one-year securities 
climbed for the 14th time to 15.867 percent, the highest level
since Bloomberg started tracking the data in 2006.  The lack of aid and the withdrawal of foreign investors
from the domestic  debt market  amid political unrest has forced
the country to increase its reliance on local banks to fund the
widening budget deficit. Egyptian banks have  increased their
holdings  of local treasury bills by 52 percent in the first 10
months of last year to 249.8 billion pounds, according to
central bank data.  The European Union is preparing an aid package for Egypt
valued at $650 million and the  World Bank  will provide $500
million in “expedited financial support,” the  Finance Ministry 
said in a statement today. The Arab country hasn’t received any
of its share of $35 billion pledged by the Group of Eight major
economies to Egypt and  Tunisia , Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri
said yesterday.  Egypt will offer six- and 12-month notes tomorrow valued at
3 billion pounds and 3.5 billion pounds, respectively, according
to central bank data on Bloomberg. It will also seek bids for
3.5 billion pounds in nine-month securities and five- and seven-
year bonds valued at 2 billion pounds and 1 billion pounds,
respectively, on Feb. 6.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020
dropped two basis points, or 0.02 of a percentage point, to 7.14
percent at 1:49 p.m. in Cairo, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The pound strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 6.027
a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
