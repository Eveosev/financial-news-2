OGX Petroleo e Gas Participacoes SA ,
the oil explorer controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista , plans
to drill additional wells at a recent discovery in the Santos
Basin and may increase estimated reserves in the area.  OGX, based in  Rio de Janeiro , halted drilling at the OGX-63
well to replace the current rig with one that can handle the
high pressure encountered in the reservoir, the company said
today in a regulatory filing. OGX found hydrocarbons in two
separate well sections, including the thickest reservoir the
company has found to date in shallow waters of Santos.  OGX will “drill delimitation wells to assess the existing
volumes in the area which may potentially surpass current
estimates,” the company said.  OGX estimates 1.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil and
equivalents at Santos. The company has drilled the well to
nearly four miles below the sea floor where it has found a so-
called pre-salt reservoir, similar to the geology at  Brazil ’s
biggest discoveries in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  To contact the reporter on this story:
