Geographic surveys conducted in 2011
in the Russian Arctic could add as much as 1.2 million square
kilometers (463,000 square miles) to  Russia ’s continental shelf,
according to the Natural Resources Ministry.  The research could “facilitate Russia’s right to develop
rich hydrocarbon reserves” in the  Arctic Ocean , the ministry
said today in an e-mailed statement, citing a report by Anatoly Ledovskikh, the head of the subsoil resources agency known as
Rosnedra.  Oil and gas exploration across Russia in 2011 is expected
to add 700 million metric tons of crude and gas condensate and
1.1 trillion cubic meters of natural gas to the country’s
reserves, according to the statement. Russia produced 511
million tons of crude and condensate and 638 billion cubic
meters of gas in 2011, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
