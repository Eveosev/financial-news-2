The  Trans Adriatic Pipeline  venture
is willing to cooperate with shareholders of the  Interconnection
Turkey-Greece-Italy  pipeline group,  Kathimerini  said, citing
TAP’s External Affairs Director Michael Hoffman.  TAP is ready to work with ITGI holders in the event that
TAP is chosen by  Azerbaijan  to transport natural gas to  Europe 
from the Shah Deniz 2 gas field with the pipeline becoming the
so-called southern corridor route for transporting Caspian Sea
gas into the European Union, the Athens-based newspaper today
cited Hoffman as saying.  Both pipelines plan to cross  Greece . ITGI is a joint
venture of Greece’s Depa SA and Italy’s  Edison Spa. (EDN)   To contact the reporter on this story:
