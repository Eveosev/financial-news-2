Australian sales of newly built homes
dropped 4.9 percent in December from a month earlier, the
Canberra-based Housing Industry Association said.  Detached house sales fell 7.7 percent, while apartments
surged by 29.4 percent, HIA said in a report today.  “The intensification of bad news regarding  Europe ,
question marks over labor market prospects in Australia, and
avoidable delay and uncertainty as to whether banks were going
to pass on the Reserve Bank’s second rate cut conspired to drive
a fall in new housing contracts as the holiday season
approached,” Harley Dale, HIA chief economist, said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
