Japanese shares  advanced, with the
 Topix (TPX)  Index snapping a four-day loss, after  All Nippon Airways (9202) 
Co. raised its operating profit forecast and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines
Ltd. led shipping companies higher.  All Nippon Airways,  Asia ’s largest listed carrier by sales,
jumped 6.8 percent. Mitsui O.S.K. led a rebound among cargo
lines after Jefferies Group Inc. boosted its target price.
 Unicharm Corp. (8113)  rose 2.1 percent after a report the diaper maker
will double its production capacity in India.  “Earnings aren’t looking that bad,” said Hisakazu Amano,
who helps oversee the equivalent of $29 billion at T&D Asset
Management Co. in Tokyo. “Investors aren’t buying across the
board, but they’re picking companies that have specific
strengths and that’s buoying the market.”  The Topix, Japan’s broadest gauge of equities, climbed 0.4
percent to 757.96 at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo, with about five
shares rising for every three that fell. The  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average  added 0.1 percent to 8,809.79.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index  slid 0.2 percent
today. The gauge fell 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday after
reports showed  consumer confidence  unexpectedly dropped in
January and  home prices  fell more than estimated in November.  Transportation Stocks Rise  All Nippon Airways soared 6.8 percent to 237 yen, the
biggest advance on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) , after raising its full-year
operating profit forecast 29 percent to 90 billion yen ($1.2
billion) as it speeds cost cuts.  Mitsui O.S.K. gained 5.9 percent to 305 yen after its
target price was lifted to 400 yen from 380 yen by Jefferies.
Nippon Yusen K.K. rose 5.7 percent to 204 yen and  Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd. (9107)  climbed 5.6 percent to 152 yen after Jefferies
raised its rating on the shippers to “buy” from “hold.” The
shipping sector is rebounding after posting the second-worst
performance among the Topix’s industry groups last year.  Unicharm increased 2.1 percent to 4,090 yen after the
Nikkei newspaper reported the diaper maker will build a second
factory in  India  this year.  Earnings Season  Of the 599 companies on the Topix that have  posted  results
for the latest quarter so far this year, 66 have exceeded
analysts’ estimates, while 112 have fallen short, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Topix (TPX)  plunged 19 percent last year after the record
March 11 earthquake and resulting nuclear disaster at the
Fukushima power plant. The decline has cut the  price  of shares
on the index to 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.1 times
for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index.  “A certain amount of money is flowing into Japanese stocks
because they are relatively undervalued in terms of price-book
ratios among global markets,” said Kazuyuki Terao, chief
investment officer of RCM  Japan  Co. “Japanese company earnings
in the current period aren’t good as a whole, but they are
likely to recover after April.”  Okuma Corp. (6103)  increased 3.8 percent to 574 yen after swinging
to profit. The machine-tool maker reported net income of 4.72
billion yen for the nine months ended Dec. 31, with a 46 percent
jump in sales and cost cuts. The company recorded a loss of 2.53
billion yen a year earlier.  Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. (6302)  declined the most in the
Nikkei 225. The company plunged 9.8 percent to 440 yen after
cutting its net-income forecast 29 percent to 20 billion yen,
citing costs tied to defective construction and reversal of
deferred tax assets.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto and Satoshi Kawano in
