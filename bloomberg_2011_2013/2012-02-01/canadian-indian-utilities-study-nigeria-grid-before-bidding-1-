Manitoba Hydro Electric Board of
Canada and  Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd.  are conducting due
diligence on  Transmission Co. of Nigeria  before presenting bids
to manage the network operator, the privatization agency said.  Nigeria  has issued the necessary documents to the two
potential investors to allow them to prepare bids, Chukwuma
Nwokoh, a spokesman for the  Bureau of Public Enterprises , said
today in an e-mailed statement, without elaborating.  Nigeria, a nation of more than 160 million people, plans to
divest majority holdings in state power utilities as it seeks
investment to curb daily blackouts. Manitoba Hydro and Power
Grid are two of three companies that were shortlisted to manage
the network in 2007. The government subsequently suspended the
sale, before inviting the companies to re-submit bids in 2010.  The privatization program includes six state-owned
electricity producers and 11 heating utilities, to be sold by
the second quarter. More than 500 bids for the power companies
were shortlisted in June from a total of 929 submitted.  Nigeria, where power demand is almost double the supply of
about 4,000 megawatts, plans to boost output to 14,019 megawatts
by 2013. Electricity shortages are costing sub-Saharan  Africa â€™s
second-biggest economy 4 percent of growth in gross domestic
product, Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said Nov. 28.  Electricity output will increase to 5,000 megawatts in the
first quarter and 6,000 megawatts by the end of the year,
according to the power ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
