Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , a U.S.
developer of geothermal energy, was given approval by the New
Zealand government to buy land in the nation’s  North Island  for
a NZ$200 million ($167 million) power plant.  Ormat was granted consent by the Overseas Investment
Office, which assesses bids for sensitive land, according to a
 document  filed on the agency’s website. The company was awarded
the project last year by New Zealand Maori land trusts after a
bidding process, according to a June 21 statement.  Ormat, a unit of Yavne, Israel-based  Ormat Industries (ORMT)  Ltd.,
is one of the biggest foreign developers of geothermal plants in
New Zealand, with interests in 12 other projects, according to
the June statement. The new plant will be located on 902
hectares (2,229 acres) of land near Rotorua, an area of high
geothermal activity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
