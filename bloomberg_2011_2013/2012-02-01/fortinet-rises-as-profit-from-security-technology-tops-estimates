Fortinet Inc. (FTNT)  jumped after the maker
of network-security technology reported fourth-quarter sales and
profit that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  Fortinet shares advanced 9.8 percent to $25.04 at the close
today, the biggest gain since Oct. 25. The stock rose 35 percent
last year.  Net income rose 2.2 percent to $16.5 million, or 10 cents a
share, the Sunnyvale, California-based company said after the
markets closed. Profit excluding certain items was 14 cents a
share, compared with the 12-cent average of predictions compiled
by Bloomberg.  The numbers reflect strong demand for security products to
protect  computer networks , particularly among large corporations
that Fortinet is increasingly targeting, said Chief Executive
Officer Ken Xie.  “Our efforts to strengthen our global sales team and
enhance our product portfolio have enabled us to successfully
penetrate the large enterprise market,” Xie said in a
statement.  Revenue rose 29 percent to $120.9 million, topping the
average estimate of $116.8 million.  The company forecast that first-quarter profit excluding
items will be 11 cents a share, which matched the average
prediction. Revenue will be $112 million to $115 million,
Fortinet said. Analysts anticipated $113.4 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
