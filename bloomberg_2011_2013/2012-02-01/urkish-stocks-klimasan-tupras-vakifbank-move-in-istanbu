Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index  surged, adding 3.6 percent to 59,215.65 at the close in
Istanbul.  The following were among the active equities on the Turkish
market today. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  , the bank part-owned by Citigroup
Inc., surged 6 percent to 7.08 liras, leading gains on the
banking index, which increased 4.6 percent to its highest since
Oct. 19.  Klimasan Klima Sanayi & Ticaret AS  (KLMSN TI), a maker of
refrigerators, jumped the most in five weeks, adding 4.1 percent
to 2.53 liras after saying its domestic sales rose 47 percent in
2011 from a year earlier.  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS (TUPRS)  , Turkey’s
sole refiner, added 4.2 percent to 42.20 liras, its highest
since July 15. Investors betting on economic recovery should buy
oil, gas and chemicals companies in Turkey and Tupras is
attractive because of its strong refining margin and high
dividend yield, HSBC Holdings Plc said in an e-mailed report
today.  Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN)  , a state-run
lender, gained 5.9 percent to 3.06 liras, its highest in 11
weeks. Vakifbank is “one of the most attractive large-cap
Turkish banks in terms of multiples” after underperforming the
index late last year, Ates Bultur, an analyst at Credit Suisse
Group AG, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
