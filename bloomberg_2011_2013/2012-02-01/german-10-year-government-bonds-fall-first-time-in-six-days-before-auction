German bonds fell, with 10-year
securities snapping a five-day advance, as optimism
manufacturing is improving around the world sapped demand for
 Europe ’s safest assets. Italian and Spanish bonds gained.  Ten-year German yields climbed from the lowest in two weeks
as  China  said factory output unexpectedly expanded in January
and an index of U.S. manufacturing rose. German bonds stayed
lower as the nation sold 4.1 billion euros ($5.38 billion) of
10-year securities. Spanish bond  yields  dropped to the lowest
level since November 2010 as stock gains spurred demand for
riskier assets. Portuguese notes rose as borrowing costs
declined at bill sales.  “There’s improved risk sentiment, peripheral yields have
come in significantly with Italy leading the way,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in London. The stock rally added “to the risk-on
move, weighing on core bonds,” he said.  Germany ’s 10-year yield rose six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.84 percent at 4:152 p.m. London time
after falling to 1.78 percent yesterday, the lowest since Jan.
18. The 2 percent bond due January 2022 dropped 0.51, or 5.10
euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 101.405.  China’s purchasing managers’ index rose to 50.5 last month
from 50.3 in December, staying above the 50 level that indicates
growth. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast 49.6. The
Institute for Supply Management’s U.S. manufacturing index
climbed to 54.1 in January from 53.1 in December, the group’s
data showed today.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index  gained 1.9 percent, and the euro
strengthened 0.9 percent to $1.3205.  German Sale  Germany sold the 10-year securities at an average yield of
1.82 percent, down from 1.93 percent at the previous auction on
Jan. 4. Investors bid for 1.4 times the amount allotted,
compared with 1.3 times at the January sale.  “Today’s tap saw significantly better demand,”  John Davies , a fixed-income strategist at WestLB AG in London, wrote
in an e-mail. “However, a bid-cover-ratio of 1.4 is still below
the 1.5 average registered during 2011.”  Italy’s 10-year yield slid 28 basis points to 5.68 percent
after falling to 5.66 percent, the least since Oct. 12. The
spread over German bunds shrank to as low as 3.82 percentage
points, the least since Dec. 8.  Spain ’s 10-year  yields  fell 13 basis points to 4.84
percent, the lowest since Nov. 23, 2010. The two-year rate
dropped 12 basis points to 2.49 percent, also reaching the least
since November 2010.  ECB Loans  Spanish and Italian bonds have rallied since the  European
Central Bank  offered unlimited three-year cash to the region’s
financial institutions in December to avoid a credit crunch. The
securities have advanced amid speculation banks are buying them
to use as collateral with the ECB under the program, known as
the longer-term refinancing operation. The central bank will
offer another set of the loans this month.  “The LTRO can contain spreads for the periphery for many,
many months to come,”  Steven Major , global head of fixed-income
research at HSBC Holdings in London, said in an interview on
with  Owen Thomas  and  David Tweed  on Bloomberg Television’s “On
the Move.” The refinancing operations meant a “large amount”
of as much as 100 billion euros went into bonds that wouldn’t
have otherwise, he said.  The ECB said today it will lend $9.4 billion over three
months to euro-area banks. The ECB will also lend 10 banks $3.7
billion in its regular weekly dollar operation.  Regained Confidence  “Markets have regained some confidence,” said  Luca Cazzulani , a senior fixed-income strategist at UniCredit Global
Research in Milan. “Investors are putting more emphasis on the
upcoming ECB LTRO operations, where strong demand is expected
and that will keep yields low.”  Italy can cut its ratio of  debt  to  gross domestic product 
to below 100 percent in 2020 by meeting its target of
eliminating the deficit in 2013, Deputy Finance Minister
 Vittorio Grilli  said today in an interview in  Rome .  Portugal ’s notes gained for a second day as the nation sold
1.5 billion euros of bills.  The country auctioned securities due in July 2012 at an
average yield of 4.463 percent, down from 4.74 percent at a
previous auction of six-month bills on Jan. 18. Investors
submitted bids for 2.6 times the amount allotted, compared with
a bid-to-cover ratio of 3 in January.  The yield on the Portuguese note due in September 2013 fell
194 basis points to 18.60 percent, with the price rising to
82.74 percent of face value.  Volatility on Portuguese sovereign debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by Italy and  Greece , according
to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year spreads and
credit-default swaps.  German bunds have returned 0.2 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Portuguese bonds fell 14 percent,
and Greek debt declined 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
