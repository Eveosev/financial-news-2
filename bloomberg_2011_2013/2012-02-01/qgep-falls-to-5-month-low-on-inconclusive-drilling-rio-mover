QGEP Participacoes SA (QGEP3) ,  Brazil ’s
third-largest oil company by market value, fell to the lowest in
more than five months after reporting “inconclusive” results
at the Ilha do Macuco offshore well in Brazil.  QGEP dropped 2.4 percent to 13.90 reais at 12:25 p.m. in
Sao Paulo trading. Earlier it fell as much as 7.1 percent to
13.23 reais, the lowest since Aug. 10.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the state-run producer that
operates Ilha do Macuco, will continue drilling to reach two
additional prospects deeper under the seabed in the area, QGEP
said today. Rio de Janeiro-based QGEP has a 30 percent minority
stake in the license to explore the well.  The company has natural-gas production at the Manati
offshore field and is a minority partner with Petrobras at two
areas in deep waters of the Santos Basin, the location of
Brazil’s largest discoveries. It’s looking to expand in Brazil
and may buy assets Petrobras plans to sell, Chief Executive
Officer Jose Augusto Fernandes said Dec. 6.  Petrobras rose 0.6 percent to 24.72 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
