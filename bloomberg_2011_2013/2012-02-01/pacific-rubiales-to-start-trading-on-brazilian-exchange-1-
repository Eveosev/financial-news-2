Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) ,
Colombia’s second-largest oil producer, will begin trading
shares on  Brazil ’s stock exchange tomorrow.  The shares will be listed as Brazilian depositary receipts,
the company said in a statement today on the website of
Colombia’s securities regulator. The listing doesn’t imply
issuing shares, Rubiales said in a separate e-mailed statement.  Toronto-listed Pacific Rubiales, which was founded in 2008
after the merger of Pacific Stratus Energy Corp. and Petro
Rubiales Energy Corp., operates Colombia’s largest oil field and
has operations in Guatemala and Peru. The company had the
capacity to produce 251,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day in
2011, Pacific Rubiales said on its website.  Pacific Rubiales rose 0.7 percent to C$25.40 at noon in
Toronto trading. The shares have climbed 36 percent this year.  Ecopetrol SA is Colombia’s largest oil producer.  To contact the reporters on this story:
