CDON Group AB (CDON) , an online retailer of
fashion and media products, rose the most in over a month in
Stockholm after the company said profit almost doubled as it
expanded into new markets and added products.  The share rose 11 percent, the biggest jump since Dec. 20
last year, or 4.70 kronor to 46.90 kronor as of 1:48 p.m. local
time. The Malmoe, Sweden-based company was the biggest gainer in
the Stockholm All Share index.  CDON Group said net income rose 86 percent to 48.4 million
kronor ($7.2 million) while other retailers, such as  KappAhl
Holding AB (KAHL)  and  Clas Ohlson AB (CLASB) , have said in recent reports the
retail environment was weak. Sales rose 71 percent to 1.32
billion kronor as fashion site Nelly.com expanded to additional
European markets and were boosted by the acquisition of a 90.1
percent stake in brand furniture internet store Rum21 AB in
January last year, the company said today in a statement.  “Continued strong sales growth is key for CDON Group and
we can see that we have strong momentum in our business,” Chief
Executive Officer Paul Fischbein said. “CDON Group is currently
in an intense growth phase, with investments being made to
exploit this opportunity.”  Swedish broadcaster  Modern Times Group AB (MTGB)  spun off CDON in
December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
