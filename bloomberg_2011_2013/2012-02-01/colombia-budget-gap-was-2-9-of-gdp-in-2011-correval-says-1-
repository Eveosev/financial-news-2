Colombia ’s central government budget
deficit was 2.9 percent of gross domestic product last year,
less than the government’s December forecast of 3.2 percent,
Correval SA said.  The Andean nation’s consolidated budget deficit, which
includes states, municipalities and state-run companies, was 2.2
percent of GDP, compared with the government’s prior estimate of
2.9 percent, the Bogota-based brokerage said, citing a meeting
today between Finance Ministry officials and investors.  Officials from the ministry didn’t immediately answer calls
when contacted by Bloomberg.  The government “temporarily” suspended auctions of short-
term notes, known as TCOs, Correval said, citing the
unidentified officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
