Honda Motor Co. (7267)  ended eight months of
shrinking U.S. sales with an unexpected January gain as
recovering auto demand also buoyed growth for  Toyota Motor
Corp. (JDCSTYTA) ,  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  and  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380)   Honda yesterday posted an 8.8 percent increase from a year
earlier, compared with an average estimate of a 1.2 percent drop
in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts. Sales rose 7.5 percent at
Toyota,  Asia ’s largest automaker; 10 percent at Nissan; and 15
percent at Hyundai. Japanese and South Korean brands gained 13
percent, topping the industry’s 11 percent, Autodata Corp. said.  “Finally, Honda is getting back on its feet again,” said
Michelle Krebs, senior analyst at Edmunds.com, an automotive
pricing and data company in  Santa Monica ,  California .  Continued recovery in the  U.S. economy  combined with pent-
up consumer demand to replace aging vehicles pushed January
sales to a 14.2 million annualized rate, the highest since
August 2009 during the U.S. government’s cash-for-clunkers
trade-in program. The average age of U.S. cars and trucks has
risen to a record 10.8 years, according to R.L. Polk & Co.  “Some people are starting to feel comfortable enough in
the economy that they are willing to buy a car,” said Jim Hall,
principal of 2953 Analytics Inc., an auto consultant in
Birmingham, Michigan. “Others are saying, ‘I’ve got to replace
this old car because it’s nickel and diming me to death.’”  Camry Surge  Among U.S. carmakers, Chrysler Group LLC, majority owned by
 Fiat SpA (F) , had a 44 percent increase.  General Motors Co. (GM)  reported
a decline of 6.1 percent, better than the average estimate of a
7.3 percent drop from eight analysts, and  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s
light-vehicle sales rose 7.3 percent.  Toyota’s sales of Toyota, Lexus and Scion models rose to
124,540 vehicles last month from 115,856 a year earlier, aided
by a 56 percent jump for Camry sedans. The Toyota City, Japan-
based company’s increase exceeded the 7 percent average of six
analysts’ estimates.  “The Camry results could have been even better,” Bob Carter, Toyota’s group vice president of U.S. sales, said in a
conference call. The company didn’t anticipate that the Camry SE
version would sell as well as it has, he said.  Camry Production  “The Camry SE is bringing in new and younger buyers at
levels we have not previously experienced, with a median age of
45,” Carter said. To meet demand for the version, Toyota is
adjusting the production mix to more than 40 percent for the
Camry SE from 8 percent a year ago, he said.  Toyota’s market share declined to 13.6 percent in January
from 14.1 percent a year earlier, according to Autodata, an
industry researcher based in  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey.  Toyota’s American depositary receipts rose 2.3 percent to
$75.20 yesterday in  New York . Honda’s ADRs gained 3.4 percent to
$35.19, and Nissan’s advanced 2.2 percent to $19.22 in over-the-
counter trading in New York.  Honda, Japan’s third-largest automaker, said it sold 83,009
Honda and Acura vehicles, increasing from 76,269 a year earlier.
Deliveries rose 50 percent for the Civic small car, released
last year to mixed reviews, and 16 percent for the revamped
compact CR-V crossover.  The company’s U.S. sales had fallen every month starting in
May after production was disrupted by the March earthquake and
tsunami in Japan and by flooding in Thailand later in the year.  Honda Rebound  “Honda’s return to full strength on the manufacturing
front is already beginning to pay dividends on the sales
floor,”  John Mendel , the Tokyo-based automaker’s U.S. executive
vice president, said in a statement.  Honda’s market share was 9.1 percent in January, a drop of
0.2 percentage point from a year earlier, Autodata said.  Toyota and Honda may gain the most U.S. market share this
year, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts last week.
Buyers who are loyal to the brands put off purchases last year
while the companies dealt with production disruptions caused by
the natural disasters in  Japan  and Thailand.  Nissan’s sales rose to 79,313 Nissan and Infiniti vehicles
from 71,847 in January 2011. The gains were led by the mid-size
Altima sedan, Rogue compact crossovers and Quest minivans,  Al Castignetti , the Yokohama, Japan-based company’s vice president
of U.S. sales, said in a telephone interview yesterday.  Dealer Traffic  Easier access to new-vehicle loans and pent-up consumer
demand should extend sales gains throughout 2012, he said.  “Starting in the fourth quarter of 2011 and running into
January, the sheer volume of traffic at dealers is way up,”
Castignetti said.  Nissan’s January market share was 8.7 percent, compared
with 8.8 percent a year earlier, according to Autodata.  Hyundai, South Korea’s largest automaker, sold 42,694 new
vehicles, compared with 37,214 a year earlier. The Seoul-based
company benefited from increased deliveries of Sonata sedans,
Tucson crossovers and the new Veloster hatchback.  Kia Motors Corp. (000270) , Hyundai’s affiliate, reported a 28
percent increase to 35,517 vehicles, as sales of Optima sedans
more than doubled.  Combined sales for Hyundai and Kia, which operate
separately, climbed 20 percent to 78,211. That beat the 18
percent average estimate of four analysts.  Combined market share for the two companies rose to 8.6
percent from 7.9 percent, Autodata said.  Korean Challenge  “It will be a challenge for the Korean brands to keep
their momentum in this competitive marketplace,” said Krebs,
the Edmunds analyst.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261)  had a 68 percent sales surge in January,
led by an 83 percent increase in of Mazda3 compact cars. The
Hiroshima, Japan-based company has promoted the model, that gets
40 miles per gallon in highway driving, heavily in television
and web-based commercials.  Subaru, the auto brand of  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270) , said
sales rose 21 percent last month. Among smaller brands,
 Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211) ’s deliveries fell 18 percent and  Suzuki
Motor Corp. (7269)  had a 41 percent decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
