Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)  (5406),  Japan ’s fourth-
largest steelmaker, cut its annual profit forecast to a loss for
the first time in three years as a slower global economy and a
stronger yen reduced exports.  The steelmaker may post a loss of 10 billion yen ($131.2
million) for the year ending March 31, compared with its Oct. 31
estimate for a 20 billion-yen profit, the Kobe, Japan-based
company said in a statement today. That compares with a mean
profit estimate of 17.7 billion yen in a survey of 17 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg.  The European sovereign-debt crisis has cut demand for steel
in countries as earnings at Japanese mills are being squeezed by
a strong yen. Kobe Steel today lowered its full-year production
target by 2.7 percent to 7.2 million metric tons.  “The business environment is becoming tougher with slowing
overseas economies and a yen that stays high,” Executive Vice
President Hiroaki Fujiwara told reporters in  Tokyo  today.  The company today reported a third-quarter  loss  of 4.7
billion yen, its first in seven quarters. It forecast the loss
will widen by almost five times to 22.6 billion yen in the
January-to-March period after cutting domestic prices.  The shares fell 1.6 percent to 123 yen on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, compared with the 0.1 percent gain in the benchmark
Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Kobe Steel has  dropped  40 percent in
the past year.  Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) , Japan’s largest steelmaker, last month
cut its full-year profit target to zero.  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , the
second-biggest, forecast its first annual loss since it was
created from the merger of Kawasaki Steel Corp. and NKK Corp. in
2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
