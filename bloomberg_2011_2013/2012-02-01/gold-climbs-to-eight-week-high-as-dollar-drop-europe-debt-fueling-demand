Gold futures in New York climbed to
the highest price in almost eight weeks as  Europe ’s lingering
debt crisis and a weaker dollar spurred demand for the precious
metal as an alternative asset.  The  dollar  fell as much as 0.8 percent against a basket of
six currencies. Gold jumped 11 percent last month, the biggest
January gain since 1983, on mounting concern that Europe’s debt
woes may lead to a recession, and after the  Federal Reserve 
pledged to keep its benchmark U.S. interest rate low until at
least late 2014 to spur growth.  “Gold is trading like a hard currency,” James Dailey, who
manages $215 million at TEAM Financial Management LLC in
Harrisburg,  Pennsylvania , said in an e-mail. “People are
worried about currency debasement because of the credit easing
by several countries.”  Gold futures for April delivery gained 0.5 percent to
settle at $1,749.50 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the highest closing level since Dec. 2. Earlier, the price
touched $1,754, the highest since Dec. 8. The metal has gained
31 percent in the past year.  Bullion may reach $2,000 by the fourth quarter, up from a
first-quarter estimate of $1,850, analysts at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch said today in an e-mailed report.  Gold climbed 10 percent in 2011, an 11th consecutive annual
gain, reaching a record $1,923.70 in September, as investors
sought to diversify from equities and some currencies.  Silver futures for March delivery rose 1.6 percent to
$33.807 an ounce in New York. Yesterday, the price touched
$34.13, the highest since Nov. 16.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
April delivery advanced 2.2 percent to $1,623.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for March delivery rose 1.5 percent to $696.70
an ounce, rising for the first time in four sessions.  To contact the reporter for this story:
