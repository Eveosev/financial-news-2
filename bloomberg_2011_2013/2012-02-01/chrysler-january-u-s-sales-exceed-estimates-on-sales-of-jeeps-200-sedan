Chrysler Group LLC,  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) 
and  Kia Motors Corp. (000270)  led gains in January U.S. auto sales, while
Honda Motor Co. increased deliveries for the first time since
April as consumers replaced aging vehicles.  Chrysler’s U.S. sales increase of 44 percent surpassed
eight analysts’ average estimate for a 32-percent sales gain.
Affiliates Hyundai and Kia, based in  Seoul , sold a combined
78,211 vehicles in January, a 20 percent increase. Honda boosted
deliveries 8.8 percent, topping six analysts’ estimates for a
1.2 percent decline.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and Nissan Motor Co.
also reported gains from a year earlier, and  General Motors Co. (GM) 
posted a smaller decline than analysts estimated. The light-
vehicle seasonally adjusted annualized rate was 14.2 million,
the fastest since the “cash for clunkers” government incentive
program in August 2009. The average estimate of 14 analysts for
a 13.4 million  rate , up from 12.7 million a year earlier.  “Some people are starting to feel comfortable enough in
the economy that they are willing to buy a car,” said  Jim Hall ,
principal of 2953 Analytics Inc., an automotive consulting firm
in Birmingham,  Michigan . “Others are saying, ‘I’ve got to
replace this old car because it’s nickel and diming me to
death.’”  With the average age of U.S. cars and trucks rising to a
record 10.8 years, according to R.L. Polk & Co., analysts see
pent-up demand bolstering sales in January and boosting
deliveries to a third straight annual gain, the longest streak
since U.S. sales peaked in 2000. An improving  job market  and
available credit may drive up full-year sales more than 6
percent to 13.6 million, the average of 18 analysts’ estimates.  Chrysler, Hyundai-Kia  Chrysler, the automaker majority owned by Fiat SpA, sold
101,149 cars and light trucks last month, up from 70,118 a year
earlier, the  Auburn Hills , Michigan-based company said in a news
release. Hyundai and Kia topped the 18 percent sales gain that
was the average estimate of four analysts.  Honda,  Japan ’s third-largest automaker, snapped an eight-
month streak of sales declines from a year earlier, boosting
deliveries by 8.8 percent, according to an e-mailed statement.
The Tokyo-based company was expected to report a 1.2 percent
decline, the average of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales were buoyed by a 50 percent increase in deliveries of
Civic compact cars.  GM’s deliveries fell 6.1 percent to 167,962, the Detroit-
based automaker said. That beat the 7.3 percent decline
estimated by eight analysts. Buyers paid about $30,400 per GM
vehicle in January, up about $1,000 from a year earlier,  Jim Cain , a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  GM’s Incentives  GM incentive spending slid by about $700 per vehicle, Cain
said. The automaker outspent the industry average by 42 percent
in January 2011, according to  Woodcliff Lake , New Jersey-based
Autodata.  “When the incentives are down and sales are up, it clearly
indicates the product is selling itself,”  Jesse Toprak , an
analyst at  Santa Monica , California-based auto-pricing
researcher TrueCar.com, said in a phone interview. “That’s the
way it’s supposed to happen in a healthy market environment. The
underlying consumer demand continues to improve and prospects
for the economy are looking better now than a year ago.”  Ford’s sales of light vehicles increased 7.3 percent to
136,294 in January from 126,981 a year earlier, the automaker
said today. The average estimate of eight analysts’ surveyed by
Bloomberg was for a 7.9 percent rise.  Ford Models  Sales of Ford’s Focus compact car rose 60 percent to
14,400, while its Fiesta subcompact and Fusion family sedan
fell. The Escape small sport-utility vehicle rose 24 percent to
17,259 models, Ford said.  GM rose 1.5 percent to $24.37 at the close in  New York .
Ford fell 0.7 percent to $12.33.  Nissan’s January sales increased 10 percent to 79,313 cars
and trucks, topping the 7.6 percent average estimate of six
analysts.  Toyota sales rose 7.5 percent last month to 124,540 cars
and light trucks.  Asia ’s largest automaker exceeded the average
of six analysts’ estimates for a 7 percent increase. The gain
was led by a 56 percent jump in sales of Camry sedans.  “We’ve sold down to the asphalt for a number of months at
my Toyota store,” Gordon Stewart, who also owns four Chevrolet
dealerships and has outlets in four states, said in a phone
interview. “Given the blowout sales we had in December, we
lowered our expectations for January. But we still managed to
eke out of good month in January and that’s very promising.”  200, Durango  At Chrysler, models such as the 200 sedan, its top-selling
car last year, and the Dodge Durango SUV first arrived at
dealerships a year ago. Deliveries of the 200 surged to 7,007 in
January from 788 a year ago and Durango more than doubled to
3,021 from 1,199. Jeep brand sales climbed 37 percent to 31,710
led by the Grand Cherokee and Wrangler SUVs. Ram sales rose 47
percent to 17,909.  “We’re looking at a completely revamped lineup from
Chrysler that’s still kicking in, with a lot of models coming up
on their first full year of production,” Alec Gutierrez, an
analyst for Kelley Blue Book, said in a phone interview before
results were disclosed. “A year ago, Chrysler didn’t quite have
the product they needed to drive sales.”  Chrysler earned $225 million in net income in the fourth
quarter, the company said earlier today, exceeding the $186
million average of four analysts’ estimates. Net income may rise
to about $1.5 billion in 2012 as global revenue climbs 18
percent to $65 billion, the U.S. company said. It emerged from a
government-financed bankruptcy in 2009 under  Fiat (F)  management.  Volkswagen AG (VOW3) , which is targeting U.S. sales growth of more
than 10 percent this year, increased combined U.S. sales of its
Volkswagen and Audi brands by 39 percent last month from a year
earlier. The average of three analysts’ estimates was for a 27
percent gain.  Volkswagen plans to sell more than 500,000 cars in the U.S.
this year as part of the Wolfsburg, Germany-based automaker’s
goal to become the world’s biggest automaker by 2018.  To contact the reporters on this story:
