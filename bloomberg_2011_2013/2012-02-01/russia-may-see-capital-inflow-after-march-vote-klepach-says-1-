Russia will probably have net capital
inflows resume after the March presidential election, Deputy
Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  said.  Russia may show a net inflow in the second half, although
the result for the full year isn’t yet clear, Klepach told
reporters today in Moscow. While the ruble may continue to
appreciate in the “short term,” there are “no reasons for a
sharp change in the ruble’s trend,” he said.  The presidential election, contested by Prime Minister
 Vladimir Putin , will be held on March 4. The country’s net
outflow of capital more than doubled last year to $84.2 billion,
reaching the second-highest level since central bank records
began in 1994, Bank Rossii estimates.  Inflation this month probably won’t exceed the rate in
January, when it reached about 0.5 percent, according to
Klepach. The government will run a budget deficit of about 1
percent of gross domestic product, less than forecast, he
estimates.  Industrial production is slowing, with stagnation “very
probable” for manufacturers over the coming months, Klepach
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
