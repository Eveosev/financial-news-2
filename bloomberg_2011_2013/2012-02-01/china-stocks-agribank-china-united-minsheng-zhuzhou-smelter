Shares of the following companies had
 unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in parentheses
as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 24.53 points, or 1.1 percent, to
2,268.08. The  CSI 300 Index  declined 1.4 percent to 2,428.99.  Banking stocks:  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  (601288
CH), the nation’s fourth largest by assets, fell 0.7 percent to
2.68 yuan. China Merchants Bank Co. (600036 CH) lost 1.4 percent
to 12.47 yuan.  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016)  (600016 CH), the
nation’s first privately owned bank, dropped 2 percent to 6.29
yuan.  Total bank lending in the first 28 days of January may be
750 billion yuan ($118.9 billion) to 800 billion yuan, the 21st
Century Business Herald reported today, citing an unidentified
person. New loans exceeded 1 trillion yuan in every January over
the past three years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China United Network Communications Ltd. (600050)  (600050 CH), which
controls the nation’s second-largest cell phone operator, fell
1.2 percent to 4.82 yuan, its lowest close since Aug. 24. China
United had its recommendation cut to “neutral” at Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co. because the company’s capital spending may
exceed estimates amid a rapid increase in 3G subscribers, Wang Jing, an analyst at the brokerage wrote in a report today. The
previous rating was “outperform,” according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Nanjing Pharmaceutical Co. (600713)  (600713 CH), a Chinese
distributor and producer of medicines, lost 2 percent to 3.89
yuan, its lowest close since Jan. 16. Nanjing Pharmaceutical
said it would post a 2011 net loss because of higher  interest
rates  on loans and after the results of some of its business
adjustments failed to meet expectations.  Zhuzhou Smelter Group Co. (600961)  (600961 CH), China’s biggest
producer of refined zinc, slid 2.7 percent to 9.96 yuan. Net
loss for 2011 may total about 590 million yuan, Zhuzhou Smelter
estimated in a statement yesterday. That compares with profit of
17.5 million yuan in the year-earlier period, according to the
statement.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
