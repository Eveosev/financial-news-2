Construction spending in the U.S. rose
in December at the fastest pace in four months, reflecting broad-
based gains that signal the industry is stabilizing.  Building outlays  increased  1.5 percent, the biggest gain
since August, Commerce Department figures showed today in
Washington. The  median  estimate of 51 economists in a Bloomberg
survey called for a 0.5 percent rise.  A housing market that is gaining some steam as builders
begin apartment projects may breathe life into the industry
that’s struggled since triggering the recession in 2007. At the
same time, decreased spending by the government may temper
progress in construction as a whole.  “There are certainly bright spots for the construction
outlook,”  Michelle Meyer , a senior U.S. economist at Bank of
America Corp. in  New York , said before the report. “Multifamily
construction will continue to improve given the ongoing shift
from owning to renting and the lack of supply in the market. It
will still be a very slow healing process.”  Estimates (CNSTTMOM)  in the Bloomberg survey ranged from a drop of 0.6
percent to an increase of 1.5 percent. The Commerce Department
revised the November reading down to a 0.4 percent gain from a
previously estimated increase of 1.2 percent.  A report today from ADP Employer Services showed companies
added 170,000 workers to payrolls in January, reflecting job
gains in services and at small businesses. The increase followed
a 292,000 gain the prior month.  Construction outlays were down 2 percent in December from
the same time in 2010, before adjusting for seasonal variations.  Private Construction  Private construction spending rose 2.1 percent in December
from the prior month, the biggest gain since May. The increase
brought the value up to $529.7 billion at an annual rate, the
highest level since December 2009.  Homebuilding outlays  increased 0.8 percent, including a 0.2
percent increase in home improvement. Non-residential building
climbed 3.3 percent.  Spending on public construction advanced 0.5 percent, the
report said. Federal construction spending increased 0.3 percent.  The homebuilding industry is trying to recover from record-
low traffic last year. About 302,000 new homes were sold in the
U.S. in 2011, the worst year in data dating to 1963, Commerce
Department figures showed Jan. 26.  Housing starts fared better, growing by 3.4 percent last
year to the highest level since 2008. The strength came from work
on multifamily dwellings, which jumped as more Americans opted to
rent rather than own. Conversely, single-family home construction
in 2011 was the weakest in records going back to 1959.  Housing Starts  The market may be beginning to stabilize. Builders broke
ground on 470,000 single-family houses at an annual rate in
December, the  most  since April 2010, the Commerce Department said
Jan. 19. Residential construction added 0.23 percentage point to
gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, the largest
contribution since the April-June period of 2010.  Home sales and construction will improve in 2012, adding
“modestly” to economic growth, according to a  Fannie Mae 
forecast last month. Sales of new and existing homes are likely
to increase 3.5 percent, and housing starts are projected to rise
16 percent, the group’s chief economist said Jan. 13.  Homebuilder sentiment has also ticked up. The National
Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo sentiment index  rose  in
January to the highest level since June 2007 as sales and buyer
traffic improved.  “Although macroeconomic and housing conditions remain soft,
we are cautiously optimistic for the remainder for 2012,” Donald Tomnitz, chief executive officer of  Fort Worth , Texas-based D.R.
Horton Inc., said in a Jan. 27 conference call. “Simply put, our
business feels more positive.”  The largest U.S homebuilder by volume reported net home
orders that rose to 3,794 in final three months of 2011 from
3,363 a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
