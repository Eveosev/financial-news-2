OAO Gazprom (OGZPY) , the world’s biggest
producer of natural gas, rose the most in a week in U.S. trading
after Renaissance Capital said the company vowed to reduce
investment spending and as cold weather returned to  Europe ,
spurring demand for the fuel.  American depositary receipts advanced 1.9 percent to $12.28
in New York, after reaching a three-month high of $12.40
earlier.  The stock  in Moscow gained 0.9 percent to 185.70
rubles, or $6.16. One depositary receipt is equal to two
ordinary shares. The  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index  of Russian
companies traded in New York rose 2.2 percent.  “Gazprom vowed to cut their investment program by 35
percent during their conference call with investors today,”
Ilya Balabanovsky, an analyst at  Renaissance Capital  in Moscow,
said via telephone. “The market could read this a sign of
improvement in capital discipline, which could raise free cash
flow generation and potentially lead to further dividend
increases. A return of cold weather in Europe could also help
the market’s sentiment.”  Colder-than-normal weather across Europe, where Gazprom
supplies about 25 percent of the gas market, has led customers
to seek more fuel. Temperatures may fall to 4 degrees Celsius
(39 degrees Fahrenheit) in  Rome  tomorrow and to minus 13 degrees
in Prague, according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  Gazprom sells about 30 percent of its gas output to Europe.
Renaissance Capital estimates the price of gas sold by Gazprom
to European customers in 2011 was at an average $400 per 1,000
cubic meters, compared with an average $90 it charged Russian
domestic customers in 2011, Balabanovsky said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
