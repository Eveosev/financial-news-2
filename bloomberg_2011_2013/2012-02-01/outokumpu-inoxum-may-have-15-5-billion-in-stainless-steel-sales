Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V) ’s purchase of
 ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) ’s stainless steel unit will establish the
world’s leading producer of the alloy with 11.8 billion euros
($15.5 billion) in projected sales, the companies said.  The combination of Outokumpu with Inoxum will create a
business with 14 percent market share and delivery volumes of
3.5 million metric tons, Outokumpu Chief Executive Officer Mika Seitovirta said today. It will have 19,000 employees.  The deal is “transformational for Outokumpu” as it
strengthens the company financially, broadens its customer base
and gives it access to a global distribution network, Seitovirta
said at a news conference with ThyssenKrupp Chief Executive
Officer Heinrich Hiesinger in Dusseldorf,  Germany .  Outokumpu will cut 1,500 positions globally and reduce
production overcapacities as it seeks to unlock cost synergies
of between 225 million euros and 250 million euros a year by
2017. The new company targets rising sales in  Asia , the fastest-
growing stainless steel market, shifting a focus that has been
“too Eurocentric,” Seitovirta said.  The companies expect the transaction to conclude by year-
end. Outokumpu is “confident” it will get antitrust approval
from European authorities for the deal that values the German
company at about 2.7 billion euros, Seitovirta said.  Outokumpu rose 3.5 percent, to 6.49 euros a share, at the
5:30 p.m. close in Helsinki today, erasing a 14 percent intraday
loss after giving the sales outlook for the new company. The
company said today will omit a dividend payout for the first
time since at least 1992 after reporting its fourth consecutive
annual loss.  ThyssenKrupp rose 3.2 percent, to 22.355 euros a share, at
the close in  Frankfurt .  To contact the reporter on this story:
