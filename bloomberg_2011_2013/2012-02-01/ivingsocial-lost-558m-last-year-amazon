Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , a backer of
LivingSocial, said the daily-deal startup had more than $500
million in losses last year and pegged its stake at $208
million, implying the company’s book value is $671 million.  LivingSocial posted revenue of $245 million in 2011, with
$686 million in operating expenses, according to  a regulatory
filing . Amazon said it owns a 31 percent stake in LivingSocial,
the main competitor to Groupon Inc. in the online-coupon market.  The daily-deal site previously lined up $400 million in
funding at a valuation of about $6 billion, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said in December. LivingSocial delivers
discounts on restaurants, hotels, events, and other goods and
services, a market that may generate $4.17 billion in U.S. sales
in 2015, up from $1.97 billion last year, according to research
firm BIA/Kelsey in Chantilly, Virginia.  Groupon shares dropped as much as 24 percent below its IPO
price in November on concern that profit margins will be
squeezed by surging marketing costs and competition from rivals.
The stock is now trading at 7.5 percent more than its offering
price.  Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, invested $175
million in  Washington , D.C.-based LivingSocial in December 2010.
The company valued the stake at $192 million in the third
quarter.  Mary Osako, a spokeswoman for Seattle-based Amazon,
declined to comment beyond the information in the filing.
Amazon’s shares fell 7.7 percent today after its sales missed
analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
