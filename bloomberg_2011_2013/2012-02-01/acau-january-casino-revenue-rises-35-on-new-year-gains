Casino revenue in  Macau , the world’s
largest gambling hub, rose 35 percent in January, beating
analyst estimates as Chinese tourists spent more during the
Lunar New Year holiday.  Revenue at casinos in Macau, the only place in China where
they are legal, jumped 35 percent to 25 billion patacas ($3.13
billion) in January, according to data from Macau’s Gaming
Inspection and Coordination Bureau. That was higher than the
median estimate of 24 billion patacas from seven analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News.  “Better infrastructure is drawing more Chinese tourists to
Macau, benefiting the whole industry,” said Gary Pinge, an
analyst at Macquarie Securities Ltd. He predicts slower growth
from February as high-stake gamblers find it harder to raise
credit.  Chinese gamblers have fueled growth in the former
Portuguese colony, where gambling sales have more than tripled
in the past four years.  Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , the world’s
biggest casino company by market value, made 60 percent of its
 revenue  in Macau in 2010 after opening its first location in the
city in 2004.  Visitors to locations belonging to  Sands China Ltd. (1928) , Asia’s
biggest casino operator by market value, rose by 5 percent to 6
percent to more than 1 million during the Lunar New Year holiday
from Jan. 23 to Jan. 29, the company said on Jan. 30.  Sands China, the Hong Kong-listed unit of billionaire
Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas-based company, climbed 0.8 percent
to HK$26.45 at the close in  Hong Kong  trading.  SJM Holdings
Ltd. (880) , Asia’s biggest casino company founded by billionaire
 Stanley Ho , gained 2 percent to HK$14.16.  MGM China Holdings Ltd. advanced 0.9 percent,  Galaxy
Entertainment Group Ltd. (27)  jumped 1.8 percent, Wynn Macau Ltd.
moved 0.2 percent higher and Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd.
gained 1.4 percent. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  dipped 0.3
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
