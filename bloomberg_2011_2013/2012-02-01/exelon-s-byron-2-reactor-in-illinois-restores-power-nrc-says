Exelon Corp. (EXC) , the largest U.S.
utility holding company, restored offsite power to the Byron 2
reactor in  Illinois  that was knocked out two days ago by
electrical equipment failure.  The plant, 85 miles (137 kilometers) west of  Chicago , where
Exelon is based, ended an “unusual event,” the lowest of four
federal emergency classification levels, at 8 p.m. local time
yesterday, according to a filing to the  Nuclear Regulatory
Commission . Diesel generators being used to power the site were
switched off, it showed.  Crews replaced a line insulator that failed in the
switchyard of the 1,136-megawatt Byron 2 reactor, knocking out
offsite power, at 10:18 a.m. on Jan. 30, Paul Dempsey, a company
spokesman, said in a telephone interview yesterday.  The plant vented steam containing tritium to relieve
pressure in the reactor until 3 a.m. local time yesterday, he
said. There was no impact on the safety of employees or the
public, he said.  Another unit at the plant, the 1,164-megawatt Byron 1, is
operating at full capacity.  Krista Lopykinski, a spokeswoman at the plant, didn’t
immediately reply to an e-mail today before regular business
hours seeking comment.  Tritium is a naturally occurring radioactive form of
hydrogen that is produced in the upper atmosphere and falls to
the ground in rain water,  according  to the NRC. It is also a
byproduct of nuclear plants, a weak type of radiation that
doesn’t penetrate the skin, the federal agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
