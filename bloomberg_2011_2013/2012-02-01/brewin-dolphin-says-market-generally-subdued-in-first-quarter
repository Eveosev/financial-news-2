Brewin Dolphin Holdings Plc (BRW) , a U.K.
stockbroker and fund manager, said commission income fell 24
percent in its fiscal first quarter as the market was
“generally subdued.”  Commission income dropped to 17.6 million pounds ($27.8
million) in the 13 weeks ending Dec. 31 from the year-earlier
period, the London-based company said today in a statement. The
trend “continued into January,”  Brewin Dolphin  said. First-
quarter revenue rose 0.8 percent to 59.7 million pounds.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
