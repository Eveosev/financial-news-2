Temasek Holdings Pte (TMSK) , Singapore’s
state-owned investment company, said Hsieh Fu Hua is stepping
down from the board four months after he left his post as
president.  The former chief executive officer of  Singapore Exchange
Ltd. (SGX)  will retain his positions as chairman of Fullerton Fund
Management Company Ltd., ST Asset Management Ltd. and the
Stewardship and Corporate Governance Centre, which is backed by
the investment firm, Temasek said in a response to queries.
Hsieh relinquished his executive position at the end of
September “to make room for personal priorities,” Temasek said.  Temasek has faced changes at the top since the middle of
2009, when it parted ways with former BHP Billiton Ltd. head
Charles “Chip” Goodyear, who was going to replace  Ho Ching  as
CEO, over differences in strategy.  Simon Israel , also a former
Temasek executive director and president, retired from his
executive and board roles in July.  The firm, which managed S$193 billion ($154 billion) as of
March 31, named Hsieh as president in 2010, along with  Israel 
and Gregory Curl, once a candidate for CEO of Bank of America
Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
