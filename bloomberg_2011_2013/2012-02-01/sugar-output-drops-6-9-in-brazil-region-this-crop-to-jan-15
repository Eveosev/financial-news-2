Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, fell 6.9 percent in
the current crop year through Jan. 15, industry association
Unica said.  Output fell to 31.2 million metric tons from 33.5 million
tons a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Unica said in an e-mailed
statement today. The volumes were little-changed from those
reported previously because most harvesting for the crop year
that started on March 1 ended in December.  Growers in the Center South, where about 90 percent of
Brazil’s sugar and ethanol is produced, reaped 492.7 million
tons of cane in the period, down 11 percent from a year earlier.  Ethanol output declined 19 percent to 20.6 billion liters
(5.4 billion gallons), Unica said. Mills turned 48.3 percent of
the cane into sugar and the rest into fuel. That compares with
45 percent a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
