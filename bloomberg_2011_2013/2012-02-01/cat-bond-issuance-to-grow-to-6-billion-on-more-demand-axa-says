Axa SA (CS) ,  Europe ’s second-biggest
insurer, said total issuance of bonds designed to protect
insurers from the risk of paying out on natural disasters could
increase by 30 percent to $6 billion this year.  “More new sponsors are coming to the market” looking for
an alternative for reinsurance, while insurers issue more of
these catastrophe bonds to raise capital after a year of heavy
losses from natural disasters, Christophe Fritsch, head of
insurance-linked securities at Axa Investment Managers, said in
an interview in Bern,  Switzerland .  The amount of catastrophe bonds outstanding may expand to
$14.5 billion in 2012, from about $13.6 billion this year,
according to Swiss Re Capital Markets, a unit of the world’s
second-biggest reinsurer. Cat bonds returned 6.2 percent since
April 1, after dropping 4 percent following the March earthquake
in  Japan , the  Swiss Re Global Cat Bond Performance Total Return
Index (SRGLTRR)  shows.  Institutional investors including pension funds, Fritsch’s
main clients who buy cat-bond funds, receive an average return
of 7 percent, largely insulated from macroeconomic or financial-
market developments, Fritsch said. Meanwhile, they risk losing
some or all of their money if a catastrophe occurs.  Fritsch has headed a team of four portfolio managers in
Paris since 2008 and manages about $300 million in insurance-
linked assets through two funds. Axa Investment Managers is the
asset-management unit of Paris-based Axa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
