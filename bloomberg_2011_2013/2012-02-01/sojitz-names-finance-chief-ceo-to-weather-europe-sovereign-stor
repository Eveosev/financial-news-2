Sojitz Corp. (2768) , the smallest of Japan’s
six major commodity suppliers, named finance chief Yoji Sato as
president and chief executive officer to help weather the debt
crisis in  Europe .  “When you have to deal with the sovereign debt crisis in
Europe and the issue of a very strong yen, it’s best that the
CFO, who is a specialist in the financial field, as well as
having experience of two postings in the U.S., takes charge,”
outgoing CEO Yutaka Kase told reporters in  Tokyo  today. Kase
will become chairman, with the changes effective April 1.  Sato, a 39-year veteran of the trading house, takes over a
company that has focused on rare earths investments and energy
to boost earnings. The company’s shares have slumped  78 percent 
since reaching a peak on July 20, 2007.  Sato, 62, owns $152,529 worth of shares in Sojitz, which
has climbed 11 percent since the start of the year on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sojitz’s operating profit for the three months through
December jumped 38 percent to 38.6 billion yen ($508 million),
the company said today. The net loss for the period was 13.5
billion yen due to a change in Japan’s corporate tax rate, the
company said.  Sojitz on Dec. 9 forecast an annual net loss of 12 billion
yen for the year ending March 31 because of the tax change.
Sales and operating profit wouldn’t be affected, the company
said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
