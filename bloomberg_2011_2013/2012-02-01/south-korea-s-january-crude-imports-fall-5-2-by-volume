South Korea , the world’s fifth-
largest oil importer, purchased 5.2 percent less crude last
month, the first decline since August.  Crude  imports  fell to 79.9 million barrels from 84.3
million a year earlier, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said
in an e-mailed statement today, without giving reasons for the
drop. The country’s import bill gained 18 percent to $9 billion
as prices rose 24 percent to $112.8 a barrel, the  ministry  said.  South Korea, which imports almost all of its oil needs,
urged companies and individuals in November to save energy in
winter, including cutting back on heating. The country’s large
companies, using 30 percent of the nation’s electricity, pledged
to cut consumption by 5 percent a year after South Korea imposed
rolling blackouts in September for the first time since 2001.  Natural gas import costs fell 18 percent to $2.66 billion
in January, while coal costs gained 24 percent to $1.64 billion,
according to the ministry.  South Korea’s oil-product exports rose 40 percent to $4.35
billion, the ministry said, citing values for the first 20 days
of the month. Shipments to  China  almost doubled, followed by a
35 percent gain in exports to  Southeast Asia  and a 14 percent
increase to  Japan . Shipments to the U.S. and European Union
dropped 25 percent and 91 percent, respectively.  Petrochemical exports fell 3 percent to $3.4 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
