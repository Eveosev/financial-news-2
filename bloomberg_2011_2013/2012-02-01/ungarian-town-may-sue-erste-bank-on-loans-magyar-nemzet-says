The Hungarian city of
Hodmezovasarhely will probably sue the Hungarian unit of  Erste
Group Bank (EBS)  AG because of a dispute on sharing losses on the
town’s foreign-currency debt,  Magyar Nemzet  reported, citing
Mayor Janos Lazar.  The town asked the bank to share the burden on Swiss franc-
denominated loans currently worth 14 billion forint ($62
million), and the lender responded that the municipality should
pay back 10 billion forint in a lump sum as a precondition for a
deal, the newspaper said.  Lazar, who is also the head of the ruling Fidesz party’s
parliamentary group, will seek permission to start a lawsuit
against the Erste bank unit to determine how much of the
exchange-rate loss should be taken by the bank, Magyar Nemzet
said.  Katalin Banhegyi, a Budapest-based spokeswoman for Erste,
declined to comment on the report when contacted by Bloomberg
by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
