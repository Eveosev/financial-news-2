The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission should double the threshold of owners a company can
have before being forced to register with the regulator,
according to recommendations from the SEC’s small-business
advisory group.  The committee voted today in  Washington  to recommend the
threshold be raised from 500 to 1,000. The group also
recommended raising the dollar limit for so-called Regulation A
public offerings from $5 million a year to $50 million before
SEC registration is triggered. Though the committee also
considered advising the SEC to consider allowing crowdfunding --
the soliciting and pooling of small investments, often online --
it postponed that vote because of concerns about limiting
possible fraud.  “Your ideas continue to be an extremely important addition
to the process and to our thinking,” said SEC Chairman  Mary Schapiro  before the votes. She said the recommendations “will
become an important part of the work” of the staff.  After President  Barack Obama  directed federal agencies last
year to ensure their rules promote economic growth while using
the least burdensome tools to achieve regulatory ends, Schapiro
asked her staff to review rules to relieve burdens on smaller
companies. The House has passed parallel legislation, while
senators have introduced similar measures and tried to attach
them as amendments to bills on the Senate floor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
