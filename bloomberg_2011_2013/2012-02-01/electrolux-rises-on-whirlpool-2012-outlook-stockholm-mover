Electrolux AB (ELUXB) , the world’s second-
biggest appliance maker, was the top gainer on the  OMX Stockholm
30 Index (OMX)  after U.S. competitor  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)  predicted a
higher-than-expected full-year profit.  Electrolux, which trails Whirlpool in sales, rose as much
as 4.6 percent and was up 4.3 percent at 130 kronor as of 4:00
p.m. local time. Shares in Stockholm-based Electrolux have
climbed 16 percent this year, outperforming the 5.5 percent
increase for the  OMX Stockholm 30 Index  and valuing the company
at 40.3 billion kronor ($5.98 billion).  “It’s very significant that Whirlpool is talking about a
positive development,”  James Moore , an analyst at Redburn
Partners LLP in London who recommends investors buy Electrolux’s
stock, said by phone today. “It looks increasingly likely
there’s a real consumer recovery in the U.S.”  Whirlpool, based in  Benton Harbor , Michigan, advanced in
New York after the company projected full-year earnings that
exceeded analysts’ estimates. The share increased 10 percent to
$59.92. Cost reductions and price increases “positively
impacted” the results last quarter, the company said today in a
statement.  Whirlpool predicted full-year profit of as much as $7 a
share, excluding restructuring expenses and Brazilian tax
credits. Analysts projected $5.80, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Net income in the quarter ended Dec. 31
rose to $205 million, or $2.62 a share, from $171 million, or
$2.19 a year earlier.  Electrolux is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings
on Feb 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
