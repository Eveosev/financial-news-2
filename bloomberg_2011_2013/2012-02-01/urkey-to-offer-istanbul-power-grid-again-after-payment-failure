Turkey  will reschedule the sale of an
electricity distribution grid covering the European side of
Istanbul after the companies winning an original auction failed
to make downpayments.  The sale was canceled as three Turkish bidders -- Park
Holding AS, Aksa Elektrik Perakende Satis AS and MMEKA Makina
Ithalat Pazarlama AS -- didn’t pay after bidding as much as $3
billion, an official at the asset sales agency in Ankara said on
the usual condition of anonymity. Park Holding, the third-
highest bidder, didn’t make a payment by a deadline yesterday.  Turkey is seeking buyers for 20 regional electricity
distribution networks to boost investment in the industry and
help reduce debt.  Enerjisa, owned by  Verbund AG (VER)  of Austria and  Haci Omer
Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL) , said on Dec. 30 it won’t take up an offer to
buy a grid on the Asian side of Istanbul after bidding $1.52
billion. The company cited the financial crisis in  Europe  as the
reason. Two higher bidders also dropped out.  To contact the reporter on this story:
