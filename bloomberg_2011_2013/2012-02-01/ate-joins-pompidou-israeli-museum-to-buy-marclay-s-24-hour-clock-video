Christian Marclay’s “The Clock”
will forever transform cinema time into real time as museums in
the U.K.,  Israel  and  France  jointly acquired the 24-hour film.  Israel Museum in Jerusalem spent a low six-figure sum to
jointly acquire the video collage with the Pompidou Center in
Paris and the Tate in  London .  “The Clock,” which is composed of thousands of film
images that include clocks, watches or announcements that
illuminate the passage of time, premiered in London in October
2010. The work drew about 3,500 visitors in the two days it ran
for a full 24 hours in Jerusalem and overall it attracted 
50,000 visitors.  “Given our commitment to contemporary art, this is a
signature acquisition for us,” said Israel Museum Director
James Snyder, who said the acquisition partners shared the cost
of the purchase equally. He declined to elaborate on the price
beyond the ballpark figure the museum paid.  Israel Museum acquired the piece with the help of the
Ostrovsky Family Fund. The joint acquisition means that
screenings will be coordinated among the partners so it is only
on view at one venue at a time.  Snyder said that had Israel Museum bought the work alone,
“it would have been the single largest acquisition of a video
work” ever acquired by the museum. He said that all copies of
the work sold for the same price.  To contact the writer on the story:
