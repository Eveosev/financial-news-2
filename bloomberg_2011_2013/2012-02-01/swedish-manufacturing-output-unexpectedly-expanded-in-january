Sweden’s manufacturing  unexpectedly
expanded for the first time in sixth months in January as
domestic demand boosted orders and production, a survey showed.  An index based on responses from about 200  purchasing
managers  rose to a seasonally adjusted 51.4 last month from 48.9
the previous month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which compiles
the index, said today. A reading above 50 signals an expansion.
The  average estimate  of 10 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
for the index to rise to 49.5.  “The increase in demand was primarily in the domestic
market,” Swedbank said in a statement.  Sweden ’s central bank in December cut its  benchmark lending
rate  by a quarter percentage point to 1.75 percent, predicting
the European debt crisis will hamper growth in the Nordic
country which relies on exports for about half its output. The
 economy  will grow 1.3 percent this year versus an earlier
forecast for 1.5 percent, the central bank said in December.  Swedbank’s index measuring new orders rose to 52 from 47,
while the production gauge increased to 52.9 from 49.2,
according to the survey. The delivery time index climbed to 51
from 49.9, the employment index decreased to 48 from 49.5 and
the inventory measure fell to 47 from 48.3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
