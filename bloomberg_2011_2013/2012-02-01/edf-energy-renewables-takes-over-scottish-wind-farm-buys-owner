EDF Energy Renewables Ltd. took over
a Scottish wind farm after the U.K. company bought the park’s
owner, North British Windpower Ltd. Terms weren’t disclosed.  EDF Energy Renewables bought the company owning the 144-
megawatt Fallago Rig project under development in the Scottish
Borders, according to a statement from Squire Sanders, the  law
firm  advising North British Windpower on the deal.  EDF Energy Renewables is a wind-focused joint venture
between EDF Energy Plc and  EDF Energies Nouvelles SA. (EEN)  The
project, already approved, is expected to power about 90,000
Scottish homes when built, according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
