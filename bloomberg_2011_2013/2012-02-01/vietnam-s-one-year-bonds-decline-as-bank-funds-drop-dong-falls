Vietnam ’s one-year government bonds
declined on speculation banks have less cash to invest in debt
following increased demand for funds during the weeklong new
year. The dong fell.  “Banks don’t have much cash to buy bonds now as liquidity
is still low after demand for cash increased during the Lunar
New Year Holiday,” said Vu Anh Duc, a Hanoi-based senior fixed-
income dealer at Vietnam Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for
Industry and Trade, also known as VietinBank.  The  yield  on the one-year notes rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 12.70 percent, according to daily
fixing prices from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 21,008 per dollar as of 4:30 p.m. local
time, compared with 21,018 yesterday, according to data from
banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank set the  reference rate  at 20,828 per
dollar, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on
either side of that rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
