OAO Transneft (TRNRP) ,  Russia ’s oil-pipeline
operator, plans to spend 18.6 billion rubles ($614 million)
through 2020 to buy, build and subsidize 422,400 square meters
of living space for its workers.  The Moscow-based company’s plan includes investment of 4.7
billion rubles during that period to build 92,400 square meters
of housing needed to support its pipeline construction projects
in remote areas, Transneft said in its strategic outlook
published today on its website.  The state-owned monopoly expects Russian crude exports to
grow 2.8 percent in 2012 to 243.7 million metric tons and to
rise 8 percent to 256 million metric tons by 2020. The company
intends to invest 356 billion rubles in its network by 2020,
according to the plan, which was approved by Transneft’s board
of directors on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
