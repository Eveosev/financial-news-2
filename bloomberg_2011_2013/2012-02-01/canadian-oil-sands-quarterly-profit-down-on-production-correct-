Canadian Oil Sands Ltd. (COS) , the largest
partner in Syncrude Canada Ltd., said fourth-quarter profit
declined 60 percent as Syncrude’s production fell and the
company paid higher taxes following its change to a corporation.  Net income dropped to C$232 million ($232 million), or 48
cents a share, from C$575 million, or C$1.19, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement today. Per-share
profit was 3 cents more than the 45 cent average of seven
analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Canadian Oil Sands had a C$70 million tax expense in the
fourth quarter compared with a gain of C$240 million in the same
period a year earlier because it changed from an investment
trust to a corporation under Canadian law at the end of 2010.
Taxable income had previously been sheltered by the income trust
structure.  Production at Syncrude in the fourth quarter fell to 23.2
million barrels from 29 million barrels a year earlier. Output
was cut because of an unplanned temporary shutdown of a hydrogen
unit, the company said.  Sales fell 3.1 percent to C$884 million. Operating expenses
rose 31 percent to C$46.88 a barrel from C$35.81 a year earlier,
according to the statement.  Canadian  Oil Sands  owns 36.74 percent of Syncrude, which
held an estimated 4.8 billion barrels of proved and probable
reserves at the end of 2010, according to its website. The other
venture partners include Imperial Oil Ltd., China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. and Nexen Inc.  The earnings were reported after the close of regular
trading on North American markets. Canadian Oil Sands was
unchanged at C$24.23 at 4:45 p.m. in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
