The Italian government’s economic
overhaul will allow the euro region’s third-biggest economy to
expand following years of “virtual stagnation,” a  Bank of
Italy  official said.  “Concrete and relevant steps toward the country’s
modernization are being taken through this decree,” Salvatore Rossi, the central bank’s deputy director general, told
lawmakers in  Rome  today, according to an e-mailed text. The
measures are needed to help “the Italian economy exit the
condition of virtual stagnation of the last 15 years.”  Italy may be in its fourth recession since 2001 after its
 gross domestic product  contracted in the third quarter of last
year. On Jan. 20, Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s Cabinet approved
a package of measures aimed at boosting economic growth and
spurring competition by opening up professions and streamlining
the country’s bureaucracy.  Italy’s economy has lagged behind the euro-area average in
the decade to 2010, growing an average of 0.2 percent annually
compared with 1.1 percent in the region. The  International
Monetary Fund  forecast in its World Economic Outlook Update on
Jan. 24 that the $2.3 trillion economy will contract 2.2 percent
this year and 0.6 percent next.  To contact the reporter on this story:
