China  National Offshore Oil Corp.,
the country’s biggest offshore energy explorer, posted slower
revenue growth last year following oil leaks and a failed
overseas acquisition.  Sales at the state-owned parent of  Cnooc (883)  Ltd. reached 480
billion yuan ($76.1 billion), Deputy General Manager Lv Bo told
reporters in Beijing yesterday. That’s a 35 percent increase
from 2010, Bloomberg calculations show. Revenue grew 78 percent
to $56.6 billion in 2010, according to the company last year.  Cnooc cut its output goal after spills shut the country’s
biggest offshore oilfield and a venture co-owned by the company
scrapped a $7.1 billion bid for BP Plc’s Argentine unit. Cnooc,
whose profit accounted for more than half of its parent’s in
2010, plans to boost  capital spending  by as much as 63 percent
this year to start new deepwater fields and acquire more assets.  The group’s output may double by the end of the decade
compared with 2010, and triple by 2030, China National Offshore
Chairman Wang Yilin said at a company event in Beijing yesterday,
without giving specific estimates.  China National Offshore produced 46.61 million metric tons
of oil last year, while natural gas output reached 16.7 billion
cubic meters, Wang said without providing comparative figures.
The group had a record profit in 2011, he said, without being
more specific.  Hong Kong-listed unit Cnooc has fallen 6.9 percent in the
past year, compared with a 14 percent decline in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index. (HSI)  The stock rose 3.6 percent to HK$16.56 as of
2:22 p.m. local time.  Deepwater Drilling  “The financial figures are largely in line,”  Gordon Kwan ,
head of energy research at Mirae Asset Securities Ltd. in  Hong
Kong , said by e-mail. “What got the market excited is the
potential for positive oil and gas discovery news flow next
month when they start drilling in China’s virgin deep waters.”  Cnooc, which relies on areas off China’s coast for 80
percent of its output, seeks to boost production this year by as
much as 2.7 percent to the equivalent of 330 million to 340
million barrels of oil.  China National Offshore is also the parent of Hong Kong-
listed  China Oilfield Services Ltd. (2883)   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
