     Feb. 1 (Bloomberg) --  Sharp Corp. (6753)  fell the most in almost
six months in Tokyo trading after the Nikkei newspaper reported
 Japan ’s largest liquid-crystal-display maker will cut TV panel
production by half for a month at its biggest factory.  Sharp  dropped  as much as 6 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since Aug. 9, to 617 yen, and traded at 643 yen as of
the 11:30 a.m. break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average gained 0.3 percent.  The company’s panel business recovery plan is “veering off
track,” Amir Anvarzadeh, Singapore-based manager of Asian
equity sales at BGC Partners Inc., wrote in a note to clients
today. BGC removed Sharp from its “buy” list, after adding it
Jan. 5.  The maker of Aquos televisions will halve output at its
factory in Sakai, Osaka prefecture for more than a month as
weakening global demand has caused inventories to rise, the
Nikkei newspaper reported today, without saying where it
obtained the information. Sharp isn’t the source for the report,
the Osaka-based company said today in a statement.  The television maker is scheduled to report third-quarter
earnings today.  Net loss will probably be 16.2 billion yen for the year
ending March 31, based on the average of 24 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with the company’s own
forecast for annual net income of 6 billion yen and profit of
19.4 billion yen in the previous year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
