Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the
government will support small companies with a 15 billion-yuan
($2.4 billion) fund as growth moderates in the world’s second-
largest economy.  China  will also extend preferential tax policies for small
companies until 2015 and will ask banks to increase tolerance of
bad loans to these businesses, according to a  statement  posted
on the central government’s website yesterday, citing a State
Council meeting presided by Wen.  “Supporting the healthy development of small and micro-
sized business is of significant strategic importance for
 China’s economy  to overcome the impact from the global financial
crisis and to maintain stable, relatively fast growth,”
according to the statement.  China’s economy grew 8.9 percent in the final three months
of 2011, the least in 10 quarters, as exports rose at a slower
pace and property curbs hurt output of products including steel
and cement. Expansion may cool to about 7.5 percent this quarter
and 7.6 percent in the three months through June until policies
to spur growth kick in, according to Nomura Holdings Inc.  The government has so far refrained from following Asian
nations including Thailand in lowering benchmark  interest rates 
and didn’t make a cut in bank-reserve requirements that
Industrial Bank Co. and Barclays Capital Asia Ltd. had forecast
for January.  China’s manufacturing expanded last month, according to the
official purchasing managers’ index, exceeding the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey for a contraction,
suggesting the country is withstanding  Europe ’s debt crisis and
a government-induced property slowdown at home.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
