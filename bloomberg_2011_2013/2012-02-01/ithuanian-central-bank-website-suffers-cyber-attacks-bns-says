The Lithuanian central bank’s  website 
was attacked for the second time in a week, the  Baltic News
Service  reported today, citing bank spokesman Giedrius
Simonavicius.  The bank suffered similar cyber attacks on Jan. 27 that
originated from Russia, Ukraine,  Switzerland , China, the U.S.
and Canada, the newswire said. The central bank’s online
services are now accessible for domestic users, while those
opening the website from abroad may encounter “temporary
glitches,” Simonavicius was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
