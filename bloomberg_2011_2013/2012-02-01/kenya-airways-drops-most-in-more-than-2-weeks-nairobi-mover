Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest carrier, dropped for a third day on
concern about increased competition and lower earnings.  The stock dropped 2.3 percent to 19.15 shillings, the
steepest decline in more than two weeks, by the close of trading
in Nairobi, the capital.  Kenya Airways said on Jan. 27 annual profit will drop at
least 25 percent after the European debt crisis, rising fuel
prices and political unrest in Egypt and  Nigeria  curbed revenue.
Airline entrepreneur Stelios Haji Ioannou’s easyGroup Holdings
Ltd. signed an  agreement  in December with Rubicon Diversified
Investments Plc to set up a low-cost African carrier.  “There has been a stream of negative news for the
airline,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said by phone today. “The news
by Rubicon is also weighing on investors’ minds that a huge
competitor is looking at the African market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
