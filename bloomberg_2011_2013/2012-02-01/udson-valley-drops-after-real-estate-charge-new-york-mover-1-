Hudson Valley Holding Corp. (HVB)  plunged
the most in more than two years as the commercial banking
company’s earnings missed analyst estimates after a charge to
meet a regulatory order to cut commercial real estate loans.  The fourth-quarter profit  excluding some items  was 27 cents
a share, missing the average analyst estimate of a profit of 41
cents a share in a Bloomberg survey. The stock sank 19 percent
to $17.79 at the close in New York, the biggest loss since April
2009.  The Yonkers, New York-based parent of Hudson Valley Bank
said it took charge-offs of $60.2 million reflecting a plan to
sell $474 million in loans by the middle of this year to comply
with an order from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
to reduce its concentration in commercial real estate and
classified loans.  “They’ve been forced to sell a portion of their assets,
which means they’re going to be earning less money,” Collyn Bement Gilbert, an analyst at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., said in a
phone interview. “It draws into question their risk management
practices, because the capital guidelines imposed by the OCC
have been pretty clear. For them to be caught off guard by this
and having the OCC to force them to sell this loan pool is kind
of puzzling.”  She cut her rating on the stock to “hold” from “buy,”
saying the shares would be “more fairly valued” in the $17 to
$18 range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
