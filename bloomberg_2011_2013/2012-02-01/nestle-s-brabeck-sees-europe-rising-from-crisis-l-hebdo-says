Nestle SA (NESN)  Chairman Peter Brabeck- Letmathe thinks the worst of the economic crisis may be behind
 Europe , L’Hebdo reported.  The risk of a Greek default now seems “remote,” L’Hebdo
reported in an e-mailed preview of an interview with Brabeck-
Letmathe to be published in tomorrow’s magazine. Europe can
emerge from the crisis stronger if the correct measures are
taken, Brabeck-Letmathe said, according to L’Hebdo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
