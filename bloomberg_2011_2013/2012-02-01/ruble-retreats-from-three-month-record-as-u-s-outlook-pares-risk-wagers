The ruble slipped from its strongest
level in three months after a report showed U.S. consumer
confidence fell, curbing demand for riskier assets.  The Russian currency depreciated 0.2 percent to 30.225 per
dollar at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, after gaining 6.5 percent
last month. It was 0.4 percent weaker at 39.8025 per euro and
lost 0.3 percent to 34.5349 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket.  The New York-based Conference Board’s confidence index
decreased to 61.1 yesterday, lower than the most pessimistic
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists, from a
revised 64.8 the prior month. The ruble’s strongest start to the
year since at least 2004 against the dollar may be threatened
after protests against the government this weekend remind
investors of political risks, according to Societe Generale SA’s
Russian unit.  Investors pared bets the Russian currency would weaken,
with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 30.5611 per
dollar in three months. Russia’s $3.5 billion of bonds due 2020
rose for the first day in four, pushing the yield down 12 basis
points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 4.243 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
