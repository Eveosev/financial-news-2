German  inflation  remained unchanged
in January after easing in the previous two months.  The inflation rate, calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, held at 2.3 percent, the Federal Statistics Office
said. Economists forecast an increase of 2.4 percent from a year
ago, according to the median of 23 estimates in a Bloomberg News
survey. Prices fell 0.5 percent from December.  The office had delayed publication of harmonized data,
citing new EU standards. Non-harmonized inflation eased to 2
percent from 2.1 percent in December, it said on Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
