Iran  has $120 billion in foreign
currency reserves and 907 tons of gold, the  Tehran Times 
reported, citing Yahya Ale-Eshagh, who heads the Tehran Chamber
of Commerce, Industries and Mines.  The  gold reserves  have a total value of $17.5 billion, the
newspaper cited Ale-Eshagh as saying. Iran has “no shortage”
of foreign currencies or gold to meet domestic demand, he said.  Ale-Eshagh said recent fluctuations in the gold and
currency markets were a result of mismanagement by some state
bodies; he called for tighter monetary control by the
government, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
