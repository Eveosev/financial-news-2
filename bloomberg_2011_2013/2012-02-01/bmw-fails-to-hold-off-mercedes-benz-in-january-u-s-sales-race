Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW
failed to keep its lead over  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz in
January, getting some payback after December’s sales push to
seal its place as 2011’s top-selling U.S. luxury brand.  BMW deliveries rose 3.1 percent to 16,405 last month in the
U.S., the Munich-based automaker said yesterday in a statement.
Mercedes sales rose 24 percent to 20,306, as deliveries of its
C-Class model surged 56 percent, the automaker said.  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Lexus brand deliveries declined 4.6 percent to
12,274 vehicles.  “BMW, perhaps, was a bit more aggressive in terms of
marketing and incentive efforts in December which may have
pulled ahead some of their sales from January,”  Jesse Toprak , a
Santa Monica, California-based analyst with TrueCar.com, said in
a telephone interview.  BMW deliveries, helped by the redesigned X3 sport-utility
vehicle, rose 13 percent last year to 247,907, allowing it to
claim the title as the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S.
after Lexus held the spot for 11 years. Lexus, hurt by
production shortages following the March earthquake in  Japan ,
saw deliveries fall 13 percent last year to 198,552, the Toyota
City, Japan-based brand has said.  Mercedes, helped by the updated C-Class sedan and new
coupe, finished 2011 in second place behind BMW with 2,715 fewer
sales. The Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker’s sales rose 13
percent in the U.S. last year to 245,192.  The results exclude Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart cars
and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  Sales of BMW’s 3 Series rose 16 percent to 6,698 cars in
January, as the automaker prepares to bring a redesigned version
to showrooms next month.  Audi, Cadillac  U.S. deliveries of Audi, the premium brand of Wolfsburg,
Germany-based  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , rose 20 percent to 9,354 vehicles
last month, the company said in a statement. It was the most
sales Audi has had in January, the automaker said.  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac luxury brand sales fell 29
percent last month to 8,924, according to the Detroit-based
automaker.  Porsche AG (PAH3) , the Stuttgart-based automaker, sold 2,550
vehicles in the U.S., a 6.3 percent increase, the company said
in a statement. Sales of the 911 model, to be replaced by a new
version next month, rose 56 percent to 681 cars.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s Infiniti sold 6,796 vehicles, 8.2
percent less than a year earlier, the Yokohama, Japan-based
company, said in a statement.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , based in  Tokyo , said in a statement that
sales for its Acura brand rose 5.3 percent to 8,381 last month.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 5,121 Lincolns in January, a 7.9
percent decrease from a year earlier, according to a statement
from the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Land Rover deliveries rose 41 percent to 3,205, while
Jaguar sales were up 5 percent to 985, the brands, owned by
Mumbai-based  Tata Motors Ltd (TTMT) , said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
