A 2010 lawsuit against  HSBC Holdings
Plc (HSBA)  by the trustee liquidating  Bernard Madoff ’s firm was
restored to the bankruptcy court docket as the trustee prepares
filings on an appeal of a district judge’s ruling that barred
him from claiming common-law damages.  The suit, filed in December 2010, was reentered on the
docket yesterday after the original suit was no longer available
on the docket.  The suit seeks $6.6 billion in damages from the bank, plus
$2 billion in transfers from other defendants.  The case is Picard v HSBC Bank Plc, 09-01364,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
