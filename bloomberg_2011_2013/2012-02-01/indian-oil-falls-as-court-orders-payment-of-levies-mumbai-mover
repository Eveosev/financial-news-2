Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) , the nation’s
biggest refiner, plunged the most in 14 months after saying a
court ruling ordering it to pay levies on crude supplies to
Uttar Pradesh state will have “financial implications.”  The state-owned refiner  dropped  6 percent to 271.45 rupees
in Mumbai, the steepest fall since Nov. 25, 2010. The  High Court 
of Allahabad dismissed Indian Oil’s petition against the Uttar
Pradesh Entry Tax Act of 2007 and upheld the validity of the
levy, Indian Oil said in a stock exchange filing today.  India ’s top court on Jan. 17 ordered the company to deposit
half of the tax payable to the government of Uttar Pradesh
state, where 12 percent of the company’s refining capacity is
located, and submit a bank guarantee for the remainder till it
reaches a verdict, according to the statement. The matter is
being examined legally, Indian Oil said.  The refinery at Mathura has an annual processing capacity
of 8 million metric tons a year, according to Indian Oil’s
website. The company’s total refining capacity is 65.7 million
tons a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
