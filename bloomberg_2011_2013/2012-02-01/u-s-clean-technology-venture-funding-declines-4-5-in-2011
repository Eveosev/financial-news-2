U.S. venture capital investment in
renewable power and energy-efficiency technology declined 4.5
percent to $4.9 billion last year from 2010, according to an
Ernst & Young LLP study.  A total of $940.5 million in 70 funding rounds was provided
in the fourth quarter to companies developing renewable sources
of electricity, storage and energy-efficiency technologies, New
York-based Ernst & Young said today in a statement.  The report, based on data from Dow Jones VentureSource,
comes after a year in which the renewable energy was battered by
waning government support in  Europe  and the U.S. and increasing
competition that drove down prices for  wind turbines  and solar
panels.  “Most would agree it’s a challenging economic
environment,” Jay Spencer, Ernst & Young LLP’s Americas
Cleantech Director, said in an interview.  Investments in storage companies grew the most last year,
more than tripling to $932.6 million from 2010.  Energy-efficiency companies received 78 founding rounds in
2011, more than all other segments, worth $646.9 million.  Investments in new U.S. power-generation technologies, the
largest segment, declined 5 percent last year to $1.5 billion.  Worldwide venture capital investments rose 4 percent to
$8.9 billion last year, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  Venture funding this year will be comparable to 2011,
Spencer said. He doesn’t anticipate “anything significant from
a decrease perspective.”  “We’re seeing things come to market and that’s going to
drive a desire for the products -- a pull in demand instead of a
push,” Spencer said. “This is a sign more money will flow into
the sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
