Unibail-Rodamco SE (UL) ,  Europe ’s largest
publicly traded property company, said full-year profit fell 2.6
percent after it sold properties and paid a special dividend.  Earnings excluding changes in the value of properties and
interest-rate derivatives, known as recurring profit, fell to
829.6 million euros ($1.1 billion), or 9.03 euros a share, from
847.9 million euros, or 9.27 euros, a year earlier the Paris-
based company said in a  statement .  The earnings per share exceeded the average 8.92-euros-a-
share  estimate of 22 analysts  and were better than the 3 percent
drop Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Poitrinal had predicted
as a result of disposals and a 1.8 billion-euro special
dividend.  “We’re shifting gears,” Chief Financial Officer Peter van Rossum said on a conference call. He forecast a 4 percent
increase in recurring earnings per share in 2012.  Since he led Unibail’s acquisition of Rodamco in 2007,
Poitrinal has sold 5.6 billion euros of properties to focus the
company’s investments on large dominant malls that attract
shoppers and higher-paying retail brands.  Unibail-Rodamco said this enabled it to sign 104 leases
with “premium” retail brands, including Superdry and Holister,
compared with 48 in 2010 and 14 in 2009.  Net rental income excluding acquisitions and disposals
increased by 4.4 percent, after the company attracted tenants
like Apple Inc. and Forever 21 Inc. Rents for renewed leases
rose by more than 19 percent.  Tenant Sales Rise  Sales generated by tenants at the company’s centers rose
2.8 percent last year, compared with a 0.8 percent decline in
retail sales nationally in the same countries, van Rossum said.
The company has a “positive outlook,” he added, even though
many European economies face recession this year.  Net asset value rose 2.9 percent in the six months to Dec.
31 to 130.70 euros, the company said today.  Gains in property values contributed 498.2 million euros to
Unibail-Rodamco’s 1.33-billion-euro  net income . In 2010, a
larger appreciation of its properties prompted the company to
report a restated net income of 2.19 billion euros.  Net rental income was little changed at 1.26 billion euros
after Unibail-Rodamco  sold 1.3 billion euros  of real estate last
year. The company plans to pay a  dividend  of 8 euros a share.  Unibail-Rodamco reported its full-year earnings after the
market close. The  shares  rose 2.7 percent to 150.80 euros in
Paris. The stock has declined 1.9 percent during the past six
months, compared with a 9.9 percent drop for the FTSE   EPRA-
Nareit Real Estate Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
