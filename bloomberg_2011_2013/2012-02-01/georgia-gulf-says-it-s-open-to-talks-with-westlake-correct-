(Corrects first paragraph to say Westlake isn’t seeking
restrictive standstill provisions.)  Georgia Gulf Corp. (GGC)  said it’s open to
negotiations with  Westlake Chemical Corp. (WLK)  and isn’t seeking
standstill provisions that would prevent Westlake from taking
control of the company or making nominations to the board in a
“timely” fashion.  Georgia Gulf Chief Executive Officer Paul D. Carrico
commented in a filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
