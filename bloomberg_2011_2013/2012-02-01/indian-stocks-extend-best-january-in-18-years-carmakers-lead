Indian equities extended the best
January in 18 years as European stocks rallied and local car
sales climbed.  Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL) , the country’s biggest carmaker,
paced gains among peers after its sales rose for the first time
in eight months.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , the aluminum maker
that controls U.S.-based Novelis Inc., surged 4.6 percent.  Tata
Power Co. (TPWR) , the biggest generator outside state control, jumped
to its highest level in five months.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, increased 0.7
percent to 17,314.38, according to preliminary closing prices at
3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, reversing a drop of as much as 0.8 percent.
The measure surged 11 percent in January, the best opening month
to a year since 1994, as the rupee rose, the central bank eased
monetary policy, inflation slowed and  earnings  of some companies
beat forecasts, prompting  foreigners  to buy $2.1 billion of
stocks. India’s manufacturing grew at the fastest pace in eight
months in January.  The S&P CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index on the National Stock Exchange of
India increased 0.7 percent to 5,235.70. The  BSE 200 Index  added
0.9 percent to 2,116.90.  The  Stoxx 600  surged 1.4 percent in  London  today. The gauge
rallied 4 percent last month, the biggest January gain since
1998 as the  U.S. economy  maintained its recovery and speculation
grew that European policy makers will contain the region’s debt
crisis.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to 57.5 from 54.2 in
December, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said today. A
number above 50 indicates expansion. India joins  China  in
reporting an improvement in manufacturing numbers, suggesting
the world’s fastest-growing major economies are withstanding the
impact of Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
