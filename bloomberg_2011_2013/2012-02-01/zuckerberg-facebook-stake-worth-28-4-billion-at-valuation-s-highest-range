Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s initial public
offering, heralded in a regulatory filing today, is poised to
widen the ranks of the world’s billionaires.  Chief Executive Officer  Mark Zuckerberg , 27, is the biggest
stakeholder in the company as it prepares to go public, with
28.4 percent ownership, while investment firms Accel Partners
and Digital Sky Technologies own a combined 16.8 percent.  Zuckerberg, who started Facebook in his Harvard University
dorm room in 2004, owns 533.8 million shares of the largest
social network, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, whose work
on the company was depicted in the Oscar-winning 2010 film  “The
Social Network,”  owns 133.8 million shares, or 7.6 percent.  Facebook said in its prospectus that it plans to raise as
much as $5 billion in an initial public offering. The company is
discussing a valuation of $75 billion to $100 billion, two
people familiar with the matter said last week. Assuming the
 Menlo Park , California-based company is valued at the top end of
the range, Zuckerberg will own stock worth $28.4 billion.  By comparison, Google Inc. co-founders Sergey Brin and
Larry Page are each worth more than $15 billion based on their
ownership of that company’s shares. Larry Ellison owns stock
worth about $31 billion in Oracle Corp., the software company he
founded in 1977.  Facebook Chief Operating Officer  Sheryl Sandberg  owns 1.9
million shares, or 0.1 percent.  Peter Thiel , who provided a seed
investment for Zuckerberg in 2004, owns 44.7 million shares, or
2.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
