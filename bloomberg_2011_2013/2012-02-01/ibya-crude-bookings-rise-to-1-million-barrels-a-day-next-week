Nine tankers have been booked so far
to load about 1 million barrels a day of crude oil in  Libya  next
week, according to data from Poten & Partners Inc.  The ships have been chartered to pick up 970,000 metric
tons, the equivalent of about 7.1 million barrels, the New York-
based shipbroker’s figures show. That’s up from 375,000 tons in
the week ended Feb. 4. Libya’s state-run National Oil Corp.
planned to export 12.7 million barrels of crude in the week to
today, according to Ahmed El-Mihoub, a marketing official in
Tripoli.  The absence of Libyan production helped crude traded in
London reach a 2011 high of $127.02 a barrel in April. The
benchmark Brent grade has since dropped 12 percent to $112.31.
The resumption of the nation’s supply has been followed by
 Iran ’s threat to block the  Strait of Hormuz , the Persian Gulf
passageway for about 20 percent of globally traded oil, renewing
supply concerns.  The following table shows weekly charters for crude cargoes
from Libya, according to Poten. Cargo size is expressed in
metric tons. Some cargoes are shipped under long-term freight
contracts and don’t appear in lists of vessel bookings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
