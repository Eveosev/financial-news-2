Land buying in  Africa  risks causing
civil unrest as governments and investors ignore customary
rights of local users, according to the Rights and Resources
Initiative, a non-profit coalition of advocacy groups.  Conflict about land ownership has “fractured” Liberia and
 South Sudan , the Washington-based group wrote in an online
 statement  today. Two-thirds of land being bought by investors is
in Africa, the group wrote, citing research by political
economist Liz Alden Wily.  A review of tenure rights in 35 African countries by Alden
Wily found governments claim most of 1.4 billion hectares (3.46
billion acres) of rural land, including forests, that is held in
common by local communities, affecting at least 428 million
rural poor in sub-Saharan Africa, the group wrote.  “Controversial land acquisitions were a key factor
triggering the civil wars in Sudan, Liberia and Sierra Leone,
and there is every reason to be concerned that conditions are
ripe for new conflicts to occur in many other places,” Jeffrey
Hatcher, global program director at the Rights and Resources
Initiative, was quoted as saying in the statement.  Nine of the 35 countries in Africa which Alden Wily
researched were rated as “broadly positive” for their
treatment of local customary rights, led by  Uganda , Tanzania,
 Burkina Faso  and South Sudan, according to the group.  Brazil  is an example of a country that has avoided conflict
and achieved both forest conservation and development by
recognizing local people’s right to forests, the Rights and
Resources Initiative wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
