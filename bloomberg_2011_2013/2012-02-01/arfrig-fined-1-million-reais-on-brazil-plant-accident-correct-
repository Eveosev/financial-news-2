(Corrects currency conversion in first paragraph.)  Marfrig Alimentos SA (MRFG3) , Latin America’s
second-largest beef producer, was fined 1 million reais
($572,000) for a toxic gas leak in a leather-tanning  plant in
central-western Brazil that killed four workers.  Marfrig was fined for the emission of gases that are
harmful to human health in the accident yesterday, Ednilson
Paulino Queiroz, a Mato Grosso do Sul state  environmental agent ,
said today by telephone from state capital Campo Grande. The
state’s police is investigating the deaths.  The leak at the Bataguassu plant left another 20 people
overcome by fumes, three of whom are still in hospital, Sao
Paulo-based Marfrig said in an e-mailed statement today. The
plant has been shut while the cause of the accident is
investigated, Marfrig said.  Marfrig declined to comment on the fine in an e-mailed
response to questions.  The meatpacker led by Chief Executive Officer Marcos Antonio Molina is a leather supplier to automakers  Volkswagen AG (VOW3) 
and  General Motors Co. (GM)  and has the capacity to produce about
14,000 pieces of leather a day, according to its website.  Marfrig fell 1.7 percent to 8.02 reais in  Sao Paulo  trading
yesterday. The stock has dropped 4.5 percent this year, while
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index gained 11 percent.  JBS SA (JBSS3)  is the world’s largest beef producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
