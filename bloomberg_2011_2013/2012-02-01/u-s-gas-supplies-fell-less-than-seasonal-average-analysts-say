Natural gas supplies probably
declined less than the seasonal average last week as mild
weather across most of the U.S. crimped demand for the heating
fuel, analyst estimates show.  Inventories dropped 129 billion cubic feet, or 4.2 percent,
to 2.969 trillion cubic feet in the week ended Jan. 27, based on
the median of 17  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The
five-year average change for the week is a decrease of 186
billion, according to the Energy Department, whose weekly
stockpile report is due at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow.  Heating demand was 27 percent below normal on average in
the U.S. for the week ended Jan. 28, according to Weather
Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri . The low in Boston on Jan. 27
was 37 degrees Fahrenheit (3 Celsius), 15 degrees above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. of  State College , Pennsylvania.  “Everything right now is being driven by supply and
weather,” said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke Associates LLC
in Louisville,  Kentucky . “There’s no real buying coming in.
This market seems to be searching for a floor.”  Gas has tumbled 9.4 percent this week on forecasts for mild
weather. Prices also dropped after Exxon Mobil Corp. said it
hasn’t cut drilling even after gas tumbled to the lowest price
in 10 years. Prices gained 14 percent last week after  Chesapeake
Energy (CHK)  Corp. and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  announced production cuts.  All of the analysts predicted that the weekly supply report
from the Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration
would show a stockpile decrease, with estimates ranging from 115
billion to 136 billion cubic feet.  Natural gas rose 33.5 cents, or 14 percent, to $2.678 per
million British thermal units last week on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Gas for March delivery slid 9.1 cents, or
3.6 percent, to $2.412 at 11:19 a.m. today. Prices fell to
$2.231 Jan. 23, the lowest intraday price since February 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
