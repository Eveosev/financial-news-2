AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB) , the
second-largest publicly traded U.S. apartment owner, said funds
from operations climbed in the fourth quarter as rising demand
allowed the nation’s landlords to increase rents.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, rose to $113.4 million, or $1.19 a share, from $86.8
million, or $1.01, a year earlier, the Alexandria, Virginia-
based real estate investment trust said in a statement today.
Analysts  expected  FFO of $1.22 a share, the average of 21
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Demand for rental apartments has soared in the face of an
improving  job market  that’s prompted college graduates to seek
their own housing, according to Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst
with Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP in New York. Apartment rents
in the U.S. climbed 4.1 percent in the 12 months through
December, according to  Axiometrics Inc.  The Dallas-based
research firm projects a 6.7 percent increase in landlords’
rental revenue for the year from 2011.  “The economy is growing slowly, college-age unemployment
is about half the national average, there is very little new
supply, so apartment landlords have been in a very good spot,”
Goldfarb, who has a “hold” rating on AvalonBay, said in an
interview before earnings were announced.  Fourth-quarter results were released after the close of
regular U.S. trading. AvalonBay shares rose 0.7 percent today to
$136.92 in New York. The shares have gained 18.5 percent in the
past 12 months, compared with a 14 percent advance in the
Bloomberg REIT Apartment Index of 16 companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
