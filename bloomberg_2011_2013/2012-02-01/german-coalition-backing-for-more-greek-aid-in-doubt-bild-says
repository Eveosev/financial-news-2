German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  may
struggle to convince lawmakers from her coalition of Christian
Unionists and Free Democrats to back a second aid package for
 Greece ,  Bild-Zeitung  said, citing party officials it didn’t
identify.  More than 40 lawmakers from Merkel’s coalition are
considering rejecting the new bailout, which may result in
Merkel having to rely on the backing of opposition parties to
pass the motion in parliament, the newspaper said.  Merkel’s coalition has 330 seats in the lower house while
the opposition has 290, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
