Ukraine’s grain exports fell 27
percent in January compared with the previous month because of
cold weather and insufficient railway carriers, the country’s
Agrarian Confederation said.  Shipments declined to 1.9 million tons, Sergey Stoianov,
director of the producers’ group, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Corn accounted for 1.3 million tons and shipments fell
by 35 percent from December, according to the statement. Wheat
shipments were almost unchanged from the previous month at
540,000 tons, Stoianov said. Exports also included
70,000 tons of barley, according to the statement.  Outbound shipments of grain were 11.6 million tons since
the marketing year started on July 1, Stoianov said. That
includes 6.2 million tons of corn, 3.3 million tons of wheat and
2 million tons of barley, according to the confederation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
