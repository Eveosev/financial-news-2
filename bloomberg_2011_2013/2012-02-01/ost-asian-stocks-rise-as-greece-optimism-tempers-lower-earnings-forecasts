Most Asian  stocks  advanced as
expanding manufacturing activity in  India  and China tempered
concerns that economies across the region and the U.S. may be
slowing down.  Tata Power Co., India’s biggest electricity generator
outside of state control, jumped 6 percent in Mumbai. Shipping
stocks rallied on speculation rising cargo rates will shore up
earnings. Australian banks fell after a gauge of  home prices 
retreated by a record in 2011. Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd.
sank 9.6 percent in  Tokyo  after the machinery maker cut its
full-year profit forecast by 28 percent.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)   added 0.1 percent to 122.98 at
122.98 as of 7:14 p.m. in Tokyo, with about five shares rising
for every four that fell. In January, the measure posted its
biggest monthly advance since September 2010 amid bets  China 
will ease lending curbs, the  U.S. economy  is improving and
 Europe  is containing its debts crisis.  “Economic data from China and India are quite positive,”
said Yoji Takeda, who manages about $1.1 billion at RBC
Investment Management (Asia) Ltd. “The most significant issue
for the market is Europe. Assuming the situation settles down,
probably the rally in Asian stocks can be sustained.”  ‘Faring Better’  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average  added 0.1 percent, while
South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 0.2 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index slipped 0.9 percent. India’s BSE Sensitive
Index lost 0.6 percent as the nation’s manufacturing growth
accelerated, reducing the scope for the central bank to cut
 interest rates .  India electricity and steel producers advanced. Tata Power
climbed 6 percent to 110.15 rupees in Mumbai.  Jindal Steel &
Power Ltd. , the nation’s biggest producer of the metal by market
value, jumped 6.3 percent to 576.1 rupees.  Shipping stocks rallied as data from the Shanghai Shipping
Exchange showed spot prices for hauling containers to Europe and
the U.S. climbed in January from a month ago, bolstering hopes
earnings will improve in the first quarter.  “Cargo rates seem to be faring better than what was
earlier expected,” said Jee Heon Seok, an analyst at NH
Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “This appears to be
raising expectations that first-quarter earnings will probably
be better than the previous quarter.”  Hanjin Shipping Co. (117930) , South Korea’s No. 1 shipping line,
climbed 9.3 percent to 14,750 won in Seoul.  China Shipping
Container Lines Ltd. (2866) , the nation’s second-largest cargo-box
carrier, jumped 15 percent to HK$1.98 in  Hong Kong . China Cosco
Holdings Co., the country’s sector leader, advanced 6.1 percent
to HK$4.68.  China Policy  China’s  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  sank 1.1 percent, erasing
gains of as much as 0.6 percent, on speculation the stronger-
than-expected Chinese manufacturing report today reduces the
need for further monetary-policy easing. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng
Index slipped 0.3 percent.  “Some investors may be disappointed because they were
hoping for faster easing of monetary policy.” said Ng Soo Nam,
Singapore-based chief investment officer at Nikko Asset
Management Asia Ltd., which oversees about $165 billion. “Signs
that the Chinese economy is heading towards a soft landing are a
very good scenario.”  Chinese lenders and developers declined. Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world’s biggest lender by
market value, slipped 1.3 percent to HK$5.36 in Hong Kong.
 Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , the nation’s third-biggest bank
by market value, lost 0.8 percent to HK$3.80. Sino-Ocean Land
Holdings Ltd., a China-based developer, sank 4.3 percent to
HK$3.82.  Australian banks declined as the nation’s house prices
plunged by the most on record in 2011 as global economic
uncertainty and concerns about its impact at home kept a lid on
demand.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , Australia’s second-largest lender,
slipped 1.4 percent to A$20.85. National Australia Bank Ltd.,
the third-biggest, lost 0.8 percent to A$23.66.  Exporters Drop  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.6
percent after falling as much as 0.3 percent today. The gauge
retreated 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday after a report
showed that American consumer confidence unexpectedly dropped in
January.  Exporters to the U.S. declined as falling home prices and
cooling business activity added to signs the recovery in the
world’s biggest economy may stall after expanding in the fourth
quarter at the fastest pace since 2010.  Li & Fung Ltd. , which counts the U.S. as its biggest
market, slipped 1.8 percent to HK$16.66. Sony Corp., Japan’s
largest exporter of consumer electronics, slid 1.9 percent to

 to  10,230 yen in Osaka.  Sumitomo Heavy (6302)  slumped 9.8 percent to 440 yen, the biggest
decline on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The company cut its net-
income forecast by 28 percent to 20 billion yen ($262 million)
for the year ending March 31, citing the stronger yen and an
economic slowdown in China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
