Polish manufacturing grew for the
first time in three months in January as a weaker zloty buoyed
exports to  Europe  even as the euro region struggles to contain a
debt crisis.  The purchasing managers’ index, a gauge of manufacturing,
rose to 52.2 from 48.8 in December, HSBC Holdings said in an e-
mailed statement summarizing the results of a survey by Markit
Economics. A median estimate of 17 economists in a Bloomberg
survey forecast an advance to 49.4. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion.  Poland was the only country in the 27-member European Union
to avoid a recession in 2009 and the  economy  expanded 4.3
percent last year, the  Central Statistics Office  reported last
week in a preliminary estimate. While gross domestic product in
the euro area may fall 0.3 percent this year, according to the
 World Bank , Poland’s economy may grow 2.5 percent, Prime
Minister Donald Tusk said Dec. 20.  To contact the reporters on this story:
