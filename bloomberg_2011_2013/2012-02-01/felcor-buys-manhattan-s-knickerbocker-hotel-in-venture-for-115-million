FelCor Lodging Trust Inc. (FCH)  bought the
Knickerbocker Hotel in  Manhattan  in a joint venture for $115
million as the real estate investment trust expands in  New York .  The property at Broadway and 42nd Street was purchased in
partnership with an affiliate of Highgate Holdings LLC, Irving,
Texas-based FelCor said today in a statement. The Knickerbocker
is FelCor’s third property in New York, and its redevelopment
will be completed late next year, according to the statement.
FelCor also said it is marketing 16 hotels and plans to use
money from the sales to reduce debt.  The REIT is focusing on large, urban markets such as New
York and expects to get about $350 million in gross proceeds
from the sale of the hotels, which include properties in
Orlando, Toronto and  San Antonio . FelCor “has received strong
interest from potential buyers” and anticipates selling most of
the hotels this year, according to the statement.  FelCor intends to eventually sell as many as 40 hotels, or
72 percent of its suburban properties and 44 percent of its
airport hotels, as part of its realignment strategy.  The company rose 2 cents to $3.81 yesterday in New York
trading. The shares have lost about 46 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
