South African poultry producers want
the import duty on Brazilian chicken to be increased by 3 rand
($0.38) a kilogram (2.2 pounds),  Business Day  reported, citing
David Wolpert, chief executive officer of the Association of
Meat Importers and Exporters.  Importers are currently paying customs duty of 27 percent
on whole chicken and 2.20 rand a kilogram on boneless cuts, the
Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The requested duty increase
would raise the price of whole birds imported from  Brazil  by 29
percent and boneless cuts by 15 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
