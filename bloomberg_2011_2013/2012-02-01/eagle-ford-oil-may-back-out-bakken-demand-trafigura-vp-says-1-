Eagle Ford crude production in the
U.S. Gulf Coast may back out some demand for oil from the Bakken
formation in  North Dakota , said Tyler Radcliffe, vice president
of supply and facilities at Trafigura AG.  “It will have a significant impact on the Bakken in the
Gulf going forward,” Radcliffe said during a presentation at
the Bakken Product Markets & Takeaway Capacity 2012 conference
in Denver. “The Gulf is the logical destination for that Eagle
Ford.”  Oil production from North Dakota surged to 510,000 barrels
a day in November. Production from the Eagle Ford in  Texas  was
150,000 barrels a day in 2011 and is projected to climb to
470,000 in 2015, Harold “Skip” York, a Houston-based vice
president at Wood Mackenzie Ltd., a research and consulting
firm, said Jan. 26.  “This influx of light supply will decrease our need to
bring in Bakken with a higher transportation cost,” Radcliffe
said. “You will start to see some of that demand backed out,
other than the take-or-pay commitments that may be in place on
rail.”  Trafigura is a commodity trading company based in
 Switzerland .  To contact the reporter on this story:
