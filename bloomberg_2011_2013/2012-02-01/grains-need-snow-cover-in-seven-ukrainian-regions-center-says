Winter grains in seven of Ukraine’s
25 regions lack snow cover deep enough to help plants survive
freezing temperatures, the national weather center said.  Temperatures dropped to minus 29 degrees Celsius (minus 20
degrees Fahrenheit) last night, Tetiana Adamenko, head of the
center’s agro-meteorology department, said by phone from Kiev
today. About half the plants in areas lacking snow may be ruined
unless the weather starts warming tomorrow and the following
day, she said.  “This temperature decline is very dangerous, especially
for winter barley planted in the south,” Adamenko said. About
half the barley sown will probably be lost, and winter wheat may
also suffer if soil temperatures fall further, according to the
meteorologist.  Snow is insufficient in the central Vinnytsya region, in
parts of Odessa, Mykolayiv, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya in the
south, and in Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk in the country’s east,
Adamenko said. Winter grains cover about 4.2 million hectares
(10.4 million acres) in those areas, according to Agriculture
Ministry figures.  The southern Autonomous Republic of Crimea also lacks snow,
Adamenko said.  Temperatures are likely to begin rising as of Feb. 4,
though they’ll remain below zero, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
