Crude oil options volatility rose as
underlying futures fell a fourth day to a six-week low.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.9 as of 3:30 p.m. in New York, up from
28.5 yesterday.  Crude for March delivery fell 87 cents to settle at $97.61
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement price since Dec. 20. Prices have fallen 2.1 percent
in four days.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
March $95 puts, with 1,697 lots changing hands at 3:35 p.m. They
rose 28 cents to $1.28 a barrel. March $90 puts, the second-most
active options, gained 8 cents to 37 cents with 1,589 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Calls accounted for 60 percent of electronic trading volume
and were four of the seven most-active contracts.  “The March $110 and the April $115 calls were trading and
there was interest in the April $135 calls,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .
“Most call activity you’re seeing is liquidation. It seems to
be a fund and I think they’re getting out of some of them.”  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  Bearish options accounted for 51 percent of volume in the
previous session. March $95 puts were the most actively traded,
with 6,875 lots changing hands as they rose 4 cents to $1 a
barrel. The next-most active options, March $100 calls, dropped
15 cents to $1.53 on volume of 3,920 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 39,945
contracts. Next were December $150 calls with 36,827 lots and
December $100 calls with 33,424.  To contact the reporter on this story:
