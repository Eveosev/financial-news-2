Portugal ’s borrowing costs declined
at a sale of 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) of bills even as
demand for the securities dropped.  The country sold 750 million euros of bills due in July
2012 at an average yield of 4.463 percent, the debt management
agency said today. That compares with an average yield of 4.74
percent at a previous auction of similar securities on Jan. 18.
The auction attracted bids for 2.65 times the amount sold,
compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.97 in January.  Portuguese yields have fallen for two consecutive days, the
10-year yield climbed to a euro-era record on Jan. 30, as
concern eased that investors in the nation’s securities may be
forced to take losses in the event of a Greek debt-swap deal.  “Portugal managed to sell about 1.5 billion euros worth of
bills without much incident,” UBS AG analyst  Geoffrey Yu  wrote
today in an e-mailed report. “Its spreads over benchmark have
also declined.”  Portuguese two-year notes jumped, with yields 108 basis
points lower at 19.47 percent at 12:57 p.m. London time.  Ten-
year bonds  also climbed, pushing the yield down 97 basis points,
or 0.97 percentage point, to 15.43 percent. The extra yield
investors demand to hold the 10-year securities instead of
benchmark German bunds fell 1 percentage point to 13.61 percent.  The debt agency also sold 750 million euros of three-month
bills due in May at an average yield of 4.068 percent,
attracting bids for 2.8 times the amount offered. That compares
with an average yield of 4.346 percent at a previous auction of
three-month bills on Jan. 18, and a bid-to-cover ratio of 4.1.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, said on Jan. 26 that
the range for today’s auctions was between 1.25 billion euros
and 1.5 billion euros. Including today’s auctions, Portugal has
sold 5 billion euros of bills this year. The IGCP said on Dec.
29 that the total indicative amount of bill auctions planned for
the first quarter of 2012 was as much as 6.5 billion euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
