Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,  Brazil ’s
state-controlled oil producer, sold $7 billion of bonds overseas
in the country’s largest corporate debt offering ever.  The issue matched SABMiller Plc’s $7 billion offer last
month as the largest sale since March. Petrobras, the biggest
emerging-market issuer of overseas debt in 2011, sold $1.25
billion of three-year notes and $1.75 billion of five-year bonds
as well as more of its notes maturing in 2021 and 2041,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The three-year debt
priced to yield 275 basis points above similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries while the five-year notes pay 290 basis points more.  Petrobras is  raising cash  to help finance $224.7 billion of
investments in the five years through 2015 as it seeks to more
than double oil output by 2020. The Rio de Janeiro-based company
sold $6 billion of notes in January 2011 in what the country’s
largest-ever offering. Petrobras also issued bonds in euros and
pounds last year, raising about $9.6 billion in international
markets, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s a lot of money out there and it’s a credit that
people like, people are familiar with, and it’s a blue-chip
name,” Su Fei Koo, who helps manage about $850 million in
emerging-market debt at Doubleline Capital LP, said in a
telephone interview from  Los Angeles .  Yields Fall  Petrobras sold $2.75 billion more of its bonds due in 2021
and $1.25 billion more of its securities maturing in 2041 to
yield 295 basis points more than Treasuries, Bloomberg data
show.  The  average yield  on investment-grade company debt in
 emerging markets  has fallen 29 basis points, or 0.29 percentage
point, over the past two months to 4.94 percent, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s CEMBI Index. Yields on Petrobras’s
securities due January 2021 fell one basis point at 3:41 p.m. in
New York to 4.65 percent, Bloomberg data show.  Chief Financial Officer Almir Barbassa said in a Jan. 12
interview that Petrobras is seeking to sell a similar amount
this year as the $9.6 billion it issued in 2011. The company is
rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, four steps above junk,
and BBB by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, the second
lowest level of investment grade. It last sold international
bonds in December, when it offered 700 million pounds of bonds
maturing in 2026.  BB Securities, Citigroup Inc., Itau BBA, JPMorgan Chase &
Co., Morgan Stanley and  Banco Santander  managed the sale for
Petrobras, according to a person familiar with the transaction
who asked not to be identified because he isn’t authorized to
speak publicly on the matter.  Petrobras shares gained 1.5 percent to 24.95 reais. The
stock is up 16 percent this year, compared with a gain of 14
percent for Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  Petrobras announced Jan. 23 plans to name Maria das Gracas Foster to replace Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli.
The company missed its 2011 production target because of
equipment delays and more regulatory scrutiny after an  oil spill 
in the  Gulf of Mexico  in 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
