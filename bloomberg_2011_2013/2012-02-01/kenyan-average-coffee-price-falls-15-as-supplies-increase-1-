Kenyan coffee prices fell 15 percent
at an auction yesterday as supplies increased and as demand was
subdued, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said.  The average price for all coffee sold dropped to $280.87 a
50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $331.87 two weeks earlier, the
Nairobi-based agency said today by e-mail. It didn’t hold an
auction last week because of insufficient supplies.  The average price for the benchmark AA grade was little
changed at $405.73 a bag, from $405.91 at the previous sale,
after supplies rose, the exchange said. Supplies of the grade
increased 7.2 percent to 5,267 bags, while sales fell to 584
bags from 2,396 bags, the exchange said.  “Prices were down because of low demand,” Kizito Keya, a
coffee dealer at Mumba Coffee Ltd. said by phone from Nairobi.
“It appears many buyers had already covered their positions and
are waiting for new orders.”  Sales at the auction fell almost 17 percent to 6,564 bags
valued at $2.24 million from 7,883 bags worth $3.2 million at
the previous auction, the agency said.  Supplies of the beans at the third auction of 2012 climbed
12 percent to 26,902 bags from 23,962 bags, the agency said.  Kenya harvests the bulk of its crop from October through
December, while a secondary crop is reaped from April to June.  The nation, whose output slumped 13 percent to 36,629
metric tons in the 12 months ended Sept. 30, from 42,096 tons a
year earlier, is yet to make a forecast for 2011-12, Isaac
Muchomba, an official at the Kenya Coffee Traders Association,
said Jan. 17.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in U.S.
