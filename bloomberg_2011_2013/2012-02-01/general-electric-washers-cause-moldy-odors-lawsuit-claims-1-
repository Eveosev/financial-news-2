General Electric Co. (GE)  was sued by a
consumer who claims its front-loading washing machines have
design defects that give a moldy and mildewy odor to clothes.  The complaint, in federal court in  Newark ,  New Jersey ,
claims the washers accumulate mold and mildew caused by a
failure of the machines to clean and rid themselves of
byproducts of washing. It claims GE hid from consumers the need
to run extra cycles of hot water or bleach to combat mold.  “Items washed in the washing machines smell foul due to
the mold problems,” claims the lawsuit by Stanley Fishman of
West Orange, New Jersey, seeking group, or class-action, status.
“GE also fails to disclose the extraordinary maintenance and
associated expenses that its washing machines require to combat
the accumulation of mold, mildew and biofilm.”  Kim Freeman, a spokeswoman for General Electric, based in
Fairfield,  Connecticut , said the company hadn’t seen the lawsuit
and couldn’t immediately comment on it. GE is the largest U.S.
supplier of appliances for new homes.  The complaint, filed yesterday, claims GE violated the New
Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, breached express and implied
warranties, and unjustly enriched itself. It seeks unspecified
compensatory damages.  The case is Fishman v. General Electric Co., 12-cv-585,
U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
