MiaSole Inc., a closely held
manufacturer of thin-film solar products, is producing panels in
volume that convert 14 percent of the energy in sunlight into
electricity.  MiaSole’s conversion efficiency rates have increased by
more than 30 percent in the past year, the  Santa Clara ,
California-based company said today in a  statement .  That’s higher than the 12.4 percent average efficiency that
 First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s biggest thin-film solar company,
reported for the third quarter. MiaSole sells panels with a
layer of a copper-indium-gallium-selenide compound sandwiched
between sheets of glass.  Increasing electricity output from each panel reduces the
price of the power, which helps solar compete against energy
derived from lower-cost fossil fuels. MiaSole has reached 17.3
percent efficiency in a lab.  Thin-film panels make up about 15 percent of the global
market for solar power, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance. They are less efficient than the more-common panels
made with polysilicon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
