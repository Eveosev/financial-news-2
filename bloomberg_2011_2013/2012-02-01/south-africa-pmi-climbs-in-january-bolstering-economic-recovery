South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
 index  rebounded to a seven-month high in January, a sign that
the recovery in manufacturing may be strengthening, Kagiso Tiso
Holdings said.  The seasonally adjusted index rose to 53.2 from 49.4 in
December, Johannesburg-based  Kagiso  said in an e-mailed
statement today. The median estimate of 4 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for the index to rise to 50.2. A number above 50
indicates an expansion in factory output.  “The expected business conditions index remains very
optimistic,” Abdul Davids, Kagiso Asset Management’s head of
research in  Cape Town , said in the statement.  The recovery in  manufacturing , which accounts for about 15
percent of the economy, may help to bolster gross domestic
product, which expanded near a two-year low of 1.4 percent in
the third quarter. The  Reserve Bank  kept its benchmark  interest
rate  unchanged at a 30-year low of 5.5 percent in 2011 to
support  consumer spending  and growth in Africa’s biggest
economy.  The index measuring new sales orders increased 9 points to
57.3 last month and the business activity sub-index rose 3.9
points to 53.6, Kagiso said.  The price sub-index remained above 80 as “purchasing
managers continued to indicate that input cost pressures are on
the rise,” Davids said.  The Bureau for  Economic Research , based at the University
of Stellenbosch near Cape Town, and the Institute of Purchasing
and Supply South Africa conduct the PMI survey on behalf of
Kagiso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
