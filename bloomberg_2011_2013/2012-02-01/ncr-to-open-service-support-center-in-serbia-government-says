(Corrects Jan. 30 story to reflect the future team will
not have a research and development unit.)  NCR Corp. (NCR) , the world’s biggest
supplier of automated teller machines, will open a service
support center in Serbia next month, the government said.  The investment, worth 5 million euros ($6.56 million) to 6
million euros in the first phase, will include a call center for
client support covering southeastern  Europe , northern Africa and
the  Middle East , Serbia’s Economy Minister Nebojsa Ciric said.  “NCR is opening a new remote services support center in
Belgrade to provide remote service support for customers. The
roles will be highly technical and support our customer
engineers across Europe through specialized software.” the
company said in e-mailed comment. Serbia was chosen “after
carefully considering a number of factors, including a
multilingual workforce, reliable infrastructure and government
support.”  The facility will create 300 highly technical service jobs
that will help NCR provide “high quality, high value services
to our customers across multiple industries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
