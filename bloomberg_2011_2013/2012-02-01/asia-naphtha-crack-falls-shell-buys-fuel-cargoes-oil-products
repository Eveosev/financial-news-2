Asia ’s naphtha crack spread fell,
signaling reduced profit for refiners making the petrochemical
feedstock. Trafigura Beheer BV bought gasoline and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc purchased  fuel-oil  cargoes in Singapore.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent-crude futures
dropped to $129.52 a metric ton at 3 p.m. Singapore time from
$136.88 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of refining profit, widened 42 percent
in January to gain for a second month.  Glencore International Plc sold 25,000 tons of open-
specification  naphtha  for first-half April delivery to Cargill
Inc. at $979 a ton, based on a Bloomberg News survey of traders
who monitored transactions on the Platts window.  Glencore and Vitol Group agreed to swap naphtha for first-
half March delivery with a second-half April cargo at $7 a ton,
the survey showed. Glencore also agreed with Koch Industries Inc.
to exchange a second-half March cargo for first-half April at $6
a ton.  Trafigura bought four 50,000-barrel cargoes of  92-RON 
gasoline, based on the survey. Gracewood International Ltd. sold
two cargoes at $123.10 a barrel and $123.50. Gunvor Group Ltd.
and Total SA each sold one cargo at $123.20 a barrel. Gunvor
purchased 50,000 barrels of  95-RON  grade from Total at 125.40 a
barrel.  Fuel Oil  Shell bought 20,000 tons of  180-centistoke  fuel oil from
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, paying $13.75 a ton over
benchmark quotes, according to the Bloomberg survey. Shell,
 Europe ’s largest oil company, also purchased a similar-sized
cargo of  380-centistoke  grade from PetroChina Co. at the same
premium. Both cargoes are for Feb. 16 to Feb. 20, the earliest
loading period.  Fuel oil fell $1.65 to $2.04 a barrel below Asian marker
Dubai crude at 2:43 p.m.  Singapore  time, based on data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. Yesterday, this  crack spread 
turned negative for the first time in five days, signaling
losses for refiners processing oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade increased 25 cents to $10.50 a ton, PVM said. This
 viscosity spread  narrowed 23 percent in the past three days,
meaning bunker, or marine fuel, declined less than higher-
quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  The premium of  gasoil , or diesel, to Dubai crude rose 12
cents to $18.75 a barrel at 2:43 p.m. Singapore time, according
to PVM. This  crack spread  widened for the fifth day in six.  Jet fuel  climbed 85 cents to 20 cents a barrel below gasoil,
PVM data showed. This  regrade  has been at a discount since Jan.
16, indicating it is unprofitable to produce  aviation fuel  over
diesel.  Refinery News  Japan ’s TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. plans to shut two crude-
distillation units at its Kawasaki refinery in May for
maintenance, two people familiar with the matter said. The
company isn’t planning to close a 540,000 ton-a-year naphtha
cracker at the refinery for repairs this year.  Tenders  Itochu Corp. and Cargill Inc. bought as much as 50,000 tons
of naphtha from Hindustan Petroleum Corp.,  India ’s third-largest
state refiner, according to two traders. The companies paid
about $25 a ton above Middle East benchmark prices for the fuel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
