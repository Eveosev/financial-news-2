Maritime pilots stopped guiding
vessels through the  Houston Ship Channel  after midnight because
fog reduced visibility at the largest U.S. petroleum port, the
Coast Guard said.  Pilots halted transits to the ports of Galveston and  Texas
City  at 12:01 a.m. local time today, Thomas Barbay, a Coast
Guard watch supervisor in Houston, said in an interview. Pilots
who guide ships to Houston suspended operations at 12:20 a.m.,
he said.  An advisory for dense fog is in effect for the area until 9
a.m., according to a notice posted by the  National Weather
Service  on its  website  at 3:37 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
