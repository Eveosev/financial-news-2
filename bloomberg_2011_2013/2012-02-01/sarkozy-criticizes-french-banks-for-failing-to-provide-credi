French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
criticized banks for failing to lend to companies, forcing the
government to fill the credit shortfall.  “To find financing for small companies, we had to create
OSEO,” he told a conference of entrepreneurs in Paris,
referring to a state-backed lending unit. “To find funding for
large industry, we have to create a bank for industry. You have
to question what banks are for.”  Sarkozy announced last month that he plans to create a
financing arm for French industrial companies.  Euro-area lenders tightened credit standards in the fourth
quarter and expect to make it more difficult to obtain loans in
the first three months of the year, the  European Central Bank 
said today. “The net tightening of credit standards by euro-
area banks surged in the fourth quarter,” the Frankfurt-based
ECB said, citing its quarterly Bank Lending Survey. “Looking
ahead, euro-area banks expect a further net tightening of credit
standards, albeit at a slower pace.”  Sarkozy said banks aren’t his “enemy,” in contrast to
Socialist Francois Hollande, who is leading Sarkozy in the polls
ahead of presidential elections in April and May. Hollande, in
his opening campaign speech, said “my enemy is finance.”  “Whenever there is a speculative burst, there’s abundant
credit and we create a real bubbles that explode,” Sarkozy
said. “But when we have a small company that wants to buy a
machine because it sees a market, it’s a battle to get a loan.
It’s not acceptable, and that’s not my idea of what banks are
for.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
