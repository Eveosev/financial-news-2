Norwegian manufacturing unexpectedly
rose for the first time in four months in January as orders and
production increased.  A seasonally adjusted  index  based on responses from
 purchasing managers  jumped to 54.9 from 46.6 in December, Oslo-
based Fokus Bank said today in a statement. The index was
forecast at 48, according to a Bloomberg survey of nine
economists. A reading below 50 signals a contraction.  The sub-index measuring orders rose to 57.9 from a revised
40 in December, the highest since August, according to the
survey. The employment index rose to 52.3 from a revised 44.9
and the production measure increased to 54.2 from 49.4.  Norway’s central bank in December unexpectedly cut its
benchmark  interest rate  by 50 basis points to 1.75 percent to
shield the world’s seventh-largest oil exporter from the fallout
of Europe’s debt crisis.  Norway ’s PMI Index was started by Fokus Bank in 2004 in
cooperation with the Association for Purchasing and Logistics.
Fokus is owned by Danske Bank A/S, Denmark’s biggest lender.  To contact the reporter on this story:
