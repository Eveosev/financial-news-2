Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) , looking to cut
costs while in bankruptcy, plans to give up naming rights to the
Kodak Theatre in  Los Angeles , which hosts the annual Academy
Awards show.  Kodak is seeking court permission to reject the sponsorship
contract because of the “significant annual cost savings” that
will come with doing so, the company said in court papers filed
yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.  Any benefit related to the naming rights “likely does not
exceed or equal the debtors’ costs associated with the
contract,” the company said.  The Kodak Theatre has hosted the Academy Awards since 2001,
according to the theater’s  website . The 84th awards show is
scheduled for Feb. 26. Kodak, based in Rochester,  New York ,
filed for bankruptcy last month.  The case is In re Eastman Kodak  Co., 12-10202,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan)  To contact the reporter on this story:
