Swiss stocks  rallied the most in four
weeks as a report showed that U.S. manufacturing expanded at a
faster pace in January.  Watchmakers led gains in the Swiss Market Index as Swatch
Group AG and  Cie Financiere Richemont SA (CFR)  climbed more than 3.5
percent.  Adecco SA (ADEN) , the world’s biggest supplier of temporary
labor, surged more than 6 percent.  Roche Holding AG (ROG) , the largest
maker of cancer drugs, declined 1.5 percent after posting
earnings that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The  SMI (SMI) , a measure of the largest and most actively traded
companies, advanced 1.7 percent to 6,069.91 at the close. in
Zurich, as every stock in the gauge gained apart from Roche. The
SMI posted its biggest rally since Jan. 3. The gauge rose 0.6
percent in January. The broader Swiss Performance Index added
1.6 percent today.  “While waiting for a solution to the European debt crisis,
markets are celebrating the small positive steps forward such as
this morning’s Chinese data,” Torben Hoeyer, the chief equity
adviser at Nordea Private Bank in Copenhagen, said in a note to
clients.  In the U.S., a report showed that manufacturing grew at a
faster pace last month. The  Institute for Supply Management  said
its  factory index  rose to 54.1 in January, the highest level
since June. The  median estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey of 81
economists was a reading of 54.5. Readings greater than 50
signal growth.  A separate report based on private payrolls showed that
U.S. companies added 170,000 workers in January, falling short
of the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of economists
by 12,000.  U.K., China, Germany  Other reports today showed global manufacturing picked up
in January, with factory indexes from  China  to Germany and the
U.K. showing growth.  Chinese manufacturing indexes rose in January as the
world’s second-biggest economy withstood weaker exports driven
by the euro-area debt crisis and a government-induced property
slowdown. The official  purchasing managers’ index  increased to
50.5 from 50.3 in December, exceeding the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey for a reading below the 50 level that
divides expansion from contraction.  Swatch Group AG (UHR) , the biggest maker of Swiss watches, gained
4.8 percent to 406.50 Swiss francs, its highest price since Aug.
2. Cie. Financiere Richemont, the second-largest luxury goods
maker that  generated half its sales  in  Asia  in the last fiscal
year, climbed 3.9 percent to 54.15 francs, its highest price
since July 14.  Greek Debt Talks  Greece  expects to complete talks on a private sector debt
swap and a second international financing deal for the country
in the next few days, government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis said.  “Significant steps” have been made on both fronts and
“we are close,” Kapsis told reporters in Athens today.  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , the biggest Swiss
lenders, advanced 3.4 percent to 12.96 francs and 4.5 percent to
24.96 francs, respectively. Swiss Re,  the second-biggest
reinsurer , climbed 3 percent to 51.45 francs.  Adecco, which generated a  fifth of sales  from the U.S. in
2010, surged 6.8 percent to 46.61 francs.  Roche fell 1.5 percent to 153.40 francs after posting
earnings per share excluding some items of 12.30 francs last
year. That missed the 12.46-franc  average estimate  of 26
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Revenue for the year dropped 10 percent to 42.5 billion
francs ($46.6 billion), hurt by the strength of the Swiss
currency against the dollar and euro. At constant exchange
rates, sales rose 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
