American International Group Inc. (AIG) ,
the bailed-out U.S. insurer, will pay reinsurer Transatlantic
Holdings Inc. at least $45 million to settle a dispute tied to
losses in  securities lending .  AIG may pay as much as $125 million, New York-based
Transatlantic said today in a statement distributed by  Business
Wire . The two companies are still in talks and will allow a
mediator to set the payment if an agreement isn’t reached.  The range is lower than the $350 million that Transatlantic
originally demanded in 2010. Transatlantic, previously
controlled by New York-based AIG, raised its claim to $500
million last year. AIG, which received a government rescue
valued at $182.3 billion, managed a securities lending program
that produced losses for  Transatlantic (TRH) , the reinsurer has said.  “We continue to close the books on crisis-era litigation
on fair and reasonable terms for our shareholders, including
U.S. taxpayers,” Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, said in an e-
mailed statement. “Resolving these cases allows AIG to continue
to focus on becoming the world’s most valuable insurance company
and allowing the taxpayers to recoup their investment in AIG at
a profit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
