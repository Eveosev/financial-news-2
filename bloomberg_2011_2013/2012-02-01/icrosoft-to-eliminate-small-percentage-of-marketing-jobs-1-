Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the world’s largest
software maker, said it’s eliminating a “small percentage” of
marketing jobs as part of a previously reported reorganization
of the department.  “Given the rapid changes in technology and the shifts in
how our customers connect with Microsoft, great marketing is
more important than ever to Microsoft’s future success,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement. “We’re taking steps to
improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing.”  The cuts follow a marketing review aimed at reducing
overlapping jobs and better responding to competitors like Apple
Inc. and Google Inc., people with knowledge of the matter told
Bloomberg last month.  Microsoft, based in Redmond,  Washington , spent $13.9
billion on sales and marketing in fiscal 2011, a 5.5 percent
increase from the previous year. Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer , who named  Chris Capossela  as his new marketing chief
last year, didn’t think the company was getting enough return on
those marketing dollars, the people said in January.  The software maker had 25,000 sales and marketing workers
as of June 30, the end of its  fiscal year , the company said in a
filing, without specifying how many focused on marketing. The
company had a total of about 90,000 full-time employees.  Microsoft  shares  rose 1.2 percent to $29.89 at the close in
 New York . The stock has gained 6.8 percent in the past 12
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
