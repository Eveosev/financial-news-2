Fiat SpA (F) , the Italian carmaker that
controls Chrysler Group LLC, forecast 2012 profit will surge as
much as 88 percent as the American carmaker’s earnings rise.  Earnings before interest, taxes and one-time items, which
Fiat calls trading profit, will increase this year to between
3.8 billion euros ($5 billion) and 4.5 billion euros from 2.39
billion euros in 2011, the Turin, Italy-based carmaker said in a
statement today. That compares with a 3.24 billion-euro estimate
for next year from 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Sergio Marchionne , chief executive officer of both
automakers, is counting on Chrysler to propel growth at Fiat,
whose volume brands lost about 500 million euros in  Europe  last
year as the region’s debt crisis causes consumers to hold back
on purchases. Chrysler today reported U.S. deliveries surged 44
percent in January, the 22nd straight monthly year-on-year gain.  “Marchionne aims to aggressively capitalize on the
spectacular recovery of the U.S. car market,” said Wolfram Mrowetz, chairman of investment firm Alisei SIM in Milan, who
bought Fiat shares earlier this week. “He’s betting on Chrysler
sales as Europe remains a problem.”  Fiat  rose  23 cents, or 5 percent, to 4.82 euros, the most
since Jan. 16, in Milan trading today. The shares have gained 36
percent in 2012, valuing the carmaker at 6.06 billion euros.  The group’s fourth-quarter trading profit more than doubled
to 765 million euros, beating an average estimate of 16 analysts
for profit to reach 759 million euros. Revenue also more than
doubled to 19.6 billion euros.  Chrysler Profit  Chrysler, which has been consolidated into Fiat’s results
since June, reported trading profit last quarter of 639 million
euros, offsetting a 15 million-euro loss at Fiat and its other
European volume car brands. Super-car marque Ferrari’s profit
slipped 11 percent to 100 million euros. Net income in 2011 for
the group more than doubled to 1.33 billion euros.  “All of it” came from the American carmaker, the CEO said
today of last year’s net income. “I have absolutely no
intention of supporting that nonsensical arrangement. That’s the
definition of what I call an unhappy marriage.”  Marchionne, who aims to merge Fiat with Chrysler by 2015
and boost revenue to more than 100 billion euros in 2014, is
looking for a third partner in Europe to increase efficiencies
and cut development costs in an effort to end the losses.
Marchione said today he hasn’t start yet any discussion with
potential partners.  “Fiat’s loss in the automotive business in the fourth
quarter comes as a shock to us,” said Erich Hauser, a Credit
Suisse analyst in  London  who’s ranked No. 1 by Bloomberg among
analysts who cover Fiat based. “The guidance for 2012 operating
profit is outlandish,” said Hauser, who confirmed his “sell”
rating on the shares.  Fiat, which owns 58.5 percent of Chrysler, is willing to
participate in an industry consolidation in Europe to compete
with  Volkswagen AG (VOW3) , the region’s biggest carmaker, Marchionne
said last month. Fiat led a decline in auto sales in Europe last
year with a 12 percent slump to 947,786 vehicles, according to
the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association in Brussels.  Marchionne said today that the purchase of the 41.5 percent
Chrysler stake owned by the United Auto Workers union’s retiree
health-care trust will be discussed in the second half.  Rising Debt  Net debt at the end of 2011 rose to 5.5 billion euros from
500 million euros after Fiat incorporated Chrysler’s debt, the
carmaker said today. Fiat expects debt to reach as much as 6
billion euros in 2012.  “Net debt is a key concern,”  Stuart Pearson , a Morgan
Stanley analyst in London, said in a note to investors Jan. 24
“The deep value within Fiat-Chrysler has always been in the
terminal value of a merged and restructured organization.
Unfortunately, 2012 is likely to see a step backwards from this
goal if cash concerns slow essential investment.”  To create the necessary car-making efficiencies, automotive
groups need to build from 8 million to 10 million vehicles a
year, Marchionne, 59, said in January in  Detroit . Currently only
 General Motors Co. (GM) , Volkswagen and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  are
producing at or near that level. Fiat and Chrysler sold about
half that figure last year.  Marchionne’s renewed interest in teaming up with another
company comes as he considers lowering his 2014 sales target to
5.7 million cars from a previous forecast of 5.9 million. Fiat
may globally lose 500,000 vehicle sales annually as a result of
the European debt crisis, he said last month. Fiat and Chrysler
deliveries will total about 4.9 million autos in 2014, based on
the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporters on this story:
