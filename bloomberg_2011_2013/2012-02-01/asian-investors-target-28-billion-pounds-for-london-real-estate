Asian investors have about 28 billion
pounds ($44 billion) in cash available for commercial-property
purchases in  London , more than any other group, Knight Frank LLP
said.  In total, overseas investors have about 40 billion pounds
to spend on income-producing offices and other non-residential
real estate in the U.K. capital, said Stephen Clifton, the
brokerâ€™s head of investment in the  City of London  financial
district. Middle East investors, the second-biggest group, have
8 billion pounds available, he said at a presentation today.  About a third of all of the investments in London
commercial real estate last year were by first-time buyers in
the city, Clifford said. Wealthy individuals including British
citizens now own 10 percent of all investment property in London
by volume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
