Pakistan  dismissed claims made in a
classified NATO report that it is aiding Taliban guerrillas in
neighboring  Afghanistan , a study that also said the militants
may again take power in Kabul once foreign troops leave in 2014.  “For me this is old wine in an even older bottle,”
Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar said at a press
conference in Kabul today. “I don’t think these claims are new.
I can just disregard this as potentially strategic leak.”  A report by senior NATO officers in Afghanistan says the
Taliban are unbeaten and “its strength, motivation, funding and
tactical proficiency remain intact,” the London-based Times
said today. The report, entitled “State of the Taliban,” was
based on 27,000 interviews with detainees and has been reviewed
by the newspaper, according to the Times.  A spokesman for the U.S.-led  International Security
Assistance Force , Brigadier General Carsten Jacobson, told the
 Associated Press  that the report was a summary of interrogations
and not based on an analysis of the intelligence available to
the military.  Pakistan is, the NATO report states, colluding with the
Taliban in directing attacks against coalition forces, using a
network of spies and intermediaries to provide strategic advice,
the newspaper said.  Members of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence agency
meet regularly with Taliban leaders and “relay any pertinent
concerns of the government of Pakistan,” though there is little
evidence from detainees that Pakistan provides funding or
weapons, according to the report, the Times said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
