Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind turbine
maker, won an order from Eolia Renovables SA to supply a 30-
megawatt wind farm in  Spain ’s Tarragona province.  Nordex signed a contract to deliver 12 of its 2.5-megawatt
machines to the Barbers project that is co-developed by  Elecnor
SA (ENO) , Hamburg-based Nordex said today in a statement, without
disclosing financial details. The wind farm, to be built on a
mountain ridge close to the coast southwest of Barcelona, will
be connected to the grid this summer, Nordex said.  Nordex installed 970 megawatts of turbines in 2011, an
increase of 9 percent from the previous year, the company said
on Jan. 26. Its biggest market is  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
