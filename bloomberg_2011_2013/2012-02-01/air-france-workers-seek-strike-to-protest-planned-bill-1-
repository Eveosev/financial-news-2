Air France SA unions for pilots,
cabin attendants and ground workers have called on the airline’s
employees to strike from Feb. 6 at 1:00 a.m. Paris time through
Feb. 9 to protest a bill going before the French senate that
would oblige each employee planning to strike to give 48 hours’
notice, the unions said in an e-mailed statement.  The unions said in the statement they didn’t necessarily
think the bill would be voted into law. Air France considers the
subject of guaranteeing services at airports a matter for the
state and is committed to preserving employees’ right to strike,
the carrier said in an e-mailed statement.  David Ricatte, a spokesman for the CGT union and a flight
mechanic said by telephone that he didn’t know how many workers
would join the strike and said workers would have a clearer idea
on Feb. 6. Air France is the French unit of Air France KLM
Group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
