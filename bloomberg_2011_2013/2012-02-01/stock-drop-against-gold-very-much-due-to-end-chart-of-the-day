U.S. stocks “hold out more promise
than gold” because the precious metal has surged for more than
a decade, according to Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup Inc.’s chief
U.S. equity strategist.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows the ratio between the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and the price of gold for immediate delivery
since 1928, when calculations for the index begin. The red line
depicts the direction for the past eight decades, and the gray
lines indicate when the ratio has been unusually high or low.  Levkovich drew his conclusion in a Jan. 27 report from a
similar chart, going back 125 years. The ratio fell to a low of
0.59 last year from a high of 5.55 in 2000, when gold started an
11-year run of annual gains, and was about 0.75 yesterday.  “Investors hiding out in gold have made a lot of money in
the past decade,” he wrote. Even so, the ratio has fallen far
enough out of line with the historical trend to show “that a
shift back toward equities is very much due.”  Since gold’s streak started in 2001, the price has risen
more than sixfold. The  S&P 500  is down 0.6 percent since the end
of 2000.  Gold is benefiting from concern that the dollar may lose
value, Levkovich wrote. The Dollar Index, a gauge of the U.S.
currency’s value against the currencies of six major trading
partners, has lost 28 percent since the beginning of 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
