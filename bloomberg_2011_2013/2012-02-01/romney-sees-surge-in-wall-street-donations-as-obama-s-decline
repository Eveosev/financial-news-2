Mitt Romney’s investment background,
criticized by some of his Republican presidential rivals, is
helping him build a financial advantage over them.  In the fourth quarter of last year, eight of the 10 biggest
donors to Romney, co-founder of Boston-based  Bain Capital  LLC, a
private-equity firm, worked for banks and investment funds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on U.S. Federal
Election Commission information released yesterday.  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  employees gave $196,600. Those at  JPMorgan Chase & Co .
donated $180,518, and  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  workers
contributed $106,580.  For the whole campaign, Goldman Sachs employees and their
families have been the largest source of campaign cash for
Romney, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington-based group that tracks political money. They have
given him almost half a million dollars; four years ago, they
gave $1 million to President  Barack Obama , according to the
center and FEC filings.  “ Wall Street  supports someone they consider one of their
own and the candidate perceived to be the most committed to
promoting policies they prefer,” said Costas Panagopoulos,
director of the Center for Electoral Politics and Democracy at
 Fordham University  in  New York .  Obama raised almost $16 million from employees in the
securities and investment industry and their families for the
2008 election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.  Bankers Go Elsewhere  After Obama championed new regulations designed to curb
abuses blamed for the worst economic downturn since the Great
Depression, Wall Street put its money elsewhere.  JPMorgan, whose employees gave $23,494 to the incumbent in
the last three months, was the only financial institution to
appear on Obama’s top 10 list for the fourth quarter.  Romney has pledged to repeal the regulations and touts his
experience at Bain in creating jobs. His Republican opponents,
most notably former House Speaker  Newt Gingrich , have argued
that he actually destroyed jobs while pocketing huge fees. A
film aired by a pro-Gingrich political action committee called
Romney a “corporate raider” who “began a pattern of
exploiting dozens of American businesses.”  The former Massachusetts governor, winner of last night’s
 Florida (BEESFL)  primary, raised $57 million last year for his campaign,
more than any other Republican candidate. Gingrich, who finished
second in Florida, raised $12.7 million, including $9.8 million
in the last three months.  Obama’s Small Donors  Obama, meanwhile, raised more money from small-dollar
donors than Romney raised overall, bringing in $58.5 million in
contributions of $200 or less.  The incumbent Democratic president took in a total of $128
million in 2011 for his re-election, including $40 million in
the last three months. He reported having $81.8 million in the
bank as of Dec. 31 -- four times Romney’s balance.  The president’s biggest source of donations in the fourth
quarter came from employees at the trial lawyer firm of Morgan &
Morgan PA, who gave $104,645. His largest corporate sources of
donations were employees at  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)   “At a time when the financial industry remains deeply
unpopular among a majority of Americans, a decline in
contributions may not be seen as a tragedy inside the Obama
White House,” said  Rogan Kersh , associate dean at New York
University’s Wagner School. NYU professors and other employees
gave $24,060 to Obama from October through December, his eighth-
biggest source of donations.  Industry Supporters  Obama still has some supporters in the industry. A Goldman
Sachs managing director, Bruce Heyman, raised more than $500,000
for the president’s re-election, the campaign said yesterday.  Romney’s support goes beyond campaign donations. Robert Mercer, co-chief executive officer of the hedge fund Renaissance
Technologies, and  Julian Robertson , co-founder and president of
hedge fund Tiger Management LLC, each gave $1 million to Restore
Our Future, a so-called super-political action committee
dedicated to electing Romney, in the last six months.  So did Paul Singer, president and founder of the New York-
based hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. Elliott employees gave
$106,025 to Romney’s campaign in the last three months.  Romney’s Lobbyist Fundraisers  Restore Our Future had already received $1 million
contributions from Edward Conard, a former colleague of Romney’s
from Bain Capital, and billionaire money manager  John Paulson  in
the first half of 2011. In the second half, five Goldman Sachs
employees gave a total of $385,000 to the super-PAC.  As required by federal law, Romney also disclosed to the
FEC the names of 14 lobbyists who raised $1.2 million for his
campaign by tapping their own source networks and urging
donations to the campaign or by hosting fundraisers, a practice
called bundling.  The group was led by Patrick Durkin of Barclays Plc, who
brought in $606,950; and Wayne Berman, whose clients include
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and brought in $177,475.  A Goldman Sachs lobbyist, Joseph Wall, raised $30,399 for
Romney. Wall lobbied on the new financial regulations, according
to his disclosure form filed with the Senate, as did another
lobbyist-bundler for Romney, Thomas Boyd of DLA Piper, who
raised $26,350 for the campaign.  No Lobbyist Donations  Obama doesn’t accept donations from registered lobbyists or
recruit them to bundle donations for his campaign. That may not
be a hurdle. Obama reported that the number of fundraisers
bringing in at least $50,000 increased to 445, from 351 at the
end of September.  He named 61 bundlers who raised more than $500,000, up from
41 in September. Obama is the only presidential candidate to
publicly identify all of the backers who are bundling donations.  Representative  Ron Paul  of Texas was the second-most
prolific Republican fundraiser, bringing in $26 million last
year, more than half of it, $13.3 million, in the last three
months. Slightly more than half of Paul’s money -- $13.6 million
-- came in donations of $200 or less. He entered January with
$1.9 million in the bank.  Gingrich entered January with $2.1 million in the bank. He
also reported debts of $1.2 million.  Gingrich paid off his own debt to himself. The campaign
reimbursed the former speaker more than $200,000 for travel and
paid him $47,005 for a mailing list, as well as $67,016 in
compensation to Gingrich Productions for web hosting.  Gingrich’s Daughter  From October through December, the Gingrich campaign paid
the consulting company led by his daughter, Jackie Gingrich
Cushman, $21,811 for consulting and travel. The campaign
previously paid Cushman Enterprises Inc. $34,321.  Gingrich, who won the South Carolina primary, raised
another $5 million last month, said R.C. Hammond, his campaign
spokesman.  Former U.S. Senator  Rick Santorum  of Pennsylvania raised
$2.2 million last year, including $920,428 in the fourth
quarter. He entered 2012 with $278,935 in the bank and debts of
$204,836.  Texas Governor Rick Perry, who dropped out of the
Republican race on Jan. 19 and endorsed Gingrich, raised $20
million last year and had $3.8 million in the bank at the end of
2011. He brought in $2.9 million in the fourth quarter, down
from $17 million in the previous three months.  Bachmann, Huntsman  Minnesota Representative  Michele Bachmann , who ended her
campaign Jan. 4, brought in $9.3 million last year, including
$4.8 million in amounts of $200 or less. Bachmann had $1.1
million in debt -- more than half of it owed to a telemarketing
firm -- and $358,725 in cash at the end of 2011.  Former Utah Governor  Jon Huntsman , who withdrew from the
race Jan. 16, had $3.8 million in debts at the end of 2011,
including $2.5 million he lent his campaign. Huntsman raised
$3.3 million, including $1.1 million in the fourth quarter, and
had $110,965 in the bank on Jan. 1.  Georgia businessman  Herman Cain  raised $11.2 million in the
fourth quarter and $16.9 million overall for his campaign, which
he ended in early December. He had almost $1 million still in
his account and owed $580,200 on Dec. 31.  Former Minnesota Governor  Tim Pawlenty , who withdrew from
the Republican race in August after finishing third in the Iowa
straw poll, raised more than $400,000 in the fourth quarter,
whittling his campaign debt to $102,911 -- little more than
double the $46,268 he had in the bank as of Dec. 31. He raised
$5.9 million last year for his campaign.  Pawlenty received financial help from Romney, whom he
endorsed in September, and Romney’s wife, Ann. They contributed
the maximum $2,500 each, as did 11 other Romney family members.  To contact the reporter on this story:
