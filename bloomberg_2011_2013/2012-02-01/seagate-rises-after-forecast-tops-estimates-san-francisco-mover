Seagate Technology Plc (STX) , the world’s
largest maker of computer disk drives, rose as much as 6.3
percent in late trading yesterday after forecasting higher
annual sales than analysts estimated.  Sales will be about $20 billion in calendar 2012, the
Cupertino, California-based company said on a conference call.
Analysts had predicted $17.5 billion, according to  data compiled
by Bloomberg .  Seagate has bounced back from last year’s floods in
 Thailand , which sidelined much of the disk-drive industry.
Unlike factories owned by competitors, Seagate’s plants weren’t
hit directly by floodwaters, helping it recover quickly.
Meanwhile, drive shortages have helped push up prices, giving a
boost to the company’s bottom line.  Fiscal second-quarter net income more than tripled to $563
million, or $1.28 a share, from $150 million, or 31 cents, a
year earlier, the company said yesterday in a statement. Sales
increased 18 percent to $3.2 billion in the period, which ended
Dec. 30.  Seagate climbed as high as $22.48 in extended trading after
the report was released. The shares, up 51 percent in the past
12 months, had closed at $21.14 earlier in the day.  Floodwaters engulfed much of the industrial heartland north
of Bangkok last year, hampering production of disk drives and
components.  Western Digital Corp. (WDC) , Seagate’s biggest rival, had
to close down production, though it too recovered more quickly
than investors had anticipated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
