The cost for European banks to borrow
in dollars fell for a second day to the lowest level in a week,
according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 70.5
basis points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:20 a.m.
in London, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest since Jan. 26 and compares with minus 74 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 62 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was unchanged. The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference
between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index swaps, held
at 76 basis points.  Lenders reduced  overnight deposits  at the European Central
Bank for the second consecutive day, placing 472 billion euros
($617 billion) with the Frankfurt-based ECB yesterday from 479
billion euros on Jan. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
