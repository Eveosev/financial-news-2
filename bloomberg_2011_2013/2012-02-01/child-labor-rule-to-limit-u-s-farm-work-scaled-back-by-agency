The U.S. Labor Department said it
will revise a proposal that would have barred children from
working the most dangerous tasks on farms, and will provide
broader exemptions for operations owned or run by their parents.  The agency in September proposed rules that would prevent
children younger than 16 from using most power-driven equipment
and block those younger than 19 from working in grain bins,
stockyards and feedlots. Agriculture groups sought the change,
saying the standards would upend a tradition of youngsters
working alongside their parents in the fields.  “The Department of Labor appreciates and respects the role
of parents in raising their children and assigning tasks and
chores to their children on the farms,” Labor Secretary Hilda Solis said today in an e-mailed statement.  The modification was hailed by the National Farmers Union,
the second-biggest U.S. farm group, which said the initial rules
might inadvertently exclude children from helping their parents
on farms as they have for generations, driving up costs.  “There should be safeguards to protect children from
dangerous situations, but there needs to be an understanding
that many children in rural communities learn about safety by
helping their family on the farm,” said Senator  Debbie Stabenow , a Michigan Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
