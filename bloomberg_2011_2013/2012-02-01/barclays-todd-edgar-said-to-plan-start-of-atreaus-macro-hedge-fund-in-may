Todd Edgar, former global head of
macro trading at  Barclays Plc (BARC)  in London, is starting hedge fund
Atreaus Capital LLC in May, according to a person familiar with
his plans.  Edgar, 39, is opening New York-based Atreaus with former
colleagues Peter Buschmann, Dmitri Shklovsky, Sinan Gumusdis and
Michael Ridewood, according to the person, who asked not to be
identified because the fund is private.  The firm, which will focus on commodities and foreign-
exchange trading, is starting with as much as $200 million from
the money-management unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., two
people with knowledge of the matter said in December.  Edgar and the four men have worked together for the past
seven years, first at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and then, from 2009
to 2011, at Barclays in  London . Edgar and Shklovsky had
previously been employed at Tudor Investment Corp., the
Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund run by  Paul Tudor Jones .  A sixth partner, Andrew Downes, will be Atreaus’s chief
operating officer, the person said. He most recently worked at
UBS Securities LLC in Stamford,  Connecticut .  Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for Atreaus, said he
couldn’t comment on the new fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
