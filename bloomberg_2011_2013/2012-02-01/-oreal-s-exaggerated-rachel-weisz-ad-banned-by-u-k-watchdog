The U.K.’s Advertising Standards
Authority banned a  L’Oreal SA (OR)  advertisement for being
misleading, the second time in six months the watchdog has
cracked down on ads by the world’s largest cosmetics company.  The two-page print ad for L’Oreal Paris Revitalift Repair
10 face cream, featuring a digitally retouched image of actress
Rachel Weisz, “misleadingly exaggerated” the product’s
performance in relation to its claims, the ASA said today in a
statement, adding that the ad cannot appear in its current form.  The ban follows a complaint by member of parliament Jo Swinson, a member of the Liberal Democrat party and co-founder
of the Campaign for Body Confidence, a lobbying group focused on
depictions of women. The ASA last year prohibited L’Oreal ads
featuring actress  Julia Roberts  and supermodel Christy Turlington for similar reasons after complaints by the MP.  “The beauty and advertising industries need to stop
ripping off consumers with dishonest images,” Swinson said in a
statement. “Images can be aspirational, without being faked.”  A L’Oreal spokesman said the company doesn’t believe the ad
exaggerates the effect that can be achieved using the product,
adding that the claims are based on scientific research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
