King & Spalding LLP , an international
law firm of more than 800 lawyers, hired Abraham N.M. “Hap”
Shashy, Jr., the head of the Washington tax practice at  Dewey &
LeBoeuf LLP .  Shashy, 62, who was managing partner of the Washington
office of New York-based Dewey, was the chief counsel of the
 Internal Revenue Service  for three years, appointed by President
 George H.W. Bush  in 1990. Previously a lawyer at Atlanta-based
King & Spalding, he’ll rejoin the firm’s Washington office as a
partner and chairman of the global tax practice group, the firm
said in a statement today.  “We look forward to his help in building up our tax
controversy practice and expanding the firm’s tax capacity in
our offices outside the  United States ,”  James H. Lokey, Jr.,
the outgoing tax practice group leader, said in a statement.
Lokey, an Atlanta-based partner, will continue the full-time
practice of tax law at King & Spalding, the firm said.  In fiscal 2010, King & Spalding was the 33rd-largest
grossing law firm, with more than $718 million in revenue,
