Chile’s peso strengthened for the
first time in three days as higher copper prices boosted trade
prospects for the metal’s biggest producing nation.  The peso appreciated 0.8 percent to 487.65 per  U.S. dollar 
as of 9:42 a.m. in Santiago, from 491.55 yesterday.  European stocks and U.S. equity futures rose ahead of an
Institute for Supply Management report that may show U.S.
manufacturing grew at a faster pace in January. Copper gained as
much as 0.9 percent in  New York  after indexes in  China , the
biggest customer for Chile’s copper, and  India  showed
manufacturing increased.  “They’re forecasting very good data for the ISM survey in
the U.S.,” said Ronald Volpi, head of spot currency trading at
EuroAmerica Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “The market is
positioned to sell dollars, but it’s worth being cautious and
waiting for the data.”  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market
reduced short positions in the peso to $4.1 billion on Jan. 30,
according to central bank data that shows a $2 billion flow from
dollars into pesos in the first month of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
