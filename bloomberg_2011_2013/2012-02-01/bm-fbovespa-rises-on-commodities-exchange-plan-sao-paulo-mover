BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of  Latin
America ’s biggest securities exchange, rose to the highest price
in eight months on speculation the Brazilian government may
stimulate the commodities market.  BM&FBovespa gained 5 percent to 11.54 reais at the close of
Sao Paulo trading, the highest since May 13. The benchmark
Bovespa index rose 2.4 percent.  Brazil  may create a commodity derivatives exchange similar
to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange or spur trading at the
BM&FBovespa to increase volume and attract investors, Sao Paulo-
based  Valor Economico  reported, citing an unidentified person
from the government’s economic team.  “The government’s intention appears to be an opportunity
for BM&FBovespa, rather than a threat,” analysts Regina Sanchez, Alexandre Spada and Thiago Batista, from Banco Itau BBA
SA, wrote in a note to clients today. Boosting BM&FBovespa’s
soft commodities market would be “the fastest, safest and
cheapest way to expand soft commodities trading locally,” they
said.  “The news surprised me in a positive way,” BM&FBovespa
Chief Executive Officer Edemir Pinto told reporters at an event
in  Sao Paulo  today. “This would help solve liquidity issues and
establish fairer prices for agricultural commodities in
Brazil.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
