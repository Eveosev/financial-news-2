A task team set up by  South Africa â€™s
Department of Mineral Resources to investigate hydraulic
fracturing will submit its report to Cabinet on March 31,
 Business Day  reported, citing court documents filed on behalf of
Mineral Resources Minister Susan Shabangu.  It was impossible to say when the report would be released
to the public as the department has no control over the Cabinet
process, the Johannesburg-based paper said, citing Shabangu.
Exploration for shale gas by so-called fracking has been halted
in South Africa until the end of February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
