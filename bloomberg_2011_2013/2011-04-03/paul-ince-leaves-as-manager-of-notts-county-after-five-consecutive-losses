Former Manchester United and
England player Paul Ince left his post as Notts County manager
“by mutual consent” after five straight defeats, the third-
tier English soccer team said.  Ince, 43, took the job in October and has been unable to
fulfill the club’s hopes of challenging for the playoffs. The
team is 19th in the standings, two points above the relegation
zone.   “When we sat down to discuss the matter with Paul, it
became clear that we were in agreement that a parting of the
ways would be the best way forwards for all parties,’ club
Chairman Ray Trew told the team’s website.  In June 2008, Ince became the Premier League’s first black
English manager when he took charge at Blackburn. His coaching
career also includes spells at Macclesfield and MK Dons.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
