Egypt  will investigate violence
after soccer fans stormed the pitch during a match between
Egypt’s Zamalek and  Tunisia ’s Club Africain in Cairo, the
Cabinet said on its Facebook page, citing the prime minister.  “I apologize to the Tunisian people and the Tunisian team
for the unrest,” Prime Minister Essam Sharaf was cited as saying
today. “The issue will be immediately investigated.”  Crowds invaded the field in Cairo yesterday toward the end
of the African Champions League match to protest the referee’s
decisions, the Interior Ministry said in a statement on its
Facebook page. A number of players, fans and security officials
fainted or suffered minor bruises, the statement said. The
violence caused damages to the stadium and a number of police
