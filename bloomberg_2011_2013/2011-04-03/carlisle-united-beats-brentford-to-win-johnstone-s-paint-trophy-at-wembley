A goal by defender Peter Murphy gave
Carlisle United a 1-0 victory over Brentford in the Johnstone’s
Paint Trophy final at Wembley today.  Murphy slammed the ball into the net following a 12th-
minute corner, and Brentford was unable to turn second-half
pressure into goals before a crowd of more than 40,000.  Brentford’s Toumani Diagouraga, who’d already been
cautioned, was dismissed for a second yellow card three minutes
from the end after a foul on Tom Taiwo.  Carlisle was losing finalist to Southampton last year in
the competition, which is open to clubs in the third and fourth
tiers of English soccer. The Cumbrian team previously won the
trophy in 1997 when the event was under different sponsorship.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
