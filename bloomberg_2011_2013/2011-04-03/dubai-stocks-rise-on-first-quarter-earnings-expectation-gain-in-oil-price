Egypt stocks climbed to the highest
level since January, led by  Six of October Development &
Investment (OCDI)  Co., on investor speculation declines in real-estate
shares last month were overdone given growth prospects.  Six of October, a luxury developer, jumped 8 percent,
trimming the drop since trading resumed March 23 after an almost
two-month suspension to 15 percent.  Palm Hills Developments SAE (PHDC) ,
a Cairo-based property company, gained for the first time in 10
trading days. Egypt’s  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  advanced 1.7 percent to
5,558.64 at the 2:30 p.m. close in Cairo. The index has lost 1.6
percent since trading resumed. Dubai’s measure fell today, while
Israel’s benchmark index rose 0.8 percent.  “Real-estate stocks are attractive as they have become
extremely discounted,” said Ashraf Akhnoukh, senior equity
sales trader at Cairo-based Commercial International Brokerage.
“The sector was the worst performer since the market resumed
trading.”  The EGX 30’s 22 percent plunge this year has left the index
valued at 1.5 times book value, compared with about 1.9 times at
the end of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Palm Hills  has
tumbled 43 percent since trading resumed and  Talaat Moustafa
Group (TMGH)  Holding, Egypt’s biggest publicly traded real-estate
developer, has slumped 28 percent. Neither the EGX 30 nor the
broader EGX 100 have subindexes, according to data on Bloomberg.  Trading in Egypt was halted since the end of January until
last month amid protests that ousted former president  Hosni Mubarak  in February.  ‘Attractive Risk’  Amer Group Holding (AMER) , which develops hotels, malls and
restaurants, gained 4.4 percent today to 1.44 pounds, trimming
the drop since the end of January to 23 percent. Beltone
Financial initiated the shares with an “add” recommendation
and a price estimate of 2.8 pounds. “The stock has been over-
penalized,” Beltone analysts Harshjit Oza and Ahmed Khalil
wrote in a note March 31. “The stock offers an attractive risk
reward at the current price.”  Six of October soared to 68.46 pounds. Palm Hills surged
8.1 percent, the most since March 2009, to 2.79 pounds and
Talaat rose 4.4 percent to 4.73 pounds.  In the  Persian Gulf , the  Bloomberg GCC 200 Index (BGCC200) ,  Abu
Dhabi ’s  ADX General Index (ADSMI)  and Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  gained 0.1
percent. Oman’s  MSM30 Index (MSM30)  rallied 1 percent, while Bahrain’s
BB All Share Index fell 0.5 percent and Kuwait’s measure dropped
0.4 percent. Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  and Saudi Arabia’s
 Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  retreated 0.1 percent.  In Israel, the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit government bond
due January 2020 was little changed, with the yield on the 5
percent note falling 1 basis point to 5.25 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
