Spanish Deputy Prime Minister
Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba is the favorite to succeed Prime
Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero as the Socialists’
candidate in 2012 elections, according to a poll in  El Pais .  Forty-two percent of Spanish voters think Rubalcaba would
be the strongest candidate, while support rises to 52 percent
among Socialist voters, according to the March 30-31 poll.
Zapatero announced yesterday he won’t run in next year’s
election.  Defense Minister Carme Chacon is considered the strongest
candidate by 17 percent of those polled, while only 15 percent
of Socialist voters back her, the poll showed. Chacon has the
best approval rating in the government at 18 points, three
points ahead of Rubalcaba, according to a gauge that measures
the difference between voters’ positive and negative ratings of
ministers.  The opposition  People’s Party , led by Mariano Rajoy, would
win 44.1 percent of the vote if general elections were held now,
compared with 28.3 percent for the Socialists, El Pais said. The
poll, which had a 3.2 point margin of error, shows the PP’s lead
narrowed by 0.1 percentage point from a month earlier.  El Pais based the poll results on 1,000 interviews, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
