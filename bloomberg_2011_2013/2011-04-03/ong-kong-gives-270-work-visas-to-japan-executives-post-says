Hong Kong  granted 270 work visas for
top professionals formerly based in Japan in two weeks after the
March 11 earthquake, the  South China Morning Post  said, citing
Director of Immigration Eric Chan.  An unprecedented fast-track approval system was put in
place so that the department is able to approve the work visas
in two days, the Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper said.  Most of the visas were given to senior managers of
multinational companies in Japan, mainly in the financial
industry, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
