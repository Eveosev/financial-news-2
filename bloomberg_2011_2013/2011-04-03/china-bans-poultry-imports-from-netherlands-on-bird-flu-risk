China  has banned imports of poultry
from the Zeeland province of the Netherlands, where an outbreak
of the H7N1 bird flu was reported last month, China’s quality
inspector said.  Any poultry or poultry products sent by mail or carried by
travelers coming from the European nation will be returned or
destroyed, the General Administration of Quality Supervision,
Inspection and Quarantine and the Ministry of Agriculture said
in a joint  statement  dated yesterday. The restrictions began
yesterday, according to the statement posted on the central
government’s website today.  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Ken McCallum, Lena Lee  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
