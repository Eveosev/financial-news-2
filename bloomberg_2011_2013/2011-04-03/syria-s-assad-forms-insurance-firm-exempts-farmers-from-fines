Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
issued a decree to form a joint-stock company for health
insurance, the  Syrian Arab News Agency  said.  Cham Company has 500 million pounds ($10.5 million) of
financing from the Syrian General Insurance Company, the Syrian
Holding Investment Company and the General Organization for
Social Insurance, the  news agency  said.  In addition, the president issued a decree giving retired
military and public sector employees health insurance, with the
state budget covering 62.5 percent of the annual premium, and
the retiree the rest, it said. Assad also moved to exempt
farmers from fines imposed for irrigation fees between 1997 and
2000, the news agency said.  Syria’s president granted more heating allowances and other
benefits amid a wave of protests that have left dozens dead.
