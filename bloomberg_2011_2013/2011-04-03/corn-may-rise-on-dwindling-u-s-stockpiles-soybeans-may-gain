Corn may rise after the government
said U.S. inventories left from last year’s crop on March 1 were
smaller than expected. Soybeans may rise as U.S. farmers intend
to cut the area planted to a three-year low.  Twenty-three of 29 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to Chicago on April 1 said corn will advance this week, and 19
forecast a gain for soybeans. Last week on the Chicago Board of
Trade, corn futures for May delivery jumped 6.7 percent to $7.36
a bushel. May soybean futures gained 2.6 percent to $13.9375 a
bushel.  Last week’s advances in corn and soybeans were expected by
the majority of respondents surveyed on March 25. Since 2004,
the surveys have been correct 56 percent of the time for corn,
and 53 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 23    Bullish on soybeans: 19
Bearish on corn:  6    Bearish on soybeans: 10  To contact the reporter on this story:
