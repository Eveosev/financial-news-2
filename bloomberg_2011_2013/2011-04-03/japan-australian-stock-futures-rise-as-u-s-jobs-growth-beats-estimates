Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose after a report showing U.S. jobs grew faster than
forecast and a weakening yen boosted optimism in an economic
recovery.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , which receives
28 percent of its revenue from the Americas, gained 1.3 percent
from its closing share price in Tokyo. Those of  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, rose 1.1 percent. ADRs of
 Sony Corp. (6758) , which receives 70 percent of its sales outside Japan,
climbed 0.5 percent. ADRs of  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) ,
Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas producer, gained　1.2
percent in New York trading after  oil prices  climbed.  “The U.S. jobs data had recovered more than expected, so
investors risk tolerance will increase,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , a market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “The yen
is reacting to the jobs data, and this should be a plus for
exporters.”  Yen-denominated futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
expiring in June closed at 9,805 in Chicago on April 1, compared
with 9,700 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid at 9,810 in the pre-
market in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.7 percent today and New Zealand’s NZX
50 Index was little changed in Wellington.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index rose 0.5 percent on April 1, adding to
gains from the market’s biggest first-quarter rally since 1998,
as faster-than-forecast jobs growth bolstered optimism and
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. started a bidding war for NYSE Euronext.  U.S. Employment  A U.S. government jobs report showed the U.S. unemployment
rate dropped to a two-year low of 8.8 percent in March from 8.9
percent in February. Payrolls grew by 216,000 workers after a
194,000 gain the prior month, the Labor Department said.
Economists projected a March gain of 190,000, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The yen depreciated to as low as 84.38 against the dollar
today, compared with 83.55 at the close of  stock trading  in
 Tokyo  on April 1. A drop in the yen increases the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  Crude oil for May delivery advanced as much as 0.6 percent
to $108.60 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 1.7 percent this year
through April 1, compared with gains of 6 percent by the S&P 500
and 1.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.7 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
