Residents of  New Orleans  remained
three-times more likely to suffer a heart attack for years after
 Hurricane Katrina  hit in 2005, killing about 1,000 people and
scattering the city’s population.  The first long-term look at the hurricane’s impact on
health in the region found 2.2 percent of 29,228 patients
admitted to  Tulane University  Hospital in the four years after
Katrina experienced a heart attack, compared with 0.7 percent of
the 21,229 hospitalizations two years earlier. Researchers
presented the findings today at the  American College of
Cardiology  meeting in New Orleans.  Psychiatric conditions such as depression, bipolar and
anxiety disorders seemed to increase the risk, which the study’s
lead researcher Anand Irimpen is calling “Post-Katrina Stress
Disorder.” While those illnesses didn’t have a significant
effect on heart attack rates for the first two years after
 Hurricane Katrina , there appears to be a delayed impact that is
now taking hold, he said in a statement.  “To our surprise, the persistent three-fold increase in
heart attack risk has occurred in the absence of any change in
traditional risk factors, for example age, high  blood pressure ,
obesity and diabetes,” said Irimpen, associate professor at
 Tulane University’s Heart and Vascular Institute . “Certainly
chronic stress appears to play an ongoing role.”  Many patients haven’t returned to their original homes or
jobs and aren’t taking care of their health, according to
Irimpen, who is also chief of cardiology at Southeast Louisiana
Veterans Health Care System. The post-Katrina heart attack
patients were more likely to be unemployed, have no insurance,
smoke and report substance abuse, the researchers found.  To contact the reporter on this story:
