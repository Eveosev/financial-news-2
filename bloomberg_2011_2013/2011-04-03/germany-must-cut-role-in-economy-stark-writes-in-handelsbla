The German government needs to
reduce its role in the economy, European Central Bank Executive
Board member  Juergen Stark  writes in  Handelsblatt .  Stark called for the amount of  government spending  as a
percentage of the economy to return to pre-crisis levels, the
newspaper reported in an advance release of an article to appear
tomorrow.  Germany needs to consolidate its budget because it has a
stabilizing role for the euro area, Stark wrote in Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
