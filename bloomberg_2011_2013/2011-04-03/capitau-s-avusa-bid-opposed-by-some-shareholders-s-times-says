Shareholders owning about 20 percent
of  Avusa Ltd. (AVU)  are against a 2.7 billion-rand ($403 million) bid
for the South African media company by Capitau Holdings Ltd.,
the Sunday Times said, citing Gavin Wood, chief investment
officer for Kagiso Asset Management, which holds a 12.5 percent
stake in Avusa, and Rob Forsyth, head of industrials at Investec
Asset Management, which holds about 5 percent of Avusa.  Capitau already has the backing of three major shareholders
in  Mvelaphanda Group Ltd. (MVG) ,  Coronation Fund Managers Ltd. (CML)  and
Universal Hirt & Carter, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
