About 1,200 Bank of Ireland Plc
employees have signed letters to Chairman Pat Molloy expressing
“outrage” at bonus payments to the bank’s senior management,
the  Sunday Business Post  reported.  The letter states that no further bonuses should be paid
until the bank can “honor the entitlements of all staff,” the
Dublin-based paper reported, citing a statement from the Irish
Bank Officials Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
