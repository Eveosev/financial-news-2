The U.K. will send a Royal Navy
taskforce of 600 marines and at least six ships to  Libya  this
week as part of a humanitarian mission to provide medical and
food aid to rebel-held towns, the London-based Times reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The marines, who are due to fly out to Gibraltar later this
week, will be used to protect ports where supplies will be
unloaded, the  newspaper  reported in its paper copy today. The
ships in the taskforce, which are due to leave in the next two
days, will include the landing platform  Albion , the type-42
destroyer Liverpool and four support ships, the Times said.  Britain is also under pressure to double the number of
Royal Air Force planes available to attack the Libyan army after
yesterdayâ€™s withdrawal of U.S. combat aircraft, the newspaper
reported, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
