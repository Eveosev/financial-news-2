Edinson Cavani got three goals as
Napoli twice rallied to defeat Lazio 4-3 and go second in
Italian soccer’s Serie A.  Stefano Mauri and Andre Dias put Lazio 2-0 up yesterday
before the home team leveled through Andrea Dossena and Cavani.
Salvatore Aronica’s own goal gave Lazio a 3-2 lead and Cavani
then scored twice more to complete the comeback win.  The victory lifted Napoli to 62 points, three behind leader
AC Milan, as it seeks a first Italian league championship since
 Diego Maradona  led the club to the 1990 title.  “We try to win every game and to do our best and the
points will be counted up at the end of the season,” Cavani
told Italy’s Sky Sport. “That’s the right way to behave.”  AC Milan defeated city rival Inter 3-0 two days ago and has
65 points with third-place Inter on 60. Fourth-place Udinese
remains on 56 after a 2-0 loss at Lecce yesterday.  In Spain, leader Barcelona won 1-0 at Villarreal two days
ago and Real  Madrid  was upset 1-0 by Sporting Gijon. It was a
first home league-match defeat in more than nine years for
Madrid coach  Jose Mourinho , the last coming when he was at
Porto.  Barcelona has 81 points, Madrid 73, Valencia 57 and
Villarreal 54.  Borussia Dortmund  kept its seven-point lead in  Germany  with
a 4-1 win over Hanover two days ago. Second-place  Bayer
Leverkusen  won 1-0 at Kaiserslautern.  The game between St. Pauli and Schalke three days ago was
abandoned in the 88th minute after an assistant referee was hit
by a plastic cup of beer thrown from the crowd. Schalke led 2-0
at the time and is likely to be declared the winner after an
inquiry.  Lyon Stunned  Lyon let in two goals in the last four minutes to draw 2-2
at Nice yesterday and miss the chance to go second in  France .
Kim Kallstrom and Lisandro Lopez gave Lyon a 2-0 half-time lead.
Eric Mouloungui got a 90th-minute penalty for Nice and Renato
Civelli made it 2-2 in the third minute of injury time.  Marseille won 1-0 at Lens last night to move into second
spot with 54 points, four behind leader Lille.  In the  Netherlands , FC Twente beat PSV Eindhoven 2-0 to
take top spot on 63 points. PSV has 61 and Ajax 58 after a 3-0
win over Heracles Almelo.  WEEKEND RESULTS
