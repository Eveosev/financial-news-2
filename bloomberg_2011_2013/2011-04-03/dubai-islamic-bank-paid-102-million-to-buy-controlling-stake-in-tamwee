Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  paid 374.7
million dirhams ($102 million) to buy a controlling stake in
 Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL)  as the  United Arab Emirates ’ biggest Islamic lender
sought to boost mortgage financing in Dubai.  Dubai Islamic paid 318.6 million dirhams in cash and 56.1
million dirhams in treasury shares for the stake, according to
the bank’s annual report distributed on March 31. The lender in
September raised its share in Tamweel to 58.3 percent from 21
percent, without disclosing the value of the transaction.  The deal implies a payment of 1 dirham for each Tamweel
share, according to Bloomberg calculations. Tamweel’s shares
last traded at 0.99 dirham on Nov. 20, 2008, when they were
suspended pending a reorganization. They had a book value of
2.23 dirhams at the end of December, Tamweel’s results show.  "I was anticipating a payment of 0.7 dirham a share, so
the acquisition is certainly more expensive than I had
expected,"  Raj Madha , a Dubai-based analyst at Rasmala
Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today. "What is
more interesting about the transaction though is the funding
guarantees that Tamweel received which will help its longevity."  Tamweel and Amlak Finance PJSC, another Dubai-based Islamic
mortgage company, halted lending after the global credit crisis
blocked their access to funds. The U.A.E. federal government set
up a committee in 2008 to study the revival of the two
companies, which had relied on market borrowings to fund their
mortgages. Tamweel began lending again from Nov. 1.  Fair Value  Dubai Islamic Bank also revalued each Tamweel share to 2.7
dirhams after a valuation of the company, according to the
report. As a result, the bank booked a fair value gain of 637
million dirhams from the acquisition in 2010.  "The gain has no real impact on my valuation; it doesn’t
add to Dubai Islamic Bank’s cash flows, doesn’t affect its
ability to pay dividend and doesn’t add to regulatory capital,"
Madha said.  Shares of Dubai Islamic Bank, in which the Dubai government
holds a 30 percent stake, gained 1.4 percent to 2.25 dirhams at
1:33 p.m. in Dubai today. The stock has gained 3.2 percent this
year compared with a 4.5 percent decline in the benchmark Dubai
Financial Market General Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
