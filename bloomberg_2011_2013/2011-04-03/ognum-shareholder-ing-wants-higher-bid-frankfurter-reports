ING Groep NV, which holds 9 percent
of  Tognum AG (TGM) , said a joint bid by  Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Rolls-Royce
Group Plc (RR/)  undervalues the German engine maker, Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung  reported , citing a letter from the bank to
Tognum’s management.  ING sees a so-called fair value for Tognum at 27 euros
($38.44) to 29 euros per share, with Rolls-Royce’s Bergen unit
adding another 3 euros, the paper said. Daimler and Rolls-Royce
have said they plan to offer 24 euros per share for Tognum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
