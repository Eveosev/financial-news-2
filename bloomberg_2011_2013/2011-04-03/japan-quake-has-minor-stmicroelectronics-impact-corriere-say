Last month’s earthquake in Japan is
having little impact on  STMicroelectronics NV (STM) , Europe’s largest
chipmaker,  Corriere della Sera  reported, citing an interview
with the company’s Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti.  The short-term impact is “minor,” although the situation
in post-earthquake Japan is still uncertain, Milan-based
Corriere cited Bozotti as saying.  STM is keeping its first-quarter guidance despite seeing
some risks for sales in the first and second quarters following
the Japan quake, a company spokesman said on March 16.  -- Editors: Linda Shen, Ana Monteiro  To contact the reporter on this story:
