The biggest increase in profits in
more than a century is telling investors that this is no time to
sell stocks, even after the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied
97 percent.  S&P 500 earnings are poised to surpass the 2007 peak of $90
a share in the third quarter after surging from $7 in March
2009, the quickest recovery since at least 1900, according to
data from S&P and  Yale University ’s  Robert Shiller  compiled by
Bloomberg. The gap between projected 12-month profits and
average earnings over the last 10 years is set to widen the most
since 1951, the data show.  PNC Wealth Management, Federated Investors Inc. and ING
Investment Management, which together oversee about $1 trillion,
say consumer spending will sustain the recovery after government
stimulus helped lift profits from the lowest level since the
Great Depression. While earnings will slow in the second half,
stock purchases by investors who missed the S&P 500’s advance
will fuel gains, according to Leuthold Group LLC.  “People are more comfortable with the recovery than at any
time over the last couple of years,” said Doug Ramsey, the
Minneapolis-based director of research at Leuthold Group, which
oversees $3.9 billion and recommended buying equities four days
before the bull market started. “That’s typically when retail
investors regain courage,” and may spur a rise of up to 25
percent in the S&P 500 during the next 18 months, he said.  Biggest Since 1937  The S&P 500 rose 1.4 percent to 1,332.41 last week,
bringing its 2011 advance to 6 percent and putting it 0.8
percent away from this year’s high of 1,343.01 on Feb. 18. It
slumped through March 16 following  Japan ’s record earthquake and
civil unrest in the Middle East and northern  Africa . The gauge’s
gain since March 9, 2009, is the most over comparable periods
since 1937, according to S&P’s  Howard Silverblatt . The index
climbed less than 0.1 percent at 4 p.m. in  New York  today.  Shares haven’t kept up with earnings. S&P 500 companies’
12-month profits are projected to reach a record $91 a share by
August, according to estimates compiled by S&P and Bloomberg.
That would be the highest-ever level on an inflation-adjusted
basis and up almost 13-fold from their low two years ago, S&P
and Shiller data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Rebound in Profits  The 50-month rebound in profits, following a 92 percent
drop during the global financial crisis, would be faster than
the 52 months it took to recover from the bursting of the dot-
com bubble in 2000, when earnings fell 55 percent, the data
show. Profits didn’t recoup their 67 percent tumble during the
Great Depression until 19 years later.  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , the New York-based
insurer bailed out by U.S. taxpayers, has posted the biggest
turnaround since March 2009. AIG swung from a trailing 12-month
loss of $95.8 billion to net income of $7.79 billion, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ConocoPhillips in Houston earned $11.4 billion last year
after losing $20.3 billion in the 12 months through March 2009,
the data show. The third-largest U.S. oil company may report a
22 percent gain in first-quarter net income and a 9 percent
decrease for all of 2011, analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  has boosted net income to $16.6 billion from
$7.25 billion in March 2009. The Cupertino, California-based
maker of iPads is projected to grow net income 54 percent in its
fiscal year ending in September, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. Apple is set to report second-quarter results on April 20.  Earnings Season  AIG shares have surged 497 percent since March 9, 2009,
while Apple jumped 315 percent and  ConocoPhillips (COP)  rallied 118
percent.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , which rebounded 224 percent, starts the
earnings reporting season on April 11. The New York-based
aluminum producer may post a 268 percent increase in first-
quarter net income, according to the average of five analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The S&P 500 trades for 13.7 times estimated 2011 earnings,
compared with an average of 15.7 times reported annual profit
since 1900, Shiller data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Earnings for the measure will total $95.21 this year,
according to S&P’s estimate when adjusted for inflation using
the median economist projection for the  consumer price index  in
a Bloomberg survey. If that forecast is met and the 12-month
price-earnings multiple climbs to its mean since 1900, the S&P
500 would rise 12 percent to end December at 1,494, or 4.7
percent away from its record of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007.  Analysts’ Forecasts  S&P 500 profit has topped analysts’ average forecasts eight
straight quarters, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Inflation-adjusted profits for the index will climb 22 percent
in 2011, estimates compiled by S&P and Bloomberg show.  Shiller, whose book “Irrational Exuberance” foreshadowed
the end of the 1990s surge in stocks, said in an interview that
U.S. equities are “expensive.” The S&P 500’s cyclically
adjusted price-earnings ratio, a valuation measure popularized
by Shiller that is calculated by dividing the index’s price by
the average inflation-adjusted earnings during the past 10
years, is 41 percent higher than the average since 1900.  “I view current market conditions as a great opportunity
to take risk off the table,” said Rob Arnott, founder of
Research Affiliates LLC, which oversees $75 billion in  Newport
Beach ,  California . “When markets are expensive, you’re better
off letting somebody else bear the risk to pick up that last
nickel in front of the steamroller.”  Stimulate the Economy  Profits are being inflated by government attempts to
stimulate the economy that won’t last, and earnings will
eventually “mean revert,” or fall back toward average levels,
according to Arnott, who prefers emerging-market bonds and
short-term corporate debt.  The  Federal Reserve  has kept its benchmark interest rate at
a record low near zero since December 2008. Federal government
spending accounted for about 24 percent of gross domestic
product last year, within 2 percentage points of the highest
level since 1945. The budget gap widened to a record $222.5
billion in February.  Should earnings match analysts’ forecasts next quarter,
they’ll be about 59 percent higher than the 10-year average. The
only other times since 1951 that the gap approached that level
was in December 2006 and August 2000, near the peaks of U.S.
profit and economic expansions, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  That won’t kill the rally, said E. William Stone, who
predicted the 2009 gain in stocks and helps oversee about $108
billion as the Philadelphia-based chief investment strategist at
PNC Wealth Management.  Economic Data  U.S. economic data are surpassing expectations this year by
the most since 2004, based on the average level of Citigroup
Inc.’s Economic Surprise Index, a gauge of how much reports are
exceeding economist estimates in Bloomberg News surveys.  “Evidence is building that we have a self-sustaining
recovery,” said Stone. “There are corporate profits. There’s
the fact that  consumer spending  is there. Things are getting
better.”  U.S. consumer purchases rose more than forecast in
February, while a Labor Department report on April 1 showed
employers created more jobs than estimated in March and the
 unemployment rate  fell to a two-year low of 8.8 percent.  The world economy will probably expand 4.4 percent this
year and 4.5 percent in 2012, according to January forecasts
from the Washington-based  International Monetary Fund .  Private Demand  Private demand may spur growth after more than $12 trillion
pumped into the financial system by governments and central
banks lifted the global economy out of its first contraction
since World War II, according to Linda Duessel, the equity
market strategist at Federated Investors, which oversees $358.2
billion.  “We see accelerating growth around the globe,”Duessel,
who turned bullish on U.S. stocks at the beginning of 2009, said
in an interview from Pittsburgh. “That helps to continue to
propel earnings. This market looks cheap to us.”  Sixty-six percent of S&P 500 companies that have reported
results topped sales forecasts last quarter, up from 62 percent
in the previous period, a sign that demand may take over from
cost cutting as a driver of profits, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Revenue has “surprised to the upside in these last several
quarters,” Duessel said. “Sales are going to be propelled by
employment.”  Buybacks, Dividends  The recovery in demand is spurring executives to spend the
record $940 billion in cash they built up after the financial
crisis. S&P 500 companies authorized 38 percent more buybacks in
2011 than a year earlier and dividends may increase to a record
$31.07 a share in 2013, data compiled by Birinyi Associates Inc.
and Bloomberg show.  That’s boosting confidence among mutual fund investors who
sold shares during most of the  bull market . U.S. equity funds
attracted about $12 billion of inflows since December, compared
with $134 billion of redemptions during the previous six
quarters, according to Investment Company Institute data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Individual investors “are way underweight equities,” said
Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of  asset allocation  for ING
Investment Management, which oversees $550 billion and boosted
stock holdings in April 2009. “The market is nowhere even close
to being priced to perfection.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
