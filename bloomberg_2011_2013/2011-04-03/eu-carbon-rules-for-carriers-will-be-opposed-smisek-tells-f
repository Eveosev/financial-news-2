Chief Executive Officer Jeff Smisek said the European Union’s
plan to apply its carbon emission rules to airlines from outside
the bloc is “inappropriate” and “exceeds the legal authority
of the European Union,” the Financial Times reported, citing an
interview.  “There’s universal belief among all international carriers
on the same topic,” and the plan is sure to challenged by a
government outside the EU, Smisek said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
