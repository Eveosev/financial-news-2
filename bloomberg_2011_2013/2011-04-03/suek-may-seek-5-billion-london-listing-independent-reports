Siberian Coal Energy Co. may start
trading its shares on the London Stock Exchange, valuing
 Russia â€™s largest producer of coal for power stations at about $5
billion, the  Independent on Sunday  said.  The company, which is 50 percent owned by Russian oligarchs
Andrei Melnichenko and Sergei Popov and known as Suek, decided
to offer a full trade of shares so that it could qualify for a
FTSE 100 listing, the London-based newspaper reported, without
saying how it got the information. Suek last year planned to
trade only global depository receipts, it said.  Suek believes it has improved its structure and corporate
governance, the newspaper said. Credit Suisse Group AG and
Citigroup Inc. are acting as advisors, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
