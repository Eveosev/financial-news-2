British financial-services firms’
activity grew strongly for the third successive quarter,
according to a survey by the  Confederation of British Industry .  A third of those surveyed said the volume of transactions
increased in the three months to March 30, according to a report
by the CBI and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, following similar
growth in the previous two quarters. Still, 12,000 financial-
services jobs were lost in the quarter and 4,000 will go in the
next three months, CBI spokesman Stephen Cooke said.  “A third quarter of strong volume growth shows the
financial-services recovery is building strength,” Ian McCafferty, the CBI’s chief economic adviser, said in a
statement.  U.K. financial firms are recovering after the credit
crisis. HSBC Holdings Plc, Barclays Plc and Standard Chartered
Plc, three of Britain’s biggest banks, had combined profits of
14 billion pounds last year, excluding asset sales, up from 8.3
billion pounds in 2009.  The CBI and PwC surveyed 94 banks, customer-owned lenders,
investment managers and securities firms from Feb. 24 to March
10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
