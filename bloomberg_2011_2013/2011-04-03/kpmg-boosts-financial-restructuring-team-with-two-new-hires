KPMG Europe LLP, the global
accounting services and advisory firm, said it hired Colin Haig
and Richard O’Dwyer as London-based restructuring partners.  Haig joins from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and O’Dwyer
from Grant Thornton International Ltd., KPMG said today in
a statement. Higher  interest rates  could prompt a wave of missed
payments in 2012,  Standard & Poor’s  said in a March 8 report.
Lenders wrote off 6.5 billion euros ($9.2 billion) of senior
leveraged loans in 2009, according to  Fitch Ratings .  “Financial restructuring in the U.K. will be driven by the
economic impact of public sector spending cuts and tax
changes,” O’Dwyer said in the statement.  “The global refinancing needed over the next four years -
with some estimates quoting up to 1 trillion pounds ($1.6
trillion) of debt - will not necessarily all be completed on a
voluntary basis and indeed we are expecting a substantial
tranche to go through involuntary restructuring,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
