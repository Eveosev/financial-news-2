NYSE Euronext (NYX)  Chief Executive
Officer Duncan Niederauer prefers  Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) ’s merger
offer over a competing bid by  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) , Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported , citing unidentified people
close to the company.  Niederauer is working up papers in support of a deal with
Deutsche Boerse, arguing that the tie-up with the Frankfurt
exchange operator offers better growth and profit prospects
because of its international scope, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
