Treasuries are signaling that the
$9 trillion market will weather the end of the  Federal Reserve ’s
quantitative easing program in June without suffering a selloff
that drives long-term borrowing cost higher.  The class of investors that includes foreign central banks
purchased 60 percent of the $66 billion in benchmark 10-year
U.S. notes sold this year, up from 42 percent in 2010. Fed data
show banks have increased their holdings of Treasuries to the
most since December, as a panel of bond dealers and investors
that advises the government says lenders may double their stake
to $3.2 trillion in 2016.  Rising demand from international investors and financial
institutions bodes well for bonds with the Fed’s plan to buy
more than $600 billion of Treasuries more than 80 percent
complete. U.S. fixed-income assets are retaining their appeal as
the credit quality of European sovereign debt deteriorates and
banks meet tighter risk standards governing the capital they
need cushion against losses.  “Foreign investors are going to continue to come to the
U.S.,” said Robert Tipp, the chief investment strategist for
fixed income at  Newark , New Jersey-based Prudential Investment
Management, which oversees more than $200 billion in bonds.
“The liquidity aspect is not to be underestimated. If past is
prologue, cessation of large scale asset purchases is likely to
prove bullish” for longer-maturity Treasuries, he said.  Losses Slow  Even with the Obama administration selling record amounts
of debt to finance a budget deficit exceeding $1 trillion,
losses on U.S. Treasuries slowed to 0.14 percent last quarter,
from 2.67 percent in the final three months of 2010, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose two basis
points to 3.46 percent as of 10:16 a.m. in  London , according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the 3.625 percent
security due February 2021 fell 4/32, or $1.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 11/32.  Treasury 10-year yields will hold below 4 percent through
year-end, according to the median forecast of more than 60
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Completion of the Fed’s purchases “should have limited
effect as net fixed-income supply declines and the demand is
picked up by foreign investors and households,” fixed-income
strategists at London-based  Barclays Capital  wrote in a report
dated April 1. The firm is one of the 20 primary dealers that
trade with the central bank.  ‘Little Value’  Bill Gross , who runs the world’s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., is avoiding Treasuries
anyway. Gross, who manages the $237 billion Total Return Fund
from  Newport Beach ,  California , said last week in his monthly
commentary on the firm’s website that Treasuries “have little
value” because of the record U.S. debt burden.  Marketable Treasury debt outstanding has more than doubled
from $4.5 trillion in August 2007 at the start of the financial
crisis. President  Barack Obama ’s 2012 budget forecasts the U.S.
will run a third consecutive deficit exceeding $1 trillion.  Removing the biggest buyer of Treasuries as the Fed winds
down its $600 billion, second round of so-called quantitative
easing, or QE2, is bound to drive yields higher, according to
Donald Ellenberger, who oversees about $6 billion as co-head of
government and mortgage-backed securities at Federated Investors
in Pittsburgh.  Inflation Expectations  “We’re getting signals from a lot of members of the Fed
that there’s not going to be a QE3, which will lead to yields on
Treasuries rising faster than for other debt,” he said.  The Fed voted in November to buy Treasuries to avoid
deflation, or a general decline in consumer prices, by pumping
cash into the financial system and increasing the flow of
credit. Central bank data show it purchased $488 billion of  U.S.
debt  through last week.  Since the vote, inflation expectations as measured by bond
prices have risen and the economy has strengthened.  Yields on 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
show investors forecast an average rate of inflation of 2.53
percent during the life of the debt, compared with a 15-month
low of 1.5 percent in August. Labor Department data show the
economy has created 723,000 jobs while the  unemployment rate 
fell to 8.8 percent last month from 10.1 percent in 2009.  “We could pull up a little bit shy of our total of $600
billion,” St. Louis Fed President  James Bullard  told reporters
at a conference in Prague on March 29. “I think it could be on
the order of $100 billion less than what we initially thought.”  End of QE1  In its first round of bond purchases the Fed bought $1.7
trillion of mortgage and Treasury securities in 2009 and the
first quarter of 2010. Within three months of that program
ending, 10-year yields fell to 2.93 percent from 3.83 percent.  The same may happen again if the absence of the Fed’s cash
leads investors to back away from riskier assets such as stocks
and speculative-grade bonds, according to Prudential’s Tripp.  Even with the Fed printing cash and the  budget deficit 
exceeding $1 trillion, U.S. assets has attracted investors
seeking refuge from  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis, which has
forced Greece and Ireland to seek bailouts from the European
Union and  International Monetary Fund .  The dollar’s share of global currency reserves stood at
61.4 percent at the end of 2010, little changed from 61.5
percent in 2009, the IMF in  Washington  said March 31. The euro’s
share dipped to 26.3 percent from 27.9 percent.  Foreign Holdings  Foreign investors owned $4.45 trillion of Treasuries as of
January, up from $3.7 trillion a year earlier, according to the
government.  China , the largest overseas lender to the U.S., held
$1.15 trillion of the debt in January, up from $889 billion a
year earlier.  Japan ’s stake grew 16 percent to $885.9 billion.  Bank holdings of Treasuries and agency debt rose $1.64
trillion as of March 23, approaching the record high of $1.65
trillion on Dec. 1, the Fed said at the end of last week.  A Feb. 1 report by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory
Committee, which includes representatives from firms ranging
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Soros Fund Management LLC, said
demand from banks may total an additional $1.6 trillion through
2016 as regulatory changes require them to add more lower-risk
assets to cushion against losses.  The  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision , appointed by
the Swiss government, proposed rules in October requiring banks
to increase available capital and better measure and control
their lending risk under the so-called Basel III rules. Banks
would be able to hold Treasuries because their safety and
liquidity makes them suitable capital under regulations designed
to prevent a repeat of the global financial crisis.  Term Premium  A financial model created by economists at the Fed that
includes expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation
suggests 10-year notes are fairly valued.  The so-called term premium was 0.81 percent on April 1,
compared with the 0.7 percent average the past decade. The
measure ranged from as high as 1.7 percent in December 2001,
just before Treasuries gained 11.6 percent in 2002, to as low as
negative 0.51 percent in December 2008, just before they posted
a loss of 3.72 percent for 2009.  Investors bid about $2.99 for each dollar available of the
$534 billion of notes and bonds sold at government offerings
this year, equaling record demand at the 2010 sales, and up from
$2.50 in 2009, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Fiscal and monetary stimulus “was a role that the
government had to play in the darkest days of the recession and
financial markets crisis, and we’re dealing with the
repercussions,” said Wan-Chong Kung, who helps oversee more
than $100 billion as a portfolio manager at Nuveen Asset
Management in  Minneapolis . “With economic growth and recovery,
it looks like we’re on a sustainable footing, and that should
speak well to what the government did and will continue to do.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
