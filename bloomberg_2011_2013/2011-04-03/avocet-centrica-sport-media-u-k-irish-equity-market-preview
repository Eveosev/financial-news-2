U.K. stocks advanced for a second
day, extending the benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) ’s biggest back-to-
back weekly rally since September, amid speculation that the
global economic recovery is strengthening.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s largest primary silver producer,
rallied 2.9 percent as silver advanced to the highest price
since 1980.  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  surged 5.3 percent after saying it will
supply Tokyo Electric Power Co. with emergency power, after the
Japanese utility’s Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant was damaged
by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami.  The FTSE 100 rose 7.06, or 0.1 percent, to 6,016.98 at the
4:30 p.m. close in London. The measure rallied 1.9 percent last
week as better-than-forecast U.S. jobs data boosted optimism in
the global economic recovery. The  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  increased
0.2 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index added 0.4 percent.  “Last week’s U.S. data will have helped dispel some of the
recent concerns on the strength of the underlying economy,”
said Graham Bishop, a London-based European equity strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. “We continue to believe the
economic cycle is supportive of equity markets, and see
continued appeal in developed markets.”  The FTSE 100 has climbed to within 1.5 percent of this
year’s highest level as concern eased that  Japan ’s strongest
earthquake on record and revolts in the Middle East and north
 Africa  will curb global economic growth. The gauge has soared 71
percent, or 87 percent including reinvested dividends, since its
March 2009 low as the global economy recovered from recession
and corporate profits beat estimates.  Fresnillo, Aggreko  Fresnillo jumped 2.9 percent to 1,611 pence as the price of
silver rallied.  Aggreko Plc surged 5.3 percent to 1,678 pence after saying
it will supply Tokyo Electric Power Co. with 200 megawatts of
emergency power, both diesel- and gas-fired.  Tesco gained 1.2 percent to 393.8 pence as Credit Suisse
Group AG advised buying shares of the U.K.’s largest supermarket
chain before the company reports 2010 earnings on April 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
