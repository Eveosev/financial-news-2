Fifty-nine U.S. public university
presidents were paid more than $500,000 last year as state
institutions of higher education facing budget cuts raised
tuition, slashed programs and furloughed employees.  E. Gordon Gee, president of  Ohio State University  in
Columbus, was the highest-paid leader of a public college in the
year ended June 30, 2010, with total compensation of $1.32
million, according to a  survey  of 185 heads of universities and
state college systems released today by the Chronicle of Higher
Education. Gee, 67, was the best-paid president in fiscal 2009.  State colleges and universities have faced declining
revenue as tax collections fell during the recession and states
cut education budgets. The  University of California  system
raised tuition 32 percent in 2009 and required faculty to take
unpaid days off. The University of  Washington  in Seattle
eliminated 850 jobs while Washington State University, in
Pullman, eliminated minors and major in dance and theater after
dropping the program. State presidents have to walk a
“tightrope” to explain their compensation, said Jeffrey
Selingo, editor of the Chronicle.  “On one hand, they’re trying to justify their salaries
while they’re trying to fight back cuts to their budget,”
Selingo said April 1 in an interview. “The argument they’re
making is that, in the large scheme, their salary is a speck in
these large public university budgets and that it’s unfair to
attack their salaries.”  Sharing Sacrifices  Some university presidents are making gestures to show
they’re sharing in the sacrifices made by their employees,
according to the Chronicle’s report.  Ohio  State’s Gee donated
his bonus to pay for scholarships and other university programs
in the 2009-2010 year, as he did the previous year, according to
the Chronicle.  After Gee, the highest-paid public school leaders were
Francisco Cigarroa, chancellor of the  University of Texas 
System, who was paid $750,000, and William Powers, president of
the University of  Texas  at Austin, who made $746,738.  The Chronicle also calculated the presidents’ total cost to
their states, which includes deferred compensation. Gee led that
measure as well, costing Ohio $1.81 million, followed by
Washington’s Mark Emmert, who cost that state $905,004, and
Cigarroa, who cost Texas $813,892. Emmert left Washington last
year to become head of the  National Collegiate Athletic
Association .  To contact the reporter on this story:
