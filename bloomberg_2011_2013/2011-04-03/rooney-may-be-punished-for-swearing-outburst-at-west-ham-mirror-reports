Manchester United and England
striker  Wayne Rooney  may face disciplinary action from the
Football Association after his foul-mouthed outburst during
yesterday’s 4-2 win at West Ham, the  Sunday Mirror  reported.  Rooney scored three goals as United recovered from 2-0 down
to go seven points clear at the top of soccer’s Premier League.  As he celebrated his third goal, Rooney swore into a
television camera at the side of the playing field, his words
clearly audible to a worldwide TV audience, the newspaper said.  In a club statement, Rooney apologized “for any offense
that may have been caused by my goal celebration, especially any
parents or children that were watching.”  “Emotions were running high, and on reflection my heat-of-
the-moment reaction was inappropriate,” he added. “It was not
aimed at anyone in particular.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
