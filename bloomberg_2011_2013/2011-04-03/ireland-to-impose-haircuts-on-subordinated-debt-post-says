Ireland’s government will impose
haircuts on the holders of subordinated debt in the country’s
banks as it seeks to lower the cost of rescuing its banking
sector, the  Sunday Business Post  reported.  An “aggressive” buy-back program may seek to recoup 5.5
billion euros ($7.83 billion) of the total 6.6 billion euros of
subordinated debt held in Ireland’s banks, the Dublin-based
paper said, citing people it didn’t identify by name.  To contact the reporter on this story:
