The yield on  Israel ’s 10-year
government bond declined for a fourth day amid expectations for
higher  interest rates  over the next year as the central bank
seeks to return inflation to the government’s target range.  The yield has dropped 10 basis points since the  Bank of
Israel  unexpectedly raised the base lending rate by a half-
percentage point to 3 percent on March 28 as inflation
accelerated and growth surged. It was the first increase of its
size since 2005 and put the rate at the highest level since
November 2008. February prices jumped an annual 4.2 percent, the
most in more than two years, and above the 1 percent to 3
percent target for the second month.  “The market is still recovering from the big rate increase
and is pricing in inflation expectations,” Assaf Rosenberg, a
trader at Excellence Nessuah Investment House Ltd., said by
telephone. “Consumer prices are expected to rise over the next
three or four months, but there is uncertainty about how much
the central bank will lift borrowing costs.”  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 gained,
pushing the yield down 1 basis point to 5.25 percent at the 4:30
p.m. close in Tel Aviv.  Governor  Stanley Fischer  will likely raise the rate another
two times by 25 basis points each, bringing the benchmark rate
to 4 percent by year end, Rosenberg said.  The economy will grow at a faster pace this year than
previously estimated, the central bank said March 30, revising
its growth forecast to 4.5 percent from 3.8 percent. Growth
accelerated to an annualized 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter
as exports, fixed investment and  consumer spending  climbed, the
Central Bureau of Statistics said on March 10.  The shekel strengthened 0.4 percent to 3.4646 per dollar on
April 1, the highest level since October 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
