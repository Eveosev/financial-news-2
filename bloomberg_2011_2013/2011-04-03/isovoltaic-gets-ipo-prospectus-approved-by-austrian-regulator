Isovoltaic AG, an Austrian solar
company, had a prospectus outlining details of its planned
public share offering approved by the countryâ€™s Financial Market
Authority.  The company plans to offer 17,995,000 shares and list a
total of 39,999,998 shares on the Vienna exchange, according to
a regulatory filing in the official gazette of Wiener Zeitung.  The company on March 25 started gauging investor interest
for the initial public offering, according to terms of the deal
obtained by Bloomberg News at the time.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  and  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  are joint global coordinators
and bookrunners in the sale.  Lebring, Austria-based Isovoltaic, which produces
backsheets for solar photovoltaic modules, said last month it
was planning to float 45 percent of the company, with only
existing shares being sold. The offer may raise as much as 300
million euros ($427 million), two people with knowledge of the
plans said in January.  Isovoltaic is scheduled to hold a press briefing tomorrow
in Vienna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
