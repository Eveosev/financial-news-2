Soho House U.K. Ltd., which runs a
chain of luxury private-members clubs, may be put up for sale
after receiving  takeover approaches  in the last week, the Sunday
Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the information.  Soho House received a number of offers from private equity
investors, one valuing the company at 300 million pounds ($483
million), the newspaper said. A formal process hasnâ€™t begun,
according to the article. Richard Caring, who owns 80 percent of
Soho House, declined to comment, the Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
