Manchester United manager  Alex
Ferguson  will remain at the 18-time English soccer champion for
two more years, The People reported, without saying where it got
the information.  The 69-year-old, who took charge at Old Trafford in 1986,
has told the club’s owners, the Glazer family, and Chief
Executive Officer  David Gill  that he has no immediate plans to
quit, the newspaper said today.  Ferguson, who previously said he’d quit before he turns 70,
may eventually be replaced by Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho,
the People said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
