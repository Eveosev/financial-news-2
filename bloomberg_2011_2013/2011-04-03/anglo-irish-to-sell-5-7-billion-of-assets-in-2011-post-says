Anglo Irish Bank Corp. plans to sell
“at least” 4 billion euros ($5.7 billion) of assets this year,
the Sunday Business Post reported, citing an interview with
Chief Executive Officer  Mike Aynsley .  The bank has already sold 1 billion euros of assets this
year, the Dublin-based newspaper said. Aynsley, who said he
doesn’t expect more asset sales in Ireland until the second half
of the year, won’t turn to the state for extra capital,
according to the article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
