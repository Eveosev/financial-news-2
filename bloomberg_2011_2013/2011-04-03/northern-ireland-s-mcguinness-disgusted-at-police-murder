Northern Ireland ’s deputy first
minister Martin McGuinness said he is “disgusted” by bombers
who killed a policeman in the U.K. region yesterday will be
“rejected overwhelmingly” by Irish people.  “For him to be killed in this way is something that I
think will be rejected overwhelmingly by the vast majority of
the people of Ireland,” McGuinness said in an interview with
broadcaster RTE today. “I am absolutely disgusted at this
murder.”  The policeman, named as 25-year-old Ronan Kerr by the
Police Service of Northern Ireland, was killed yesterday when a
bomb exploded under his car outside his home in Omagh, a town
about 70 miles west of Belfast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
