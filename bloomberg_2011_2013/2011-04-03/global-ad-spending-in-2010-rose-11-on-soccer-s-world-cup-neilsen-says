(Corrects Nielsen spelling in headline of story published
April 3.)  Nielsen Holdings NV, the New York-
based information and analytics company, said global advertising
rebounded in 2010 as the  World Cup  “propelled” spending.  Advertising across the world rose 10.6 percent to $503
billion last year, according to an e-mailed statement today. Car
ads jumped the most, increasing 20 percent, and the Middle East
and Africa were the fastest-growing region, gaining 27 percent
in 2010. Growth in the U.S. was 5.6 percent, making it one of
the slowest-expanding regions, the statement said.  “The 2010 FIFA World Cup brought the attention of hundreds
of millions of soccer fans, and not surprisingly, advertisers
followed with significant spending,” Randall Beard, global head
of advertiser solutions, said in the statement. “Advertisers
are already thinking about how they’ll capitalize on next year’s
 Olympic Games  in London.”  The figures are based on published rate cards from
Nielsen’s Global AdView Pulse report, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
