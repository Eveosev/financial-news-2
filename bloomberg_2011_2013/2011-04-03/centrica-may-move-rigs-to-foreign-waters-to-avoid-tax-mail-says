  Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.â€™s biggest
energy supplier, may move its gas exploration rigs to Norwegian
and Dutch waters to avoid tax on the  North Sea , the  Financial
Mail on Sunday  reported.  Treasury officials have been warned that Centrica is
considering whether it should go ahead with its planned 700
million-pound ($1.1 billion) investment in the North Sea, the
London-based newspaper reported, without saying where it got the
information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
