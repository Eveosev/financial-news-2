England’s David Horsey won a three-
man playoff at golf’s Hassan Trophy in Agadir,  Morocco , today to
claim his second European Tour title.    The 25-year-old birdied the second extra hole to beat last
year’s champion Rhys Davies of Wales and  South Africa ’s Jaco van
Zyl.  Horsey, who collects a check for 250,000 euros ($356,000),
led both players before hitting a double-bogey at the 18th hole
of his final round to finish on 13-under-par 274. His round also
included a hole in one at the second.  South Africa’s George Coetzee finished two shots further
back in fourth, while Thomas Bjorn of Denmark finished in a tie
for 15th after hitting a course-record 62 today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
