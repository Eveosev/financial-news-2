A British nuclear-powered submarine,
 HMS Vengeance , is returning to port after a mechanical fault, a
U.K. Ministry of Defense spokesman said.  Vengeance, one of the Royal Navy’s four Vanguard class
submarines that make up Britain’s nuclear deterrent, suffered a
mechanical defect on the night of March 31 and is now returning
under her own power to the naval base at  Faslane , Scotland, said
the MoD spokesman, who declined to be identified by name because
of government policy. There is no danger to crew and the
incident was not nuclear, he said, without elaborating.  Vengeance was commissioned into service in 1999 and has a
crew of 141.  Another U.K. nuclear-powered submarine, HMS Astute, had to
be rescued after running aground off  Scotland ’s Isle of Skye
during sea trials in October. Another submarine, HMS Trafalgar,
was damaged when it ran aground during a training exercise in
November 2002.  To contact the reporter on this story:
