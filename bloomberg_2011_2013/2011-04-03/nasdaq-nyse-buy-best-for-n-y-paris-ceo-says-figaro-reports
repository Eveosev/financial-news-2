The offer by  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) 
and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. to acquire  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  is
the “best for  New York  and for Paris,” Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq
chief executive officer, said, Le Figaro reported, citing an
interview with Greifeld and Jeff Sprecher, the CEO of ICE.  Le Figaro cited Greifeld as saying that Nasdaq’s merger
with OMX should be compared with NYSE’s link-up with Euronext:
“We have consolidated Stockholm as a financial center,” he
said, according to the newspaper. NYSE Euronext has centralized
activity in  London , he said, adding that “we want to reverse
this tendency,” Le Figaro reported.  Jeff Sprecher, the CEO of ICE, said, “For us, it is
logical that Paris should be the center for settlement and
delivery of stock market proceedings,” the newspaper said.      Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
