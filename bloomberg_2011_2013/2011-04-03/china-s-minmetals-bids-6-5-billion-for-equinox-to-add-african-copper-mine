Minmetals Resources Ltd. (1208) , the Hong
Kong unit of China’s biggest metals trader, made an unsolicited
offer of about C$6.3 billion ($6.5 billion) in cash for  Equinox
Minerals Ltd. (EQN) , to gain control of  Africa ’s largest copper mine.  Minmetals bid C$7 a share, 23 percent more than Perth-based
Equinox’s closing price in Toronto on April 1, the Hong Kong-
based company said today in a statement. The Chinese-funded bid
depends on Equinox, whose shares rose 28 percent in Sydney today,
dropping its C$4.4 billion offer for  Canada ’s Lundin Mining Corp.  The deal, China’s biggest minerals takeover, would give
Minmetals Chief Executive Officer Andrew Michelmore control of
the Lumwana copper mine in  Zambia  and  Saudi Arabia ’s biggest
copper deposit. Mining companies are competing to secure assets
after a dearth of new global projects and demand from China
drove copper prices to a record this year.  “The Minmetals bid could prompt another interested buyer
to put forward an alternative proposal,” said  Angus Gluskie ,
who manages about $350 million at White Funds Management Pty. “
“An improving global economic outlook is giving buyers the
confidence that prices should remain firm for some time.”  Minmetals, a unit of state-owned  China Minmetals  Group,
traded at HK$6.56 on April 1, giving it a market value of
HK$19.5 billion ($2.5 billion). Equinox rose A$1.58 to A$7.29
(C$7.30) at 11:15 a.m. in Sydney trading, the highest since June
22, 2004. The company’s board will meet to consider the offer,
it said in a separate statement.  Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN)  shares were
up 3.5 percent at C$8.33 at the April 1 close of trading on the
Toronto stock Exchange.  China Spending  Chinese companies spent more than $30 billion last year
buying mining assets and oil deposits to help secure raw
material supplies to feed the nation’s growing economy.
Minmetals owns the world’s second-biggest zinc mine and other
assets in  Australia ,  Laos  and Canada. Michelmore said in January
he was targeting copper, lead and zinc mines.  “Prospective bidders for Equinox Minerals may be reticent
to become involved in a bidding war with Chinese interests,”
said  Tim Schroeders , a Melbourne-based money manager at Pengana
Capital Ltd., which manages about $1 billion.  The offer premium of 33 percent to the volume weighted
average Equinox share price of the past 20 days compares with an
average premium of 24 percent for resources deals of at least
$500 million during last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Key Areas  “It fits perfectly into the key areas we want to grow in,
extending our mine life, expanding our portfolio of regions,
leveraging on our management and technical expertise to extract
value and most importantly it’s supported by our majority
shareholder,” Michelmore said during a media conference call.
Minmetals has been studying Equinox for “well over a year” and
built a 4.2 percent stake in the company during 2010.  The Hong Kong-based company is offering 11.3 times earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization compared
with the average of 7.2 times EBITDA in 10 comparable deals from
2007 to 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange traded at a record $10,190 a metric ton on Feb. 15 and
is expected to rise as mine shortages curtail supply.  “The global recovery is becoming more broad-based and
you’re not going to see any new mines coming on stream for at
least this year,” said Christin Tuxen, a Bloomberg top-ranked
analyst at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen. “You’ve got to be
bullish copper for the next few years.”  Faster Cheaper  For miners, mergers and acquisitions are a faster, cheaper
route to production than constructing projects from scratch,
Standard Chartered Plc said last year in a report. The cost of
building a  copper mine  has more than doubled in the past five
years, according to the report.  “The costs of acquiring mining leases and building mine
infrastructure have escalated materially over recent years, and
in many cases it is now cheaper to buy an existing business than
develop capacity internally,” said White Funds’ Gluskie.  Producers haven’t kept pace with demand because reserves
are becoming harder to find and ore quality is declining,
meaning less copper is extracted from each ton of rock.  Minmetals Resources is advised by Deutsche Bank AG and
Macquarie Capital Advisors.  The offer requires approval from Chinese and Australian
regulators. Minmetals lodged an application with Australia’s
Foreign Investment Review Board on March 11, Michelmore said.  Minmetals is seeking to acquire a minimum of two-thirds of
its target’s outstanding shares. Minmetals completed the $1.85
billion cash and share acquisition in December of parent company
 China  Minmetals’s Australian unit.  All financing for the proposed deal will be arranged with
Chinese banks through a combination of existing cash reserves,
long-term credit facilities and equity, including investments in
Minmetals by Chinese institutions, the company said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story: Elisabeth Behrmann in
