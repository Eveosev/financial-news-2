U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will announce a pause of up to three months to the government’s
proposed Health and Social Care Bill, aimed at reforming the
country’s  National Health Service , the Independent reported.
The delay to the progress through Parliament of Health Secretary
Andrew Lansley’s bill will allow more time to consult
clinicians, patients and lawmakers amid criticism that it will
privatize the state-run NHS “by the back door,” the newspaper
reported today on its  website , without saying where it got the
information.  The bill includes proposals to give 80 billion pounds ($129
billion) of health spending to family doctors and the
replacement of NHS primary care trusts and strategic health
authorities in England with doctor-led groups, the newspaper
said. That has drawn criticism from lawmakers in Cameron’s
 Conservative Party  as well as the Liberal Democrats, the junior
partner in his coalition government, the Independent said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
