Canada Prime Minister Stephen Harper
said today his Conservative government would double the amount
of the C$500 ($520) tax credit to encourage children’s physical
fitness, and extend the credit to adults, if he wins the May 2
elections.  Harper also said he would act on this promise during the
government’s next mandate, speaking to reporters in Ottawa.
Extending the measure to adults would cost C$275 million a year,
while doubling the credit for children would cost $30 million,
according to a document sent by the Conservatives by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
