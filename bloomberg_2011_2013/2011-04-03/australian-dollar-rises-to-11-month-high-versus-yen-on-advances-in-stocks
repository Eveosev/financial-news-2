highest in 11 months against the yen as a report showed a gauge
of inflation remained above the central bank’s target range
before policy makers meet tomorrow.  The Aussie earlier touched a record high against the
greenback even as economists forecast the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia will keep  interest rates  unchanged. New Zealand’s
dollar touched the strongest level since November versus the yen
after prices advanced for commodities, which account for a
majority of the nation’s exports, and Asian stocks extended a
worldwide rally.  “The market’s theme has been shifting from risk-on, -off
stories to the divergence in monetary policies,” said Kengo Suzuki, manager of the foreign bond department in  Tokyo  at
Mizuho Securities Co. “Although the RBA is unlikely to raise
interest rates tomorrow, it has been preemptive enough to offer
attractive yields to investors compared to its U.S. or Japanese
counterparts.”  The Aussie fell 0.4 to 86.98 yen at 12:29 p.m. in  New York ,
from 87.32 yen after reaching 87.70 yen, the strongest since May
