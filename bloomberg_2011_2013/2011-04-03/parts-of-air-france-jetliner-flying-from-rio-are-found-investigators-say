The French air-crash investigation
agency, BEA, has identified pieces of an aircraft found in an
underwater search over the past 24 hours as parts of Air France
Flight 447, BEA said in an e-mailed statement today.  BEA said a team on board the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution vessel Alucia located the wreckage. The site of the
discovery was not disclosed. BEA said on March 27 that it was
searching for the remains of the aircraft off the Brazil coast.  Air France 447 crashed en route from  Rio de Janeiro  to
Paris in 2009, killing all 228 people on board.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
