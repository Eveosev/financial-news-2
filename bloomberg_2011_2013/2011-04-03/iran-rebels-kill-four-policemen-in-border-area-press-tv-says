Rebels attacked a police station in
 Iran â€™s western province of Kordestan, killing at least four
policemen and wounding five others,  Press TV  reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Militants opened fire on a police station in a village near
the city of Marivan on April 1, the state-run news channel said.  The attackers may be tied to PJAK, the Party for a Free
Life in Kurdistan, the report said. PJAK is affiliated with the
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.  Marivan is near the Iraqi border and the area has been the
scene of frequent clashes between Iranian security forces and
Kurdish fighters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
