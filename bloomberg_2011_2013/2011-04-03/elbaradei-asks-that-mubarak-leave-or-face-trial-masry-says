Former President  Hosni Mubarak 
should leave  Egypt  or be prosecuted, opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei said, echoing protesters’ demands for Mubarak to face
trial.  “Egypt will remain sick as long as Mubarak’s situation
continues to be ambiguous,” ElBaradei, who has said he plans to
run for presidential elections to be held by the end of
November, told Al Masry Al Youm newspaper in an interview. “If
we want to give an impression that we’re changing the regime,
then we have to start with the head.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
