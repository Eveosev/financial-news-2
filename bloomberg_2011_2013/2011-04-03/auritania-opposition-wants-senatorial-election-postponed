Mauritanian opposition parties asked
the government to postpone elections for members of the upper
house of parliament planned for April 24.  The polls should only take place once “an agreement between
the political parties to assure the transparency and the
regularity of the ballot” is secured, the Coordination of the
Democratic Opposition said in an e-mailed statement today from
Nouakchott, the capital.  The group includes the Progressive Popular Alliance, led by
Messoud Ould Boulkheir who is also president of the lower house
of parliament, and the Gathering of the Democratic Forces led by
Ahmed Ould Daddah.  To contact the reporter on this story:
