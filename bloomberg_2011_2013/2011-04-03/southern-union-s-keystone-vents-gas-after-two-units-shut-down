Southern Union Co. (SUG) ’s Keystone gas
plant in Kermit,  Texas , leaked a variety of substances,
including natural gas and hydrogen sulfide, for about eight
hours today, according to a filing with the  Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality .  The emission came after the plant’s Unit 20 had an
unexpected shutdown and Unit 23 “went down due to a loss of
the power to the panel,” the filing said. Other materials
released from the plant included carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide
and nitrous oxide, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
