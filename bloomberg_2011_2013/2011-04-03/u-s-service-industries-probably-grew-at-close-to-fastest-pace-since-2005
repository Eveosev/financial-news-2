Service industries  probably expanded
in March at close to the fastest pace since 2005, a sign the
U.S. economic expansion is broadening beyond manufacturing,
economists said ahead of a report this week.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing businesses was little changed at 59.5 after a 59.7
reading the previous month that was the highest since August
2005, according to the median of 53 forecasts in a Bloomberg
News survey ahead of the April 5 data. Another report may show
first-time filings for  unemployment benefits  fell last week.  Faster job growth may help sustain household spending
against a backdrop of higher food and fuel bills that have
damped  consumer confidence . Federal Reserve officials said last
month the economy is on “firmer footing,” diminishing the need
to extend a bond purchase program beyond June.  “The service sector still looks very strong,” said  David Semmens , a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in  New
York . He said the economic recovery “is more sustainable”
because “you are seeing a better pickup with regard to it being
driven by the consumer.”  A reading above 50 signals growth for the Tempe, Arizona-
based ISM’s measure. The supply managers group reported on April
1 that its manufacturing index expanded last month at close to
the fastest pace in almost seven years.  The factory gauge was little changed at 61.2 after a
February reading of 61.4 as production rose to the highest level
since January 2004. The strength in the industry is generating
greater demand for services, which account for almost 90 percent
of the economy, benefiting companies such as  FedEx Corp. (FDX)   FedEx Benefits  Memphis-based FedEx, which operates the world’s biggest
cargo airline, said March 17 that its per-share earnings for the
fiscal fourth quarter ending May 31 will be $1.66 to $1.83 a
share.  “Our businesses are performing strongly in the  United
States , where industrial production growth is expected to
approach nearly 5 percent in 2011, outpacing GDP and supporting
overall transportation volumes,” Fred Smith, chief executive
officer of FedEx, said in a teleconference.  The  U.S. economy  added more jobs than forecast in March and
the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly declined to a two-year low of
8.8 percent, an indication that the labor-market recovery is
strengthening, Labor Department figures showed April 1.  Payrolls increased by 216,000 workers last month after a
194,000 gain the prior month. Economists projected a March gain
of 190,000, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. Service providers added 185,000 workers last month, the
most since May 2010.  Higher Stocks  Stocks rose last week, adding to gains from the market’s
biggest first-quarter rally since 1998, after the jobs report.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.5 percent on April 1 to
1,332.41 at the 4 p.m. close. Both the  S&P 500  and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  closed at their highest levels since Feb. 18.  Fewer firings are another product of the expanding economy.
The number of Americans applying for  unemployment insurance  fell
by 3,000 to 385,000 last week, the lowest level since the end of
February, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg before the April 7 Labor Department
report.  Employment gains may help Americans dealing with higher
food and gasoline prices. The average cost of a gallon of
regular-grade fuel reached $3.62 on March 31, the highest since
September 2008, according to AAA.  The central bank, after its latest policy meeting March 15,
pledged to continue its program of purchasing $600 billion of
bonds before the second half of the year, in order to “promote
a stronger pace of economic recovery.” Fed officials also said
the economy was on “firmer footing” and acknowledged a rise in
commodity prices, signaling deflation risk had diminished and
they were unlikely to expand the bond purchase plan.  The Fed will release minutes of the March meeting on April
5.
