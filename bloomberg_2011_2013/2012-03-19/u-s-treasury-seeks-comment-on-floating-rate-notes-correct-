The  U.S. Treasury  requested public
comment on the potential issuance of floating rate notes.  The Treasury published a notice today in the Federal
Register for input on data or rationale, alternate approaches
and general terms and conditions for the sale of floating rate
notes.  “Treasury continually seeks ways to minimize borrowing
costs, better manage its liability profile, enhance market
liquidity, and expand the investor base in  Treasury
securities ,” Treasury said in the Federal Register notice.
Treasury said “examining alternative forms and structures of
debt issuance is consistent with Treasury’s mission” to finance
the government at the lowest cost.  Treasury has discussed the possibility of issuing a
floating rate note with the Treasury Borrowing Advisory
Committee, known as TBAC. Today’s notice is meant to solicit a
broader range of input from market participants.  In the Federal Register notice, Treasury asks seven
questions, including on whether floating rate notes would
attract new investors to the Treasury market and suggestions for
the ideal structure and final maturity of the securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
