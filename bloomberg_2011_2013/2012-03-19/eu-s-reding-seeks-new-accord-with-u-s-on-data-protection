Viviane Reding, the European
Union’s justice policy chief, said that the EU and the U.S. need
a data-protection agreement to “provide a high level of privacy
protection” and “facilitate the exchange of data that our
police need to fight crime and terrorism.”  “This continues to be a missing piece of the puzzle,”
Reding told a data protection conference according to a copy of
her prepared remarks. The U.S. and the EU released a joint
statement on data privacy to coincide with the event.  To contact the reporters on this story:
