The  Federal Reserve  plans to
enforce remedial action at mortgage servicing companies
previously found to be negligent, according to a senior
associate director in the Fed’s division of consumer and
community affairs.  “The Federal Reserve will continue to monitor, on an
ongoing basis, the corrective measures that are being taken by
the servicers and bank holding companies it supervises,” said
Suzanne Killian, the senior associate director, who testified
before a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in
 Brooklyn ,  New York .  Killian’s remarks summarized previously disclosed
enforcement actions and monetary fines against some of the
largest mortgage servicers in the U.S. for “misconduct and
negligence related to deficient practices in residential
mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing.”  The Fed said in February that it would fine five banking
organizations a total of $766.5 million as part of a broader
settlement over foreclosure actions. The five holding companies
are  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) , Ally Financial Inc.,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)   Killian said the Fed will “take appropriate supervisory
action including a possible cease and desist order or monetary
penalties to address any inadequacies or violations of the
enforcement actions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
