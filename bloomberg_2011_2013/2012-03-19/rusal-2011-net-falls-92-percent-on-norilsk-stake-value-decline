United Co. Rusal (486) , the aluminum
producer that replaced its chairman last week, said profit fell
92 percent last year after the value of its stake in OAO GMK
 Norilsk Nickel  declined.  Net income was $237 million in the year ending Dec. 31,
compared with $2.87 billion in 2010, the Moscow-based world’s
biggest producer of aluminum said today in a statement. That
compared with the median estimate of $1.78 billion from 16
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  “The reduction in the carrying value of the company’s
investment in Norilsk Nickel, which is attributable to the sales
and purchases by Norilsk Nickel of its own shares during the
year, was a primary reason for the decrease in the net profit,”
Rusal said.  Rusal elected Barry Cheung as chairman on March 16 to
replace billionaire shareholder Victor Vekselberg, who quit amid
a conflict with Chief Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska  over
Rusal’s stake in Norilsk. Vekselberg wanted Deripaska to approve
the sale of the 25 percent stake for as much as $18 billion to
pay down Rusal’s debt and reward shareholders. Deripaska has
said the stake represents a long-term investment.  Rusal shares have fallen about 48 percent since the initial
share sale in  Hong Kong  in 2010, and closed down 0.5 percent at
HK$5.65 on March 16, the lowest level in almost two months,
cutting its value to HK$85.8 billion ($11.1 billion).  To contact the reporters on this story:
