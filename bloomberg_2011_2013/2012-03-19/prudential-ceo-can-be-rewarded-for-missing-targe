Prudential Financial Inc. (PRU)  Chief
Executive Officer John Strangfeld, who told investors to expect
return on equity of at least 13 percent next year, can miss that
goal and still qualify for his performance share awards.  Prudential set an ROE target of 12 percent, on average, for
the three years through 2014 as the only measure of achievement
for Strangfeld and other executives, the  Newark , New Jersey-
based life insurer said March 16 in a filing. Prudential’s ROE
was 11 percent to 11.5 percent in 2011, Strangfeld said Feb. 15.  Strangfeld, 58, told investors last year he was focusing on
boosting ROE, a measure of how well the company reinvests
shareholder money, to 13 percent to 14 percent in 2013. That
target, which Strangfeld has reiterated at least twice this
year, is “a stretch objective,” said  Bob DeFillippo , a
spokesman for Prudential.  “If they want to give a stretch goal to investors, they
should be thinking about maybe the same stretch goal for
executives,” said Wayne Guay, a professor of accounting at the
 University of Pennsylvania ’s Wharton School of Business.  Prudential, the second-biggest U.S. life insurer, gained
less than 1 percent to $64.11 yesterday in New York and has
surged  28 percent  this year.  Prudential targeted 2012 ROE of 10.9 percent to 11.9
percent, meaning Strangfeld would qualify for 100 percent of his
performance share awards by achieving the low end of the ranges
this year and next, and turning in less than 13 percent in 2014.  ‘It’s Just Cushion’  “It’s just cushion for the executives,” Dan Theriault, an
analyst at Portales Partners LLC, said of the performance-award
targets. “Because they are very publicly out there that they
have to achieve this objective” of 13 percent to 14 percent
ROE, he said. Theriault  rates  Prudential “sector perform.”  Strangfeld is eligible for 150 percent of the target awards
if he achieves a 13 percent average over the three years,
DeFillippo said. Prudential will give him 75 percent of the
awards for an 11 percent ROE average and 50 percent of the
target for a 10 percent return, DeFillippo said.  “This is consistent with our 13 to 14 percent objective,”
DeFillippo said. “It also takes into account where our peer
companies are right now.”  MetLife Inc., the biggest U.S. life insurer,  said  in
December it expected 2011 operating return on equity of 10.6
percent to 10.8 percent. Hartford Financial Services Group Inc.,
the property-casualty and life insurer, said in December it
expected a 2012 core earnings ROE of about 8 percent.  Strangfeld is boosting returns by buying back stock and
integrating the Japanese businesses he bought last year from
American International Group Inc. Prudential’s 2011  results 
“enhance our confidence” in the achievement of the 2013 ROE
target, Strangfeld said on a Feb. 9 conference call with
investors.  Strangfeld’s total compensation rose 7.9 percent to $23.7
million for 2011, the company said. The performance share awards
were also offered to other named executive officers, a group
that includes Chief Financial Officer Richard Carbone, Vice
Chairman Mark Grier and Executive Vice Presidents Edward Baird
and Charles Lowrey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
