 An International Monetary Fund
official said  China  will avoid an economic hard-landing as
government data showed property prices falling in most of the
nation’s biggest cities,  “China’s heading for a soft-landing,” Zhu Min, a deputy
managing director at the IMF, said at a conference in  Hong Kong 
today, citing strength in investment. Prices of new apartments
fell in 45 of 70 cities in February, the statistics bureau said
in Beijing yesterday.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  has prolonged a crackdown on real-estate
speculation to reduce the risk of asset-price bubbles and make
housing affordable, saying last week that prices remain far from
“reasonable.” A government program to build millions of low-
cost homes may help to support growth in the world’s second-
biggest economy and moderating inflation means policy makers
have more room to add stimulus.  Zhu said that inflationary pressures are a long-term
challenge for the nation, while investment remains too large as
a proportion of gross domestic product.  The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5 percent as of 11:09
a.m. local time in the first trading since the property numbers
were released.  Adrian Mowat , JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s chief Asian and
emerging-market strategist, said March 14 that China is already
experiencing “a hard landing,” visible through weakness in car
sales and cement and steel production.  To contact the reporter on this story:
