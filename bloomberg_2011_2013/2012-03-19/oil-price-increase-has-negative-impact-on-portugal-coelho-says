Rising  oil prices  have a greater
impact on countries facing difficulties like Portugal, Prime
Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said in Lisbon today.  An increase in oil prices “penalizes countries with
greater difficulties and Portugal is a country that is having
more difficulties,” he said in comments broadcast by SIC
Noticias television station.  “Crude prices have risen for several months in a
systematic way,” said Passos Coelho, adding that it was
important for Portugal to bet on alternative sources of energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
