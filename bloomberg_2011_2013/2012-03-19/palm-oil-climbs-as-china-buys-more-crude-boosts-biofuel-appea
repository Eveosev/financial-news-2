Palm oil  advanced on signs of
increasing demand from China, the world’s biggest cooking oil
user, and as gains in crude oil increased the appeal of
vegetable oils as biofuels.  June-delivery palm oil climbed as much as 0.4 percent to
3,412 ringgit ($1,117) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, and ended the morning session at 3,404 ringgit in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures reached 3,422 ringgit on March 16, the
highest level for a most-active contract since June 6.  China’s palm oil  imports  from Malaysia rose 16 percent to
152,500 tons in the first 15 days of March from the same period
in February, Societe Generale de Surveillance said March 15.
Malaysia’s total exports jumped 42 percent to 701,536 tons in
the same period, it said.  “Signs of demand from  China  are coming in, demand is
slowly strengthening,” said Rajesh Modi, a trader at Singapore-
based Sprint Exim Pte. “Stock levels have depleted and they
have to start buying again.”  Futures also gained alongside advances in other commodities
including oil and soybeans, Modi said.  Oil advanced for a second day as investors bet that a U.S.
economic recovery and Saudi Arabian crude output near the
strongest level since at least 1980 signals fuel demand is
increasing. Oil for April delivery increased as much as 42 cents
to $107.48 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange .  Soybeans for May delivery were little changed at $13.7425 a
bushel at 12:04 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. It earlier
reached $13.78, the highest price for a most-active contract
since Sept. 15.  Soybean oil  for the same month was little
changed at 55.46 cents a pound.  Palm oil for delivery in September rose 0.7 percent to
8,680 yuan ($1,374) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month gained 0.7 percent to
9,706 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
