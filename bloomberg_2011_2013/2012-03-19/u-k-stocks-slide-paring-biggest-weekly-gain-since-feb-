Most  U.K. stocks  fell, dragging the
FTSE 100 Index from an eight-month high, as Chinese house-price
data added to concern that growth is slowing in the world’s
second-largest economy.  CRH (CRH)  Plc, the second-biggest building-materials maker,
retreated 2.1 percent in  London .  Premier Foods Plc (PFD)  sank 4.2
percent after the owner of the Hovis bread and Bisto gravy
brands reported an annual loss.  Misys Plc (MSY)  rallied 7.4 percent as
Vista Equity Partners agreed to buy the company for 1.3 billion
pounds ($2.1 billion).  The FTSE 100 fell 4.47, or 0.1 percent, to 5,961.11 at the
close in London as three shares declined for every two that
gained. The gauge advanced 1.3 percent last week after reports
showed that the U.S. economic recovery is strengthening and the
euro area’s finance ministers approved a second bailout for
 Greece , rising to the highest level since July. The FTSE-All
Share Index lost 0.1 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
slipped 0.9 percent.  “We’re still warning investors to be generally cautious in
their global portfolios,” said  Andrew Milligan , the chief
global strategist at Standard Life Investments Ltd. He spoke in
a Bloomberg Television interview with Maryam Nemazee.  The number of shares that changed hands on the  FTSE 100 (UKX) 
today was 13 percent below its 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge is trading within 0.7 percent
of the 6,000 level.  China House Prices  New home prices fell in 27 of 70 Chinese cities last month
from a year earlier, the highest proportion since the government
began at the start of 2011 releasing individual data for 70
cities instead of a national average.  CRH slid 2.1 percent to 1,379 pence in London trading.
 Croda International Plc (CRDA) , whose shares were added to the FTSE 100
today, retreated 3 percent to 2,171 pence.  Premier Foods sank 4.2 percent to 11.5 pence as it reported
a full-year loss of 339 million pounds.  “It is hard not to come to the conclusion that these are
truly awful results,” Clive Black, an analyst for Shore Capital
Group Ltd. in Liverpool wrote today.  Cadogan Petroleum Plc (CAD) , a London-listed oil and gas explorer
in Ukraine, tumbled 7.8 percent to 25.25 pence as Eni SpA
decided not to invest further in a project in the eastern
European country.  Misys Gains  Misys jumped 7.4 percent to 354 pence. Vista Equity
Partners agreed to acquire Misys a week after Temenos Group AG
ended talks over an all-share merger with the British financial-
software maker. Vista, a San Francisco-based private-equity
firm, will pay 350 pence a share, the companies said. Misys’s
independent directors agreed to recommend the deal to
shareholders.  Gem Diamonds Ltd. (GEMD)  surged 12 percent to 281 pence as
analysts estimated that the supplier to Tiffany & Co. will
report that profit more than doubled last year, and after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said demand from  China  may boost the
stock. The mining company is due to report results to investors
tomorrow.  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR) , an Indian power producer and oil refiner,
surged 14 percent to 141.8 pence, the biggest gain since it
first listed in London in May 2010. The shares were added to
Bank of America Corp.’s “Europe 1” list of recommended
companies.  Essar has still retreated 17 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
