French rapeseed in the country’s
southeast needs irrigation following more than three dry months,
which depleted soil-water reserves, according to Cetiom,
 France ’s technical center for oilseed crops.  Rapeseed in the area is in the stem elongation stage and a
lack of water at this point could have “serious consequences”
on yields, the Paris-based center wrote in a report on its
website today.  No rain is forecast for the Languedoc-Roussillon and
Provence-Alpes-Cote d’Azur regions, the center wrote.  The dryness means rapeseed plants, which are in their phase
of “maximum vegetative development,” are suffering from a lack
of nitrogen because they need water to absorb the nutrient,
according to Cetiom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
