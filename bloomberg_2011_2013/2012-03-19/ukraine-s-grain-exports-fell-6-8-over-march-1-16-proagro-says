Ukrainian grain exports from ports
fell 6.8 percent in the first 16 days of March from the same
period a month earlier, researcher ProAgro said, without giving
a reason.  Ukraine shipped 881,670 metric tons of grains, including
636,250 tons of corn, 131,530 tons of wheat and 96,630 tons of
barley in the first 16 days of the month, the Kiev-based
agricultural researcher said in an e-mailed statement today.
That compares with 946,420 tons of grains from Feb. 1 till Feb.
16, according to the statement.  South Korea  bought 115,400 tons of corn and  Egypt  purchased
103,500 tons, making them the largest buyers of Ukrainian corn,
according to the ProAgro.  Another 1.2 million tons of grains, including 870,200 tons
of corn, 217,000 tons of wheat and 134,000 tons of barley will
be exported from Ukrainian ports “in the nearest time,”
ProAgro said.  Ukraine has exported 3.9 million tons of wheat via ports
this marketing year that started July 1, ProAgro said. Wheat
deliveries are forecast to be 5.5 million tons in the whole
marketing year, it said. Exports of barley will probably total
2.5 million tons and shipments of corn will be 13 million tons
this marketing year, according to the researcher’s forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
