OAO Gazprom could be liable for as
much as 650 billion rubles ($22 billion) a year in extra taxes
on its earnings from higher domestic tariffs,  Alfa Bank  said.  The government may tax 80 percent to 100 percent of
Gazprom’s profits from domestic tariff increases, which may
result in a windfall of 140 billion to 650 billion rubles
annually in the next five years, Alfa Bank analysts Pavel Sorokin and Maria Yegikyan wrote in a note today.  “Discussion is worrying, with a high chance of further tax
increases exceeding the scheduled pace,” Alfa Bank said. “The
proposed measure can indeed become a cash-flow killer.”  Russia is increasing domestic gas rates to reach parity
between local sales and exports. Gazprom, the world’s biggest
gas producer, has said the increase is needed for it to avoid
losses on gas sales at home, where demand is rising.  A ruling could come within the next fortnight as the
government discusses what percentage of profit will be taxed,
the bank said. It isn’t clear if the proposal will use
“additional revenue or actual profit received from
indexation,” Alfa Bank said.  The government may decide on the size of the tax within the
next two weeks, Deputy Finance Minister  Sergei Shatalov  said in
comments posted on the ministry’s website on March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
