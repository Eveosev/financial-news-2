Corp. Geo SAB,  Mexico ’s second-
largest homebuilder, plans to sell 10-year dollar bonds as soon
as tomorrow, according to a person familiar with the
transaction.  Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Banco Santander SA (SAN) 
are arranging the sale of the bonds, which are callable after
five years, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because he’s not allowed to speak publicly.  The proceeds will be used to pay down existing debt, the
person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
