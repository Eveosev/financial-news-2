Wesley Clark, the retired U.S. Army
general who ran for president in 2004, joined the board of
SoloPower Inc., which is seeking to increase production.  Clark’s expertise in government and in international
markets will help the company reach potential new customers in
U.S.,  Japan ,  South Korea  and Italy, San Jose, California-based
SoloPower said today in a statement.  SoloPower operates a plant in San Jose and is building
another in  Portland , Oregon, which will eventually have annual
production capacity of about 400 megawatts. The company’s thin-
film solar  panels  are produced on flexible rolls of steel and
weigh less than standard, polysilicon-based photovoltaic
products, Clark said in an interview.  “I think the idea of going after rooftops with lightweight
solar panels is a winning strategy,” Clark said. “The U.S. has
hundreds of miles of big-box rooftops not designed to hold the
weight of massive, glass-based solar panels.”  Clark is a member of the Clinton Global Initiative’s energy
and climate-change advisory board and served as supreme allied
commander  Europe  for NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.  SoloPower’s investors include Hudson Clean Energy Partners,
Crosslink Capital Inc. and Convexa AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
