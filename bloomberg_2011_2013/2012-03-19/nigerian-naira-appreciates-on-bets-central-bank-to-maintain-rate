The naira advanced to its highest
level in more than a week after a fall in the inflation rate
spurred bets the central bank may cut  interest rates  from their
record high at its meeting tomorrow.  The currency of sub-Saharan  Africa ’s second-biggest economy
appreciated as much as 0.2 percent to 157.6 per dollar, its
strongest level since March 9. It traded less than 0.1 percent
higher on the  interbank market  as of 3:15 p.m. in Lagos,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria’s  inflation  rate declined to 11.9 percent in
February from 12.6 percent a month earlier, the National Bureau
of Statistics said in an e-mailed statement today. The country’s
central bank left  benchmark interest rate  unchanged at a record
high of 12 percent for a second consecutive time on Jan. 31 to
curb prices after the government partially removed fuel
subsidies, boosting gasoline costs.  “Had it not been for fuel subsidy reforms, inflation may
have been decelerated to 9-10 percent,”  Razia Khan , the London-
based head of Africa research at Standard Chartered Plc, wrote
in an e-mailed note today. “Recent foreign exchange
appreciation might provide a positive influence,” making room
for adjustments to the monetary tightening, she said.  The naira has advanced 2.9 percent since the beginning of
this year, the fourth-best performance among African currencies.  Dollar Auction  The central bank sold $200 million at a foreign-currency
auction today, with lenders buying the entire amount on offer,
the Abuja-based bank said in an e-mailed statement. The marginal
rate, also used as the prevailing exchange rate, remained
unchanged at 156.06 naira from the previous sale on March 14, it
said.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s $500 million of dollar bonds due
2021 gained one basis point, or 0.1 percentage point, to 5.599
percent. Borrowing costs of domestic bonds due 2015 rose three
basis points to 15.88 percent, according to prices on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association  website .  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated to record low, down 0.8 percent to
1.7603 per dollar in Accra, the weakest since at least June
1993.  To contact the reporter on this story:
