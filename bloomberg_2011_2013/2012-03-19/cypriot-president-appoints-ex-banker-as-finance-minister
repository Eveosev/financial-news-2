Cyprus’s President Demetris Christofias, reshuffling his Cabinet, appointed former banker
Vassos Shiarly as finance minister to succeed Kikis Kazamias,
who resigned on health grounds.  Interior Minister Neoklis Sylikiotis will replace Praxoula Antoniadou at the ministry of commerce, industry and tourism,
which is also in charge for energy affairs, government spokesman
 Stefanos Stefanou  told reporters in Nicosia today. Eleni Mavrou,
former mayor of Nicosia, the eastern Mediterranean island’s
capital, will take over as interior minister.  Shiarly, born in 1948, was former chief general manager at
Bank of Cyprus, the nation’s largest lender, before becoming
group adviser and chairman of the Cypriot  Health Insurance
Organization .  Shiarly will officially begin on March 23, while the other
two ministers assume their new duties tomorrow, Stefanou said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
