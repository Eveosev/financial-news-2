Standard & Poorâ€™s  said it may lower
almost all of the ratings it has assigned to U.S. collateralized
debt obligations backed by structured-finance securities after a
change in its methodology for grading the debt.  The bonds under review had $63 billion of balances at
issuance, New York-based S&P said today in a statement.  These types of CDOs, which package assets such as mortgage
bonds into securities with varying risks, helped spark the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression as some slices with
AAA grades lost all of their value within a year.  The ratings review covers 517 bonds from 224 CDOs, with 361
carrying rankings below investment grade, or lower than BBB-,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
