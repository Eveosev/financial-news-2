Daily price changes in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index are decreasing the most in eight decades,
shrinking to the smallest since 1995 when investors abandoned
stocks just before the biggest rally ever.  The  benchmark gauge  for U.S. equities has gained or lost an
average 0.46 percent a day this year, compared with 1.04 percent
 in 2011 , the biggest reduction since 1934, during the Great
Depression, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Swings are
diminishing after  valuations  fell 40 percent and correlation
among shares weakened the most in at least three decades.  At the same time, trading on the  New York  Stock Exchange
has slumped to  the lowest rate  in 13 years, spurring concern
about the biggest first-quarter rally since 1998. Bulls say the
decline in trading and daily swings signal fear is dissipating
after one of the most volatile years on record. Bears say
falling volume is a warning gains will reverse should economic
reports and earnings fail to match expectations.  “Low volatility is good in that it will bring investors
back,” Tim Hoyle, the director of research at Radnor,
Pennsylvania-based Haverford Trust Co., which manages $6
billion, said in a March 13 phone interview. “Even though
bullish sentiment is high, people are still fearful. I see it in
my business every day, they couldn’t stomach the volatility.
This will restore some sense.”  Breaching 1,400  Equities rallied last week, with the  S&P 500 (SPX)  gaining 2.4
percent to 1,404.17, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU) 
reaching the highest level since 2007 even as trading slid to a
2012 low on March 12. Gains were fueled by the biggest  retail
sales  increase in five months and an improved economic
assessment by the  Federal Reserve . The S&P 500 advanced 0.4
percent to 1,409.75 today.  The index has gained 28 percent since reaching a one-year
low in October amid signs the Fed’s zero-interest rate policy is
spurring growth and a ninth straight quarter of earnings growth.
The rally curbed recession concerns that sent the index down
almost 20 percent between April and October last year. Companies
from  Clorox Co. (CLX)  to  Goodrich Corp. (GR)  are advancing even as the size
of daily  moves (VIX)  decreases.  Efforts by European leaders to contain their debt crisis
are sparing investors last year’s trauma. The S&P 500 has
declined more than 1 percent once this year, when it fell 1.5
percent on March 6. That’s the fewest times to start a year
since 1995 and compares with an average of 12 such drops in each
quarter of 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Moves have
decreased the most 78 years, when they shrunk to 1.23 percent
from 2.23 percent.  Falling Valuations  The S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio has dropped to 14.6 from
24.2 in December 2009, mirroring its retreat to 16 from 26.5 in
the 32 months ended in January 1995. Stocks soared that year,
with the index gaining 34 percent for an annual return unmatched
in the last half century.  The potential for surprise now is similar to 1995, when the
 yield  on 30-year U.S. Treasuries fell 1.93 percentage points
even as  Wall Street  predicted it would rise, according to a
March 1 note from Laszlo Birinyi, president of Westport,
Connecticut-based Birinyi Associates.  “We are not insisting on a repeat but believe that
investors should consider the possibility,” wrote Birinyi,
among the first to advise buying stocks in March 2009, just as
the S&P 500 began a rally that doubled the index’s market value.
“In 1995 the consensus trade was higher yields, today it is
tepid economic growth and the market is suggesting, perhaps
insisting, an alternative to that consensus.”  Weakening Link  The degree to which stocks move in tandem has diminished,
giving investors more opportunity to make money based on
 earnings  and corporate actions, according to ING Investment
Management’s Paul Zemsky. The so-called correlation coefficient
for  S&P 500 members  fell 44 percent to 0.43 on March 5, the
biggest retreat for any two-month period since at least 1980,
according to the 50-day rolling average of Birinyi data. A
coefficient of 1 means all 500 stocks move together.  “The downtrends in all those indicators reflect the other
side of the panic that drove forced liquidations last summer,”
Kevin Caron, a market strategist in Florham Park,  New Jersey , at
Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which has more than $119 billion in
client assets, wrote in a March 14 e-mail. “As cooler heads now
prevail, markets are again more discriminate and rational which
means hedging activity subsides, forced sales abate, and good
stock picking becomes a critical skill.”  Short Interest  Speculators closing bearish trades by buying back stock
they borrowed and sold may be adding to gains.  New York Stock
Exchange short interest  as a percentage of total shares
outstanding has fallen every month since September, to 3.29
percent in February, the lowest level since March 2011. Before
that, short interest was last this low in October 2007, the data
show.  Some investors view  rising short interest  as bullish. It
reached a two-year high on the NYSE in September, just before
the  S&P 500  began a five-month rally that restored more than $3
trillion to equity values. Its peak before that came in March
2009, when the index began an advance in which it has risen 108
percent.  Becalmed markets are doing little to lure investors. An
average of 768.44 million shares a day  changed hands  on the NYSE
in the 50 days through March 5, the least since 1999, data show.
Volume on all  U.S. exchanges  fell to 5.23 billion on March 12,
the lowest daily level of 2012 and the smallest total excluding
holiday weeks since Bloomberg data began in 2008.  Staying Away  Trading by individuals has been slowing since the 2008
financial crisis. Daily average volume slipped 9 percent last
quarter compared with a year ago, according to data from New
York-based  E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC) , TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.,
in Omaha,  Nebraska , and Charles Schwab Corp., based in  San
Francisco . At E*Trade, the fourth-largest retail brokerage by
client assets, daily trading volume is 35 percent below its
level at the end of 2008. Revenue-generating trades are down 14
percent in the same period at Schwab.  “For the markets to move higher, we’re going to need to
have money come into the market,” Chris Sheldon, who helps
oversee $400 billion as chief investment officer at Dreyfus
Corp. in New York, said in a Bloomberg Television interview
March 14. “Right now the volumes are quite low, and that tells
me that there’s still some skepticism.”  Bearish Strategists  Wall Street strategists are more bearish now than they’ve
been at this point in any year since at least 2006, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The S&P 500 will end 2012 at 1,357,
3.4 percent below last week’s closing price, according to the
average of the 11 firms surveyed by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 has
outpaced strategists three other times since data started in
2006.  Although the economy avoided a recession last year,
forecasts for first-quarter expansion at 2 percent are less than
the 3 percent growth in the last three months of 2011, the
Institute for Supply Management’s index of U.S. factory activity
is below the high reached in 2011 and analysts revised 2012
 earnings  projections down 0.9 percent since the start of the
year. The data signal the economy isn’t growing fast enough to
justify the gain in stocks during the past five months,
according to Scott Migliori at RCM in San Francisco.  ‘Too Fast’  “The market has gone too far, too fast relative to the
economic data,” Migliori, the chief investment officer for the
U.S. at RCM, which has about $128 billion under management, said
in a March 14 phone interview. “I’m in the camp that the market
probably starts to struggle.”  Sentiment among individual investors is a reason to buy
stocks now, said Stewart Capital Advisors’  Malcolm Polley . Net
outflows of funds that invest in U.S. equities totaled $2.13
billion in January, after $135 billion in 2011, the worst year
since 2008, according to the Investment Company Institute in
 Washington . The data show investors have money to spend once
they regain confidence, he said.  “Individual investors are always the last ones to the
party,” Polley, who oversees $1.1 billion as chief investment
officer at Stewart Capital in  Indiana ,  Pennsylvania , said in a
March 13 phone interview. “The average person on the street
doesn’t want to own stocks, they’re tired of making no money for
a decade. That blows my mind. For me, I like that because it
means things are relatively inexpensive.”  Clorox, Ecolab  Clorox, in Oakland,  California , has a  price-earnings ratio 
about 25 percent below its average since 1990. The stock rose
1.9 percent this year, even with daily gains or losses of 0.55
percent, down from 1.03 percent last year. The advance in the
past 2 1/2 months is already almost half last year’s 5.2 percent
advance.  Ecolab Inc. (ECL) , the largest maker of cleaning chemicals for
hotels and restaurants,  jumped  4.2 percent this year, on track
for the best first quarter since 2006. Volatility in the stock
is about half what it was last year, with daily moves of 0.52
percent, compared to 1.2 percent in 2011.  Goodrich has risen or fallen an average 0.1 percent so far
in 2012, the lowest of any S&P 500 company. That’s down from
1.14 percent in 2011, more than the S&P 500’s average. The
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based  aerospace equipment maker  is up
1.8 percent in 2012, compared with a loss of 4.7 percent at the
same point last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “When volatility and correlation go down like this it’s a
sign that people are generally more content with their positions
and are more sanguine about the market,” Zemsky, the New York-
based head of  asset allocation  for ING, said in a March 15
telephone interview. His firm oversees $160 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
