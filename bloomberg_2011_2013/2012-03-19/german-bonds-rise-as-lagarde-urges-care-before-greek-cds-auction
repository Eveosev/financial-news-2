German 30-year bonds rose, with
yields falling from near a four-month high, as International
Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde  urged policy
makers to be vigilant of threats to global economic stability.  Ten-year bunds were little changed as credit-default swaps
dealers held an auction to settle Greek bond insurance claims.
Portuguese bonds advanced even after Mohamed El-Erian, chief
executive officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., said the
nation is likely to become a second Greece. The European
Financial Stability Facility sold 1.5 billion euros ($1.99
billion) of 20-year securities.  “Bunds are higher after the IMF comments,” said  Michael Leister , a fixed-income strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt .
“It reminds investors that there are still a lot of worries,
most of all regarding Greece. The bailout we just had most
likely isn’t the last one.”  The German 30-year yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.68 percent at 4:34 p.m.  London  time. The
3.25 percent bond due July 2042 rose 0.630, or 6.30 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 111.705. The yield climbed to 2.73
percent on March 16, the highest level since Dec. 8.  The 10-year yield was little changed at 2.05 percent, after
dropping to as low as 2 percent.  The German 10-year yield fell one basis point to 2.04
percent at 4:12 p.m. London time, after dropping as much as five
basis points to 2 percent. The 2 percent bond due January 2022
rose 0.08, or 80 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to
99.630. The yield climbed to 2.07 percent on March 16, the
highest level since Dec. 12.  Greece  remains “accident prone” and may require further
debt restructuring or additional financing from euro countries
if it struggles to implement measures attached to a new 130
billion-euro bailout, the IMF said in a report.  No Comfort  “Optimism should not give us a sense of comfort or lull us
into a false sense of security,” Lagarde said yesterday at a
speech at the China Development Forum in Beijing. “We cannot go
back to business as usual.”  German  10-year yields  may drop toward 1.9 percent after
failing to sustain a break above 2.05 percent, Leister said,
citing trading patterns.  “The 2 percent to 2.10 percent area for 10-year bund
yields is key,” he said. “It seems that the range is going to
hold for now. There’s scope in the short-term for a move towards
1.9 percent.”  Stocks are poised to outperform bonds, according to UBS.  “The secular  bear market  in bonds has begun,” UBS said in
a report dated March 16. “The source of the sell-off is clear -
- an improved and more durable global economic recovery,
particularly in the U.S.,” UBS analysts including chief
economist Larry Hatheway in London wrote in a note to clients.  Portuguese Bonds  Portuguese bonds rallied even after Pimco’s El-Erian said
the nation is likely to require another bailout.  “Unhappily, this will be the case,” El-Erian said in an
interview with  Germany ’s  Der Spiegel . The first rescue package
for Portugal will prove insufficient and the country will ask
the euro region for more money, he was cited by the magazine as
saying. “Then the financial markets will get nervous.”  Portugal ’s  10-year yield  declined 14 basis points to 13.52
percent, down from a euro-era record 18.29 percent set Jan. 31.  Pimco, which manages the world’s biggest bond fund, is
avoiding the debt of Greece, Ireland and Portugal and is also
“cautious” on the bonds of Spain,  Italy ,  France ,  Andrew Balls ,
London-based head of European  portfolio management , said in an
interview published on the Pimco’s website.  The company also sees a “significant risk” Greece will
leave the 17-nation euro-region, Balls said in the interview.  ‘Significant Risk’  “Greece’s exit from the Eurozone remains a significant
risk and one that could lead to contagion,” he said.  Sellers of credit-default swaps on Greece will have to pay
as much as $2.5 billion to settle contracts triggered by the
nation’s debt restructuring.  The settlement was determined after dealers agreed a final
value for Greek bonds of 21.5 percent of face value at an
auction, according to administrators Markit Group Ltd. and
Creditex Group Inc.  The yield on Greece’s 2 percent bond maturing in February
2042 rose nine basis points to 15.09 percent.  Italian bonds rose even as a report showed industrial
orders fell in January for the first time since October. Orders
dropped 7.4 percent after rising a revised 5.2 percent the
previous month, the government said.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield declined three basis points to
4.83 percent.  French Sale  The EFSF sold bonds due in March 2032 priced to yield 115
basis points over swaps, giving an implied yield of 3.956
percent, according to a press release.  France sold 4.007 billion euros of 91-day bills at an
average yield of 0.047 percent. Investors bid for 2.92 times the
amount of debt allotted. That compares with a so-called bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.47 at the previous auction of similar-maturity
securities on March 12, which were sold at a yield of 0.067
percent.  France also sold securities due in 168- and 350 days.
Greece and  Spain  will sell bills tomorrow.  German bunds handed investors a loss of 1.3 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds rose 13 percent, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
