Chile ’s peso fell as renewed
concern that European growth is stalling eclipsed gains in the
country’s main export, copper.  The currency declined 0.1 percent to 483.28 per  U.S. dollar 
at the 1:30 p.m. close in Santiago from 482.55 on March 16.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slipped 0.1 percent before a
report forecast to show a contraction in euro-area industrial
output, the  International Monetary Fund  said Greece may need
another bailout and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde
urged policy makers to be vigilant about threats to economic
stability. Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports,
rose 0.5 percent in New York after inventories tracked by the
London Metal Exchange contracted for an 18th session.  “The peso is likely to move in line with global stocks
today because there isn’t much around in the way of news,” said
Matias  Madrid , an economist at Banco Penta in Santiago. “The
Chilean GDP figure doesn’t give much to trade on because there
was a change of base.”  Chile’s gross domestic product grew 4.5 percent in the
fourth quarter from the same period a year earlier, bringing
growth for the full year to 6 percent, the central bank said
today. The median estimate of 11 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for GDP to expand 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
