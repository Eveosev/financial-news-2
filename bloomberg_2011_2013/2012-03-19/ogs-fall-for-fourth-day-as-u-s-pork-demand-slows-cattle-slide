Hog futures fell for a fourth
straight session, the longest slump this year, on signs that
rising U.S. pork supplies are outpacing demand. Cattle prices
also dropped.  Wholesale  pork  dropped to 82.7 cents a pound on March 16,
the lowest since Jan. 12, 2011, and down from a record $1.1019
in August, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Hog
processors slaughtered 414,000 hogs today, up 1.7 percent from a
year earlier, USDA data show. In the week ended March 10,
average hog weights rose 0.7 percent from a year earlier, the
government said.  “Pork demand is soft,” Chad Henderson, a market analyst
for Prime Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,
 Wisconsin , said in a telephone interview. “The rising hog
weights are only adding to the excess supply.”  Hog futures for June settlement retreated 0.2 percent to
close at 93.40 cents a pound at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange. The last time prices fell four straight
sessions was Dec. 16. The most-active contract earlier touched
93.15 cents, the lowest for the June futures since Dec. 19.  Cattle futures for June delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$1.2215 a pound in Chicago, capping a four-day drop of 2.1
percent. On March 16, the price touched $1.2165, the lowest
since Jan. 10.  Wholesale-choice beef dropped on March 16 to $1.8991 a
pound, the lowest in a month, according to the USDA. Retail beef
fell to $4.612 a pound in February, from a record $4.64 in
January, the USDA said March 16.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement slid 0.7 percent
to $1.54775 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
