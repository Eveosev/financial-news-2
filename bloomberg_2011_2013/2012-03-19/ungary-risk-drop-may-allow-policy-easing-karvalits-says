A drop in  Hungary ’s risk premium
would allow for policy easing, central bank Vice President
Ferenc Karvalits said.  The country’s foreign-currency denominated debt ratio of 65
percent leaves little room to maneuver and monetary easing may
create risks to financial stability, Karvalits said in a March
17 speech. Presentation slides from the speech were e-mailed by
the Budapest-based central bank today.  The government needs to take additional measures to address
slowing growth and should focus on making public debt
sustainable, Karvalits said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
