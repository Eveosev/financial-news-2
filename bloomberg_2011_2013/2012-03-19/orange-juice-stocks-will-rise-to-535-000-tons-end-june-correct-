(Corrects to say stockpiles will rise in headline)  Global orange-juice inventories
held by the world’s three biggest producers will rise to 535,000
metric tons on June 30 from 214,000 a year earlier, following
the end of harvesting last month, the Brazilian orange-juice
association said.  Sucocitrico Cutrale Ltda., Louis Dreyfus & Cie SA and the
company formed by the merger between Citrovita and Citrosuco
held 932,000 tons of juice in stockpiles on Dec. 31, the 
association said. It didn’t disclose the volume held at the 
end of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
