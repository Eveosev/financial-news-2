Drydocks World LLC, which owns the
Middle East’s biggest shipyard in Dubai, expects to win
contracts worth $350 million after a debt reorganization
agreement with lenders is completed, its chairman said.  “We have presently a number of letters of intent,” Khamis
Juma Buamim said in an interview in Dubai today. Clients have
told the company that, once the debt reorganization is complete,
the letters can be activated and they are mainly for “quite
lucrative” projects, he said. “We are looking at an additional
potential of $300 million to $350 million.”  Drydocks has proposed repaying creditors over five years as
part of a plan it submitted March 8. It’s one of several Dubai
companies seeking to reorganize debt after property prices and
asset values slumped and credit markets froze at the onset of
the 2008 credit crisis.  The company borrowed $2.2 billion in 2008 to finance two
acquisitions in Singapore to gain ships and Asian shipbuilding
sites. $1.7 billion was for three years at 170 basis points, or
1.7 percentage points, over the London interbank offered rate,
and another $500 million was for five years at 190 basis points
over Libor, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company
says it expects to complete restructuring in July.  So far this year, Drydocks has won $300 million of
contracts in Dubai for building and converting ships and is
making “$30 million to $35 million a month” from its repair
side, Buamim said. Areas on which it’s focusing include the Gulf
of Mexico, the North Sea, the Arabian Gulf for its oil and gas
industry and the Far East because of potential growth in
exploration for hydrocarbons, he added.  Drydocks made a profit of $125 million before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization in 2011 and Buamim said he
“will not accept less than that” this year. The company cut
costs by as much as 25 percent last year and wants a further
reduction of as much as 15 percent in 2012, he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
