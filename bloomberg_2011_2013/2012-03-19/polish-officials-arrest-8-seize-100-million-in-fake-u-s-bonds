Poland  has seized $100 million
worth of fake U.S. treasury bonds and arrested eight people in
connection with the raid, the government’s corruption-fighting
agency said.  The suspects, three Poles, two Ukrainians, two Italians and
a Moldovan, will be questioned today by the public prosecutor’s
office in the southeastern city of Lublin, the agency’s
spokesman, Jacek Dobrzynski, said by phone.  The raid, the biggest such seizure ever in Poland, took
place yesterday afternoon in two southern provinces of the
country, Dobrzynski said, declining to give further details.  Italian anti-mafia prosecutors last month seized a record
$6 trillion of allegedly fake U.S. bonds, almost half of the
U.S.’s public debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
