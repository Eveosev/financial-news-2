712.31, at 4:37 p.m. in  New York . Cotton and cocoa lead the
gain.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 prices rose for the

increasing for supplies from the U.S., the world’s biggest
exporter. Sugar and cocoa also rose.  U.S. net sales of upland cotton more than doubled in the
week ended March 8 from a week earlier, led by purchases from
China, the top user, the government said. While  India  ended a
ban on authorized exports on March 12, the government said it
won’t permit registrations for new shipments until further
notice, Commerce Secretary  Rahul Khullar  said.  Cotton for May delivery advanced 1.8 percent to settle at
89.08 cents a pound at 2:30 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, the biggest increase for a most-active contract since
March 5. The price has tumbled 55 percent in the past 12 months.  Sugar futures climbed to a three-week high on speculation
that output will trail forecasts in Brazil, the world’s top
producer. Coffee and cocoa advanced.  Copersucar SA, Brazil’s biggest sugar-trading and

tons in the season that starts in April, down from a forecast of
as much as 34 million tons in February, after drought damaged
crops.  Raw sugar for May delivery advanced 1 percent to close at

ton in New York. Arabica-coffee futures for May delivery
increased 0.6 percent to $1.835 a pound on ICE.  In  London  futures trading, refined sugar and cocoa gained
on NYSE Liffe, and robusta coffee slid.  BASE METALS  Copper rose to the highest closing price in two weeks as
signs of economic gains bolstered prospects for metal demand in
the U.S., the world’s second-biggest consumer.  Government and industry reports this week may show U.S.
home purchases climbed in February to the highest in almost two
years, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
Separate data from the Commerce Department may signal
homebuilding increased. The Copper Development Association says
that construction accounts for 40 percent of demand.  Copper futures for May delivery advanced 0.8 percent to

refinery closures because of low margins and seasonal
maintenance will reduce supply as peak driving season
approaches.  Futures advanced as Valero Energy Corp. said today that it
will idle its Aruba refinery because it’s losing money. The
235,000-barrel-a-day plant supplies feedstocks to U.S. Gulf

a drop in the dollar boosted the appeal of the metal as an
alternative asset.  The dollar fell as much as 0.5 percent against a basket of
six currencies, reaching the lowest level since March 9. Gold
prices have climbed 6.4 percent this year as the dollar slumped
on record low U.S. borrowing costs and as  Europe ’s leaders

growth will accelerate, bolstering fuel demand in the world’s
biggest crude-consuming country.  Futures gained 1 percent as confidence among U.S.
homebuilders held in March at the highest level since June 2007
and sales expectations climbed. Bank of America Corp. raised
2012 price forecasts, projecting an economic recovery as
geopolitical events constrain supplies. West  Texas  Intermediate

much as 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) of rain in the next 24
hours from a storm that began yesterday in west Texas, World

outpacing demand. Cattle prices also dropped.  Wholesale pork dropped to 82.7 cents a pound on March 16,
the lowest since Jan. 12, 2011, and down from a record $1.1019
