House Republicans  will call for
cutting the top U.S. income-tax rate to 25 percent from the
current 35 percent as part of their budget proposal for 2013.  The plan by House Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan  of
 Wisconsin  would consolidate the number of individual income tax
brackets to two, from the current six, with the lower rate set
at 10 percent.  It would reduce the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent,
from 35 percent, while eliminating the alternative-minimum tax
intended to make sure that individuals pay at least some tax,
according to documents provided by Ryan’s office.  Ryan has said he will seek cuts to federal programs such as
Medicare to help reduce the government’s budget deficit. His
budget plan last year sought to privatize the Medicare health-
care plan for the elderly.  Maryland Representative  Chris Van Hollen , the top Democrat
on the House Budget Committee, said he was “very surprised” that
Republicans would revive last year’s tax proposal because “both
the politics and the math hurt them.”  “The reality is you’re talking about a tax cut of several
hundred thousand dollars for a millionaire and a tax increase on
middle-income taxpayers,” he said in an interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
