OAO Transneft (TRNFP) ,  Russia ’s oil
pipeline operator, began building a 488-kilometer (303-mile)
link from untapped  oil deposits  in Arctic Siberia to the main
pipeline grid, allowing the crude to flow to Asia or  Europe .  “We welded the first kilometer this morning Moscow time,”
Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for the state-controlled company, said
by telephone today.  The $3.83 billion-pipeline from the Purpe transit hub to
Zapolyarye, which means beyond the polar circle, will be able to
carry 45 million tons of crude a year, produced by TNK-BP, OAO
Gazprom Neft, OAO Lukoil and OAO Novatek. This is almost 9
percent of Russia’s world leading output of 511 million tons
last year, or 10.3 million barrels a day.  Transneft aims to complete the first stage of the pipeline
by the end of 2014, the second stage by the end of 2015, and the
third stage in the fourth quarter of 2016, Dyomin said.  The link will probably cost 112 billion rubles ($3.83
billion), Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said in October
at the opening of the Purpe-Samotlor pipeline, which connects
the region to the East Siberia Pacific Ocean link. Transneft
will finance 30 percent of the cost from its own cash and use
existing credit lines for the remainder, Transneft President
Nikolai Tokarev said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
