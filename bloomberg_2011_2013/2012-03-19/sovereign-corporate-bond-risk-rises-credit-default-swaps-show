The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt fell to the lowest in more
than eight months, reversing an earlier increase, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 12 basis
points to 516.5, the lowest since Aug. 4, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co. at 11:30 a.m. in London. A decline signals
improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 2.25 basis points to 116.25 basis
points, the lowest since July 28.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers decreased three basis points to 188 and
the subordinated index dropped five to 324, JPMorgan prices
show.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 14 governments rose 0.5 basis point to 225.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
