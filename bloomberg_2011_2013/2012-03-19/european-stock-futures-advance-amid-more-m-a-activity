European (SXXP)  stocks were little changed
after last week’s biggest advance for the benchmark Stoxx  Europe 
600 Index since early February.  Standard Life Plc and  DSV (DSV)  A/S paced declining shares after
analysts downgraded the companies.  Misys Plc (MSY)  rallied 7.4 percent
after Vista Equity Partners agreed to buy the company for 1.3
billion pounds ($2.1 billion). Greek banks climbed as corporate
bond risk fell in Europe.  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  slid 0.1 percent to 272.07 at the close in
London, following last week’s 2.6 percent advance. The gauge
rose to its highest level since July last week as data from
 Germany  to the U.S. indicated global growth is gaining momentum
and the  Federal Reserve  raised its assessment of the world’s
largest economy.  The market is “getting very high, possibly running out of
oxygen as it were. Some of the tactical indicators are beginning
to look quite weak,” Michael O’Sullivan, head of portfolio
strategy at Credit Suisse Private Banking said on Bloomberg
Television. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see some sort of
correction over the next couple of weeks.”  The Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  has rallied 11 percent this year as the
region’s central bank disbursed 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion)
of loans to euro-area banks and U.S. economic reports topped
economists’ forecasts. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index and the
 MSCI Asia Pacific (MXAP)  Index have both jumped 12 percent.  National benchmark indexes fell in eight of Europe’s 18
western markets. France’s CAC 40 Index lost 0.5 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index and Germany’s DAX Index slipped 0.1
percent each. The volume of shares changing hands on the Euro
Stoxx 50 Index today was 22 percent less than the average over
the past 30 days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Implied Volatility Low  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures the cost of Euro Stoxx 50
options, slumped 19 percent last week, to its lowest level since
April 29. It slipped 0.9 percent to 18.36 today.  Standard Life (SL/)  fell 1.2 percent to 247.7 pence, snapping a
five-day rally. Credit Suisse Group AG downgraded Scotland’s
biggest insurer to underperform from neutral, equivalent to a
sell recommendation.  DSV (DSV)  retreated 2 percent to 131.30 kroner after UBS AG
lowered its rating for the transport and logistic company to
neutral from buy.  Julius Baer Group Ltd. fell 2.1 percent to 36.75 Swiss
francs after saying Raymond J. Baer will step down from the
board to lead efforts to resolve matters relating to a tax-
evasion probe by the U.S.  While he will become honorary
chairman on April 11, it will be the first time in the company’s
history that there hasn’t been a member of the Baer family on
the board.  Misys, TNT Express  Misys paced advancing shares, jumping 7.4 percent to 354
pence in  London  after Vista reached an agreement to buy the
British financial  software company  for 350 pence a share, a week
after Temenos Group AG ended talks over an all-share merger with
Misys.  TNT Express NV also advanced 1.1 percent to 9.44 euros
after United Parcel Service Inc. sweetened its bid to 5.16
billion euros.  PostNL NV increased 1 percent to 4.71 euros after the
company agreed to sell its 29.8 percent stake in TNT following
UPS’s takeover bid.  National Bank of Greece SA (ETE) , the country’s biggest lender,
rallied 6.2 percent to 2.57 euros as the cost of insuring
against default on  European (SXXP)  corporate debt fell to the lowest in
more than eight months.  EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA (EUROB) , the second
largest, climbed 8.8 percent to 92.5 euro cents.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 25 basis
points to 503.5 at 4.54 p.m. A decline signals improvement in
perceptions of credit quality.  Credit-default swaps dealers held an auction today to
settle as much as $3.2 billion of Greek bond insurance triggered
by the nation’s debt restructuring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
