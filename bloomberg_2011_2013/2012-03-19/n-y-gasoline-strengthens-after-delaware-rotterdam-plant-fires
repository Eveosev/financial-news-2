New York  gasoline strengthened as
 PBF Energy Inc. (PBF)  assessed damage from a blaze at the  Delaware 
City refinery in Delaware and BP Plc reported a “small fire”
in a unit at a Rotterdam plant.  The fires may mean lower production on the East Coast and
reduced gasoline exports from  Europe .  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor narrowed 2.5 cents to 19
cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 1:48 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt delivery rose 3.14 cents to $3.1733 a gallon.  BP shut down crude feed to a furnace at the Netherlands
refinery after a “small amount” of oil leaked overnight, Ruud
Natrop, a spokesman for the Rotterdam-Rijnmond fire department,
said by telephone.  The fire at the 182,000-barrel-a-day Delaware City plant,
which broke out at about 4:55 p.m. local time March 16 in a
desulfurization unit, was put out at about 5 p.m., Nick Purse, a
firefighter for the Delaware City Fire Company, said in a
telephone interview.  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  reported emissions from sources at the
Big Spring refinery in Texas, including a fluid catalytic
cracker, after a boiler shut, according to a filing with state
regulators.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast versus futures narrowed 0.48 cent to 16.4 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
