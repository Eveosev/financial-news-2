India ’s rupee fell on speculation
importers stepped up dollar purchases to meet payments ahead of
the March 31 financial year-end.  The currency reversed an earlier gain on concern higher  oil
prices  will boost India’s import costs, according to  Corporation
Bank . Brent oil has risen 11.7 percent this year to $125.31 a
barrel. The rupee rose earlier on speculation gold imports will
slow after the government increased tariffs on the metal,
helping rein in the nation’s current-account deficit.  “We saw sustained demand for dollars from importers,”
said Sudarshan Bhatt, chief currency trader at state-run
Corporation Bank in Mumbai. “Oil prices are also a concern.”  The rupee declined 0.1 percent to 50.2344 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, after rising as
much as 0.2 percent. The currency dropped 0.7 percent last week.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, fell 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 9.50 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Finance Minister  Pranab Mukherjee , presenting the annual
budget in parliament on March 16, doubled the customs duty on
gold bars and coins to 4 percent and the excise duty on refined
gold to 3 percent. India, the world’s biggest bullion buyer,
aims to narrow the shortfall in its  current account  from an
estimated 3.6 percent of gross domestic product in the year
through March 31, according to Mukherjee.  Three-month onshore forward contracts traded at 51.32 a
dollar, compared with 51.33 on March 16, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 51.34 from 51.36. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
