Lithuanian Interior Minister
Raimundas Palaitis will resign “in the near future” to help
maintain stability among the three-party coalition that rules
the Baltic nation.  Palaitis decided to step down after meeting President Dalia Grybauskaite and Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius, he told a news
conference today at the president’s office in the capital,
Vilnius.  Kubilius asked Palaitis to resign after he fired officials
from the financial-crime investigation service. He initially
refused and was backed by Grybauskaite. Tensions between
Kubilius’s Homeland Union and the Liberal Center Union
intensified last week, culminating when the partners said
yesterday that they couldn’t work together any longer.  Grybauskaite told the same news conference the coalition
“can and must work together.” The next general election is
scheduled for October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
