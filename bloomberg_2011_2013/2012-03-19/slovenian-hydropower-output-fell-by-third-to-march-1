Slovenian electricity production
from hydropower plants fell by a third in the first two months
because of the drought, STA newswire  reported , citing Holding
Slovenske Elektrarne d.o.o., the countryâ€™s biggest power
producer and wholesaler.  Drought caused an 8 percent drop in electricity generation
last year and forced HSE to import electricity from neighboring
countries like  Italy , Austria and  Hungary , the Slovenian
newswire said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
