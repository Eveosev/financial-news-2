A judge’s rejection of a
$285 million settlement between  Citigroup Inc. (C)  and the
Securities and Exchange Commission won’t be reviewed by a
federal appeals court until September.  In November, U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff denied approval
of the settlement, which was intended to resolve SEC claims that
Citigroup, the third biggest U.S. bank, misled investors in
$1 billion in securities linked to risky mortgages. In the
ruling, Rakoff criticized the SEC’s practice of agreeing to
settlements that don’t require the defendants to admit
wrongdoing.  Citigroup and the SEC both appealed Rakoff’s ruling. The
appeals court last week assigned lawyer John R. Wing to argue
the judge’s position before the appeals court.  In an order today, the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in  New York 
scheduled oral argument in the case for some time in the last
two weeks of September. Last week the court blocked Rakoff from
holding a trial in the case while it considers the appeal.  The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., 11-05227, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (New York).  To contact the reporters on this story:
