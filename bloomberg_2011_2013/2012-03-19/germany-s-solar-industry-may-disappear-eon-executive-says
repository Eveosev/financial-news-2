Germany ’s solar manufacturing
industry will disappear within five years because of competition
from Chinese companies, said Klaus-Dieter Maubach, a member of
the management board at EON AG.  A surge in production of solar cells from Chinese companies
is driving down the price of panels and making German companies
uncompetitive, Maubach said today at the Bloomberg New Energy
Finance Summit in  New York .  “In five years, not a single employee will be working at
the German solar companies,” he said. “They will all be
bankrupt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
