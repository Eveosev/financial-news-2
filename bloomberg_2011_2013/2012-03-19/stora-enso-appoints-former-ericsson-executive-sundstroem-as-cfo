Stora Enso Oyj (STERV) , Europe’s largest
papermaker, appointed Karl-Henrik Sundstroem, finance head at
 NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) , to take over as chief financial officer.  “Karl-Henrik Sundstroem has proved to be a world-class
CFO,” Stora Enso Chief Executive Officer Jouko Karvinen said in
a statement today.  Sundstroem will take his new role at the Helsinki-based
company on Aug. 1. He was previously CFO of  Ericsson AB (ERICB) , the
largest maker of wireless networking equipment, and stepped down
after the company surprised investors in October 2007 with
third-quarter results that missed forecasts.  Stora Enso, which has assets in Latin America, may benefit
from Sundstroem’s background in the region and in Australian
operations at Ericsson. Sundstroem also headed Ericsson’s
services business.  Stora Enso added Per Lyrvall, general counsel, and Lauri Peltola, head of global identity, to its group executive team,
according to today’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
