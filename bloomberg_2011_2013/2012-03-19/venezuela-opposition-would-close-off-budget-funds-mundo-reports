Venezuela ’s opposition would close
off-budget funds that are spent at the discretion of President
Hugo Chavez if it wins October’s election,  El Mundo  said, citing
the chief economic adviser to presidential candidate Henrique
Capriles Radonski.  A Capriles government would ask the National Assembly to
audit the funds before incorporating them into the national
budget, said Ricardo Villasmil, according to the Caracas-based
newspaper.  Fonden, an off-budget fund created in 2005, has received
more than $80 billion from the government, according to Finance
Minister Jorge Giordani.  To contact the reporter on this story:
