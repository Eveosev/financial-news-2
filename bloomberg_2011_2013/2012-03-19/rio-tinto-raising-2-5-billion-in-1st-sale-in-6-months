Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) , the world’s third-
largest mining company, tapped the U.S. market to raise $2.5
billion of debt in its first bond sale in six months.  The company sold bonds in a four-part offering of three-,
five-, 10- and 30-year securities, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The London-based miner sold $1 billion of the 10-year
notes to yield 120 basis points, or 1.2 percentage points, more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show.  Rio Tinto last issued debt in September, selling $1.15
billion of 3.75 percent senior unsecured notes due in 10 years,
and $500 million of 2.25 percent securities maturing in 2016,
Bloomberg data show. Yields on investment-grade debt in the U.S.
have fallen to 3.55 percent from 3.75 percent the last time the
company sold bonds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG
and JPMorgan Chase & Co. managed the sale.  The three-, five- and 30-year offerings, each $500 million
in size, priced at a spread of 62.5 basis points, 85 basis
points and 137.5 basis points more than Treasuries, the data
show.  Rio Tinto  is  rated  A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, four
levels above investment grade, and an equivalent A- by  Standard
& Poor’s .  To contact the reporter on this story:
