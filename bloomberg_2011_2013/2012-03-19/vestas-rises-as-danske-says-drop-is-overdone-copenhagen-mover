Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the
biggest maker of  wind turbines , climbed to a  six-week high  in
Copenhagen after Danske Bank A/S recommended buying the shares,
saying investor concerns about demand and the impact of a mooted
rights offer are “overdone.”  Vestas, based in Aarhus,  Denmark , gained as much as 3.8
percent to 66.35 kroner, the highest since Feb. 7, and traded at
65.50 kroner as of 1:56 p.m. local time, making it the biggest
gainer on the benchmark  OMX Copenhagen 20 Index (KFX)  today.  “The industry outlook is still mixed but not deteriorating
to the extent the share price discounts,” Danske Markets, a
unit of Danske Bank, said in a note to clients. Investor
concerns about a possible rights issue are also “overdone,”
the brokerage said.  Shares (VWS)  in Vestas have fallen 91 percent from a  record  in
September 2008 as turbine prices dropped on excess capacity and
competition from Chinese manufacturers including Sinovel Wind
Group Co. and Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co.  Turbine contracts signed in the second half of 2011 for
delivery in 2013 fell 4 percent to 910,000 euros ($1.2 million)
a megawatt compared with the previous six months, the lowest
since at least 2008, according to a Bloomberg New Energy Finance
report on March 6.  Danske Markets, which had previously had a “bearish view”
on Vestas because of concerns about regulation, excess supply
and falling prices, resumed coverage of the stock today with a
buy recommendation and an 80 kroner ($14.16) target price.  Vestas has won an order for 25 V90, 2-megawatt turbines
from  China ’s Longyan, it said earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
