Singapore’s  Straits Times Index (FSSTI) 
dropped 0.7 percent to 2,990.09 at the close, erasing gains of
as much as 0.6 percent. Two shares fell for each that rose in
the 30-member gauge.  The following were among the most active shares in the
market. Stock symbols are in parentheses after company names.  CapitaMall Trust (CT)  , a shopping-mall operator, gained
1.7 percent to S$1.775. RHB Capital Bhd initiated coverage of
the stock with an “outperform” rating and share-price forecast
of S$2.18. The company will benefit from rising consumption
growth and tourist arrivals in the city-state, it said.  Interra Resources Ltd. (ITRR)   rose 3 percent to 34
Singapore cents after the energy explorer said it completed
drilling an oil production well in Myanmar.  Otto Marine Ltd. (OTML)   climbed 5.3 percent to 14
Singapore cents after the shipbuilder said it won a contract,
valued at $14.9 million to charter a vessel to a Mexican
company.  STATS ChipPAC Ltd. (STAT)  , a provider of chip-testing
and packaging services, dropped 0.9 percent to 53 Singapore
cents. The company said first-quarter net revenue may fall
between 9 percent and 11 percent compared to the previous
quarter due to weaker-than-expected demand. It previously
forecast a “mid single digit decrease” in net revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
