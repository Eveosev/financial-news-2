The  Portuguese government  may start
a tender to sell state-controlled shipyard Estaleiros Navais de
Viana do Castelo SA within 45 days, an official at the Defense
Ministry said today.  A final decision may take place two months after the offers
are received, the official, who declined to be named in line
with his ministry’s policy, said by phone today.  The government has received three written expressions of
interest and three requests for information about the
shipbuilder, the official said, adding that the  Finance Ministry 
will decide on the final terms of the sale.  Portugal is selling assets to comply with the terms of a
78-billion euro ($103 billion) bailout from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund . The government also plans
to sell state-owned  airline TAP SGPS SA  after divesting most of
its holdings in utility  EDP-Energias de Portugal SA  and in
power-grid operator  REN-Redes Energeticas Nacionais SA. (RENE)   Portugal plans to find a shareholder for the shipyard that
will guarantee the company’s future, Prime Minister  Pedro Passos
Coelho  said today. The shipbuilder, based in the town of Viana
do Castelo on the country’s northwest coast, builds and repairs
medium-sized ships and has about 670 employees.  The company is “not sustainable” at the moment, he said
in comments to reporters in Lisbon, broadcast by SIC Noticias
television station.  “We hope the privatization will take place as soon as
possible,” said Passos Coelho.  To contact the reporter on this story:
