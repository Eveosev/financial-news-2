Resilux NV (RES) , the Belgian plastic-
bottle-mold maker, said full-year 2011 profit fell 35 percent
because of swings in raw-material prices, higher bad-debt
provisions and wider startup losses at its AiroLux AG venture.  Net income  dropped to 7.99 million euros ($10.6 million),
or 4.03 euros a share, from 12.2 million euros, or 6.18 euros, a
year earlier, the Wetteren, Belgium-based company said today in
an e-mailed statement. Revenue increased 23 percent to 286.5
million euros, exceeding a 9.6 percent gain in sales volumes.  Resilux faced slowing demand in  Europe  in the second half
because of poor summer weather. As the price for the raw
material polyethylene terephthalate declined, the company was
forced to sell its swollen inventory of molds made previously
from higher-priced PET at reduced prices. Writedowns on customer
receivables increased by 1.8 million euros.  Resilux’s share of losses at  AiroLux , a Bilten,
Switzerland-based maker of plastic dispensers that compete with
metal cans for aerosols, widened to 1.12 million euros from
519,000 euros in 2010.  Resilux forecast 2012 earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization will be “in line” with last
year’s 28.3 million euros, which met the average of three
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company
maintained its  dividend  at 1.65 euros a share after net debt
jumped 46 percent to 44.4 million euros last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
