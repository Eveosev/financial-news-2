Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) 
Chairman Lowell McAdam expects the data transportation market,
including feeding information between wireless devices, to grow
to $25 billion in the coming years from “basically zero” now.  Linking information from automobiles, thermostats and
mobile phones will expand the need for collecting and using
information they generate, the executive said at the Bloomberg
New Energy Finance confernce today.  “Energy management is operating without a central nervous
system,” McAdam said in New York. “Our technology is providing
that central nervous system so that you can have that 700
percent growth in data traffic.”  Verizon is the second-biggest U.S. phone service provider
and along with  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  owns the nation’s biggest
wireless mobile-phone provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
