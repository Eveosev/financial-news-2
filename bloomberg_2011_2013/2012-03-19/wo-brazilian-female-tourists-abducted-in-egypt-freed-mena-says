Two Brazilian female tourists and
their tour guide have been released hours after being kidnapped
in  Egypt â€™s Sinai, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported.  The three were kidnapped by gunmen who stopped a tourist
bus traveling from the St. Catherine area in South Sinai to
Cairo, Mena said. They were released after the intervention of
tribal leaders in the area, the Cairo-based agency reported late
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
