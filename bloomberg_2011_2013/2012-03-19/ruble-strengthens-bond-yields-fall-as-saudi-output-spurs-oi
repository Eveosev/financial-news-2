The ruble strengthened against the
dollar for a fifth day and the yield on  Russia ’s dollar-
denominated bonds fell amid speculation exporters are converting
revenues into the Russian currency to pay taxes.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 29.2045 per
dollar at the close in Moscow, the strongest level since Feb.
29. The yield on the country’s $3.5 billion of debt due 2020
dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.91
percent.  “The tax period is providing us with good dollar supply,”
Dmitry Sinitsyn, head of foreign exchange in Moscow at Credit
Suisse Group AG, said by e-mail. “Risk-on sentiment is helping
the ruble -- the market feels safe being long on it, with stocks
and oil trending upwards.”  Companies convert revenues from abroad into rubles to pay
taxes in the second half of every month, boosting the Russian
currency. Exporters may sell between $3 billion to $4 billion
against the ruble this week, Sinitsyn said.  Oil, Russia’s chief export earner, jumped 0.8 percent to
$107.91 per barrel in  New York  after data submitted to the Joint
Organization Data Initiative showed  Saudi Arabia  pumped 9.87
million barrels a day in January, a sign of higher demand.  Urals
crude (EUCRURNW) , the main Russian blend of the commodity, lost 0.6 percent
to $122.30 per barrel, within $2.96 of a 3 1/2-year high.  Increasing Bets  The ruble gained less than 0.1 percent to 38.555 per euro
and 0.2 percent to 33.4122 against the central bank’s target
dollar-euro basket. Investors pared bets on the currency
weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at
29.5838 per dollar in three months, compared with expectations
of 29.605 per dollar on March 16.  Russia’s Eurobonds due 2015 rose for the first time in four
days, pushing the yield down four basis points to 2.284 percent.
Dollar-denominated debt maturing in 2015 issued by OAO Sberbank,
Russia’s largest lender, yielded 14 basis points less than on
March 16 at 3.475 percent, while the yield on notes due the same
year from state gas monopoly OAO Gazprom fell five basis points
to 3.312 percent.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps dropped two basis points
to 164 basis points, down from last year’s peak of 338 on Oct.
4, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
