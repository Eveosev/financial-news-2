Norwayâ€™s $600 billion wealth fund
is interested in the sale of state-owned assets in  Portugal ,
Diario Economico reported, citing an interview with  Yngve Slyngstad , chief executive officer of Norges Bank Investment
Management.  A decision to take part depends on the price of the assets,
Yngve told the Portuguese newspaper. The fund is cutting its
holdings of euro-area bonds and investing in stocks in the
region, he was cited as saying.  The wealth fund invested 1.7 billion euros ($2.24 billion)
in Portugal in 2011 compared with 2.1 billion euros the previous
year, Diario Economico reported. Portugal is selling stakes in
several companies to comply with the terms of a 78-billion euro
bailout requested last year from the European Union and the
 International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
