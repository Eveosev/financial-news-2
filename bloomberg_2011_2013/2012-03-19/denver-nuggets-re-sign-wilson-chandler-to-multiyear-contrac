The  Denver Nuggets  re-signed
forward  Wilson Chandler , who averaged 15.3 points and 5.7
rebounds with the Nuggets and  New York Knicks  last season.  Chandler played in the Chinese Basketball Association
during the National Basketball Association lockout and was
ineligible to return to the NBA until being cleared by his team
and the International Basketball Federation.  “It is great to have Wilson back on our roster,” Nuggets
executive vice president of basketball operations Masai Ujiri
said in a statement, which didn’t disclose financial terms of
Chandler’s multiyear deal. “It was a very unique situation
signing a talented free agent in the middle of the season.”  Chandler, who originally joined the Nuggets as part of the
Feb. 2011 trade that sent  Carmelo Anthony  to the Knicks, will
get $37 million over five years,  ESPN reported , without saying
where it got the information. Selected 23rd overall by the
Knicks in the 2007 NBA draft, Chandler has averaged 13.9 points
and 5.2 rebounds in 254 career games.  The Nuggets have a 25-20 record this season and are in
second place behind Oklahoma City in the Western Conference’s
Northwest Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
