Apple Inc. (AAPL)  said it sold more than 3
million iPads during the debut weekend for the latest model of
the market-leading tablet computer.  The tally is a record for opening weekend iPad sales,
Cupertino, California-based Apple said in a statement.  AT&T Inc. (T) 
said earlier today that it had also set a single-day record for
iPad sales when it was made available on March 16.  The iPad, first introduced in 2010, is Apple’s second-
biggest source of revenue, behind the iPhone. The new version
features a high-definition screen and a faster processor. Apple
Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has said he thinks purchases of
tablet computers such as the iPad will eventually surpass those
of personal computers.  Apple sold a record 15.4 million iPads in the fiscal first
quarter, which ended Dec. 31. The new device initially went on
sale in the U.S., Australia, Canada, France, Germany,  Japan ,
Puerto Rico, Singapore, Switzerland, the U.K., U.S. Virgin
Islands and  Hong Kong . On March 23, it goes on sale in 24
additional countries.  The iPad sales figure is Apple’s second major announcement
today. The world’s most valuable company said earlier it will
use some of its $97.6 billion in cash and investments to
institute a  dividend  and begin buying back $10 billion worth of
shares.  Apple rose 2.7 percent to a record $601.10 at the close in
 New York . The shares have surged 48 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
