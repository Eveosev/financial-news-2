Foldhitel es Jelzalogbank Nyrt. , a
Hungarian mortgage lender, rose for a third day after posting a
fourth-quarter loss that was lower than Erste Group Bank AG and
Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt estimated.  The shares gained 0.9 percent to 585 forint by 10:24 a.m.
in Budapest. The net loss in the period was 3.4 billion forint
($15.4 million), compared with net income of 8 billion forint a
year earlier, FHB said in a filing to the Budapest Stock
Exchange after the end of trading on March 14. The bourse was
closed for a public holiday for the remaining days of last week.  “Market reaction could be positive due to the smaller-
than-expected loss,” Gabor Kemeny, an analyst at Budapest-based
broker Concorde, wrote in a research report today. Concorde had
predicted a possible loss of 7 billion forint. Erste forecast an
8.8 billion-forint loss.  To contact the reporter on this story:
