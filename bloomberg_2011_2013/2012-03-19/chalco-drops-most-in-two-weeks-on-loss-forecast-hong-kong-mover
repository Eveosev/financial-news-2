Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. , the
nation’s biggest producer of the lightweight metal, fell the
most in almost two weeks in  Hong Kong  after saying it may be
unprofitable in the first quarter following a second-half loss.  The stock dropped 4.2 percent to HK$3.89 at the close in
Hong Kong, the biggest decline since March 6. The benchmark  Hang
Seng Index  fell 1 percent.  Net loss was 174.6 million yuan ($28 million) in the six
months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 247.4 million
yuan a year earlier, according to Bloomberg calculations based
on Chalco’s full-year earnings announced last week. The loss is
wider than the 43.6 million-yuan median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The company said it will give details of
the first-quarter loss in its quarterly report.  China ’s monetary tightening led to higher interest costs
that increased the company’s finance costs last year, the
company known as Chalco said March 16.  Aluminum prices  in London
dropped to a 17-month low in December on concern that the
European sovereign-debt crisis and a slowdown in the  U.S.
economy  may curb demand for commodities.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
