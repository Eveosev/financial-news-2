China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited (CHU) 
fell to the lowest level in almost a year as the nation’s
second-largest wireless carrier reported the smallest increase
in new third-generation network subscribers in four months.  Shares of China Unicom traded in the U.S. declined 3.5
percent to $17.05 at the close in  New York , the lowest price
since March 31, 2011. Volume totaled 1.96 million, or more than
double the average three-month trading activity for the shares.  China Unicom added 2.83 million subscribers to its 3G
network in February, the smallest gain since October, to bring
the total to 45.89 million by the end of the month, the company
said in a statement today to the  Hong Kong  Stock Exchange. China
Unicom had added more than 3 million users in each of the
previous three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
