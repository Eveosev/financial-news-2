Ginkgo Residential Trust Inc., a
real estate investment trust that owns and manages apartments in
the southern U.S., disclosed a plan to raise about $250 million
in an initial public offering.  Ginkgo was formed to continue the business of BNP
Residential Properties Inc., which was sold to the Australian
investment firm Babcock & Brown Residential LLC in 2007, the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said today in a
regulatory filing. The REIT owns 24 apartment complexes in its
home state,  South Carolina  and  Virginia , totaling 5,768 units,
according to the  filing , which doesn’t say how many shares it
will sell or at what price.  The company, led by Chief Executive Officer Philip Payne
and Chief Operating Officer D. Scott Wilkerson, will “pursue an
aggressive acquisition program” to expand its portfolio of mid-
market apartments in the South and has identified about $270
million of potential purchases, according to the filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  “We typically do not face significant competition from
other institutional multifamily real estate buyers for
acquisitions in our target markets, as these buyers tend to
focus on luxury properties in select gateway or coastal markets
outside the southern U.S.,” the company said in its filing.  The $250 million is a placeholder number used to calculate
registration fees and is subject to change. Robert W. Baird &
Co., a Milwaukee-based investment management firm, agreed to
underwrite the offering, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
