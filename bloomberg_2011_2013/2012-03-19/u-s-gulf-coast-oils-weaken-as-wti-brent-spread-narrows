U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums
weakened as the spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent
crudes narrowed.  Brent’s premium over WTI, based on May futures contracts,
decreased $1.08 to $17.15 a barrel. When Brent gains versus WTI,
it strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete
with West African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE)  oil’s premium to WTI narrowed by
$1.50 to $22 a barrel at 4:31 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  increased 90
cents to $22.40 over the U.S. benchmark.  Thunder Horse  lost 85 cents to $19.45 a barrel over WTI and
 Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  decreased 65 cents to a premium of $14.35. Poseidon’s
premium lost $1.10 to $13.30, while Southern Green Canyon’s
premium narrowed 55 cents to $14.70.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount was unchanged at $5.30 a barrel.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount narrowed $1 to $29 below
WTI. Bakken oil strengthened $3 to 14.50 a barrel under WTI, and
Syncrude’s discount widened 50 cents to $10.50 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
