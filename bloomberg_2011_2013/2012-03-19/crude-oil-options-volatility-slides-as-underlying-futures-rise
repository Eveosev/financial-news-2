Crude oil options volatility fell
for a third day as underlying futures advanced while staying
within a three-week trading range.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 24.3 percent as of 4:50 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 24.99 percent in the previous session. The measure has
declined from 30.8 on March 6.  “We’re still coming in slowly every day, coming off on
this narrow range,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of
Paramount Options Inc. in New York. “Crude was higher on the
day and volatility is going to go down.”  Crude for May delivery gained $1.03 to settle at $108.09 on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Since Feb. 21, the front-month
contract has traded in a range of $103.78 to $110.55.  “Volatility today barely moved,” said Vince Lanci,
managing partner of Echobay Partners LLC, a commodity investment
firm in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “The market continues to be
bolstered by Middle East fears, but the driver today was the
pronounced weakness in the dollar.”  The dollar fell 0.5 percent against the euro at 4:08 p.m.
in New York, its third straight loss against the European
benchmark. A weaker dollar increases the investment appeal of
commodities.  Most-Active  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
