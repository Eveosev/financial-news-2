Moe Harkless, the 2011-12 Big East men’s basketball Rookie of
the Year and only freshman selected as an all-conference
honorable mention, said today he plans to enter the National
Basketball Association draft.  Harkless, 18, a New York City native, made the announcement
in front of friends and family members at Madison Square Garden,
the Red Storm said in an e-mailed release. Harkless is trying to
become the first St. John’s player chosen in the NBA draft since
Omar Cook in 2001.  “It has been my lifelong dream to play in the NBA, and I
am excited to have that opportunity to make the jump,” Harkless
said in the release. “I am grateful to my teammates and coaches
at  St. John’s .”  Harkless this season averaged 15.5 points per game, second
on the team behind D’Angelo Harrison, and 8.6 rebounds per game,
tied for most in the conference among first-year players with
Providence College’s LaDontae Henton. He had 11 double-doubles,
six in conference play.  The NBA draft will be held June 28 at the Prudential Center
in  Newark ,  New Jersey . The early entry deadline is April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
