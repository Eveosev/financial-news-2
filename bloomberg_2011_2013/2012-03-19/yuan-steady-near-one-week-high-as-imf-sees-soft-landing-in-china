China ’s yuan was little changed
near a one-week high after the  International Monetary Fund  said
the world’s second-biggest economy will avoid an economic hard-
landing even as property prices fell in some cities.  The currency earlier gained as much as 0.2 percent after
the People’s Bank of China set its daily  reference rate  0.19
percent stronger today at 6.3082 versus the dollar. German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said last week European officials have
discussed combining euro-area bailout funds to reinforce the
region’s financial firewall.  “The euro-zone area is stabilizing temporarily and China’s
economic outlook remains one of a soft-landing scenario,” said
Jackit Wong, an economist in Hong Kong at Natixis Asia Ltd.
“There’s room for gradual yuan appreciation.”  The yuan traded at 6.3233 per dollar at the close in
 Shanghai , compared with 6.3227 on March 16, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.3103 today,
the strongest level since March 9. The currency weakened 0.4
percent in the last three weeks.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose to 0.1
percent to 6.3213 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable
forwards gained for a third day, strengthening 0.06 percent to
6.3235, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined 8 basis
points, or 0.08 percentage point, from a two-month high to 2.42
percent.  China is heading for an economic “soft-landing,” Zhu Min,
a deputy managing director of the IMF, said at a conference in
 Hong Kong  today. The lender forecasts  China’s economy  will
expand 8.8 percent in 2013, after cooling to 8.2 percent this
year from an estimated 9.2 percent in 2011.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
