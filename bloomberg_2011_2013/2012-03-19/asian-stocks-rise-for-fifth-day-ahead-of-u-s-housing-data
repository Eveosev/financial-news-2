Most Asian  stocks  dropped after
International Monetary Fund Managing Director  Christine Lagarde 
warned of the risk of slowing growth in emerging markets and
home prices in  China  posted the worst performance in a year.  Guangzhou R&F Properties Co. (2777) , the biggest developer in the
southern Chinese city, fell 3 percent in Hong Kong. Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd., the country’s largest producer of the
metal, sank 4.2 percent after saying it may be unprofitable in
the first quarter after posting a wider-than-expected loss in
the second half of 2011. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
rose 3.2 percent in Taipei after the world’s largest contract
manufacturer of chips said it may raise  capital spending .  “People are generally happier with the outlook for global
growth at this stage and that’s been reflected in high equity
prices,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion in
equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. “The concern is
probably not so much about the magnitude of growth China can
achieve.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  was little changed at 128.01 as
of 7:49 p.m. in Tokyo, with about five shares falling for every
four that rose.  The gauge climbed 12 percent this year through March 16 as
positive economic reports from the U.S. boosted the outlook for
the region’s exporters. The rally boosted the value of stocks on
the gauge to 15 times  estimated earnings  on average as of March
16, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.4 times for
the Stoxx 600.  Nikkei, Hang Seng  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  advanced 0.1 percent to
its highest close since the earthquake and tsunami on March 11,
2011. The gauge is about 1 percent away from recouping all its
losses since the quake.  The benchmark index plunged about 16 percent in the two
days following the disaster, which left 19,000 people dead or
missing and disrupted supply chains for companies from Toyota
Motor Corp. to Sony Corp. It was the biggest two-day drop since
the week of Black Monday in October 1987.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.3 percent today.
South Korea’s Kospi Index climbed 0.6 percent. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index added 0.2 percent, erasing losses of as much as
0.9 percent. Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 1 percent,
reversing gains of as much as 0.6 percent.  Chinese developers and lenders declined in Hong Kong as new
home prices fell in 27 of 70 cities last month from a year
earlier, the worst since the government began at the start of
2011 releasing individual data for 70 cities instead of a
national average.  ‘Biggest Risk’  Guangzhou R&F slipped 3 percent to HK$9.34.  Soho China
Ltd. (410) , a developer in Shanghai and Beijing, fell 1.8 percent to
HK$5.49.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd. , the world’s
biggest lender by market value, dropped 1.5 percent to HK$5.20.  China’s “property market is still the biggest risk the
economy is facing now and there’s lots of uncertainty to the
sector,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong
Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “Earnings and the
economy have yet to bottom out.”  The world’s second-biggest economy must “continue shifting
the drivers” of growth toward domestic consumption and away
from investment and exports, Lagarde said yesterday. Policy
makers must be vigilant as oil prices, debt levels, and the risk
of slowing growth in emerging markets threaten global economic
stability.  Aluminum Corp. of China sank 4.2 percent to HK$3.89 in  Hong
Kong . The company, also known as Chalco, last week reported a
loss of 174.6 million yuan ($28 million) for the six months
ended Dec. 31., about four times bigger than the median estimate
of analyst surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Rusal Rebounds  Of the 591 companies that have  reported earnings  since Jan
9, 56 percent have missed analysts’ estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s biggest aluminum producer,
climbed 4.4 percent to HK$5.90 in Hong Kong after posting
fourth-quarter earnings that fell less than analysts’ estimates.
The stock slumped 14 percent last week after  Victor Vekselberg 
quit as chairman of the company amid a dispute with Chief
Executive Officer  Oleg Deripaska  over dividends and asset sales.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.2
percent. The  S&P 500 Index  added 0.1 percent, while the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  snapped a seven-day gain on March 16
after an increase in oil and consumer prices sparked inflation
concerns as the  U.S. economy  improves.  TSMC Climbs  Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing increased 3.2 percent to
a record close of NT$83.7 in Taipei after the world’s largest
contract manufacturer of chips said it may raise capital
spending this year amid rising demand.  Exporters increased today ahead of reports this week
expected to show some stabilization in the U.S. property market.
Home purchases in the U.S. probably climbed in February to the
highest level in almost two years, according to economists’
estimates.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , Asia’s No. 1 consumer-electronics
maker, gained 1.8 percent to 1.26 million won in Seoul.  Komatsu
Ltd. (6301) , a maker of construction equipment that gets about 22
percent of sales from the Americas, advanced 2.9 percent to
2,508 yen in Tokyo.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and
clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., rose 1.5 percent to HK$19.38 in
Hong Kong.  To contact the reporters on this story:
