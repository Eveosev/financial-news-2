Shares of the following companies
had  unusual  moves in  China  trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses as of the close.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, rose 5.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to
2,410.18. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  gained 0.3 percent to 2,630.01.  Developers:  China Vanke Co. (000002)  (000002 CH), the nation’s
biggest listed property developer, dropped 0.6 percent to 8.22
yuan. Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048 CH), the second
largest, lost 0.8 percent to 10.73 yuan.  February home prices posted the worst performance in a
year. New home prices fell in 27 of 70 cities last month from a
year earlier and prices were unchanged in six cities, the
national statistics bureau said in a statement on its website
yesterday. That is the worst since the government began at the
start of 2011 releasing individual data for 70 cities instead of
a national average.  Rare-earth stocks:  Inner Mongolia  Baotou Steel Rare-Earth
Hi-Tech Co. (600111 CH), China’s biggest producer of rare earth,
gained 4.3 percent to 71.91 yuan. Rising Nonferrous Metals Share
Co. (600259 CH) surged 8.6 percent to 69.40 yuan.  China may start the trial use of specialized receipts for
rare earths in the provinces of Inner Mongolia and Sichuan in
June, the Information Times reported today, without citing
anyone. The receipts would mean that rare earths have been added
to a list of goods that can only be sold with government
approval, such as tobacco and salt, the newspaper reported.  Shale gas-related stocks:  Kingdream Public Ltd. (000852)  (000852 CH)
surged the maximum 10 percent to 14.92 yuan.  Yantai Jereh
Oilfield Services Group Co. (002353)  (002353 CH) gained 2.9 percent to
84.36 yuan. Zhangjiagang Furui Special Equipment Co. (300228 CH)
rose 4.4 percent to 44.15 yuan.  China will study and release “concrete” fiscal and tax
supportive policies to promote and encourage the development of
shale gas, according to a report by a newspaper owned by the
Ministry of Finance that was posted to the ministry’s website
today. The measures include increasing investment in shale gas
resource appraisal and drafting subsidy policies for shale gas,
it said.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Allen Wan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
