India’s Future Group, including
 Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF) , plans to wipe out its 78 billion-
rupee ($1.6 billion) debt by March 2013, the Economic Times
newspaper reported, citing Chairman  Kishore Biyani .  The group is negotiating as many as 18 deals to raise
funds, and expects many of them to be completed by early next
fiscal year, the report cited Biyani as saying. Biyani asked to
be contacted later when called on his mobile phone today.  Pantaloon, the country’s largest listed retailer, rose as
much as 2.9 percent to 159.95 rupees in Mumbai trading.  Future
Capital Holdings Ltd. (FCHL) , the group’s financial services company,
gained as much as 6.5 percent to 128 rupees, the biggest
intraday increase since Feb. 29.  Future Capital has more than a third of the total debt,
while  Pantaloon Retail  and its unit Future Value Retail Ltd.
each have borrowings of about 25 billion rupees, according to
the newspaper.  The group plans to reduce its focus on furniture and
electronics, and concentrate more on food and fashion retail,
according to the report. It will merge eZone, its electronic
retail chain, with a services company, the newspaper reported.  The group plans to seek partners and financial investors
for HomeTown, its furniture retail outlet network, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
