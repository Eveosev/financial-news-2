Australia is at the “foothills”
of developing shale gas with hundreds of trillion cubic feet of
resources that may be recovered, explorer  Origin Energy Ltd. (ORG) 
said.  “This isn’t short-term -- we’re at the foothills of
exploration,” Paul Zealand, chief executive officer of Origin’s
upstream business, said in an interview today in Sydney. “I
don’t think we’ll see commercial production in five years.”  Origin, building a $20 billion LNG project in Australia’s
Queensland state with  ConocoPhillips (COP) , is “always looking for
potential opportunities,” Zealand said, declining to be more
specific. “We’re looking in our own backyard.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
