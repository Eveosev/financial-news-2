Scott Allen , a former investment
adviser from Atlanta, will plead guilty today before U.S.
District Judge  Deborah Batts  in New York, his lawyer said.  Allen, who prosecutors said worked at Mercer LLC, and his
co-defendant, independent filmmaker  John Bennett , were charged
last year in a $2.6 million insider-trading scheme involving
drug-company acquisitions. The U.S. said Allen disclosed the
information to Bennett, who then traded on the tips and reaped
$1.1 million in profits.  “We are entering a guilty plea today as part of a
negotiated plea agreement with the government,” Brian McEvoy,
Allen’s lawyer, said today in an e-mailed statement. Allen was
scheduled to go on trial March 27.  Bennett, of Norwalk, Connecticut, worked for Merrill Lynch
& Co. from 2005 to 2007. He pleaded guilty in November to making
trades using nonpublic information from a friend about the April
2008 acquisition of  Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. (3437127Q)  by  Takeda
Pharmaceutical Co. (4502)  and the September 2009 purchase of Sepracor
Inc. by  Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma Co. (4506) , according to court
filings.  Bennett has acted in several films, including the 1990
courtroom drama “Presumed Innocent” and “Last Exit to
Brooklyn” according to the website IMDb.com. In 2008, he co-
founded Bennett Robbins Productions, which in 2010 produced
“Playback,” described on the company’s website as a
“supernatural thriller” starring Christian Slater.  During his guilty plea, Bennett told Batts he met his
colleague, identified by prosecutors as Allen, at Manhattan
restaurants and paid him an unspecified amount of money for the
tips. Bennett pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to
commit securities fraud and two counts of securities fraud.  The case is U.S. v. Bennett, 11-cr-927, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
