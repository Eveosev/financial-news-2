Gasoline rose to a 10-month high on
speculation that refinery closures because of low margins and
seasonal maintenance will lower supply as peak driving season
approaches.  Futures advanced as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  said today that it
will idle its Aruba refinery because it’s losing money. The
235,000-barrel-a-day plant supplies feedstocks to U.S. Gulf
Coast refiners for further upgrading into gasoline and diesel.  “It produces feedstocks that are processed in other
refineries,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates
LLC in Houston. “And the market is reacting to continuing
refinery maintenance on the Gulf Coast.”  Gasoline for April delivery rose 1.09 cents, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3.3678 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest settlement for the front-month
contract since May 10.  Futures have surged 25 percent this year, becoming the best
performer in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities.
Prices are approaching 2011’s high of $3.4648 reached April 29.  The 235,000-barrel-a-day Aruba refinery supplies feedstocks
to U.S.  Gulf Coast  refiners for further upgrading into gasoline
and diesel.  Along the U.S. East Coast, Sunoco Inc. and ConocoPhillips
last year idled unprofitable refineries in Pennsylvania with a
combined capacity of 363,000 barrels a day, or 24 percent of the
region’s capacity, according to the Energy Department. Sunoco
has said it will close its 335,000-barrel-a-day Philadelphia
refinery by July if it can’t find a buyer.  Hovensa  Hovensa LLC, a partnership of Hess Corp. and Petroleos de
Venezuela SA, shut its 350,000-barrel-a-day St. Croix refinery
in the  U.S. Virgin Islands  last month. That plant accounted for
18 percent of East Coast gasoline imports in December, Energy
Department data show.  “Aruba reinforces the worries if we do see a nice recovery
in gasoline demand, you don’t want to be caught short,” said
 Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford ,  Connecticut . “But fundamentally, we have weak
gasoline demand now.”  Gasoline  demand  over the four weeks ended March 9 dropped
7.2 percent from a year earlier, the Energy Department reported
March 14. Retail gasoline has jumped 17 percent this year,
according to Heathrow, Florida-based AAA.  Brent Declines  Gasoline touched $3.3846 before paring gains as  Brent
crude , the benchmark for oil used in European refineries that
export gasoline to the U.S. East Coast, declined in  London  after
data showed Saudi Arabian crude output at close to the largest
level in three decades.  Brent for May settlement on London’s ICE Futures Europe
exchange fell 10 cents to $125.71 a barrel. Brent’s premium to
West Texas Intermediate crude on Nymex narrowed a third straight
day, dropping 61 cents to $17.62.  “Brent is weaker and we’re seeing some profit taking in
heating oil,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in  New York . “We had some good economic news last
week and that is why gasoline is not following heating oil
today.”  Heating oil for April delivery fell 2.06 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $3.2613 gallon. Prices have gained 11
percent this year.  Regular gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.4
cent to $3.842 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA, the
nation’s biggest motoring group. Prices are 8.5 percent higher
than a year ago. Gasoline peaked in 2011 at $3.985 on May 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
