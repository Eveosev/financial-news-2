Francois Hollande , the Socialist
candidate in France’s presidential election campaign, said he
wants the  European Central Bank ’s mandate to include spurring
economic growth as well as maintaining price stability.  The ECB’s  injection of liquidity  over the past three months
was a step in the right direction, though it may need to go
further in the long run, Hollande said at a meeting of European
socialist parties in Paris on March 17.  The bank “has bolstered its intervention and that’s a
laudable change,” Hollande said, according to the text of the
speech. “It should also go further in playing its role as
lender of last resort. I know that this position isn’t shared
everywhere in  Europe  but we don’t rule out changing the
mandate” of the ECB, he added.  To contact the reporters on this story:
