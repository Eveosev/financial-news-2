MBIA Inc. (MBI) ’s four top executives
won’t receive a cash bonus or long-term incentive pay for 2011
after talks with the New York State Department of Financial
Services, the company said in a filing.  The bond insurer “concluded it was in the best interest of
the company” for Chief Executive Officer Jay Brown, Chief
Financial Officer Chuck Chaplin, Chief Operating Officer William
Fallon, and Chief Legal Officer Ram Wertheim to forego cash
bonuses or long-term incentive awards, according to a proxy
 filed  today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
today.  Kevin Brown , a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based MBIA,
declined to comment beyond the filing.  As the compensation program is based on pay for
performance, the decision “introduces the risk that our
compensation will no longer be effective in meeting our
objectives,” the company said.  Brown, who has no severance agreement, receives an annual
salary of $500,000, MBIA said in the filing today. He had
been eligible for an incentive bonus of as much as $2 million
“based on performance,” the company said. Chaplin and Fallon
received salaries of $750,000, and will remain at that level
next year with a maximum cash bonus of $3.375 million and long-
term stock awards of $1.5 million.  Compensation Details  Clifford Corso, chief investment officer, received a base
salary of $650,000 and a $548,500 performance-based cash bonus,
30 percent of the maximum, the company said in the filing. Corso
isn’t eligible for the company’s long-term incentive award.
Fallon rated his success 67.5 percent of his target bonus.  Anthony McKiernan, chief portfolio officer, received base
pay of $450,000 with a bonus of $1.75 million, or 78 percent of
his maximum potential award of $2.25 million, and a long-term
deferred long-term incentive award of $1 million in restricted
stock vesting in March 2017, according to the filing. The bonus
was in part based on his “successfully negotiating early policy
settlements of $32.4 billion in exposure that has eliminated a
substantial amount of potential loss volatility,” the company
said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
