Abbott Laboratories sued  Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  in Wilmington, Delaware, federal court for
allegedly infringing two patents for its Niaspan cholesterol
drug.  Abbott, based in  Abbott Park , Illinois, contends
Parsippany, New Jersey-based Watson is planning to market
generic versions of the medicine before the patents expire,
according to a complaint filed March 16.  Watson’s effort to sell the generic tablets “has led to
foreseeable harm and injury to Abbott,” according to the
lawsuit, which seeks a ruling of infringement and an order to
stop Watson’s premature sale of the drug.  Abbott logged about $1.2 billion in U.S. sales of  Niaspan 
in the 12 months ended Jan. 31, Watson said in a statement
citing IMS Health data. Watson confirmed in the statement that
it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for approval to sell its version of the extended-
release tablets.  The case is  Abbott Laboratories (ABT)  v. Watson Pharmaceuticals
Inc., 12-CV-324, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington).  To see the patents, click: 6,080,428 and 6,469,035.  To contact the reporter on this story:
