Cocoa-bean production in  Indonesia ,
the world’s third-largest grower, may plunge more than 11
percent in the next five years as farmers switch acres to more
lucrative oil-palm and rubber crops, according to a trade group.  Output of the chocolate ingredient could drop below 400,000
metric tons, the lowest level since 2004, as farmers turn to
crops that can boost their earnings by 150 percent per hectare,
said Zulhefi Sikumbang, chairman of the Indonesia Cocoa
Association. The harvest may reach 450,000 tons in 2012 after
435,000 tons last year, he said. The country produced 382,000
tons in 2004, the group’s data showed.  Cocoa climbed 7 percent this year, after a 31 percent drop
in 2011, on concerns that West African harvests will decline.
Global production has gained 15 percent to 3.96 million tons
since 2006-2007, says the International Cocoa Organization.
 Ivory Coast  is the biggest grower and Ghana the second.  “Farmers are more attracted to convert their crops into
other more valuable commodities, a trend that I’ve seen in the
past year,” Sikumbang said in a March 16 phone interview from
Jakarta. Cocoa trees, planted on about 1.5 million hectares (3.7
million acres), may decline to 1.3 million hectares in the next
five years, he said.  Lower yields because of aging trees, diseases and pests
have hurt incomes from cocoa plantations. Indonesian famers earn
about 8 million rupiah ($873) per year per hectare, compared
with more than 20 million rupiah from oil-palm and rubber
plantations, Sikumbang said. Rubber and palm-oil associations
confirmed the figures. Indonesia is the largest producer of  palm
oil  and the second-largest rubber grower.  Price Swings  About 90 percent of the world’s cocoa is produced on farms
of fewer than 5 hectares, which means producers often lack the
money needed to combat drought, floods or disease, according to
the ICCO. Prices have swung from $1,396 to $3,775 since 2006.  Exports from Indonesia may rise to 225,000 tons this year
from 200,000 tons in 2011, said Sikumbang. Local consumption is
stable at between 200,000 to 225,000 tons, he added.  Cocoa for May delivery was little changed at $2,259 a ton
on the ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , after a 1.6 percent advance
on March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
