Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields the most in a week, as optimism the  U.S. economy  will
strengthen spurred demand for higher-yielding, emerging-market
assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 declined two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 5.41 percent at 12:51 p.m. Lima time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The security’s price
rose 0.14 centimo to 116.15 centimos per sol.  “Evidence of a more sustainable recovery in the U.S and a
soft landing in China bodes well for the global risk outlook,”
said Aryam Vazquez, an emerging-markets economist at Wells Fargo
& Co. in New York.  U.S. stocks rallied last week and Treasuries fell after the
 Federal Open Market Committee  raised its assessment of the U.S.
economy. Activity is picking up and data suggest the recovery
may be strengthening, Federal Reserve Bank of  New York  President
William C. Dudley said today. China will avoid an economic hard-
landing as investment remains strong, said Zhu Min, a deputy
managing director at the  International Monetary Fund .  “Emerging markets will remain in a good position to
continue to attract flows and investments,” Vazquez said.  The extra yield investors demand to own Peruvian government
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell six basis points to 144,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
