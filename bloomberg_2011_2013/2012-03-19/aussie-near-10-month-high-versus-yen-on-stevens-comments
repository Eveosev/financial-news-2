Australia ’s dollar was 0.2 percent
from a 10-month high it touched earlier versus the yen as
 Reserve Bank  Governor  Glenn Stevens  expressed confidence in
economic growth in China, the South Pacific nation’s biggest
trading partner.  The so-called Aussie held gains against the dollar after
reaching the strongest in a week after Stevens said in a speech
today that China will “grow pretty strongly.” The so-called
kiwi reached an almost two-year high versus the yen after
reports signaled improvement in New Zealand’s services industry
and consumer confidence. Demand for both South Pacific
currencies was supported as Asian stocks rose.  “Stevens’ comments are generally supportive,” said  Todd Elmer , head of Group-of-10 foreign-exchange strategy for  Asia 
excluding  Japan  at Citigroup Inc. in Singapore. “The strength
of the Australian dollar, more than anything, reflects the fact
that it remains the single-most attractive investment in a risk-
on backdrop.”  The Australian dollar was at 88.46 yen at 5:16 p.m. in
Sydney after reaching 88.64, the most since May 2011. It rose to
$1.0605 from $1.0590 on March 16 and touched $1.0616, the
highest since March 9.  New Zealand’s currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 68.90
yen, after earlier climbing to 69.14, the highest since May
2010. It gained 0.2 percent to 82.61 U.S. cents, after touching
82.78, the most since March 8.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks advanced 0.2 percent.  RBA Policy  “ China  will have cycles like other economies, but it seems
likely that the Chinese economy will grow pretty strongly on
average for a while yet,” the Reserve Bank of Australia’s
Stevens said at a Credit Suisse Group AG conference in  Hong Kong 
today. The RBA held the overnight cash rate at 4.25 percent on
March 6 as policy makers “judged that the setting of monetary
policy remained appropriate for the moment,” Stevens said in a
statement after the decision.  Traders are expecting the central bank to cut its key rate
by 38 basis points over the next 12 months, a Credit Suisse
 index  based on swaps showed. That’s down from 53 basis points of
reductions signaled last week.  Australian  government bonds  declined, pushing the yield on
 10-year securities  up by three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 4.26 percent. The yield breached 4.25 percent on March
15, putting the 10-year rate above the RBA benchmark for the
first time since August.  Aussie Net Longs  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on an advance in the Australian dollar
compared with those on a drop -- so-called net longs -- was
66,756 on March 13, compared with net longs of 61,720 a week
earlier, figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission showed.  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive floating rates, rose five basis points to 3.14 percent.  The  Performance of Services Index  compiled by the Bank of
New Zealand Ltd. and Business NZ climbed to 55.5 in February
from a revised 53.8 the previous month, according to figures
released today. A gauge of  household sentiment  advanced to 102.4
in the first quarter from 101.3 in the three months through
December, a separate report by  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
McDermott Miller Ltd. showed.  The kiwi has appreciated 4.6 percent this year, the best
performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Aussie has risen 2
percent in the same period, the third-biggest gainer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
