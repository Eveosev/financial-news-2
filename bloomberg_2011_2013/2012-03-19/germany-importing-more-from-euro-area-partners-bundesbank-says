Germany  is importing more from its
euro-area partners, almost halving its current-account surplus
with them since 2007, the Bundesbank said.  The surplus fell to 57 billion euros ($75 billion) last
year from 108 billion four years earlier, the Frankfurt-based
Bundesbank said in its monthly report today. Germany’s overall
current account, a measure of all trade including services,
declined to 147.7 billion euros in 2011 from 150.7 billion euros
in 2010, due primarily to rising import prices, it said.  Germany, the world’s biggest exporter after  China , has been
accused by the U.S. and other Group of 20 nations of fueling
global imbalances by focusing on exports and not stimulating
 consumer spending  enough. German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  has
rejected a U.S proposal to limit current-account surpluses or
deficits to 4 percent of gross domestic product.  Germany’s current-account surplus amounted for 5.75 percent
of GDP last year, down from 6 percent in 2010, the Bundesbank
said today. German imports grew 13.2 percent in 2011, outpacing
the 11.4 percent increase in exports. Imports from other euro-
area nations rose 13.4 percent last year while exports to the
region gained 8.4 percent.  “The strong increase in import prices and the sustained
moderation in increases in export prices led to a considerable
outflow of income abroad,” the Bundesbank said. “In addition,
trade in goods couldn’t maintain the pace of expansion that it
had in 2010.”  The central bank, which forecasts 0.6 percent economic
growth for 2012 after 3 percent last year, said German companies
are optimistic about the outlook even as the economy struggles
to avoid a recession amid the sovereign debt crisis.  Europe ’s largest economy contracted 0.2 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2011 and may have been hampered further by
unusually cold weather in February.  “The German economy may still be moving sideways,
continuing the path it started toward the end of last year,”
the Bundesbank said. “However the confidence indicators signal
a rejuvenation of the economy in the early part of 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
