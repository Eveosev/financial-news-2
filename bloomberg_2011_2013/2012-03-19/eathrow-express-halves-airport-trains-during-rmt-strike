National Union of Rail, Maritime
and Transport representatives rejected a revised offer on  work
conditions  and pay during this yearâ€™s Olympic Games in  London .  A convening of 150 RMT officials refused the offer as it
excludes drivers and administrative workers, and proposed that
the union executive seek bonus pay for all workers, the labor
union said today in an e-mailed statement. The suggestion will
be considered by the executive this week, the union said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
