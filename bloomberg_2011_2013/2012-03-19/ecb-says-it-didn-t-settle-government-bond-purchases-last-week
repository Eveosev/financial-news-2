The  European Central Bank  didn’t
settle any government bond purchases last week.  The Frankfurt-based ECB said today it settled no bond
purchases in the week ended March 16 after buying 27 million
euros of assets the previous week as part of the Securities
Markets Program. It will take seven-day term deposits tomorrow
to absorb the 218 billion euros ($287 billion) of liquidity
created since the program started in May 2010, a practice it
employs to ensure the purchases don’t fuel inflation.  The purchases have dwindled since the ECB started offering
banks unlimited three-year loans in December, injecting more
than 1 trillion euros into the system. That has helped drive a
bond-market rally and reduced the need for the central bank to
intervene. ECB council member Erkki Liikanen said in an
interview on March 15 that the ECB “has done its part, the
governments must do theirs.”  The ECB says its bond purchases are aimed solely at
ensuring its  interest rates  are transmitted on financial
markets. The program has nevertheless split the central bank’s
policy makers, some of whom say it blurs the line between
monetary and fiscal policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
