The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
rose 0.5 percent to 998.9 at the end of trading in Prague, its
second day of gains.  The following were among the most active equities in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s biggest power utility, rose
for a second day, adding 1.1 percent to 810 koruna. Electricity
for next-year delivery in  Germany , where CEZ exports part of its
output, gained 0.6 percent to 52.8 euros per megawatt-hour.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)   slid 2.8 percent to 132.5
koruna, its lowest close since December. The Czech mining
company last week lost its buy recommendation at Erste Group
Bank AG and Citigroup Inc., with both banks citing lowered
expectations for NWR’s coking-coal output as a reason for the
stock’s downgrade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
