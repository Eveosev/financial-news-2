Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened as
economists estimate a report tomorrow will show export orders
rebounded last month, bolstering the outlook for capital
inflows.  The currency gained 2.6 percent this year as foreign funds
bought $4.8 billion more local shares than they sold, according
to exchange data. Orders for the island’s goods probably rose
11.5 percent from a year earlier, after falling 8.6 percent the
previous month, according to the median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. The central bank meets to decide on
borrowing costs this week, with all nine analysts surveyed
predicting the benchmark rate will be held at 1.875 percent.  “Foreign inflows have led to surges in the  Taiwan
dollar ,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-income trader at
Cathay United Bank Co. “Trading volume in bonds has
significantly shrunk in the past week or so ahead of the rate
meeting this week.”  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.1 percent to NT$29.532
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
that traders use to price options, fell 20 basis points, or 0.2
percentage point, to 4.50 percent.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent government bonds due
March 2022 dropped 0.5 basis point to 1.29 percent, according to
Gretai Securities Market. The rate reached 1.3 percent on March
15, the highest level for a benchmark 10-year note since Feb.
10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Ministry of
Finance will release its second-quarter bond-auction plan on
March 23.  The overnight  money-market  rate was little changed at 0.398
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
