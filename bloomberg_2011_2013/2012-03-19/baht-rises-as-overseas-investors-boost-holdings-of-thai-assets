Thailand ’s baht strengthened for a
second day as global funds raised holdings of the nation’s
assets on optimism growth in Southeast Asia’s second-biggest
economy will pick up this year.  Overseas investors purchased $293 million more Thai
equities than they sold last week and bought a net $855 million
of government debt, according to data from the stock exchange
and the Thai Bond Market Association. German Chancellor  Angela
Merkel  said European officials have discussed combining euro-
area bailout funds to reinforce the region’s financial firewall.  “It’s clear the Thai economy will rebound this year,”
said  Hideki Hayashi , a researcher at the Japan Center for
Economic Research in  Tokyo . “Speculation of a strengthening
safety net in the  euro zone  further improves risk sentiment in
the market, which supports regional currencies.”  The baht advanced 0.2 percent to 30.68 per dollar as of
8:34 a.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The currency has appreciated 2.9 percent this year. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of foreign-exchange swings used to
price options, was unchanged at 6.5250.  Thailand’s gross domestic product may increase 5.5 percent
to 6.5 percent this year, compared with  growth  of 0.1 percent
last year, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said on March 7.  The yield on the 3.25 percent notes due June 2017 climbed
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.65 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
