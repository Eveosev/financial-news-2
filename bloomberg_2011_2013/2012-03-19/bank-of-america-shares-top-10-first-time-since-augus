Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. lender by assets, topped $10 in  New York  trading
for the first time since August amid a rally that began after
the firm passed the Federal Reserve stress test.  Bank of America rose 2.5 percent to $10.04 at 12:06 p.m. in
New York. The  Charlotte , North Carolina-based firm has advanced
about 18 percent since the Fed said March 13 that all but four
of the 19 largest U.S. banks could withstand a severe recession.  Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  didn’t ask for
permission to raise the 1-cent dividend, thus preserving the
minimum capital needed to meet Fed targets for a hypothetical
crisis. Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit’s request for increased
payouts made his firm the biggest lender to fail the test.  Moynihan, 52, sold $33 billion in assets last year to boost
capital levels. The bank’s financial strength improved in the
fourth quarter as Tier 1 common equity, a measure of its ability
to absorb losses, rose to 9.86 percent from 8.65 percent in the
previous three-month period.  The firm has surged about 81 percent this year amid signs
that the  U.S. economy  is gaining strength, easing potential
future loan losses. Bank of America declined 58 percent last
year over concern that rising mortgage expenses and the European
debt crisis would weigh on results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
