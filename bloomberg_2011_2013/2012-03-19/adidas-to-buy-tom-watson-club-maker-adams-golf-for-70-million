Adidas AG (ADS) , owner of the TaylorMade
brand, agreed to buy  Adams Golf Inc. (ADGF)  for $70 million to
strengthen its position as the world’s leading golf supplier.  The German company will pay $10.80 a share in cash for
Plano, Texas-based Adams, whose clubs are used by players
including  Tom Watson  and Kenny Perry. The transaction is
expected to close mid-2012, Adidas said today in a statement.  The offer price is 71 percent higher than immediately prior
to Adams’ Jan. 4 announcement that it hired Morgan Stanley to
review strategic alternatives that may include a sale. Adidas,
which gets almost 8 percent of revenue from TaylorMade, said the
deal will be financed through cash or existing credit lines.  “This acquisition reflects our commitment to continued
growth in the golf category,” Adidas Chief Executive Officer
 Herbert Hainer  said in the statement.  Adams Golf rose as much as 9.5 percent in New York trading
and was up 8.8 percent at $10.73 as of 1:17 p.m. Adidas fell 0.1
percent to 59.03 euros at the close of trading in Frankfurt.  Adams Golf, founded by Chairman Barney H. Adams in 1987,
boosted sales 12 percent to $96.5 million in the 12 months ended
Dec. 31. After posting a net loss of $12.2 million in 2009, the
company has made money in seven of the past eight quarters.  “This merger provides strong opportunities for our
employees, suppliers and partners,” Adams said in the release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
