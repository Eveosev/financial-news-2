Nisshin Steel Co. (5407) , the smallest of
 Japan ’s five blast-furnace mills, and  Nippon Metal Industry Co. (5479) 
agreed to merge and create a bigger stainless steel producer to
compete with overseas rivals.  Nisshin Steel President Toshinori Miki will be president of
the new company that will be created by Oct. 1, the two
companies said today in a statement. Nisshin Steel shareholders
will receive 0.1 share of the holding company for each share
they own, while Nippon Metal shareholders will get 0.056 share,
they said.  The domestic steelmakers announced they were in talks about
a merger in November to gain pricing power and compete against
larger international rivals. An aging population and a sluggish
domestic economy have curbed demand for stainless steel used in
kitchens and buildings, while the yen’s appreciation means
Japanese-made steel is less competitive.  The merger will likely boost pretax  profit  from operations
by 13 billion yen ($156 million) a year by March 2016, the
statement said. Nisshin Steel and Nippon Metal together earned
net income of 12.3 billion yen in the financial year ended March
31 2011 on sales of 638.5 billion yen.  The combined company will have 10 directors, eight
executives from Nisshin Steel and two from Nippon Metal, the
statement said. Nisshin Chairman Hideo Suzuki will become
chairman of the holding company.  Nisshin Steel closed unchanged at 145 yen on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange. Nippon Metal Industry traded at 76 yen,
unchanged from March 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
