The head of the International
Committee of the  Red Cross  asked Russia today to help persuade
 Syria  to provide humanitarian access as fighting escalates in
the Middle Eastern country.  ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger met Foreign Minister
 Sergei Lavrov  in Moscow to raise concerns about the inability to
provide aid and medical evacuations in conflict areas, according
to an e-mailed statement from the Geneva-based body.  “The ICRC is talking to all those who could have a
positive influence on its work in Syria,” the Red Cross said.
“It is a matter of utmost urgency that the ICRC be able to
extend its assistance and protection activities.” Lavrov told
Kellenberger that Russia was keen to resolve “the difficult
humanitarian problems” in Syria, in televised remarks at the
start of their meeting.  A year of violence in Syria since President Bashar al-Assad
started a crackdown on an anti-government uprising has claimed
more than 8,000 lives, according to United Nations estimates.
Veto-wielding UN Security Council members Russia and  China  have
blocked Western and Arab demands for Assad’s resignation,
arguing for talks between the Syrian leader and his opponents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
