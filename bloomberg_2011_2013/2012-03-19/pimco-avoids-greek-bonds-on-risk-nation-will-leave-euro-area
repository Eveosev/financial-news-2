Pacific Investment Management Co.
says it is avoiding the debt of  Greece , Ireland and Portugal and
sees a “significant risk” the former will leave the 17-nation
euro-region.  The company, which manages the world’s biggest bond fund,
is also “cautious” on the bonds of Spain, Italy, France, and
other countries to Europe’s so-called core, Andrew Balls,
London-based head of European portfolio management, said in an
interview published on the company’s website.  “Greece’s exit from the Eurozone remains a significant
risk and one that could lead to contagion across the Eurozone,”
Balls said in the interview. “It is also far from clear that
Portugal is on a sustainable path.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
