One Equity Partners LLC,  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s buyout arm, sold its remaining stake in  AMAG
Austria Metall AG (AMAG)  to B&C Industrieholding GmbH and
Raiffeisenlandesbank Oberoesterreich AG.  B&C, which already owns shares in  Lenzing AG (LNZ) ,  Semperit AG (SEM) 
and  Allgemeine Baugesellschaft Porr AG (POS) , agreed to buy a 29.9
percent stake in the Austrian aluminum maker, while RLB OOe
acquired 4.7 percent, boosting its holding to 16.44 percent,
according to statements from the companies. The companies didn’t
say how much they paid for the AMAG stakes. On the basis of
AMAG’s closing share price on March 16, the stakes are valued at
about 233 million euros ($307 million), according to Bloomberg
calculations.  Funds advised by One Equity took control of AMAG in 2010
when it bought Constantia Packaging AG. It sold most of its
shares in AMAG in an initial public offering in Vienna last
year.  B&C Chief Executive Officer Michael Junghans said last year
that B&C, which is the investment vehicle of a non-profit
foundation dedicated to “promote Austrian entrepreneurship,”
was looking for a “fourth pillar” to compliment its holding in
Lenzing, Semperit and Porr.  To contact the reporter on this story:
