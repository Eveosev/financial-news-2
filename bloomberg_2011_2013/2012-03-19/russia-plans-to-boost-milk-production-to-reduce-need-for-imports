Russia  plans to boost domestic milk
production by almost 20 percent by 2020 and further reduce the
need for imports,  Yelena Skrynnik , agriculture minister, said.  Milk output will climb to 38 million metric tons from about
32 million tons last year, Skrynnik said in Moscow today.
Production rose about 4 percent in the first two months this
year as imports declined 18 percent in January, she said.  “Duties on imports of dry milk, cheese and butter
are increasing, and we are bringing up output and reducing
production costs because of government subsidies,” said Andrei
Danilenko, head of  Russia’s National Milk Producers Union  in
Moscow. Last year, imports of dry fat-free milk dropped about 40
percent whole dry milk shipments fell about 51 percent,
according to data from the union.  This year, the government will spend more than 5 billion
rubles ($171 million) to support dairy cow farms, Skrynnik said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Marina Sysoyeva in Moscow
