First City Monument Bank Plc (FCMB) , a
Nigerian lender, posted a full-year loss of 9.9 billion naira
($62.8 million) in 2011, compared with a profit of 7.9 billion
naira a year earlier, as it took an impairment charge.  Revenue rose 28 percent to 80.4 billion naira, the Lagos-
based lender said today in an e-mailed statement.  Results were “affected by a significant impairment charge
of 29 billion naira in the fourth quarter of 2011,” the bank
said. “All legacy loans and weaknesses associated with  capital
market  and oil and gas transactions have been fully
regularised” through sales to the Asset Management Corp. of
 Nigeria  or provisioning or write-off, the lender added.  Nigerian lenders are cleaning their books of non-performing
loans after the  central bank  implemented a banking-sector reform
following a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009 that threatened the
industry with a collapse. The  Central Bank of Nigeria  fired the
chief executives of eight of the country’s 24 banks and asked
those that failed an audit to recapitalize, be acquired by
others, or face liquidation.  FCMB, which completed the acquisition of Finbank Plc, a
lender bailed out by the central bank in 2009, in February, fell
to a three-month low on March 15 after saying would report a
full-year loss. The stock gained 2.5 percent today, its first
rise since Mar. 2, to 3.70 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in
Lagos.  FCMB management expects that the first half of 2012 will
see continued improvement and is likely to exceed its released
forecasts, according to the statement. Management also
anticipates improved earnings in the second half of this year,
following the Finbank merger, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
