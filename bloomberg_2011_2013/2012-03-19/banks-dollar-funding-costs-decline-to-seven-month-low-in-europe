The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined to the lowest in seven months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into dollars, was 58 basis
points below the euro interbank offered rate at 8:40 a.m. in
 London , from minus 60 on March 16, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That’s the lowest cost since Aug. 4.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 50 basis
points less than Euribor, the cheapest since Aug. 31. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the
borrowing benchmark and overnight indexed swaps, was unchanged
at 49 basis points, the lowest since Aug. 3. The measure was 95
basis points at the start of the year.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  on March 16, placing 759 billion euros
($998 billion) with the ECB from 729 billion euros on March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
