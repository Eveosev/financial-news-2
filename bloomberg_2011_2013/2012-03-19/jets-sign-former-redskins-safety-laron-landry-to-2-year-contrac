The  New York Jets  agreed in
principle on contract terms with free-agent safety LaRon Landry,
a two-time Pro Bowl alternate who missed 15 games the past two
National Football League seasons due to injury.  Team spokesman Bruce Speight said in an e-mail yesterday
that details of the deal with the 27-year-old Landry were not
available.  “After spending time with the organization as a whole, I
just felt that signing with the Jets was the right thing to
do,” Landry said in a statement posted on the team’s website.  Selected sixth overall by the Washington Redskins in the
2007 NFL Draft, Landry was sidelined for parts of the past two
seasons with hamstring, groin and Achilles tendon injuries. In
eight games last season he had 1 1/2 sacks, one forced fumble
and 48 tackles.  New York  was looking for a safety to replace  Jim Leonhard ,
who is a free agent after missing the final three games of the
2011 season with a knee injury, and Leonhard’s replacement,
Brodney Pool, who signed last week with the  Dallas Cowboys . The
Jets made an offer to Reggie Nelson of the  Cincinnati Bengals ,
and were also interested in Brandon Meriweather, who has signed
with the Redskins, according to ESPN.  Landry was a Pro Bowl alternate in 2007 and 2008, when he
had two interceptions and forced two fumbles. New York’s
safeties combined for three interceptions last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
