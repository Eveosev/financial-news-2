Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) ,
 Spain ’s biggest wind-turbine maker, plans to invest 3 billion
rupees ($60 million) in power transmission infrastructure in
India’s southern Tamil Nadu state, a company official said.  Gamesa, which is the third-biggest supplier of turbines in
India, will build a 400-kilovolt substation that will help
distribute 750 megawatts of power, Ramesh Kymal, head of its
India unit, said in a March 16 interview in Chennai.  Tamil Nadu’s aging power infrastructure is suffering
bottlenecks that have been crimping investment in new generation
projects and forcing wind farms to shut down when the grid is
unable to cope.  The state is home to 42 percent of India’s wind capacity,
according to the Indian Wind Turbine Manufacturers’ Association.
In the last financial year, 93 percent of the capacity Gamesa
installed in  India  was in the state, according to the IWTMA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
