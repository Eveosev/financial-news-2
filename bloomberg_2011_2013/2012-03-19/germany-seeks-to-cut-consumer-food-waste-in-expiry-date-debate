Germany  plans to reduce food waste
by raising awareness among consumers that best-by dates are
guidelines, as opposed to deadlines for when it’s safe to eat
products, the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Ministry said.  The ministry has started a campaign to inform retailers
about expiration dates and will distribute 4 million leaflets
and information cards in 21,000 German supermarkets, it said in
a  statement  on its website today.  Every German citizen, on average, discards 82 kilograms
(181 pounds) of food a year at home, equivalent to two packed
shopping carts, according to the ministry.  “The best-by date is not a throw-away date, but a guide,”
Agriculture Minister  Ilse Aigner  was cited as saying in the
statement. “In general, a product is still perfectly edible for
several days even after the best-by date.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
