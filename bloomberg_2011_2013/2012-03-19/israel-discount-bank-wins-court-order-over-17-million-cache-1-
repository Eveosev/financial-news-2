Israel Discount Bank of  New York 
won a contempt order against  Delaware ’s  First State Depository 
Co. after asking a judge to preserve $17 million in coins and
bullion being held as collateral for loans.  Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald F. Parsons Jr. today
imposed a $5,000-a-day fine on the depository company until it
complies with a Feb. 29 order that gave IDB the right to have
the coins returned to Delaware for safe-keeping, inspection and
appraisal.  First State’s failure to comply with the so-called
preliminary injunction “is inexcusable,” Parsons wrote in a
court filing. He rejected First State’s argument that it
shouldn’t be held in contempt because IDB already has access to
enough collateral to protect the loan it made.  IDB claims Wilmington-based First State is trying to sell
some of the assets without permission, in violation of the
collateral agreement. The assets include more than 12,000 rare
presidential or  Sacagawea dollar coins  with missing edge
markings, other collector-quality gold and silver coins, and
bullion, according to court papers.  Joseph Cicero, IDB’s lawyer, and Daniel Crossland,
representing First State, didn’t immediately respond to phone
calls seeking comment on the ruling.  The case is Israel Discount Bank v. First State Depository,
CA7237, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
