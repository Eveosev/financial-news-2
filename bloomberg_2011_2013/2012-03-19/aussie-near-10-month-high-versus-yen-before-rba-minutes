Australia’s dollar dropped for the
first time in four days on speculation China’s economic growth
will slow, damping demand for the South Pacific nation’s
exports.  The Aussie weakened versus the yen after reaching a 10-
month high yesterday as Melbourne-based  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
world’s largest mining company, said steel production is slowing
in China, Australia’s biggest trading partner. Australia’s
dollar pared earlier gains that followed the publication of
central bank minutes showing officials saw less downside risk to
the economy at this month’s meeting. New Zealand’s currency slid
as Asian stocks declined.  “There will be further risk that the Chinese economy will
be slowing down” more than expected, said Lee Wai Tuck, a
currency strategist at Forecast Pte in Singapore. “The Aussie
is still a sell on rallies at the moment.”  Australia’s dollar lost 1.1 percent to $1.0490 at 11:23
a.m. in  New York  after earlier climbing as much as 0.2 percent.
The Aussie slid 0.9 percent to 87.57 yen.  Yesterday it rose as
high as 88.64, the highest since May 2011.  New Zealand ’s
currency fell 1.2 percent to 81.54 U.S. cents and slid 1 percent
to 68.16 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent after
earlier declining as much as 0.9 percent.  “The big infrastructure build clearly will come to some
end,” BHP’s Ian Ashby, president of  iron ore , told reporters
today in Perth. “Steel growth rates will flatten, and they have
flattened, and we still see positive growth out to the middle of
the next decade.”  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  this month announced an economic
growth target of 7.5 percent for this year, down from an annual
8 percent during the past seven years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
