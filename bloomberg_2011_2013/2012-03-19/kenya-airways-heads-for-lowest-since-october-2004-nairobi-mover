Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
 Africa ’s third-biggest airline, headed for the lowest in more
than seven years on speculation a planned rights offer will
dilute the value of existing shares.  The stock declined 1.3 percent to 14.95 shillings by 1:25
p.m. in Nairobi. A close at that level would be the lowest since
October 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “As we expect the rights to start trading in the market,
there is a likelihood that the dilution effect will have an
impact on the share price,” Eric Munywoki, a research analyst
at Nairobi-based Dyer & Blair Investment Bank Ltd., said in a
telephone interview today.  The airline will offer 1.48 billion shares at a ratio of 16
for every five held at 14 shillings each in a rights offer that
opens April 2 and closes April 18, it said on March 12.
Investors have until the end of today to buy stock in order to
take part in the offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
