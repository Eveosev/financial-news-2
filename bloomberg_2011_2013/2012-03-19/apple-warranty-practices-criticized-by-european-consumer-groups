Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s advertising of product
warranty practices was criticized by a group of European
consumer organizations ahead of an Italian case over the issue.  Apple products say they come with a one-year warranty when
 European Union law  requires manufacturers cover goods for two
years, consumer groups in 11 countries, including Italy and
 Germany , said in an e-mailed statement today. The groups said
they sent letters to national regulators seeking an immediate
halt to Apple’s practices on the guarantees.  Apple will challenge a 900,000-euro ($1.18 million) fine
from the Italian competition regulator at a March 21 hearing.
The regulator in December said Apple breached EU legislation for
unfair commercial practices and misled consumers by
“prominently advertising” that its products have a one-year
manufacturer warranty, and through the sale of its “AppleCare
Protection Plan” warranty extension.  “Consumers should not be misled and confused as to
fundamental EU consumer rights because a company wants to sell
their commercial warranty services,” Monique Goyens, director
general of the European Consumer Organization, said in the
statement. Goyens, who said consumers in the EU are entitled to
a guarantee of at least two years, added the case is “even more
important” as it concerns a market leader, whose practices have
a “wide impact.”  Alan Hely, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based
Apple in  London , didn’t have an immediate comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
