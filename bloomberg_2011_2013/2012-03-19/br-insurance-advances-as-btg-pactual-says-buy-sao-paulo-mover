Brasil Insurance Participacoes e
Administracao SA (BRIN3)  gained to the highest level in two weeks after
Banco BTG Pactual said the company was its top pick in the
industry and recommended clients buy the stock.  Shares in the company, which writes policies for marine
transportation as well as automobiles and health as Brazil’s
fourth-biggest insurer, climbed 1.5 percent to 20 reais at 11:51
a.m in  Sao Paulo , and earlier rose 3.1 percent to the highest
intraday level since March 5.  “Although we are positive on the insurance sector, we are
less bullish on auto and health,” analysts Marcelo Henriques
and Eduardo Rosman wrote in a report to clients today. BR
Insurance “is the best vehicle to play the Brazilian insurance
space” at this point, they wrote.  BR Insurance has made three acquisitions since the
beginning of this year totaling 19.55 million reais ($10.8
million), according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Shares gained
16 percent this year through March 16.  BTG initiated coverage of  Porto Seguro SA (PSSA3) , which sells auto
insurance, and  Sul America SA (SULA3) , a health insurer, with neutral
recommendations. Porto Seguro lost 0.5 percent to 20.69 reais,
extending its decline after losing 2.3 percent this year through
last week. Sul America rose 0.01 percent to 17.34 reais. It had
gained 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
