Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a ninth
straight day against the dollar, reaching the lowest in almost
18 years, as importers bought the U.S. currency.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
depreciated 0.9 percent to 1.7603 per dollar by 2:05 p.m. in
Accra, the capital. That’s the lowest since May 31, 1994, when
Bloomberg began compiling the data.  “We have seen general demand for the dollar pick up,
linked to expansion of the economy,” Chris Nettey, a currency
trader at the Ghanaian unit of Standard Bank Group Ltd., said by
phone. “Today we saw continued buying from telecommunication
and manufacturing companies to import equipment and raw
material, and then, the commerce industry to import goods for
resale.”  Ghana’s $31 billion economy is projected to grow 7.3
percent this year, faster than the sub-Saharan African average
of 5.5 percent, according to the  International Monetary Fund .
The government has forecast growth of 9.4 percent.  That expansion, led by the December 2010 start of oil
production for export, has driven dollar demand from companies
keen to invest in  Africa ’s second-biggest gold producer. The
cedi has declined 6.8 percent this year against the dollar.  “We are getting some dollar sales from exporters, but they
cannot match the demand on the market,” Nettey said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
