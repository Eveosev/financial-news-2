(Corrects period of gain in first paragraph.)  Xing AG (O1BC) , the German professional
networking provider, had the biggest increase in three years in
Frankfurt trading after WirtschaftsWoche reported that publisher
Hubert Burda holds options that would take his stake to more
than 30 percent.  Xing  gained  15 percent to 56.52 euros at the close, marking
the biggest increase since March 2009.  “There’s a certain level of takeover fantasy at play given
Burda’s track record of buying into Internet and social media
companies,” Marcus Silbe, an analyst for Close Brothers Seydler
Research AG in Frankfurt, said by phone. “If he crosses the 30
percent threshold then he’ll have to make a mandatory takeover
offer.”  Silbe raised his rating on Xing to “Buy” from “Hold”
today, with a 60 euro target price.  Hubert Burda Media GmbH spokesman Nikolaus von der Decken
declined to comment on the takeover speculation.  Xing disclosed the put options in a March 14 statement to
the stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
