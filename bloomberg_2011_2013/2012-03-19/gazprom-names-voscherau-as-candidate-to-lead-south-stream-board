OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , developer of the
planned South Stream natural-gas pipeline, named Henning
Voscherau, former president of Germany’s upper house of
parliament, as a candidate to lead the project’s board.  Voscherau may be formally nominated as chairman of South
Stream Transport AG in April, Moscow-based Gazprom said today in
an e-mailed statement. The project, which Gazprom is developing
with  Eni SpA (ENI) , would carry Russian gas across the  Black Sea  to
 Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
