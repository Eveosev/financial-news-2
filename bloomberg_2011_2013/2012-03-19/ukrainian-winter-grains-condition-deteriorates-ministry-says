Ukrainian winter grains, composed
mostly of wheat, are in worse condition than in January, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said, without giving a reason.  Grains were classified as in good condition on 1.68 million
hectares (4.15 million acres) as of March 15, according to a
statement published the next day on the Kiev-based ministry’s
website. That was down from 1.89 million hectares as of Jan. 19.  Winter grains sprouted on 7.3 million hectares, or 87
percent of sown areas, as of March 15, the ministry said. Plants
were judged to be satisfactory on 2.88 million hectares and weak
on 2.1 million hectares.  To contact the reporters on this story:
