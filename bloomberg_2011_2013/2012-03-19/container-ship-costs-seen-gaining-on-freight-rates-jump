The cost of leasing  container ships 
will rise after freight rates jumped 40 percent this year,
according to  Seaspan Corp. (SSW) , which owns 72 of the vessels.  Higher prices to ship boxloads of manufactured goods always
lead to higher charter rates for the ships that carry them,
Gerry Wang, chief executive officer, said March 16 by phone from
 Vancouver . As operators benefit from the rate increases, they
will pay more to owners such as Seaspan, he said.  “Freight rates are increasing like crazy right now, and
there’s tremendous positive sentiment,” he said. “When freight
rates are good, charter rates always come up.”  After a price war cost $11.4 billion over 14 months,
according to SeaIntel Maritime Analysis, operators agreed to
raise prices.  Box rates  climbed 40 percent this year to $1,992
per 40-foot unit on the China-to-U.S. route, according to data
from  Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the world’s largest shipbroker.  Rates paid  to
owners to hire the vessels rose 1.3 percent from the 21-month
low reached Feb. 28, data from the Hamburg Shipbrokers’
Association show.  Seaspan’s multi-year contracts protect earnings from market
trends, and the Hong Kong-based company hasn’t had customers
fail to pay for their charters, Wang said.  Four of the company’s smaller vessels with total capacity
of 16,000 units will end their charters this year, Wang said. He
said he expects them to find new leases for about $10,000 a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
