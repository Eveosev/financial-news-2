Brazilian homebuilder  Camargo
Correa Desenvolvimento Imobiliario SA (CCIM3)   jumped  to a seven-month
high after saying parent Camargo Correa SA plans to buy its
outstanding shares and delist the company’s stock.  Shares gained 7.6 percent to 4.56 reais at 11:33 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo , after earlier rising to as much as 4.61 reais, the
highest intraday price since Aug. 1. The BM&F Bovespa Real
Estate index fell 0.1 percent.  Camargo Correa SA plans to buy 38.2 million outstanding
shares of CCDI, as the subsidiary is known, at 4.70 reais each,
and delist the company from the BM&FBovespa exchange, according
to a regulatory filing after the market closed on March 16.  “The decision of the controlling group to delist CCDI
could not be more appropriate,” Guilherme Rocha, Daniel
Gasparete and  Vanessa Quiroga , analysts at Credit Suisse, wrote
in a report to clients on March 18. CCDI “was  never able  to
reach the desired economies of scale and profitability to be a
self-sustained business model.”  CCDI lost 68 percent since its initial public offering in
January 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
