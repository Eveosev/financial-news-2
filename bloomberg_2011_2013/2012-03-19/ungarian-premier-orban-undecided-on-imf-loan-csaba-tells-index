Hungarian Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  hasn’t decided whether the country needs a bailout from
the  International Monetary Fund , economist Laszlo Csaba said in
an interview with website  Index , citing meetings with Orban.  ’’It’s now absolutely 50-50,’’ Csaba said when asked how he
thinks Orban will decide. “Three months ago it wasn’t in doubt,
but today the fate of the IMF loan is most dependent on what is
decided inside the Cabinet.”  Csaba is one of about 10 economists Orban has invited for
meetings to discuss his policies, along with Zsigmond Jarai,
head of the central bank’s supervisory board, and Gyorgy Barcza,
an analyst at  KBC Groep NV (KBC) ’s  K&H Bank (KHBK)  unit.  “If they can’t come to an agreement for one reason or
other, that’s bearable too,” Csaba said of the government’s
potential talks with the IMF. “That must be understood so that
no panic starts on the market because of that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
