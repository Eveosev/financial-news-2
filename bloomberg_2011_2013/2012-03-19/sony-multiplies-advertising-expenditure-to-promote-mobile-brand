Sony Corp. (6758)  may triple ad spending
this year in markets such as the U.S. to promote its mobile
phones after buying out partner Ericsson AB.  “In many key territories we are making two to three times
the investment we were able to make in 2011,” said Steve
Walker, chief marketing officer at Sony Mobile Communications.
Other important markets include the U.K., Germany, Brazil,
Russia, India and  China , he said.  Sony paid $1.5 billion to take over smartphone maker Sony
Ericsson Mobile Communications AB, betting that content
integration with televisions and other Sony products will make
its handsets stand out against  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ’s Galaxy
series and  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone. The division appointed McCann
Worldgroup as its global agency, with LBi as its global digital
agency and the PHD unit of Omnicom replacing MEC as its global
media buyer.  “This marks the return of the Sony brand to mobile after a
10-year absence,” Walker said. “It’s important that we get our
share of market growth.” Tokyo-based Sony completed the
purchase of the unit last month.  The “Made of Imagination” campaign will include a 60-
second television commercial made by director Wes Anderson as
well as print, digital, outdoor and retail elements, he said. It
will compete with Microsoft Corp. and Nokia Oyj’s international
advertising campaign, which is designed to establish  brand
recognition  for Nokia’s Lumia Windows Phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
