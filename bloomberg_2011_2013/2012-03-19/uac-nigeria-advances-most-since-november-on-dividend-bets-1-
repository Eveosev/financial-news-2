UAC of Nigeria Plc , a food-products
maker and fast-food restaurant operator, rose the most since
November on speculation it will pay a full-year dividend.  The stock rose 5 percent, the daily limit and the most
since Nov. 1, to 30.45 naira at the close in in Lagos, the
commercial capital, reducing its decline this year to 2.3
percent.  Nine-month results were “very impressive, so investors are
taking positions in the hope that it will pay a dividend,”
David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth Trust and
Investment Co., a Lagos-based brokerage, said by phone today.  Net income for the nine months through September more than
doubled, climbing to 9.63 billion naira ($61 million), from 3.83
billion naira a year earlier, UAC said on Oct. 31. Second-
quarter profit increased more than threefold to 7.8 billion
naira, from 2.2 billion naira a year earlier, it said on Aug. 2.  The second-quarter profit included 5.5 billion naira earned
from the sale of a 49 percent stake in UAC’s food division to
 Tiger Brands Ltd. (TBS)  of  South Africa , Securities Africa Ltd., a
Johannesburg-based brokerage, said at the time.  “Perhaps the company plans to distribute that to
shareholders,” Adonri said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
