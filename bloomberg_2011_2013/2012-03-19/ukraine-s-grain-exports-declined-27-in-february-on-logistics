Ukraine’s grain exports fell 27
percent in February to 1.63 million metric tons compared with
the previous month, due to seasonal factors and logistical
problems, UkrAgroConsult said, citing preliminary information.  In February, corn shipments accounted for 1.21 million
tons, wheat shipments 388,000 tons and barley 9,800 tons, the
Kiev-based agricultural researcher said in an e-mailed statement
today. It didn’t provide further details about the reasons for
the decline.  Ukraine exported 2.24 million tons of grain in January, the
researcher said. March exports aren’t expected to fall below
February’s shipment level.  To contact the reporters on this story:
