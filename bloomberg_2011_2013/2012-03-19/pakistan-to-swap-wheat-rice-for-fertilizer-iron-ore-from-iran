Pakistan  may export 1 million
metric tons of wheat to  Iran  in return for fertilizer and iron
ore, said Tanveer Alam, a public relations officer at the
Ministry of Water and Power.  A delegation of government officials will visit Iran by
next week to work out details of the barter trade, which may
include Pakistan supplying 200,000 tons of rice, he said by
phone from Islamabad. “Once back, the delegation will submit a
report to the cabinet, which will then approve the deal.”  Pakistan, Asia’s third-largest grower of wheat, may produce
as much 25 million tons this year, the Ministry of National Food
Security & Research said in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
