Tufts University  and  Northwestern
University  are taking advantage of investor demand for higher-
education debt after the University of California sold the
largest college century bonds last month.  Tufts,  named  after Boston businessman Charles Tufts and
chartered in 1852, may sell $250 million taxable 100-year bonds
as soon as today, said a person with knowledge of the offering.
Northwestern, which includes Orrington Lunt, a founder of the
Chicago Board of Trade, among its forefathers, may issue $150
million of 35-year notes on March 21, said the person, who
declined to be identified because terms aren’t set.  The world’s wealthiest educational institutions, which
typically sell tax-free bonds in the municipal market, have
tapped demand for higher-rated taxable corporate debt in the
past year.  Massachusetts  Institute of Technology and California
Institute of Technology are among five colleges that sold $2.7
billion of 100-year debt in the past nine months, the biggest
surge in 26 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The universe of “high-quality double- and triple-A names
is shrinking,” making the debt from the institutions more
appealing, Timothy Cox, executive director of debt capital
markets at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in New York, said in a
telephone interview. The universities may also be trying to
“diversify” their investor base, he said.  Diversifying Investors  Tufts’ bonds may be rated Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service
and AA- by  Standard & Poor’s , according to the person with
knowledge of the offering. Northwestern’s may be graded Aaa by
Moody’s and AAA by S&P. There are 62 issues in Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s AAA index, compared with 120 in 2007. In the
bank’s AA graded index, the number of issues has fallen to 403
from 516 five years ago.  Tufts, based in Somerville, Massachusetts, doesn’t have any
corporate bonds outstanding, while Evanston, Illinois-based
Northwestern sold $5.3 million of taxable debt with a variable
 interest rate  in September 2007, Bloomberg data show.  The  University of California  sold $860 million of 4.8
percent taxable debt that pays 4.86 percent yearly last month,
Bloomberg data show.  MIT’s $750 million issue of 5.6 percent debentures last May
was the first of 100-year bonds by a college since $100 million
by  Boston University  in 1997. The University of  Southern
California  followed last year with $300 million at 5.25 percent,
Ohio State University sold $500 million at 4.8 percent and the
California Institute of Technology issued $350 million at 4.7
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yields on investment-grade corporate debt fell to a record
3.40 percent on March 2 before rising to 3.55 percent on March
16, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The
rate for 30-year tax-exempt  municipal debt  with an AAA grade is
3.49 percent, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
