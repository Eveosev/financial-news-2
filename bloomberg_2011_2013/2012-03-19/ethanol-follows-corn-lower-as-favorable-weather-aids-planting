Ethanol futures followed corn lower
on speculation that favorable weather will aid planting.  Prices fell after Newedge USA predicted the amount of land
dedicated to the grain would rise to 93.7 million acres, up from
91.9 million. Corn is the primary ingredient in ethanol made in
the U.S., with one bushel making at least 2.75 gallons of the
fuel alternative.  “Ethanol was definitely leaning lower because of corn,”
said  Dan Flynn , a trader at PFG Best in Chicago. “I’m hearing
about a lot of planting.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery fell 1.9 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.336 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade, only
the fifth time the additive has dropped this month. Prices have
risen 6 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago gained 1.5
cents, or 0.7 percent, to $2.30 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive declined 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.36, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf slipped 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $2.31 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel slumped 5
cents, or 2 percent, to $2.405.  Corn for May delivery sank 9.5 cents, or 1.4 percent, to
$6.635 a bushel in  Chicago .  Distillers are losing 7 cents per gallon of ethanol based
on current prices for corn and the biofuel, assuming a bushel of
corn generates 2.75 gallons of ethanol, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
