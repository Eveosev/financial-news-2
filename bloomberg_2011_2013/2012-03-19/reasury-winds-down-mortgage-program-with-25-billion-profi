The U.S. Treasury Department said
today it has wrapped up its mortgage bond program with a $25
billion profit.  The profit comes as the Treasury has been working to exit
from its 2008 rescue programs, including the Troubled Asset
Relief Program.  The Treasury sold its $250 billion in agency guaranteed
mortgage-backed securities from  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac , the
department said. The Treasury bought the bonds in 2008 and 2009,
it said in a statement.  “The successful sale of these securities marks another
important milestone in the wind down of the government’s
emergency financial crisis response efforts,” Treasury
assistant secretary for financial markets  Mary Miller  said in
the release. “This program helped support the housing market
during a critical moment for our nation’s economy and delivered
a substantial profit for taxpayers.”  The Treasury purchased $225 billion in government-
sponsored-enterprise bonds and made a profit of $25 billion from
principal, interest and the sale. Treasury announced in March
2011 it would begin winding down the program through sales of as
much as $10 billion of bonds a month.  The Obama administration has highlighted the performance of
the TARP bank program, which has returned about $259 billion,
more than the $245 billion lenders received. There are 361 banks
still remaining in TARP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
