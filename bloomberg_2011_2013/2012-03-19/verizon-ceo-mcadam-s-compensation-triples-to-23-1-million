Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)  Chief
Executive Officer Lowell McAdam’s total compensation more than
tripled to $23.1 million after the company’s shares rose 11
percent since his promotion from chief operating officer.  Wireless growth and a jump in the share price since his
appointment on Aug. 1, helped push McAdam’s salary to $1.4
million from $913,462 in 2010, when he was COO. McAdam’s stock
options more than quadrupled to $18.8 million in 2011, Verizon
said in a regulatory filing today.  Shares of New York-based Verizon, the nation’s second-
largest phone company, which co-owns the largest U.S. wireless
carrier Verizon Wireless with  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , gained 12
percent in 2011.  McAdam replaced Ivan Seidenberg the former chairman and
chief executive officer who retired last year. Seidenberg’s
total compensation for 2011 was $26.5 million, which included a
base salary of $2.1 million and stock awards of $19.5 million.
In 2010, Seidenberg’s total pay was $31.9 million, according to
the filing.  Verizon rose 0.2 percent to $39.65 at the close in  New
York .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
