Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. (2330) , the world’s largest contract maker of chips, rose to a
record in Taipei trading after saying it will probably boost
spending amid growing demand for advanced technologies.  TSMC  climbed  3 percent to NT$83.50, the highest since the
shares were listed in 1994, as of 1:24 p.m.  Taiwan ’s benchmark
Taiex index fell 0.2 percent.  “It is likely that it will be raised, but we can’t confirm
until April 26” when the company’s quarterly investor
conference will be held, Elizabeth Sun, a spokeswoman for the
Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company, said by phone today, without
commenting on the size of the increase.  TSMC’s most advanced production, using 28-nanometer
technology, is fully booked, driven by demand for graphics and
mobile chips, Credit Suisse Group AG wrote in a report today.
The chipmaker may raise its spending budget to $6.8 billion from
the $6 billion it forecast in January, the Economic Daily News
reported today, citing foreign investors it didn’t identify.  “We are seeing a sharper loading increase at TSMC,” Randy Abrams, a Taipei-based analyst at Credit Suisse, wrote. He
raised his second-quarter sales estimate to NT$105 billion ($3.6
billion) from NT$98 billion and his full-year forecast for
 capital spending  to $7 billion from $6 billion.  Abrams also raised his 12-month share-price estimate for
TSMC to NT$90 from NT$79 while maintaining a rating of
outperform on the stock.  TSMC’s Taipei-listed shares have 26 buy and six hold
 recommendations  from 32 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, with
none suggesting investors sell the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
