Argentine trucks carrying grains to
ports on the Parana River declined by 72 percent compared with a
year earlier amid a strike,  data  from the Rosario Cereals
Exchange showed.  Only 1,674 trucks arrived at grain ports in  Argentina ’s
Santa Fe province as of this morning, compared with 5,901 a year
ago, the exchange said in a daily report on its  website  today.
Arrivals were 43 percent down from March 16.  The truckers strike threatens to further disrupt shipments
from Argentina, the world’s second-largest corn exporter, after
dockworkers ceased activity earlier this month over work hours.  Truck arrivals are down 12 percent so far this year
compared with the same period in 2011 at ports on the Parana
River that handle more than 80 percent of the country’s exports.
Argentina is the world’s third-largest soybean exporter behind
the U.S. and  Brazil . The U.S. is also the world’s largest corn
exporter.  Truckers began an indefinite strike today as they seek an
increase in tariffs and faster payments from their customers,
newspaper Cronista said, citing union leaders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
