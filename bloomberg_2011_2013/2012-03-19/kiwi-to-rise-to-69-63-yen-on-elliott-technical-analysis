New Zealand ’s dollar may climb to
69.63 yen, its highest level in almost 2 1/2 years, Forecast Pte
said, citing trading patterns.  The advance in the South Pacific currency, nicknamed the
kiwi, from its low of 57.03 yen on Nov. 24 “looks like a five-
wave move,” said Pak Lai Ng, a technical analyst at Forecast,
referring to the so-called Elliott Wave Theory, which says
market swings follow a predictable five-stage structure.  “The kiwi has been very bullish,” Singapore-based Ng
said. “The 2010 and 2009 highs coincide with the projection for
69.63. There is strong resistance in this area.” Resistance is
a level where sell orders may be clustered.  New Zealand’s dollar traded at 68.92 yen as of 11:02 a.m.
Wellington time from 68.87 yesterday, when it rose to 69.14, the
highest since May 2010. It last touched 69.63 yen on Oct. 23,
2009, when it strengthened to 69.74. The currency approached the
level again on May 4, 2010, when it gained to 69.37 yen.  The kiwi rallied from its November low to 61.12 yen on Dec.
2, the first wave in the Elliott cycle, Ng said. Its drop to
58.26 on Dec. 15 was the second wave, while its rebound to 68.35
yen on Feb. 27 was the third. The currency dropped to 65.31 yen
on March 6, completing the fourth wave.  The  Elliott Wave Principle , proposed by accountant Ralph
Elliott in the 1930s, is based on the theory that investor
psychology moves between optimism and pessimism in natural
sequences. It seeks to predict prices by dividing past trends
into five sections, or waves.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
