The U.S. is studying the
vulnerability of Colonial Pipeline Co. and  Kinder Morgan Energy
Partners LP (KMP)  pipelines that carry fuel from  Gulf of Mexico 
refineries to the East Coast, the U.S. Homeland Security
Department said today.  “We will be conducting analysis to better understand how
disruptions to Colonial’s pipeline and Plantation pipelines
could affect the broader critical infrastructure,” said Brandon
Wales, director of the department’s Homeland Infrastructure
Threat and Risk Analysis Center.  Wales was responding to lawmaker questions about the risk
of terrorist attacks to energy assets during a hearing webcast
by a U.S. House Homeland Security Committee panel from Aston,
Pennsylvania, today.  The agency has conducted more than 60 vulnerability
assessments for U.S. pipeline infrastructure in the past several
years, Wales said.  “Our primary concern would be a prolonged damage to the
pipeline that kept it down more than a week, more than two
weeks,” said Wales. “Once you start getting beyond a week or
two the ability for the excess inventory at terminals along its
route starts to be diminished and then you start to have more
serious impacts.”  Sunoco, ConocoPhillips  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) , which owns three plants on the U.S. East Coast
and announced plans to exit refining in September, lost $1.68
billion in 2011 as the profit margin for turning oil into fuel
shrunk to the lowest point since 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sunoco announced Dec. 1 the immediate idling of the
194,000-barrel-a-day Marcus Hook refinery in Pennsylvania. The
company will decide by July whether to halt production at its
355,000-barrel-a-day Philadelphia refinery.  ConocoPhillips (COP) 
stopped processing crude at the 190,000-barrel-a-day Trainer,
Pennsylvania, plant on Sept. 30.  Colonial operates 5,500 miles of pipeline delivering
gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products from  Gulf
Coast  refineries to markets across the U.S. South and East
Coast.  Kinder Morgan  operates more than 8,000 miles of pipelines
across the U.S., including the 3,100-mile Plantation system
delivering petroleum products from the Gulf Coast to states in
the southeast U.S. and along the East coast.  To contact the reporters on this story:
