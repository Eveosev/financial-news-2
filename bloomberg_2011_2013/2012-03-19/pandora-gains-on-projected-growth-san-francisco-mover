Pandora Media Inc. , the Internet
radio pioneer, gained on new coverage highlighting the music
site’s potential to add listeners and capture advertising
dollars.  Pandora, based in Oakland,  California , rose 2.7 percent to
$10.60 at 3:47 p.m. in  New York , after climbing as much as 4.7
percent earlier. Investors purchased calls, bets the stock will
rise from current levels, at 6.5 times the rate of puts.  Today’s gain lifts  Pandora (P)  off of an 11-week low hit March
16 in the wake of fiscal first-quarter results that missed
analysts’ projections on March 6. John Blackledge, an analyst
with Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, initiated coverage
today with a neutral rating and $12 target price, suggesting the
company will build subscribers and revenue as it sells ads.  “We expect continued usage growth and improving
monetization to yield strong top-line growth,” offset by high
content costs, Blackledge wrote in his note to clients. “We
believe usage trends and revenue growth are factored in at
current levels.”  Pandora has about 70 percent of the Internet radio market
in the U.S., according to Triton Digital, with more than 125
million registered users and more than 49 million active users.
That’s up from 24 million last year, according to the Credit
Suisse note.  Demand for Calls  Blackledge expects Pandora to increase its share of the ad-
supported music market to 7.7 percent by 2016, from 1.45 percent
in 2011, he wrote. Content costs will rise to 54 percent of
revenue this year and 60 percent in 2013, from 50 percent in
2011, he wrote, citing “explosive growth in listening hours.”  More than 8,100 calls to buy Pandora’s stock changed hands
as of 3:42 p.m. in New York, 1.4 times the four-week average and
6.5 times the number of puts to sell. April $11 and $12 calls
were the most active.  While more than 70 percent of Pandora’s listening is via
mobile devices, only about 50 percent of its advertising revenue
is mobile. The remainder comes from PC-based online listening,
according to Blackledge.  The company is hiring staff to increase its sales presence
in large U.S. radio markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
