Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (ST) ,
 Southeast Asia ’s biggest phone company, hired Lim Cheng Cheng,
the former chief financial officer of SMRT Corp., this month to
manage its investment portfolio.  Lim started at SingTel on March 7 and reports to Group
Chief Strategy Officer Bradley Gambill, the company said in an
e-mailed response to questions. Lim, who resigned as SMRT’s CFO
in March last year, will manage SingTel’s investment portfolio
“through the execution of acquisitions and divestments.”  SingTel agreed to buy Redwood, California-based Amobee Inc.
for $321 million in cash this month to expand in mobile
advertising amid a surge in demand for smartphones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
