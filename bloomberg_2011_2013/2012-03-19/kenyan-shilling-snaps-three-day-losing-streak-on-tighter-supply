Kenya ’s shilling gained, snapping a
three-day losing streak on tighter  money supply .  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.9 percent and traded 0.7 percent stronger at 82.53
by 4:07 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital.  “The shilling has gained on account of tight liquidity in
the money market,” leading to dollar sales by traders and
banks, Duncan Kinuthia, a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial
Bank of Africa Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Money-market liquidity tightened due to continued
remittances of taxes to government, build-up of reserves by
commercial banks to meet the monthly cash reserve requirement
and increased net government borrowing through Treasury bills,
the central bank said in its weekly bulletin dated March 16. The
average  interbank rate  increased to 26.04 percent last week from
23.08 percent the previous week, it said.  Tanzania’s shilling rose by less than 0.1 percent to 1,593
per dollar. The Ugandan shilling declined as much as 0.4 percent
to 2,491 per dollar and traded 0.2 percent weaker at 2,485 per
dollar.  -- With assistance from David Malingha Doya in  Dar es Salaam .
