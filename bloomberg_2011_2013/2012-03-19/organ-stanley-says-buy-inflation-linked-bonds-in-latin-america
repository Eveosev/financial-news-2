Morgan Stanley recommended its
clients buy bonds linked to consumer prices in  Brazil , Mexico
and Chile on a bet that an economic recovery in  Latin America 
will spur inflation.  Investors should buy two-year inflation-linked bonds and
pay fixed interest-rate swap rates with similar maturities,
analysts led by New York-based Vitali Meschoulam wrote in a
note. The yield difference between the two securities, which
reflects expectations of the average annual consumer price
increases over the next two years, will rise more than 50 basis
points, or 0.5 percentage point, in Mexico and Chile, the
analysts wrote. The so-called break-even rate may increase 33
basis points to 6.2 percent in Brazil, according to the note.  “With euro area tail risks being priced out of markets and
geopolitical developments putting pressure on  oil prices , we
highlight the potential for markets to again focus on
deteriorating inflation,” the analysts wrote. “We are likely
to see a bottoming out of inflation near end of the second
quarter before inflation starts rising again.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
