Cyprus’s government supports
purchases of its bonds on the secondary market by the  European
Central Bank , government spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou  said.  Outgoing Finance Minister Kikis Kazamias “has sent a
letter on this issue” to the ECB, Stefanou told reporters in
Nicosia today. “We definitely want this kind of support which
other countries enjoy.”  The eastern Mediterranean island, the euro area’s third-
smallest economy, was shut out of markets in May as borrowing
costs rose amid investor concern that the government may have to
support banks facing losses on their Greek holdings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
