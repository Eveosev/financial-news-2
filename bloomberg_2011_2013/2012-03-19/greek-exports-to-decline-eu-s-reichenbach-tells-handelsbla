Greece ’s exports will probably
decline this year compared to 2011, Horst Reichenbach, the
European Union official in charge of aiding the country’s
administrative overhaul, was quoted as saying by Handelsblatt.  Reichenbach said Greek exports reveresed their positive
trend in November and probably won’t be as dynamic in 2012 as
last year, according to an interview with Reichenbach in the
Dusseldorf, Germany-based newspaper today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
