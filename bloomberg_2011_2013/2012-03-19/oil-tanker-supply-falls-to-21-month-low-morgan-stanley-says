The  supply  of  oil tankers  seeking
to haul Persian Gulf crude fell to a 21-month low on demand in
 China  and possible disruptions of Iranian exports, Morgan
Stanley analyst Fotis Giannakoulis said.  Oil companies booked a “surprising high” of 42 very large
crude carriers, or VLCCs, to ship crude to China in the past two
weeks, Giannakoulis wrote in an e-mailed report today. U.S.
refineries on the  Gulf of Mexico  are also accelerating purchases
of  Saudi Arabian (OPCRSAUD)  crude after the world’s largest exporter
widened price discounts, he said.  The reduced vessel supply is “mainly driven by
geopolitical uncertainties over Iranian production and the surge
in eastbound demand,” he said, adding that the number of ships
seeking cargo is the lowest since June 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
