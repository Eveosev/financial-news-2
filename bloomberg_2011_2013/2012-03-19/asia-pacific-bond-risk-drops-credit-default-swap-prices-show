The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index tumbled 5 basis points to
126 basis points as of 10:41 a.m. in Sydney, according to
 National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  The gauge is set for its lowest
level since Aug. 3, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 3 basis points to 132 as of 8:30
a.m. in  Hong Kong , set for the lowest close since Aug. 5, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 3 basis points to 137.5
as of 9:14 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG prices show. Thatâ€™s
set for the lowest close since Feb. 24., when it touched a six-
month low, according to CMA prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
