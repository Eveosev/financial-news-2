The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
advanced to the highest level since May 2008 as Apple Inc. plans
to pay a dividend and buy back $10 billion of its stock.  Apple climbed 2.7 percent to a record $601.10.  Citigroup (C) 
Inc. advanced 1.3 percent after selling its 2.71 percent stake
in Shanghai Pudong Development Bank.  U.S. Steel (X)  Corp. rallied
6.4 percent to pace gains in commodity shares.  United Parcel
Service Inc. (UPS)  increased 3.4 percent after agreeing to buy TNT
Express NV.  Bank of America Corp.  retreated 2.8 percent,
reversing an earlier advance that drove the stock above $10.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.4 percent to 1,409.75 at 4 p.m. New York
time, trading 9.9 percent below its October 2007 record of
1,565.15. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 6.51 points, or
0.1 percent, to 13,239.13. The  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  gained 0.8
percent to 3,078.32, the highest level since November 2000. The
 S&P Smallcap 600 Index (SML)  increased 0.9 percent to an all-time high
of 465.97. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S.
exchanges, almost in line with its three-month average.  “There’s plenty of room for dividends to increase,” said
Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of  asset allocation  for ING
Investment Management. His firm oversees $160 billion. “Paying
dividends is a sign of health in the companies and the economy.
That plays well in terms of investors’ confidence.”  The S&P 500 has rallied 12 percent this year and is on pace
for the best first quarter since 1998 amid better-than-estimated
economic and corporate reports. It trades at about  14.6 times 
reported earnings, the highest valuation level since July while
still below the average since 1954 of 16.4 times earnings.  Apple, Banks  Today’s rally amid  Apple (AAPL) ’s announcement added to last
week’s optimism over dividend increases by banks including
JPMorgan Chase & Co. The index rose 2.4 percent between March 9
and March 16 for the biggest weekly gain this year.  “It’s all about confidence,” said  James Paulsen , who
helps oversee about $333 billion as chief investment strategist
at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital Management. “You’re seeing
more evidence of corporate confidence rising to the extent that
companies are starting to act on that. The environment for the
next few years still looks very good for equity investors.”  Apple gained 2.7 percent to $601.10. Investors will receive
a quarterly dividend of $2.65 a share starting in the period
beginning July 1, Cupertino, California-based Apple said in a
statement. The buybacks will begin in the fiscal year starting
Sept. 30 and will take place over three years, the company said.  The company’s  cash pile  has swelled amid surging demand for
its products. Investors had urged Apple to return some of the
balance in the form a dividend.  ‘Extremely Confident’  “We are extremely confident in our future and see
tremendous opportunities ahead,” Apple Chief Financial Officer
 Peter Oppenheimer  said in the release. He said the company plans
to pay out about $45 billion over three years.  The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  added 0.5 percent as 20 of its 24 stocks
advanced. Bank of America fell 2.8 percent to $9.53, snapping a
four-day rally.  Citigroup added 1.3 percent to $37.17. The third-largest
U.S. bank sold its 2.71 percent stake in Shanghai Pudong
Development Bank to institutional investors, generating after-
tax proceeds of about $349 million.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  rallied 2.7 percent to $20.06. The owner of
the world’s largest brokerage is planning its first corporate
bond sale since October after the cost to protect its bonds from
default dropped by almost 50 percent in the past four months.  U.S. Steel had the biggest advance in the S&P 500, gaining
6.4 percent to $31.64. The country’s largest producer of the
metal by volume should benefit from a recovery in steel prices,
UBS AG said in a note.  Biggest Deal  UPS added 3.4 percent to $81.11, the highest level since
July 2006. The company raised its offer for TNT Express NV by
5.6 percent to 5.16 billion euros ($6.8 billion) to secure the
 biggest deal  in the U.S. company’s 105-year history.  E*Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC)  advanced 1.6 percent to $11.22. The
online brokerage was raised to the equivalent of buy at Wells
Fargo & Co.  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)  slumped 4.5 percent, the most in the
S&P 500, to $2.76. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. downgraded the
company amid concern it won’t sell enough iPhones to afford its
“punishing” commitment with Apple Inc.  Medco Health Solutions Inc. (MHS)  lost 1.9 percent to $68.93.
 Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) ’s bid to acquire the company may be delayed
by a lawsuit being considered by five states.  Express Scripts 
fell 2.1 percent to $53.22.  Homebuilders Drop  A measure of homebuilders in S&P indexes dropped 0.9
percent. The March reading of 28 in the National Association of
Home Builders/Wells Fargo  index  of builder confidence was less
than projected and followed a February figure that was lower
than initially reported, figures from the Washington-based group
showed today. The  median  forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a rise to 30. Readings below 50 mean
more respondents said conditions were poor.  KB Home (KBH)  sank 6.8 percent to $11.89. PulteGroup Inc.
retreated 1.4 percent to $9.16.  Daily price changes in the S&P 500 are decreasing the most
in eight decades, shrinking to the smallest since 1995 when
investors abandoned stocks just before the biggest rally ever.  The  benchmark gauge  for U.S. equities has gained or lost an
average 0.46 percent a day this year, compared with 1.04 percent
 in 2011 , the biggest reduction since 1934, during the Great
Depression, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Swings are
diminishing after  valuations  fell 40 percent and correlation
among shares weakened the most in at least three decades.  Lowest in 13 Years  At the same time, trading on the New York Stock Exchange
has slumped to  the lowest rate  in 13 years, spurring concern
about the biggest first-quarter rally since 1998. Bulls say the
decline in trading and daily swings signal fear is dissipating
after one of the most volatile years on record. Bears say
falling volume is a warning gains will reverse should economic
reports and earnings fail to match expectations.  “Low volatility is good in that it will bring investors
back,” Tim Hoyle, the director of research at Radnor,
Pennsylvania-based Haverford Trust Co., which manages $6
billion, said in a March 13 phone interview. “Even though
bullish sentiment is high, people are still fearful. I see it in
my business every day, they couldn’t stomach the volatility.
This will restore some sense.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
