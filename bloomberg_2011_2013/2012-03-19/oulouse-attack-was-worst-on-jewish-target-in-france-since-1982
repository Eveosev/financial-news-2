Following are the worst attacks on
 France ’s Jewish community in recent decades. The Jewish
population in France numbers about 550,000, or about 0.9 percent
of the total, according to the  Conseil Représentatif des
Institutions Juives de France , the country’s main Jewish Group.
France has the biggest Jewish community in  Europe .  -- Today: Four people were killed, including three
children, and one seriously injured in a shooting outside a
Jewish school in a residential neighborhood of the southwestern
city of Toulouse. The murderer is on the run and no claim was
made for the killing.  -- February 13, 2006: Ilan Halimi, 23 years old,, was found
naked and dying with marks of torture on his body. Halimi, a
salesman in a Paris telephone store, had been kidnapped on Jan.
21. Police found him in the southern Paris suburb of Sainte-
Genevieve-Des-Bois more than three weeks later. Youssef Fofana,
who led the group of assailants, was sentenced to  life
imprisonment .  -- November 15, 2003: a wing of the Merkaz Hatorah School
in Gagny, near Paris, was destroyed in an arson attack. No one
was killed or injured. Former President  Jacques Chirac  said “an
attack on a Jew is an attack against France.”  -- August 9, 1982: “Chez Jo Goldenberg” restaurant and
deli was bombed at lunchtime, killing six, including two
American tourists from the Chicago area, and wounding 22 people.
This attack was the deadliest aimed at Jews in France since
World War II. No arrests were made nor was there ever a claim of
responsibility.  -- October 3, 1980: The synagogue Union Liberale Israelite
de France on rue Copernic in Paris was bombed by a group of
unidentified terrorists on Sabbath day, killing four and
injuring 46. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-
Special Operations (PFLP-SO) claimed responsibility.  -- In the past 20 years, several hundred Jewish tombstones
have been desecrated in France at cemeteries in Carpentras in
1990, in Herrilsheim in 1992, in Brumath in 2004, in Bar-Le-Duc
in 2010.  According to CRIF, there is no record of anti-Semitic
murders in France between the end of World War II and 1980.  The French  Interior Ministry  said there were 389 anti-
Semitic threats and acts in France in 2011, fewer than the 466
in 2010. The number of violence acts remained unchanged with 129
last year versus 131 in 2010, the ministry told Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
