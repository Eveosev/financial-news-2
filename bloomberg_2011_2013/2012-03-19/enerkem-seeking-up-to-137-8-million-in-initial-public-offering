Enerkem Inc. (NRKM) , the Montreal-based
developer of biofuels from municipal waste, is seeking as much
as $137.8 million in an initial public offering.  The company is offering 7.25 million shares at $17 to $19
apiece, according to a regulatory filing  today . The stock will
list on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol NRKM and on the
Toronto Stock Exchange under NKM.  Enerkem plans to use the proceeds from the IPO to build a
commercial facility that makes ethanol in Edmonton, Alberta, and
to fund other sites in the U.S. and  Canada . Enerkemâ€™s loss more
than doubled to C$26.2 million ($26.4 million) in 2011 from a
year earlier, the filing shows.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and  Bank
of Montreal (BMO)  are leading the IPO. Rho Ventures LLC will hold 29
percent of the company after the offering, while Braemar Energy
Ventures will hold 16 percent and Waste Management Inc. will own
8.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
