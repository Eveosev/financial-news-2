Lithuania ’s current three-party
ruling coalition may be dissolved, leaving the government with a
minority in parliament and raising the possibility of early
elections.  Coalition partners the Homeland Union and the Liberal
Center Union “no longer speak the same language,” Eligijus Masiulis, head of the Liberal Movement, said during the  Lietuvos
Rytas  television program late last night. Working in a minority
government until the next elections in October “would be the
best solution,” Masiulis, who is also transportation minister,
said.  Tensions between Homeland Union, led by Prime Minister
Andrius Kubilius, and the Liberal Center Union grew after
Internal Affairs Minister Raimundas Palaitis refused to resign
and got President Dalia Grybauskaite’s backing after the prime
minister requested the minister’s dismissal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
