Humpuss Sea Transport Pte Ltd., a
Singapore-based unit of an Indonesian shipping company, filed
for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in the U.S.  The unit of Jakarta-based PT  Humpuss Intermoda Transportasi (HITS) 
is already under the control of liquidators in  Singapore , where
it was incorporated in 1996, according to today’s filing in  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court  in Manhattan. Debt and assets were listed at
more than $100 million.  “Following the global financial crisis in 2008, shipping
rates (HST’s primary source of revenue) sharply decreased,”
Jason Aleksander Kardachi, a liquidator for the company in
Singapore, said in court papers.  Proceedings against Humpuss Sea to make required payments
under charter agreements led to judgments totaling as much as
$100 million, according to court papers. Company records from
2009 indicate assets of $182 million, Kardachi said.  Under Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code, foreign companies
can block U.S. lawsuits and organize U.S. creditors to assist
their reorganization in a foreign court. Humpuss Sea is a
defendant in a lawsuit in  New York  and liquidators in Singapore
may need help from U.S. parties to recover assets, lawyers for
the company wrote.  Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP (1197L)  is representing the company
in its Chapter 15 bankruptcy, according to court papers  Shipping companies that have filed for bankruptcy in recent
years include General Maritime Corp.,  Korea Line Corp. (005880) ,
Britannia Bulk Plc, Armada (Singapore) Pte Ltd. and Transfield
ER Cape.  The case is In re Humpuss Sea Transport PTE Ltd. 12-11086,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
