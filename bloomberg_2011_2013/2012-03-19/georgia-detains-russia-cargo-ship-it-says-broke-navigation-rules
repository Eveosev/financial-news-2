Georgia ’s coast guard detained a
Russian cargo ship in the  Black Sea , saying the vessel had
violated navigation rules.  The Pur-Navolok was stopped in the Sarpi Sea region near
the Turkish border, Georgia’s Border Police said today in a
statement on its website. As many as 10 crew members, all
Russian citizens, are being held, according to the statement.  Georgia lost a five-day war against Russia in 2008 over the
breakaway republic of South Ossetia. Russia later recognized the
region and Abkhazia, another separatist republic, as
independent. Georgia still deems them part of its territory.  To contact the reporters on this story:
