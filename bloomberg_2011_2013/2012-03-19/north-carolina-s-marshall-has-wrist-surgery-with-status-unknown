University of North Carolina 
sophomore guard Kendall Marshall had surgery this morning to
repair a broken bone in his right wrist. His status for the rest
of the national men’s college basketball tournament hasn’t been
determined.  Marshall, 20, is out of surgery and the Tar Heels have no
announcement yet regarding his availability, athletic department
spokesman Steve Kirschner said in an e-mail. The top seed in the
Midwest Region of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament, the Tar Heels play No. 13-seed  Ohio University  in
the regional semifinals on March 23 at  St. Louis .  Marshall, who set school and  Atlantic Coast Conference 
records with 340 assists this season, broke the scaphoid bone in
his non-shooting wrist in the second half of the Tar Heels’ 87-
73 victory yesterday over  Creighton University . He has averaged
14.8 points and 10.3 assists per game in his last six contests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
