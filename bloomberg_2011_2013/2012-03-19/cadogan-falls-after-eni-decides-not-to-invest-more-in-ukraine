Cadogan Petroleum Plc (CAD) , a London-
listed oil and gas explorer in Ukraine, fell to the lowest since
January after  Eni SpA (ENI)  decided not to invest more in a project in
the eastern European country.  Cadogan slid 7.8 percent to 25.25 pence, the lowest since
Jan. 16, as of the market close. After results from two wells,
the company said today that Eni won’t exercise its option to buy
an additional 30 percent in Pokroskvoe Petroleum BV.  Explorers are looking for oil and gas in Ukraine to lessen
Europe’s dependence on Russia for energy. Cadogan has interests
in license areas covering 14 fields in Ukraine.  Drilling became stuck in an attempt to extend one of the
wells after it uncovered the presence of hydrocarbons, the
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
