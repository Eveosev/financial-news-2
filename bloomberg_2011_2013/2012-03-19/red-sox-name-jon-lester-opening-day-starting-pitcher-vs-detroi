Boston  Red Sox  left-hander Jon
Lester will be the team’s opening day starting pitcher against
the Detroit Tigers on April 5, the second year in a row he had
the honor.  Lester, a two-time All-Star, will face 2011 American League
Cy Young Award winner and Most Valuable Player Justin Verlander
in the 1:05 p.m. game at Comerica Park in Detroit, the team said
in a statement.  The Red Sox lost last year’s opening-day game against the
 Texas Rangers . Lester, 28, has a 76-34 record over six major-
league seasons, all with Boston.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
