The U.S. tax credit for wind power,
due to end Dec. 31, should be extended to spur new projects,  BP
Plc (BP/) ’s BP Alternative Energy Chief Executive Officer Katrina Landis.  Landis said that wind-power developers are putting U.S.
projects on hold while waiting to see if Congress approves an
extension of the Production Tax Credit, which provides 2.2 cents
a kilowatt-hour for electricity generated from wind.  “We’ve been hearing from wind-turbine manufacturers that
they have no orders for 2013,” Landis said in an interview at
the  Bloomberg New Energy Finance Summit  in New York today.
“They are shifting to places like  Brazil , where there is more
certainty about support.”  If the credit is allowed to lapse, installations of
turbines in the U.S. may fall as much as 95 percent to 500
megawatts in 2013 from this year, Amy Grace, a New Energy
Finance wind analyst, said at the event.  “The PTC is an incentive that is genuinely working,”
Landis said. “Having transparent incentives that step down over
time is the right approach.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
