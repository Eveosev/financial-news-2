Polish industrial-output growth
slowed in February, suggesting the European Union’s biggest
eastern economy is weakening as its trading partners in the
bloc’s west grapple with a debt crisis.  Production (POISCYOY)  rose 4.6 percent from a year earlier after
increasing 9 percent in January, the Central Statistical office
in Warsaw said today. That compares with the 8.8 percent median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 24 economists. Output dropped
1 percent on the month.  Poland’s economy will expand 2.5 percent this year after
growing 4.3 percent in 2011, the government forecasts.  Job
growth (POEYYOY)  at companies with more than nine workers slowed for a
seventh month in eight in February, while the purchasing
managers’ index, a gauge of manufacturing, fell to 50 from 52.2
amid weaker demand for exports, more than half of which go to
the euro region.  “We’re seeing lower output growth in part because of the
slowdown in our neighbors,”  Grzegorz Maliszewski , chief
economist at Bank Millennium SA in Warsaw, said by phone before
the release. “Although Poland has been fairly resilient to the
global slowdown, it has an effect on us too.”  Producer prices  rose 6.3 percent from a year earlier,
slowed from a revised 7.9 percent advance in January, the
statistics office said in a separate report. That’s below the
6.6 percent median forecast of 20 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Producer prices fell 0.3 percent from January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
