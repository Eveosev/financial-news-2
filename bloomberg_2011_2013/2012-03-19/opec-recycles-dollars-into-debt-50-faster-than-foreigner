OPEC nations are plowing cash into
U.S. Treasuries at a more than 50 percent faster rate than all
other foreign investors, an unintended benefit of  oil prices 
above $100 a barrel.  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Country members boosted
their  net purchases  of government debt by $43.3 billion, or 20
percent, in the 12 months ended Jan. 31, compared with a 13
percent increase for non-OPEC foreign holdings, Treasury
Department data showed last week. With prices up $26 a barrel
since Sept. 30, producers have an additional $780 million in
profits every day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  International investors, which own about  $5 trillion , or
half of the marketable U.S. government debt outstanding, are key
to President Barack Obama’s administration financing a  budget
deficit  forecast to exceed $1 trillion for a fourth year. OPEC’s
purchases may help temper a plunge in Treasuries after yields
surged last week by the most since January 2009 amid gains in
jobs, retail sales, and manufacturing.  “With the price of oil hovering around triple digits the
profits have to go somewhere,” said  Kevin Flanagan , the
Purchase, New York-based chief fixed-income strategist at Morgan
Stanley Smith Barney, the world’s largest brokerage, with assets
of $1.78 trillion. “You don’t hear about dollar diversification
anymore. The only game in town is the dollar, and if you are
sitting on dollars it only makes sense to buy Treasuries,” he
said in a March 13 telephone interview.  Higher Yields  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose 27 basis
points, or 0.27 percentage point, to 2.30 percent last week,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The increase was the
most since yields jumped 32 basis points in the five days ended
July 1. The 2 percent note due February 2022 fell 2 11/32, or
$23.44 per $1,000 face amount, to 97 12/32.  The yield rose eight basis points to 2.37 percent at 2:57
p.m. in New York.  The OPEC nations --  Algeria , Angola, Ecuador,  Iran ,  Iraq ,
Kuwait,  Libya ,  Nigeria , Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela -- provide about 44 percent of the
world’s oil. They will earn $1.105 trillion in 2012, up from an
estimated $1.01 trillion last year, which was a 30 percent
increase from $778 billion in 2010, the government’s Energy
Information Administration in  Washington  said.  They held $258.8 billion of the $10.428 trillion of
Treasuries outstanding as of Jan. 31, up from $215.5 billion a
year earlier and $211.9 billion in January 2010, Treasury
Department data show.  Rising Reserves  Thanks to booming profits, the currency reserves of oil
exporting nations have grown by $73 billion since January to
more than $400 billion, creating more dollars to buy U.S. bonds,
according to a Bank of America Corp. report last week.  United Arab Emirates central bank governor Sultan Nasser al-Suwaidi told reporters in  Abu Dhabi  on Nov. 29 that the
country was resuming investing in Treasuries, after saying in
July it didn’t hold them because of “very low” returns.  Saudi
Arabia  owned a record $350 billion in foreign securities as of
June 30, central bank data show. HSBC Holdings Plc estimates a
“large proportion” of those investments are in Treasuries.  Oil-exporters’ higher purchases come amid slowing demand
from  China (HOLDCH) , the largest foreign U.S. creditor, which boosted its
investment by 0.42 percent in the 12 months ended Jan. 31 to
$1.16 trillion, the smallest increase over the same period on
record. The world’s second-largest economy’s holdings fell from
a high of $1.31 trillion in July, Treasury data show.  ‘Both Hands’  “The boost in purchases from OPEC nations has been a
welcome development to the Treasury Department,”  Eric Lascelles , the chief economist at Toronto-based Royal Bank of
Canada Global Asset Management, which oversees about $252
billion, said in a March telephone interview.  OPEC nations may slow their purchases of Treasuries and
switch to higher-yielding assets should inflation accelerate and
yields fail to move higher as the Federal Reserve sticks to its
forecast that the target rate for overnight loans between banks
will remain at a record low zero to 0.25 percent through 2014,
according to  George Goncalves , head of interest-rate strategy at
Nomura Holdings Inc. in  New York .  “In 2008 they were dipping in with both hands, but the Fed
is pricing them out of the market with rates so low,” Goncalves
said in a telephone interview March 14 in reference to OPEC
nations. Nomura is one of the 21 primary dealers of U.S.
government debt that are obligated to bid at Treasury auctions.  Crude for April delivery rose $1.95 to $107.06 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  on March 16, up 8.3 percent
this year. It was at $107.98 today.  Gasoline Prices  Rising energy prices typically accompany faster economic
growth, which has the potential to hurt bond prices as investors
switch into riskier assets and avoid those that lose value when
inflation accelerates. The  Standard & Poor’s  500 index has risen
12 percent this year, outperforming the 1.8 percent loss in
Treasuries as measured by Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Rather than adding to inflation, oil prices hovering at
about $100 a barrel, almost 60 percent above the average price
of $64 for the past decade, may drag on the economy. Gasoline
prices were $3.80 a gallon on March 13, according to the
American Automobile Association, almost a dollar higher than the
$2.98 average over the past five years.  An extended $10 increase in oil cuts 0.5 percentage point
off U.S. growth over two years, according to Deutsche Bank AG.
The Labor Department said March 16 its consumer price index rose
2.9 percent in February from a year earlier, down from 2011’s
high of 3.9 percent in September and in line with the average of
3 percent over the last 30 years.  ‘Demand Destruction’  “Current oil prices are on the cusp of serious demand
destruction and pullbacks from the consumer,”  Mihir Worah , a
managing director at Pacific Investment Management Co. who
oversees $105 billion in investments aimed at generating returns
higher than inflation, said in a telephone interview March 13.
“It’s inflationary over the short term, but will be a drag on
growth if prices stay elevated.”  Even with this year’s gains, the cost of a barrel of crude
in the U.S., adjusted for total disposable income, is down from
the peak of $213.44 in January 1981, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg and the Energy and Commerce Departments. Oil
consumption was 4.8 percent of income in 2010, compared with 9.7
percent in 1981, the data showed.  Debt Crisis  The economy so far shows signs of absorbing higher oil
prices. Labor Department data show U.S. employers added 1.2
million jobs in the last six months, the most since the same
period ended May 2006. Retail sales in February rose by 1.1
percent, the best since September. Gross domestic product will
expand 2.2 percent this year, according to economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News, from 1.6 percent in 2011.  The U.S. economic recovery will send fixed-income
securities lower, UBS AG, one of the 21 primary dealers that
underwrite Treasuries, said in a March 16 report.  “The secular bear market in bonds has begun,” according
to the report by Larry Hatheway, Sunil Kapadia and Ramin Nakisa
in  London .  OPEC members  last purchased  U.S. debt  faster than the rest
of the world in 2008, when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s
bankruptcy touched off a global financial crisis. They increased
buying by 35 percent, more than the 30.4 percent rise by other
foreign investors, helping 10-year Treasury yields to drop to
2.21 percent from 4.02 percent at the start of that year.  Fewer Alternatives  With Europe suffering with a sovereign debt crisis, there
are fewer alternatives to Treasuries for investors seeking the
greatest safety. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch index shows the
number of issues in its AAA index has fallen to 3,611 from 5,331
in 2007.  “The increase in OPEC buying is consistent with the theme
that emerges, that there are fewer safe havens out there,”
 Aroop Chatterjee , a currency strategist at Barclays Capital Inc.
in New York, said in a telephone interview March 13. “Yields
are super low. It is telling you it is still a very risk-averse
world.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
