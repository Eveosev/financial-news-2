China’s stock-index futures  rose,
signaling gains for the benchmark index, on speculation the
government may introduce measures to boost the economy through
increased  consumer spending .  Futures on the  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  expiring in April, the most
active contract, gained 0.1 percent to 2,625 as of 9:20 a.m.
local time. Liquor maker Kweichow Moutai Co. and Hisense
Electric Co., which sells household appliances, may advance
after Vice Premier  Li Keqiang  said the nation needs to increase
domestic consumption. China Vanke Co. may lead declines for
property developers after home prices posted the worst
performance in a year in February. Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.
may retreat after reporting a wider-than-estimated loss.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 30.96 points, or 1.3
percent, to 2,404.74 on March 16. The CSI 300 Index rose 1.5
percent to 2,623.52. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies,
retreated less than 0.1 percent in  New York .  About 15.8 billion shares changed hands in the Shanghai
Composite on March 16, or 25 percent higher than the daily
average this year. Thirty-day  volatility  on the gauge was at
16.77, near its highest in two weeks.  The Shanghai Composite retreated 1.4 percent last week, the
biggest weekly loss since January. The slump pared this year’s
gains to 9.3 percent in 2012. Stocks in the index trade at 10
times estimated profit, compared with a record low of 8.9 times
on Jan. 6, weekly data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Vice Premier Li said at a forum in Beijing yesterday that
China also needs to stabilize exports as overseas demand remains
weak. Boosting consumption is important “especially this year
as there is slack in international markets,” he said.  Home Prices  February home prices posted the worst performance in a year
with almost half of the cities monitored by the government
falling from a year ago as the country maintained curbs on the
 property market .  New home prices fell in 27 of 70 cities last month from a
year earlier and prices were unchanged in six cities, the
national statistics bureau said in a Feb. 16 statement on its
website. That is the worst since the government began at the
start of 2011 releasing individual data for 70 cities instead of
a national average.  Chalco’s net loss was 174.6 million yuan ($28 million) in
the six months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of 247.4
million yuan a year ago, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on Chalco full-year earnings announced late yesterday. The
loss is wider than the 43.6 million yuan median estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  U.S. China Stocks  Perfect World Co. (PWRD)  advanced the most in more than four
years, leading gains in Chinese stocks traded in the U.S., as
expansion into overseas markets spurred a doubling in profit and
a special dividend.  Online-game developer  Perfect World  jumped 28 percent on
March 16 in New York, the best performer on the  Bloomberg China-
US 55 Index (CH55BN) . The gauge of the most-traded Chinese stocks in the
U.S. rose 0.6 percent last week, bolstered by video sharing
website  Youku Inc. (YOKU) ’s acquisition of competitor  Tudou Holdings
Ltd. (TUDO)   China Eastern  Airlines Corp. traded 1.4 percent below Hong
Kong stock, the biggest discount in almost two weeks.  Perfect World’s profit in the fourth quarter was 68 percent
above the average analyst estimate as the company bolstered
sales of existing games and moved into other markets. The
company said on March 15 it will offer a $2 special dividend.
Youku said on March 12 it will buy Tudou in a stock swap that
values the takeover at $1.1 billion. The merger is a sign
 China ’s video website sector needs consolidation, according to
Tian X Hou, a senior analyst at T.H. Capital LLC.  $95 Million of Dividends  “Perfect World’s special dividend plan and its much
higher-than-expected earnings last quarter helped boost its
stock,” said C. Ming Zhao, a Boston-based analyst at
Susquehanna International Group LLP, who raised his target price
on the company’s American depositary receipts to $19 from $18.
“The Youku-Tudou merger and some companies’ good earnings has
drawn investors attention back to company fundamentals.”  Beijing-based Perfect World said in the March 15 statement
that it will distribute about $95 million to shareholders in
April in a special dividend plan. Net income for the last
quarter of 2011 more than doubled from a year ago to 260 million
yuan ($41 million), or 5.45 yuan per ADR, according to the
statement. Analysts had forecast adjusted net income of 3.53
yuan for each ADR, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  American depositary receipts of Perfect World climbed to
$16.01 on March 16 in the biggest one-day gain since July 2007.  China ETF Drops  The ADRs  trade  at 4 times the company’s estimated earnings
for the next four quarters, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.
 Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , a U.S. online video games provider, trades
at 18 times, the data show. The multiple is 50.5 for  Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) ,
the San Francisco-based social-gaming company that held its
initial public offering in December.  Zhao at Susquehanna said Perfect World continued to benefit
from sales of its existing game inventory, which helped limit
marketing expenses. Expansion into markets including  Brazil ,
 Indonesia  and the U.S. also boosted revenue, he said.  Jonathan Chan, an analyst at CCB International Securities
Ltd., on March 16  upgraded  Perfect World to outperform --meaning
it will gain more than the overall market return --from neutral,
and raised the target price to $15.80 from $11.85. Three other
analysts reiterated their recommendations to buy the stock on
March 16.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., fell 0.3 percent to $38.76,
extending its loss last week to 0.7 percent. The Bloomberg
China-US 55 Index was little changed at 104.82 on March 16.  China Eastern Discount  Tudou, based in Beijing, jumped 145 percent last week to
$37.71, a record weekly gain. Tudou’s shareholders will receive
1.595 ADRs of Youku for each Tudou ADR they own in the stock-
swap deal, according to their joint statement on March 12.
Tudou’s ADRs retreated 3.3 percent on March 16.  Shanghai-based Youku climbed 8.2 percent last week after
the acquisition. Its ADRs slid 4.4 percent to $27.06 on March 16
after soaring 27 percent on March 12 to $31.85.  ADRs of  China Eastern (CEA) , the country’s third-largest carrier
by market value, dropped for a third day, losing 1.1 percent to
$18.23 on March 16. The ADRs, each representing 50 common shares
in the company, traded 1.4 percent  below  its Hong Kong stock,
which added 0.7 percent to HK$2.87, the equivalent of 37 U.S.
cents. The discount was the most since March 6.  Profit at Chinese airlines may drop 50 percent in the first
quarter this year, China Business News reported on March 15,
citing a research note from Ping An Securities Co., a unit of
China’s second-largest insurer.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
