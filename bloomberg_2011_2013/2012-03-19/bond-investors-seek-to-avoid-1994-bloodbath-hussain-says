Bond investors are planning to
hedge against a sudden rise in  interest rates  that would trigger
a selloff parallel to 1994, according to Rizwan Hussain, a New
York-based credit strategist at  Morgan Stanley. (MS)   Treasuries returned 9.8 percent in 2011, and 10-year debt
gained 17 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show, as
the  Federal Reserve  held its benchmark rate near zero since
December 2008. Government debt dropped 3.3 percent in 1994 after
the Fed almost doubled the target for the  federal funds  rate to
5.5 percent in response to inflation threats, the data show.
Treasuries have slid 0.26 percent this year.  “The fear is that you have a dovish Fed for a long time,
and then all of a sudden they start raising rates,” which “led
to the bloodbath in bonds in 1994,” Hussain said. Bond
investors “are trying to avoid a similar outcome, and hence the
move higher in yields we’ve seen at least on a micro level here
recently.”  The central bank pledged to keep rates at a record low zero
to 0.25 percent through 2014 and it also bought $2.3 trillion of
bonds in two rounds of so-called quantitative easing. An
increase in rates may lead to a selloff in debt markets, Hussain
said.  Treasury 10-year notes fell for a ninth consecutive trading
day today, the longest stretch since June 2006, as investors bet
a strengthening economy will diminish the refuge appeal of  U.S.
government debt . Yields on the benchmark security reached the
highest since October last week after the Fed raised its
assessment of the economy, driving investors to riskier assets.
Today it rose to 2.39 percent at 3:09 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Kill the Volatility  Clients are asking how to protect against a spike in rates,
Hussain said. Volatility, as well as the absolute level of
rates, matters when it comes to protecting credit, so “kill off
the volatility” and it will provide a much better investing
environment, he said.  Bonds were hurt in the the 1994 selloff, Hussain said. The
spread widening was mostly manageable, he said, pointing out
that yield margins were starting from a much tighter level than
where they are now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
