Total SA (FP)  may offer $113 million in
cash for  Wessex Exploration Plc (WSX) , the owner of a minority stake
in licenses off  French Guiana  that hold more than a billion
barrels of oil.  Total said today it approached Wessex at 10 pence a share,
compared with a closing price of 7.35 pence on March 16. The
board of directors of Wessex, which holds an effective 1.25
percent interest in the Guyane Maritime license, would recommend
such an offer in the absence of a higher bid. Wessex shares
jumped 29 percent to 9.5 pence in  London .  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW) , the operator of the Zaedyus wells that
unlocked a new oil frontier off the northeast coast of  South
America , is targeting about 1.4 billion barrels of resources in
three wells off French Guiana. The Zaedyus-1 well, completed
last year, found light and heavy oil. Tullow last week increased
its reserves estimate for the field to 840 million barrels of
oil equivalent from 700 million.  Wessex also holds 70 percent of the Juan de Nova Est permit
in the Mozambique Channel off the island of  Madagascar , as well
as acreage in the U.K. and northwest Africa.  French Guiana is an overseas region of  France  with a
population of about 230,000. Tullow has a 27.5 percent stake in
the Guyane Maritime license, Royal Dutch Shell Plc has 45
percent, Total 25 percent and Northpet 2.5 percent. Wessex and
 Northern Petroleum Plc (NOP)  each own half of Northpet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
