Kuwait Gulf Oil Co. , a unit of
state-run  Kuwait  Petroleum Corp., plans to produce about 400
million cubic feet a day of non-associated natural gas by 2020,
the official  KUNA  news agency reported.  Output will increase to 500 million cubic feet a day by
2030, the agency said, citing Hashim el-Rifai, Kuwait Gulf Oil’s
chairman. The report did not say how much non-associated gas
Kuwait Gulf Oil produces now.  Sami al-Rushaid, the chairman of Kuwait Oil Co., Kuwait
Petroleum’s production arm, said in November 2010 that Kuwait
was producing about 1 billion cubic feet of gas a day less than
it needed for domestic needs. The country had an output at that
time of 1 billion cubic feet of associated gas, which is found
together with oil, and 130 million to 140 million cubic feet of
non-associated gas, which occurs in deposits of its own.  Kuwait Gulf Oil controls and manages the emirate’s portion
of the so-called  Divided Zone  where Kuwait and  Saudi Arabia  are
developing energy resources along their shared border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
