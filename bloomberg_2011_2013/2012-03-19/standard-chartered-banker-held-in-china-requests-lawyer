Requests by Wu Yidian Eden, the
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  private banker being detained by police
in  China , to meet with a lawyer have been passed on to Chinese
authorities, the Singapore Consulate-General in  Shanghai  said.  Staff of the consulate visited Wu, 31, who is being held in
Jiangyin, a city in coastal Jiangsu province, on March 16,
attache Lynn Ho said in an e-mailed response to queries today.
Police have held Wu, a naturalized Singapore citizen, since
March 6 in an investigation of one of her clients, according to
Jason David Tan, Wu’s fiance.  The Singapore government’s representative in Shanghai will
keep in touch with Wu and the Chinese authorities and continue
to assist her and her family, Ho said.  Three calls to the Jiangyin police press office and five
calls to the government press office in Wuxi, which has
jurisdiction over Jiangyin, weren’t answered.  Standard Chartered , the London-based lender whose pretax
earnings from China doubled in 2011, said it isn’t under
investigation. The lender declined to comment further as it’s an
ongoing investigation.  Wu’s client allegedly fled with as much as $50 million
embezzled from  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. , Tan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
