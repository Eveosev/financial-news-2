Huaneng Renewables Corp. (958) , a clean-
energy unit of  China ’s biggest electricity producer, reported
net income that missed estimates as the growth of the nation’s
wind-power installation slowed.  The unit of China Huaneng Group Corp. generated profit of
1.02 billion yuan in 2011, a 94 percent gain from a year
earlier, Huaneng said yesterday in a statement to the Hong Kong
stock exchange. That is less than the 1.2 billion yuan mean
estimate of six analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  China’s wind-power development is slowing due to a tighter
government approval process for projects on concern about power
grids’ ability to handle capacity. The nation increased wind-
installed capacity by 18 percent last year from a year earlier,
compared with a 67 percent rise in 2010, according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance.  “In 2011, 32 projects with a capacity of 1,653.0 MW were
newly approved by relevant authorities,” the company said.
Huaneng increased its installed wind-power capacity by 40
percent to 4.9 gigawatts from the previous year, missing a
target of about 5.1 gigawatts the company set in May.  Karl Liu, an analyst from ICBC International Research Ltd.,
wrote in a Mar. 5 report that he expected “comparably weak”
2011 earnings from wind-power operators. He expected Huaneng to
report the highest earnings growth compared with  China Datang
Corp. Renewable Power Co. (1798)  and  China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ,
the nation’s biggest wind-farm developer.  Datang yesterday posted a 60 percent gain in profit of
729.8 million yuan last year.  Huaneng Renewables’ stock fell 1.44 percent to HK$2.06
yesterday, before the announcement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
