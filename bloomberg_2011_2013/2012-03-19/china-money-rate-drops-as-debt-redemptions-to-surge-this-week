China ’s money-market rate declined
on speculation rising redemptions of central-bank bills and
repurchase contracts will improve the availability of cash.  A total of 51 billion yuan ($8.1 billion) of the securities
will be redeemed this week, compared with 29 billion yuan last
week, according to Liu Junyu, a bond analyst at China Merchants
Bank Co. The central bank has refrained from issuing three-month
and one-year  bills  since Dec. 22 and Dec. 27, respectively.  “The suspension of bills and rising redemptions have
helped boost liquidity,” said Liu. “But there is a possibility
that the central bank may resume bill sales this month to curb
cash supply.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped one basis point to 2.89 percent as
of 5:04 p.m. in  Shanghai , according to a weighted average rate
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  The central bank gauged demand today for sales of three-
month bills, 28- and 91-day repurchase contracts, according to a
trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, rose one basis
point to 3.16 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 3.57 percent government bonds due November
2021 climbed one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.56
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  --Judy Chen. Editors: Ven Ram, Simon Harvey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
