Palo Alto Networks will seek to
raise about $250 million in an initial public offering this year
that would value the Internet security company at about $1.5
billion, said a person with direct knowledge of the situation.  The company chose Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley,
Credit Suisse Group AG and Citigroup Inc. as its underwriters
and will submit an S-1 filing in a couple of weeks, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the plans aren’t
public.  Palo Alto Networks’s firewalls give companies precise
control over what their employees can access through the
Internet. The products have been installed at more than 5,300
companies, government entities and Web service providers,
according to Palo Alto Networks’s website.  Co-founded by Nir Zuk in 2005, Palo Alto Networks generated
more than $200 million sales last fiscal year. In August, it
hired Mark D. McLaughlin from  VeriSign Inc. (VRSN)  to become chief
executive officer ahead of an IPO.  Investors include  Sequoia Capital , Globespan Capital
Partners,  Greylock Partners  and JAFCO Ventures.  A spokesman for Palo Alto Networks declined to comment, as
did representatives from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,
Citigroup and Credit Suisse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
