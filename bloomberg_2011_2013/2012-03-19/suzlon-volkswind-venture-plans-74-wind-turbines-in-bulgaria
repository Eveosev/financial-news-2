DIV Wind OOD, co-owned by  India ’s
 Suzlon Wind Energy Ltd. (SUEL)  and Volkswind GmbH, is planning to build
about 74  wind turbines  in Bulgaria.  The wind project near Balchik in northeastern Bulgaria will
be at least 150 megawatts in capacity depending on the size of
turbine used, DIV company director Malte Huchzermeier said today
by phone.  DIV, based in Sofia, has obtained the required approvals
and completed necessary studies for the project, Huchzermeier
said. Construction can begin once grid connections are received,
which Huchzermeier said he expects next year.  “There’s a huge demand for energy and a huge demand for
interconnecting wind farm projects,” he said by phone from
Bremen, Germany. “The supply of the grid has to keep pace with
this demand and this is the problem.”  The company is a venture between Suzlon and Volkswind, a
German wind farm developer based in Ganderkesee that has built
60 wind farms, according to the company website.  Bulgaria  has
good quality wind sites while wind markets in nations such as
Germany, Spain and Denmark mature, Huchzermeier said. Bulgaria
also offers a feed-in tariff for wind plants, he said.  Bulgaria had 612 megawatts of installed  wind energy  at the
end of last year, according to data from the European Wind
Energy Association. The provisional data showed the nation added
112 megawatts in 2011.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
