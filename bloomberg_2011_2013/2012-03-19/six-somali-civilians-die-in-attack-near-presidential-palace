Six Somali civilians died when
mortars slammed into a camp for displaced people near the
presidential palace in the capital, Mogadishu, late yesterday, a
witness said.  A family of four was among the dead, Hassan Dool, a camp
resident, said in an interview at the Medina hospital. Six
others were wounded in the nighttime mortar barrage, he said.  The attack was the second in a week near the presidential
palace, following a March 14 suicide bombing by al-Shabaab, the
al-Qaeda-linked Islamist militia, at a government compound that
killed at least three people.  Al-Shabaab has waged an insurgency against the United
Nations-backed transitional administration of President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed since 2007. It withdrew its forces from
Mogadishu in August following advances by  African Union -backed
government soldiers and pledged to carry out guerrilla attacks
in the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
