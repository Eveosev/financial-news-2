There’s a surprising vogue in
 London  for exhibitions designed to make Britons look bad.  Hard on the heels of “Picasso and Modern British Art” at
 Tate Britain  -- documenting how Pablo thought of everything
first and did it better -- comes “Turner Inspired: In the Light
of Claude” at the  National Gallery  (until June 5).  Predictably, the plucky British challenger comes off worse.
Though the contest isn’t catastrophic for J.M.W. Turner, it’s a
victory on points for the Franco-Italian master. The exhibition
demonstrates that Turner (1775-1851) spent a lot of time and
energy emulating Claude Lorrain (c.1600-1682). The trouble is,
it also suggests that he overdid the hero worship.  There’s a fashion for these comparisons between artists of
different eras. Turner and Claude are not nearly such a hopeless
mismatch as Twombly and Poussin -- shown together last year at
the  Dulwich Picture Gallery  -- a combination that might have
been the answer to the question, “Which two painters in history
had the least in common?” At this show, you go away feeling
that Turner was at his best when he wasn’t trying to channel
Claude.  British Passion  He was far from alone, however, in this painterly passion.
The British have long been potty about Claude. He was born in
what is now eastern  France , and based throughout his
professional life in  Rome . His art was a blend of northern
European naturalism with Italian classicism. It combined the
warm south, ancient architecture and the natural world -- all
ingredients of which the British were (and are) extremely fond.  Georgian aristocrats landscaped their estates to look as
much as possible like Claude’s idealized version of central
 Italy . It’s estimated that by 1820 about half the paintings the
artist produced were in British collections. A lot of them still
are. One of the pleasures of the exhibition is the opportunity
it gives to enjoy marvelous Claudes from  Holkham Hall  in Norfolk
and  Anglesey Abbey  outside Cambridge.  It’s easy to see why Turner admired this predecessor (he
called him “aerial Claude”), and just what he got from him.
Claude painted not just dawn and dusk, but dozens of different
kinds of sunrise and sunset: apricot evening clouds, lemon-
yellow skies with blue-green shadows in the woods below plus
milky morning light, serene afternoons, the full blaze of the
rising Mediterranean sun. All observed with amazing, delicate
accuracy.  Cool Vista  Turner, too, was a supreme painter of light and atmosphere.
You can see that most clearly in this exhibition when he isn’t
imitating Claude too closely: in the wonderful watercolor
“Sunrise” (1825) -- entirely in shades of lemon yellow with
the paler disc of the sun in the center -- or the fine “Keelmen
Heaving in Coals by Night” (1835), a cool northern vista of
ships on the Tyne.  The pictures by Claude are a combination of brilliant
observation of the fresh-air world outside the studio and
Baroque theatricality: the framing trees and classical temples,
the nymphs, shepherds and grazing flocks scattered in the
foreground. That worked for him, but when Turner follows the
formula the results look -- next to the originals -- stagey and
over-bright.  Claude still strikes a chord.  David Hockney  devotes a room
of his current Royal Academy exhibition to variations on a theme
by the 17th-century master. Personally, I could spend all day
looking at Claude’s endlessly varied landscape moods. So after
this appetizer, how about giving us a proper Claude show?  “Turner Inspired: In the Light of Claude” runs through
June 5 at the National Gallery, which is supported by  Credit
