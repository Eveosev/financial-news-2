Olam International Ltd. (OLAM) , the
commodity supplier partly owned by Singapore’s Temasek Holdings
Pte, will invest in 28,000 hectares (69,000 acres) of rubber
plantations in a venture with the Gabon government.  The total investment will be about $183 million and Olam
will have an 80 percent interest in the venture and Gabon will
have the balance, the company said today in a statement.
Planting will start in June 2013 and finish in 2019, Ashish
Govil, Olam’s head of rubber, said today on a conference call.  The venture may expand to 50,000 hectares depending on the
first phase, Olam said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
