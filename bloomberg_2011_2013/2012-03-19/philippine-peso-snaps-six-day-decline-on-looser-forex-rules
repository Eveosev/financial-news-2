The Philippine peso snapped six
days of losses after the central bank further liberalized rules
on foreign-exchange transactions. Bonds declined, pushing 10-
year yields to an 11-week high.  The peso rose the most in more than a week after Bangko
Sentral ng Pilipinas announced on March 16 that it will raise
the limit on dollar purchases by importers that don’t need to be
supported by documents to $500,000 from $50,000. Growth in the
Southeast Asian nation’s $200 billion economy will accelerate to
4.2 percent this year and 5 percent in 2013 from  3.7 percent  in
2011, the  World Bank  said in a report today.  The relaxation of rules “would be positive for the peso
because of less stringent regulations,” said  Enrico Tanuwidjaja ,
a Singapore-based senior currency analyst at Malayan Banking Bhd.
“The fundamentals remain positive for the  Philippines .”  The peso climbed 0.4 percent to 42.890 per dollar as of
4:18 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The
currency, which has advanced 2.2 percent so far this year, may
appreciate to 42.50 this month, Tanuwidjaja predicted. The
peso’s one-month implied volatility, which measures exchange-
rate swings used to price options, dropped to 6.3 percent from
6.5 percent.  The central bank said March 16 that banks and money-
changers don’t need to submit hard copies of inflow and
remittance reports. In November, companies were given until
February 2012 to pay foreign-currency loans which weren’t
registered with the central bank with dollars bought from banks.  “Earlier reforms with much more far-reaching changes did
not upset orderly trading in the foreign-exchange” market,
central bank Deputy Governor Diwa Guinigundo said in a mobile-
phone message on March 16. “This could further increase market
confidence because it shows the economy is strong enough to
undergo this latest foreign-exchange liberalization.”  The yield on the 6.375 percent bond due January 2022
increased 15 basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 5.40
percent, prices from Tradition Financial Services showed. That
was the highest level since Jan. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
