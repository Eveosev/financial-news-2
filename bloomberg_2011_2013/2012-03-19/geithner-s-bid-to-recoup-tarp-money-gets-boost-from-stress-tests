Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  is getting a boost from the  Federal Reserve  as he seeks
to recoup taxpayer money used to bail out banks during the
financial crisis.  Regions Financial Corp. (RF)  and  Zions Bancorporation (ZION)  last week
said they plan to repay money they received through the Troubled
Asset Relief Program after passing Fed stress tests. The tests,
designed to ensure that the largest U.S. banks could withstand
another severe recession, indicate that that the two lenders are
strong enough to repay TARP.  The Treasury is trying to unwind the biggest chunks of TARP
as President Barack Obama gears up for his re-election campaign.
The public outcry over bailouts in 2008 and 2009 remains part of
the political debate. Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who was against bailouts, has criticized rival  Mitt Romney  for supporting aid to banks while opposing help for
automakers.  “The administration needs to clean this out,” said
Clifford Rossi, a former managing director of  Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s
consumer lending group and a University of Maryland professor of
business. “Now with the stress test release, this is a good
time to pull the trigger.”  Regions and Zions are the biggest recipients of aid among
the 361 banks left in the bailout program. Regions, based in
Birmingham, Alabama, owes $3.5 billion, and Salt Lake City-based
Zions must return $1.4 billion. Their payments would reduce the
total still owed by banks to the Treasury by about a third, to
$11.1 billion.  Selling Stakes  The Treasury is now starting to divest stakes in the
remaining banks, most of them small or medium-sized. The
department said March 14 it would sell shares in six banks
through auctions on or about March 26, including Banner Corp. of
Walla Walla, Washington, and First Financial Holdings Inc. of
Charleston,  South Carolina .  Today, Treasury announced it has wrapped up its mortgage
bond program with a $25 billion profit. The Treasury received
$250 billion by selling its agency guaranteed mortgage-backed
securities it purchased from  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac  in 2008
and 2009. The Treasury purchased $225 billion in government-
sponsored-enterprise bonds and made the profit of $25 billion
from principal, interest and the sale.  Recover Dollars  “We’re working to wind down TARP, exit our investments as
soon as practicable, and recover taxpayer dollars,” Treasury
spokesman  Matthew Anderson  said in a March 16 e-mail.
“Replacing temporary government support with private capital is
an important part of continuing to restore financial
stability.”  Investors are eager to see whether the Treasury will “get
creative in working with private-equity firms to unload the
stakes in these smaller banks,” said  Jaret Seiberg , senior
policy analyst at Guggenheim Securities’  Washington  Research
Group. Shares of small banks could be bundled together and sold,
he said.  The Fed on March 13 said all 15 of the 19 largest U.S.
banks it tested would be able to maintain capital levels above a
regulatory minimum in an “extremely adverse” economic scenario
-- even while continuing to pay dividends and repurchasing
stock. The scenario included a 13 percent  unemployment rate  and
a 21 percent drop in  home prices .  Citigroup  Citigroup Inc., the lender that took the most government
aid during the financial crisis, said it will resubmit its
capital plan to regulators after failing to meet some minimum
standards in the tests. Citigroup has repaid $45 billion in TARP
money.  SunTrust Banks Inc. repaid $4.85 billion in preferred stock
to get out of TARP in March 2011, and MetLife Inc. didn’t
receive any TARP funds. Ally Financial Inc., the Detroit-based
lender previously known as GMAC, was rescued with a $17.2
billion bailout in 2008 and is still majority-owned by the
government.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and  Wells Fargo & Co . were among banks
announcing plans to increase dividends or buy back stock after
passing the stress tests. The announcements helped propel a 9.4
percent increase in the  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  of 24 lenders in four
days.  Regions and Zions are the only TARP banks that owe the
Treasury more than $1 billion apiece. Getting the remaining
banks out of the program won’t be easy and probably can’t be
done by the end of the year, said Brian Gardner, senior vice
president of Washington research at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc.  Slow Process  “Getting out of TARP is a slow, grinding process,”
Gardner said. “Some of them are not publicly traded and have
limited access to the credit markets.”  Banks have an incentive to exit TARP because the 5 percent
annual dividend they pay the Treasury increases to 9 percent
after five years in the program. According to the Treasury, 158
banks missed their last scheduled dividend payment.  The Obama administration has highlighted the performance of
the TARP bank program, which has returned about $259 billion,
more than the $245 billion lenders received. The largest U.S.
banks, including Citigroup,  Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., which all received bailouts from the George W. Bush administration in 2008, have repaid.  The government has recouped $331 billion of $414 billion in
TARP funds that were disbursed, when the Treasury’s bailouts for
 American International Group Inc. (AIG) , automakers  General Motors Co. (GM) 
and Chrysler Group LLC, and foreclosure-prevention programs are
included, according to Treasury data.  Campaign Trail  “Politically, it would be great to say on the campaign
trail the program the Bush administration started to keep the
banks functioning, that you unwound it at a profit,” Seiberg
said. “The government doesn’t want to be in the business of
owning banks.”  Regions, the 10th-largest  U.S. bank  by deposits, sold
shares on March 14 for 2.1 percent more than the previous day’s
closing price, raising $900 million to help repay the bailout
money.  Standard & Poor’s  restored Regions’ investment-grade
credit  rating  on March 15.  The lender, which hasn’t reported an annual profit since
2007 in the wake of the U.S. housing crisis, is spending less on
soured loans and agreed in January to sell its Morgan Keegan
brokerage unit to Raymond James Financial Inc. under terms that
ultimately will generate proceeds of $1.18 billion for Regions.  TARP Repayments  Grayson Hall, Regions’ president and chief executive
officer, said in a March 13 statement that the bank has already
paid the Treasury $593 million in dividends.  Zions, the Salt Lake City-based lender, said in a March 13
statement that it plans to repay its $1.4 billion in TARP in two
installments of $700 million each. The second portion is
contingent on the return of $500 million to Zions from its
subsidiaries in the second half of this year.  The Obama administration wants “the idea of a bailout in
the rear-view mirror,” said Kip Weissman, a partner at Luse
Gorman Pomerenk & Schick P.C. in Washington. “Any TARP payment
increases the overall profit on the program, which is a good
thing from an election standpoint.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
