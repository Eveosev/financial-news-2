Recent measures taken by the
Argentine government, including changes to the central bank
charter and pressure for oil companies to boost production,
signal a “more orthodox policy mix,” according to a Morgan
Stanley report e-mailed today.  Recent removals of  YPF SA (YPFD) ’s oil operating licenses serve as
a “warning” and don’t mean the government plans to nationalize
Argentina’s biggest energy company, Morgan Stanley economist
 Daniel Volberg  wrote. The measures are aimed at increasing
production and securing the nation’s trade and current account
balances, he said.  Changes to the central bank’s charter will allow greater
flexibility in the use of international reserves to meet
international debt payments, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
