Requiring graphic cigarette warning
labels doesn’t violate the U.S. Constitution’s free speech
guarantee, a Cincinnati-based federal appeals court ruled.  The labeling, made mandatory by the 2009 Family Smoking
Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, was challenged by  R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co. (RJREYZ)  and Lorillard Tobacco Co. and other makers
and sellers of tobacco products as unlawfully compelling speech.  “The warning labels required by the act do not impose any
restriction of plaintiffs’ dissemination of speech,” the court
said. “Instead the labels serve as disclaimers to the public
regarding the incontestable health consequences of using
tobacco.”  The 2-1 ruling today follows a Feb. 29 decision by a
federal judge in  Washington  who said the rule does violate the
cigarette makers’ free-speech rights. The U.S. is appealing that
decision.  The appellate case is Discount Tobacco City & Lottery Inc.
v. U.S., 10-5234 and 10-5235, U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals
(Cincinnati). The Washington case is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 11-cv-1482, U.S. District
Court,  District of Columbia  (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
