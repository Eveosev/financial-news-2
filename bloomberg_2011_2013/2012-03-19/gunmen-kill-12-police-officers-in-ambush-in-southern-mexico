Twelve police officers were killed
and nine were wounded when they were ambushed by gunmen about 90
miles (145 kilometers) southwest of Mexico City, according to
the Attorney General’s office.  Six state police officer and six municipal officers were
killed in the attack in Teloloapan, Guerrero state at around
5:30 p.m. local time, Attorney General press chief Roberto Camps
said in a telephone interview.  The police were following up on a report of a suspicious
truck and were not part of an investigation of 10 severed heads
found in Teloloapan earlier in the day as originally reported by
state police, Camps said.  “We have not found any relation between the officers’
deaths and the heads discovered yesterday,” Camps said.  Ten severed heads were found in the streets of Teloloapan
alongside a message that read “This is going to happen to all
those who continue to support La Familia,” in reference to the
La Familia drug cartel. The message was signed by the “Guerreros
Unidos” cartel.  The investigation could not link the deaths of the police
officers to drug cartels at this time, Camps said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
