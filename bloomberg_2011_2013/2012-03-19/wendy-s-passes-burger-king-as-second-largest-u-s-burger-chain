Wendy’s Co. (WEN)  surpassed  Burger King
Holdings Inc. (BKC)  in sales last year, making it the second-largest
U.S. hamburger chain, according to Chicago-based researcher
Technomic Inc.  Sales at Dublin, Ohio-based Wendy’s U.S. locations were
$8.5 billion last year, while Miami-based Burger King’s sales
were $8.4 billion, according to Technomic.  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) ,
based in  Oak Brook ,  Illinois , is the largest chain with $34.2
billion in sales at all of its U.S. stores in 2011.  Wendy’s Chief Executive Officer Emil Brolick has sought to
boost sales recently by promoting more expensive, premium
burgers and has started remodeling its U.S. stores to lure
consumers. Sales at the 500 largest U.S. dining chains advanced
3.4 percent to about $242 billion last year, compared with an
increase of 1.8 percent in 2010, the researcher said.  Technomic will release its chain restaurant report on April
13.  Closely held  Five Guys Burgers and Fries , with sales of
$951 million last year, was listed as the fastest-growing chain
with sales greater than $200 million. Five Guys is based in
Lorton, Virginia.  Wendy’s fell 0.2 percent to $5.03, and McDonald’s rose 0.1
percent to $97.73 at the close in  New York .  Burger King has attempted to gain market share and turn
around declining same-restaurant sales in  North America  by
revamping its menu with new French fries and soft-serve ice
cream. 3G Capital Inc.  bought  Burger King in 2010 for about
$3.93 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
