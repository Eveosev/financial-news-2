     March 19 (Bloomberg) --Brent oil declined in London after
data showed Saudi Arabian crude output at close to the largest
level in three decades. U.S. crude advanced.  Futures fell as much as 0.8 percent.  Saudi Arabia , the
largest producer in OPEC, pumped 9.87 million barrels a day in
January, according to data submitted to the Joint Organization
Data Initiative. Bank of America Corp. raised 2012 price
forecasts after the economic recovery beat expectations.  “There’s no immediate supply shortage,” said  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in London, who correctly
predicted last month that prices had peaked in the short-term.
“As Brent gets past $120, market participants start worrying
about demand and hence you’re getting extremely choppy trading
at the moment. It’s unlikely we’ll see a sustained push higher
from here.”  Brent oil for May settlement was at $125.36 a barrel, down
45 cents, on ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . The European
benchmark contract was at a  premium  of $17.58 to New York
futures for the same month.  Oil for April delivery was at $107.33 a barrel, up 27
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 12:06 p.m. London time. The contract, which expires tomorrow,
climbed 1.9 percent to $107.06 on March 16, the highest close
since March 9. The more actively traded May future gained 23
cents to $107.81 today.  Saudi Output  Bank of America raised its price forecasts for this year to
$118 a barrel for  Brent crude  and to $106 for West Texas
Intermediate because of supply constraints, according to an e-
mailed report today.  “To reflect better-than-expected global economic
conditions and tighter-than-expected supplies, we raise our 2012
Brent and WTI price forecasts,”  Francisco Blanch , the bank’s
New York-based head of commodities research, said in the report.  While Brent may temporarily rise to $140, further price
gains “will prove unsustainable and create risks to the
economy,” Blanch wrote.  Saudi Arabia’s January crude output rose 0.6 percent from
December and compares with 10.05 million barrels a day in
November. The U.S. Energy Department said November’s increase
was the largest in at least 31 years.  Oil exports from the kingdom climbed 2 percent in January
to 7.5 million barrels, the JODI data show. Shipments by  Iran ,
the second-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, climbed to 2.3 million barrels, the highest
since December 2008. JODI is supervised by the Riyadh-based
International Energy Forum and compiles data provided by member
governments.  ‘Bumpy Ride’  Oil prices  will have a “bumpy ride in the months ahead”
because of a “slim buffer” of spare crude-production capacity,
the  International Energy Agency  said in its monthly market
report on March 14. World oil supplies are “tight” with spare
capacity at about 2.5 million barrels a day compared with 3.5
million in 2008 to 2010, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman said the same day.  Home purchases in the U.S. probably rose in February to the
highest level in almost two years, a sign of stabilization in
the real-estate market, according to Bloomberg News surveys of
economists before reports this week.  “We’re looking at a period of moderate growth in the U.S.,
and the outlook has picked up,” said Ric Spooner, a chief
market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney who sees WTI trading in
a range of about $104 to $108. “If it continues on from here up
into $108 plus, that would start to look as though it was making
a bit more of a positive statement in terms of breaking
resistance from a technical point of view.”  Hedge funds  decreased oil wagers on rising prices by 6,188,
or 2.5 percent, to 258,406  contracts  in the seven days ended
March 13, according to the according to Commodity Futures
Trading Commission’s Commitments of Traders report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
