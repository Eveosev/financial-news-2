PetroEcuador, the South American
country’s state-owned oil company, named its former president
Carlos Pareja the head of refining operations, four years after
firing him for poor management.  Pareja, a chemical engineer who was the country’s vice
minister of oil until his appointment, will replace Marcelo
Robalino, the company said in an e-mailed statement today,
citing Chief Executive Officer Marco Calvopina. The statement
didn’t say why Robalino was stepping down.  Ecuador, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’
smallest member, is reorganizing its operations after seeing
production decline 2.7 percent to 504,000 barrels a day since
President  Rafael Correa  took office in January 2007, according
to the country’s central bank. PetroEcuador is spending $1.4
billion to repair its Esmeraldas and Shushufindi refineries to
boost output and improve fuel quality.  Pareja was dismissed in 2007 amid protests that halted
production at 47  oil wells  in the country’s Amazon region and
prompted Correa to declare the company in a state of emergency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
