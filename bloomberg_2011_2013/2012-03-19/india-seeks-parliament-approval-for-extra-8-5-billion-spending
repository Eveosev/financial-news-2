Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee sought parliamentary approval for additional cash
spending of 426.06 billion rupees ($8.5 billion) in the current
fiscal year to pay for fuel and fertilizer subsidies.  The approval is part of a 4.3 trillion rupee spending plan
of which 3.88 trillion rupees will come from unutilized funds
earmarked for expenditure in the year to March, the minister
said in a statement in New Delhi today.  Mukherjee’s annual budget on March 16 unveiled record
borrowings of 5.69 trillion rupees for the fiscal year beginning
April 1, 2012. The announcement sent bonds lower and prompted
Moody’s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor’s
to cite public finances as a constraint on the credit rating of
Asia’s third-largest economy.  The government plans to give 148.38 billion rupees of the
extra amount to state-run refiners for selling fuels below cost.
It will give 72.01 billion rupees to fertilizer companies for
selling products at lower than market prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
