Vattenfall AB,  Sweden ’s biggest
utility, plans to test a Pelamis Wave Power Ltd. device at the
European Marine Energy Center in  Scotland .  Vattenfall is seeking to take up the last remaining test
berth at the research center, and begin trials in 2014, it said
today in an e-mailed statement. The purchase of a Pelamis
machine depends on an interconnector cable being laid between
the mainland and Shetland Islands, where Vattenfall is proposing
an array of at least 10 wave power machines, the company said.  Energy from the waves and tides has the potential to meet
as much as 20 percent of current U.K. electricity demand.
Scotland plans to get all of its electricity from renewable
sources by 2020, and has about 10 percent of  Europe ’s total wave
resources, according to the government.  “If Vattenfall is to use ocean energy to support its long
term shift to low carbon generation, it needs to be confident
that the technology it uses will be safe, reliable and
productive,” Veijo Huusko, head of low-emitting energy research
and development, said in the statement. “Scotland remains the
most attractive place to explore the possibilities of ocean
energy thanks to strong political backing, appropriate financial
support and an exceptional energy resource.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
