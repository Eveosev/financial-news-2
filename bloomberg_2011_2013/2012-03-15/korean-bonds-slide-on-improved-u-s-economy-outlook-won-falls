South Korea ’s bonds fell for a
second day, sending the three-year yield to the highest level
since August, as a slump in U.S. Treasuries narrowed their
interest-rate advantage. The won slid to a one-month low.  The U.S. 10-year note’s  yield  rose 33 basis points this
week to 2.33 percent, narrowing the premium offered by similar-
maturity South Korean debt. The gap shrank 26 basis points to
162 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Unemployment in the U.S. will “decline gradually” and the
inflation outlook is “subdued,” the  Federal Reserve  said in a
statement on March 13.  “The Fed’s economic outlook and not adding further
monetary stimulus are continuing to affect  U.S. Treasuries  and
Korean bonds,” said Kong Dong Rak, a Seoul-based fixed-income
analyst at Taurus Investment & Securities Co. “I expect the
three-year Korean yield to rise to 3.6 percent, a level that
investors would think as cheap enough to buy.”  The yield on South Korea’s 3.25 percent bonds due December
2014 climbed six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.58
percent at the close in  Seoul , Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
That’s the highest for a  benchmark three-year note  since August.
Three-year debt futures fell 0.12 percent to 103.91. The one-
year interest-rate swap climbed two basis points to 3.56 percent.  The won slipped 0.1 percent to 1,127.85 per dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,132.03 earlier, the lowest since Feb. 16. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, rose 35 basis points to 9.08 percent. The  Kospi Index (KOSPI) 
of shares declined less than 0.1 percent.  “A stronger dollar contributed to the weaker won today,
but losses were limited as exporters sold the dollar to convert
income,” said Jeon Seung Ji, a Seoul-based currency analyst at
Samsung Futures Inc.  A free-trade agreement reached more than four years ago
between South Korea and the U.S. takes effect today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
