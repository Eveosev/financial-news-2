QGEP Participacoes SA (QGEP3) , a Rio de
Janeiro-based oil explorer, declined the most on record after
reducing estimated potential volumes at an oil discovery in deep
waters off the coast of Brazil.  QGEP fell 15 percent to 13.19 reais at 11:28 a.m. in  Sao
Paulo , after plummeting as much as 17 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since it started trading on Feb. 9, 2011.  The company reduced its potential volumes estimate for a
section of the Ilha do Macuro project after  Petroleo Brasileiro
SA (PETR4) , the operator of the well, studied drilling results, QGEP
said in a statement late yesterday. Petrobras, as the state-run
producer is known, will continue drilling and test another
prospect deeper beneath the ocean floor, QGEP said.  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  downgraded QGEP Participacoes SA to
market perform from outperform after the company reported the
negative drilling results, analysts led by Auro Rozenbaum said
in note to clients today.  QGEP is still optimistic about finding oil at the Ilha do
Macuro well and is also looking at opportunities to buy
additional exploration acreage in Brazil, Chief Exploration
Officer Lincoln Rumenos Guardado said in a conference call
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
