Sands China Ltd. (1928) , the casino
operator controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson ’s  Las Vegas
Sands Corp. (LVS) , said a Macau company filed a compensation claim of
3 billion patacas ($375 million) against its subsidiary and
three other companies.  Asian American Entertainment Corp., which filed the claim
with the Macau judicial court, is seeking compensation for
damages resulting from the alleged breach of agreements related
to a bid for the Macau government’s award of gaming concessions
in 2001, Sands said today in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock
exchange.  Sands’ subsidiary Venetian Macau S.A. as well as LVS
(Nevada) International Holdings Inc., Las Vegas Sands LLC and
Venetian Casino Resort Hotel LLC were the four companies named
in the claim, according to the statement.  The claim relates to events that occurred before the
subsidiary, the Venetian Macau, was incorporated in June 2002,
Sands said, without disclosing details. Sands China spokeswoman
Mabel Wu declined to comment further.  New York Times reported on March 13 that Asian American
Entertainment was Sands’ former partner controlled by the
Taiwanese businessman Shi Sheng Hao. The company accused Sands
of improperly breaking off a 2001 agreement to bid for a Macau
casino license, the report said, citing a court filing.  Sands China shares were unchanged at HK$30.75 in  Hong Kong 
trading as of 3:22 p.m, while the benchmark  Hang Seng Index 
gained 0.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
