LSI Corp. (LSI) , a maker of chips used in
computer disk drives, filed a complaint with a U.S. trade agency
against Funai Electric Co.,  MediaTek Inc. (2454)  and  Realtek
Semiconductor Corp. (2379)  over technology used in audiovisual devices.  LSI, based in Milpitas, California, said in its complaint
with the International Trade Commission that the companies
infringed four of its patents. It asked the agency to open an
investigation. The Washington-based commission has the power to
halt imports of products that violate U.S. patents.  LSI said products using its patented technology without
authorization include certain digital televisions, home theater
systems and DVD players. The company asked the agency to block
imports of products containing the infringed technology.  Funai is an  Osaka , Japan-based maker of audiovisual
equipment; Mediatek is a Hsinchu, Taiwan-based maker of
semiconductors; and Realtek is a Hsinchu-based designer and
distributor of integrated circuits.  The case is In the Matter of Certain Audiovisual Components
and Products Containing the Same, Complaint No. 2884, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
