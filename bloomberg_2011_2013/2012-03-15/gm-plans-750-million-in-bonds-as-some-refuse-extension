MGM Resorts International (MGM)  got its
lowest  interest rate  on unsecured notes in almost five years
with a boosted $1 billion bond offering, highlighting the
recovery of the biggest casino operator on the  Las Vegas Strip .  MGM’s 7.75 percent, 10-year notes, sold today at 5.47
percentage points above similar-maturity Treasuries, were up
from the $750 million the company had sought, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest on unsecured debt from
the company since May 2007.  Standard & Poor’s  revised its outlook on MGM, rated B-, to
“positive” today, citing growth trends in  Las Vegas  and
reduced refinancing risk. That’s  improved  from as low as CCC in
the first half of 2009. The company sold $850 million of 8.625
percent, seven-year notes in January at the lowest unsecured
interest rate it obtained since before the economic downturn,
Dan D’Arrigo, MGM’s chief financial officer and treasurer, said
in a Feb. 22 conference call.  MGM’s average borrowing cost on outstanding debt is 8
percent, “so for every 1 percent improvement in rate that we
can achieve, that’s an incremental $125 million in interest rate
and incremental free  cash flow  to our company,” he said. “As
we go forward, we believe there will be more opportunities to
further reduce these borrowing costs and improve our overall
free cash flow.”  March 2010 Sale  Despite the longer maturity on today’s note, the coupon is
lower than the notes issued in January, Bloomberg data show. In
May 2007, the Las Vegas-based company sold 7.5 percent debt due
in June 2016, the data show.  Speculative-grade yields tumbled to 7.6 percent as of
yesterday from as high as 10.2 percent in October, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  The debt will help pay $965 million owed to term loan
lenders as of March 14 that refused to extend commitments as
well as to pay back other outstanding borrowings, MGM said in a
statement today.  The company extended the maturity on $1.8 billion of loans
to February 2015 while $1.3 billion remains due in February
2014, MGM said in a Feb. 27 regulatory filing.  MGM sold 10-year notes in March 2010, issuing $845 million
of 9 percent senior secured debt at a yield of 5.29 percentage
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The securities traded at 111.75 cents on
the dollar to yield 7 percent as of March 9, according to Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  ‘Constant Issuer’  The casino operator will “need to be a constant issuer”
in the  debt market  as it faces $8.5 billion of maturities in the
next four years, CreditSights Inc. analysts wrote in a March 6
research note.  About 62 percent of holders of MGM’s $3.5 billion credit
facility agreed to push out the due date to Feb. 23, 2015, from
Feb. 21, 2014, the company said in the filing last month.
Lenders that extended can receive a 20 percent reduction in
their credit exposure, according to the filing.  The company’s bonds issued in January were boosted from a
planned $500 million bond sale to $850 million based on demand,
D’Arrigo said in the conference call last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
