Fiat SpA (F)  Chief Executive Officer
 Sergio Marchionne  received compensation totaling 14.5 million
euros ($19 million) in 2011, mostly in stock grants.  Marchionne had a salary of 2.45 million euros by the
Italian carmaker, according to a filing released today.  He also
got stock-related remuneration which had a “fair value” of
12.01 million euros, Fiat said.  “Marchionne’s salary is in line with the industry’s top
managers, and he shares company’s risk with the stock payment,”
said Giuliano Noci, a marketing professor at Milan Polytechnic.
“Industrywide speaking, the difference between top managers’
salary and workers is impressive.”  Marchionne didn’t receive any compensation from Chrysler,
where he is Chairman and CEO, last year. He is also chairman of
Fiat Industrial SpA, a truckmaking unit Fiat spun off last year.
His salary from Fiat Industrial hasn’t been disclosed yet.  Ford Motor Co. awarded Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally
$58.3 million in stock as a reward for the automaker’s
turnaround while  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  Chief Executive Officer  Martin
Winterkorn , who led the world’s second-largest carmaker to a
record profit last year, earned 17.5 million euros to top the
rankings as best-paid CEO in the benchmark DAX Index.  General Motors Co. CEO Dan Akerson, whose pay must be
approved by the Obama administration’s special pay master, said
Jan. 10 that he won’t get a cash bonus for 2011, the year the
Detroit-based automaker earned a record profit and again became
the world’s largest.  Akerson, who served as CEO for four months in 2010,
received $2.53 million in total compensation for that year, GM
said in a proxy statement last year.  Fiat awarded Marchionne stock grants to receive 7 million
shares, the carmaker said Feb. 22. They can be exercised from
2012 to 2015. Marchionne will receive one third of the shares
every year if he remains CEO of the Italian carmaker. The final
payment will be made Feb. 22, 2015 if Marchionne is still in his
post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
