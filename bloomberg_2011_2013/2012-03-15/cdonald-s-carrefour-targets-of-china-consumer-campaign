McDonald’s Corp. (MCD)  sold chicken wings
past their sell-by period and  Carrefour SA (CA)  mislabeled chicken at
Chinese outlets, state-owned  China Central Television  reported.  A Beijing branch of McDonald’s, the world’s largest
restaurant chain, also changed production time-stamps on pies
past their expiration period, selling them to customers instead
of throwing them away, according CCTV’s investigation aired
yesterday.  “This is an isolated case,” said Sophia Luan, a China
spokeswoman for McDonald’s. The company will investigate the
matter and give all employees training again on food-handling
guidelines to ensure product safety and quality, she said.  China’s State Food and Drug Administration today asked
McDonald’s China unit to inspect  food safety  in all of its
restaurants in  China , according to a statement posted on the
regulator’s website today. It asked McDonald’s to apologize to
Chinese consumers.  Carrefour, the world’s second-largest retailer, mislabeled
ordinary chicken as a premium type and sold it for higher prices
at an outlet in Zhengzhou in central China’s Henan province,
CCTV reported in a broadcast marking the nation’s annual
consumer-rights day.  The supermarket outlet also changed labels giving the
production date of meat, according to the report.  Carrefour issued “a sincere apology” to customers on its
verified account on Sina Corp.’s Weibo microblog service in
response to the CCTV program. The company pays attention to
misbehavior in handling raw food and will investigate, according
to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
