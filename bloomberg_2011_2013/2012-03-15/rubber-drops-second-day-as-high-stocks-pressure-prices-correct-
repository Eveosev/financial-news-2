(Corrects conversion in second paragraph.)  Rubber declined for a second day on
concern that high stockpiles in China, the world’s biggest
consumer, and in  Thailand  will continue to pressure prices.  The August-delivery contract fell as much as 1 percent to
333.9 yen a kilogram ($3,989 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, before trading at 336.3 yen at 11:12 a.m.
local time. The most-active contract has surged 28 percent this
year.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  this month announced an economic growth
target of 7.5 percent for this year, down from 8 percent over
the past seven years. Natural-rubber inventories totaled 28,194
tons on March 8, based on a survey of nine warehouses in
Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the Shanghai
Futures Exchange said. That compared with last year’s low of
10,291 tons.  “High levels of rubber inventories in  China  raises
concerns that import demand may slow,” said Chaiwat Muenmee,
analyst at Bangkok-based commodity broker DS Futures Co.
Abundant supplies from Thai operators are also weighing on
prices, he said.  Declines may be limited as a weakening yen improved the
appeal of the yen-denominated contracts, Gu Jiong, an analyst at
commodity broker Yutaka Shoji, said by phone from Tokyo.  Japanese stocks advanced for a third day as the yen’s drop
to an 11-month low against the dollar buoyed earnings prospects
for exporters. Stocks gained as the yen reached 84.02 against
the dollar today, its lowest since April 13. The currency has
weakened on the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s expansion of its asset-purchase
program and signs of recovery in the U.S. BOJ Governor  Masaaki
Shirakawa  signaled on March 13 that additional bond purchases
aren’t off the table.  May-delivery rubber in Shanghai dropped 0.2 percent to
28,805 yuan ($4,550) a ton. The Thai cash price remained
unchanged at 124.05 baht ($4.05) a kilogram yesterday, the
Rubber Research Institute of Thailand said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
