Singapore’s companies added more
jobs than initially estimated last quarter, pushing the
 unemployment rate  to a 14-year low in 2011.  Employers increased payrolls by 37,600 in the three months
through December, compared with a January estimate of 36,300,
the  Ministry of Manpower  said in a statement today. The
 unemployment rate  averaged 2 percent last year, it said.  The government has cut taxes in recent years to encourage
companies to set up operations or expand in the Southeast Asian
nation as it faces competition from neighbors including
Indonesia and  Malaysia  in attracting investment. Singapore’s
economy shrank for the second time in three quarters in the
three months ended December as manufacturing eased, increasing
pressure on policy makers to spur growth.  “With the economic outlook uncertain, hiring sentiments have
continued to soften,” the government said today.  Productivity slipped 0.4 percent last quarter, the ministry
said. Average wages before adjusting for inflation rose 4
percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
