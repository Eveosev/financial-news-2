Civil-society organizations in
Malawi said they would call on companies to strike unless
President Bingu wa Mutharika resigns or calls a referendum to
gauge his popularity within 90 days.  They also called on the government of the southern African
nation to devalue the local currency, the kwacha, saying that
the official rate of 165 per dollar is overvalued compared with
the black-market rate of 300.  “We want the president to resign honorably within 90 days
or if he thinks he is still popular, he should call for a
referendum within the 90 days,” said Margaret Ali, vice
chairperson of Human Rights Consultative Committee, a non-
governmental organization, citing recommendations by
organizations after a two-day conference in Blantyre. “Failure
to follow this will call for mass action.”  Malawi is facing a political and economic crisis after some
donors withheld aid last year after a crackdown by the
government against protesters amid calls for changes to economic
policy to end fuel and foreign-currency shortages. The southern
African nation devalued the kwacha by 10 percent on Aug. 8  The currency was unchanged at 165.85 per dollar at 5:55
p.m. in Blantyre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
