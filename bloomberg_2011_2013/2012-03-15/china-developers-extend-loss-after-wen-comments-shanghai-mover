China ’s property stocks extended
declines after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the country’s home prices
are far from a reasonable level, denting hopes real estate curbs
will be eased.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) ’s measure of property shares
dropped 1.5 percent as of 10:30 a.m., the largest decline among
the five industry groups on the benchmark gauge. The property
index is set for the biggest two-day drop since August.  China
Vanke Co. (000002) , the country’s biggest developer by sales, fell 2.2
percent to a two-week low in Shenzhen trading.  Poly Real Estate
Group Co. (6000048)  dropped 1.9 percent to the lowest since Feb. 21.  China must not slacken efforts in regulating the housing
sector and relaxing curbs could cause “chaos” in the market,
Wen said at a press conference in Beijing yesterday. A burst
property bubble would hurt the entire economy, and the
government wants “long-term steady and sound growth” in
housing, he said.  “Hopes of a quick loosening are dashed,” wrote Alan Jin,
a Hong Kong-based analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd., in a
note to clients today. “It is unlikely for the central
government to send out a clear loosening signal to the market
any time soon.”  Chinese developers traded in  Hong Kong  made half of the
biggest declines on the MSCI China Index.  China Resources Land
Ltd. (3383) , a state-owned developer, fell 2.6 percent to HK$13.40, the
lowest in two months.  Country Garden Holdings Co. (2007)  dropped the
most in two weeks, losing 3.6 percent to HK$3.24.  --Bonnie Cao. Editors: Andreea Papuc, Malcolm Scott  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
