The  Federal Reserve  is intruding on
bank discretion by using stress test results in assessing plans
for capital distribution, said Ernest Patrikis, a partner at
White & Case LLP and a former New York Fed general counsel.  “It’s almost treating banks like they are public
utilities,” Patrikis said today in a radio interview on “The
Hays Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays  and Vonnie Quinn.  To contact the reporters on this story:
