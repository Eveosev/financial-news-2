Russian billionaire Gennady
Timchenko and OAO Gazprombank plan to buy half of Petromir, the
license holder of an East Siberian natural-gas deposit, from OAO
Stroytransgaz, the engineering firm they control,  Vedomosti 
said, citing an unidentified person.  Stroytransgaz will sell its half of Petromir to help repay
debt to Gazprombank, Vedomosti said, citing the person. The
pipeline-building company had 34.8 billion rubles ($1.2 billion)
of loans outstanding at the beginning of the year, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
