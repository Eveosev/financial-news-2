Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  shoppers will
get an eight-hour head start in buying Apple Inc.’s new iPad.  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, will sell a limited
number of iPads starting at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow, the
Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said in an e-mailed
statement today. Apple retail outlets are due to start selling
the new tablet when they open, at 8:00 a.m.  The new iPad, unveiled last week, sports a high-resolution
screen and stronger processor. Apple typically doesn’t favor
other retailers over its own chain of more than 350 outlets. The
arrangement also gives Wal-Mart a jump on such rivals as  Target
Corp. (TGT)  and  Best Buy Co. (BBY)   Wal-Mart will sell models with 16 gigabytes of memory and
Wi-Fi Web access.  The iPad accounted for about 20 percent of Apple’s sales
last quarter, making it the company’s second best-selling
product by revenue behind the iPhone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
