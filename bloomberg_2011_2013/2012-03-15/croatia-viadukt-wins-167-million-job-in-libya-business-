Viadukt d.d. , a Croatian
construction company, won a 128 million-euro ($167 million) deal
to build a road in  Libya , Business.hr reported, citing Tomislav
Strbac, an executive at the company.  The job, agreed in 2008 and stopped by the unrest in the
country last year, will go ahead after the Libyan government
approved the budget for this year, the Zagreb-based newspaper
 said  on its website today.  Viadukt will construct a 320-kilometer (199 miles) stretch
of the road in the western part of the country between the
cities of Nalut and Ghadames, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
