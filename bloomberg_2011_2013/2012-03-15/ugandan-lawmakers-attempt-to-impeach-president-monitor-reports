Two Ugandan opposition lawmakers
started a petition to impeach President  Yoweri Museveni ,
accusing him of abuse of office, the  Daily Monitor  reported.  Odonga Otto of the Forum for Democratic Change and the
 Conservative Party ’s Ken Lukyamuzi have garnered seven
signatures for the petition so far, the Kampala-based newspaper
said. At least one-third of the Ugandan parliament’s 386 members
must sign the petition for it to progress, the Monitor said.  The two lawmakers’ accusations against Museveni include
diverting 100 billion shillings ($41 million) of foreign aid to
buy a presidential jet and allowing the country’s external debt
to increase to $4 billion, it said.  Information Minister Mary Karooro Okurut described the plan
to impeach the president as “an aimless walk in the political
desert,” the newspaper quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
