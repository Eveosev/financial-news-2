Peyton Manning visited the
Tennessee Titans’ headquarters as he hunts for a new team after
being cut by the  Indianapolis Colts  following 14 years and four
Most Valuable Player awards, the  Associated Press  reported.  Manning met with coach Mike Munchak, General Manager Ruston
Webster and Chief Operating Officer Mike Reinfeldt, AP said.  The 35-year-old quarterback earlier held talks with the
Denver Broncos, Arizona Cardinals and  Miami Dolphins .  The Titans’ team doctor was among those meeting with
Manning, AP said. Manning missed the last National Football
League season after having at least three operations on his neck.  The record four-time NFL MVP was cut after 14 years with
the  Colts, where he won a Super Bowl title. The decision came a
day before Indianapolis would have had to pay him a $28 million
bonus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
