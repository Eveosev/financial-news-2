Azerbaijani consumer prices rose
3.7 percent from a year earlier in the first two months of 2012
as food and services costs increased, the State Statistics
Committee said today on its website.  Inflation in the energy-rich Caspian Sea nation was 7.9
percent last year. Prices will advance less than 10 percent in
2012, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
