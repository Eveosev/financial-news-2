EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s PayPal division, aiming
to get cab drivers and small merchants to use its payment
system, unveiled a new card-swiping device that scans checks and
works with all four major credit-card networks.  The reader, which plugs into a smartphone, can accept
payments from  Visa Inc. (V) , MasterCard Inc.,  Discover Financial
Services (DFS)  and American Express Co. cards, PayPal said today at an
event in San Francisco. The device also can let retailers get
delayed payments by sending out invoices, and it encrypts
account information so credit-card data isn’t stored on phones.  The product helps PayPal extend its foothold in e-commerce
transactions into the brick-and-mortar world by making it easier
for merchants to use its technology. The company will give away
the thumb-sized card reader, called PayPal Here, and provide the
accompanying smartphone app for free. EBay then makes money by
charging a rate of 2.7 percent on transactions.  “We are one of if not the lowest-cost provider,” John Donahoe, chief executive officer of EBay and interim president
of PayPal, said in an interview. “We try to see where the world
is going and create products to fit that.”  The company has been investing in data centers, software
and talent to handle an increased volume of payments -- expected
to reach $7 billion on mobile devices this year, Donahoe said.
He doesn’t plan to change the pace of takeovers --  more than 10 
in the past year -- and is keeping an eye out for ways to bridge
the company’s online and offline products.  Competing With Square  EBay shares fell 2.1 percent to $36.83 at the close in  New
York . The stock has climbed 21 percent this year.  PayPal Here will compete with a product from Square Inc., a
San Francisco startup begun by Twitter Inc. co-founder Jack Dorsey. Square’s reader, which also accepts all major credit
cards, charges a slightly higher rate -- 2.75 percent. Still,
its product was introduced in 2010, and reached 100 million
users in December.  PayPal first gained popularity as a way for small e-
commerce sites to accept payment without the expense or hassle
of processing credit cards. The new device will help PayPal
compete in the market for mobile payments, which may top $170
billion in transactions by 2015, up from about $60 billion last
year, according to  Juniper Research .  ‘Ubiquitous Acceptance’  In addition to Square,  Intuit Inc. (INTU)  and VeriFone Systems
Inc. also offer devices that let consumers pay with credit cards
over their mobile phones.  “This is about getting ubiquitous acceptance of PayPal and
bringing small retailers into the fold,”  Gil Luria , an analyst
at Wedbush Securities Inc. in  Los Angeles , said yesterday.  To create the card reader, PayPal worked with  Fuseproject ,
a San Francisco-based design firm founded by Yves Behar, people
familiar with the situation said. Fuseproject also designed the
Jawbone line of Bluetooth headsets and low-cost computers for
One Laptop per Child.  PayPal is going after a larger network of companies, big
and small. That includes rolling out its payment service to in-
store terminals at U.S.  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  locations.  The company is talking to the top 200 U.S. retailers and
has persuaded a “significant” number in that group to sign
contracts to accept PayPal in their stores, former President
 Scott Thompson  said in December -- before he left to become
chief executive officer of Yahoo Inc.  PayPal’s Growth  PayPal, EBay’s fastest-growing unit, has helped fuel a
comeback at the  San Jose , California-based parent company, where
sales increased 27 percent last year to $11.7 billion. Still,
revenue growth at the payments division slowed last quarter, to
28 percent from 32 percent in the previous period.  PayPal is working to boost sales through multiple channels,
not just through mobile phones, Donahoe said. The company is
betting that accepting all payment types and card providers will
get consumers in the door and eventually let it gain market
share.  “I don’t see this as zero sum with Visa or Mastercard,”
Donahoe said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
