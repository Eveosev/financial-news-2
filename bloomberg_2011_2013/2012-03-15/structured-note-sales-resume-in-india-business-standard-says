Indian issuers have resumed selling
principal-protected structured notes after a hiatus of about
four months that followed the introduction of new regulations,
 the Business Standard reported  yesterday.  The  Securities and Exchange Board of India , the country’s
regulator,  required  daily valuation of products in September.
That led to a halt in issuance of the securities, the report
cited Prateek Pant, head of wealth solutions at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc’s private banking business, as saying.  Pant said that because Indian rating company Crisil Ltd. is
offering a valuation service, product issuance had resumed,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
