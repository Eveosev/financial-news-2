A Wisconsin court’s ruling that the
state’s voter identification law is unconstitutional will be
appealed to the state  Supreme Court , Wisconsin Attorney General
J.B. Van Hollen told an appellate panel.  State Circuit Court Judge Richard G. Niess in Madison on
March 12 invalidated the law, which requires otherwise eligible
voters to present a government-issued photo identification such
as a driver’s license, U.S. passport, or college or armed forces
ID before being permitted to cast their ballots. Niess barred
its enforcement.  Another judge in the state’s capital city, David Flanagan,
issued an order temporarily blocking the measure on March 6. The
attorney general said yesterday he wanted expedited reviews of
both rulings. He also asked Niess to delay enforcement of his
order during the appeal.  “Both of these cases involve novel constitutional
challenges to the voter ID law,”  Van Hollen  said in a
statement. “Due to the important statewide legal and policy
issues at stake, defendants are suggesting in their filings
today that certification of both cases to the Supreme Court
would be appropriate.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
