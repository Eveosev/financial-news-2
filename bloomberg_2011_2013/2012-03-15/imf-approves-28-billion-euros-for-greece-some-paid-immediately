The  International Monetary Fund 
approved a 28 billion-euro ($36.6 billion) loan for  Greece  as
part of a second bailout with the euro area that requires more
austerity and steps up controls over the country’s spending.  The Washington-based IMF said 1.65 billion euros will be
immediately available under the new arrangement. The four-year
loan announced today follows an earlier program that was
cancelled, leaving 9.7 billion euros that was never disbursed.  Greece completed the world’s largest-ever sovereign-debt
restructuring and had to agree to deeper spending cuts to obtain
the new public funds. Global risks posed by the European crisis
diminished after euro area members this week approved a second
bailout for Greece.  While the conditions attached to the loan may prove hard to
meet amid a fifth year of recession and upcoming elections,
European officials are counting on the 130 billion-euro package
to buy some time to insulate the rest of the region from the
debt crisis, said Domenico Lombardi, a senior fellow at the
 Brookings Institution  in  Washington .  “The main function of this agreement is to contain the
crisis for the next few months in order to provide a more stable
environment for Italy and  Spain  to carry out their adjustments
and therefore stabilize the euro area as a whole” said
Lombardi, a former IMF board official.  The agreement, formally approved by euro countries
yesterday, caps months of negotiations over a second package
after an initial rescue in 2010 failed to halt the debt turmoil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
