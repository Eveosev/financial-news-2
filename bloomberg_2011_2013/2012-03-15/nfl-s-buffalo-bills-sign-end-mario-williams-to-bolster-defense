The  Buffalo Bills  signed Pro Bowl
player Mario Williams to a six-year contact, adding the former
top pick in the National Football League draft to a defense that
ranked 26th last season.  The contract contains a guarantee of $50 million, a record
for a defensive player, Williams’s agent, Ben Dogra, told the
Associated Press. Williams account on the Twitter social media
site displayed a Bills’ helmet.  The 27-year-old defensive end totaled 53 sacks in 82 games
and earned two Pro Bowl selections since being selected by the
Houston Texans with the first pick in 2006. He only played in
five games last year due to a torn pectoral muscle.  Williams joins a defense that was once home to Bruce Smith,
an 11-time Pro Bowl selection who earned a place in Canton,
 Ohio ’s Pro Football Hall of Fame during 19 seasons with the
Bills and  Washington Redskins .  To contact the reporter on this story:
