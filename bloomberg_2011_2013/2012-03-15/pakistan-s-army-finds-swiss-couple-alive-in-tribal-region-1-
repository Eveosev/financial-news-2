A Swiss couple abducted by Taliban
guerrillas in July were found alive in  Pakistan ’s tribal region
of North Waziristan, the military said in a statement.  They were flown to the northwestern city of  Peshawar  by
helicopter after turning up at a check-post, the army said in
the statement. North Waziristan is home to several militant
groups fighting American forces in neighboring Afghanistan.  Pakistani media, including the Geo television channel,
broadcast a video of the couple they said was released by the
Taliban last year.  The New York Times reported in January that militants
holding the Swiss had demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a
Pakistani neuroscientist sentenced to 86 years in jail in 2010
for trying to kill American soldiers and Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents while in custody at a police station in
 Afghanistan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
