Sharp Corp. replaces Katsuhiko Machida 
with Takashi Okuda as president after a record annual loss. 
Fallout continues after a  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  executive 
resigned and wrote a scathing criticism of the bank. Analysts 
downgraded  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293)  after it lowered 
dividends and forecast a challenging 2012. (Source: Bloomberg)  Running Time: 02:47
