China Overseas Land & Investment
Ltd. (688) , the country’s biggest developer by market value listed in
 Hong Kong , said 2011 profit growth slowed as the Chinese
government introduced measures to cool the property market.  Net income  rose 22 percent to HK$15.03 billion ($1.9
billion), or HK$1.84 a share, from HK$12.4 billion, or $HK1.51 a
share, a year earlier, the company said in a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing today. That compares with the HK$12.7 billion
average  estimate  of 17 analysts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. Sales rose 9.6 percent to HK$48.6 billion from
HK$44.3 billion.  China  Overseas’ earnings growth slowed from 66 percent in
2010 after the government last year expanded efforts to control
the  property market  including raising down-payment and mortgage
requirements and imposing home purchase restrictions in about 40
cities. Property prices are far from returning to reasonable
levels, therefore China must not relax controls on real estate
prices, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in Beijing yesterday.  “The developer’s profit growth slowed because the
company’s focus of mid-and-high end homes were more or less
affected by the government’s property measures as its sales were
not as brilliant as before,” said Peter Bai, a Beijing-based
property analyst at China International Capital Corp., the
country’s biggest investment bank, before today’s release. “But
big companies like China Overseas are still doing better than
peer developers in a bad market.”  Market Change  Profit excluding revalutions increased by 37 percent to
HK$13.02 billion yuan from 2010.  The Hong Kong-traded stock  fell 2.7 percent to HK$15.36 at
local close, the lowest in two weeks. The drop pared its gain
this year to 18 percent, compared with a 20 percent increase in
the  Hang Seng Property Index (HSP) , which tracks the seven-biggest
Hong Kong-listed builders including China Overseas.  “Going to the second half of the year, the market
environment changed rapidly. The group is still fully confident
about long-term development of the mainland China property
market,” Chairman Kong Qingping said in today’s statement. The
company will “calmly meet the challenges ahead.”  ‘Remain Challenging’  The developer’s contracted sales rose 42 percent in the
first two months of this year from the same period in 2011 to
HK$17.1 billion, it said in an e-mailed statement on March 13.
Hong Kong and Chinese developers begin selling properties while
they’re still in construction and book profit upon completion.  The company sold a total of HK$87.1 billion worth of
properties during 2011, up 29.8 percent from a year earlier, it
said today. That was compared with 40.4 percent growth in 2010.  “The market will remain challenging in the first half of
the year,” Kong told reporters in Hong Kong today. “We will be
cautious when approaching new projects.”  The developer set the sales target for at least HK$80
billion for 2012, it said in the statement today.  Operating Profit  China Overseas, which  builds  homes and offices in 25 cities
in the mainland, said operating profit from its property
development business in China rose 13.1 percent to HK$18.5
billion, accounting for 79 percent of the group’s total profit.  The company is studying plans to invest in foreign property
markets through its parent, Chairman Kong said in an interview
in Beijing on March 5. It is looking at office markets in the
U.S.,  London ,  Europe ,  Taiwan  and  Southeast Asia , with a rental
return ratio of around 4 percent to 5 percent per year, Kong
said.  The developer bought 20 parcels of land with a total gross
floor area of 9.1 million square meters (98 million square feet)
during the year, it said.  Property markets in Hong Kong and Macau will undergo some
adjustment, but the high-end segment that the company operates
in will be little affected, Kong said in the statement.  The company will pay a final  dividend  of 20 Hong Kong cents
per share, compared with 17 Hong Kong cents a year earlier.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
