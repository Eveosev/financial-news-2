Egypt  raised the targeted 7 billion
Egyptian pounds ($1.2 billion) from the sale of treasury bills
as yields fell to the lowest in more than a month before an
International Monetary Fund visit next week. Dollar bonds rose.  The North African country accepted bids for 3.5 billion
pounds each of  six-  and  12-month (EGTBY12)  notes, according to central
bank data on Bloomberg. The average yield on six-month bills
fell five basis points from last weekâ€™s sale to 14.819 percent,
the lowest level since Jan. 19. The one-year rate fell two basis
points to 15.919 percent, the lowest since an auction on Feb. 2.  Surging yields had forced the government to fall 23 percent
short of the 118.5 billion pounds it targeted in the first two
months of the year, according to finance ministry  data . Yields
on the bills have leveled off in the past month after surging by
more than 2 percentage points on nine-month and one-year
securities since October.  An advance team from the IMF will arrive in Cairo on March
18, Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed said this week. The
government has requested a $3.2 billion loan from the fund.  The 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April 2020 advanced for a
sixth day. The yield dropped five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 6.43 percent at 1:26 p.m. in Cairo, the
lowest level since Nov. 18, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Egyptian pound was little changed at 6.0339 a dollar,
having lost 1.8 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
