U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index above 1,400 for the first time since
2008, as reports on manufacturing and jobless claims bolstered
optimism in the economy. Treasuries trimmed losses.  The S&P 500 climbed 0.6 percent to close at 1,402.6 at 4
p.m. in  New York  and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  gained
58.66 points to 13,252.76, its highest close since December
2007. The 10-year Treasury  yield  added one basis point to 2.28
percent after gaining as much as eight basis points. Crude pared
losses as an Obama official denied a report the U.S. and U.K.
planned to release oil from strategic reserves.  Nine of 10  industries  in the S&P 500 advanced as U.S.
jobless claims matched the lowest level in four years and
manufacturing in the New York region expanded at the fastest
pace since June 2010. Other reports showed  consumer confidence 
climbed to the highest level since 2008 and international demand
for U.S. financial assets increased more than forecast.  “The stock market is not terribly cheap, but reasonably

“We’re still in attractive area for long-term investors. The
economy is steadily improving. If people focus on that, we might
see some further strength in share prices.”  Valuation Watch  The  S&P 500  is trading for about  14.5 times  its companies
reported earnings, the highest valuation since July while still
below the five-decade average multiple of 16.4. Financials,
commodity producers and industrial companies led gains among the

2009.  Oil Reverses  Oil slipped 0.3 percent to $105.11 a barrel today, the

rising gasoline prices.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  closed up 0.3 percent, erasing

the dollar.  The  International Monetary Fund  approved a 28 billion-euro
($36.6 billion) loan for  Greece  as part of a second bailout with
the euro area that requires more austerity and steps up controls
over the country’s spending. The Washington-based IMF said 1.65
billion euros will be immediately available under the new
arrangement.  The Swiss franc strengthened 0.9 percent against the dollar
