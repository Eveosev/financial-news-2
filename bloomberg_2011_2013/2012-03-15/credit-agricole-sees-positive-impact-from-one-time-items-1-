Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , France’s third-
largest bank, said gains from buying back its own debt will more
than compensate for the impact of additional Greek provisions on
first-quarter earnings.  Credit Agricole , owner of the unprofitable Athens-based
Emporiki Bank of Greece SA, is booking 130 million euros ($170
million) in first-quarter writedowns on Emporiki’s residual
deferred-tax assets, as well as writing down 415 million euros
of debt from three Greek companies by 74 percent, according to a
statement today.  The Greek losses will be more than offset by about 550
million euros in gains from subordinated-debt buybacks, the bank
said.  “Globally, the impact on the first quarter is going to be
slightly positive,” said Charlotte de Chavagnac, a spokeswoman
at the Montrouge, France-based bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
