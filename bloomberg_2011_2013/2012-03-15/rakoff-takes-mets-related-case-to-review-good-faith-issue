U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff
agreed to take over a $100 million case related to a lawsuit by
the bankruptcy trustee for  Bernard Madoff ’s former firm against
the owners of the  New York Mets , saying he would examine what
standard the trustee must meet to show that the defendants
didn’t withdraw money from the Madoff brokerage in “good
faith,” according to a court order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
