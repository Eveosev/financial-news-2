The best-performing real estate
investment trusts this year will be owners of office and
industrial properties, as occupancies improve and landlords
raise rents, a  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  analyst said.  Commercial real estate has “turned the corner,” helping
REITs improve earnings and have “robust dividend growth,”
Anthony Paolone said today in an interview on Bloomberg Radio’s
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and Ken Prewitt.  Demand for industrial and office space is improving as the
U.S. economy expands and  hiring  picks up. The vacancy rate for
industrial properties fell to 10 percent at the end of 2011 from
10.8 percent a year earlier, according to Cushman & Wakefield
Inc. New York and Washington had the lowest office vacancy rates
in the fourth quarter, the commercial-property brokerage said.  Companies such as  SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG) , the biggest owner
of Manhattan skyscrapers, and  Prologis Inc. (PLD) , the world’s largest
warehouse landlord, are the “best buys” among REIT stocks, he
said.  “Occupancy is moving higher and rent rolls are starting to
move,” Paolone said. “There is some leverage for an economic
recovery.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
