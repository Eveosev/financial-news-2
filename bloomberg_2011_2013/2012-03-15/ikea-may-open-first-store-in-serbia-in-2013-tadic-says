Ikea Group, the world’s largest
furniture retailer, is “ready to open” its first store in
 Serbia  by the end of 2013, Serbian President  Boris Tadic  said.  The new outlet would mark the return of the Swedish
company, which had a smaller store in the capital Belgrade in
1991 and closed it after the outbreak of violence that
accompanied the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.  Ikea plans to open a total of five stores in Serbia in the
future and is in the process of obtaining permits to build the
first one in Belgrade “as soon as possible” after it resolves
“all administrative procedures,” Tadic said according to a
statement issued by his office after a meeting with Ikea’s Chief
Executive Officer Mikael Ohlsson in Belgrade today.  Ikea cooperates well with the Serbian authorities and has
“got a confirmation that all administrative procedures will be
completed efficiently and as quickly as possible,” Milena
Vujicic, public relations manager for Ikea Southeast
 Europe , said an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
