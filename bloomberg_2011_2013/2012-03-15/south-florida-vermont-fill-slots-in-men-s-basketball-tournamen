The University of Vermont and the
University of  South Florida  won to set up the first full round
of play in the men’s college basketball national tournament.  Vermont (24-11) won 71-59 over  Lamar University (81040MF)  last night,
advancing to a spot tomorrow against the University of  North
Carolina , the top seed in the National Collegiate Athletic
Association’s Midwest Region.  South Florida (21-13) won 65-54 over the University of
California-Berkeley (24-10) in last night’s other game in Dayton,
 Ohio , and moved on to face Temple University tomorrow in the
Midwest Region.  The 68-team tournament began two days ago with the first
two of four games to decide the last contestants in the first
full round, which starts today.  The University of  Kentucky  (32-2), the No. 1 seed in the
tournament, takes on Western Kentucky in the South Region in
Louisville, Kentucky. Western Kentucky got the No. 16 regional
seed when it won in the first round two days ago and at 16-18 is
the only team in the tournament with a losing record.  Syracuse University (31-2), the top seed in the East Region,
meets No. 16 North Carolina-Asheville (24-9) in Pittsburgh.
Syracuse will be without center Fab Melo, the Big East
Conference Defensive Player of the Year, who was declared
ineligible this week. No reason was given for the ban. Melo had
been barred for three games this season for academic reasons.  Since 1985, No. 1-seeded teams have a 104-0 record in the
tournament against 16th-seeded teams.  Harvard Opens  Harvard University , the Ivy League champion and in the
tournament for the first time since 1946, plays Vanderbilt
University in  Albuquerque , New Mexico, in an East Region opener.  President  Barack Obama , a graduate of Harvard Law School,
picked Vanderbilt, the region’s fifth seed, to beat the 12th-
seeded Crimson, coached by Tommy Amaker.  “The amount of excitement that that’s generated obviously
is terrific,” Obama said of Harvard’s qualification during the
opening game of the tournament two days ago, which he attended
with U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron . “How far they can go is
another question but for them to be able to make it, I know
Tommy Amaker is real proud.”  In 68 NCAA tournament appearances, Ivy League teams have a
40-78 record. Since 2000, the league has gone 2-12. Vanderbilt,
is 9-13 all-time in NCAA tournament play. A year ago, Vanderbilt
was a fifth seed and lost its opening game to No. 12 Richmond
69-66.  Freshman Four McGlynn came off the bench to score 18 points
last night for  Vermont , which shot 50 percent from the floor and
held Lamar to 33 percent shooting. Devon Lamb and Mike James had
16 points each for the Cardinals (23-12), who are coached by Pat Knight, the son of Hall of Fame coach Bob Knight.  Victor Rudd Jr. had 15 points to lead the South Florida
Bulls. Reserve Harper Kamp had 19 points and seven rebounds to
lead the Golden Bears.  The Final Four, the national semifinals, is scheduled for
March 31 at the Louisiana Superdome in  New Orleans , with the
title game two days later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
