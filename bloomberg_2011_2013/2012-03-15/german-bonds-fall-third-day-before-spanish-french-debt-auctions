German government notes fell for a
third day as demand for Spanish notes increased at an auction,
sapping investor appetite for the euro-region’s safest assets.  Germany ’s  30-year yields  rose to the highest this year.
 Spain  sold 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion) of securities due
between 2015 and 2018 today and  France  auctioned about 10
billion euros of debt. The Spanish sale was the first since
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  raised the country’s 2012 deficit
target on March 2.  Today’s Spanish sale “was a test for demand, to check if
it was still solid despite worries about the country’s fiscal
consolidation,” said Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at
Newedge Group in London. “It was still a good result.”  The German five-year yield climbed four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 0.97 percent at 4 p.m.  London  time,
after reaching 0.98 percent, the highest since Feb. 9. The 0.75
percent bond due February 2017 dropped 0.180, or 1.80 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 99.950.  The  30-year (GDBRG30)  yield was little changed at 2.63 percent after
earlier reaching 2.68 percent, the highest level since Dec. 12.
Ten-year yields were also little changed, at 1.96 percent.  Spain sold 976 million euros of 3.25 percent notes due
April 2016 at an average yield of 3.37 percent. The bid-to-cover
ratio was 4.13, compared with 2.21 when the notes were sold in
January, the Bank of Spain said in  Madrid  today. It also
auctioned 2015 and 2018 securities. The maximum target for all
three auctions was 3.5 billion euros.  Spanish Deficit  European finance chiefs told Spain earlier this week to
prune an additional 0.5 percent of gross domestic product out of
the 2012 budget after Rajoy set a deficit goal of 5.8 percent.
Such a target “is dead,” Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said after chairing a meeting of euro-area finance
ministers in Brussels.  Spain sold less than the maximum because it “has already
funded about 40 percent of its requirement this year and might
hold for benchmark auctions, which are cheaper, to sell more,”
Piazza said.  France sold 3.26 billion euros of benchmark five-year debt
at an average yield of 1.78 percent. The borrowing cost for the
1.75 percent note due in February 2017 was less than the yield
of 1.93 percent at the previous sale of the securities on Feb.
16. In addition to bonds due in 2014 and 2015, the nation also
auctioned 1.6 billion euros of inflation-linked debt maturing
between 2019 and 2027.  Spreads Widen  Yields on Spanish two-year notes four basis points lower at
2.41 percent after sliding to 2.38 percent.  French  government bonds  fell, pushing the 10-year yield up
four basis points to 2.97 percent. The nation’s two-year yield
rose two basis points to 0.54 percent.  The extra yield, or spread, investors demand to hold
Spanish 10-year debt rather than similar-maturity Italian
securities rose to as much as 33 basis points, the most since
July 26 based on closing prices.  The Italian securities yielded 202 basis points more than
their Spanish counterparts on Dec. 30. The two-year spread is 44
basis points.  German bonds have lost 0.7 percent so far this year after
returning 9.7 percent in 2011, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Spanish securities have gained 2 percent and French
debt 1.9 percent, the data show.  Bund Futures  The extra yield investors receive from holding  U.S. 10-year
notes (USGG10YR)  instead of similar-maturity German debt increased to as
much as 39 basis points, before paring to 33 basis points.
That’s the most since Feb. 21, 2011, based on closing price data
compiled by Bloomberg.  German bund futures may fall as much as 0.9 percent after
breaking below a key area of support, Commerzbank AG said,
citing trading patterns.  The contracts are poised to decline toward 135.20, the Feb.
9 low, after breaching the 11-month uptrend at 137.37 and the
55-day moving average at 137.23,  Axel Rudolph , a senior
technical analyst at the bank in London, said in a phone
interview.  The 10-year bund contract expiring in June fell 0.2 percent
to 136.76 after dropping to 136.26, the lowest level since Feb.
