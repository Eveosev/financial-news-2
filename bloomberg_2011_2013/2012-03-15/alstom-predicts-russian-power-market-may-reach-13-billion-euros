Alstom SA (ALO) , the French maker of
turbines and trains, expects the market for power equipment in
Russia and the  Commonwealth of Independent States  to reach as
much as 13 billion euros ($17 billion) annually.  New builds of coal-fired, gas-fired, nuclear and hydro
plants and wind farms may represent 7 gigawatts a year through
2015, about twice the annual average from 2009 to 2011, the
company based near Paris said in a presentation today.  “For the power generation market, it’s a 12 billion to 13
billion euro market,” including maintenance and retrofit of the
installed base, Denis Cochet, head of sales and marketing at
Alstom, said at an analyst meeting today. For new builds alone,
the 7 gigawatt market may represent “around 9 to 10 billion
euros.”  Alstom has formed a joint venture with Russian nuclear
equipment maker Rosatom Corp.’s Atomenergomash and partnerships
with makers of hydro, power-grid and rail equipment to tap
rising infrastructure needs before the 2014 Winter Olympics and
the 2018 World Cup soccer tournament, and as the country boosts
exports of raw materials.  Alstom has 400 million euros of revenue in  Russia  and the
Commonwealth of Independent States in the April to December
period, and the order intake amounted to 1 billion euros, the
company said.  Alstom may benefit from potential nuclear plant orders won
by Rosatom inside and outside Russia in coming years, Chief
Executive Officer Patrick Kron said today. Alstom may form a
venture to make some components of gas turbines in Russia,
though having a “full-fledged partner to sell large F-class gas
turbines in Russia is today not on the agenda,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
