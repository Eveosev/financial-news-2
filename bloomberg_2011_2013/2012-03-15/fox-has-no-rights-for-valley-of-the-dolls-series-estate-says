News Corp. (NWSA) ’s  Twentieth Century Fox
Film (2888A)  unit doesn’t have the rights for a “Valley of the Dolls”
television series it is developing, the estate of the late
novelist Jacqueline Susann said in a lawsuit.  Fox, which obtained the rights for the 1967 movie, which
became a cult classic, and a 1981 TV movie based on the novel,
doesn’t have the rights for a television series it is developing
with Lee Daniels, the director of “Precious,” according to a
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in  Los Angeles  by
Tiger LLC, the manager of Susann’s estate.  The estate accuses Fox of copyright infringement, breach of
contract, among other claims, and seeks unspecified damages.  Entertainment news website Deadline Hollywood reported in
September that  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBC had bought the project that
Daniels is set to write and direct from Fox.  Chris Petrikin, a spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox Film
in Los Angeles, didn’t have an immediate comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Tiger LLC v. Twentieth Century Fox Film,
12-2183, U.S. District Court, Central District of  California
