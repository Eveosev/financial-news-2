Afghan President  Hamid Karzai  told
visiting U.S. Defense Secretary  Leon Panetta  that American
forces must leave rural areas of Afghanistan, withdrawing to
major bases, according to a statement from Karzai’s office.  “International troops should leave their bases in rural
areas and villages and consolidate in their main bases,” Karzai
said, according to the Pashto-language announcement posted on
the Afghan presidency’s website today. While Karzai attached no
deadline to the demand, he said “Afghan forces have the ability
to ensure security in rural areas and villages,” according to
the statement.  “Both sides should work together to complete the process
of Afghanistan’s security transition from international troops
to Afghan forces in 2013 instead of 2014,” the statement quoted
Karzai as saying. On Feb. 1, Panetta told reporters that the
NATO-led coalition supporting Karzai’s government against the
Taliban will aim to end its primary combat role starting in
mid-2013 and drop back to advising Afghan forces.  The U.S. has about 89,000 troops on the ground in
 Afghanistan , after withdrawing 10,000 last year. It plans to
remove at least 23,000 more by September, and other nations are
reducing their numbers as well.  To contact the reporter on this story:
