Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  may win European
Union approval for its bid for  Synthes Inc. (SYST) , Reuters reported.  The European Commission is likely to accept concessions
offered last month by J&J to win approval of the deal before an
April 26 deadline, Reuters said, citing an anonymous source.  Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., is making
“progress in our work with antitrust authorities and look
forward to closing the transaction in the first half of this
year,” spokeswoman Lorie Gawreluk said in an e-mail.  The Brussels-based regulator declined to comment. Synthes
didn’t immediately respond to a call and an e-mail seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
