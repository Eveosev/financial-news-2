Indonesia ’s rupiah rebounded from a
two-month low after the government said it would probably delay
a plan to raise electricity prices.  The currency dropped as much as 0.4 percent earlier on
concern a proposed fuel-cost increase will spur inflation.
Policy makers will now likely wait until 2013 to lift power
tariffs to mitigate the impact of costlier fuel, Energy Minister
Jero Wacik said in Jakarta today. Gains in  consumer prices  may
accelerate to 6.8 percent from last month’s 3.56 percent if the
price of fuel is increased by 1,500 rupiah ($0.16) per liter,
Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin Nasution said on March 8.  “The delay lends positive sentiment for the market,” said
Putu Andi Wijaya, a foreign-exchange dealer at PT Bank Rakyat
Indonesia in Jakarta. “But we know the concern is still on
higher fuel prices.”  The rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 9,168 per dollar as of
4:53 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency reached 9,218 today, the
weakest level since Jan. 16. One-month implied volatility in the
rupiah, which measures exchange-rate swings used to price
options, held at 8.25 percent, the lowest level since Feb. 15.  Bank Indonesia  will continue to observe and intervene in
the foreign-exchange and bond markets to stabilize the currency,
according to a  statement  posted on its website last week.  “The central bank will likely step in between 9,190 and
9,200,” said Aris Setiawan, a foreign-exchange trader at PT
Rabobank International Indonesia in Jakarta.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
gained five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 6.02
percent, according to closing prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association. That was the highest yield since Jan. 17,
the day before Indonesia won a credit-rating upgrade from
Moody’s Investors Service which returned it to investment level.  To contact the reporters on this story:
