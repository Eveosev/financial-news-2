President  Barack Obama  discussed a
release of oil from the U.S. strategic reserve during his
meeting in Washington yesterday with U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron , a U.K. official with knowledge of the talks said.  The leaders spoke on the issue without reaching a decision,
according to the official, who asked not to be identified
because the information isn’t public.  Democrats in the U.S. Congress have urged Obama to use the
 oil stockpile  as gasoline prices have risen amid the standoff
with Iran over the Islamic republic’s nuclear program. Regular
gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, has increased 7.2
percent from a year ago, according to  AAA data . Brent crude, the
benchmark grade for U.S. imports from Europe and  Africa , has
climbed 15 percent in the past 12 months.  The two leaders discussed energy markets and  oil prices , a
White House official confirmed. The official, who wasn’t
authorize to speak publicly, wouldn’t say if talks included the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve.  The U.S. has used its reserve 18 times since 1985,
including in 2008 after hurricanes struck the Gulf Coast. It was
last tapped in July and August 2011 under an International
Energy Agency effort to ease shortages of Middle East supply.  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said
yesterday that rising oil prices are something “all economies
will be concerned about.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
