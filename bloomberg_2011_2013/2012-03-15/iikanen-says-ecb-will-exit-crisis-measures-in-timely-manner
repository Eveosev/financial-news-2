European Central Bank Governing
Council member Erkki Liikanen said the ECB will unwind crisis
measures in a “timely” manner and called on governments to use
a lull in the turmoil to fix their economies.  “Central bank measures can be used to calm the financial
markets, but a permanent solution to the debt crisis will
require both successful fiscal and structural policies and a
controlled and timely exit from the temporary central bank
measures,” Liikanen, who also heads the Bank of Finland, said
in an e-mailed statement today.  The Frankfurt-based ECB has shouldered the main burden of
fighting the three-year-old crisis by keeping banks afloat,
cutting  interest rates  to a record low and buying distressed
governments’ bonds. The unprecedented measures have swelled its
balance sheet to more than 3 trillion euros ($3.9 trillion),
prompting Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann to write a letter
to ECB President Mario Draghi warning that the central bank may
be taking on too much risk.  The ECB’s two offerings of three-year loans, which totaled
a record 1 trillion euros, have “had a decisive impact on
market developments” and “pose no risk to  price stability ,”
Liikanen said. While the ECB has raised its inflation forecasts,
risks to price stability “remain balanced,” Liikanen said.  Signaling ECB officials’ unease that governments may yet
again rely on the central bank to fight the turmoil, Liikanen
said that “slippages in the implementation of political
decisions in the current fragile economic and market situation
would be dangerous and costly.”  A Bank of Finland report, which Liikanen presented today,
said the idea that with the benchmark lending rate at 1 percent
the ECB has no further room to cut interest rates is
“misleading.”  “There is still scope for lowering the ECB’s benchmark
interest rate and non-standard measures make monetary policy
easing possible, if needed,” the report stated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
