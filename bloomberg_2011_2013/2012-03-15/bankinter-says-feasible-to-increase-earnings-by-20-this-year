Bankinter SA (BKT)  Chief Executive
Officer Maria Dolores Dancausa told shareholders it’s “more
than feasible” for the Spanish mortgage lender to boost profit
by 20 percent this year.  “We are absolutely determined and sure that the bank is
going to increase its profit compared with last year,” Dancausa
told  shareholders  at the bank’s annual general meeting in  Madrid 
today.  Bankinter said in January it had met a pledge made by
Dancausa to boost 2011  profit  by 20 percent as it posted full-
year earnings of 181 million euros ($237 million). The lender
will “keep betting” on its growing insurance unit and develop
its private banking and company lending divisions as it seeks to
boost profit this year, she said.  Bankinter, which has 59 billion euros of  assets , borrowed
9.5 billion euros at the  European Central Bank ’s auctions, said
Dancausa. The lender will remain “very alert” to acquisition
opportunities at home and abroad to increase its size even
though it considers it “sufficient,” Chairman Pedro Guerrero
told shareholders in a speech today.  Bankinter rose as much as 1.5 percent to 4.78 euros in
Madrid trading today. The bank is forecast to earn 184 million
euros this year, according to the  average estimate  in a
Bloomberg survey of 17 analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
