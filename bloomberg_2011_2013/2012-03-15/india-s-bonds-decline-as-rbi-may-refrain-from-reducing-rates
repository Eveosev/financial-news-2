India ’s bonds fell for the seventh
time in eight days on speculation faster inflation will deter
the central bank from reducing  interest rates .  Nineteen of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey predict the
 Reserve Bank  of India will hold the repurchase rate at 8.5
percent at a policy review today. The benchmark  wholesale-price 
index rose 6.95 percent from a year earlier, after climbing 6.55
percent in January, the commerce ministry said yesterday.
Government data released Feb. 29 showed India’s  economy  grew the
least in 11 quarters in the three months ended Dec. 31, fueling
speculation the central bank will lower borrowing costs.  “Inflation continues to reign higher and so the RBI may
hold rates” for now, said Upasna Bhardwaj, a Mumbai-based
economist at  ING Vysya Bank Ltd. (VYSB)   The yield on the 8.79 percent bonds due November 2021 rose
two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.30 percent as
of 10:17 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system.  The Reserve Bank boosted the  repo  rate 13 times in the last
two years to cool inflation. The rate was last increased by 25
basis points in October.  One-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 8.05 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
rate has dropped 14 basis points after the Reserve Bank cut the
 reserve requirements  for banks by 75 basis points to 4.75
percent of deposits with effect from March 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
