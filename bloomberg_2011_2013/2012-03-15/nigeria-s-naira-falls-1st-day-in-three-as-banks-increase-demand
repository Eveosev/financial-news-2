The naira weakened for the first
time in three days as banks increased their demand for dollars
after the government issued gasoline import permits for the
second quarter.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.1 percent to 157.85 per dollar on the  interbank market  as of
4:10 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria approved a tender for 3.57 million metric tons of
gasoline imports for the second quarter on March 12. Forty-two
fuel retailers including the stated-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp.,  Conoil Plc (CONOIL)  and  Oando Plc (OANDO)  were issued permits,
the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency said. The West
African country imports 70 percent of its fuel due to a lack of
refining capacity.  The naira fell as banks demanded dollars following “strong
request by petroleum marketing companies placing fuel import
orders for the second quarter,” Gregory Kronsten, head of
macroeconomic research at FBN Capital Ltd., wrote in a note to
clients today. “Another key factor influencing foreign exchange
demand is the country’s hearty consumption of imported food
products.”  Nigeria’s Senate approved spending of 4.9 trillion naira
for this year, based on an oil export price of $72 a barrel,
Senate President David Mark said at today’s session in Abuja,
the capital. Yield on the country’s $500 million of dollar bonds
due 2021 appreciated by 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point,
to 5.617. Borrowing costs of domestic bonds due 2015 increased 1
basis point to 15.85 percent, according to prices on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website.  Ghana ’s cedi depreciated to the lowest in about two months
by 0.2 percent to 1.7335 per dollar in Accra, the capital, its
weakest since Jan. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
