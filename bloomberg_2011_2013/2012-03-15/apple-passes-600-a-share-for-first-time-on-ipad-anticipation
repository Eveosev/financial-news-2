Apple Inc. (AAPL) , getting a boost from
anticipation of the new iPad, rose past $600 for the first time.  The shares gained as much as 1.8 percent to $600.01, before
retreating to $592.8 at 10:41 a.m. in New York and giving the
Cupertino, California-based company a market valuation of about
$552 billion.  Apple will start selling a new iPad tablet tomorrow and cut
the price of the previous version, helping widen its lead over
competitors. At least five analysts raised their share-price
estimates for the stock this week, citing the iPad’s dominance
over products from  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , Microsoft Corp. and  Google
Inc. (GOOG) , as well as growing sales in China and Brazil.  “The creativity and the ingenuity of the company has
driven the stock to this level,”  Philip Orlando , the New York-
based chief equity strategist at  Federated Investors Inc. (FII) , which
oversees about $370 billion including Apple shares, said today
in a phone interview. “New products and financial engineering
are going to drive the stock in the future.”  As of yesterday, Apple gave investors a 555 percent return
in the past five years and had  outperformed  the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index by 543 percent. Since 2007, investors paid an
average 43 percent  premium  for Apple’s earnings compared with
the S&P 500’s earnings. The premium yesterday was about 16
percent.  “Apple’s earnings power is potentially far greater than
investors believe and our prior bull case model suggested,”
Katy Huberty, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York who
increased her share-price estimate to $720, said in a note to
investors.  Apple in February became the sixth U.S. stock to top
$500 billion in market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
