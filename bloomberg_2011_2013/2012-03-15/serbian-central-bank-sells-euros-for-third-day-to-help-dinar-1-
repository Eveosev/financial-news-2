The Serbian central bank sold 20
million euros ($26.13 million), supporting the weakening dinar
for the third consecutive day.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it was acting
against the dinar volatility, not its trend, according to a
statement posted on its website. Earlier in the day three
currency traders said the central bank’s act was a sign it won’t
tolerate an  exchange rate  beyond 111 dinars to the euro.  The central bank began selling the common currency after
the dinar dropped to 111.2515 to the euro in morning trade. It
set the dinar rate for tomorrow at 110.9035 to the euro.  The National Bank of  Serbia  has spent 305.5 million euros
since the start of 2012 to prop up the dinar, which some
analysts see declining by 10 percent in 2012 as capital inflows
dry. It has lost 5 percent since early February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
