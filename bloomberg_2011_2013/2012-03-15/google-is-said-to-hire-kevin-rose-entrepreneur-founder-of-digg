Google Inc. (GOOG) , the world’s largest
Web-search provider, is hiring Kevin Rose, the founder of news-
aggregation service Digg Inc., according to a person with
knowledge of the matter.  The move follows Rose’s announcement yesterday that he is
shutting down the main product made by Milk, his mobile-
application company. His hiring by Google was previously
reported by the  AllThingsDigital  technology blog.  Google is stepping up its effort on social networking as it
vies for Internet advertising revenue with  Facebook Inc. (FB)  Last
year, the company unveiled the Google+ service, which has
similar functions as Facebook. With his background in consumer
Web companies, Rose may bolster Google+, said  Jeremiah Owyang ,
an analyst at  San Mateo , California-based Altimeter Group.  “It’s important to have the company focused when the
imminent threat of Facebook is at hand,” Owyang told
Bloomberg’s  Tech Deals blog . “The product is not fully baked.
That’s why they need people who can understand the
technologies.”  Rose’s Digg, founded in 2004, gained attention as a place
for people to rate news stories. Milk’s Oink product, an app
that lets people review items such as food or furniture, is
being shut down less than six months after the product was
started.  Jordan Newman, a spokesman for  Mountain View , California-
based Google, declined to comment.  Google shares rose less than 1 percent to $621.13 at the
close in  New York . The stock has fallen 3.8 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
