Grain exports from France’s Rouen
port,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, rose 4.4 percent in
the week through yesterday to the highest level in 11 months,
boosted by wheat shipments to  Africa .  Outbound grain shipments were 231,849 metric tons between
March 8 and March 14 from 222,038 tons a week earlier, the  Seine
River port  said in an e-mailed report today. Exports included
192,699 tons of soft wheat and 27,000 tons of the durum variety.  Morocco was the biggest export destination, taking 65,225
tons of soft wheat and 27,000 tons of durum, used to make
couscous and pasta, the shipping data showed. Algeria was the
second-biggest client with 45,642 tons of soft wheat.  Rouen accounted for 45 percent of  France ’s maritime grain
exports in 2009-10, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay,
which shipped out 19 percent, according to figures from national
crops office FranceAgriMer.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
