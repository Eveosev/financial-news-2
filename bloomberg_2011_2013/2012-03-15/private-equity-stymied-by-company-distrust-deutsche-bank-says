  Private equity  firms are being
stymied by companies reluctant to sell out in case they’re seen
as having done badly out of the deal, according to John Eydenberg, the global head of financial sponsors coverage at
 Deutsche Bank AG. (DBK)   “People don’t want to have sold to private equity and see
private equity make substantial returns,” Eydenberg said on
Bloomberg TV’s “Inside Track” with Erik Schatzker.  There’s a lot of cash in the hands of private equity firms
such as Washington-based Carlyle Group LP and New York-based
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) , “but unfortunately we don’t have a lot of
sellers,” he said. “That’s the problem -- that we can’t tease
out folks to sell their assets to private equity.”  Eydenberg, who’s based in  New York , said he expects a
“pretty significant expansion” in initial public offerings as
private equity firms divest themselves of companies they’ve
bought. After about $30 billion of IPOs this year, he said,
sales may reach $45 billion in 2012. Firms may also start to
hold assets for longer than the five-year average, he said.  One area of growth may be the middle market.  “If you look right now, there’s probably only a handful of
assets for sale that are attractive to the big private equity
firms,” Eydenberg said. “Smaller private equity, there’s a few
dozen companies that are for sale.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
