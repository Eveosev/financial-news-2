Australian equities headed for a
weekly advance after U.S. manufacturing rose and jobless claims
dropped, adding to signs the world’s biggest economy is
recovering. Japanese  stock   futures  fell as the yen rebounded and
a technical indicator showed signs of overheating.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Australia’s
third-largest lender, rose 0.4 percent. American depositary
receipts of  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , Japan’s second largest carmaker by
market value, slid 0.6 percent from the closing share price in
 Tokyo . ADRs of  Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  rose 1 percent after the maker of
electronic equipment and machinery boosted its net-income
forecast.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose 0.1 percent today, set
for a 1.6 percent gain this week. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
rose 0.2 percent in Wellington. Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225
Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in June closed at 10,025 in Chicago
yesterday, down from 10,060 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in
the pre-market at 10,030 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time.  “It looks like we are moving into the start of a more
favorable upward spiral,” said  Angus Gluskie , who manages more
than $350 million at White Funds Management in Sydney. “We
spend a lot of time monitoring U.S. data and the way it’s
developing positively over the past few months is very
encouraging for an overall outlook for global economic activity
and prospects of listed companies.”  Manufacturing, Jobless Claims  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent
today. The index gained 0.6 percent in  New York  yesterday,
rising above 1,400 for the first time in almost four years.
 Manufacturing (EMPRGBCI)  in the New York region expanded in March at the
fastest pace since June 2010, a report showed. Claims for
jobless benefits fell last week, matching the lowest level in
four years.  Japanese stock futures fell after the 14-day relative
strength index for the Nikkei 225 Stock Average  rose  to 78,
above the 70 threshold that some traders see as a sign the
market has been overbought and may fall.  The yen rose 0.2 percent to 83.57 per dollar yesterday,
when it touched 84.18, the lowest level since April 13. A
stronger yen decreases the value of Japanese exporters’ overseas
income when repatriated.  “A downtrend in the yen is taking a pause, and chances are
stocks will have a correction today following a rapid rally,”
said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Nomura
Holdings Inc. “Still, the market remains in a mid-term uptrend
with expectations mounting about earnings in the next fiscal
year. The Nikkei is likely to stay above 10,000.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 12.3 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with an 11.5 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 10.8 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 15.1 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the Stoxx 600.  The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index of the most-traded Chinese
companies in the U.S. rose 0.6 percent to 104.85 yesterday, led
by New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc.,  China ’s
largest private education service provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
