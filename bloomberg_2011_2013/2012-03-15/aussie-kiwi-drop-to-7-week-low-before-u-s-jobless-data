The  New Zealand dollar  rose against
its Australian counterpart as the nation’s manufacturing
industry expanded at the fastest pace since 2010.  The Australian dollar rose against the greenback as global
stocks rebounded.  New Zealand ’s dollar rose against all its
major counterparts after U.S. regional manufacturing indexes
gained to the highest in almost a year, buoying risk sentiment.  “The stronger New Zealand economic data we’re starting to
see does mean that Aussie-kiwi will continue to shift lower,”
said Mike Jones, a currency strategist at Bank of New Zealand in
Wellington. “Investors will look to play the stronger New
Zealand economic view through the Aussie-kiwi cross, rather than
against the  U.S. dollar .”  New Zealand’s currency added 0.5 percent to NZ$1.2848
versus the Aussie at 2:25 p.m. in New York. It has gained seven
of the past eight days. The kiwi rose 1.4 percent to 82.03 U.S.
cents and rallied 0.9 percent to 68.37 yen.  Australia ’s dollar advanced 0.4 percent to 87.86 yen. It
fetched $1.0541, 0.8 percent stronger.  The Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and Business New Zealand, a
Wellington-based employer group, reported today that the
Performance of Manufacturing Index  rose  to 57.7 in February from
a revised 50.8 in January. That was the highest since April
2010. A reading of more than 50 indicates that manufacturing is
expanding.  The MSCI World Index of stocks rose 0.7 percent as
manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded in March at
the fastest pace in almost a year as factory employment picked
up. New York regional manufacturing expanded at the fastest pace
since June 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
