Equatorial Guinea  added an
additional cargo of Ceiba crude to its April loading program,
according to a shipping plan obtained by Bloomberg News.  This brings total exports of Ceiba to three cargoes of 1
million barrels each, compared with two shipments originally,
the plan shows.  The last shipment of  Ghana â€™s Jubilee crude for April 29 to
30 will be deferred to early May, according to a separate
schedule. That cuts total exports of the grade for April to two
lots, including one delayed from the end of March.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
