Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA (BGLB) , the
investment firm controlled by billionaires  Albert Frere  and  Paul Desmarais , sold 6.2 million shares of  Pernod-Ricard SA (RI)  for 499
million euros ($650 million).  The shares were sold for 80.60 euros apiece, a person 
familiar with the transaction said. That’s at the low end of a 
range of 80.60 euros to 82.10 euros each shown in a term sheet 
obtained by Bloomberg News. Societe Generale SA and BNP Paribas 
SA managed the sale.  Pernod-Ricard shares fell as much as 3.8 percent and were
down 3.1 percent at 79.52 euros as of 9:57 a.m. in Brussels.
GBL, which said in a statement it made a capital gain of about
240 million euros on the sale, rose 1.2 percent to 57.90 euros.  The offering of 2.3 percent of Pernod-Ricard, a Paris-based
wine and spirits producer, is at least the second sale by GBL
this week. The Belgian holding company made a capital gain of
about 220 million euros selling its 10 percent stake in French
chemical manufacturer  Arkema SA (ARK) , according to an e-mailed
statement yesterday from GBL. The investment firm also holds
shares of French companies  Total SA (FP) ,  LaFarge SA (LG)  and  GDF Suez. (GSZ)   GBL increased its distribution of cash earnings to the
highest level in 10 years and proposed raising its dividend 2.4
percent to 2.6 euros a share, according to a March 6 statement.
That’s the smallest dividend increase since 1997, Bloomberg  data 
show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
