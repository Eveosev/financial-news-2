Trinity Mirror Plc (TNI) , the publisher
of the U.K.’s Daily Mirror tabloid newspaper, signed a 110
million-pound ($172.5 million) debt facility.  The  credit line , which reduces to 102 million pounds in
March 2014 and 94 million pounds in March 2015, matures in
August 2015 and is available from June 2013 or earlier if the
current facility is canceled, according to a statement from the
London-based company. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and
Lloyds TSB Bank Plc coordinated the deal.  The company’s current 178.5 million-pound facility, which
matures in June 2013, is undrawn and has been reduced to 135
million pounds, the company said.  In today’s preliminary results announcement, Trinity Mirror
reported a drop in revenue to 746.6 million pounds for 2011,
compared with 761.5 million pounds the year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
