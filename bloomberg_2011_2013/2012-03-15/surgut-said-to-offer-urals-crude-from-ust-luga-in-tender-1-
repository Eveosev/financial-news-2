OAO Surgutneftegas (SGTPY) , Russia’s
fourth-largest oil producer, issued a tender to sell Urals from
the Baltic Sea terminal at Ust-Luga for loading from March 21 to
March 22, said three traders who participate in the market.  The tender for 100,000 metric tons will be awarded at 3
p.m. Moscow time tomorrow, according to the people, who declined
to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak on the
matter. The company issued a similar tender last month before
canceling it later.  The terminal will have at least two loadings in March to
test facilities at the port, which was delayed from a November
opening due to engineering issues, Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for
 Russia ’s pipeline operator OAO Transneft in Moscow, said today
by telephone.  Results from the test shipments will be provided to
Russia’s industrial safety watchdog Rostekhnadzor, which needs
to approve the terminal before regular loadings can begin,
Dyomin said. Regular loadings from Ust-Luga may start in April
or May, he said.  The Ust-Luga terminal is the receiving point of Transneft’s
100 billion-ruble ($3.3 billion) Baltic Pipeline System-2. The
BPS-2 link will have a capacity of 30 million tons a year,
or 600,000 barrels a day, and is expected to pump 10 million to
15 million tons of crude this year, Dyomin said Feb. 13.  As much as 5 million tons each will be diverted from the
Baltic port of Primorsk,  Poland ’s Gdansk and the Black Sea port
of Novorossiysk, he said at the time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
