Korea Exchange Bank (004940)  will increase
profit from overseas business by tapping East Asia, the U.S. and
South American markets as the Seoul-based lender seeks growth
beyond a saturated domestic market.  The bank targets about 15 percent of earnings from abroad,
up from about 10 percent now, Chief Executive Officer Yun Yong
Ro told reporters today. The bank may pursue takeovers or use
its overseas units for the expansion, the CEO said.  Yun was appointed last month after  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) 
bought the bank from Lone Star Funds and Export Import Bank of
Korea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
