In  Illinois , long a domain for
mainstream Republican politicians,  Mitt Romney  counts on strong
support for his party’s presidential nomination.  Yet the former Republican governor of Massachusetts, who
has carried other major Midwestern industrial states in the
party’s 2012 primaries by 1- and 3-percentage-point margins,
faces another close contest with rival Rick Santorum in the
March 20 Illinois primary, a poll shows.  The Illinois race presents a pattern similar to the contest
in Ohio, where Santorum trailed Romney by 1 point faring well in
rural areas while Romney won urban and suburban regions. And,
emerging from two Southern primaries where Santorum defeated
Romney on March 13, Romney finds himself renewing his appeal to
his party’s socially conservative base, voters who alight to
Santorum’s appeal on concerns such as abortion and contraception.  “I know the term ‘establishment’ frightens people,”
Romney said in a conference call with Illinois voters yesterday
between fundraisers in the New York City area. To allay such
concerns, he pointed to his endorsements from Republican leaders
with strong conservative credentials, including Senator Tom Coburn of  Oklahoma , House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor  of
 Virginia  and former Attorney General John Ashcroft.  ‘Perhaps the Guy’s OK’  Their backing should “give a pretty good indication that,
‘Perhaps the guy’s OK,’” Romney said of himself. He brushed
aside questions about his ability to appeal to Southern
Republicans in an interview yesterday with Fox News.  “Some who are very conservative may not be yet in my camp,
but they will be when I become the nominee,” he said.  Unlike Ohio, where the larger cities are scattered, the
majority of the Illinois population and Republican vote is
centered in the Chicago metropolitan area. While the area’s
Chicago core is deeply Democratic -- home to President  Barack Obama , his re-election team, and a father and son with the last
name of Daley who ran  Chicago  for more than four decades
combined -- many of the suburbs around the city lean Republican.  A Chicago Tribune/WGN-TV poll released over the weekend
showed Romney and Santorum locked in a tight race statewide.
Romney was backed by 35 percent of likely voters and Santorum by
31 percent, within the 4-percentage-point margin of error.  Suburban-Rural Split  The survey, taken before Santorum’s latest wins in the
Mississippi and Alabama primaries, showed 16 percent of
Illinois’ likely Republican voters were undecided and 46 percent
said they might change their minds. It also revealed that Romney
is doing better in the suburbs around Chicago, while Santorum
holds the advantage outside the state’s largest metropolitan
area.  The arrival in Illinois of a Republican presidential
campaign for something other than fundraising is unusual.  The state’s primary is typically late enough not to matter
much. It last played a significant role on the Republican side
in 1988, when then-Senator  Bob Dole  of  Kansas  was dealt a
significant blow by losing Illinois to then-Vice President
George H.W. Bush. That year also marked the last general
election in which Illinois backed a Republican for president, so
the party typically doesn’t make a play for the state.  Senator John McCain of Arizona won the Illinois Republican
primary in 2008 and went on to become the party’s nominee.  High Expectations  Romney, 65, a former private equity executive, plans a
brief campaign stop in Rosemont, Illinois, tomorrow morning
before flying to Puerto Rico, which holds its primary on March
18.  Expectations are high for Romney in Illinois, considering
his campaign cash advantage and his backing by many of the
state’s top Republicans, including Senator Mark Kirk and state
Treasurer Dan Rutherford. Following the close margins by which
Romney defeated Santorum in Michigan and  Ohio , a victory in
Illinois would be significant for momentum in the race.  Illinois offers 69 of the 1,144 delegates needed to win the
party’s nomination. The state’s voters will directly elect 54 of
those delegates.  As was the case in Ohio, Santorum failed to file a full
slate of delegates, so he is only qualified for as many as 44 of
those chosen. Romney, former U.S. House Speaker  Newt Gingrich 
and Representative Ron Paul of  Texas  qualified for the full
contingent.  Gingrich Defiance  Romney and Santorum, 53, still must contend with a third
factor here: A defiant Gingrich has arrived in Illinois
following dual second-place finishes in the Southern states that
were supposed to be part of his base. Facing questions about
whether his candidacy is sustainable, he said he is “staying in
this race” as he spoke to about 75 supporters in suburban
Chicago in a room that could have easily held three times as
many people. He repeated the same language a few hours later at
a party dinner in another suburb.  Gingrich, 68, declined to answer any questions from
reporters following his first event of the day held near O’Hare
International Airport. He has won only two primaries so far,
 South Carolina  and  Georgia , a state he represented in Congress
for 20 years.  Santorum, who strengthened his status as Romney’s prime
challenger in the Republican contest by winning in Alabama and
 Mississippi , faces his next major challenge in the Illinois
primary.  Santorum’s Push  The former Pennsylvania senator wants to drive Gingrich
from the race to consolidate opposition to Romney, who leads in
the hunt for delegates to the party’s national convention in
August.  “If we keep winning races, eventually people are going to
figure out that Governor Romney is not going to be the
nominee,” Santorum told reporters yesterday in San Juan,
according to the  Associated Press .  Romney also addressed Gingrich’s campaign in his Illinois
conference call.  “You’ll find he’s an economic lightweight,” Romney said.
“Not having ever spent any time in the private sector, he
really doesn’t understand fundamentally what it takes to make
this economy grow and thrive.”  Santorum is scheduled to visit Illinois tomorrow and
campaign in the state over the weekend, after stopping in
Missouri where caucuses will also be held this weekend.  Delegate Hunt  Even amid state losses, Romney has continued to bank
delegates in a process his aides say could drag on two more
months. He has 495 delegates, including endorsements from
Republican Party leaders who automatically attend and can vote
for anyone, compared with 252 for Santorum and 131 for Gingrich,
according to AP estimates. Paul has 48.  Illinois (BEESIL)  poses economic challenges for the candidates
similar to those in Michigan and Ohio.  Illinois’  unemployment rate  of 9.4 percent is higher than
the national average of 8.3 percent, and higher than those in
Ohio and Michigan. The state also has budget and pension
shortfalls even after raising income and corporate taxes last
year, and it has the nation’s lowest general-obligation bond
rating, according to Moody’s Investors Service.  Gingrich’s future depends upon the intentions of his major
donors, said Mike George, a Texas entrepreneur who has invested
more than $200,000 in the former speaker’s presidential bid.
George was referring to  Sheldon Adelson , a Las Vegas casino
billionaire who with his family has given at least $11 million
to Winning Our Future, a political action committee backing him.  $10 Million Checks  The key for the candidate is “how long will Sheldon
continue writing these $10 million checks,” George said in an
interview yesterday on Bloomberg Television. “It’s all in his
hands.”  Adelson spokesman  Ron Reese  didn’t return calls or e-mails
seeking comment.  Rick Tyler , a senior adviser for Winning Our Future, said
Adelson’s checks are less important under a new strategy of
making it to the convention rather than winning state-by-state.  “The dynamics have changed, and all four candidates will
arrive in Tampa on equal footing,” he said in a telephone
interview yesterday. “Nobody plans to go into the convention in
third, but this is our new reality.”  Republicans and independents who lean that way are divided
over whether Gingrich and Paul should drop out so that a two-
person contest between Romney and Santorum could emerge,
according to a Bloomberg National Poll published this week.  Ad Spending  A political action committee backing Romney is already
active on Illinois television, according to data from New York-
based Kantar Media’s CMAG, which tracks advertising.  Restore Our Future, a super-PAC, has spent an estimated
$700,830 to air ads 997 times on broadcast television in the
state through March 13. Those figures don’t include advertising
run in television markets on the state’s borders.  Gingrich’s arrival in the state yesterday competed with
something that drew more attention: the last day of freedom for
the state’s former governor, Democrat  Rod Blagojevich , who is
heading to prison following his conviction of federal corruption
charges.  Obama isn’t leaving his home state unattended during the
final days of campaigning before the primary. He plans to attend
two fundraisers tomorrow in Chicago for his re-election bid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
