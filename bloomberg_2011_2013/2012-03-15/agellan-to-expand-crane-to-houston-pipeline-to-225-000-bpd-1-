Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  will
expand the capacity of its Crane,  Texas , to Houston crude-oil
pipeline to 225,000 barrels a day, according to a statement from
the company.  The expanded capacity is fully committed with long-term
agreements, according to the statement. The pipeline will move
oil production from West Texas to refineries in Houston and
 Texas City , Texas, and help “alleviate the current crude oil
oversupply situation in Cushing, Oklahoma,” Michael Mears, the
company’s chief executive officer said in the statement.  Magellan, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, announced Sept. 1 it
would proceed with the reversal of a portion of the Longhorn
oil-products pipeline that runs from Houston to El Paso, Texas,
and convert it to transport crude oil.  The reversed Crane-to-Houston portion of the pipe is
expected to begin operation at an initial capacity of 135,000
barrels a day early next year. The pipe will ramp up to the
expanded capacity of 225,000 barrels a day by mid-2013, the
company said.  The project is estimated to cost $375 million, including
the capacity expansion, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
