The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in the Asia-Pacific region
outside of  Japan  fell to the lowest in seven months, according
to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan declined 2 basis points to 144.5 as of
9:15 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. That puts it on track for its lowest close since Aug. 17,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index dropped 2 basis points to
135 as of 12:16 p.m. in Sydney, Barclays Plc prices show. The
measure is near its lowest since Aug. 5, according to CMA, which
is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index rose 1 basis point to 139.5
as of 10:37 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
