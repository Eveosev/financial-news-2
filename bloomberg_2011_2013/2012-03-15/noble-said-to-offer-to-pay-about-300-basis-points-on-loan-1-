Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL)  is offering to pay
an all-in fee just short of 300 basis points more than the
London interbank offered rate on a three-year tranche of a $1.5
billion loan, said three people familiar with the matter.  Asia â€™s biggest listed commodities trader by sales would pay
close to 200 basis points on a one-year portion of the loan, the
people said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private. The company is asking banks that want to participate at
a lead-arranger level to commit at least $75 million to the
facility, according to the people.  Noble sent out terms last week and requested responses from
banks by the end of this week, targeting to start marketing the
facility in general syndication around March 21, the people
said. Some banks have asked for an extension on the deadline in
order to have more time to process internal credit approvals,
according to the people.  The loan is expected to be split 40 percent into a one-year
maturity and 60 percent into a part that matures in three years,
another person familiar with the matter said yesterday.  The loan will refinance an $877.4 million facility, which
is part of $1.93 billion in revolving credit and term loans
originally signed in 2007 and amended two years later, one of
the people said. The funds will also help refinance $1.05
billion and 244.4 million euros of loans which are part of
revolving credit facilities signed last year, the person said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
