Hitachi Ltd. (6501) , Japan’s second-
largest manufacturer, raised its full-year profit forecast by 40
percent after proceeds from selling its hard-disk drive unit
exceeded the company’s estimate.  The company expects record  net income  of 280 billion yen
($3.3 billion) for the year ending March 31, compared with its
previous estimate of 200 billion yen, Tokyo-based Hitachi said
in a statement today. The new goal is 17 percent higher than the
238.9 billion yen profit it posted a year earlier.  The maker of nuclear reactors, train cars and air-
conditioners will post a 191 billion yen gain from the sale of
its hard-disk drive unit to  Western Digital Corp. (WDC) , 81 billion
yen more than estimated, the company said March 9.  Sales and operating profit estimates remain the same.  Hitachi  fell  0.4 percent to 489 yen on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange today, snapping a six-day winning streak. The shares
have risen 21 percent this year, compared with a 20 percent
increase in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
