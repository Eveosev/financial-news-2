Mali’s government said it will
spend more than 35.6 billion  CFA francs  ($71 million) to aid the
development of its natural resources.  The funds will be used to diversify mining research,
promote exploration for petroleum products, develop human
resources, improve governance in the mining and petroleum sector
and upgrade infrastructure for geoscientists, the government
said in a statement yesterday in Bamako, the capital.  Mali, which vies with Tanzania to be  Africa ’s third-biggest
gold producer, produces an average of 50 metric tons of the
metal annually, which accounts for 5.6 percent of the country’s
gross domestic product, according to the statement.  Over-reliance on a single resource may leave Mali’s economy
vulnerable, it said.  To contact the reporter one this story:
