Revoz d.d., the Slovenian unit of
French carmaker  Renault SA (RNO) , will stop its night shift beginning
next month as orders in Europe decline.  “Because the situation on the markets shows no signs of
improvement, we are forced to adopt additional measures to adapt
our output,” the Novo mesto, Slovenia-based company said in an
e-mailed statement. “We have seen orders decline in the past
months following a significant drop in the European markets.”  Revoz, which is Slovenia’s biggest exporter, introduced the
night shift in 2007, when it started producing the Twingo model.
The shift will stop on April 26, it said. The plant also makes
the Clio II and Wind Coupe Roadster.  To contact the reporter on this story:
