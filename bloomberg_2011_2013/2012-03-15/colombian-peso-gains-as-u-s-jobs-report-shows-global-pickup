Colombia ’s peso gained as a decline
in U.S. jobless claims added to evidence of a pickup in the
global economy, fueling demand for higher-yielding, emerging-
market assets.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 1,760.4 per  U.S. dollar , from
1,764.00 yesterday. It has jumped 10 percent this year, the
second-biggest advance after the Mexican peso among all
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “There hasn’t been bad news coming from international
markets and this helps keep risk perceptions low,” said Daniel Velandia, head analyst at Correval SA brokerage in Bogota.
“When there’s a quiet day in foreign markets, investors can
maintain their positions in the peso.”  In the U.S., the world’s biggest economy, claims for
jobless benefits dropped to 351,000 last week, matching the
lowest level in four years, Labor Department figures showed
today. Spain and  France  sold 13.04 billion euros ($17 billion)
of debt at lower borrowing costs today, the latest signs
 Europe ’s debt crisis is abating.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due July 2024 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 7.27 percent, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
