France  sold 8.46 billion euros
($11.05 billion) of notes, with borrowing costs falling in yet
another sign the  European Central Bank ’s increased lending is
spurring investor demand for the region’s debt.  The notes sold were at the top end of the 8.5 billion euros
targeted by Agence France Tresor, the country’s debt-management
body. Earlier today,  Spain  sold 3 billion euros of bonds
maturing in 2015, 2016 and 2018, the Bank of Spain said, less
than its maximum target for the auction of 3.5 billion euros.  France sold 3.26 billion euros of benchmark five-year debt
at an average yield of 1.78 percent. The borrowing cost for the
1.75 percent note maturing in February 2017 was less than the
average yield of 1.93 percent on Feb. 16. France also sold two
and four-year debt.   The ECB’s second Long Term Refinancing Operation, under
which its three-year lending reached 1.02 trillion euros in late
February, has been critical to easing bond market stress by
giving banks the means to invest in the region’s sovereign debt.  In the second such operation last month, 800 banks received a
total of 529.5 billion euros, more than the 470 billion euros
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and the 489 billion
euros of the first tender in December.  In the auction today, France sold 2.106 billion euros of
April 2014 notes at an average yield of 0.7 percent, lower than
the 1.14 percent on Sept. 15. It sold 1.93 billion euros of
October 2014 securities at a yield of 0.86 percent, below the
2.01 percent it paid on Jan. 20. France also auctioned 1.165
billion euros in February 2016 notes at an average yield of 1.4
percent compared with 2.17 percent on Nov. 17.  The country will also sell as much as 1.7 billion euros of
inflation-linked bonds later today.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
