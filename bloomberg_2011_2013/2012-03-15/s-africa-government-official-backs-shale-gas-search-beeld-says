The head of  South Africa ’s National
Planning Commission, Kuben Naidoo, backs exploration for shale
gas in the ecologically sensitive Karoo region provided
environmental safeguards are met, Beeld reported, citing Naidoo.  Gas, including shale gas, would be a cheaper option than

Naidoo told lawmakers in  Cape Town  yesterday, according to the
Johannesburg-based newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
