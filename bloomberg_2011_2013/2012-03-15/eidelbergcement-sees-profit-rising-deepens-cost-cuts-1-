HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s
third-largest maker of cement, predicted operating profit and
sales will rise this year on growth in  Asia  and Africa and a
weaker increase in raw material and energy costs.  Net income in 2011 rose 4.5 percent to 534 million euros
($695 million), the Heidelberg-based company said in a release
today. Sales advanced 10 percent to 12.9 billion euros. Both
figures beat estimates by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The
company had reported preliminary earnings on Feb. 9.  “Deleveraging remains the highest priority for us,” Chief
Executive Officer Bernd Scheifele said in the statement. “We
will again intensify our efforts to reduce costs and improve
efficiency.´´  HeidelbergCement will expand an cost-cutting target by an
additional 250 million euros by 2013, and aims to save another
150 million euros by 2014 by optimizing its supply chain. The
company proposed a dividend of 0.35 euro for each share, an
increase of 40 percent. The Bloomberg estimate was for a payout
of 40 cents.  The cement maker climbed 3.8 percent to 44 euros in
 Frankfurt  trading as of 11:25 a.m.  Lafarge SA (LG)  CEO Bruno Lafont said on Feb 17 that he
‘‘hopes’’ profit will rise this year at the world’s largest
cement maker, without being more specific or making a forecast
for sales.  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN) , the industry’s number two, on Feb. 29
forecast higher earnings for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
