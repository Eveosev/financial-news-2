Crude oil options volatility was
steady as underlying futures were little changed after touching
the lowest intraday level since Feb. 17.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 26.15 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
up from 26.11 percent yesterday.  “We broke out of the range we’ve been in,” said Ray
Carbone, president of Paramount Options Inc. in New York.  Crude for April delivery fell 32 cents to settle at $105.11
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The May contract
declined 30 cents to $105.65.  From Feb. 21 through yesterday, the front-month contract
traded in a range of $104.26 to $110.55. Futures touched $103.78
today after reports that President  Barack Obama  and U.K. Prime
Minister  David Cameron  had discussed a release from the U.S.
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stem rising pump prices.  White House Press Secretary  Jay Carney  said no such
agreement was reached though the two leaders did discuss energy
prices. Futures have risen 6.4 percent this year on concern that
 Iran ’s development of a nuclear program would result in supply
disruptions and higher prices.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were

second-most active options, declined 82 cents to 11 cents with
3,957 lots trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  Puts accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Previous Session  Bearish options accounted for 53 percent of the 125,158
