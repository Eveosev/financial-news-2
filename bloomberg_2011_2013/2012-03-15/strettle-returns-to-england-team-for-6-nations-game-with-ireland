David Strettle returns to the
 England  rugby team for this weekend’s 6 Nations finale against
Ireland at Twickenham Stadium in  London .  Strettle missed last week’s 24-22 win over France with a
chest injury and was replaced by Charlie Sharples. He’s the only
change to the starting lineup from the game in Paris, while Lee
Mears replaces injured Rob Webber on the bench.  England is a longshot to retain its 6 Nations title heading
to the final round of games in two days. England must win, have
unbeaten  Wales  lose to France and overturn a points difference
of 38. Italy hosts  Scotland  in the day’s other game.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
