Canadian natural gas rose after a
report that U.S. stockpiles fell more last week than analysts
had estimated.  Alberta  gas for April delivery gained 0.6 percent following
the  Energy Department (DOENUSCH)  report that U.S. stockpiles dropped 64
billion cubic feet to 2.369 trillion in the week ended March 9.
Inventories had been expected to fall 59 billion cubic feet, the
median of analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) .  “The withdrawal was a little larger than people thought it
would be,” said Gordy Elliott, a risk-management specialist
with INTL FC Stone LLC in St. Louis Park,  Minnesota . “Base
demand is starting to grow as gas replaces coal.”  Alberta gas for April delivery gained 1 cent to C$1.81 a
gigajoule ($1.74 per million British thermal units) as of 2:45
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 0.5 cent to settle at $2.279 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago rose
1.46 cents to $2.0616 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas gained 7.49 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.0871 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, gas advanced 8.82 cents, or 4.3 percent, to
$2.1229.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet, 371 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.76 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.3 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 925 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.73 billion cubic feet today, or 65 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.04
billion cubic feet at 1:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
