Ethanol futures gained the most in
five weeks in  Chicago  on signs distillers will exercise
production restraint to mitigate a glut.  Prices gained a day after the Energy Department said  output 
last week fell to 892,000 barrels a day, the lowest level since
Oct. 7, helping stockpiles snap a record 12-week streak of
increases.  “You get the sense that production could fall even more as
plants start spring maintenance,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst
at Linn Group in Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for April delivery climbed 3.3 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.3337 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the biggest one-day gain since Feb. 6. Prices have gained 6.1
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast rose 1.5
cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.425 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive lost 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.325, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slipped 1.5 cents, or 0.7 percent, to
$2.27 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel slid 0.5 cent to
$2.35.  The biofuel is blended with gasoline as part of U.S. energy
plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, such as crude oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
