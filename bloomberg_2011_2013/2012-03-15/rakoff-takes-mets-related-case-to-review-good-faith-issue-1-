U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who
will oversee a trial of whether the  New York  Mets owners acted
in “good faith” when they took $303 million from Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme, said he will take another case to examine
similar issues.  Maxam Capital Management LLC and founder Sandra Manzke were
sued for $100 million in principal by Madoff trustee  Irving
Picard . Rakoff, who has about 280 Mets-related cases already,
said he will remove the case from bankruptcy court to decide
Picard’s rights and obligations under non-bankruptcy law,
according to a court order filed in Manhattan yesterday.  The judge will determine whether Picard can nullify
transfers owed by a brokerage to a customer, and what standard
of proof the trustee must meet “in order to show that
defendants did not receive transfers in good faith,” he said.  The Mets owners’ trial is set to start March 19 in
 Manhattan .  The Maxam case is Picard v. Maxam Absolute Return Fund LP,
11-cv-7428, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
