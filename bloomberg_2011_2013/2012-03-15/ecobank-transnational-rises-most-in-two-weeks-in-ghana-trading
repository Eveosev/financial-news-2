Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , the
Lome-based company that operates banks in 32 African nations,
rose the most in two weeks as investors bet it will increase its
dividend payment.  The stock jumped 10 percent to 11 pesewas by the close in
Accra, the capital, today.  “Considering performance last year, Ecobank Transnational
is expected to pay higher dividend to shareholders than it did
in 2010,” Gerard Hagan-Aggrey, a stock trader at Accra-based
First Atlantic Merchant Bank, said by phone today.  Ecobank Transnational, which also trades in  Nigeria  and
 Ivory Coast , paid a dividend for 2010 of 0.4 U.S. cents a share.
Net income jumped 55 percent in the nine months through
September to 19.1 billion naira as gross earnings grew to 124.4
billion naira from 93.6 billion naira, it said on Oct. 14.  Full-year results have not yet been completed, Nabi
Souleymane Ouedraogo, a spokesman with the company, said by
phone from Lome today.  “Investors consider the price of the stock on the Ghana
market cheaper than it is on the BRVM in Abidjan or the Nigerian
market,” Hagan-Aggrey said.  In Abidjan, Ecobank Transnational was unchanged at 37  CFA
francs  ($0.07). In Lagos, the stock dropped 2.1 percent to 11
naira ($0.07). The price of 11 pesewas equals $0.06.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
