Uganda ’s coffee exports may drop 13
percent in March from a year earlier with the harvest almost
over, the Ugandan Coffee Development Authority said.  Shipments from Africa’s biggest coffee exporter may decline
to 200,000 bags from 228,579 bags a year earlier, the Kampala-
based authority said in an e-mailed statement today. A bag
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  “The harvesting season in Central and Eastern regions is
almost ending,” the agency said. “Exporters will be drawing on
their stocks to fulfill contractual obligations with their
buyers.”  Exports from October through February climbed to 1.16
million bags worth almost $172 million from 1.1 million bags
valued at $142 million a year earlier, the authority said.  Uganda was  Africa ’s biggest coffee exporter in the 12
months through September, according to the London-based
International Coffee Organization. Robusta beans, which are used
in espressos and instant drinks, account for about 85 percent of
production, according to the Ugandan authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
