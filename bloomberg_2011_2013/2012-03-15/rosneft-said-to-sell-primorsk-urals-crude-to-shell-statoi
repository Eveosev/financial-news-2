OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil
producer, sold Urals crude loading from April to September at
the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk to  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
 Statoil ASA (STL) , two traders who participate in the market said.  The volumes were not known, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the information is confidential.
Rosneft offered as much as 7.2 million metric tons in 100,000-
ton lots in a tender earlier this week.  The producer also awarded 80,000-ton cargoes of the blend
to Warly International and 140,000-ton cargoes to Vitol Group
for shipment from the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk, according
to the people.  Rosneft offered as much as 2.52 million tons of  Urals (EUCSURMD)  in
140,000-ton lots and 2.4 million tons in 80,000-ton shipments
for loading in April to September.  In a separate tender, Rosneft awarded five cargoes totaling
450,000 tons of CPC Blend crude for loading from April to June
to Glencore International Plc, the traders said.  The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which operates the only
crude export pipe in  Russia  with foreign shareholders, operates
a link that carries oil from  Kazakhstan ’s western fields to a
terminal close to Novorossiysk. The grade transported on this
link is called CPC Blend.  To contact the reporter on this story:
