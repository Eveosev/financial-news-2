Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. won the
Super-G skiing title after finishing sixth in the season-ending
race.  Vonn, 27, had led most of the race in Schladming, Austria
before almost going off course at the bottom to finish 0.57
seconds behind  Germany ’s winner Viktoria Rebensburg. American
Julia Mancuso was second today to finish runner-up to Vonn in
the discipline. Austria’s Anna Fenninger took third place in the
category.  It’s the fourth title of the season for Vonn, who has also
won the overall, downhill and super-combined standings.  Vonn needs 53 points to beat Herman Maier’s season point
record of 2,000 points set 12 years ago. She is also 23 points
off passing the women’s mark of 1,970 points set by Janica Kostelic of  Croatia  in 2006. Vonn will compete in the giant
slalom and slalom this weekend. A win in each race is worth 100
points.  Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway captured the men’s Super-G
season title despite ending in 16th place in today’s final race.
Switzerland’s Didier Cuche was second and fellow Swiss Beat Feuz
was third.  Feuz crashed on his run today, reducing his lead in the
overall standings over second-placed Marcel Hirscher of Austria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
