Diamond Trust Bank Kenya Ltd. (DTKL) , the
country’s sixth-biggest lender by market value, headed for its
largest gain in three months before a rights offer.  The stock jumped 5 percent to 94.5 shillings at 10:09 a.m.
in Nairobi, the capital. A close at that level would mark the
biggest advance since Dec. 15.  “It seems like someone is trying to enhance his position
ahead of the rights issue,” George Bodo, an equity strategist
at Nairobi-based Apex Africa Capital Ltd., said in a phone
interview today.  DTB, as the bank is known, plans to sell 24.5 million
shares on the basis of one-for-eight held, in a rights offer, it
said March 1. The capital raised will finance the bank’s plans
to explore opportunities to strengthen its presence in  East
Africa  through its subsidiary banks and to invest in other
markets in the region, Chairman Abdul Samji said.  The date and price of the offer will be determined once
regulatory and shareholder approval has been received, Samji
said.  Diamond Trust is an affiliate of the Aga Khan Fund for
Economic Development SA, a Geneva-based holding company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
