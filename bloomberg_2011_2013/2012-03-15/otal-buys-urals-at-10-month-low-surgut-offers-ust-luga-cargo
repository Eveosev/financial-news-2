Statoil ASA failed to sell  North
Sea   Forties (EUCSFORT)  crude for a second day even after it lowered the
price. Total SA bought Russian Urals blend in northwest  Europe 
at the lowest price in 10 months.  OAO Surgutneftegas,  Russia ’s fourth-largest oil producer,
issued a tender to sell Urals from the Baltic Sea terminal at
Ust-Luga for loading from March 21 to March 22, said three
traders who participate in the market. The tender for 100,000
metric tons will be awarded at 3 p.m. Moscow time tomorrow.  North Sea  Statoil was unable to sell a cargo of Forties for April 5
to April 7 loading at 45 cents a barrel more than  Dated Brent (EUCRBRDT) ,
lower than its offer yesterday of a premium of 60 cents,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts trading window.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to sell Forties for April 2 to
April 4 at 35 cents more than Dated Brent, while Exxon Mobil
Corp. didn’t manage to buy at parity to the benchmark for April
2 to April 7, the survey showed.  Reported North Sea trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was $1 a barrel more
than Dated Brent, compared with $1.25 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Statoil halted production at its Statfjord-C platform in
the North Sea after a leak of toxic gas. Statfjord-C, which has
daily output of about 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent, is the
only platform to be affected by the shutdown, the Stavanger-
based company said in an e-mailed statement today.  Brent for April settlement traded at $123.49 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $125.84 yesterday. The May contract was at
$123.03, a discount of 46 cents to April.  Mediterranean/Urals  Total bought 100,000 tons of Urals for March 31 to April 4
delivery to Rotterdam from Statoil at $2.85 a barrel less than
Dated Brent, the lowest since May 5, 2011, the survey showed.
Yesterday, Glencore International Plc sold a shipment for March
26 to March 30 at a discount of $2.75 a barrel to the benchmark.  OAO Lukoil failed to sell 80,000 tons of the blend for
March 25 to March 29 delivery to Augusta,  Italy , at $2.40 a
barrel less than Dated Brent, according to the survey.  Urals (EUCSURNW)  was at $2.71 a barrel less than the benchmark in
northwest Europe, the lowest since May 12, compared with a
discount of $1.90 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Russia will ship 10 cargoes of 100,000 tons each of Urals
crude from the Baltic port of Primorsk from March 31 to April 5,
one more than a month earlier, according to a partial loading
schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  Russia will also export two lots of 140,000 tons and two
80,000-ton shipments from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  from
April 1 to April 4, the plan shows.  OAO Rosneft sold Urals crude loading from April to
September at Primorsk to Shell and Statoil, two traders who
participate in the market said.  The producer also awarded 80,000-ton cargoes of the blend
to Warly International and 140,000-ton cargoes to Vitol Group
for shipment from Novorossiysk, according to the people.  In a separate tender, Rosneft awarded five cargoes totaling
450,000 tons of CPC Blend crude for loading from April to June
to Glencore, the traders said.  West Africa  Mercuria Energy Trading SA and Itochu Corp. sold crude to
 Bharat Petroleum  Corp. for loading in April, according to three
traders who declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak with the media.  The Indian company bought about 1 million barrels of Libyan
Sarir crude from Itochu and about 950,000 barrels of  Nigeria ’s
Antan oil from Mercuria, the traders said.  Bharat Petroleum issued a tender seeking to buy crude for
loading from May 1 to May 15, according to a document obtained
by Bloomberg News. The tender closes on March 20, with offers
valid until the following day, the document shows.  Equatorial Guinea  added an additional cargo of Ceiba crude
to its April loading program, according to a shipping plan
obtained by Bloomberg News. This brings total exports of Ceiba
to three cargoes of 1 million barrels each, compared with two
shipments originally, the plan shows.  The last shipment of  Ghana ’s Jubilee crude for April 29 to
30 will be deferred to early May, according to a separate
schedule. That cuts total exports of the grade for April to two
lots, including one delayed from the end of March.  Qua Iboe (AFCSQUA1)  crude was at $2.67 a barrel more than Dated Brent,
compared with $2.63 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
