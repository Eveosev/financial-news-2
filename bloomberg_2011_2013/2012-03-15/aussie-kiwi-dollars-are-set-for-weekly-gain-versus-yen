The  New Zealand dollar  rose against
the U.S. currency and Australia’s was stronger as this week’s
rally in global equities spurred demand for higher-yielding
assets.  The Aussie and kiwi gained against the yen this week as the
 Bank of Japan (8301)  said in minutes of its February meeting that its
decision to expand asset purchases was “appropriate.”  “The Aussie and kiwi dollars have been able to reclaim
some ground as part of the confidence play with U.S. equities
hitting some milestones,” said  Tim Waterer , a currency dealer
at CMC Markets in Sydney. “There’s more upside for the Aussie
against both the yen and greenback.”  New Zealand’s currency rose 0.7 percent to 82.49 U.S. cents
at 12:20 p.m. in  New York , advancing its weekly rise to 0.4
percent. It fetched 68.75 yen from 67.74 a week ago.  Australia’s dollar bought $1.0586 and gained 0.1 percent
since last week. It rose 0.3 percent to 88.21 yen, and advanced
1.2 percent this week.  Stocks Rally  The  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  of equities has gained 2.2 percent
since March 9, the most since the five-day period ended Jan. 20.
The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index yesterday closed at its highest
level since June 2008.  Japanese central bank Governor Masaaki Shirakawa’s board
last month unexpectedly added 10 trillion yen ($120 billion) to
an asset-purchase program and set a 1 percent inflation goal
after an economic slide fueled criticism it has been slower to
act than counterparts.  One board member indicated that aiming for inflation of 2
percent in the long term would avoid one-sided yen moves, the
minutes released today showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
