India ’s government should pay a
fixed amount per liter as diesel subsidy to cut spending and
shield it from rising crude prices, the finance ministry said.  Shifting the burden of higher  oil prices  to consumers would
curb consumption of diesel and limit the government’s subsidy
bill, the ministry said in its annual economic survey presented
in parliament today.  “What is important is that the subsidy should be pre-
specified so that, thereafter, government stays fully out of the
picture,” according to the survey.  The government controls prices of some fuels and gives
refiners cash as partial compensation for sales below cost. The
oil ministry has sought 420 billion rupees ($8.4 billion) as
subsidy from the finance ministry for losses from sales of
diesel, kerosene and cooking gas in the six months ending March
31, Oil Secretary G.C. Chaturvedi said Dec. 21.  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL) , the nation’s biggest refiner,  Bharat
Petroleum Corp. (BPCL)  and  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. (HPCL)  lost a combined
567.3 billion rupees on diesel sales in the nine months ended
Dec. 31, according to oil ministry’s  website .  Brent crude in London trading, a benchmark for India, has
increased 16 percent this year. The April contract, which
expires today, was down 9 cents at $124.88 on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange at 2:32 p.m. Singapore time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
