Germany ’s opposition Social
Democrats urged Chancellor  Angela Merkel  not to delay passage of
new euro-area budget rules through parliament, signaling the
party’s readiness to back the legislation,  Der Spiegel  reported,
citing the party’s federal caucus chief Frank-Walter Steinmeier.  Merkel may be awaiting the outcome of French presidential
elections before initiating legislation for the so-called Fiscal
Compact through parliament, Steinmeier is cited as saying.
Merkel needs a two-thirds majority in the lower house to approve
the legislation, the German magazine said.  While the SPD has suggested its backing may be tied to the
implementation of a European Union-wide financial transaction
tax, fostering  Europe ’s unity has priority, Steinmeier told
Spiegel.  “Letting Europe go to the dogs is not in the interest of
the politics we pursue for people,” he is cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
