Syracuse University  overcame a
four-point halftime deficit to avoid becoming the first No. 1
seed since 1985 to lose to a 16th-seeded team in the menâ€™s
college basketball national tournament.  The Orange (32-2) used a late 8-0 run to win 72-65 against
the University of North Carolina-Asheville (24-10).  Syrcause, playing its first game since center Fab Melo was
ruled ineligible, fell behind by seven points in the first half
and trailed 34-30 at halftime.  It was the first time a No. 1 seed had trailed at the half
in the opening round since  Kansas  was behind against  Holy Cross 
in 2002, ESPN said. Kansas went on to win 70-59.  Since 1985, top-seeded teams have a 104-0 record in the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament against
16th-seeded teams.  James Southerland had 15 points to lead the Orange, which
was tied 54-54 with 6:42 remaining before going on a decisive 8-
0 run that included five points from Southerland.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
