Alaska Air Group Inc. hedged 50
percent of its jet fuel needs for this year, according to a
company filing.  The parent company of Alaska Airlines has cover at the
equivalent of $100 a barrel of crude for this year, according to
a March 13  filing  with the Securities and Exchange Commission
posted on its website.  Hedging allows airlines to agree on prices for future fuel
needs and is intended to help guard against cost fluctuations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
