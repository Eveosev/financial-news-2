New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s headquarters in
Manhattan in a show of support after a departing employee
publicly criticized the firm’s culture yesterday.  “The mayor stopped by to make clear that the company is a
vital part of the city’s economy, and the kind of unfair attacks
that we’re seeing can eventually hurt all New Yorkers,” said
 Stu Loeser , a spokesman for the mayor.  Bloomberg visited the firm today about 11 a.m. and met with
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and numerous
employees, Loeser said.  Greg Smith, an executive director who sold U.S. equity
derivatives to clients in Europe, the  Middle East  and Africa,
wrote in a New York Times opinion piece that he is leaving the
firm after 12 years. Smith assailed the company’s treatment of
clients and blamed Blankfein and President Gary D. Cohn for
losing hold over the bank’s culture.  They responded in a memo to current and former employees,
saying that Smith’s assertions don’t reflect the company’s
values, culture or “how the vast majority of people at Goldman
Sachs think about the firm and the work it does on behalf of our
clients.” David Wells, a bank spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment after business hours.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
