Andy Warhol ’s 1963 canvas of two
Elvis Presleys brandishing guns against a silver background is
heading to the auction block at Sotheby’s in May with an
estimate range of $30 million to $50 million.  Titled “Double Elvis [Ferus Type],” it was one of 22
Elvis silkscreen paintings first exhibited at the Ferus Gallery
in  Los Angeles  in late 1963. Nine of them are in museum
collections, including the Museum of  Modern Art  in  New York .  “It’s a very desirable image,” said Alberto Mugrabi,
whose family has one of the largest private Warhol collections,
but not this work. “I’d love to have it.”  In the Sotheby’s version, the second Elvis is faint,
looking almost like a shadow. In  MoMA’s canvas  both figures are
clearly visible.  The work, depicting Elvis dressed as a cowboy and shooting
from the hip, has no guarantee.  Sotheby’s (BID)  will show it in Los
Angeles, London and Hong Kong before offering it during its
contemporary-art evening sale on May 9 in New York.  A painting from the series last appeared at auction in 1995
when it fetched $497,500 at  Christie’s (CTTDY)  in New York, according to
Artnet, an online art-market data provider. In 2004, Christie’s
sold a similar painting, “Single Elvis [Ferus Type],” for $3.4
million.  (Katya Kazakina is a reporter for Muse, the arts and
