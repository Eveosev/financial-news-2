Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
companies have never paid more dividends following increases
this week by banks including  JPMorgan (JPM)  Chase & Co., according to
 Howard Silverblatt , S&P’s senior index analyst.  Announced payouts imply an annual dividend rate of $29.02
per index share, Silverblatt said in a note today. The prior
record was $28.96 in June 2008 before the figure slid 26 percent
to $21.44 in August 2009. It has since risen 35 percent. S&P 500
companies are paying out 30 percent of  profits , less than the
average of 52 percent, S&P data show.  “Companies have the money, they have the ability, and
dividends are back in fashion,” he said in a telephone
interview today. “We would expect to see more banks.”  JPMorgan boosted its quarterly dividend by 20 percent to 30
cents a share this week, after the  Federal Reserve  completed
stress tests of the 19 largest U.S. banks to gauge their ability
to withstand a severe economic downturn.  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  and
U.S. Bancorp also boosted their payouts and authorized share
repurchases.  Financial stocks in 2007 accounted for 30 percent of S&P
500 dividends, he said. The amount has fallen to 13 percent,
which is the second-highest among 10 industries, according to
S&P data. The consumer-staples group contributes 15 percent.  Dividend Aristocrats  Companies with the best track records of paying dividends
are lagging behind the rest of the stock market this year after
concern about the European debt crisis gave them better returns
in 2011. The  S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index (SPDAUDT)  of companies
that raised payouts for at least 25 straight years returned 7.1
percent in 2012 through yesterday, trailing the 11 percent gain
for the entire  S&P 500 . In 2011, the returns were 8.3 percent
and 2.1 percent, respectively.  Improved U.S. economic data coupled with speculation
European leaders will contain the region’s debt crisis have
pushed investors to riskier companies. Financial and technology
stocks, which have the two lowest dividend yields in the S&P 500
among 10 industries, have risen the most in 2012.  Last year ,
utilities and consumer-staples companies led. They have the
second- and third-highest dividend rates.  Combined profits  by S&P 500 stocks rose 9.9 percent to a
record $92.23 a share in 2011, Bloomberg data show. Companies
are seeking ways to give back money to shareholders after piling
up more than $1 trillion of cash in the fourth quarter of last
year, according to S&P data.  The current S&P 500 dividend yield is 1.96 percent. That
compares with the average of about 3.24 percent between 1970 and
1994, before the Internet bubble helped drive down yields to a
low of 1.05 percent in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
