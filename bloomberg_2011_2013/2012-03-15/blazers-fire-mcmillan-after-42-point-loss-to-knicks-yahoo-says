The  Portland Trail Blazers  fired
coach Nate McMillan a day after a 42-point loss to the  New York
Knicks .  Assistant Kaleb Canales will take over on an interim basis,
team President Larry Miller said today in an e-mailed release.  “The season to this point hasn’t gone the way we had hoped
it would, and after talking with Nate we decided it was best to
part ways,” Miller said in the release.  Portland is 20-23, last in the National Basketball
Association’s Northwest Division, 12 1/2 games behind the
Oklahoma City Thunder. The loss to the Knicks was the Trail
Blazers’ worst defeat of the season and their fourth double-
digit defeat in five games.  McMillan, 47, has a 266-269 mark in seven seasons with
 Portland , including playoff appearances in each of the past
three years. The Trail Blazers’ second-longest tenured coach, he
has an NBA coaching record of 478-452 in 12 seasons, including
five with the Seattle SuperSonics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
