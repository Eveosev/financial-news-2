Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  extending an eight-month high, as the
yen’s drop to an 11-month low against the dollar buoyed earnings
prospects for exporters.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets 44 percent of its
revenue in  North America , rose 3.5 percent amid optimism for the
U.S. economic recovery.  Nippon Chutetsukan KK (5612)  rose 7.5 percent
after the iron-pipe maker raised its net-income forecast.  Sharp
Corp. (6753)  slid 5.3 percent after the electronics maker forecasting a
record loss named a new president.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.7 percent to 10,123.28
at 3 p.m. in Tokyo, the highest close since July 22. The broader
Topix Index gained 0.8 percent to 863.61. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index excluding  Japan  lost 0.2 percent.  “Perhaps we are seeing a sustained devaluation of the yen,
which would improve the outlook for Japanese exporters in
particular,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps manage $1 billion
in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in  Melbourne . “Perhaps what
we are seeing is a redirection of  asset allocation  toward Japan
because a lot of fund managers are underweight, and that’s
pushed up the market very quickly ahead of fundamentals.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent
today. The gauge lost 0.1 percent in  New York  yesterday,
snapping a five-day advance that drove it to the highest level
since June 2008.  Weaker Yen  Stocks gained as the yen reached 84.18 against the dollar
today, its lowest since April 13. The currency has weakened on
the Bank of Japan’s expansion of its asset-purchase program and
signs of U.S. recovery. BOJ Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  signaled
on March 13 that additional bond purchases aren’t off the table.
U.S. reports this week are expected to show that initial jobless
claims fell and industrial production climbed.  “The BOJ was a trigger, but the yen has been weakening
because the  U.S. economy  is stronger than expected,” said
Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment officer of RCM Japan Co. “A
drop in the yen may well improve earnings, and the market is
simply pricing that in.”  Honda advanced 3.5 percent to 3,295 yen.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a
camera maker that generates more than 80 percent of its sales
abroad, rose 3.7 percent to 3,945 yen.  Overbought Indicators  Gains in stocks were limited as the 14-day relative
strength index for the Nikkei 225 rose to 78 today, above the 70
threshold that some traders say signals shares have been
overbought.  The Nikkei 225 has risen about 20 percent this year, the
second best performer after German stocks among 24 developed
markets this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Shares in the Japanese benchmark are valued at 24.2 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.4 times for the
S&P 500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 2.4 percent to 22.75,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.5 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume on the
index was 39 percent above its 100-day average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The following were among the most active shares in the
