U.S. stocks advanced, after the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index topped 1,400 for the first time in
almost four years, as data showed manufacturing in the New York
region unexpectedly increased and jobless claims declined.  Financial (S5FINL)  and industrial companies rose the most among 10
groups in the  S&P 500  as  Bank of America Corp.  and General
Electric Co. added at least 1.3 percent. The Dow Jones
Transportation Average, a proxy for economic growth, gained 3.4
percent as  CSX Corp. (CSX)  surged 7.4 percent. International Business
Machines Corp. rallied a seventh straight day to a  record .  The S&P 500 added 0.4 percent to 1,399.96 at 2:13 p.m. New
York time, after briefly topping the median 2012 strategist
estimate of 1,400. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  advanced
25.89 points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,219.99, gaining for a
seventh day, the longest winning streak in 13 months. About 4.8
billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges.  “It’s been a smooth ride this year,”  Russ Koesterich , the
San Francisco-based global chief investment strategist for the
IShares unit of BlackRock Inc., said in a phone interview. His
firm oversees $3.51 trillion as the world’s largest asset
manager. “The economy is doing better than people thought. The
corporate sector has remained very profitable. Valuations are
reasonable. The buying is justified.”  The S&P 500 is on pace for the best first quarter since
 1998 (SPX) , after rallying 11 percent, amid better-than-estimated
economic and corporate reports. The index trades at  14.5 times 
reported earnings, the highest valuation level since July and
below the average since 1954 of 16.4 times earnings.  Economic Data  Equities rose as  manufacturing  in the New York region
expanded in March at the fastest pace since June 2010. Claims
for jobless benefits fell last week, matching the lowest level
in four years, more evidence the labor market is improving.
Separate data showed that the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s general economic index increased to 12.5 in March
from 10.2 last month, beating economists’ estimates.  “The U.S. economic numbers are quite encouraging,”
 Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment
officer at Philadelphia Trust Co., said in a telephone
interview. “Stocks have reached new highs, but valuations are
reasonable. People who haven’t gotten into the market might be
drawn in because the economy is improving and there are some
relative good values out there.”  Companies most-tied to economic growth led the gains in the
S&P 500. The  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Cyclical Index of companies advanced
1.4 percent. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX)  rallied 2.6 percent as all of
its 24 stocks advanced.  Banks, GE  Bank of America  gained 3.7 percent to $9.17.  JPMorgan Chase
& Co. (JPM)  increased 2.5 percent to $44.67. GE added 1.3 percent to
$20.04.  A measure of  transportation  shares in the S&P 500 had the
biggest gain among 24 industries, adding 3.2 percent. The
Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index jumped 3.9 percent.  FedEx Corp. (FDX) 
increased 2.7 percent to $94.70. CSX climbed 7.4 percent, the
most in the S&P 500, to $21.71.  Technology shares, which comprise more than 20 percent of
the S&P 500, swung between gains and losses.  IBM (IBM)  advanced to a
new record, adding 0.4 percent to $205.47.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  fell 1.6
percent to $580.16, after climbing above $600 for the first time
earlier today.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD)  gained 5.7 percent to $8.20.
