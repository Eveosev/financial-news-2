China’s stocks  fell, driving the
benchmark level to the lowest level in almost a month, as a drop
in foreign investment boosted concerns a slowdown in the world’s
second-biggest economy will worsen.  China Vanke Co. (200002)  and Poly Real Estate Group Co. led a gauge
of property stocks to its biggest two-day decline since November
2010 after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said yesterday home prices are
still far from reasonable levels.  Chongqing Brewery Co. (600132)  and
Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. paced a decline for companies
based in the municipality after Bo Xilai was replaced as the
city’s communist party chief.  Zijin Mining Group Co. (601899) , China’s
largest gold producer, dropped 2.3 percent as bullion prices
tumbled to an eight-week low.  “The economy is still on a downward trend and first-
quarter corporate earnings won’t be very good,” said Wang Weijun, a strategist at Zheshang Securities Co. in Shanghai. “A
further big slump may not be possible because valuations for
large companies are pretty low.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  slid 17.46 points, or 0.7
percent, to 2,373.77 at the close, the lowest since Feb. 20.
About three stocks fell for every one that gained. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  declined 0.8 percent to 2,585.55. The  Bloomberg China-US
55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, retreated 2.3 percent in  New York  yesterday.  The Shanghai Composite’s loss has pared this year’s gains
to 7.9 percent in 2012. Stocks in the index trade at 9.8 times
estimated profit, compared with a record low of 8.9 times on
Jan. 6,  weekly data  compiled by Bloomberg showed. About 24.7
billion shares changed hands in the Shanghai index yesterday,
the highest since November 2010. Thirty-day  volatility  on the
gauge was at 16.36, close to its highest in almost two weeks.  Investment Slows  Foreign direct investment in  China  fell for a fourth
straight month in February as companies reined in spending amid
a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy and the
prolonged European debt crisis.  Investment declined 0.9 percent to $7.73 billion last month
from a year earlier, the Ministry of Commerce said in a
statement today, following a 0.3 percent drop in January.  Data last week showed China’s factory output in the first
two months of the year rose the least since 2009, while retail
sales increased less than economists predicted and inflation
eased to the slowest pace in 20 months. Premier Wen announced at
the beginning of a national lawmakers’ congress on March 5 an
economic growth target of 7.5 percent for this year, down from 8
percent over the past seven years.  “If you look at the Chinese data, you should stop debating
about a hard landing,” said  Adrian Mowat , JPMorgan Chase &
Co.’s chief Asian and emerging-market strategist. “China is in
a hard landing. Car sales are down, cement production is down,
steel production is down, construction stocks are down. It’s not
a debate anymore, it’s a fact.”  Property Concerns  A measure tracking property stocks lost 2.5 percent,
extending yesterday’s 3.7 percent decline. The two-day slide is
the biggest since Nov. 12, 2010.  Vanke, the nation’s biggest listed property developer, fell
1 percent to 8.21 yuan. Poly Real Estate, the second largest,
retreated 2.6 percent to 10.72 yuan.  Gemdale Corp. (600383) , the fourth
biggest, slid 4.4 percent to 5.62 yuan. Hangzhou Binjiang Real
Estate Group Co. lost 4.8 percent to 7.99 yuan.  “One should be concerned about what’s happening in the
China property market,” Mowat said at yesterday’s conference.
“People are too complacent that the government can turn what’s
going on in this market.”  Bo’s Removal  Chongqing Brewery tumbled 8.2 percent to 33.56 yuan, its
biggest decline since Jan. 16. Chongqing Changan, the Chinese
partner of Ford Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp., fell 3 percent
to 4.54 yuan.  Chongqing Fuling Electric Power Industrial Co. (600452) 
dropped 2.7 percent to 9 yuan.  Zhang Dejiang, a North Korean-educated member of China’s
ruling Politburo, will replace Bo as the head of Chongqing, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported. The replacement comes
after Bo’s former police chief, Wang Lijun, went to the U.S.
consulate last month in  Chengdu , prompting speculation that he
was seeking asylum.  “It’s all about the sentiment not about fundamentals,”
said  Wang Zheng , Shanghai-based chief investment officer at
Jingxi Investment Management Co., which manages about $120
million. “It’s a knee-jerk reaction from the market, which
interprets the removal of the party chief as negative news for
all locally listed companies.”  Repo Rate  Zijin Mining dropped 2.3 percent to 4.32 yuan. Shandong
Gold Mining Co., the second largest, fell 2.4 percent to 33.57
yuan.  Zhongjin Gold Co. (600489) , the third biggest, retreated 2.7
percent to 21.45 yuan.  Gold futures for April delivery retreated 3 percent to
settle at $1,642.90 an ounce in New York yesterday on
speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will refrain from offering
additional stimulus.  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , the nation’s biggest oil
refiner, rose 0.7 percent to 7.56 yuan. PetroChina Co., the
second largest, added 0.5 percent to 10.23 yuan. The nation may
raise gasoline and diesel prices today or tomorrow by about 500
yuan a ton, C1 Energy says on its website yesterday.  In a sign that the government may be taking more steps to
support growth, China is easing restrictions on lending capacity
at three of the nation’s four biggest banks, officials at the
lenders with knowledge of the matter said.  The money-market rate dropped today after the central bank
lowered the rate on its 91-day repurchase contract for the first
time in three years.  The central bank sold 20 billion yuan ($3.2 billion) of the
contracts at a yield of 3.14 percent, down from 3.16 percent a
week ago. The seven-day repurchase rate, which measures
interbank funding availability, fell 12 basis points to 2.88
percent as of 3:25 p.m., according to a weighted average
compiled by the National Interbank Funding Center.  “It’s an easing signal,” said Guo Caomin, a bond analyst
at Industrial Bank Co. in  Shanghai . “The central bank has more
room to bring down money-market rates as inflation trends
down.”  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from  Judy Chen  in Shanghai.
