“Katie,” former CBS News anchor
 Katie Couric ’s upcoming talk show, reached agreements making the
program available in 94 percent of the U.S., according to  Walt
Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC broadcast network.  The show will start Sept. 10, “Katie” executive producer
Jeff Zucker said today in an e-mailed statement from ABC, which
is distributing the show.  Couric is starting a talk show after Oprah Winfrey ceased
production of her broadcast program to focus attention on the
OWN cable channel she owns with  Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) 
Zucker, the former chief executive officer of NBC Universal,
said today that Joe Terry, the director of Winfrey’s TV show,
will direct “Katie.”  Kathy Samuels, who helped start “Rachel Ray” and “Access
Hollywood” programs, has been brought on as co-executive
producer, Zucker said.  “Katie” will be broadcast live weekdays in front of an
audience from ABC’s TV One studio in New York.  Disney, based in Burbank, California, was little changed at
$43.47 at the close in New York today. The  shares  have climbed
16 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
