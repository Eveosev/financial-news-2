The  Los Angeles Lakers  traded away
five-time National Basketball Association champion  Derek Fisher 
and two first-round draft picks in the hours leading up to
today’s trading deadline.  The Lakers used the deals to acquire a trio of players as
the team looks to return to the NBA Finals for the eighth time
in the last 13 seasons.  The Lakers said they sent a first-round draft pick and
Fisher, a guard who is the president of the NBA Players
Association and won five NBA titles with the Lakers, to the
 Houston Rockets  in return for Jordan Hill.  “I want to express my deepest gratitude to Derek for
everything he has meant to this organization over the years,”
Lakers owner Jerry Buss said in a statement on the team’s
website. “Few who have worn the Lakers uniform have done so
with as much class as Derek, both on the court and in the
community.”  Los Angeles  also dealt forward Luke Walton, guard Jason Kapono and its 2012 first-round pick to Cleveland for guard
Ramon Sessions and forward Christian Eyenga, the Cavaliers said
in an e-mailed release.  Amid the flurry of trades before the 3 p.m. New York
deadline, perhaps the biggest news focused on a player who
stayed put.  Orlando Magic center  Dwight Howard , the three-time NBA
Defensive Player of the Year, announced this afternoon he would
waive a clause in his contract that would have allowed him to
become a free agent after this season. That kept him off the
trading block and under contract with Orlando through the
2012-13 season.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster  To contact the reporter on this story:
