AMC Networks Inc. (AMCX) , spun out of
 Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)  in June, fell the most since September
after reporting fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’
estimates.  The owner of AMC, Sundance and IFC cable channels declined
4.4 percent to $44 at the close in  New York  for the biggest one-
day drop since Sept. 2.  Net income rose 53 percent to $29.5 million, or 41 cents a
share, from $19.3 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier, New
York-based AMC said today in a  statement . Excluding interest
expenses and restructuring charges, profit of 40 cents a share
missed the 60-cent average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Marketing the return of “Mad Men” and “The Killing”
weighed on AMC’s profit. The company is spending between $10
million and $15 million on campaigns ahead of the shows’ new
seasons later this month. “The Walking Dead,” the most-watched
scripted show on cable among younger viewers sought by
advertisers, ends its second season March 18.  “We think the quality of AMC’s programming will amplify
top-line growth as well as content expenses in 2012 as ‘Mad Men’
returns and as new shows are premiered,”Rich Tullo, an analyst
with Albert Fried & Co. in New York, wrote in a March 12 note.  Revenue was $339 million compared to $298.5 million a year
earlier. That compared to an average estimate of $330.9 million
in a Bloomberg survey.  (AMC executives will discuss financial results on a
