Regions Financial Corp. (RF) , Alabama’s
largest lender, had its investment-grade  credit rating  restored
by  Standard & Poor’s  as the bank prepares to repay a $3.5
billion bailout by U.S. taxpayers.  Regions, which passed the Federal Reserve’s stress tests
this week and raised $900 million in a share sale, was raised to
BBB- from BB+, S&P said today in a statement. The company said
it plans to use proceeds from the offering to help repay its
2008 rescue by the U.S. Treasury Department.  The lender, which hasn’t reported an annual profit since
2007 in the wake of the U.S. housing crisis, is spending less on
soured loans and agreed to sell its Morgan Keegan brokerage
earlier this year to get $1.18 billion.  “The upgrade primarily reflects our view that Regions’s
capital and earnings have improved,” S&P said. “We expect that
Regions will remain firmly profitable over the next two years.”  Shares of the Birmingham-based company rose 4.4 percent to
$6.44 at 3:17 p.m. in  New York , advancing for a second day after
the Fed informed Regions it wouldn’t object to the firm’s
capital plan. The bank has advanced 50 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
