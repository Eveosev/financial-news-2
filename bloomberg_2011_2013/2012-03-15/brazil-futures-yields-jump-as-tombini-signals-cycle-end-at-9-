Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts surged the most in almost three years after 
the central bank signaled it will refrain from lowering borrowing 
costs below 9 percent, prompting traders to reverse wagers on 
more aggressive cuts.  The yield on the contract due in January 2013 jumped 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 8.92 percent at 9:16
a.m. in  Sao Paulo . It was the biggest increase since June 2009.  Brazil ’s central bank said it sees  interest rates  declining
to levels just above the record low of 8.75 percent as inflation
in  Latin America ’s biggest economy remains under control. Policy
makers, in the minutes of their March 6-7 meeting, said they saw
a “high probability” of the benchmark Selic rate falling to
“levels slightly above the historical lows and stabilizing at
those levels.”  “Since the Selic went to 8.75 percent in 2009, apparently
the central bank wants to say that now it’s going to stop at 9
percent,” Ures Folchini, head of fixed-income at Banco West LB
do Brasil SA, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “The central bank
moved up the 75 basis-point cut to arrive at the end of the
cycle more quickly.”  The real advanced 0.4 percent to 1.7964 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1.8044 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
