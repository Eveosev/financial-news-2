Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest airline, will boost the equity of its Austrian
Airlines unit by 140 million euros ($183 million) and approve
the lease of Airbus SAS jets to ensure the business’s survival.  Lufthansa’s supervisory board endorsed the payment to
alleviate Austrian Air’s “critical” situation, on the condition
that agreed restructuring plans be fully implemented, the
Cologne, Germany-based company said today.  “In return, we expect an indispensable contribution from
works councils and trade unions,” Chief Executive Officer
Christoph Franz said in  Frankfurt . “Market-oriented, competitive
employment conditions” must be enforced for air crew, he added.  The lease of seven Airbus A320 single-aisle aircraft by
Austrian was also approved by the board, with 11  Boeing Co. (BA)  737s
to be sold, he said.  Franz said that Lufthansa will press on with the sale of
its unprofitable U.K. unit BMI to International Consolidated
Airlines Group SA. The British Airways parent has offered
concessions to European Union regulators reviewing the bid, and
the deadline for a ruling has been extended to March 30.  “Despite extensive restructuring measures, the turnaround
could not be achieved and there was and is unfortunately no
alternative to the sale,” the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
