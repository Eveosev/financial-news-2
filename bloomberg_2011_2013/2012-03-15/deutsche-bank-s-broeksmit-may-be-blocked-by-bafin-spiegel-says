Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) ’s designated co-
Chief Executive Officer  Anshu Jain  may fail in his bid to make
William Broeksmit chief risk officer because of concerns at
German financial regulator Bafin,  Spiegel  reported, citing
unidentified people in the finance industry.  Bafin hasn’t yet signed off on the candidacy of Broeksmit,
who was due to be voted tomorrow by the bank’s supervisory board
to succeed Hugo Banziger, the magazine said. The regulator
usually checks candidates for “professional qualification” and
“reliability,” Spiegel said.  Deutsche Bank is now hurrying to find a replacement
candidate in time for the supervisory board session, Spiegel
reported. Deutsche Bank and Bafin declined to comment, the
magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
