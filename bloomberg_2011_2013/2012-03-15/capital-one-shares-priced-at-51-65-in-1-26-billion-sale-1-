Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that bought ING Groep NV’s online U.S. bank, sold $1.26
billion of shares for 1.3 percent below yesterday’s closing
price as it prepares to purchase HSBC Plc’s U.S. card business.  The credit-card issuer sold 24.4 million shares for $51.65
each, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The McLean,
Virginia-based firm’s stock closed at $52.33 yesterday in New
York. It fell 0.5 percent from that price at 9:33 a.m. today.  The sale will help the lender complete its second major
acquisition of the past year as Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, 61, works to transform the bank into one of the
largest in the U.S. Capital One completed a $9 billion purchase
of ING Direct last month to gain about 7 million customers and
$80 billion in deposits.  The transaction with HSBC,  Europe ’s largest bank, is a
“very financially attractive acquisition, as we thought from
day one,” Chief Financial Officer Gary Perlin said at a
presentation in New York on Feb. 16.  The bank agreed in August to purchase HSBC’s U.S. credit-
card business for a premium of about $2.6 billion. Capital One
has said it expects the acquisition, which comes with about $30
billion of assets, to be completed in the second quarter. The
deal will generate a post-tax gain of $2.4 billion for HSBC, the
London-based lender said in August, when the deal was announced.  Capital One picked  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  and Credit Suisse Group AG to conduct the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
