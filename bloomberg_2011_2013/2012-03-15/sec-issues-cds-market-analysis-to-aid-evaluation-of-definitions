The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission released a staff analysis of data on credit-default
swap transactions, designed to help evaluate final Dodd-Frank
Act rules for the $708 trillion global swaps market.  The analysis by the agency’s Division of Risk, Strategy and
Financial Innovation was made available today as part of the
comment file for rules proposed with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the SEC said in a statement. The rules,
proposed in December 2010, will define the terms “swap
dealer,” “security-based swap dealer,” “major swap
participant,” “major security-based swap participant” and
“eligible contract participant,” the agency said.  The SEC staff expects that commissioners will consider the
adoption of rules defining the terms within the next several
weeks, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
