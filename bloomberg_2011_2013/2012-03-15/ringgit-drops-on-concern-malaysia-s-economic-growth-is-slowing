Malaysia’s ringgit fell to a seven-
week low on concern growth in  Southeast Asia ’s third-biggest
economy is slowing.  Industrial output rose 0.2 percent in January from a year
earlier after increasing 2.9 percent in December, official data
showed this week. Consumer prices advanced 2.3 percent in
February from a year earlier, the slowest pace since December
2010, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News before figures due on March 21.  “There will be an economic slowdown given the global
environment,” said Hasdi Mamat, a foreign-exchange trader at
Bank Muamalat in Kuala Lumpur. “It’s a question of how sharp
the slowdown will be to justify a rate cut. Fundamentally, this
will weigh on the  currency market .”  The ringgit declined 0.4 percent to 3.0665 per dollar as of
9:02 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 3.0710, the weakest level since Jan. 26.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, rose 39 basis points, or 0.39
percentage point, to 8.29 percent.  Bank Negara Malaysia, which held its benchmark rate
unchanged at 3 percent on March 9, is scheduled to meet next on
May 11.  Five-year  government bonds  fell yesterday. The yield on the
4.262 percent notes due September 2016 rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 3.32 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
