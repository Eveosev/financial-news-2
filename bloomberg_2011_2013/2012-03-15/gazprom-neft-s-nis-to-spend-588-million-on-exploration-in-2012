Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS) , the
Serbian  oil company  controlled by  Russia ’s  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP) ,
will expand investments in Balkan exploration by 45 percent this
year as it seeks to expand business.  With active and potential fields in Serbia and exploration
targets in Romania, Hungary and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
Belgrade-based company plans to spend some 50 billion dinars
($588 million) looking for hydrocarbons in those countries in
2012, it said in an e-mailed statement today.  In Serbia alone, it will spend around 450 million euros
($587 million) through 2020, it added.  NIS has already invested 785 million dinars in new
machinery for geological and seismic data, which will help it
provide “greater competitiveness and expansion of business
arrangements in the European Union.”  In Romania, NIS cooperates with Canada’s  East West
Petroleum Corp. (EW)  on at least two exploration wells. With a
 subsidiary  of  Falcon Oil & Gas Ltd (FO) ,  a Denver, Colorado-based
company, NIS seeks a partnership in Hungary for a  gas field 
where Falcon holds the license.  In Hungary, it also works with a unit of Austria’s Rohoel
Aufsuchungs AG, on a location near  Kiskunhalas , while in Bosnia-
Herzegovina it is looking for oil and gas with Neftegazinkor, a
subsidiary of Russia’s  Zarubezhneft (ZRNFT) .  To contact the reporter on this story:
