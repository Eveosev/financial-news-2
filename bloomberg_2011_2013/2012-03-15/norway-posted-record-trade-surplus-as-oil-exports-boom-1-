Norway ’s trade surplus grew to a
record 45.3 billion kroner ($7.8 billion) in February, as rising
petroleum prices boosted oil and gas exports.  The world’s seventh-largest oil exporter saw its trade
surplus surge by an annual 53.6 percent last month,  Statistics
Norway  said in a statement today. Exports rose 25 percent to
84.5 billion kroner.  “The price per barrel was 692 kroner this month, compared
to 603 kroner in February last year,” the agency said.  “This
represents the third highest oil price in kroner ever registered
-- close to the all time high in the summer of 2008.”  Norway, home to oil producer Statoil ASA, has withstood
 Europe ’s debt crisis as higher crude prices spur record
investments this year in offshore oil and gas fields. Petroleum
spending will rise to 186 billion kroner this year, a quarterly
survey from the country’s Statistics office showed this month.  Norway exported crude oil for 30.6 billion kroner in
February, up 25 percent from a year earlier. Exported volumes
rose to 44.2 million barrels from 40.7 million barrels in the
same month last year.  The exported value of natural gas in February was 22.9
billion kroner, down by 1.3 billion kroner from January when the
country shipped a record amount of gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
