BP Plc (BP/)  is expanding investment in
Namibia by buying into  Serica Energy Plc (SQZ) ’s offshore blocks as
explorers seek oil under a layer of salt off the African coast.  BP will take 30 percent of the Namibian license, cover past
costs and pay for a 3D seismic survey, London-based Serica said
today in a statement. Serica has signed a contract for seismic
surveys of the Luderitz Basin blocks, it said separately.  The transaction follows BP’s agreement with  Chariot Oil &
Gas Ltd. (CHAR)  in August to buy into Namibian blocks. Companies are
exploring under a salt layer off  Africa ’s Atlantic shore that
may hold 75 billion barrels of resources.  Cobalt International
Energy Inc. (CIE)  said in January it found a 1,180-foot (360-meter)
column of oil off the coast of  Angola , to the north of  Namibia .  “With BP now participating in the exploration effort, we
are able to make a very fast start to what is likely to be a
considerable and potentially very rewarding exploration
program,” Serica Chief Executive Officer Tony Craven Walker
said in the statement.  Serica rose 7.7 percent in London trading to 31.5 pence,
the highest close since May. BP fell 1.3 percent to 492.75
pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
