Investment returns at  China ’s
 national pension fund  fell 77 percent last year after the
country’s stock market tumbled as economic growth slowed and the
government tightened lending to curb  inflation .  Investment gains were 7.4 billion yuan ($1.2 billion), or
0.85 percent, the National Council for Social Security Fund said
in a  statement  on its website today without providing a growth
rate. That compares with the 32.1 billion yuan, or 4.22 percent,
for 2010, the fund reported a year ago.  Chairman  Dai Xianglong ’s fund, set up in August 2000 to
plug a funding gap in China’s pension system, joined China Life
Insurance Co. in suffering from a 22 percent slump last year in
the benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index. (SHCOMP)  Stock holdings returned
an annualized 18.6 percent since the fund started such
investments in June 2003, more than 10 percentage points higher
than the yield for the entire fund, according to the statement.  Stock investments, “as long as bought at reasonable
valuation levels and managed as long term investments, over the
long run, can still bring higher returns than fixed-income
products,” the fund said. The fund “will draw experience and
lessons from the past and stick to a very prudent stance on
stock investments.”  Realized investment gains totaled 43.1 billion yuan last
year, representing a 5.9 percent yield, while fair-value losses
stood at 35.7 billion yuan, according to the statement. The
government added 48.3 billion yuan to the fund last year,
bringing the total assets under management to 869 billion yuan.  Equities accounted for 32 percent of total assets as of Dec.
31, compared with an average proportion of 19 percent
historically, the fund said. Fixed-income products made up 51
percent, while another 16 percent of its portfolio was held in
industrial investments.  China Life (2628) , the nation’s biggest life insurer, said on
March 6 that net income for 2011 may drop 40 percent to 50
percent due to lower investment yields and impairment losses
stemming from swings in the  capital markets .  --Zhang Dingmin. Editors: Tomoko Yamazaki, Andreea Papuc  To contact the Bloomberg News staff for this story:
