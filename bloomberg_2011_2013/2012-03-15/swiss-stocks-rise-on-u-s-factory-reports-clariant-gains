Swiss stocks  climbed, extending a
nine-month high, after the  International Monetary Fund  approved
a loan for  Greece  and reports showed that jobless claims
declined and manufacturing expanded in the U.S.  Clariant AG (CLN) , the world’s biggest maker of printing-ink
chemicals, increased 3.5 percent, following chemical shares
higher.  Vontobel Holding AG (VONN) , the Swiss bank that specializes in
derivatives, advanced 1.5 percent.  Temenos Group AG (TEMN)  jumped 5
percent after the banking-software maker announced its forecast
for 2012 and Bankhaus Metzler advised buying the stock.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  rose 0.5 percent to 6,332.22 at the
close in Zurich, its highest level since June 6. The gauge has
 rallied 6.7 percent  this year after the European Central Bank
disbursed more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) to the
region’s lenders. The broader Swiss Performance Index also
increased 0.5 percent today.  “The European crisis is far from over, but for now, the
relative economic outperformance in the U.S. takes center stage
for investors and leads to optimism in the markets,” said Nils Rosendahl, an analyst at  Nordea Markets  in Stockholm.  The number of shares changing hands on the SMI was 12
percent lower than the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The SMI extended gains after the IMF approved a 28 billion-
euro loan for Greece as part of a second bailout organized by
the European Commission and the  European Central Bank . The IMF
will make 1.65 billion euros available immediately as a four-
year loan.  U.S. Jobless Claims  In the U.S., a Labor Department report showed that the
number of Americans applying for  jobless benefits  fell to
351,000 last week, from a revised 365,000 a week earlier.
Economists had forecast 357,000, according to the  median
forecast  in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s general economic
gauge, the so-called  Empire State index , unexpectedly increased
to 20.2 in March from 19.5 in February. A measure of
manufacturing in the Philadelphia area climbed to 12.5 last
month, exceeding the  average analyst estimate  for a reading of
12 in a survey compiled by Bloomberg News.  The Swiss government raised its economic growth forecast
for this year and said the country will not enter a recession.
 Switzerland ’s  gross domestic product  will increase 0.8 percent
this year instead of a previously projected 0.5 percent, the
State Secretariat for Economic Affairs in Bern said today. In
2013, the economy may expand 1.8 percent, down from a December
forecast of 1.9 percent.  Swiss National Bank  Switzerland’s central bank maintained the Swiss currency’s
ceiling at 1.20 francs per euro as the economy showed signs of
stabilization. The  Swiss National Bank  also kept its  benchmark
interest rate  at zero.  Clariant increased 3.5 percent to 12.94 Swiss francs as a
gauge of European chemical companies advanced. Vontobel climbed
1.5 percent to 24.40 francs.  Temenos jumped 5 percent to 15.80 francs after the banking-
software maker  predicted revenue  of $450 million to $500 million
and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $85 million
to $110 million in 2012.  Ulrich Trabert, an analyst at Bankhaus Metzler, raised the
stock to buy from sell.  UBS, Credit Suisse  UBS AG (UBSN)  and Credit Suisse AG, Switzerland’s two biggest
lenders, advanced 1.3 percent to 13.19 Swiss francs and 1.9
percent to 26.81 francs, respectively.  Bucher Industries AG (BUCN) , the agricultural machinery maker,
added 1 percent to 197.80 francs after it said full-year profit
jumped 30 percent to 127 million francs ($138 million). Bucher
also proposed a  dividend  of 4 francs, topping the Bloomberg
forecast for a payout of 3.80 francs.  “In our view, Bucher remains one of the very few
attractive European names available for investors to play the
longer-term agricultural equipment growth story,” Stefan Gaechter, an analyst at Helvea AG, wrote in a note to clients
today. “We see more upside than downside to our estimates.”  Dufry Group (DUFN)  AG rallied 3.4 percent to 118.90 francs, its
highest price since January 2011, after Helvea analyst Michael Heider raised his price estimate for the operator of duty-free
shops to 140 francs from 130 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
