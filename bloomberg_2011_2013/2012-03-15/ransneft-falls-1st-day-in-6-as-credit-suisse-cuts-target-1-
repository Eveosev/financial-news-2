OAO Transneft (TRNFP)  fell for the first
time in six days as Credit Suisse Group AG cut its price target,
saying investors are “overly optimistic” a stake in the state-
owned pipeline monopoly will be sold and dividends increased.  The preferred shares slumped 4 percent to 55,697 rubles at
the close in Moscow, paring a 16 percent advance since March 6.  Credit Suisse cut its price target 23 percent to 31,633
rubles and reiterated an underperform rating, Anton Rozanov
wrote in an e-mailed note today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
