Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s largest producing region, will rise to the
highest in two years as crops recover from damage caused by bad
weather, researcher Datagro Ltd. said.  Sugar output is estimated at 33.8 million metric tons for
the crop year that starts April 1, Plinio Nastari, president of
Barueri, Brazil-based Datagro said of the firm’s first estimate
for production of the sweetener in the coming harvest. It will
climb from 31.2 million tons in the year ending March 31, he
told reporters today in Sao Paulo.  Cane output in the region that produces about 90 percent of
Brazil’s sugar and ethanol will be higher than expected after
plantations recovered from freezing weather last year and a
drought in 2010.  Growers in the Center South will harvest 518.3 million tons
of sugar cane in the coming crop, more than the 460 million to
515 million estimated in a Nov. 21 report, Nastari said. The
region produced 493 million tons of sugar cane in the crop year
ending this month.  Ethanol output in the region is forecast at 21.8 billion
liters for the next crop, up from 20.6 billion liters. The
region will turn 48.9 percent of its sugar cane into sweetener
and the remainder into ethanol, up from 48.3 percent in the
current crop year.  Brazil, which accounts for about half of global shipments
of sugar, will export 26.35 million tons of the sweetener in the
next crop, Nastari said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
