The chairman of the Organization
for Islamic Cooperation will discuss coordinating humanitarian
aid to  Syria  with the  United Nations  and the U.S., Hurriyet
 reported .  President Bashar al-Assad’s government told the OIC in a
letter that they would consent to coordination of aid efforts by
the 57-nation bloc, according to the Istanbul-based newspaper.
Chairman Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu will meet UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  during a
visit to the U.S., Hurriyet reported.  Following Ihsanoglu’s visit, the OIC will send a delegation
of five people to Syria to identify needs and discuss the
procedures for delivering aid, the newspaper said. The group
will demand “unhindered access,” it said.  More than 7,500 Syrians have died in Assad’s yearlong
crackdown on dissent, according to UN estimates. The world body
is preparing food aid to last 1.5 million people for 90 days,
Hurriyet reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
