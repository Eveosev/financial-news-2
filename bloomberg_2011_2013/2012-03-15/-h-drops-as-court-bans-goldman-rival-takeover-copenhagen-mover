H+H International A/S (HH) , which has
been resisting a takeover from a rival controlled by Goldman
Sachs Capital Partners since 2010, fell the most in 16 months in
Copenhagen after a German court said it would prohibit a merger.  H+H fell as much as 21 percent, the most since November
2010, making it today’s  biggest loser  in the Copenhagen all-
share index. The stock declined 11 kroner, or 20 percent, to
44.50 kroner at 9:54 a.m. in  Denmark ’s capital.  The Danish maker of lightweight concrete said late
yesterday the Bundeskartellamt issued a decision saying it would
block Xella International GmbH taking over H+H within the German
market. Copenhagen-based H+H said it will continue to pursue its
strategy on “a stand-alone basis” even if Xella, which is
controlled by Goldman’s private equity unit and Pai Partners,
decides to appeal the court’s decision.  “After rejecting Xella’s contemplated takeover offer in
November 2010, the board of directors embarked on a turnaround
process for H+H which is now well under way,” the Danish
company said. Xella had submitted a pre-merger notification with
H+H to competition authorities in the E.U. and  Germany  without
the involvement of H+H, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
