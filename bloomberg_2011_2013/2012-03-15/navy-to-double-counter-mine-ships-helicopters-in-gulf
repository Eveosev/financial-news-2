(Corrects helicopter designation in second and fifth
paragraphs.)  The U.S. Navy will double the
number of counter-mine ships in the  Persian Gulf  to eight,
Admiral Jonathan Greenert, the chief of naval operations, said
today.  The Navy will also send four more MH-53 mine-sweeping
helicopters to the Gulf, Greenert told the Senate Armed Services
Committee.  Some Iranian officials have threatened to close the Strait
of Hormuz, transit point for a fifth of the oil traded
worldwide.  “To improve our mine-warfare capabilities, we are moving
four more mine sweeps to the theater,” Greenert told the panel.
“That’ll take it to eight. We are moving airborne mine-
countermeasure helicopters -- that’ll take us to eight in
theater and then those, working with the British mine sweeps,
there, which we exercise with frequently, sets us up a little
bit there.”  The MH-53 helicopters are made by Sikorsky Aircraft Corp.,
a unit of  United Technologies Corp. (UTX)  of Hartford,  Connecticut .  Greenert told reporters after the hearing the four
additional mine-sweeping vessels would come from the Navy’s base
in  San Diego .  He declined to say specifically when the deployments will
take place, other than commenting “soon.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
