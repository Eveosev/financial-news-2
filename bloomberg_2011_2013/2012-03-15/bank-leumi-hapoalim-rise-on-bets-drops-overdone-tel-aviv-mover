Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  and  Bank
Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI)  advanced on bets declines in the past year were
overdone after the central bank published capital ratio
guidelines that were lower than expected.  Bank Leumi , the country’s largest bank by assets,  climbed 
2.3 percent to 11.44 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv ,
after rising 5.5 percent yesterday. Bank Hapoalim Ltd. gained
2.1 percent to 13.63 shekels after surging 6.7 percent
yesterday. Israel’s  benchmark stock index  fell 0.2 percent
today.  The Bank of Israel published draft guidelines that set a
minimum core ratio of 9 percent for all banks in Israel to be
implemented by Jan. 1, 2015. The regulator recommended a minimum
ratio of 10 percent for Leumi and Hapoalim as of Jan. 1, 2017.
Investors were expecting guidelines in the range of 10 to 11
percent.  “The cloud of uncertainty that was hanging over the shares
in the past nine months, when people started to talk about
higher capital ratio requirements, has been lifted,” said Zach Herzog, equity sales trader at Psagot Investment House Ltd. in
Tel Aviv. “Israeli banks are more attractive versus their
foreign peers. This is just the beginning of a rally.”  Leumi shares are valued at 7.8 times  estimated  2012
earnings and Hapoalim has a multiple of 7.4, compared with 11.3
for the MSCI World Financials Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Leumi’s valuation discount versus the MSCI gauge
reached 34 percent on March 13, the biggest gap since Nov. 30.  Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT)  increased 1.9 percent to 5.075
shekels.  Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF)  advanced 1.4 percent today,
after climbing 8 percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
