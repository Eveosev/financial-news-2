Big Buck’s held off Voler La
Vedette to win his record fourth consecutive World Hurdle, the
main race on the third day of the Cheltenham horse racing
festival.  Big Buck’s, the 5-6 favorite ridden by Ruby Walsh and
trained by Paul Nicholls, withstood a late charge from 20-1
choice Voler La Vedette to win by 1 3/4 lengths. Smad Place (20-
1) was seven lengths back in third.  “He’s an amazing horse,” Walsh told the U.K.’s Channel 4.
“He went a good gallop and sprinted off the bend when he got to
the running rail. He’s just a great horse and thank God I ride
him.”  It was the 16th straight hurdles win for Big Buck’s,
matching the record of Sir Ken in the 1950s. The 9-year-old last
year tied Inglis Devers -- which won in 2005, 2007 and 2008 --
with three World Hurdle victories.  Other winners today were Sir Des Champs in the Novices’
Chase, Cape Tribulation in the Pretemps Final, Riverside Theatre
in the Ryanair Chase, Salut Flo in Handicap Chase and
Sunnyhillboy in the Challenge Cup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
