The following companies had unusual
price changes in Argentine trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and share prices are as of the close in  Buenos
Aires .  The  Merval (MERVAL)  Index rose 1.3 percent to 2,744.09.  Banco Macro SA (BMA)   advanced 3.1 percent to 10.25
pesos, the biggest increase in a month. Argentina’s largest
lender by market share rose in line with global equities, as
reports on manufacturing and jobless claims in the U.S.
bolstered optimism about the economy.  YPF SA (YPFD)   added 4.2 percent to 138 pesos, its
biggest increase in two weeks. Argentina’s largest oil company
is rising as local and foreign investment funds repurchase the
stock after a recent sell-off caused by political uncertainty,
Mariano Tavelli, president of Buenos Aires-based brokerage
Tavelli & Cia, said in a telephone interview. The provinces of
Chubut and Santa Cruz yesterday pulled four oilfield licenses,
saying YPF hasn’t invested enough.  To contact the reporter on this story:
