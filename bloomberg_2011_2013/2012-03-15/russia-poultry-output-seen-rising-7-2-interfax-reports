Russia’s poultry output may rise
7.2 percent to 3.4 million metric tons this year as more than 50
percent of leading domestic producers are planning to operate at
full capacity, Interfax said, citing the country’s Union of
Poultry Producers.  Poultry production is set to advance to 816,800 tons in the
first quarter, from 717,100 tons a year earlier, Interfax said,
citing Galina Bobyleva, head of the union. Output was 3.17
million tons in 2011. It may be 4.5 million tons in 2020 and
consumption is expected to increase to 30 kilograms (66 pounds)
per person that year from 24.6 kilograms last year, she said,
according to Interfax.  To contact the reporter on this story:
