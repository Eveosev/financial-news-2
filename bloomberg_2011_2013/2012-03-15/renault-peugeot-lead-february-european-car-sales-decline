European car sales dropped the most
in more than a year, led by  Renault SA (RNO)  and  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) 
as consumers shied away from purchases amid a weak economy.  Registrations in February fell 9.2 percent from a year
earlier to 923,381 vehicles, the fifth consecutive monthly drop,
Brussels- based  European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association ,
or ACEA, said today in a statement. The decline was the steepest
since a 16 percent drop in October 2010. Two-month sales fell
7.8 percent to 1.93 million vehicles.  Sales in  France ,  Europe ’s second-biggest market after
Germany, plummeted 20 percent, while deliveries in  Italy , its
third-biggest, plunged 19 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and
 Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  are predicting a contraction of
about 5 percent in Europe this year, the fifth straight annual
decline, as the sovereign-debt crisis prompts consumers to rein
in spending.  “The French manufacturers are struggling because the
French economy is weaker than it was a year ago, and Fiat is
being hit by the very weak Italian market,” said  Jonathon Poskitt , head of European sales forecasting at LMC Automotive in
Oxford. “The premium brands like BMW and Audi are holding up
fairly well, partly because the German economy, where they
operate strongly, is outperforming most of western Europe.”  Carmaker Consolidation Seen  Renault Chief Executive Officer  Carlos Ghosn  said March 6
he expects more consolidation among carmakers as “nobody can
afford alone the amount of investment required in this
industry.” European sales by Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based
Renault tumbled 24 percent to 86,402 cars, according to the
ACEA.  Peugeot, Europe’s second-biggest carmaker after  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) , announced plans Feb. 29 to team up with  General Motors Co. (GM) 
in a bid to turn around its loss-making operations. The Paris-
based carmaker’s sales in Europe fell 17 percent to 118,381
vehicles.  Renault fell as much as 1.7 percent and was down 1.5
percent at 42.38 euros at 9:02 a.m. local time in Paris, while
Peugeot declined 0.4 percent to 13.06 euros.  Fiat  Fiat, whose mass-market brands lost about 500 million euros
in the region last year, is looking for a partner in Europe to
cut costs and share technology as it doesn’t see a recovery in
the market before 2014. Fiat’s European sales dropped 17 percent
to 66,249 autos.  European sales at Volkswagen, the region’s biggest
carmaker, fell 2.1 percent to 220,799 vehicles, including a 1.2
percent decline at the company’s Audi brand.  Daimler AG (DAI) , whose Mercedes-Benz division is the world’s
third-biggest luxury-vehicle maker after BMW and Audi, posted
the biggest gain among the major European-based carmakers, with
sales rising 5.2 percent to 44,959 vehicles. BMW fell 0.3
percent to 49,722 autos.  Registrations in  Germany , Europe’s largest auto market
accounting for almost one in four cars sold in the region, was
unchanged at 224,318 registrations. It was the only major market
not to decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
