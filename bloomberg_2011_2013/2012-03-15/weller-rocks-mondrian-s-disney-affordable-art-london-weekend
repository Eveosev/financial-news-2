Joan Baez brings her folk guitar,
vibrato voice and 21st-century song adaptations to London.  Baez, who has added the environment to her list of causes,
performs recent material by Ryan Adams and Natalie Merchant --
alongside renderings of  Bob Dylan ,  Leonard Cohen  and Woody Guthrie, some of which she’s been doing for a good 50 years.  Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, Belvedere Road, SE1
8XX, Friday and Saturday. Information: +44-20-7960-4200,
 http://www.joanbaez.com  and  http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/   Saturday  Mondrian, the artist known for his rigorous grids, had a
soft spot for “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.”  He mailed his brother a postcard of the Disney cartoon --
signed “Sleepy” -- which you can see in “ Mondrian Nicholson
In Parallel ” at the  Courtauld  Gallery. The exhibition focuses
on the two years from 1938 to 1940 that Mondrian spent in London
at painter Ben Nicholson’s invitation.  The Dutchman moved into a whitewashed Belsize Park room and
took a shine to the capital, eagerly reading the Evening
Standard and asking about nightclubs where he could go dancing.
As the aerial bombing of  London  started, Mondrian moved to  New
York , where he died less than four years later.  “Mondrian Nicholson in Parallel” ends May 20 at the
Courtauld Gallery,  Somerset House , WC2R 0RN. Information:

him in “Bingo,” now at the Old Vic starring  Patrick Stewart 
(from “ Star Trek ”). When Shakespeare’s rich neighbor decides
to swallow up a bunch of small farmers’ plots, the Bard sides
with him -- making sure his own assets are secure.  Stewart puts on a strong performance as Shakespeare in late
life, lost in existential thought, getting angry and keeping a
permanent distance from his wife and nagging daughter.  “Bingo” is at the Young Vic, 66 The Cut, SE1 8LZ.

pounds ($62.70).  The Affordable Art Fair comes to Battersea Park, with 120
galleries selling paintings, sculptures, prints and photographs
priced no more than 4,000 pounds. There are talks and
printmaking workshops, too.  The fair ends Sunday. Information:

worth the exercise. It’s the latest brasserie from the team that
owns Terroirs, near  Trafalgar Square , and Brawn, in the East
End. Expect earthy food with strong flavors, and biodynamic
wines that, at their most polite, might remind you of a
farmyard. Information: +44-20-7223-11. (No website.)  Sunday Night  With his graying hair and double-breasted suits, Paul Weller looks increasingly like British rock’s elder statesman.
Yet his sweaty pop makes him more of an enfant terrible. Both
facets will be in evidence during the 53-year-old’s five-night
residency at the Roundhouse from Sunday. Expect a preview of his
new album “Sonik Kicks” and tracks by his former band the Jam.  March 18 through 22 at Roundhouse, Chalk Farm Road, NW1
8EH. Information:  http://www.roundhouse.org.uk , +44-844-482-8008
or  http://www.paulweller.com/   Lemonia is a family-style Greek restaurant a stroll away
from the Roundhouse. The food is simple and inexpensive, and
there are so many regulars from Primrose Hill, it’s best to
book. Information: +44-20-7586-7454. (No website.)  To contact the writer on the story:
