Spain  and France sold 13.04 billion
euros ($17 billion) of debt, with borrowing costs falling as the
the  European Central Bank ’s increased lending spurred demand and
eclipsed a second year of deficit slippage in Spain.  Yields fell and demand rose at the first Spanish auction
since Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  loosened the nation’s budget-
deficit goal for 2012. France issued 8.46 billion euros of
notes, at the top end of the range targeted by the treasury, and
1.58 billion euros of inflation-linked bonds.  “There is no indication here that Spain’s recent fiscal
slippage has served to put a dent in investor sentiment which,
in itself, continues to be buoyed by the ECB’s aggressive
liquidity provisioning,” said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-
income strategist at Rabobank International in London.  The ECB’s second Long Term Refinancing Operation, under
which its three-year lending reached 1.02 trillion euros in late
February, has eased the region’s debt crisis and alleviated
concern about slowing growth by giving banks the means to invest
in the region’s sovereign debt.  In the second such operation last month, 800 banks received
a total of 529.5 billion euros, more than the 470 billion euros
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and the 489 billion
euros of the first tender in December.  Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond yield rose to 5.163 basis
points after the auction as of 12:28 a.m. from 5.134 before the
sale. The spread over German bunds of the same maturity widened
5 basis points to 321 points.  France ’s 10-year yield rose 6.6
basis points to 2.98 percent.  Auction Details  Spain sold 3 billion euros of bonds, below the Treasury’s
maximum target of 3.5 billion euros. Notes maturing in April
2016 yielded an average 3.374 percent, down from 3.748 percent
when the securities were auctioned on Jan. 12, while bonds
maturing in January 2015 and July 2018 were sold to yield 2.44
percent and 4.193 percent respectively, the Madrid-based Bank of
Spain said today.  Demand for the notes maturing in April 2016 was 4.13 times
the amount sold, compared with 2.21 in January. The bid-to-cover
ratio for the 2015 bonds was 4.96 times and 2.91 for the 2018
bonds, which hadn’t been auctioned since 2008.  ‘Today was a test for demand, to check if it is still solid
despite worries about the country’s fiscal consolidation,” said
Annalisa Piazza, a fixed-income analyst at Newedge Group in
 London . “Spain already funded about 40 percent of its
requirement and might hold for benchmark auctions, which are
cheaper, to sell more.”  Spanish Budget  In the auction today, France sold 2.106 billion euros of
April 2014 notes at an average yield of 0.7 percent, lower than
the 1.14 percent on Sept. 15. It sold 1.93 billion euros of
October 2014 securities at a yield of 0.86 percent, below the
2.01 percent it paid on Jan. 20, and 1.165 billion euros in
February 2016 notes at an average yield of 1.4 percent compared
with 2.17 percent on Nov. 17.  Euro-area finance chiefs agreed this week Spain’s budget
deficit goal for 2012 was unachievable as the euro area’s
fourth-biggest economy is set to enter its second recession
since 2009.  Spain’s budget deficit was 8.5 percent of gross domestic
product last year, compared with a 6 percent target. For 2012,
European finance ministers agreed to ease the goal to 5.3
percent from an initial 4.4 percent.  Rajoy yesterday reiterated his support for the ECB’s three-
year loans to banks, saying they provided “great relief” to
the euro region. Banks based in Spain borrowed 152.4 billion
euros in February from the ECB, data showed today, the most on
record and almost half the amount taken by euro-region lenders
overall.  To contact the reporters on this story:
