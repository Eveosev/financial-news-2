Canadian  consumer confidence  has
risen from the previous month on reduced pessimism about how the
economy will perform according to a  Nanos Research  poll.  The Nanos Economic Mood Index for March rose to 107.8 from
104.6 in February, which was the lowest since 2009, according to
a report provided by  Nik Nanos , president of the Ottawa-based
polling company.  The balance of opinion on whether the economy will be
stronger or weaker in the next six months was negative 5.3 in
March compared with negative 8.4 in February, the Nanos poll
found, the third-straight improvement.  “Canadians still display cautious optimism regarding the
economy,” the report said.  The Expectations Index rose to 122.2 from 116.7, and the
Nanos Pocketbook Index, based on questions related to personal
finances and  job security , rose to 96 from 94.6 in February. The
Economic Mood index is a composite of the Pocketbook and
Expectations indexes.  The “net perception” of Canadians about whether local
real estate prices will rise in the next six months rose to 34.5
from 27.1. Net perception is calculated by subtracting the
percentage of those who say real estate values will fall from
the percentage of those who say they will rise.  The perception of job security fell to 43.9 from 45.5, the
report said, while the measure for personal finances over the
past year increased to negative 10.4 from negative 15.5 in
February.  The Nanos poll of 1,004 Canadians was taken between March 9
and March 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
