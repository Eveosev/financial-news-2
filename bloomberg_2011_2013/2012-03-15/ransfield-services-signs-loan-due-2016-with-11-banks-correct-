(Corrects story from March 14 after company corrects error
in its Feb. 22 regulatory filing regarding loan’s maturity
date.)  Transfield Services Ltd. (TSE)  signed a
three-part loan due 2016 with about 11 banks to refinance debt,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  and Westpac
Banking Corp. were the arranging banks and were joined by about
nine other lenders, including several financial institutions
from Asia, the data show.  Transfield said in a Feb. 22 regulatory filing that it had
“received credit commitments from existing lenders to extend
the full debt facility scheduled to mature in December 2012
until March 2016 and final documentation will be completed in
coming weeks.”  Following this extension, the group’s average debt maturity
profile will increase from 2.7 years to 3.6 years, according to
the Australian stock exchange statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
