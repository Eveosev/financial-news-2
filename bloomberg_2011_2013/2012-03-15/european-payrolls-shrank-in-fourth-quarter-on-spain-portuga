European  employment  decreased in
the fourth quarter as declines in hiring by companies in  Spain 
and  Portugal  offset gains in Germany.  Payrolls in the euro region fell 0.2 percent from the third
quarter, when they showed a similar drop, the European Union’s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today. Labor-cost growth
accelerated to 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter from 2.6
percent in the previous three months, a separate report showed.  In  Germany (GRGDPPGQ) , Europe’s largest economy, employment rose 0.3
percent from the third quarter. In Spain, which is struggling to
trim its budget shortfall to meet European Union targets,
employment dropped 1 percent, while Portuguese payrolls fell 2.7
percent.  For the euro region as a whole, an estimated 146.4 million
people were employed in the fourth quarter, the statistics
office said. From a year earlier, fourth-quarter payrolls
 declined  0.2 percent, it said.  For all of 2011, employment rose 0.2 percent in the euro
region and 0.3 percent in the EU, according to today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
