The Swiss franc strengthened for
the first time in four days against the euro after the central
bank raised its growth forecast at a policy meeting.  The currency climbed from a seven-week low against the
dollar as the  Swiss National Bank  predicted the economy will
expand 1 percent this year, twice as much as its previous
estimate. Policy makers led by interim Chairman Thomas Jordan,
maintained their ceiling for the currency at 1.20 francs per
euro, and pledged to defend the cap with their “utmost
determination.”  “With the global backdrop looking more encouraging, the
SNB is likely to take a steady-as-she-goes approach on policy
and maintain the current cap,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of
currency strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce in
London. “Risks of the euro debt crisis deteriorating mean
demand for the franc will be underpinned.”  The franc strengthened 0.1 percent to 1.2114 per euro at
10:32 a.m. in  London  after falling to 1.21469 yesterday, the
weakest since Jan. 10. The currency declined 0.2 percent to
92.85 centimes per dollar after dropping to 93.35, the lowest
level since Jan. 25.  The SNB forecast that consumer prices will fall 0.6 percent
this year, before inflation returns in 2013 with a rate of 0.3
percent, accelerating to 0.6 percent in 2014. The Zurich-based
central bank kept its benchmark  interest rate  at zero as
predicted by all 25 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The franc has declined 3.8 percent in the past six months,
the second worst performer after the yen, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which tracked performance of 10
developed-nation currencies.  Franc’s Surge  The currency surged as much as 37 percent against the euro
in the 12 months before the ceiling was introduced on Sept. 6 as
investors bought Swiss assets as a haven from the regional
financial crisis. The franc has traded between 1.20 and 1.25 per
euro since Sept. 7.  The SNB spent 17.8 billion francs last year to stem what it
called the currency’s “massive overvaluation.” That compared
with 144 billion francs it used in the previous year to buy
currencies, a policy that sparked a record loss.  Even after the cap was introduced, the Swiss currency is
still stronger against the euro than it was year ago,
highlighting the risk of deflation as costs for imported goods
drop. The price of foreign goods fell 3.4 percent in February
from a year ago.  Swiss  bonds  declined, with 10-year yields rising three basis
points to 0.89 percent.  Switzerland ’s government securities handed investors a loss
of 0.8 percent this year, paring gains in the past 12 months to
8.5 percent, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
