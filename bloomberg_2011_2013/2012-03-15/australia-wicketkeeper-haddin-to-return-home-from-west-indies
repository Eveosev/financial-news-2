Australia  wicketkeeper  Brad Haddin 
was granted leave to return home from the team’s cricket tour of
the West Indies because of personal reasons.  Wicketkeeper/batsman Peter Nevill will join the squad to
replace him and Haddin’s return will be determined at a later
date, head selector John Inverarity said.  “We hope that Brad will be able to rejoin the squad in the
West Indies in the not too distant future,” Inverarity said in
an e-mailed statement.  Haddin, who lost his place as Australia’s limited-overs
wicketkeeper to Matthew Wade, had been endorsed by selector Rod Marsh two days ago as the first-choice to keep wicket for
Australia in the opening Test starting April 7 in Barbados.  The 26-year-old Nevill, Haddin’s understudy at the New
South Wales state team, was selected by his peers as the
wicketkeeper in their All-Star team from the Australian domestic
season.  The one-day series between the teams starts today in  St.
Vincent .  To contact the reporter on this story:
