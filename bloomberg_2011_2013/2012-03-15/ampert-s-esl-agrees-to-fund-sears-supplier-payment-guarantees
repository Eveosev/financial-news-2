Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  Chairman
 Edward Lampert ’s ESL Investments Inc., seeking to reassure the
retailer’s suppliers, agreed to fund guarantees that vendors
would be paid in the event of a bankruptcy.  ESL in January agreed with an undisclosed financial
institution to buy a stake in contracts that pay suppliers for
their accounts receivable with Sears should the company seek
protection from creditors, the  Hoffman Estates , Illinois-based
retailer said a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission yesterday.  Lampert is seeking to show suppliers that Sears is safe to
do business with after the retailer reported its largest
 quarterly loss  in at least nine years last month. Vendors’
confidence in Sears may have been rattled after CIT Group Inc.
in January told the retailer’s suppliers it would no longer
finance their orders.  Sears last month said it would split off about 1,250
smaller-format stores and sell 11 more locations to raise as
much as $770 million. The  company  had $747 million in  cash  and
near-cash items at the end of the fourth quarter, about 45
percent less than a year earlier.  Lampert and his funds control about 62 percent of Sears’s
shares.  Sears was little changed at at $79.98 at 9:41 a.m. in  New
York . The  shares  more than doubled this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
