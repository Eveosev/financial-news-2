TNK-BP, the Russian oil venture,
sold two cargoes of East Siberian Pacific Ocean crude, or ESPO,
for April loading, one each to  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and
Sinochem International Co., said four traders who declined to be

$3.20 to $4.10 a barrel to Middle East benchmark Dubai,
according to two of the traders.  OAO Surgutneftegas,  Russia â€™s fourth-largest oil producer,
was said to sell ESPO crude for loading in April at premiums of
about $3.80 to $4.30 a barrel to Dubai on March 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
