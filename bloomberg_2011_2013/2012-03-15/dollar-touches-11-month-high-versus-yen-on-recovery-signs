The yen weakened to an 11-month low
against the dollar as U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose for a
seventh day before reports that analysts said will indicate the
American economy is gathering momentum.  The yen declined against 13 of 16 major counterparts after
Asian stocks advanced for a third day, curbing demand for the
lower-yielding Japanese currency. U.S. data today will show
initial jobless claims decreased and a regional index of
manufacturing improved, according to economist estimates in
Bloomberg surveys.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa this
week indicated the central bank will keep using monetary policy
as a tool to tackle deflation.  “As U.S. yields rise so does dollar-yen but I would say
over the past few weeks the rises in dollar-yen have outpaced
the normal correlation,” said Jane Foley, a senior currency
strategist at Rabobank International in London. “The appetite
to sell the yen has been persistent for some time. That was
triggered not necessarily by Treasuries but by the perception
that the Japanese government is pulling out all the stops to
stimulate growth, including pressuring the Bank of  Japan .”  The yen slid to 84.18 per dollar, the weakest level since
April 13, before trading little changed at 83.67 at 9:49 a.m.
 London  time. The U.S. currency was 0.3 percent lower at $1.3066
per euro. It earlier appreciated to $1.3004, the strongest level
since Feb. 16. The yen depreciated 0.2 percent to 109.32 per
euro.  The 10-year Treasury yield rose three basis points to 2.30
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
