Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is being investigated
by Brazil’s oil regulator for not meeting the agency’s request
for safeguards to avoid new leaks after a November spill at the
Frade field off the coast of Brazil.  Chevron faces fines for its handling of the spill after the
probe is completed, an official at the agency, who declined to
be named because of agency policy, said in a telephone
interview.  Chevron has requested permission from the regulator, known
as the  ANP , to halt production at Frade after a new oil slick of
about 5 liters appeared at the field this week, Rafael
Williamson, a corporate affairs director at Chevron, said at a
press conference in  Rio de Janeiro  today.  Frade was Brazil’s 12th-largest producing field in January
with 65,000 barrels a day in oil and natural gas output,
according to information on the regulator’s website. Chevron
holds a 52 percent stake in Frade and is the operator. Partners
include  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  with 30 percent and Frade Japao
Petroleo Ltda. -- a joint venture of  INPEX Corp. (1605) ,  Sojitz Corp. (2768) 
and JOGMEC -- with 18.26 percent.  Chevron fell 0.6 percent to $110.03 at the close in New
York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
