Libya ’s state-run National Oil
Corp. exported 70.9 million barrels of oil from Jan. 1 to March
13, the company said on its website today.  Libya’s domestic crude consumption in the same period was
8.29 million barrels, Tripoli-based NOC said. Of the quantity
shipped, Italy received 25.5 million barrels, the largest single
share of the total, followed by  China , which took 13.5 million
barrels, the company said.  Separately, NOC’s partners shipped a total of 9.57 million
barrels in the same period, according to NOC.  Libya, holder of Africa’s biggest crude reserves, is
seeking to raise output and exports, which were disrupted last
year by the armed rebellion against Muammar Qaddafi’s regime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
