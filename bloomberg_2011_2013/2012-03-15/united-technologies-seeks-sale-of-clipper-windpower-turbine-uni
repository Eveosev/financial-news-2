United Technologies Corp. (UTX) , the
industrial conglomerate, is seeking a buyer for Clipper
Windpower a year after taking control of the struggling turbine
maker.  United Technologies is selling Clipper, along with other
units, to raise $3 billion for its purchase of  Goodrich Corp. (GR) ,
the Hartford, Connecticut-based company said today in a
statement.  United Technologies decided to sell the “non-core” wind
business, based in Carpinteria, California, as it reevaluates
its portfolio, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Louis Chenevert said in the statement.  United Technologies bought the 51 percent of Clipper it
didn’t already own for $222 million in October 2010, after
reduced orders left the wind company struggling to finance
operations.  Clipper abandoned plans in August to build the world’s
largest turbine, the 10-megawatt offshore Brittania model to
focus on land-based products.  United Technologies  is classifying Clipper as a
discontinued operation. The wind unit declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
