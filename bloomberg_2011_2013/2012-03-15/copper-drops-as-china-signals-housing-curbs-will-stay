Copper rose for the second time in
three days amid more signs that the economy is recovering in the
U.S., the world’s second-biggest user of the metal.  Manufacturing in the  New York  region expanded in March at
the fastest pace since June 2010, and a Philadelphia-area
factory index grew at the quickest rate in 11 months, regional
Federal Reserve bank data showed today. A Labor Department
report showed  claims  for jobless benefits matching the lowest in
four years, and the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index topped 1,400 for
the first time since 2008.  “The U.S. is showing some growth, and it’s a trend now,”
Frank Cholly, a senior commodity broker at RJO Futures in
 Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “You always need a
steady diet of good news to feed a  bull market , and for as long
as we have that, equities will continue to rally, and copper
will follow.”  Copper futures for May delivery advanced 1.3 percent to
settle at $3.8975 a pound at 1:25 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
The metal has climbed 13 percent this year.  Inventories monitored by the  London  Metal Exchange have
dropped 28 percent this year to the lowest since July 2009.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months rose 1.2
percent to $8,565 a metric ton ($3.89 a pound).  Aluminum, lead and zinc also gained in London, while nickel
and tin fell.  China  is the biggest consumer of industrial metals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
