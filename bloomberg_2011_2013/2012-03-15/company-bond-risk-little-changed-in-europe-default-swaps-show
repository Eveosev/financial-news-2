The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt was little changed, according
to BNP Paribas SA.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 1.5 basis
points to 553.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies
with investment-grade ratings fell one to 125.5. A decline
signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers was unchanged at 200 basis points and the
subordinated index was fell one to 340.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
