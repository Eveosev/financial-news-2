Residual-fuel (SPIVRESD)  inventories in
Singapore,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center,
climbed 2.3 percent to the highest in 10 months, according to a
unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy
residue and excluding bitumen rose 500,000 barrels in the week
to yesterday to 21.9 million,  International Enterprise Singapore 
said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the highest since
the seven days ended May 18.  Middle-distillate (SPIVMDIS)  inventories including gasoil, or diesel,
and kerosene dropped 992,000 barrels, or 8.8 percent, to 10.3
million, based on the ministry’s data. That’s the biggest
decline in seven weeks.  Supplies of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate fell 956,000 barrels, or 8.6 percent, to 10.1
million. That’s the lowest in six weeks.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
