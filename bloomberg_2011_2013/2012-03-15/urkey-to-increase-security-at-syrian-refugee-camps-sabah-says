Turkey  is increasing security at
camps housing more than 13,000 Syrians, seeking to protect
refugees from President Bashar al-Assad’s intelligence agents as
they flee the violence, Sabah  reported , citing decisions taken
at a security summit in Istanbul.  The police department is setting up fingerprint-access to a
new camp with container-housing in the southeastern province of
Kilis, the Istanbul-based newspaper said. Turkish authorities
will also use X-ray machines to screen goods entering the area,
which will be under around-the-clock surveillance, it said.  The measures are put in place to thwart attempts to kidnap
Syrian dissidents and former military officials from Turkey,
Sabah reported. Turkish officials previously foiled two bids by
 Syria ’s Mukhabarat intelligence agency to seize defectors.  Until now, Turkey has been housing Syrians escaping the
violence in tent camps close to the border in Hatay province,
where at least 765 people sought refuge yesterday, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
