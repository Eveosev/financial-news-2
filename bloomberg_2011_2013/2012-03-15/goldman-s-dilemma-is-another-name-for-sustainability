Yesterday a London employee of Goldman Sachs penned a 1,200-word  opinion
piece  in the  New York Times  alleging that top managers in the company
ridicule and take advantage of their clients.  Greg Smith  wrote of the investment
bank where he worked for 12 years that he no longer liked the "trajectory of its
culture" and quit his job. The piece sparked a storm of  criticism  and  debate  on
 Wall Street . "People who care only about making money will not sustain this
firm” or the trust of its clients "for very much longer," Smith concludes. The Smith episode lies close to the heart of sustainability, a point echoed
in his likely inadvertent word choice. That's because much of sustainability, or
responsibility, or whatever companies choose to call it, essentially boils down
to corporate governance. Forces external to a company can reveal blind spots in management's
assessment of risks and opportunities. Pressure on companies to divest from
investments in  South Africa  in the 1980s is one example. Companies ill-prepared
for a low-carbon economy might now feel punished by high  oil prices  and
increasingly costly regulation. What does the Smith controversy have to do with social justice and
environmental preservation? Not much. But it has everything to do with blind
spots and mitigating risk to a company's reputation. Smith's is an attack on
Goldman Sachs's corporate governance, a category that includes, but isn't
limited to, environmental and social issues. Corporate governance and
transparency rightfully takes up more space in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index ranking questionnaire than either of the other topics, to pick just one
measure. Goldman Sachs was  admitted  into the Index in July. Jason Kennedy , CEO of the Kennedy Group, a London-based recruitment firm,
told Bloomberg  news  that Smith may have aired a few comments that are true, but
he's placed himself on a pedestal. The reason he's been at Goldman Sachs for 12
years is that he liked the name and probably liked the money. That is true,
simply by virtue of Smith showing up for work. But the point here for managers -
- and the driver of some companies into sustainability strategy -- is that Smith
stopped liking the name so much that he waived the money and tattled in
public. "Sustainable" companies attract and retain employees by being good companies.
That means being responsive to the needs of clients, shareholders, employees and
the communities they interact with. Bright people are often willing to work for
less money if an employer's values align with their own. Greg Smith is probably
now one of them. Visit  www.bloomberg.com/sustainability  for the latest from Bloomberg News
