Ghana ’s savings in two oil funds
reached $69.2 million in 2011, the first year of production of
crude for export, the central bank  said  on its website today.  A stabilization fund, meant for use in times of price
volatility, was given $54.8 million while a heritage fund for
future generations received $14.4 million, according to the
Accra-based  Bank of Ghana .  The stabilization fund was invested in a three-month
instrument and made returns worth $32,471, while the heritage
fund, which was invested for six months, yielded $39,207, it
said. It didn’t say where the money was invested.  The allocations were made from proceeds of crude sales
belonging to the state, valued at $444.1 million last year.
Ghana extracted oil four times last year and gave money from the
proceeds to the funds three of those times, the bank said
without giving reason.  Ghana, West Africa’s second-biggest economy, began
production at the off-shore Jubilee oil field on Dec. 15, 2010.
Daily production will average between 70,000 barrels and 90,000
barrels this year, field operator  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  said on Jan.
