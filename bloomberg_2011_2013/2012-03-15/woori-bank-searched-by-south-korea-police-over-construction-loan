Woori Bank (053000) , a unit of South Korea’s
biggest financial group by assets, was searched by police today
in an investigation involving two employees.  National Police Agency  officers visited Woori Bank’s
headquarters in  Seoul  and took documents related to 2006 lending
for a resort project, Woori Bank spokesman Han Seoung Chul said
by phone, without identifying the employees. The search was
about individual corruption and the bank didn’t find irregular
practices in the 2006 lending, the spokesman said.  Korean prosecutors indicted more than 100 people last year
after investigating savings banks that made loans for
construction projects which soured amid a real estate slump.
Lenders including Woori have had to set aside higher provisions
against such projects since the 2008 financial crisis.  “I don’t think this one-time case of corruption by
individuals will affect Woori’s earnings or hurt investors’
sentiment,” Hwang Seok Kyu, an analyst at  Kyobo Securities Co. (030610) ,
said by phone in Seoul.  Five calls to the  National Police Agency  in Seoul went
unanswered.  Yonhap News reported earlier that police were investigating
whether the employees received bribes for lending about 135
billion won ($120 million).  Shares of Woori Finance Holdings Co., the bank’s parent
company, rose 2.3 percent to 13,300 won in Seoul today,
outperforming a 0.1 percent decline in the benchmark Kospi stock
index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
