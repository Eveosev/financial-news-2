Asian  stocks  swung between gains
and losses as Japanese exporters advanced after the dollar rose
against the yen ahead of reports forecast to show the U.S.
economic recovery is strengthening. Mining companies fell on
lower metal prices.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s biggest carmaker by market
value, rose 2.6 percent in  Tokyo . The top three contributors to
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index were Japanese exporters.  Ricoh Co. (7752) ,
an office-equipment maker, jumped 7.8 percent after Citigroup
Inc. raised its rating to “buy” from “neutral.”  Tencent
Holdings Ltd. (700) , a Chinese Internet company, gained 3.6 percent in
Hong Kong after its fourth-quarter profit gained. Australian
gold producer  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM)  slid 3.3 percent.  “The U.S. still seems to be slowly but surely improving,
and that’s definitely improving the mood of investors and
forcing them to focus on taking more risk to capture what looks
to be an improving outlook,” said  Tim Schroeders , who helps
manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd. in
Melbourne. “Perhaps we are seeing a sustained devaluation of
the yen, which would improve the outlook for Japanese exporters
in particular.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.1 percent to 127.34 as
of 2:21 p.m. in Tokyo, after falling as much as 0.3 percent.
Half of the gauge’s 10 industry groups declined.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  advanced 0.8 percent. The
yen weakened to as high as 84.18 per dollar today, the lowest
level since April. A lower yen boosts the value of Japanese
exporters’ overseas profits when repatriated.  Toyota rose 2.6 percent to 3,575 yen in Tokyo, while Honda
Motor Co., a carmaker that gets more than 80 percent of its
revenue overseas, increased 3 percent to 3,280 yen.  Gold Falls  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index (AS51)  dropped 0.2 percent as metal
producers declined on lower prices for commodities. Gold futures
for April delivery retreated 3 percent in  New York  yesterday,
while the London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial commodities including copper and aluminum lost 1.1
percent.  Newcrest Mining, Australia’s biggest gold producer, slid
3.3 percent to A$30.27 in Sydney.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, fell 1.2 percent to A$35.18. They were
the two of the three  biggest drags  on the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index.  Zhaojin Mining Industry Co., a Chinese gold producer,
dropped 5.9 percent to HK$13.40 in Hong Kong, the  steepest
decline  on the Asian benchmark gauge.  Korean, Chinese Stocks  South Korea’s Kospi Index was little changed. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index lost 0.2 percent as developers sank amid
speculation  China  will continue its efforts to curb property
prices. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, fell 0.3 percent.  Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said yesterday home prices
remain far from reasonable and relaxing curbs could cause
“chaos” in the market.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent
today. The index lost 0.1 percent in New York yesterday,
snapping a five-day advance that drove the benchmark gauge for
U.S. equities to the highest level since June 2008.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 12 percent this year
through yesterday as reports showed strength in the  U.S.
economy , and as China reduced reserve ratios for major banks
amid speculation it will further ease monetary policy. The gain
compares with 11 percent increases by the  S&P 500  and the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at
14.9 times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.4
times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600.  U.S. Jobs  The U.S. Labor Department may say today the number of
Americans applying for jobless benefits fell by 5,000 to 357,000
in the week ended March 10, according to economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News. An index of manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region may have increased to a reading of 12 in March from 10.2
the previous month, another estimate shows.  Ricoh rose 7.8 percent to 804 yen in Tokyo, the biggest
gain in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The company’s stock rating
was raised to “buy” by Citigroup analyst Masahiro Shibano on
expectation its profit for the next full-year will rebound.  Tencent gained 3.6 percent to HK$207.80 in  Hong Kong . The
company said its fourth-quarter profit rose 15 percent as it
