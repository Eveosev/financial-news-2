U.S. municipal-bond yields surged
for a second day to the highest in more than three months after
the  Federal Reserve  raised its assessment of the economy.  The  yield  on top-rated tax-exempt bonds due in 10 years
rose 7 basis points to 2.2 percent at 4:02 p.m. in New York, the
 highest  since Nov. 29, according to a Bloomberg Valuation Index.
The  30-year (BVMB30Y)  tax-exempt yield jumped 8 basis points, the most
since Jan. 24, to 3.46 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Treasury yields are at their highest since October after
Fed policy makers said March 13 that the labor market is
improving and strains in financial markets have eased. They
repeated that interest rates will probably stay low at least
through late 2014.  “Any time you get massive Treasury moves like yesterday,
munis are going to take a couple days to fall” in price, Hardy Manges, head of municipal trading at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities
in  New York , said in a telephone interview. Yields move in the
opposite direction of prices.  Ten-year Treasury yields surged 14 basis points yesterday
to 2.27 percent, the highest since Oct. 28. The seven-day rise
in yields is the longest streak since the nine days ended June
26, 2006. The yield rose  1 basis point  at 4:59 p.m.  Signs of Strength  Further signs of economic strengthen came today as
applications for  unemployment insurance  fell by 14,000 to
351,000 in the period ended March 10, the Labor Department said.
The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index improved to minus 33.7 from
minus 36.7 in the week ended March 11.  Companies have slowed the pace of firings and are expanding
their workforces as sales rise and the threat of financial
contagion from a European default diminishes. Job growth in
February capped the best six months since 2006, and the
 unemployment rate  stayed at 8.3 percent, a three-year low.  Municipal rates have lagged behind the jump in yields on
federal bonds. The 10-year benchmark tax-exempt yield was 96.5
percent of the  interest rate  on similar-maturity Treasuries,
less than the one-year average of 97.8 percent, Bloomberg data
show.  Investors use the ratio as a gauge of relative value: a
lower ratio means munis are more expensive relative to
Treasuries.  Declining Returns  Municipal bonds have returned 0.8 percent this month
through yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes tracking prices and coupon payments, putting them on
track for their worst month since January 2011, when they lost 1
percent. Munis returned 11.2 percent in 2011, beating
Treasuries, corporate debt, commodities and stocks.  Declines in muni bonds “will slow today, and my guess is
by tomorrow they’ll stop dropping,” Manges said.
“Substantially higher yields just in the last two weeks are
going to interest some different sets of buyers.”  The amount of local-government debt  scheduled  for sale in
the next 30 days is down 32 percent from the 2012 high of $11.4
billion on Feb. 28, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
