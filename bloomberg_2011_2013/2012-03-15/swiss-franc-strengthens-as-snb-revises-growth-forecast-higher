The franc strengthened against the
euro and the dollar after the central bank raised its forecast
for Swiss economic growth this year and kept its exchange-rate
limit against the 17-nation currency in place.  The franc appreciated 0.3 percent to 1.20999 per euro at
8:34 a.m. London time. It strengthened 0.2 percent to 92.84
centimes per dollar.  Swiss gross domestic product will expand 1 percent this
year, from a previous estimate for 0.5 percent growth, the SNB
said today in a statement. It left its limit for the franc
against the euro at 1.20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
