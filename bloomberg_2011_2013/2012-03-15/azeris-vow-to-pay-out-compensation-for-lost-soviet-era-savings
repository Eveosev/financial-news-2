Azerbaijan will compensate
depositors who lost their savings when the Soviet banking system
collapsed two decades ago, according to a government decree
signed by President  Ilham Aliyev  yesterday.  People who held retail accounts at the Azeri branch of the
 Soviet Union ’s savings bank can apply to Kapital Bank ASC for
compensation by the end of this year, the government said in the
decree, published by the country’s state news service Azartac.  The authorities will spend 400 million manat ($509 million)
to 500 million manat to return 4.8 billion Soviet-era rubles of
lost savings, said Qubad Ibadoglu, head of the Center for
Economic Studies in the Azeri capital, Baku, citing the research
group’s estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
