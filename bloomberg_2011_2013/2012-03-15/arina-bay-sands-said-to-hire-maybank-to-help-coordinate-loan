Las Vegas Sands Corp.’s (LVS)  Singapore
unit, Marina Bay Sands Pte, added  Malayan Banking Bhd. (MAY)  as the
fourth global coordinator for a S$4.6 billion ($3.6 billion)
loan to refinance debt, according to a person familiar with the
matter.  Maybank joins DBS Bank Ltd., Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp.
and  United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB) , the person said, asking not to be
identified because the details are private.  Singapore has authorized just two casinos, which  Las Vegas 
Sands and Malaysia’s Genting Bhd. opened in the first half of
2010. The U.S. casino company controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson  declared its first dividend earlier this year as it
reported a 17 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit on growth in
Singapore and  China .  Las Vegas Sands’ vice president of corporate finance,
Stephen Cootey, didn’t return a call made outside normal
business hours in Las Vegas seeking comment. A call to the Kuala
Lumpur office of Maybank head of corporate affairs, Eliza
Mohamed, wasn’t answered after normal business hours.  Las Vegas Sands is offering to pay a margin of 185 basis
points more than the Singapore dollar swap offered rate, however
the facility’s final fees have yet to be determined, the person
said today.  The loan may be split into a S$4.1 billion term facility
and a S$500 million revolving credit facility, another person
familiar with the matter said last week.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
