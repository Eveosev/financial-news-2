Pfizer (PFE)  Inc. Chief Executive Officer
 Ian Read  received a 44 percent raise in total compensation last
year to $25 million in his new role as head of the world’s
largest drugmaker, according to a regulatory filing.  Read, 58, was paid $1.7 million in base salary, a $3.5
million cash bonus, stock and option awards, pension and other
benefits. The cash bonus was $900,000 more than his target for
the year, New York-based Pfizer said in the filing. Read’s total
compensation was $17.4 million in 2010.  Pfizer topped its financial goals for 2011 and Read’s raise
“adjusted his salary grade to reflect the change in his
position to CEO,” the company said in its filing.  Read is shrinking Pfizer as he shifts the company into a
new phase after its top-selling cholesterol pill Lipitor began
facing generic competition last December. He also is planning to
divest the animal health and nutritionals units and trimming
overlaps from a decade of mega-mergers. The CEO said Pfizer will
focus its research on five clinical areas, ending work on
respiratory, allergy and gene-therapy treatments.  Pfizer’s board said company shareholders were upset by the
$24.7 million final-year pay of former CEO Jeffrey Kindler, who
left the company in December 2010 and was replaced by Read. The
2011 shareholder vote on executive pay passed with 56 percent
compared with 96.8 percent the year before, the drugmaker’s
board members said in their report about executive compensation
included in the filing.  “The vote outcome was highly disappointing to Pfizer, its
board of directors and its compensation committee,” the board
said.  In response, the  board  said it had made compensation more
performance-based for top executives. Read would be paid $22.4
million for “termination without cause,” or $32.6 million in
case of a change in ownership of the company, according to the
filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
