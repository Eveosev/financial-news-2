The planned NEL European natural-
gas link that will hook into the Nord Stream pipeline carrying
Russian fuel, may be delayed by a year,  RBC Daily  reported
today, citing Hans-Georg Egelkamp, the head of the project.  The link in  Germany , designed to take gas from the OAO
Gazprom-led Nord Stream pipeline when it reaches full capacity
of 55 billion cubic meters a year, has to be rerouted after
local opposition, making the new route longer and more
expensive, the Russian newspaper reported. It may be completed
in 2013, the paper said.  NEL, which will complement the existing onshore OPAL
pipeline, will have to reserve 35 percent of capacity to
suppliers other than Gazprom, RBC Daily said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
