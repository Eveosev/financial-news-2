Bahrain issued a new code of
conduct for police officers force requiring adherence to 10
principles, including limited use of force and zero tolerance
toward torture and mistreatment, the Information Affairs Agency
said today.  The  Interior Ministry  code, recommended by an independent
international commission that investigated possible human-rights
abuses during the February-March 2011 protests, states that
officers must show respect for human dignity and make arrests in
accordance with international standards. It forbids the use of
force “except when absolutely necessary,” state-run IAA said.  “This code of conduct represents a new social treaty
between members of Bahraini society and the police which will
mark the start of a new era and a correct path to building
bridges of confidence between the united Bahraini society and
the police, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid said in the
statement.  A new Internal Affairs Department being established within
the Interior Ministry will be responsible for disciplinary
reviews, as well as overseeing the new code, according to the
statement.  Last year’s mass protests, led by Bahrain’s Shiite
majority, included demands for democracy and equal rights from
the Sunni monarchy, leading to a crackdown by security forces in
which troops from neighboring  Saudi Arabia , also ruled by
Sunnis, were called in to help.  At least 35 people were killed during the rallies and an
ensuing crackdown through April last year, the independent
commission has said. Tensions in the island nation have simmered
in Shiite areas throughout the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
