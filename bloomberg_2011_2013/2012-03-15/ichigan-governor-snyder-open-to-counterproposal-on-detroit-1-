Governor Rick Snyder said he is
willing to hear a counterproposal that would avert a state
takeover of  Detroit (9845MF) ,  Michigan ’s largest city.  Snyder, a Republican, on March 13 announced plans for a
nine-member advisory board that would help devise ways to erase
a municipal deficit approaching $270 million. Democratic Mayor
Dave Bing and some City Council members rejected that move,
saying it disenfranchised citizens. They will draw up their own
plan, Bing’s office said in a statement today.  Snyder told reporters in Lansing today that any agreement
should include an advisory board in charge of city finances.  “I’m open-minded to feedback on how it works,” he said.
“It could be a very helpful role. It doesn’t have to be an
adversarial role.”  Under Snyder’s original plan, the state would delay a
declaration of financial emergency and the advisory board would
assume control of  Detroit ’s finances, including the power to
appoint the city’s chief operating and chief financial officers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
