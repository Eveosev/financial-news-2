Spanish Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria said it would be a “radical mistake” to assume
consumers will shoulder the full costs of eliminating the power
system’s financial deficit.  While  Spain  will increase electricity prices in April, it
will also cut the regulated fees that suppliers earn to comply
with a Supreme Court ruling this month, Soria said today in
Madrid. On March 8 the court ordered Soria to raise power
tariffs to help cover the cost of supply after utilities
challenged his decision to freeze prices for the first quarter.  “If someone thinks that complying with the ruling will
mean placing all of the burden on the backs of the consumers,
they are making a radical mistake,” Soria said at a televised
press conference. “The repercussions won’t just be on prices,
but on the costs” borne by utilities, he said.  Spanish consumers were allowed to run up debts of 23
billion euros ($30 billion) as successive administrations agreed
that utilities should book more revenue than they were permitted
to collect. The gap widened during the past five years, swollen
by subsidies added to customer bills to support renewable-power
plants, energy-efficiency projects and domestic coal mines.  Last week the energy regulator recommended that the
government lower regulated payments to power companies, delay
investment in new capacity and use revenue from the sale of
carbon-emission permits to cover some of the cost of renewable-
energy subsidies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
