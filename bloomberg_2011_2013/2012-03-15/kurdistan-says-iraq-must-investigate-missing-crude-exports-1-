Kurdistan  said Iraq must
investigate a difference of about 35,000 barrels of daily crude
exports this year from the region that is failing to appear in
the national total.  The semi-autonomous province is shipping about 100,000
barrels a day from the Taq Taq, Tawke, Khormor and Khurmala
fields, or about 35,000 a day more than that estimated by the
 Iraqi (OPCRIRAQ)  federal government, Kurdistan’s Ministry of Natural
Resources said today in an e-mailed statement.  “The KRG believes that this discrepancy should be
investigated immediately in case somebody is creaming off the
difference between the oil received and the oil sold,” the
ministry said in the statement.  Kurdistan has not received any payment from the central
government, which controls the export pipeline, for its oil
sales since May, which means that the province is owed more than
$1 billion for last year, according to the statement.  “Not a single dollar has been received for exports in
2012,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
