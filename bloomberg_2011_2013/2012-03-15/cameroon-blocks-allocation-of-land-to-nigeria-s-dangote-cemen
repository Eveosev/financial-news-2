Land in  Cameroon ’s port city of
Douala allocated to  Nigeria ’s  Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM)  to build a
manufacturing plant belongs to the municipality and a cultural
group and can’t be given out, a government official said.  Members of the ethnic Douala and Sawa groups resolved to
not hand over the land for any reason, Government Delegate to
the Douala City Council Fritz Ntone Ntone said in a statement
handed to reporters yesterday in Yaounde, the capital. The
2,000-square-meter (21,528-square-feet) area of land near the
shore of the Wouri River has been leased to Dangote Cement for
30 years.  Cameroon’s government signed an agreement with Dangote last
year authorizing the company to build a 55 billion-CFA-franc
($109 million) cement plant in Douala with the capacity to
produce 1 million metric tons of the building material annually.  Cameroonian Prime Minister Philemon Yang “assured the
 Dangote Group  that the government of Cameroon is keen on getting
the group to stay in the country,” Anthony Chiejina, a spokesman
for Dangote, said in a phone interview today from Lagos,
Nigeria’s commercial capital. “It is a big opportunity they
cannot afford to miss.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
