Ukrainian grain exports from ports
rose 15 percent from a month earlier in Marchâ€™s first 11 days,
UkrAgroConsult said.  Shipments increased to 617,900 metric tons from 535,200
tons, the Kiev-based agricultural researcher said today in an e-
mailed statement, citing market operators.  Corn accounted for 433,100 tons of deliveries and was
shipped to Israel, Spain and  Egypt , UkrAgroConsult said. Wheat
exports reached 90,500 tons and went to the same nations, while
barley shipments of 91,700 tons went to  Saudi Arabia .  Another 1.38 million tons of grains, including 355,000 tons
of wheat, 100,000 tons of barley and 925,000 tons of corn,
probably will be shipped from ports soon, UkrAgroConsult said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
