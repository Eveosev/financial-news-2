Sweden’s unemployment rate
unexpectedly declined in February, while employment growth was
sluggish as the largest Nordic economy struggles with waning
export demand.  The non-seasonally adjusted unemployment fell to 7.8
percent in February from 8.0 percent in January, the Stockholm-
based statistics office said today. The rate was predicted to be
unchanged at 8 percent, according to the median estimate of 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Employment was up by 0.7 percent on the month, but is
still 0.3 percent below the December reading and 0.2 percent
below the average for the fourth quarter,” said Torbjoern Isaksson, chief analyst at Nordea Bank AB, in a note to clients.
“The stronger-than-expected February reading does not alter the
picture that employment has turned down. Employment is also
below the Riksbank’s forecast.”  The Riksbank last month cut its key rate for a second time
in as many meetings in an effort to avert a recession. Sweden’s
economy, which relies on  exports  for about half its output, will
slow to 0.7 percent this year from 4.5 percent in 2011, the
central bank said on Feb. 16.  “The situation on the labor market is deteriorating faster
than the Riksbank had expected,” Isaksson said. “We stick to
our view of the Riksbank cutting rates again in April.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
