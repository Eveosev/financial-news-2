Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) , an
Israeli adaptor maker, expects more takeovers in the sector as
the acquisition of  RadVision Ltd. (RVSN)  helps boost the volume of
technology and Internet deals to the highest since 2007.  RadVision, a Tel Aviv-based maker of video-conferencing
systems, will be acquired for about $230 million by U.S.
communications-equipment manufacturer  Avaya Inc. (3414924Q) , according to a
statement yesterday. It was among the 358 M&A deals involving
technology and Internet companies in 2012, equal to $17.8
billion, compared with 377 valued at $11.1 billion in the same
period last year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “We do expect to see more consolidation in multiple
markets,” Mellanox Chief Executive Officer Eyal Waldman said in
a phone interview yesterday from  London . “There’s a constant
flow of companies that want us to look at them. We may do an
acquisition if we think it will accelerate our growth.”  Mellanox bought  Voltaire Ltd. (VOLT) , a developer of server and
storage software, for $208 million in February 2011, and Waldman
said last month the company would consider another purchase
should it bolster growth. The $17.8 billion of technology
company M&A announced in 2012 includes  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the
largest maker of equipment for computer networks, buying U.K.-
based  NDS Group Ltd. (NNDS)  in a deal valued at about $5 billion and
also announced yesterday.  Shares of Mellanox listed on the Nasdaq Composite Index
jumped 2.1 percent to $38.73 yesterday, three cents shy of a
record high. Barclays Plc raised the Yokneam Elit, Israel-based
company’s price target to $45 from $42, and said its share of
the market will grow. The  Bloomberg Israel-US 25 Index (ISRA25BN)  of the
largest Israeli companies in  New York  rose 0.9 percent to 87.66,
a five-week high.  ‘Very, Very Good’  Mellanox -- whose products are used at data centers,
investment banks and stock exchanges to transfer and store data
-- ended 2011 with $238 million in cash and investments after
completing a secondary stock offering in September that
generated around $100 million. As the size of Mellanox’s
potential customer market grows, the company may make an
acquisition to better compete with competitors  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and
 Broadcom Corp. (BRCM) , said  Joseph Wolf , an equity analyst at Barclays
Plc in  Tel Aviv .  “Clearly, they’re looking at acquisitions that will
provide them with incremental sales and earnings,” Wolf said
yesterday in an interview. As for being a takeover target,
Mellanox has become “very, very good at making a very specific
product, so you could see a large semiconductor company saying
they’d like to have them in-house,” Wolf said.  “Yet I don’t see that as imminent,” he said.  ‘Stay Independent’  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) , the world’s second-largest software company,
owns a 9.6 percent stake in Mellanox.  M&A deal volume for the Internet and technology sectors
reached $25.2 billion  in the same period of 2007, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Mellanox trades at 26.78 times the average of analysts’
earnings estimates, and reached a record-high 26.805 on Feb. 24.
That compares to the 16.3 average for companies on the  Nasdaq
Composite (CCMP) , 11.4 times for Intel and 13.4 times for Broadcom,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Wolf estimates that
Mellanox’s sales will grow 30 percent in 2012 and its shares
will trade at 29 times earnings estimates.  “We think that as long as we can grow faster than anyone
that can buy us, we think it will be better for our shareholders
if we stay independent,” CEO Waldman said.  Elbit Downgraded  RadVision shares jumped 4.5 percent to an 11-month high of
$11.70 in New York, bringing the advance this week to 53
percent.  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
Switzerland’s, has about 60 companies traded on the Nasdaq Stock
Market, the most of any country outside the U.S. after  China .
The nation is also home to more startup companies per capita
than the U.S.  Elbit Systems Ltd. (ESLT) , an Israeli defense contractor, added
2.4 percent to $38.12 in New York as Clal Finance Brokerage Ltd.
raised their rating on the stock to outperform, meaning they
expect it to do better than the market return. Clal previously
rated Elbit market-perform, an expectation returns will be in
line with those of the market. The price estimate was cut to $44
from $49.  Elbit, which reported its first  net loss  since 2007 on
March 14, may generate revenue growth of as much as 15 percent
in part by boosting sales in emerging markets, Chief Executive
Officer Joseph Ackerman said on March 14.  Syneron Medical Ltd. (ELOS) , an Israeli company that develops
aesthetic medical devices, gained the most in a month, rising
3.8 percent to $11.39.  Israel’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  fell yesterday for the first time in
three days, losing 0.2 percent to 1,109.63.  To contact the reporter on this story:
