Slovakiaâ€™s 2012  budget deficit  may
fall under 4.4 percent of gross domestic product, below the
target of 4.6 percent of GDP, as the economy will expand faster
than projected, Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said.  The  Finance Ministry  revised its forecast for the 2012
growth to 2.3 percent from 1.7 percent, on which the budget was
based, Miklos told journalists today in Bratislava, Slovakia.  To meet the 2013 goal of trimming the budget deficit below
3 percent of GDP, the government will need to adopt austerity
measures worth 1.17 billion euros, Miklos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
