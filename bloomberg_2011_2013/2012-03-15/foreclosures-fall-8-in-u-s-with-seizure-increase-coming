Foreclosure filings in the U.S.
fell 8 percent in February, the smallest year-over-year decrease
since October 2010, as lenders began working through a backlog
of seized properties,  RealtyTrac Inc.  said.  A total of 206,900 homes received notices of default,
auction or repossession last month, down 2 percent from January,
the Irvine, California-based data firm said today in a report.
One in every 637 households got a filing.  U.S. banks slowed  foreclosures  for more than a year as
 attorneys general  in all 50 states investigated charges of
shoddy and incomplete paperwork used to repossess homes. A $25
billion settlement with the five largest lenders, announced Feb.
9, removed some barriers to property seizures and provided a
“clear road map” for future actions, Brandon Moore,
RealtyTrac’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  “February’s numbers point to a gradually rising
foreclosure tide,” Moore said. “That should result in more
states posting annual increases in the coming months.”  Filings climbed in the 26 states where courts oversee
foreclosures, rising 2 percent from January and 24 percent from
a year earlier, RealtyTrac said. Half of the 20 largest
metropolitan areas had gains, led by Tampa and Miami in  Florida ,
a so-called judicial state.  In the 24 states where seizures can proceed without court
approval, filings declined 5 percent from January and 23 percent
from February 2011. Seattle and Phoenix, both in non-judicial
states, led large metro areas with year-over-year decreases.  Highest Rates  Riverside-San Bernardino,  California , topped all U.S. metro
areas with the highest foreclosure rate, one in 166 households,
followed by Atlanta, Phoenix, Miami and  Chicago , according to
the report.  Default filings, a lender’s first notice of serious
 delinquency , were sent to 58,886 U.S. properties last month, up
1 percent from January and down 7 percent from a year earlier.
Defaults rose more than fourfold in Hawaii and more than doubled
in  Maryland , RealtyTrac said.  Auctions were scheduled on 84,180 homes in February, down 2
percent from the previous month and 13 percent from a year
earlier. Auctions almost tripled in Kentucky and Illinois and
almost doubled in Iowa and  Pennsylvania .  Repossessions (HOMFREO) , the final stage of foreclosure, were
completed on 63,834 properties, down 4 percent from January and
1 percent from February 2011. They more than doubled in
Massachusetts and rose 95 percent in North Carolina, 90 percent
in Florida, 87 percent in South Carolina and 76 percent in
 Georgia , RealtyTrac said.  The company sells default data from more than 2,200
counties representing 90 percent of the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
