Uganda ’s economy won’t grow at the
rate forecast by the government because of a global slowdown,
drought, high oil prices and declining agricultural exports, the
 World Bank  said.  East Africa’s third-biggest economy may expand by 4 percent
to 5 percent in the 12 months through June, Rachel Sebudde, the
Washington-based lender’s country economist, told reporters
today in Kampala, the capital. The final estimate has yet to be
determined, she said.  The nation’s finance ministry in July forecast the economy
would expand by 6.6 percent, driven by growth in the agriculture
and service industries.  “Growth has remained subdued over the past three years on
account of exogenous shocks,” Sebudde said. “Even the forecast
of 5 percent in the financial year 2011-12 remains highly
uncertain.”  Uganda,  Africa ’s biggest coffee exporter, experienced the
worst drought in 60 years during the past season that led to
food shortages.  The government of must take steps to ensure fiscal
discipline, Sebudde said. The “continued use of supplementary
budgets is affecting budget credibility and started to raise
questions about the degree of fiscal control by authorities.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
