The ruble gained against the dollar
and the euro, pushing it higher against Bank Rossii’s currency
basket.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 29.3549 per
dollar by 7 p.m. in Moscow, a third day of gains and its
strongest close since March 5. The ruble added 0.3 percent to
38.38 against the euro and increased 0.3 percent versus the
central bank’s euro-dollar basket to 33.4162.  Russia’s ruble bonds due April 2016 rose, reducing the
yield seven basis points to 7.30 percent, the lowest since
August. The yield on the country’s sovereign dollar bonds
maturing in 2020 advanced one basis point to 3.946 percent, five
basis points above a record low on March 12.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of about 55 percent dollars and 45
percent euros to limit swings that erode exporters’
competitiveness.  To contact the reporter on this story:
