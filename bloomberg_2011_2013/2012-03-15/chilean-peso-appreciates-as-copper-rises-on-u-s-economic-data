Chile’s peso gained after reports
that showed signs of strength in the  U.S. economy  pushed the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index past 1,400 for the first time since
2008 and boosted prices of the country’s biggest export, copper.  The peso strengthened 0.9 percent to 482.25 per  U.S. dollar 
at the close of trading today, from 486.5 yesterday. The
Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American Currency Index  climbed  0.4
percent as of 2:41 p.m. in Santiago. Copper for May delivery
rose as much as 1.4 percent to $3.9030 a pound.  Chile is the world’s biggest copper exporter and the U.S.
is its third-largest customer for the metal used in homes and
cars. The  S&P 500  climbed 0.4 percent to 1,400.28 as reports on
manufacturing and jobless claims bolstered optimism in the U.S.
economy.  “Once the S&P broke 1,400 points there was a wave of
dollar selling,” said Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile
Corredores de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “That broke the support
level at 483 to 484 pesos per dollar.”  The Chilean central bank will probably leave its target
overnight rate unchanged today at 5 percent, according to  all  17
economists surveyed by Bloomberg, as the outlook for economic
growth improves and inflation expectations rise.  Offshore investors in the Chilean peso forwards market had
a $5.5 billion short position in the currency on March 13,
little changed from a day earlier, according to central bank
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
