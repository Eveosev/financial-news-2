Senior Assist NV, a Belgian
provider of care services, plans to invest 300 million euros
($392 million) over five years in  Turkey  to provide home health
care and set up centers for the elderly.  Senior Assist, based in Brussels, will focus on Turkey’s
biggest provinces of Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, targeting 6
million Turks over 60 years of age, with an initial investment
of 160 million euros over three years, the company said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The investment is Senior Assist’s fourth in a country
outside of  Belgium , following Chile, Uruguay and  Brazil ,
Chairman Bart Vanderschrick said in a telephone interview today.  “The market is very immature with only 20,000 beds,”
Vanderschrick said. “We can set the standard.”  The company opened its first Turkish nursing home last
month in the town of Gure, about 600 kilometers (373 miles) from
Istanbul, and will open another in Istanbul by the end of May,
he said.  The investments are made through real-estate partners and
will be used primarily to buy new land and facilities, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
