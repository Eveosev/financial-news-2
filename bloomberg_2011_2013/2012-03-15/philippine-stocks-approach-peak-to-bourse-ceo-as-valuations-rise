Philippine Stock Exchange Inc. (PSE) 
Chief Executive Officer Hans Sicat said the nation’s stock
market is close to a peak, a day after the benchmark index
climbed to the highest level since 2007 versus net assets.  The  Philippine Stock Exchange Index (SHCOMP)  has rallied 29 percent
in the past 12 months through yesterday, the best gain among
global equity gauges tracked by Bloomberg, and traded for 2.7
times net assets on March 14. The last time the Philippine
index’s  valuation  was that high, in December 2007, it sank 20
percent in three months.  “We are hoping we are not right at the peak, but we are
somewhere building up to the peak,” Sicat said in an interview
in  Singapore  yesterday, without elaborating on the indicators he
uses to determine fair value. “In the short term, it’s not too
healthy. The nice thing about having a relative  bull market  is
suddenly people take a look at the stock market and say it’s
good to participate.”  Foreign investors have  purchased  $1.5 billion of Philippine
shares during the past six months, the most since September
2007, as the central bank cut  interest rates  to bolster economic
growth and President  Benigno Aquino  lifted  government spending 
to a record. The  stock index  advanced 0.2 percent to 5,040.22 as
of 9:31 a.m. local time after closing at an all-time high of
5,050.99 on March 14.  Sicat, the former chief Philippine representative of a
Citigroup Inc. unit from 2000 to 2008, joined the exchange as
chairman in 2009. The market capitalization of Philippine
equities has almost quadrupled in the past three years.  Slower Growth  “He’s right about the valuations being high,” said Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-based  fund manager  at Schroders Plc,
which oversees about $291 billion worldwide. “The market is now
pricing a lot of the good macro picture but the changes won’t
happen overnight and will take place over time.”  Economic growth slowed to 3.7 percent last year from a
revised 7.6 percent in 2010 as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis
cut demand for exports. Gross domestic product will expand at
least 5 percent in 2012, a “conservative estimate,” driven by
infrastructure spending and expanding trade, Economic Planning
Secretary Cayetano Paderanga said on Feb. 28.  Aquino has said he wants to boost the $200 billion
economy’s growth rate to as fast as 8 percent. Bangko Sentral ng
Pilipinas cut interest rates at its two policy meetings this
year, reducing the overnight borrowing rate to 4 percent, the
lowest level in a year.  ASEAN Demand   Universal Robina Corp. (URC) , the largest Philippine snack-food
maker, climbed 87 percent in the past 12 months through
yesterday for the top gain in the benchmark stock index.  Globe
Telecom Inc. (GLO) , the nation’s second-largest cellular phone
services provider, advanced 73 percent for the second-biggest
increase.  The Philippine equity gauge may advance another 5.8 percent
in the next 12 months, according to share-price estimates from
about 350 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings may increase
23 percent during the period, the projections show.  Philippine companies “are still growing faster than the
underlying economy because we are either growing by introducing
more products within the Philippines or ASEAN,” Sicat said,
referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.  The Philippine index trades for 15.5 times estimated
 profit , the highest level since November 2010 and a 42 percent
premium versus the  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF) , according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The Southeast Asian nation’s $182.3
billion stock market is the 12th-largest in Asia and compares
with $3.75 trillion in Japan, the region’s largest.  Philippine companies may raise 197 billion pesos ($4.6
billion) to 198 billion pesos through initial and secondary
equity offerings this year, almost double the 107 billion pesos
last year, according to Sicat. The number of deals may climb to
85 this year from 55 last year, Sicat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
