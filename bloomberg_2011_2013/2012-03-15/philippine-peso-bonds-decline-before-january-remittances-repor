The Philippine peso dropped to a
seven-week low as the central bank reported the smallest gain in
remittances in 10 months. Ten-year bonds fell, pushing yields to
the highest level in more than two months.  Money  sent home  by Philippine citizens living abroad, the
nation’s second largest source of foreign-exchange, rose 5.4
percent in January from a year earlier, after a 6.2 percent gain
the previous month, according to today’s report. The peso fell
for a fifth day, the longest losing streak since September,
after data this week showed U.S. retail sales rose the most in
five months, boosting demand for the dollar.  “The weakness in January remittances may be seasonal,”
said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore .
“That, coupled with good data coming out of the U.S., is giving
support to the dollar.”  The peso lost 0.3 percent to 43.000 per dollar as of 4:24
p.m. in Manila, according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It touched
43.160 earlier, its weakest level since Jan. 24.  The yield on the 7.375 percent bonds due March 2021 climbed
eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 5.28 percent,
according to ICAP Plc.  “If we see a sustained weakness in remittances, that might
put some pressure on growth and the peso,” said  Jonathan Ravelas , a market strategist at BDO Unibank Inc. in Manila.  To contact the reporter on this story:
