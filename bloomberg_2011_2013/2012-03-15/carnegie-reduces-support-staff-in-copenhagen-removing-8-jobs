Carnegie Investment Bank AB, which
became the only lender to be taken over by  Sweden ’s government
during the financial crisis, cut eight jobs in Copenhagen today
as part of a plan to reduce staff by 100 people.  “In 2011, during the fall, we said we planned to reduce
the number of full-time employees by about 100 during the coming
year,” said Andreas Koch, a spokesman at Carnegie in Stockholm,
in a telephone interview today. “This is a gradual process,
but, yes, eight from various support functions have left the
Copenhagen office.”  Carnegie said in a statement yesterday that Chief Executive
Officer Frans Lindelow will leave the bank in the second half of
2012.  The plan to cut jobs, which was first announced in
November, is part of the integration of HQ Bank, which Carnegie
bought for 268 million kronor ($39.4 million) in September 2010
when HQ was stripped of its banking license.  To contact the reporters on this story:
