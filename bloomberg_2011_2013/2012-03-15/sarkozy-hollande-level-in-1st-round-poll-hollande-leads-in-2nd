French President  Nicolas Sarkozy 
and Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande  would receive the
same share of votes in the first round of France’s presidential
election with Hollande winning the run-off by a narrower margin
than in previous surveys, a poll said.  The CSA survey for BFM TV, RMC Radio and 20 Minutes
newspaper showed Hollande and Sarkozy each taking 28 percent in
the first round on April 22, ahead of anti-immigrant campaigner
Marine Le Pen at 16 percent, centrist Francois Bayrou with 13
percent, and anti-European Union, anti-free market Jean-Luc Melenchon at 11 percent. In the previous poll 10 days earlier,
Hollande led Sarkozy 30 to 28 percent in the first round.  In the May 6 run-off between the top two, Hollande would
beat Sarkozy by 54 to 46 percent, narrower than the 56 to 44
percent margin in the previous poll, and the closest margin in
the six CSA surveys so far this year. Seventy-seven percent of
respondents said they are certain of whom they will vote for in
the second round.  In a separate question, 49 percent disapproved and 48
percent approved of Sarkozy’s call to pull  France  out of
 Europe ’s open borders pact if other member states don’t better
control illegal immigration.  The poll surveyed 861 voters and no margin of error was
given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
