Two opposition groups in  Guinea  are
planning to hold protests March 17 against what they claim is a
lack of transparency in parliamentary elections, which are
planned for July 8.  “The electoral commission chose the date in a unilateral
way,” said Aboubacar Sylla, head of the Union des Forces du
Changement and spokesman for the groups, which include at least
30 political parties. “We are going to protest peacefully
because the electoral process is not transparent,” he told
reporters in Conakry, the capital, today.  Guinea, the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, is holding
parliamentary elections as part of its transition to a civilian
administration following a December 2008 military coup. Alpha Conde won a presidential election in November 2010.  Guinea’s electoral commission is ready, said Lounceny
Camara, the body’s president. “All technical, material and
financial conditions are gathered to hold a credible vote,” he
said by phone today. “If the opponents think the contrary, then
they must prove it.”  Lansana Kouyate, a former prime minister who came fourth in
the presidential vote, said his party will participate in the
protest, while they are not planing to boycott the election.  “To boycott is irresponsible,” he told reporters. “We
will make everything in order for Guinea to organize transparent
and credible elections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
