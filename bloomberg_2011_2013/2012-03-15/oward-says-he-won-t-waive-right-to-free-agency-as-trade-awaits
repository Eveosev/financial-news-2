Dwight Howard may be traded after
telling the  Orlando Magic  he won’t waive the right to end his
contract and become a free agent after this season.  Howard, who has been an All-Star the past six seasons, told
the club yesterday he won’t void an early termination option in
his deal, George Galante, a spokesman for the Magic, said in an
e-mail.  The team has said that without such a waiver, it expects to
move the three-time National Basketball Association Defensive
Player of the Year before the trade deadline at 3 p.m. New York
time today.  Howard, 26, said this season he’d like to be traded to the
New Jersey Nets. He said two days ago that he’d like to finish
this season in  Orlando . The Magic would be unlikely to allow him
to do that unless they had proof he wouldn’t depart after the
season as a free agent, leaving them nothing in return.  Howard had 22 points and 12 rebounds in the Magic’s 122-111
loss at the  San Antonio Spurs  last night.  The 6-foot-11 center, who was the top selection in the 2004
NBA draft, has career averages of 18.4 points and 13 rebounds
per game. This season, while leading the NBA in minutes played,
he’s averaging more than 21 points and 15 rebounds per contest.  With Howard at center, the Magic reached the playoffs in
each of the past five seasons. The team’s best finish was a 4-1
NBA Finals loss to the  Los Angeles Lakers  in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
