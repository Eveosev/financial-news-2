Slovak President Ivan Gasparovic
asked  Robert Fico , whose Smer party won the elections last week,
to form a new government.  Gasparovic gave Fico the mandate in Bratislava, Slovakia’s
capital, during a broadcast live on state television.  Fico’s Smer may rule without a partner after it took 83 of
parliament’s 150 seats in the March 10 vote. The party won the
elections on pledges to support poorer citizens while raising
taxes for the top earners and most profitable companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
