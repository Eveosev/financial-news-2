The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.1 percent to 701.81 at 7:24 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials fell 0.1
percent to 1,635.59.  CRUDE OIL  Oil advanced for the first time in three days in  New York ,
trimming a weekly decline as investors bet that fuel demand will
increase with an economic recovery in the U.S., the world’s
biggest crude consumer.  Crude for April delivery rose as much as 53 cents to
$105.64 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It was at $105.45 at 9:16 a.m.  London  time.
The contract yesterday dropped 32 cents to $105.11, the lowest
since March 6. Prices are down 1.8 percent this week and 6.7
percent higher this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures fell in New York following a below-
average supply drop and a forecast for warmer-than-usual weather
next week signaled reduced demand for the heating fuel.  OIL PRODUCTS  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures slid
$7.53 to $130.85 a metric ton at 5:31 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of processing profit, is set to widen for the second
week in three.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold  may decline in London, extending a weekly drop, as
signs the  U.S. economy  is gaining momentum reduce expectations
that the  Federal Reserve  will offer fresh stimulus.  Bullion headed for the biggest weekly drop in three months
after the Fed  raised its economic assessment on March 13 and
said the labor market is improving, damping expectations that it
will buy more government debt. U.S. data today may show
industrial production increased and consumer sentiment gained.  BASE METALS  GRAINS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa  fell the most in six weeks as rain helps boost crops
in West Africa, bringing the market closer to a surplus than a
shortfall. Coffee advanced.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
