Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s
largest gold mining company, fell to its lowest in more than two
months in Sydney trading, leading gold miners lower after prices
of the precious metal dropped this week.  Newcrest fell as much as 4.2 percent to A$30.00 and traded
at A$30.09 at 2:18 p.m. local time, set for its lowest close
since Dec. 30. The benchmark  S&P/ASX 200 (AS51)  (AS51) index declined 0.4
percent.  Gold for immediate delivery fell for a fourth day, taking
its decline to 4.1 percent this week, set for its biggest weekly
drop since December on expectations that the  Federal Reserve 
won’t offer fresh stimulus as the  U.S. economy  shows signs that
it is gaining momentum.  “Gold stocks are always a bit soft when gold prices are
weaker,” Warwick Grigor, an analyst at BGF Securities Pty, said
by phone from Sydney. “Everything is supportive of a higher
gold price but just at this moment people are trading other
things and leaving gold alone for the present.”  Alacer Gold Corp (AQG) . fell 5.7 percent to A$8.22, set to close
at its lowest level since July.  OceanaGold Corp. (OGC)  lost 5.4
percent to A$2.30, poised for its biggest decline since
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
