Ros Agro Plc (AGRO) , a Russian
agricultural producer listed in  London , raised February meat and
fodder output, while extending sugar production.  Meat production climbed 10 percent to 5,130 metric tons
from a year earlier, Ros Agro, also known as Rusagro, said today
in an e-mailed statement. Fodder for sale rose 19 percent to
4,300 tons.  The company extended sugar output for an additional month,
producing 3,600 tons in February, according to the statement.
Ros Agro said its sugar plants were idle in February last year
after the processing season for sugar beets ended in December
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
