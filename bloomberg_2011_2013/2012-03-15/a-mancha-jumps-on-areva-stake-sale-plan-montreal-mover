La Mancha Resources Inc. (LMA) , a
Montreal-based gold exploration company, jumped the most in 17
months after saying  France ’s Areva SA plans to auction its
majority stake.  The shares  climbed  19 percent to C$3.90 at 11:10 a.m. in
Toronto. It earlier advanced as much as 23 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Sept. 20, 2010.  La Mancha formed a special committee to carry out an
auction, it said in a statement after the close of regular
trading yesterday. The committee hired BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. as
its financial adviser and Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP as legal
counsel, La Mancha said.  Areva’s Cie. Francaise de Mines et Metaux unit owned 63
percent of La Mancha as of April 8, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg. The stake has a current market value of about
C$351 million ($353 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
