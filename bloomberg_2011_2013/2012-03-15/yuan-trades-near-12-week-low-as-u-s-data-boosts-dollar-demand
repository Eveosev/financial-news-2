The yuan was little changed after
reaching a 12-week low yesterday on speculation investors will
favor the dollar on signs the  U.S. economy  is improving.  The People’s Bank of China set its daily fixing 0.05
percent lower at 6.3359 against the greenback. The currency has
dropped 0.3 percent since official data on March 9 showed
inflation slowed to a 20-month low. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in
Beijing yesterday the yuan may be near equilibrium and policy
makers will allow greater movement in the exchange rate.  “Lower inflation in China plus a stronger dollar points to
a fixing which is higher,” in favor of the U.S. currency, said
Nick Verdi, a Singapore-based currency strategist at  Barclays
Capital . “The dollar has been stronger in recent days as
markets have reacted to the prospect of further monetary easing
in the U.S. being priced out.”  The yuan traded at 6.3300 per dollar at the close in
 Shanghai , compared with 6.3323 yesterday, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. It touched 6.3471 yesterday, the
lowest level since Dec. 21. The currency is allowed to move 0.5
percent either side of the fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan was steady at
6.3320. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.12 percent
to 6.3344, a 0.07 percent discount to the onshore spot rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Dollar Index  traded on ICE Futures in New York, which
tracks the currency against those of six major trading partners,
touched a two-month high.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said it expects
“moderate economic growth” and predicted the U.S. unemployment
rate “will decline gradually.” The Labor Department may say
today the number of initial applications by Americans for
jobless benefits fell by 5,000 to 357,000 in the week ended
March 10, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of
 exchange-rate  swings used to price options, climbed to 2.500
percent, the highest level in two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
