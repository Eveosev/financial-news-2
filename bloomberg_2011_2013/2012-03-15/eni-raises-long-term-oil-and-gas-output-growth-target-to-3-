Eni SpA (ENI) , Italy’s largest oil
producer, increased its long-term growth target for oil and gas
production as it steps up investment.  The company sees output gaining more than 3 percent a year
through 2015, it said in a presentation to investors posted on
its website today. New projects may allow for growth of 3
percent through 2021, it said.  Output is returning in  Libya , where Eni is the largest
producer, after the conflict that ousted Muammar Qaddafi shut
down most oil and gas fields in the country and caused Eni’s
output to drop 13 percent last year. Eni also discovered about
30 trillion cubic feet of gas in waters off  Mozambique  last
year.  New projects will add about 700,000 barrels of oil
equivalent a day to output, the company said. Spending on
exploration and production will rise to 44.8 billion euros
($58.6 billion) through 2015.  To contact the reporters on this story:
