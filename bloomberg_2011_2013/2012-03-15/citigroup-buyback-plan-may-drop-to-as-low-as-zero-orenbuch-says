Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-biggest
U.S. bank, may have to drop plans to return capital to
shareholders after failing one part of the  Federal Reserve ’s
stress test, Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Moshe Orenbuch said.  Citigroup could instead reduce the size of the capital
plan, which may include dividends and share buybacks, Orenbuch
said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television. He had
previously predicted the lender would return about $2 billion,
including about $1.5 billion of share buybacks and $500 million
of dividends, he said in an e-mail.  Capital at the New York-based bank would fall short of the
Fed’s minimum requirement if Pandit enacted his plan during a
severe economic slump, according to the central bank’s data. The
Fed objected to the proposal after projected loan losses were
the second-worst of 19 banks tested, the data show.  “It’s going to be smaller or zero as they resubmit,” said
Orenbuch, who has an “outperform” rating on Citigroup shares.
“The key question is can they work with the Fed to get them to
understand the actual loss characteristics of those assets.”  Pandit will submit a new plan that will return “meaningful
capital” to shareholders, he said this week after the Fed
released the results. The Fed should make public the models it
used in the tests, Pandit said.  Shannon Bell , a spokeswoman for Citigroup, declined to
comment on Orenbuch’s remarks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
