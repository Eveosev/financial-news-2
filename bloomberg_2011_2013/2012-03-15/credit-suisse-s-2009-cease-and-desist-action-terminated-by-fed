The  Federal Reserve  ended a cease-
and-desist enforcement action against  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) 
from December 2009, according to a statement today from the
central bank.  The Fed that month had issued a consent order naming Credit
Suisse AG as the Zurich-based company settled U.S. claims that
it helped process payments that let  Iran  and other nations avoid
government sanctions and gain access to U.S. financial markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
