Fairborne Energy Ltd. (FEL) , the Calgary-
based oil and natural-gas developer with projects in three
Canadian provinces, rose the most in five months after saying
it’s considering a sale or merger.  Fairborne  increased  12 percent to C$2.60 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest climb since Oct. 11. The company has a
market value of C$266.7 million ($268.8 million).  The company’s board is evaluating “strategic
alternatives” that include a sale, merger or recapitalization,
according to a statement today. A special committee of the board
will oversee the process and retain a financial adviser, and no
schedule has been set, the company said.  Fairborne has gas and oil assets in Alberta, Saskatchewan
and Manitoba as well as about C$550 million in tax pools, the
company said today. The oil producer is also developing projects
to capture and store carbon dioxide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
