Bank of Communications Co. ,  China ’s
fifth-largest lender, plans to raise 56.6 billion yuan ($8.9
billion) in the world’s biggest share sale since May.  China’s Ministry of Finance and  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , the
Shanghai-based bank’s two  largest shareholders , will take part
in the private placement, according to a filing to the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange yesterday. The lender’s board approved selling
new Shanghai- and Hong Kong-listed shares.  BoCom joins local rivals including  Industrial Bank Co. (601166)  in
seeking funds after a two-year, $2.7 trillion lending spree
sapped their finances. China’s banking regulator is planning
tougher  capital requirements  for the biggest lenders to fend off
rising credit risks.  “BoCom will become the most-capitalized bank among big
lenders in China,” said Sheng Nan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
CCB International Securities Ltd., who estimated the sale will
boost its core capital adequacy ratio by about 2 percentage
points. “Participation of the government shareholder and HSBC
ensures this is a long-term investment and there will be no
additional stock supply to depress the market.”  Shares (3328)  of BoCom rose 2.8 percent to HK$6.36 as of 9:59
a.m., extending this year’s gain to 17 percent. The stock traded
at 5.96 times its estimated earnings in 2012 and 1.02 times
estimated book value for the year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Shanghai, Hong Kong  The lender will sell 6.54 billion new Shanghai-traded
shares to seven investors including the  Finance Ministry  and
China’s National Council for Social Security Fund at 4.55 yuan
apiece, and 5.56 billion new Hong Kong-traded shares for HK$5.63
each to buyers such as HSBC, BoCom said. The company will also
place 275.7 million shares in Hong Kong on a fully underwritten
basis at the same price, it said.  HSBC will pay about $1.71 billion for 2.36 billion Hong
Kong-listed shares, keeping its stake at no less than the
current 19.03 percent, the London-based lender said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday. The bank will pay for the shares
with cash from internal resources, it said.  China’s Finance Ministry will increase its stake to 26.53
percent from 26.52 percent following its purchase of shares
listed in both Shanghai and  Hong Kong , BoCom said in its
regulatory statement.  The China Banking Regulatory Commission said in August that
it will require the country’s largest, or so-called systemically
important, lenders to have a minimum  capital adequacy ratio  of
11.5 percent by the end of 2013. Smaller banks will be required
to have at least 10.5 percent under “normal conditions” by the
end of 2016, the CBRC said.  Capital Adequacy Declines  “The main purpose of the proposed placing is to increase
the capital adequacy ratio by replenishing core capital,” BoCom
said in the filing yesterday.  BoCom’s capital adequacy ratio fell to 11.89 percent as of
Sept. 30 from 12.36 percent at the beginning of 2011, according
to its third-quarter earnings report. The bank’s core capital
adequacy ratio dropped to 9.24 percent, lower than the 9.5
percent mandatory minimum under the new capital plan.  At $8.9 billion, BoCom’s share sale would be the largest
since Glencore International Plc raised $9.9 billion in an
initial public offering in May, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  BoCom may report later this month a record profit of 48.3
billion yuan for 2011, an increase of 24 percent from a year
earlier, according to the average estimate of 18 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Industrial Bank, a Chinese lender part-owned by Hang Seng
Bank Co., said earlier this month it will raise as much as 26.4
billion yuan in a private placement.  Standard & Poor’s  warned this week that China’s banks could
face a slump in 2012 as the economy slows, property prices fall
and “sizable” local government debt requires refinancing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
