Overseas  investors  bought a net
 20.7 billion rupees  ($416 million) of Indian stocks yesterday,
taking total investments in equities this year to 425.5 billion
rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 41.8 billion rupees of shares and sold
21.1 billion rupees, the Securities & Exchange Board of  India 
said on its  website  today. The net purchase was the biggest
since the $1.5 billion investment reported on Feb. 24.  Offshore funds bought a net 1.04 billion rupees of bonds,
taking their flow into debt this year to 239.6 billion rupees,
the data  show . They put 421 billion rupees in bonds in 2011.  Foreigners have invested 4.869 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.447 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.2 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Inflows surged to a record
in 2010, making the Sensex the best performer among the world’s
top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in 2008 led the biggest
annual slump of 52 percent.  Offshore funds pulled out 27.1 billion rupees from local
equities last year, compared with record flows of 1.33 trillion
rupees in 2010, as  Europe ’s debt crisis threatened the global
economy and cooled demand for emerging-market assets. That led
to a 25 percent drop in the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , the
second worst annual loss, and sent the rupee to an all-time low.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
