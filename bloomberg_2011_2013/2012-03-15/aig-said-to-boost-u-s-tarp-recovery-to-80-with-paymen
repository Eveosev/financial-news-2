American International Group Inc. (AIG) ’s
repayment of $1.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury Department pushed
the government’s portion of recouped financial-bailout money to
80 percent, said a Treasury official familiar with the matter.  AIG made the payment today with proceeds from the sale of
remaining assets in Maiden Lane II, the vehicle created in 2008
to buy mortgage-linked assets, said the person, who asked not to
be identified because there wasn’t a public announcement. That
means the government has recovered $331 billion of the
$414 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program funds that were
disbursed, the person said.  A rebounding economy and climbing stock markets are
allowing companies to unwind bailouts from 2008 and 2009
designed to prevent a collapse of the banking system and protect
jobs. AIG, once the world’s largest insurer, was rescued in 2008
in a bailout that swelled to $182.3 billion.  The Treasury sold $6 billion in  AIG shares  earlier this
month, reducing its stake in the New York-based insurer to about
70 percent. AIG purchased $3 billion of the shares. The sale was
the second for the department since it converted a preferred
stake into 92 percent of AIG common shares in January 2011. The
government cut that holding to 77 percent in a May offering.  AIG declined less than 1 percent to $28.08 today in  New
York  and has gained 21 percent this year. The government needs
to average at least $28.72 on its share sales to recoup taxpayer
funds. It sold AIG shares for $29 apiece in both offerings.  AIG announced a plan March 7 to repay $8.5 billion in
obligations to Treasury. Along with the Maiden Lane income, the
insurer will use proceeds from selling shares of Hong Kong-based
insurer AIA Group Ltd. and escrowed cash from the sale of a unit
to MetLife Inc. in 2010, AIG said in its statement. Mark Herr, a
spokesman for AIG, declined to comment.  The U.S. government also still owns a majority stake in
Ally Financial Inc., after divesting holdings in banks including
 Citigroup Inc. (C)  and cutting its investment in  General Motors Co. (GM)   To contact the reporters on this story:
