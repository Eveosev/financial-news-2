optimism that the euro area will contain its sovereign-debt

the fastest pace since June 2010, while  Philadelphia factory
output  grew the most in almost a year.  Gains in  Europe  were limited today as Fitch said Britain
risks losing its top investment grade because of its limited
ability to deal with shocks.  U.K. Debt Rating  The rating company changed the outlook on the U.K. to
“negative” from “stable,” indicating a “slightly greater”
than 50 percent chance that the AAA-rating will be reduced

levels and threats from Europe’s fiscal crisis.  H&M (HMB)  added 2.4 percent to 249.60 kronor after comparable

Executive Officer Patrick Kron said today he will not sell
shares in the current economic climate to finance “adventurous
deals.”  K+S AG (SDF) , Europe’s largest potash producer, soared 7.2
percent to 39.16 euros after the company reduced its full-year
earnings outlook less than expected. Profit will fall
“moderately” this year before recovering in 2013, K+S said.  “The guidance downgrade was less than feared,”  Wolfgang Fickus , an analyst at WestLB AG, who recommends buying the
