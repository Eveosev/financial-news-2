Tiger Woods  said he’ll be recovered
from a left Achilles injury in time to play in next month’s
 Masters Tournament .  “I’ll be ready,” Woods said today on ABC’s “Good Morning
America” show. “I took a few days off. I’ll start hitting
balls tomorrow. The stiffness is gone. Hopefully, I’ll be ready
next week.”  Woods, 36, told the Walt Disney Co. network that he plans
to play in next week’s  Arnold Palmer Invitational  in Orlando,
 Florida , his last scheduled event before the Masters, golf’s
first major tournament of the year.  Woods, a four-time winner of the Masters in Augusta,
Georgia, withdrew from the Cadillac Championship in Miami on
March 11 because of tightness in his left leg. It was later
diagnosed as a mild strain.  The 14-time major tournament winner hasn’t won a U.S. PGA
Tour event since September 2009 and last captured the Masters in
2005. The event takes place April 5-8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
