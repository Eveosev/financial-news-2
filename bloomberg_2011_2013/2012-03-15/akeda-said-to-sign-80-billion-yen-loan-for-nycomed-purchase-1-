Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502) , which
bought Swiss drugmaker Nycomed in September, plans to sign 80
billion yen ($956 million) in syndicated loans this month to
help pay for the purchase, according to five people familiar
with the matter.  The facility will include a six-year  term loan  priced at 1
basis point more than the three-month London interbank offered
rate and a four-year term loan priced the same as the benchmark,
the people said, declining to be identified because the details
are private.  Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316)  and Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc. are arranging the deal, the people
said.  Takeda, Asia’s biggest drugmaker, will use the funds to
help repay a 570 billion yen one-year bridge loan it borrowed
from the arranging banks for the Nycomed deal, the people said.
It earlier this week sold 190 billion yen of bonds, a record
domestic offering for a pharmaceutical company in the country,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg dating back to 1985.  “We are considering various options for the repayment of
the bridge loan and cannot comment on the matter until we arrive
at a decision,” Minori Koshino, a Takeda spokesman, said in a
telephone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
