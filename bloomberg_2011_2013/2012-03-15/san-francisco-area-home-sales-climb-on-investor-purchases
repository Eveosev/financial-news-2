Home sales in the  San Francisco  Bay
Area rose 14 percent last month from a year earlier as investors
bought a record share of properties,  DataQuick  said.  A total of 5,702 new and resale houses and condominiums
sold in the nine-county region, the eighth straight year-over-
year increase and a 4.1 percent gain from January, the San
Diego-based data seller said today in a statement. Foreclosures
and short sales, where the price is less than the amount owed,
made up half of all purchases. Cash buyers accounted for a
record 32 percent of deals.  Prices fell to a median $325,500, down 0.3 percent from
January and 3.6 percent from February 2011. It was the 17th
consecutive decline on an annual basis. Absentee buyers, mostly
investors, accounted for 26 percent of sales last month, a
record, said DataQuick, which began compiling real estate
information in 1988.  “Many potential buyers are still waiting for the lending
spigot to open more,”  John Walsh , DataQuick’s president, said
in the statement. “Drum-tight credit conditions continue to
undermine housing, along with negative equity and the various
uncertainties plaguing would-be buyers.”  Alameda County  led the region with a 33 percent sales gain
from a year earlier, and Marin County had the largest price
increase, climbing 7.6 percent to a median $535,500. San
Francisco rose 5.9 percent to $624,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
