Willie Walsh , chief executive
officer of British Airways parent IAG, said the U.K. government
needs to do more to encourage business investment and help the
economic recovery.  “The government is unclear whether it is pro-business or
anti-business,” Walsh said in an interview in  London  today.
“Are we making it easier for business, are we removing
regulation that is tying us up in red tape? I don’t think
business is really seeing the benefit of that.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne , who is
implementing the biggest squeeze on government spending since
World War II, is scheduled to present his budget on March 21. He
may reaffirm his commitment to his deficit-reduction plan after
 Fitch Ratings  said yesterday that Britain risks losing its top
investment grade.  Walsh, said Osborne has an “opportunity to demonstrate by
his actions, not his words, that this is a government that is
looking to business to generate some growth and is looking to
business to help get some jobs created.  ‘‘Equally, business is looking to the government to help
facilitate that,’’ he said in the interview on the sidelines of
the the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
