MPG Office Trust Inc. (MPG) , the landlord
formerly known as Maguire Properties, said it expects to give up
ownership of a 54-story tower in downtown Los Angeles after
failing to rework debt on the property.  “We no longer believe we will be able to successfully
modify the Two  California  Plaza mortgage loan and retain an
ownership interest in the asset,” MPG said in a filing today
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The tower
probably “will be placed into receivership in the near term
pursuant to a consensual agreement and we will focus on an
orderly exit from the asset,” the Los Angeles-based firm said.  MPG has been trying to rework debt and sell money-losing
buildings since buying 24 office properties and 11 development
sites in Los Angeles and Orange County from  Blackstone Group LP (BX) 
in 2007. The company paid $2.88 billion for all the real estate
in downtown Los Angeles and Orange County, California, that
Blackstone purchased in its acquisition of  Sam Zell ’s Equity
Office Properties Trust.  The loan on the 1.33 million-square-foot (123,000-square-
meter) Two California has a balance of $470 million, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The debt was transferred to
special servicer CWCapital Asset Management LLC in December
2010.  Four other MPG buildings were also in default as of the end
of last year, and the company’s “ultimate goal is to exit the
assets,” according to today’s filing. MPG changed its name in
May 2010 after sparring repeatedly with its founder, Robert F. Maguire III.  To contact the reporter on this story:
