“ Broadchurch ,” BBC America’s searing, eight-episode drama resolves itself with a harrowing scene of child murder.  That’s not a spoiler, it’s a recommendation -- at least for anyone who likes mysteries solved, however grimly.  Set in the English coastal village of Broadchurch, the mystery begins with a discovery that shatters the fictional hamlet’s surface calm: the body of an 11-year-old boy, laid just so on the beach below a rocky cliff.  David Tennant (“ Dr. Who ”) and series standout Olivia Colman star as mismatched investigators (he’s an out-of-town higher-up, she’s the beloved local cop who knows everyone, or thinks she does).  Continual revelations of small-town secrets expand both the roster of suspects and the cloud of neighborly distrust.  Among the most likely (or so it seemed to me during the early goings): the boy’s guilt-ridden father; the oddball family friend; and, top of my list, Danny’s secretive, evidence-destroying school chum, who happens to be the local cop’s son.  There’s also the town busybody, who might call to mind the snoopy Log Lady of “ Twin Peaks ” (if she and the uber-serious “Broadchurch” had loosened up a bit).  Fox has announced plans for an American remake, but the hit U.K. original will be hard to top.  “Broadchurch” airs Wednesdays beginning Aug. 7 on BBC America at 10 p.m.  New York  time. Rating: ****  Dirty Cop  “ Low Winter Sun ,” AMC’s new dirty-cop drama, makes a good case for squeezing one more difficult man into cable’s crowded anti-hero fold.  Created by Chris Mundy (“ Criminal Minds ”) and making excellent use of downtrodden  Detroit , “Sun” stars a taciturn Mark Strong (“ Zero Dark Thirty ”) as a decent cop anguished over a very indecent thing.  In the opening moments, Strong’s Det. Frank Agnew murders a corrupt cop with “Sopranos”-worthy ruthlessness.  Agnew and his fellow detective/partner-in-crime Joe Geddes (a show-stealing Lennie James, from “ The Walking Dead ”) have their reasons, and they certainly know how to cover their tracks.  But the killing has unpredictable ramifications. A relentless Internal Affairs investigator (David Costabile) shows up, and a husband-and-wife team of drug dealers (James Ransone, Sprague Grayden) prove to be wise to police corruption.  Judging by the two episodes available for review, “Sun” lacks the originality of AMC’s “ Breaking Bad ” (kicking off its final season the night of “Sun’s” debut), and Strong’s hawklike intensity might wear thin.  Still, Ransone, Grayden and, especially, the quicksilver James might be the best things to hit Detroit in a long time.  “Low Winter Sun” airs Sunday [AUG 11] on AMC at 10 p.m. New York time. Rating: ***1/2  ‘Clear History’  Even with a wig as shaggy as his new  HBO  comedy, Larry David is unmistakably, cantankerously Larry David.  A 70-minute one-off co-written by David and directed by Greg Mottola, “ Clear History ” plays like an extended episode of “ Curb Your Enthusiasm ,” but with the characteristic misanthrope handed a fresh backstory.  David plays Nathan Flomm, a one-time marketing whiz who infamously stormed off a job just before the company made billions for his partners.  Now, 10 years (and most of his hair) later, he’s in exile on Cape Cod, scraping by, hanging out and hiding his past even from his closest poker buddies.  Enter costar Jon Hamm (“ Mad Men ”), playing the ex-business partner now leading the charmed life of a handsome  Mark Zuckerberg , well-married, wealthy and building Cape Cod’s most monstrous McMansion.  Nathan’s convoluted revenge scheme is classic David -- outlandish in scope, true to his foibles.  Mostly, it serves as backbone to the semi-improvised banter with Hamm, Bill Hader, Kate Hudson, Danny McBride, J.B. Smoove and Michael Keaton, among others who know just how to push his buttons.  “Clear History” airs Saturday, Aug. 10 on HBO at 9 p.m. New York time. Rating: ***1/2  ‘White Queen’  When the 10-part historical romance “ The White Queen ” premiered earlier this summer on British TV,  England ’s critics nitpicked.  Surely the War of the Roses wasn’t such a gleaming affair, the Middle Ages not so sanitized.  Starz viewers can find their own distractions, some more fun than others, from over-emoting royals to gratuitous sex scenes revealing more flesh than ingenuity.  “The White Queen” airs Saturday, Aug. 10 on Starz at 8 p.m. New York time.
