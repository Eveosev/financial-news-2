David Tepper ’s Appaloosa Management
LP returned 17 percent in the first half of the year, according
to a letter sent to investors last week.  Tepper, who started out trading in distressed companies and
emerging-market debt, has been a stock bull this year. In
January he said on Bloomberg Television that “the key is to be
long equities this year.”  His returns this year have beaten the  Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX) 
Index, which was up 14 percent with dividends reinvested, and
event-driven funds, which returned 5.3 percent, according to
Hedge Fund Research Inc. Appaloosa, based in Short Hills, New
Jersey, has returned 28 percent a year, on average, since it
started, said the letter, signed by Tepper.  The firm celebrated its 20th anniversary last month. An
investor who put $1 million into the fund in 1993, would have
$149 million today, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
