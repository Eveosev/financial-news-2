Twelve bottles of the 2010 wine of
Chateau L’Evangile, in the Pomerol region of Bordeaux, sold for
1,820 pounds ($2,780) a case on  London ’s Liv-ex, the lowest
level since it started trading as futures in June 2011.  The transaction on Aug. 2, involving bottles packed as two
half-cases, was priced 13 percent below the previous comparable
trade in May and down from levels between 2,067 pounds and 2,306
pounds a case in June 2011, according to data on Liv-ex’s Cellar
Watch website.  The 21 percent drop in the 2010 vintage of L’Evangile from
its June 2011 peak is less than the 30 percent decline in the
Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index over the same period. While Bordeaux
wines generally have slipped in the past four months during the
sales campaign for the region’s 2012 vintage, prices are now
showing more stability, both on Liv-ex and at auction.  “The market remained tranquil, even lethargic, with
exchange turnover flat on June,” Liv-ex said in its monthly
market report last week. “With much of the trade away, and many
disinclined to take a view, the Liv-ex indices drifted lower.”  The 2010 L’Evangile is the estate’s second-most expensive
of the past 10 years, lagging only the 2009 vintage, according
to merchant data compiled by Liv-ex, and was rated 98+ on a 100-point scale by U.S. critic Robert Parker.  The estate, on the right bank of the Dordogne, traces its
history back to the mid-eighteenth century. It was acquired in
1990 by Domaines Barons de Rothschild (Lafite), which also owns
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild and neighboring Chateau Duhart-Milon
in Pauillac as well as Chateau Rieussec in Sauternes and
vineyards in southern  France ,  Chile  and Argentina.  L’Evangile’s vineyards cover 16 hectares (40 acres) in
Pomerol, close to Chateau Petrus and Chateau Cheval Blanc, and
the wine consists of between 80 percent and 90 percent Merlot
and the remainder Cabernet Franc. It also produces a second
wine, Blason de l’Evangile.  To contact the reporter on this story:
