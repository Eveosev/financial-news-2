The bankrupt city of Stockton,
California, has “significant weaknesses” in its fiscal
management practices and internal controls that have allowed
wasteful spending and abuse of public resources, state
controller John Chiang said in a report today.  “Many of Stockton’s problems can be tracked to poor
decision-making that was not only ill-informed by weak
accounting and fiscal management systems, but failed to heed
downward-trending data that should have curbed spending and
borrowing decisions,” Chiang said in a news release.  To contact the reporter on this story:
