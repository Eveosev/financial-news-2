Mozambique  reduced its full-year coal
production forecast by more than 20 percent after floods cut
output in the first quarter, the Finance Ministry said.  The southern African country expects to produce 7 million
metric tons of coal this year, compared with an earlier estimate
of 8.9 million tons, the ministry said today in a statement.  Heavy rains that killed at least 69 people in January also
curtailed mining output and delayed rail shipments. Rio Tinto
Group, which operates the Benga coal mine in the country,
declared force majeure on deliveries from the project in
February after rain damaged a rail line.  Mozambique’s revenue from coal exports totaled $81.4
million in the second quarter, a 7.4 percent decline from a year
earlier as floods continued to hamper shipments by Rio and Vale
SA, according to the central bank.  Force majeure is a legal clause that protects a company
from liability when it can’t fulfill a contract for reasons
beyond its control.  The adverse weather compounded the risk of disruption for
companies that are already contending with threats from militia
groups to disrupt rail and road routes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
