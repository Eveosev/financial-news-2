U.K. consumers will get more time to
return goods purchased online or by phone if they change their
mind, under draft legislation published today.  Business Minister Jo Swinson said the time limit will be
increased to 14 days from seven and her department may also ban
pre-ticked boxes for extras on online forms that consumers may
not want or need. Traders would be required to set out key
information consumers should be given before agreeing to
purchases, such as additional costs or cancellation rights.  “For too long the rules that apply when buying goods and
services have been murky for both consumers and businesses,”
Swinson said in an e-mailed statement. “The situation is even
worse for vulnerable consumers who are misled into buying
something they neither need nor want.”  The proposals would give consumers 90 days to cancel a
contract and receive a full refund if they have been misled or
bullied into agreeing to it. They’d get a proportion of their
money back after 90 days. Currently, it is unclear what
consumers are entitled to in this situation, the business
department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
