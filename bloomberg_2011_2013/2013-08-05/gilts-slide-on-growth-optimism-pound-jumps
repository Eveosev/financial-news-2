The pound strengthened for a second
day against the dollar after an industry report showed U.K.
 services  expanded at the fastest pace in six years in July,
adding to signs the recovery is gathering momentum.  Sterling gained for a third day versus the euro after data
last week showed U.K. manufacturing and construction both rose
more than economists forecast. U.K. government bonds declined as
demand for the safety of fixed-income securities waned. Five-year gilts dropped for a fifth day before the nation sells 4.5
billion pounds ($6.9 billion) of the securities tomorrow.  “It’s surprising the foreign-exchange market for sure, to
see how upbeat some of the data is,” said  Neil Jones , head of
European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in  London . “The
U.K. is doing better than people expected and consequently the
market is running short of the pound.”  The pound gained 0.3 percent to $1.5332 at 4:31 p.m. London
time after jumping 1.2 percent on Aug. 2, the biggest increase
since June 6. Sterling advanced 0.4 percent to 86.45 pence per
euro after appreciating to 86.31 pence, the strongest level
since July 29.  A gauge of services output rose to 60.2 from 56.9 in June,
Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said in a statement in London today. The median
prediction of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was 57.4.  Britain’s economy will grow faster than previously forecast
this year and next as consumers increase spending, the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research said Aug. 2.  Inflation Report  Bank of England  Governor  Mark Carney  will detail plans for
forward guidance on  interest rates  in the central bank’s
quarterly Inflation Report due to be released on Aug. 7.  “Near term, it looks like the numbers have been
consistent, so that could continue to support the pound,” said
 John Hardy , head of foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo Bank A/S
in London. “We have to worry about what’s coming up later this
week with the Inflation Report on Wednesday. I don’t think the
market will be terribly surprised about what it has to offer.”  The pound has appreciated 1.3 percent in the past three
months, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes,
which track 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro rose 4.3
percent and the dollar gained 3.1 percent.  The benchmark 10-year gilt yield rose five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.47 percent after climbing to 2.49
percent on Aug. 2, the highest level since July 9. The 1.75
percent security due in September 2022 dropped 0.385, or 3.85
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.135.  Five-year yields climbed six basis points to 1.38 percent,
also the  most  since July 9.  Gilt Auction  The government last sold five-year securities on June 20 at
an average yield of 1.422 percent, compared with 0.967 percent
at the previous auction on May 14 and a record-low 0.787 percent
set at a sale on Nov. 20.  “My bias remains that I would come out of that auction
with a long position in five-year gilts,” said  Sam Hill , a U.K.
rates strategist at Royal  Bank of Canada  in London, referring to
a bet the securities will rise. “In that part of the curve,
what the Bank of England delivers will be supportive. They’ll
make a commitment which underpins low rates. If we continue to
get strong data which supports a recovery, that might mean
higher yields further out the curve.”  The central bank kept its  bond-purchase target  at 375
billion pounds at its meeting on July 31-Aug. 1 and left its
benchmark interest rate at a record-low 0.5 percent.  Carney joined the Bank of England last month from the Bank
of  Canada , where he introduced forward guidance in 2009.  Gilts lost 3.1 percent this year through Aug. 2, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries dropped 2.6 percent
and German bonds declined 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
