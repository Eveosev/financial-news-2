Corn futures traded in South Africa,
the continent’s largest producer of the grain, fell to a one-week low as gains by the rand made imports cheaper.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, slid 1.6 percent to 2,326 rand ($236) a metric ton,
the lowest since July 29, by the close on the South African
Futures Exchange in Johannesburg. The yellow variety for
delivery in September dropped 1.2 percent to 2,130 rand a ton.  The rand gained for a second day, before erasing the
advance, amid signs  China ’s economy is stabilizing after slowing
for two straight quarters. The Asian nation is the biggest buyer
of South African raw materials.  “The rand strengthened significantly on Friday and even
today,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by
phone. “Our prices were mainly influenced by that.”  The South African currency climbed as high as 9.7933 to the
dollar today and last traded at 9.8494. White corn is used to
make one of the nation’s staple foods, while the yellow variety
is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December fell 1 percent to 3,345 rand
a ton after five sessions of gains, the longest advancing streak
since May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
