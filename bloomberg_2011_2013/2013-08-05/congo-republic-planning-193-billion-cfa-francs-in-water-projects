The Republic of Congo is planning 193
billion  CFA francs  ($390 million) in projects to bring safe
drinking water to more rural communities, Radio Congo reported,
citing Minister of Planning Jean-Jacques Bouya.  The “Water for All” program announced on Aug. 3 will
address water shortages in at least 2,000 of some of the most
under-served villages, Bouya said, according to Radio Congo.  Asperbras, based in Brazil, has been awarded a tender to
drill water wells, the radio station reported. While about half
of people have access to clean water in Congo’s cities, only 10
percent can tap safe water supplies in the countryside,
according to the Ministry of Energy and Hydraulics.  The oil-producing country of  4.4 million  people has a
annual gross domestic product of $14 billion, according to the
 World Bank . The economy is forecast to grow 5.8 percent next
year from 6.4 percent this year, according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
