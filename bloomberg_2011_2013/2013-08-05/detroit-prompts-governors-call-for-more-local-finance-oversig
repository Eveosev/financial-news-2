Detroit ’s record U.S. municipal
bankruptcy shows that states need to do more to oversee
localities’ finances and unfunded liabilities, Republican and
Democratic governors said.  States should demand that municipalities more accurately
account for long-term pension and health-care obligations, said
North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican who took
office in January.  “It’s a serious issue that politicians have been passing
on to their successors,” McCrory said in an interview at an
annual National Governors Association meeting over the weekend
in Milwaukee. “It’s going to catch up, and Detroit’s the wake-up call.”  A more aggressive approach by states may forestall
bankruptcies or other fiscal woes that can lead to municipal
defaults and affect a state’s bond ratings and finances,
governors of both parties said in interviews at the meeting.  Detroit, once an industrial giant built by U.S. automakers,
filed an $18 billion bankruptcy on July 18. Kevyn Orr, the
Detroit emergency manager, has estimated the city’s pension
deficit at about $3.5 billion and $5.7 billion for retiree
benefits.  As of fiscal 2009, the 61 most populous U.S. cities had a
combined $99 billion in unfunded pension liabilities while
covering only 6 percent of retiree health-care obligations,
according to a report in January by the Pew Charitable Trusts, a
Philadelphia-based research and public-policy group.  Pushing Transparency  Governors should push local governments to provide more
transparency about their unfunded pension and health-care
liabilities, said Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper, in an
interview. Getting an accurate accounting can be difficult
because it’s not always clear what assumptions are behind the
calculations, said Hickenlooper, a Democrat.  “Transparency will go a long way towards helping us
resolve many of those issues,” he said. “If there had been
more transparency in Detroit, I think this would have gotten
resolved sooner.”  Cities sometimes make poor short-term financial decisions,
and states have to monitor that, said  Rhode Island  Governor
Lincoln Chafee, a Democrat.  “The state should have some kind of oversight to prevent
those short-term decisions that are harmful down the road,” he
said.  Bailing Out  While governors said they need to exert more oversight over
localities, they said states shouldn’t bail them out.  “We have responsibility for our pensions,” said Nebraska
Governor Dave Heineman, a Republican, in an interview. “Local
governments have responsibility for theirs.”  Heineman said when state pensions have a shortfall, the
state government typically funds half and the participants cover
the rest as a partnership. He tells municipalities to follow the
same approach, he said.  “I give them encouragement to act like we are,” Heineman
said. “You cannot let your pensions get out of hand.”  States could make it more difficult for municipalities to
accumulate unaffordable obligations in the first place, said
Donald Boyd, senior fellow at the Nelson A.  Rockefeller
Institute  of Government in  Albany ,  New York .  That can be done by requiring proper disclosure of the true
costs and encouraging pension agreements in which future
benefits don’t have the same protection as benefits already
earned, he said.  Monitoring Localities  “More disclosure would make it harder to accumulate
obligations you can’t afford,” Boyd said. “Governors, should
they choose to take more responsibility for local governments,
can do monitoring, they can do technical assistance to local
governments to help them plan.”  There are 19 states with laws allowing them to intervene in
municipal finances, mostly by reacting to crises instead to
taking steps to prevent them, and states have different
traditions of dealing with troubled cities, a Pew report last
month said.  California , where Stockton and two other cities moved to
file for bankruptcy last year, has a history of not taking
action, the report said. In contrast, Rhode Island, where
 Central Falls  went bankrupt in 2011, appointed a receiver to
take over city finances. A measure in  Michigan  also allows the
governor to appoint an emergency manager for distressed cities.  Wisconsin Approach  In 2011,  Wisconsin  Governor  Scott Walker , a Republican,
limited public-employee collective bargaining rights and
required increased worker contributions for health care and
pensions. While the moves drew weeks of protests at the state
Capitol and an unsuccessful recall of Walker, he said Wisconsin
cities now have the tools they need to manage their budgets.  “If Detroit were in Wisconsin, it wouldn’t be going to
bankruptcy,” Walker said in an interview. “You’d be hard-pressed to find a Democrat mayor in this state who, if you
pulled him aside privately, would argue that we should repeal
what we did because it’s empowered them to take control of their
budgets in a way they couldn’t before.”  It’s possible for states to work with local governments to
win concessions from unions and make other needed changes
without having to “kick working people in the teeth to make
progress,” Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin, chairman of the
Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview.  Chicago ‘Hole’  Illinois  has almost $100 billion in unfunded state pension
liabilities, which prompted Democratic Governor  Pat Quinn  to
suspend state lawmakers’ pay last month until they address the
shortfall.  Quinn said having the state fix its pension system can set
an example for  Chicago , the state’s largest city and the third-largest U.S. municipality. Moody’s Investors Service lowered the
city’s credit rating last month, citing a $36 billion
retirement-fund deficit.  “The city government, over a number of years, dug a hole
on their pension liability,” Quinn said in an interview. “We
want to work with them on reform, but ultimately the mayor and
city council, they have to take the lead in curing their
problem.”  Detroit’s situation shows what can happen when city
finances are allowed to deteriorate, said Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, a Republican. He suggested that state auditors be able
to look at municipal books to calculate a true financial picture
of unfunded liabilities according to Governmental Accounting
Standards Board guidelines.  “The message is clear: you can’t let major economic
engines in your state, like cities the size of Detroit, just
continue to pile up massive debt and not look to what has to be
done to be fiscally responsible,” Branstad said in an
interview. “Governors need to have the courage to blow the
whistle and then help solve the problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
