Derek Jeter  returned to the 15-day
disabled list with a strained right calf muscle on the same day
the New York Yankees activated third baseman  Alex Rodriguez  for
his season debut.  Shortstop Jeter, the Yankees’ 39-year-old captain, has been
limited to five games this season.  Jeter missed the first 91 games of the Major League
Baseball season while recovering from a fractured left ankle. He
strained his quadriceps muscle while running the bases in his
season debut on July 11, forcing him to miss another 12 games.  Jeter has been slowed by the calf injury for the past week
and manager  Joe Girardi  said it’s better to put him on the
disabled list than to have him test it 10 days and have a
setback. Jeter, who yesterday told reporters that “the whole
season has been a nightmare,” is hitting .211 with one home run
and two runs batted in.  Rodriguez went 1-for-4 last night as the Chicago White Sox
snapped a 10-game losing streak with an 8-1 win over the Yankees
at U.S. Cellular Field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
