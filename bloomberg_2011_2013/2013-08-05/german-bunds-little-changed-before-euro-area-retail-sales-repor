Spain ’s 10-year bond yields fell to a
six-week low as a euro-area report showed a decline in  services 
output slowed last month, adding to evidence the region is
recovering and spurring demand for higher-yielding assets.  Portuguese bonds advanced for the first time in four days
after Chinese manufacturing and services indexes data showed the
world’s second-largest economy may be stabilizing. German  10-year bunds  were little changed after yields climbed to a one-month high last week. The Netherlands sold 3.3 billion euros
($4.38 billion) of bills.  France  also auctioned short-dated
securities. Belgium and French bonds fell.  “There was a confirmation that the situation is
improving,” said Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates
strategist at  ING Groep NV (INGA)  in Amsterdam. “The potential growth
can have a positive effect on Spanish bonds. We think spreads
will continue to tighten,” he said, referring to the difference
in yield compared with German bunds.  Spain’s 10-year yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 4.59 percent at 2:33 p.m. London time after
dropping to 4.54 percent, the lowest level since June 19. The
4.4 percent bond due in October 2023 fell 0.155, or 1.55 euros
per 1,000-euro face amount, to 98.505.  Similar-maturity Portuguese bond yields decreased two basis
points to 6.55 percent.  An index of activity in the services industry based on a
survey of  purchasing managers  improved to 49.8 from 48.3 in
June, London-based Markit Economics said in a report. That’s
above an initial estimate of 49.6 on July 24. A reading below 50
indicates contraction.  Economic ‘Stabilization’  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said last week
that recent indicators signal the euro region is past the worst
of the slump and data “tentatively confirm the expectation of a
stabilization in economic activity.”  Europe ’s economy stagnated
in the three months through June and will return to growth this
quarter after six straight quarters of contraction, according to
a survey of economists on July 11.  Volatility on Belgian securities was the highest in euro-area markets today followed by those of the Netherlands and
 Austria , according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Belgian  10-year yields  increased four basis points to 2.54
percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Dutch bonds climbed
three basis points to 2.07 percent. French 10-year yields rose
four basis points to 2.24 percent.  ‘Illiquidity Premium’  “France and Belgium are underperforming,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  New
York . “There’s not that much going on and liquidity conditions
have worsened in the summer, so there may be an illiquidity
premium on these bonds, where slightly higher yields are
demanded.”  China ’s  non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers’ Index
increased to 54.1 in July from 53.9, the first acceleration
since March, government data showed Aug. 3. Readings above 50
indicate expansion.  Germany ’s  10-year yield  was little changed at 1.66 percent
after rising to 1.73 percent on Aug. 2, the highest level since
July 5.  The Netherlands auctioned 2.21 billion euros of 85-day
Treasury bills at zero percent and 1.08 billion euros of 205-day
securities at an average yield of 0.02 percent.  France allotted 3.99 billion euros of three-month bills at
0.043 percent, as well as a combined 3.87 billion euros of 168-and 350-day securities.  Spanish bonds returned 6.7 percent this year through Aug.
2, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian securities
rose 3.8 percent, while German bonds lost 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
