Vitol Group failed to buy  North Sea 
Forties crude at the highest differential in seven months, while
Royal Dutch Shell offered Russian Urals blend in northwest
Europe.  Saudi Arabian Co., also known as  Saudi Aramco , boosted its
September official selling price for all its crudes to the
Mediterranean and northwest Europe, the company said in an e-mailed statement today.  North Sea  Vitol was unable to buy Forties for loading on Aug. 23 to
Aug. 28 at a premium of $1.00 a barrel to Dated Brent, 15 cents
more than its bid on Friday, a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed. The bid was
the highest since Jan. 10, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  BP Plc didn’t manage to buy Forties for Aug. 26 to Aug. 30
at 70 cents more than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  No bids or offers were made for Brent, Oseberg and Ekofisk.
Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for September settlement traded at $108.85 a barrel
on the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $108.84 in the previous session. The October
contract was at $107.94, a discount of 91 cents to September.  Oseberg loadings are planned at six cargoes of 600,000
barrel each in Sept., one less than this month, a loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed. Exports will total
3.6 million barrels or 120,000 barrels a day down from 135,484
barrels a day, according to the plan.  Statfjord shipments next month are scheduled at four
cargoes, unchanged from Aug. Six cargoes of Gullfaks crude are
planned to load in Sept., one less cargo than this month, while
Troll loadings will rise to 13 lots, up from 11 cargoes in Aug.  Production at Statoil ASA’s Visund A platform is shut as a
result of a  power failure , spokesman Morten Eek said today by
phone from Stavanger. Technicians are working to determine the
cause of the outage. Crude from the field is sent to the
Gullfaks A .  Mediterranean/Urals  Shell withdrew its offer to sell 100,000 metric tons of
Urals for loading Aug. 16 to Aug. 20 at the port of Primorsk at
a premium of 80 cents above Dated Brent, the survey showed.  PKN Orlen was said to have bought 100,000 tons of Urals for
loading Aug. 25 to Aug. 29 from Glencore Xstrata Plc, according
to three people with knowledge of the matter. The people said
the refiner paid a premium of about 45 cents to 50 cents above
Dated Brent.  Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AS is seeking to buy
85,000-135,000 tons of CPC Blend for Aug. 25 to Sept. 5
delivery, according to two people with knowledge of the matter
who asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential. The tender closes tomorrow at 2pm local time.  The Turkish refiner also issued a tender to buy 140,000
tons of Basrah Light for Sept. 10 to Sept. 20 delivery last
week. The tender closed today.  Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest crude exporter, increased
the price for all its crudes to the Mediterranean by $1.05 to
$1.30 a barrel. Prices to Northwest Europe were raised by 40
cents to 60 cents. The company increased Arab Extra Light’s
differential by the most at $1.75 above the Brent futures
weighted average, or Bwave, published by the  Intercontinental
Exchange . That’s $1.30 more than in August.  West Africa  Indian Oil Corp. last week issued its first tender to buy
crude for loading in October, according to a document obtained
by  Bloomberg News . Part I of the tender closed today at 10 p.m.
local time, and part II closes at 3 p.m. Aug. 6, with offers
valid until 5 p.m. Aug. 7.  Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd. is scheduled to close its
