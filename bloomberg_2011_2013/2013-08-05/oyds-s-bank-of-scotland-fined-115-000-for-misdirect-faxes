Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s Bank of
 Scotland  unit was fined 75,000 pounds ($115,000) by the
Information Commissioner’s Office for misusing customer details.  Documents including payslips, bank statements, account
details and mortgage applications with customers’ address and
contact details were misdirected over a three-year period, The
Wilmslow, England-based ICO said in a  statement  on its website
today. At least 21 documents were sent to a third-party
organization, while a member of the public received 10 faxes.  “The Bank of Scotland has continually failed to address
the problems raised over its insecure use of fax machines,”
Stephen Eckersley, head of enforcement at the ICO, said in the
statement. “To send a person’s financial records to the wrong
fax number once is careless. To do so continually over a three-year period, despite being aware of the problem, is
unforgivable.”  Both undisclosed parties had fax numbers one digit
different from a department within the  Bank of Scotland  that
“routinely uploaded documents onto the bank’s system,”
according to the statement. The first incident was reported in
2009.   Lloyds said in a separate statement that the “security of
our customers’ data is always our key priority” and blamed the
misdirect faxes on “human error.” Thirty-two customers were
affected and none of them “suffered any harm or detriment as a
result of this error,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
