Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  climbed to the highest level in more than a week as a
decline in Chinese inventory to the lowest in about six months
indicated robust demand for the building material.  Rebar for January delivery rose as much as 0.3 percent to
3,687  yuan  ($602) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
the highest for a most-active contract since July 26, before
trading at 3,681 yuan at 9:42 a.m. local time. The contract rose
0.2 percent last week.  Rebar inventory  tracked by Shanghai’s Steelhome Information
Technology Co. fell for a 17th week on Aug. 2, declining 0.6
percent to 6.8 million tons, to the lowest since February.  “Inventory is being drawn down at a healthy rate,” said
Zheng Ge, an analyst at Wanda Futures Co. in Beijing. “It has
fallen to below the level seen at the same time last year, which
is quite encouraging.”  The average  spot price  for rebar was little changed at
3,447 yuan a ton on Aug. 2, according to Beijing Antaike
Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at
Tianjin port gained 0.3 percent to $130.10 a dry ton on Aug. 2,
the Steel Index Ltd. data showed.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
