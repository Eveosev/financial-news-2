European stocks rose for a sixth day,
the longest winning streak this year, as services output shrank
at a slower pace than initially forecast, outweighing worse-than-estimated earnings from HSBC Holdings Plc.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc climbed 2.7 percent on a report it
will pay as much as 70 percent of profit as dividend. Thomas
Cook Group Plc, Mediaset SpA and  Drax (DRX)  Group Plc advanced more
than 2.5 percent as analysts upgraded the shares. HSBC,  Europe ’s
largest bank, sank the most in 20 months. PostNL NV, the biggest
Dutch postal operator, plunged the most in six months after
sales missed estimates.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.2 percent to 304.74 at
the close, paring an earlier gain of as much as 0.6 percent.
Three stocks increased for every two that fell. The benchmark
gauge rose every day  last week , adding 1.8 percent in the
period, as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said
 interest rates  in the  euro zone  will remain low for an extended
period. The measure has rallied 9 percent in 2013.  “We’re finally seeing economic data picking up,”  Andrea Williams , who helps oversee $76 billion as head of European
equities at Royal London Asset Management, said by phone. “The
U.S. is still delivering strong data and core Europe is OK. The
valuation of the market is still supportive.”  The Stoxx 600 is trading at 13.9 times estimated earnings,
the most expensive since December 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  DAX, FTSE  National benchmark indexes increased in 11 of the 17
western European markets open today.  France ’s CAC 40 climbed 0.1
percent, while  Germany ’s DAX slid 0.1 percent and the U.K.’s
FTSE 100 dropped 0.4 percent. The Icelandic exchange was closed
for a holiday.  The volume of shares changing hands in the index was 28
percent less than the 30-day average, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Euro-area  services output  shrank at a slower pace than
initially estimated in July, adding to evidence the economy is
gathering strength to pull out of a record-long recession. An
index of activity in the services industry based on a survey of
 purchasing managers  rose to 49.8 from 48.3 in June, London-based
Markit Economics said. That’s above an initial estimate of 49.6
on July 24. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  A measure of U.K. services growth climbed more than
forecast to the highest level in more than six years.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s  index of U.S. non-manufacturing businesses  rose to 56 in July from the prior
month’s 52.2, a report from the Tempe, Arizona-based group
showed today. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of
economists called for a gain to 53.1.  Lloyds Dividend  Lloyds jumped 2.7 percent to 75.69 pence, the highest price
since October 2010. Chief Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio
said during investor presentations that he plans to pay 60
percent to 70 percent of earnings as dividends by 2015,
according to a report by the Financial Times, which cited
unidentified people involved in the meetings.  Thomas Cook  surged 5.5 percent to 169.9 pence, the highest
since February 2011. The 172-year-old U.K. tour operator was
lifted to a buy from neutral by Citigroup Inc. analyst Josh Lipman, who cited expectations for cost savings that will help
drive earnings. He boosted his price estimate by 33 percent to
195 pence. Bank of America Corp. increased its target to 145
pence from 115 pence, while maintaining an underperform rating.  Mediaset rose 4 percent to 3.43 euros. Deutsche Bank AG
analyst Laurie Davison upgraded the broadcaster controlled by
 Silvio Berlusconi  to buy from hold, saying pullbacks in the
share price offer attractive entry points.  Drax Gains  Drax added 2.9 percent to 672.5 pence, the highest since
October 2008. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Andrew Mead
lifted his rating on the U.K. utility to conviction buy from
neutral, citing the company’s transformation from a coal-fired
power plant to a mostly biomass-fueled facility.  “New fixed-price subsidies for renewables (including
biomass) recently published by the government indicate upside
potential to profits,” Mead wrote.  Alcatel-Lucent increased 3.6 percent to 1.92 euros.
Citigroup analyst Kevin Dennean raised his price target on the
telecommunications equipment and services provider to 2 euros
from 1.45 euros, citing “strong” second-quarter results.  HSBC slid 4.4 percent to 721.7 pence, the largest drop
since November 2011. First-half net income rose 10 percent to
$10.28 billion after U.S. loan impairments fell, the London-based lender said. That was below the $10.57 billion estimate of
five  analysts surveyed  by Bloomberg.  Emerging Markets  The bank said the mainland  Chinese market  slowed
unexpectedly in the first quarter of 2013, while Latin American
growth eased in the first half on weak consumer consumption.
HSBC also said it faces a potentially “highly damaging impact”
from planned European Union restrictions on bonuses.  PostNL (PNL)  sank 11 percent to 2.48 euros, the biggest decline
since Jan. 14. The Amsterdam-based company said sales in the
second-quarter were 1.03 billion euros ($1.37 billion), falling
short of the 1.04 billion euros predicted by analysts on
average. PostNL forecast addressed mail volume in 2013 will drop
as much as 11 percent, greater than its previous forecast of no
more than 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
