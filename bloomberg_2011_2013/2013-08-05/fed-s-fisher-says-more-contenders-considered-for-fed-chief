President  Richard Fisher  said more candidates are being
considered as a possible successor to Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke , without citing the source of his information.  “Not all the names you’ve read about are all the names
being considered,” he said in response to audience questions
after a speech in Portland, Oregon.  Fisher said he respected all the contenders for the job,
adding that it was important for the chairman to have “enormous
humility” and devotion to the position. “What we do not need
is a prima donna,” he said.  President Barack Obama on Capitol Hill told his party’s
lawmakers on July 31 that candidates include former Fed Vice
Chairman Donald Kohn and the decision wasn’t a two-way race
between  Lawrence Summers , Obama’s former top economic adviser,
and Janet Yellen, the Fed’s current vice chairman.  To contact the reporters on this story:
