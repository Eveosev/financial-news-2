Seamless North America LLC and
GrubHub Inc., online meal-ordering services planning to merge,
agreed to end exclusive deals with  New York  City restaurants.  New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman today announced
a settlement with the companies that he said would resolve
concerns the merger would harm competition.  “This settlement ensures that no single online platform
will have a monopoly on access to  Manhattan  restaurants, and it
allow consumers and restaurants the freedom to do business with
the website or app of their choice,” he said in a statement.  Schneiderman said Seamless had a “uniquely strong market
position in Manhattan” and that closely held GrubHub was its
chief competitor. As part of the settlement of the probe into
the planned merger, the companies also agreed not to form
exclusive agreements with  Yelp Inc. (YELP) , a San Francisco-based
online search service for restaurants, he said.  “We entered into the assurance in order to conclude the
New York AG’s investigation,” Abby Hunt, a spokeswoman for
Chicago-based GrubHub, said in an e-mail, speaking on behalf of
both companies. “We are excited about the combined
organization’s growth potential and the added value we will be
able to provide our restaurants and diners once the transaction
closes.”  The companies announced the merger in May. They said that
they offer their service in more than 500 U.S. cities and that
their combined revenue in 2012 was more than $100 million.  Closely held Seamless is based in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
