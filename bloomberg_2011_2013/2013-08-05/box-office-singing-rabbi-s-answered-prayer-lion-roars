“Yesterday” had more momentum on
Broadway last week than “Tomorrow,” as sales fell for the
revival of “Annie” and rose slightly for a Beatles tribute.  “ Soul Doctor ,” about the life and music of Rabbi Shlomo
Carlebach, nearly doubled after a slow start in previews, to
$296,000, according to the trade association, the  Broadway
League . “ First Date ,” the musical comedy that opens this week
and has been giving away tickets to the press, dropped 3 percent
to $430,000.  “Annie” dropped 3 percent to $942,000, its lowest in two
months. Tony Award-winner Faith Prince has proved less of a draw
as Miss Hannigan than television star Jane Lynch, who left on
July 14. (Two actresses recently replaced the original Annie,
Lilla Crawford, to play the title role and sing “Tomorrow.”)  “Let It Be,” a faux Beatles concert some reviewers deemed
less than fab, rose 2 percent to $378,000. Sales for the show,
which includes a Paul McCartney impersonator singing
“Yesterday,” haven’t returned to the first week’s tally of
$399,000.  “Kinky Boots” high-kicked to another record for the Al
Hirschfeld Theatre, up 1 percent to $1.64 million. “Matilda”
was little changed, at $1.3 million.  Overall, Broadway sales dipped 4 percent from the previous
week, to $23.1 million. Top sellers were, as usual, the sellouts
“The Lion King” ($2.1 million), “Wicked” ($1.9 million) and
“The Book of Mormon” ($1.7 million).  Muse highlights include Jeffrey Burke on  books  and Mark
Beech on pop  music .  To contact the reporter on this story:
