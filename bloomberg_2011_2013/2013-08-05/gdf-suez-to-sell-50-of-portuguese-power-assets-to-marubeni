GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA said it agreed to sell a 50
percent stake in a package of thermal and renewable power
generation assets in Portgual to Japan’s  Marubeni Corp. (8002)   Terms of the sale weren’t disclosed and GDF Suez will own
half of the venture. The assets in Portugal have a total
valuation of about 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion), said two
people familiar with the transaction.  The sale will result in a total reduction of 900 million
euros in GDF Suez’s net debt, after the venture is consolidated
into the company’s account on an equity basis. The assets
represent total installed capacity of 3,300 megawatts, GDF said
in a statement today. The transaction is expected to be
completed in the third quarter.  GDF Suez, hurt by lower demand for gas-fired power in
Europe, is cutting capacity to contain costs. The utility has
closed or mothballed about 8,600 megawatts of plants in the
region since 2009 and sought expansion in Asia,  Latin America 
and the Middle East to counter the decline at home. Chief
Executive Officer Gerard Mestrallet said last week he may pursue
further shutdowns or sales.  The utility is seeking an 11 billion-euro impact on net
debt from asset sales this year and next to reduce borrowings to
about 30 billion euros by the end of 2014.  Societe Generale SA (GLE)  is advising GDF Suez on the transaction
with Marubeni, which is based in Tokyo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
