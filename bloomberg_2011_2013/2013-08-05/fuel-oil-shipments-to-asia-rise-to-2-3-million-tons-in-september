More  fuel oil  cargoes were scheduled
last week to arrive in Asia in September from western countries,
shipping data shows.  At least 12 tankers, including very six large crude
carriers, or VLCCs, are booked to arrive in the region from the
U.S.,  Europe  and the Caribbean, according to data from
shipbrokers including Poten & Partners Inc.,  Clarkson Plc (CKN)  and
ICAP Shipping International Ltd. and information from traders.
The ships are set to carry 2.3 million metric tons of fuel oil,
compared with 360,000 tons booked as of the previous week. Some
fixtures are provisional and may be changed or canceled.  August arrivals rose to 4.2 million tons from 3.9 million
tons, the data show. Fuel oilâ€™s  East-West spread , or the premium
of Asian cargoes to European prices, was $21.27 a ton on Aug. 2,
up from $7.03 a ton a week earlier, according to Bloomberg data.
It has averaged $28.11 this year.  The following is a summary of tankers reported as
contracted to carry fuel oil to  Asia . Volumes are in thousands
of tons. Arrival times are calculated based on information on
the e-ships.net website and assume a total of four days for
loading and discharging at ports. A VLCC can carry about 270,000
tons of oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
