HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
lender, said possible damages from a lawsuit filed by a U.S.
regulator over improperly sold mortgage-backed securities could
cost the bank as much as $1.6 billion.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency “alleges that the
defendants caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to
 Fannie Mae (FNMA)  and Freddie Mac,” the London-based bank said today
in its first-half earnings report. “Based upon the information
currently available, it is possible that these damages could be
as high as $1.6 billion.”  The FHFA filed a suit in September 2011 over residential
mortgage-backed securities sponsored by HSBC. The FHFA sued 17
other banks that year, seeking to recover losses on $196 billion
in mortgage-backed bonds sold to  Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac ,
which have operated under U.S. conservatorship since they were
seized amid subprime losses in 2008.  Citigroup Inc. reached a settlement with the FHFA in May on
a lawsuit over $3.5 billion in bonds the bank sold to Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac. UBS AG said last month it’s close to an
agreement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
