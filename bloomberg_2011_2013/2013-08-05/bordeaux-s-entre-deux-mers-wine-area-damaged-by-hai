Storms packing hail damaged vineyards
covering several thousand hectares in Bordeaux’s Entre-Deux-Mers
wine-growing area and the Bergerac region in southwestern
France, the  Agriculture Ministry  reported.  Some grape plots sustained damage of as much as 80 percent
from “violent” storms and “strong episodes of hail” on Aug.
2, based on a first assessment, the Paris-based ministry wrote
in an e-mailed statement today. Apple and walnut trees also
suffered damage, the statement showed.  Entre-Deux-Mers is a  region  east of the city of Bordeaux
between the Garonne and Dordogne Rivers, producing mainly
generic red, rose and white Bordeaux wines as well as
designated-origin whites.  “State services are currently proceeding with an initial
evaluation of the damages, with the goal of presenting a balance
as soon as possible,” the ministry wrote.  Almost 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres) of vineyards suffered
varying degrees of damage as hail struck an area as much as 40
kilometers (25 miles) long and 15 kilometers wide, La  France 
Agricole reported, citing estimates from the Gironde
agricultural chamber.  Bordeaux is France’s biggest producer of designated-origin
wines. The region’s output may climb to 5.72 million hectoliters
(151 million gallons) this year, equivalent to about 760 million
bottles, from 5.45 million hectoliters in 2012, the ministry
wrote in a forecast last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
