Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel
is being investigated by the  National Collegiate Athletic
Association  to determine whether the  Texas A&M  University
quarterback was paid for signing autographs on photographs and
sports memorabilia in January,  ESPN reported .  Manziel, who last year became the first freshman Heisman
winner in the 78-year history of college football’s top
individual award, agreed to sign memorabilia for at least
$10,000 while attending the national championship game in Miami,
ESPN said, citing two unidentified people who witnessed the
signing but not the exchange of money. Many of those items were
later sold online, ESPN said.  Manziel, 20, could be ruled ineligible to play college
football if the investigation determines he violated NCAA rules
by accepting money for promoting or advertising the sale of a
product or service. Texas A&M athletic departement spokesman
Jason Cook told ESPN the school wouldn’t comment on the report.  Manziel led Texas A&M to a 10-2 record in its debut season
in the  Southeastern Conference , passing for 3,419 yards and 24
touchdowns while rushing for 1,181 yards and 19 scores.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
