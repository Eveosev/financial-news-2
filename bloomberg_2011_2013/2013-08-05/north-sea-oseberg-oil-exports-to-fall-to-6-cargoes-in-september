Shipments of North Sea Oseberg for
September are planned at six cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, a
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  shows.  Exports for next month will total 3.6 million barrels, or
120,000 barrels a day, according to the plan. This compares with
135,484 barrels a day in August.  Oseberg is one of four North Sea grades that make up the
Dated Brent benchmark, which is used to price crude from the
 Middle East , Africa and Russia. The other blends are Forties,
Brent and Ekofisk.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
