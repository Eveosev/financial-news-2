Investors poured a record $40.3
billion into equity funds in the U.S. last month as the  Standard
& Poorâ€™s 500 Index (SPX)  approached an all-time high.  Deposits into equity products, both exchange-traded funds
and mutual funds, surpassed the previous high of $35 billion
collected in February of 2000, according to data from TrimTabs
Investment Research in Sausalito,  California .  Investors added $31.6 billion to U.S. stock ETFS and $8.7
billion to equity mutual funds last month, according to
TrimTabs. Individual investors typically own mutual funds while
institutional investors and financial advisors are big buyers of
ETFs, which can be traded throughout the day like stocks.  Stocks rallied last week, sending the S&P 500 Index above
1,700 for the first time on Aug. 1, as central banks vowed to
maintain stimulus and data showed economic growth beat
projections in the second quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
