Australian Open tennis champion
Victoria Azarenka has withdrawn from this week’s Rogers Cup in
Toronto with a lower back injury, the tournament said.  The second-ranked player from Belarus pulled out of the
event after she was beaten in the final of Carlsbad, California
6-2, 6-3 by former U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur of  Australia 
yesterday.  “I’m so disappointed that I can’t make it to Toronto as I
added it to my schedule knowing what an important event it is,”
Azarenka said in a statement emailed by the Rogers Cup.  Azarenka’s exit follows that of third-ranked Maria
Sharapova of  Russia , who withdrew from the Rogers Cup on July 28
citing a hip injury. Both Sharapova and Azarenka sustained
injuries while slipping on the grass at Wimbledon last month.  The Rogers Cup is a tune-up event for the U.S. Open, which
starts Aug. 26 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
