KfW Group of  Germany  and Stockholm-based  Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA)  will help finance a 84.6-megawatt wind farm in Sweden near the Arctic Circle.  The 84.5 million-euro ($112 million) loan for the
Skogberget project will be split equally between the two banks,
KfW said today in an e-mailed statement. The wind farm will
comprise 36 turbines made by Germany’s Enercon GmbH, it said.  The Skogberget project is part of  Svevind ’s Markbygden
venture, which will expand to 4,000 megawatts of capacity by
2021 to become the largest contiguous wind farm in Europe,
according to KfW.  To contact the reporter on this story:
