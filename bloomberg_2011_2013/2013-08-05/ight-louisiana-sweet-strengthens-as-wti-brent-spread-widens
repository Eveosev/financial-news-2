Light Louisiana Sweet oil
strengthened relative to West  Texas  Intermediate as Gulf Coast
refineries increased rates and as foreign oils gained against
the U.S. benchmark.  Refineries in the region, known as PADD 3, increased  crude
runs  by 8,000 barrels a day to 8.38 million in the week ended
July 26, a record level for that time of year, according to
government data.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Port Arthur refinery in
Texas increased its fluid catalytic cracker to planned rates
today after restarting it Aug. 1 following a July 12 shut down.  Brent, the European benchmark, settled at a $2.14-a-barrel
premium to WTI, up from $2.01 on Aug. 2. LLS and other Gulf
crudes compete with foreign oils priced against Brent for space
in U.S. Gulf Coast refineries.  LLS strengthened by 15 cents to a $5.05-a-barrel premium to
WTI at 3:24 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet gained 45 cents versus WTI to a $4.95 premium.
Mars Blend strengthened by 40 cents to a 10-cent-a-barrel
premium to WTI. Southern Green’s discount narrowed 5 cents to 55
cents a barrel. Thunder Horse’s premium grew 25 cents to $2.90.  Poseidon was the only Gulf crude that weakened against WTI,
falling 25 cents to a 5-cent-a-barrel discount.  To contact the reporter on this story:
