General Motors Co. (GM) , the largest
foreign automaker in China, said sales growth in the country
accelerated last month as deliveries of Buick vehicles expanded
at the fastest pace this year.  Total sales in July climbed 11.1 percent to 221,580 units,
after expanding 10.6 percent the preceding month, Detroit-based
GM said in a statement today. Buick deliveries jumped 26 percent
to 66,208 units on the popularity of the Excelle line and
Cadillac sales surged 83 percent to 3,688, though  Chevrolet  fell
3.4 percent to 43,343.  GM’s sales have risen 11 percent this year, keeping it on
track to reach its target of selling 3 million vehicles this
year in the world’s largest auto market. The automaker last week
appointed Tim Lee to a newly created position as chairman of
 China  operations, as it expands production capacity to five
million vehicles a year by 2015.  The company plans to introduce 17 new models this year in
China, its largest market, with the focus on sport utility
vehicles and luxury models. GM is looking at bringing in nine
new or refreshed SUVs in China over the next five years.  Deliveries of Wuling vehicles, which account for almost
half of GM’s China sales, increased 4.5 percent to 98,380 units
last month, while the low-cost Baojun brand tripled to 6,302
units last month, according to the company.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
