India ’s rupee rose the most in almost
two weeks and  government bonds  gained after U.S. jobs data eased
concern the  Federal Reserve  will begin paring stimulus soon.  Labor Department figures showed Aug. 2 that American
employers added 162,000 jobs in July, compared with the 185,000
increase projected in a Bloomberg survey. Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said June 19 the Fed may start paring its bond-buying
program this year if the economy achieves sustainable growth.
The rupee’s gains may be limited as foreign funds keep selling
Indian  debt , according to QuantArt Market Solutions Pvt.  “The U.S. unemployment rate details show evidence that the
labor market is not too strong,” said Samir Lodha, senior
partner at QuantArt Market in Mumbai. “Strong intervention”
from the  Reserve Bank  of India is needed to stabilize the rupee,
he said.  The currency advanced 0.5 percent to 60.79 per dollar as of
9:50 a.m. in Mumbai, the biggest gain since July 24, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rupee,
which plunged to a record 61.2125 on July 8, fell 3.4 percent
last week, the most since Sept. 2011. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, slipped 21 basis points, or 0.21
percentage point, today to 12.89 percent.  The yield on the 7.16 percent government bonds due May 2023
declined 12 basis points to 8.17 percent in Mumbai, according to
prices from the central bank’s trading system. The yield rose 12
basis points in the five days through Aug. 2 in its eighth
straight week of increases, the longest stretch since 2000.  Overseas Funds  Overseas investors have cut holdings of Indian debt by $9
billion since Bernanke first flagged a potential tapering of
stimulus on May 22. The outflows leave the rupee more vulnerable
to a current-account deficit that official data show widened to
an unprecedented 4.8 percent of gross domestic product in the
year ended March 31.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 0.1 percent from
Aug. 2 to 62.24 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Offshore non-deliverable contracts climbed 0.2 percent to 62.29.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
