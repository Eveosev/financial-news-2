Providence Equity Partners Inc. and
Montagu Private Equity LLP are considering bids for Cambridge
Education Group Ltd., a provider of courses for students looking
to attend universities in the U.S. and Europe, four people with
knowledge of the talks said.  Cambridge’s owner, Palamon Capital Partners Ltd., is
seeking as much 200 million pounds ($306 million) for the
company, said the people who asked not to be identified because
the talks are private. First-round bids are due by November,
they said.  Palamon bought a stake in Cambridge Education in a deal
that valued the company at about 15 million euros ($20 million)
in June 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company’s operating profit before exceptional items,
depreciation and amortization climbed to 5.3 million pounds in
2012, up from 3.9 million pounds the previous year, according to
filings at the U.K.’s Companies House. Revenue climbed 29
percent to 56.1 million pounds.  The sale is being run by DC Advisory Partners Ltd., the
people said. Cambridge may also draw interest from corporate
bidders such as Study Group Ltd. of the U.K. the people said.  Officials at Montagu, Providence and DC Advisory declined
to comment. Spokeswomen for Palamon and Study Group declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
