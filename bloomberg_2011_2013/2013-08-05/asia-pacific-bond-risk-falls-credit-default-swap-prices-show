The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region from non-payment
dropped, according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 2 basis points
to 117 basis points as of 8:52 a.m. in Hong Kong, according to
Westpac Banking Corp. The gauge is headed for its lowest close
since July 23, according to data provider CMA. Banks in Sydney
were closed today for a holiday.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 2 to 143 as of 8:47 a.m. in
 Singapore , Westpac Banking prices show. The benchmark has ranged
from 99.5 to 177.8 this year, according to CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index decreased 1 to 95 as of 9:22
a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The measure is headed
for its third straight decline and its lowest level since July
24, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
