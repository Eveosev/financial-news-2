MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, won a commitment of as much as $5 billion from  SunTrust
Banks Inc. (STI)  for commercial  mortgage loans .  The funds from Atlanta-based SunTrust will be provided over
the next three years for loans originated by MetLife, the
insurer said in a statement today. It’s the first commitment to
the company’s new asset-management unit,  John Calagna , a
spokesman for New York-based MetLife, said in an e-mail.  MetLife started the unit in October for institutional
investors as it seeks to add fee income that is less capital
intensive than some of the coverage it issues. Insurers
including Prudential Financial Inc. manage money for clients
along with funds that back obligations to policyholders.  “They’re managing other folks’ money, so it’s a less asset
intensive, fee-based revenue stream,” Ed Shields, an analyst at
Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP, said in a phone interview. “The
track record for the life insurance industry in the recent years
has been very good.”  Steven Goulart, 55, oversees New York-based MetLife’s
asset-management initiative, which is also targeting private-placement debt and real estate equity investment. The company
has said it wants to be among the top five institutional real
estate investment managers. The venture offers investors
geographic diversity and access to high quality properties, said
Robert Merck, head of MetLife Real Estate Investors.  Demand Rises  “Our focus is your top-tier markets in the U.S.,” Merck
said in a phone interview. “We cover the whole U.S. with our
regional office network.”  MetLife is in talks with potential clients including
pension funds, smaller insurers and banks to commit funds to the
real estate unit, he said.  Demand for U.S. commercial real estate has climbed as the
economy recovers and investors seek the higher yields from
owning property compared with some fixed-income securities such
as U.S. Treasuries. Through May, the Moody’s/Real Capital
Analytics national all-property index had recovered 53 percent
of its losses from the peak in December 2007 through its low in
January 2010, according to a July 10 report from Moody’s
Investors Service.  SunTrust, led by Chief Executive Officer William Rogers,
has been seeking to add to property investments as the company’s
portfolio recovers from the financial crisis. The bank,
 Georgia ’s largest lender, said last month that second-quarter
profit jumped as bad-loan provisions dropped.  ‘Seeking Opportunities’  “It gives them an opportunity to diversify the regional
concentration that they have,”  Marty Mosby , an analyst at
Guggenheim Securities LLC, said in an interview. “It puts them
in front of new customers and allows them to build a quality
customer base without having to go in and develop the
distribution channel.”  SunTrust will consider loans from all regions and typically
invest in mortgages for properties on the U.S. East Coast, the
bank said in an e-mailed statement.  MetLife originated more than $9.6 billion in commercial
mortgages last year, and held $43.1 billion of the loans as of
Dec. 31, according to the statement.  The SunTrust “partnership supports our larger strategy to
provide innovative and reliable investment vehicles to our
clients,” MetLife’s Goulart said in the statement.  SunTrust’s portfolio included $59.2 billion of commercial
loans and $42.3 billion of residential loans as of March 31,
according to a regulatory filing, which shows that the bank had
$172.4 billion in total assets.  MetLife slipped 0.5 percent to $50.53 at 4:02 p.m. in  New
York . SunTrust lost 2 cents, or less than 0.1 percent, to
$35.42.  To contact the reporter on this story:
