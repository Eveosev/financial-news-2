More than 150 years before California
had vineyards, settlers in Jamestown,  Virginia  were crushing
grapes.  And by the time Father Junipero Serra brought the Mission
grape to San Diego, Thomas Jefferson was planting Monticello
with European vinifera.  For the next century Virginia wineries struggled and then
were killed off by Prohibition. It was not until the 1970s when
new wineries planted chardonnay, merlot, and cabernet franc that
people took notice of the state’s viticulture.  Since then, Virginia’s wineries have grown from six in 1979
to 230 today. It boasts 15 distinct wine regions, seven approved
as American Viticultural Areas, annual production of 475,000
cases and 2010 retail sales of $73 million, according to the
most recent data available.  Wine tourism has become big business, too, with 1.6 million
visitors spending $131 million annually. The state has 26 wine
trails, many on or near Civil War battlefields.  Driven largely by investors from other industries and other
states, millions of dollars have been poured into land far less
expensive than Napa or Sonoma Valley.  Not all have succeeded: in 1999 Patricia Kluge and her
husband Bill Moses invested $10 million to build a 100-acre
Charlottesville winery. A messy divorce was followed by
bankruptcy, allowing Donald Trump to scoop up the entire 1,300
acre Kluge estate last year, re-naming it Trump Winery.  Bordeaux Style  Over the past decade I’ve been impressed with the progress
of Virginia’s wines, especially its Bordeaux-style reds. A
tasting of several showed me that they have gone from promising,
one-dimensional wines to well-made, more complex varietals with
standout fruit flavors.  The most impressive was a Stinson Vineyards Meritage 2011
($35), made in the Blue Ridge Mountains, a Bordeaux blend at
just 13.4 percent alcohol, aged 14 months. It had everything I
look for in a red wine -- a balance of pronounced fruit,
softened tannins, and enough acid to give it spark.  Pollak Vineyards of Monticello, founded in 2003 by Margaret
and David Pollak, wine pioneers in  California ’s Carneros region,
produces a range of white and red wines. I tasted their cabernet
franc 2009 Reserve ($40), aged in French oak for ten months. It
had an amazing amount of bright cassis flavors and soft tannins
characteristic of a varietal that is wonderful to drink with
chicken and pork. The 2011 vintage is $22.  Velvet Texture  So, too, I was delighted with the velvety texture of
 Lovingston Winery  Josie’s Knoll 2009 Estate Reserve($25), with
85 percent merlot, 10 percent cabernet franc and 5 percent petit
verdot to buoy the body of the wine. There is complexity from
start to finish, and this is very well priced.  King Family Vineyards Meritage  2010 ($28) shows a sweeter
profile, the merlot up front, the alcohol hitting 14.5 percent,
which blunted finesse. RdV Vineyards Lost Mountain 2010 Bordeaux
blend was even hotter, dense and unappealing. And at $88 upon
release this fall, it is aiming for those who like huge red
wines with high alcohol, at 14.7 percent. The winery’s
Rendezvous 2010 ($75), even higher at 14.9 percent, was grapey,
without an acid component to tame it.  I was much happier with a $50 bottle of Sunset Hills
Vineyard Mosaic Red Wine 2010, with 14 percent alcohol. The
winery aims to make big reds that will age 15 years, but I found
the 2010 quite appealing. Sourced from three vineyards in Loudon
County, the Bordeaux blend, with only 186 cases made, may hint
at what Virginia terroir can do for a Bordeaux blend of
varietals, with a sunnier profile.  Long Pedigree  Philip Carter Winery takes pride in its tenure of the land
for three centuries. The 2010 Cleve is a 50:50 blend of petit
verdot and tannat, aged in French and American oak, and
“designed for longevity,” a decision that makes this very
cherry-fruited, big-bodied red highly tannic at this point. It
will be at least two years before this really shows any
maturity.  Petit verdot all on its own is behind Cooper Vineyards
Reserve 2010 ($30), with 13.8 percent alcohol. The grape shows
its warm fruitiness without being cloying, and the wine is very
smooth from start to finish, which makes it a good match for
lamb and Mediterranean dishes like couscous and tagines.  Jefferson, who considered wine “the only antidote to the
bane of whiskey,” must be smiling under the soil of Monticello.  (John Mariani writes about wine for Muse, the arts and
