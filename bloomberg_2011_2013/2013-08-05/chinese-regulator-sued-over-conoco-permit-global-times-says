China’s State Oceanic Administration
was sued for misconduct in allowing ConocoPhilips to resume
operations in Bohai Bay after a 2011 oil spill, the state-run
Global Times reported, citing a lawyer for the plaintiff.  The case against the State Oceanic Administration is being
brought by the  All-China Environment Federation , a government
supported civil-society organization, the newspaper reported
yesterday.  The regulator approved resumption of oil production in
February without a public hearing or feasibility studies, Xu
Hongliang, a lawyer for the federation, told the Global Times.
Beijing’s No. 1 Intermediate People’s Court will decide in seven
days whether to accept the case, the newspaper cited Xu as
saying.  Calls by Bloomberg News to the State Oceanic Administration
and  All-China Environment Federation  weren’t answered outside
normal business hours. The regulator will give a public
explanation soon, Li Mousheng, a director at the SOA’s press
office, told the newspaper.  A platform operated by ConocoPhilips in northeast China’s
Bohai Bay leaked 3,000 barrels of oil and drilling mud in June
2011. ConocoPhilips was ordered to halt production in September
2011.  China  National Offshore Oil Corp. is ConocoPhilips’
partner in the project.  The Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported the
legal action citing the Global Times etoday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
