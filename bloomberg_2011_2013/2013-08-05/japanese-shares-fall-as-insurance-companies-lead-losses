Japanese  shares  fell, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index dropping for the first time in three days, as the yen held
gains against the dollar after disappointing U.S. jobs data.
Insurers led losses among the gauge’s 33 industry groups.  Insurance companies dropped 2.9 percent after jumping 8
percent in the last two days. T&D Holdings Inc. led the sector’s
decline.  Hitachi Zosen Corp. (7004)  tumbled 5.7 percent after the
environmental-equipment maker’s loss widened.  Mitsumi Electric (6767) 
Co., which produces computer parts, slumped the most on the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average after posting a 1.7 billion yen ($17.1
million) first-quarter loss. Casio Computer Co. jumped 5 percent
after reporting a 31 percent increase in profit.  The Topix lost 1 percent to 1,184.74 at the close in  Tokyo ,
with all but two subsectors falling. The gauge added 5.7 percent
in the past two sessions, the biggest two-day advance since June
28. The Nikkei 225 fell 1.4 percent to 14,258.04. The yen traded
at 98.61 per dollar from as much as 99.95 on Aug. 2.  “Stocks rose a bit too strongly last week, so investors
are reversing those trades,” said  Ayako Sera , a Tokyo-based
market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd., which has
about 35 trillion yen in assets. “While U.S. jobs data signal
the Fed is unlikely to taper soon, the yen rose so it’s negative
for Japanese stocks as it leads to risk-off sentiment.”  Share swings are increasing as investors weigh Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe’s stimulus policies against concern  China’s
economy  is slowing and prospects the U.S. will end bond-buying.
The Topix moved more than 2.4 percent a day on average last
week, the biggest fluctuations since June.  Historical volatility 
over the last 90 days, a period that includes May and June when
the index plunged more than 18 percent, reached almost 32
percent last week, the highest since the crisis after the 2008
collapse of  Lehman Brothers , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Jobs Data  The Topix rose 39 percent this year through Aug. 2, making
 Japan  the world’s best developed equity market, amid optimism
Abe will push through reforms while the  Bank of Japan  continues
record stimulus. The equity gauge traded at 1.24 times  book
value  today, compared with 2.51 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.69 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index on August 2.  Futures on the  S&P 500  slipped 0.1 percent. The gauge rose
0.2 percent to a record on Aug. 2 as jobs data signaled the Fed
may continue its stimulus efforts. U.S. employers added 162,000
workers to payrolls in July, the least in four months and below
a median economist estimate of 185,000. The Fed has said
sustained improvement in the labor market will be a condition
for reducing its record $85 billion in monthly bond purchases.  “Investors are seeking to take profits,” said  Toshiyuki Kanayama , senior market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “The
yen is reacting to patchy U.S. data and the likelihood the Fed
won’t taper stimulus this year.”  Profits Rise  In  China , an index of non-manufacturing sectors rose for
the first time since March, a report Aug. 3 showed. HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics’ China services gauge was
unchanged at 51.3 in July from June, data showed today.  Corporate earnings season continued in Japan. Profits have
increased 91 percent at the 1,054 Topix companies that have
reported, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Of the 189
companies on the gauge that posted quarterly results for which
Bloomberg has estimates, 58 percent  beat  projections.  “Earnings aren’t bad,” said Takuya Yamada, a senior
portfolio manager who helps manage 140 billion yen for Astmax
Asset Management Inc. in Tokyo. “But expectations were so high
that they’re unlikely to have much of an impact in terms of
pushing prices up further.”  Mitsumi Electric tumbled 5.9 percent to 724 yen, its
steepest fall since June 13. The supplier to Nintendo Co. and
Apple Inc. recorded an operating loss of 2.7 billion yen and a
net loss of 1.7 billion yen.  Insurers Tumble  Hitachi Zosen dropped 5.7 percent to 149 yen, the most
since June 13 and the second-biggest loss on the  Nikkei 225 . The
maker of garbage incinerators and industrial-waste processing
facilities posted a 4.4 billion yen loss, more than six times
wider than the previous year.  T&D Holdings fell 3.5 percent to 1,312 yen, leading
 declines  on the Topix Insurance Index, the worst-performing
subsector today. All six companies in the measure fell at least
2 percent. Insurers were the top-performing group on Friday and
the third-best for the week ended Aug. 2.  Among stocks that rose,  Yachiyo Bank Ltd. (8409)  and Tokyo Tomin
Bank Ltd. surged after the Nikkei newspaper reported the two
regional lenders are in talks of a possible merger in fall 2014.
Yachiyo Bank, whose largest shareholder is Sumitomo Mitsui Trust
Holdings Inc., jumped 9.2 percent to 3,155 yen, its biggest
increase in 10 weeks. Tokyo Tomin, whose biggest stock owner is
Mizuho Financial Group Inc., climbed 6.1 percent to 1,190 yen.
The banks said no decision had been made.  Casio (6952)  gained 5 percent to 972 yen, the most in nearly two
months, after the maker of the world’s first compact all-electric calculator reported that profit increased 31 percent to
2.1 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
