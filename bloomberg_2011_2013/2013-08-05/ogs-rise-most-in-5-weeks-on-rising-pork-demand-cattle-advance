Hog futures rose the most in five
weeks on signs of improved demand for U.S. pork as supplies of
animals tighten. Cattle also advanced.  Wholesale-pork  prices  jumped 4.5 percent last week to the
highest since July 9, capping the biggest weekly rally since
June 14, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Meat
processors slaughtered 0.9 percent fewer hogs than the same week
a year earlier, and  U.S. exporters  sold 11,000 metric tons of
pork in the week through July 25, up from 8,000 a week earlier,
according to the USDA.  “Production will be low this week” and pork prices “will
keep going higher,” Dennis Smith, a senior account executive at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “Demand for pork is pretty good at this point, and
under these production levels, demand will outstrip supply.”  Hog futures for October settlement advanced 1.4 percent to
85.1 cents a pound at 10 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that price would mark the biggest gain
since June 27. The commodity declined 2.1 percent this year
through last week.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$1.247 a pound on the CME. On Aug. 2, prices touched $1.241, the
lowest for a most-active contract since July 9.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement rose 0.1
percent to $1.57125 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
