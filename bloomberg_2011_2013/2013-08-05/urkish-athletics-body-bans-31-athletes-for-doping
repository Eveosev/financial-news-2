The Turkish Athletics Federation
suspended 31 athletes from competing for two years after they
tested positive for banned substances.  They include hammer-thrower Esref Apak, a silver medalist
at the 2004 Athens Games, the federation said in a statement on
its website today.  The federation added it is also examining the files of
three more athletes: women’s 1,500-meter Olympic champion Asli
Cakir Alptekin, and two team-mates, hurdler Nevin Yanit and 400-meter runner Pinar Saka.  Apak was elevated from a bronze to a silver medal after
Belarussian hammer thrower Ivan Tsikhan was sent home during the
London Olympics last year when a retest found his doping samples
from the 2004 games to be positive, the Associated Press
reported at the time.  The Turkish suspensions come five weeks before the
International Olympic Committee votes on whether Istanbul,
Madrid or  Tokyo  will be awarded the right to host the 2020
Summer Olympics. Bids to host the 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012
Olympics in  Turkey  have all failed.  Today’s bans form part of a “concerted, and much more
aggressive, anti-doping policy in Turkey that has been in place
for over six months,” Professor Ugur Erderner, president of the
National Olympic Committee of Turkey, said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The list of suspensions “is a clear signal of how
seriously Turkey is taking the global issue of doping,”
Erderner said. “Led by the Turkish government, Turkey has zero-tolerance for doping and it is our intention to have clean,
young athletes competing on the international sporting stage in
the future.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
