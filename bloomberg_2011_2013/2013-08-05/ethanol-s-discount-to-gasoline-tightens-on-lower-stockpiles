Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
tightened on record low seasonal supplies of the biofuel.  The spread contracted 3.81 cents to 77.16 cents a gallon.
Inventories in the week ended July 26 dropped 4.7 percent to
16.5 million barrels, a three-week low. Ethanol for September
delivery is trading at a 13 percent premium to the October
contract, a phenomenon known as backwardation.  “The steep backwardation has producers selling any product
in tank as the cost of carry is so great,” said Justin Dirico,
manager of the biofuels desk at Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in New
York.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.6 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $2.179 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
The August contract, which expires today, slipped 3 cents to
$2.26.  Gasoline for September delivery decreased 4.41 cents, or
1.5 percent, to $2.9506 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S. and one bushel of the
grain makes at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.
Stockpiles of the fuel are down 15 percent from a year earlier,
data from the Energy Information Administration shows.  Production has slumped three consecutive weeks through July
26 to 832,000 barrels a day, the lowest since April 12, data
from the Energy Department’s analytical arm show.  Crush Spread  Corn for September delivery fell 6.75 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $4.6925 a bushel in Chicago. The more-actively
traded December contract declined 3.25 cents to $4.605.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts for the grain and biofuel, was 47 cents, up
from 45 cents on Aug. 2, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  A 2007 energy law mandates that refiners use 13.8 billion
gallons of ethanol in gasoline this year and 14.4 billion in
2014.  Compliance with the law is tracked by Renewable
Identification Numbers, or RINs, which are attached to each
gallon of biofuel and that can be traded among refiners.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  was fell 3 cents to $1.03, while
 advanced RINs , which cover biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, slipped 2 cents to $1.09.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  fell 0.5 cent
to $2.43 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The additive
was unchanged at $2.28 in Chicago, $2.375 in the U.S. Gulf and
$2.465 on the West Coast.  Ethanol  imports  tumbled 68 percent to 13,000 barrels a day
in the week ended July 26, according to EIA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
