The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
said it plans to conduct another series beginning this week of
“small-value” reverse-repurchase agreements using Treasury and
mortgage-backed-securities collateral as part of its readiness
testing of operational tools.  The operations don’t represent any change in monetary
policy, the New York Fed said in a  statement  today. They will be
open to all eligible counterparties, according to the statement.  Fed officials have said they may use tools including
reverse repos to withdraw or neutralize cash in the banking
system.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, draining cash from the banking system. At maturity, the
securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash to the primary
dealers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
