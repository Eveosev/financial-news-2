Turkish benchmark bond  yields 
declined for a third day to the lowest in almost a month after
inflation data in July met expectations. The lira dropped.  Yields on two-year benchmark bonds retreated seven basis
points to 8.77 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Istanbul, the
lowest level since July 9. The lira depreciated 0.4 percent to
1.9327 per dollar.  Consumer price  gains rose to 8.9 percent, the fastest since
September and in line with the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of nine economists. The  two-year break-even  rate, which
measures the difference between inflation-protected and non-index linked bonds, fell 18 basis points to 6.01 percent.  “Demand is not very strong and expectations are
reasonable,” Ercan Erguzel, an economist at  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  in
Istanbul, wrote in e-mailed comments. “Looking at these
factors, I expect inflation to somewhat decline.”  Turkey ’s central bank revised its year-end inflation
forecast last week to 6.2 percent from 5.3 percent, citing
volatility in the lira and rising energy import costs. It
tightened monetary policy on July 23 by raising the upper end of
its so-called interest rates corridor to curb the volatility in
the lira.  The central bank has sold $7 billion in foreign exchange
auctions since June 11 to support the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
