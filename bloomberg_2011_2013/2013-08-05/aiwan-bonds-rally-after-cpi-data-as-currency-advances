Taiwan ’s bonds rallied the most in at
least seven months after local inflation slowed more than
forecast and U.S. companies created fewer jobs than economists
predicted. The island’s dollar strengthened.  Consumer prices rose 0.08 percent in July from a year
earlier, the statistics bureau reported today in Taipei,
compared with the median estimate of a 0.6 percent gain in a
Bloomberg survey. U.S. data Aug. 2 showed employers added
162,000 workers in July, short of the 185,000 increase projected
in a separate survey. The  Federal Reserve  has said it may pare
$85 billion a month in asset purchases as early as September.  “The CPI is one reason” for today’s strong rally in bonds,
said Allen Chu, a fixed-income trader at  President Securities
Corp. (2855)  in Taipei. “Another reason is that the Fed won’t taper
its stimulus any time soon. Buying momentum should continue.”  The yield on the 0.875 percent government notes due January
2018 fell seven basis points to 1.11 percent as of 9:53 a.m. in
Taipei, the biggest decline since the debt was sold in December,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The rate advanced 10
basis points last week.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.388
percent, the weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center showed.  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.6 percent to NT$29.958
against its U.S. counterpart after losing 0.6 percent last week,
Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. It reached NT$29.930, the highest
level since July 30.  One-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.1 percent to
NT$29.966, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the  exchange
rate  used to price options, dropped 31 basis points, or 0.31
percentage point, to 3.51 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
