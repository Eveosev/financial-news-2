Brazil economists cut their 2013
growth forecast to the lowest this year, as the world’s second-largest emerging market grapples with flagging  consumer
confidence  and persistent inflation.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will grow 2.24 percent this
year, compared with the previous week’s forecast of 2.28
percent, according to an Aug. 2 central bank survey of about 100
analysts published today. This was the 11th time in the past 12
weeks that economists reduced their 2013 GDP expectations.  President Dilma Rousseff’s administration is trying to
balance policies aimed at sparking growth while slowing price
increases that are near the top of the target range. While
officials last month cut 10 billion reais ($4.4 billion) from
the budget to help control spending, a weaker real has fueled
inflation, and policy makers have lifted the key rate 125 basis
points this year. The central bank has signaled it may extend
rate increases to ensure inflation doesn’t hurt demand and
investments.  Swap rates on the contract due in Janurary 2015 rose three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.75 percent at 9:03
local time. The real was little changed at 2.2888 per U.S.
dollar and has weakened 10.3 percent so far this year.  Falling food and transportation costs helped slow annual
inflation to 6.4 percent in mid-July from 6.67 percent the month
prior. Policy makers target inflation at 4.5 percent plus or
minus two percentage points.  Recent economic indicators indicate  Brazil ’s economy is
struggling to accelerate. While industrial production increased
more than economists forecast in June, output has contracted in
5 of the past 12 months. Consumer confidence  plunged  in July to
the lowest level since May 2009, according to a survey from the
Fundacao Getulio Vargas.  Latin America’s largest economy expanded by 0.9 percent
last year, down from 2.7 percent in 2011 and 7.5 percent in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
