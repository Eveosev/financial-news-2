The Netherlands started a legal
appeal against a court ruling that may lead to holders of bonds
and shares seized during the February rescue of SNS Reaal NV
being compensated.  The government filed the case at the Netherlands’ highest
court,  Geertje Janssen, a spokeswoman for the Dutch Ministry of
Finance, said in an e-mailed statement today. The ministry is
asking the court to clarify aspects of laws that the government
used to seize the assets before an investigation starts into the
value of the securities, she said.  Dutch Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem became the first
Dutch leader to use powers granted under laws introduced last
year allowing failing banks to be unwound. The Amsterdam Court
of Appeal’s Enterprise Chamber ruled in July that Dijsselbloem
was probably wrong to refuse compensation to investors whose
securities were wiped out. The court said it would appoint
investigators to define the compensation required.  “The State considers it important that the Supreme Court
gives its view on the issue of how certain parts of the law
should be explained before the investigation ordered by the
Enterprise Chambers begins,” Janssen said.  SNS Reaal was nationalized after real estate losses brought
it to the brink of collapse, costing the Netherlands 3.7 billion
euros in write-offs and capital injections. The state is also
providing another 6.1 billion euros in loans and guarantees.  To contact the reporters on this story:
