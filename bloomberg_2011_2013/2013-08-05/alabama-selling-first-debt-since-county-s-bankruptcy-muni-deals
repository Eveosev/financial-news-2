Alabama  plans to sell $173 million of
general-obligation bonds in its first issue since Jefferson
County filed for bankruptcy in 2011.  The majority of this week’s tax-free deal will help the
state of 4.8 million people refinance debt, according to
offering documents. The borrowing will also fund economic-development projects, including automotive suppliers and an
aviation training facility. Alabama has the nation’s fourth-lowest median household income.  The bonds have an Aa1 grade from Moody’s Investors Service,
second-highest. The company gives Alabama a stable outlook,
citing plans to rebuild rainy day funds after reserves were
depleted following the recession that ended in 2009.  “The credit rating of the state’s general obligations
continues to be strong,” Jennifer Ardis, press secretary for
Governor Robert Bentley, a 70-year-old Republican, said via e-mail.  Home to Birmingham, Alabama’s most-populous city, Jefferson
County filed a $4.2 billion bankruptcy in November 2011. It was
the nation’s largest municipal failure until  Detroit ’s on July
18.  Jefferson County last month filed a plan to end its
bankruptcy this year by cutting $1.2 billion in principal
payments to investors holding defaulted sewer-related debt. The
2011 filing was tied to a sewer refinancing tainted by political
corruption.  2010 Sale  Alabama last came to market in May 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. General obligations of the state that mature in
June 2020 and are callable in 2019 were valued Aug. 1 at a yield
of 2.36 percent, or 0.74 percentage point above benchmark debt,
Bloomberg Valuation data show.  Bonds from the state have lost 3.6 percent in 2013, less
than the 3.7 percent decline for the broader municipal market,
Barclays Plc data show.  The state’s median household income was $41,415 in 2011,
higher than only Arkansas, Kentucky and  Mississippi , according
to Census Bureau data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
