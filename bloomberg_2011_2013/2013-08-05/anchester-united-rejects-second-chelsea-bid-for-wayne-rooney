English Premier League soccer
champion  Manchester United  rejected a second bid from Chelsea
for England striker  Wayne Rooney .  The latest bid made yesterday was 25 million pounds ($38
million) “plus add-ons,” up from an earlier offer of 20
million pounds, the British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  The bid was “immediately rejected,” United spokesman
Philip Townsend said by phone, without confirming the financial
details. “Our position remains that he is not for sale.”  Rooney is still keen to leave Old Trafford and is
considering making a formal transfer request, the BBC added.  He won’t travel to Sweden for a pre-season match against
AIK in Stockholm tomorrow after injuring a shoulder, the club
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
