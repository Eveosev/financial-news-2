For sale: $359,900 Most people would probably not think of buying a former prison and turning it into a home. And most probably wouldn't think of opening a bed and breakfast where inmates have slept. But for those that can imagine owning a place with bars and literally cell-like bedrooms, there's a place in Indiana for you. The Parke County Jail remained in use from its construction in 1870 until 1998. From there, it sat empty until the current owners paid a visit to Rockville. "The owners were touring the jail," said listing agent Wendy Buckler of  Buckler Realty, LLC.  "All she [one of the owners] wanted was to buy the steel door. They told her that they wouldn't sell her the door but the whole jail." So, on a whim, they did buy the whole thing and began the process of turning it into a private home as well as a bed and breakfast. As far as original features go, the jail has not changed much. The sheriff's office and a few larger holding cells were turned into suites, and the remaining cells were transformed into smaller bedrooms. Although the rooms have better furniture than you'd expect to see in a prison, the bars are still intact. "The only way to take out the bars would be to destroy the foundation," explained Buckler. "The bars are buried in 18 inches of concrete." The bars can still have control panels to lock rooms, but Buckler assures "they don't ever lock people in." Upstairs, additional offices — Buckler believes they were once administrative offices — were transformed into a one-bedroom private residence that includes all the features expected in a home: dining room, living room, kitchen and laundry room.
