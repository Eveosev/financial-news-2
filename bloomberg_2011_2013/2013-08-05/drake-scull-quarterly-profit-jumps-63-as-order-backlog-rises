Drake & Scull International PJSC (DSI) , a
Dubai-based construction company, said second-quarter profit
surged 63 percent, beating analysts’ estimates, as the company
expanded in Saudi Arabia.  Net income rose to 52.2 million dirhams ($14.2 million)
from 32 million dirhams a year earlier, the company said in a
statement today without specifying whether the figure includes
minority interests. The mean estimate of five analysts was for a
profit of 50.3 million dirhams, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We are well on track in achieving our growth objectives
for the year,” Chief Executive Officer Khaldoun Tabari said in
the statement. “Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
continue to be the key drivers to our top-line growth.”  Contract revenue increased in the second-quarter to 1.34
billion dirhams compared with 717.3 million a year earlier. The
order backlog surged to 11.7 billion dirhams at the end of
second quarter from 7.4 billion a year earlier.  Drake & Scull was up 1.7 percent at 1.18 dirhams as of
10:47 a.m. in Dubai. The stock has soared 68 percent this year
compared with a 63 percent increase for the Dubai Financial
Market General Index.  “Our recent contract awards in the Jordanian market and
the ongoing projects in Southern Iraq will contribute to the
bottom line growth in the second half of the year as
productivity on project sites improves,” the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
