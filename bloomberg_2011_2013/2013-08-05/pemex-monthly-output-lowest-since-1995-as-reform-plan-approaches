Petroleos Mexicanos’ July oil
production slid to its lowest monthly level in almost 18 years
as the world’s fifth-largest crude oil producer is heading
toward a ninth straight year of declined output.  Crude production fell to 2.482 million barrels a day in
July as output at its largest Ku-Maloob-Zapp and Cantarell
fields slid from the previous month, state-owned Pemex said
today in a preliminary report. July production was the smallest
monthly output by Pemex since October 1995 when it produced
1.898 million barrels a day.  The diminished production results come on the same week
that President Enrique Pena Nieto and his  Institutional
Revolutionary Party  are expected to present a proposal to
congress that would reform the  energy industry  and allow for
private investment. The proposed bill is likely to call for the
end of the government’s monopoly on production and overhaul the
industry to allow private companies to explore and produce oil
in a bid to boost economic growth.  Pemex, the third-largest crude oil exporter to the U.S.,
has seen production plummet as output from the Cantarell field
has plunged more than 80 percent since 2004. Pemex lowered its
year-end 2013 output goal last month to an average of 2.541
million barrels a day, 0.6 percent below the company’s goal to
produce more than 2.55 million barrels this year, according to
 Carlos Morales , head of production and exploration.  Pemex reported July 26 that its second-quarter net loss
widened to 49 billion pesos ($3.87 billion) from the year-ago
period. Sales slid 3.2 percent to 393 billion pesos on lower
fuel prices and declining exports, the company said in a
regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
