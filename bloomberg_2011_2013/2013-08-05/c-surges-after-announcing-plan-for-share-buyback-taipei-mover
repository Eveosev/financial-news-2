HTC Corp. (2498) ,  Taiwan ’s biggest
smartphone maker, jumped the most in more than 20 months in
Taipei trading after announcing a share buyback.  HTC  surged  by the daily limit of 7 percent to NT$153, its
biggest gain since Nov. 14, 2011. The benchmark  Taiex index 
added 0.5 percent. The stock has slumped 49 percent this year on
sliding sales of its handsets, including the new flagship HTC
One smartphone.  HTC plans to buy back 15 million shares between NT$140 and
NT$290 apiece from Aug. 5 to Oct. 4, the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based
company said in a statement to the Taiwan stock exchange. The
buyback accounts for 1.8 percent of the company’s outstanding
shares and is worth as much as NT$4.35 billion ($145 million),
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The buyback “shows the company’s determination to
stabilize the stock price and boosts investors’ confidence,”
Yuanta Investment Consulting said in a report today.  The stock fell to its lowest in almost eight years last
week after the company said sales may drop for an eighth quarter
in the three months ending Sept. 30 amid intensifying
competition. Net income dropped 83 percent from a year earlier
in the June quarter on revenue that fell 22 percent, the company
said in a statement on July 5.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
