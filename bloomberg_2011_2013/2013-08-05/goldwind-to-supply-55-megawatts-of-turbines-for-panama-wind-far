Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. (2208) , China’s largest turbine maker by revenue, will
provide 55 megawatts of equipment for a wind farm in Panama.  A joint venture of Goldwind and Spain’s Union Eolica
Espanola SL received $71 million in loans to develop the first
phase of the Penonome wind farm, the Urumqi, China-based company
said today in a statement.  Banco Internacional de Costa Rica SA and Banco Espirito
Santo de Investimento SA led the financing.  The project in Cocle Province may eventually reach 220
megawatts, making it the largest in Central America, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
