FreightCar America Inc. (RAIL) ’s stock
jumped the most in more than a year after the manufacturer of
aluminum railroad cars used to haul coal announced 5,500 post-quarter orders, helping blunt a net loss that was wider than
analysts’ estimates.  Shares of the Chicago-based company  surged  9.3 percent to
$19.79 at the close in New York, the biggest one-day gain since
February 2012. The stock fell 12 percent this year compared with
a 25 percent gain for the Russell 2000 Index.  “The quarter was disappointing relative to where Street
expectations were, but the orders that they received post-quarter is why you’re seeing a strength in the stock today,”
Justin Long, an analyst at Stephens Inc. in Little Rock,
 Arkansas , said by phone.  The 5,500 orders booked after June 30 included about 4,000
for rebuilt coal cars, according a statement released after the
U.S. markets closed on Aug. 2. The announcement helped counter a
second-quarter net loss of $3.4 million, Long said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
