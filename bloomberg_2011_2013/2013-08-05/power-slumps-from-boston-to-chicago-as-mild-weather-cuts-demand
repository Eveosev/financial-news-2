Spot wholesale electricity from
Boston to Chicago and Washington slid as milder weather reduced
the need to run air conditioners.  The Northeast and mid-Atlantic states will see below-normal
temperatures today, according to WSI Corp. in Andover,
Massachusetts. The high in  New York City  today may reach 80
degrees Fahrenheit (27 Celsius), 4 below the day’s average peak,
and Washington may be 7 lower at 81 degrees, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Consumers are using less power on the three regional grids
versus the previous weekday. On-peak prices in New York City are
heading toward their lowest level since June 2012, while spot
power for the 13-state PJM Interconnection LLC network may drop
to a six-month low.  “Weather in key heavy population density market areas in
the North was very mild last week and the outlook through this
Friday for markets north of the 38th parallel (from around San
Fran to D.C.) is mild as well,”  Stephen Schork , president of
Schork Group Inc.,  a consulting group in Villanova,
Pennsylvania, said in a note to clients today.  Spot electricity for New York City dropped $17.16, or 37
percent, to $29.07 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 11
a.m. from the same time on Aug. 2, while Boston fell $13.96, or
35 percent, to $25.95, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Prices at PJM’s benchmark Western hub, which includes
deliveries to Washington, slid $24.45, or 44 percent, to $31.78
a megawatt-hour. The PJM grid serves more than 60 million people
from  New Jersey  to Illinois and north Carolina.  To contact the reporter on this story:
