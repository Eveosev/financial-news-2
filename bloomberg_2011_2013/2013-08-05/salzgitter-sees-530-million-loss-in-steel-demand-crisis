Salzgitter AG (SZG) , Germany’s second-largest steelmaker, expects a pretax loss of about 400 million
euros ($530 million) this year amid a slump in demand due to the
European economy.  “The ongoing recession in many European countries has put
pressure on the European  steel industry  in the form of a
structural crisis,” the Salzgitter-based company said in a
statement today. “Owing to the extreme contraction in
construction activities in southern European countries, with no
significant recovery in sight in the medium term, sectional
steel products such as beams are particularly hard-hit.”  Waning demand from the auto and construction industries in
Europe and competition from China has pushed down steel prices
and squeezed producers’ profits. Germany’s industry leader,
 ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , reported a second-quarter net loss of 656
million euros on May 15. Salzgitter cited “persistently high
losses” at beam-making unit Peiner Traeger GmbH and said it
would reduce the value of the unit’s assets by 185 million
euros.  In addition, Salzgitter said the steel division’s earnings
prospects have deteriorated and there are no “notable”
projects for large-diameter pipes. Losses from the company’s 25
percent stake in  Aurubis AG (NDA)  amounted to 60 million euros in the
second quarter.  Salzgitter said further details would be released with
half-yearly financial statements on Aug. 14.  To contact the reporters on this story:
