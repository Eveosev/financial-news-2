Volkswagen AG (VOW) , seeking to expand U.S.
sales, plans to decide in the fourth quarter whether to build a
sport-utility vehicle at its Chattanooga, Tennessee, factory,
the plant’s chief executive officer said.  The automaker, based in Wolfsburg, Germany, has already
spent about $1 billion to open the Tennessee factory in 2011 to
build the Passat sedan.  The plant, which employs 2,600 people, is among the top two
locations being considered for the SUV, Frank Fischer, head of
the plant, told reporters after a presentation at the Center for
Automotive Research’s annual Management Briefing Seminars near
Traverse City, Michigan. The other site being considered is in
 Mexico , he said.  “They’re very far into the process” of deciding, Fischer
said.  The Crossblue concept, a seven-seat SUV shown at the North
American International Auto Show in January, could help VW reach
its target of increasing sales in the U.S., where it lags
competitors, to 1 million Audi and VW vehicles by 2018. VW and
Audi reported 2012 combined U.S. sales of 577,443.  Volkswagen’s goal is to overtake  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and
 General Motors Co. (GM)  as the world’s largest automaker by sales by
2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
