Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  is reviewing the
financial viability of Nomura Code Securities Ltd., the Japanese
bank’s U.K. brokerage specializing in health and clean-technology companies, said a person with knowledge of the
matter.  Nomura Code  alerted  the  London Stock Exchange (LSE)  last month it
had ceased making a market in U.K. stocks. The parent company is
set to conclude a formal review of the unit’s operations in a
few weeks, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because the process hasn’t been made public. Sunny Tucker, a
Nomura spokesman in  London , declined to comment.  About 30 people work for Nomura Code, which is run by Chief
Executive Officer Chris Collins. Its health-care analysts, Samir Devani, Gary Waanders and Michael King, follow companies
including GW Pharmaceuticals Plc, BTG Plc and Abcam Plc. A call
to Collins for comment wasn’t immediately returned.  Code Securities Ltd. was set up in 2003 from the health-care team at WestLB Panmure. Nomura,  Japan ’s largest brokerage,
acquired the firm in 2005. Nomura Code operates independently
from the parent company’s investment bank.  In addition to research and equity sales and trading, the
firm also advises on mergers and arranges stock sales. Nomura
Code focuses on companies valued at less than 1 billion pounds
($1.53 billion). John-Marc Bunce and Ken Rumph, the firm’s
clean-tech analysts, follow companies including Oxford
Instruments Plc and Ricardo Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
