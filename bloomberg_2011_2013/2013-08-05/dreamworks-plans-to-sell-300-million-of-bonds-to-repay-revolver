DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc. (DWA)  plans
to sell $300 million of bonds as the independent film studio run
by  Jeffrey Katzenberg  seeks to repay loans under its revolving
credit facility.  With $200 million outstanding on its revolver as of June
30, according to an Aug. 1 regulatory filing, the studio that
made “Shrek” a household name may have remaining funds from
the offering of seven-year securities to finance acquisitions or
stock buybacks. The Glendale, California-based company, which
currently doesn’t have any bonds, announced the offering today
in a statement.  The new bonds may be rated Ba3 by Moody’s Investors
Service, according to a person with knowledge of the offering
who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t set.  To contact the reporter on this story:
