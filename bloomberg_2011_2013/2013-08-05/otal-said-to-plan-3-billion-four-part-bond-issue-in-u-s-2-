Total SA (FP) ,  Europe ’s third-biggest oil
producer, sold $3 billion of dollar-denominated bonds in four
parts.  The company’s $500 million of 1 percent notes due August
2016 yield 50 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, $1 billion of 2.125 percent, five-year securities
pay a relative yield of 75 basis points and $1 billion of 3.7
percent debt maturing in January 2024 pays a 110 basis-point
spread, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It also issued
$500 million of five-year floating-rate securities to yield 57
basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered
rate.  Total’s $1 billion of 2.75 percent debentures due July
2023, priced in January, traded at 93.19 cents on the dollar to
yield 3.57 percent on Aug. 1, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The new securities are expected to be rated Aa1 by Moody’s
Investors Service, Bloomberg data show. Bank of America Corp.,
Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG managed the offering
for the company, which sold the notes through its Total Capital
International and Total Capital units. Proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc are Europe’s biggest oil
