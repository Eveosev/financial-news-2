Major League Baseball informed the
 New York Yankees  that  Alex Rodriguez  will be suspended in a drug
case tomorrow and will be able to play for the team while he
appeals the penalty, the Associated Press reported.  The Yankees weren’t told the length of the ban, which may
be through the 2014 season, AP said, citing an unidentified
person familiar with the deliberations. Rodriguez, 38, could get
a ban that wouldn’t extend through the 2014 season if he were to
give up the right to file a grievance, AP reported.  Rodriguez is among 14 players to face discipline for their
connections to Biogenesis of America LLC, the now-closed Miami-area clinic accused of supplying performance-enhancing drugs.  MLB spokesman Pat Courtney declined to comment on the
report. Rodriguez has said he’ll rejoin the Yankees tomorrow in
Chicago for the opener of a three-game series against the White
Sox.  To contact the reporter on this story:
