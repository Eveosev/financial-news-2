The Honduran government deployed
military forces to the National Penitentiary over the weekend
after a riot between armed inmates in the Central American
country killed three people and left at least 10 injured.  President Porfirio Lobo sent reinforcements to the prison
in an attempt to end the “reign of delinquency” and disarm
inmates within the penitentiary following an Aug. 2 riot.
Security in the prison, located west of the capital,
Tegucigalpa, is “unacceptable” and military assistance will be
provided until a solution to the country’s failing penitentiary
system is found, according to a statement from the presidential
palace.  The riot began when inmates of rival gangs began shooting
at one another within their cells, Jose Augusto Avila, president
of the Honduran Prison Inspection Committee, told newspaper La
Prensa. Prisoners were found in possession of AK-47 assault
rifles and grenades, La Prensa said.  The fighting occurred hours after the Inter-American
Commission on  Human Rights  released a  report  that said Honduran
prisons were overcrowded and detailed how prisoners often act as
administrators in national penitentiaries. A Feb. 14, 2012,
prison fire in  Honduras , which was ruled to be accidental,
killed 362 inmates.  Government Response  “The state has de facto ceded basic aspects of prison
administration to the prisoners themselves,” the report said.
“Most of the penal centers and national penitentiaries in the
country are run under systems of ‘self-government’ or ‘shared
government’ where certain inmates called ‘coordinators’ are
those who exercise internal control.”  As a result, inmates are often responsible for applying
discipline, setting prices and collecting illegal payments for
living space in cells and distributing and setting the prices of
food, the report said.  The government will install a layered, maximum security
system at the prison to improve the control of goods that enter
or leave the facility, according to a statement today from the
Honduran presidential offices.  Members of the military will continue to monitor inmate and
visitor activities at state prisons in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro
Sula for at least the next 90 days, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
