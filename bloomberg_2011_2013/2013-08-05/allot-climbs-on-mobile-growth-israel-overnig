Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT)  surged to a
six-month high in New York on prospects the Israeli maker of
technology used to track wireless traffic will benefit from a
rebound in mobile provider spending in the second half of 2013.  The shares gained 7.3 percent to $15.55, swelling the
premium versus the stock in Tel Aviv to 1.3 percent. The

Securities Inc. and Maxim Group LLC raised their  price targets 
on shares of Hod Hasharon, Israel-based Allot by as much as 13
percent yesterday. The company will probably report today that
second-quarter sales fell 1.3 percent, according to the average
estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “There’s some rising optimism around service providers
spending again,”  Brent Bracelin , an analyst at Pacific Crest
Securities LLC, who rates Allot the equivalent of buy, said by

expect a second half rebound in their business.”  T-Mobile, the fourth-largest carrier, increased monthly
contract customers last quarter for the first time in three
