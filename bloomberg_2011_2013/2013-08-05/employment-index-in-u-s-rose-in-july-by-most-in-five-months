A measure of job prospects in the
U.S. climbed in July by the most in five months, a sign the
labor market is improving.  The Conference Board’s Employment Trends Index increased
0.4 percent, the biggest gain since February, the New York-based
private research group said today. At 112.2, the gauge reached
the highest level since June 2008 and was up 4.1 percent from a
year earlier.  “With economic activity remaining weak through the second
quarter, solid employment growth continues to be a positive
surprise,”  Gad Levanon , director of macroeconomic research at
the Conference Board, said in a statement. “Jobs may grow
faster in the coming quarters as the U.S. economy is likely to
get stronger towards the end of 2014.”  The economy expanded at a 1.7 percent annualized rate in
the second quarter after a 1.1 percent gain in the prior three
months, held back by the effects of federal tax increases and
government spending cuts.  Today’s report follows Labor Department data last week that
showed payrolls rose by 162,000 in July following a 188,000 gain
in June. The  unemployment  rate fell to 7.4 percent last month
from 7.6 percent.  The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market
indicators to forecast short-term hiring trends. Improvements in
seven of the index’s eight components contributed to the rise in
the overall gauge, the Conference Board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
