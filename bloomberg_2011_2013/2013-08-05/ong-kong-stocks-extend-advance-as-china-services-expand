Hong Kong   stocks  rose, extending the
benchmark index’s longest weekly winning streak since October,
after China’s services data released on the weekend accelerated
the first time since March in a sign the economy is stabilizing.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.3 percent to 22,249.34 as of
9:32 a.m. in Hong Kong after completing a six-week advance.
About two shares rose for each that fell. The Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index climbed 0.2 percent to 9,748.20.  The Hang Seng Index fell 2.1 percent this year through Aug.
2, the worst performance among developed markets tracked by
Bloomberg, amid concern China’s growth is slowing and
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will begin to taper stimulus.
The gauge  traded  at 10.59 times estimated earnings last week,
compared with 15.5 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  A measure of China’s non-manufacturing sectors rose to 54.1
in July from 53.9 in June, a report Aug. 3 showed ahead of a
mainland services gauge due today from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics. Official manufacturing data released last week
showed unexpected expansion. The People’s Bank of China will
fine-tune policies to balance stable growth, economic reforms
and risk prevention, according to a statement released
yesterday.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, also known as the H-share index, has fallen as much as 27 percent from a Feb. 1 high
this year, meeting some investors’ definition of a  bear market .
The  measure  traded at 1.18 times the value of net assets on Aug.
2, 33 percent lower than its five-year average of 1.77.  Futures on the  S&P 500  fell 0.1 percent today. The equity
gauge rose 0.2 percent in  New York  on Aug. 2. A report showed
U.S. employers added 162,000 workers to payrolls in July, the
least in four months and below a median economist estimate of
185,000. The Fed has said sustained improvement in the labor
market will be a condition for reducing its record $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases.  Materials and energy companies led declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index through Aug. 2 on concern demand
will weaken as  China’s economy  slows. Information-technology and
utility shares were the biggest gainers.  Hang Seng Index  futures rose 0.2 percent to 22,201. The HSI
Volatility Index added 2.7 percent to 16.55, indicating traders
expect a swing of 4.7 percent for the equity benchmark in the
next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
