Copper fell for the first time in
four sessions in  New York  as output from the services industry
shrank in  Europe  and U.S. investors increased bearish wagers on
the metal.  An index of activity in euro-area services was at 49.8 for
July, London-based Markit Economics said today. A reading below
50 indicates contraction. Money managers more than  doubled  their
net-short position, or bets on lower copper prices, to 26,924
Comex futures and options contracts as of July 30 from the prior
week, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission  data  show. The
dollar rose for the second time in three sessions against the
euro.  “We’ve seen some signs of a decent demand scenario in the
U.S. and  China , but we’re still not getting the same news out of
Europe,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath Trading in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview. “The CFTC data is helping hold
copper back, along with the stronger dollar.”  Copper futures for delivery in September slid 0.1 percent
to settle at $3.168 a pound at 1:11 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The metal advanced 2.2 percent last week as reports showed
that Chinese and U.S. manufacturing strengthened.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 0.4 percent to $6,975 a metric ton ($3.16 a pound).  Aluminum and nickel were lower in London. Lead, tin and
zinc rose.  To contact the reporter on this story:
