German stocks  were little changed, as
declines in utilities and banks offset gains in  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and  Deutsche Boerse  AG.  RWE AG (RWE) ,  Germany ’s second-largest utility, slipped 2.4
percent after  RBC Capital Markets  cut its recommendation on the
stock. Lufthansa followed its European peers higher, recovering
some of its Aug. 2 selloff.  Xing AG (O1BC) , the business social
network, jumped the most since October as  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) 
upgraded its rating on the shares.  The benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  fell 0.1 percent to 8,398.38 at the
close of trading in  Frankfurt , after earlier losing as much as
0.5 percent. The equity benchmark rose 2 percent last week,
extending its 2013 advance to 10 percent as the  Federal Reserve 
kept its monthly bond purchases unchanged. The broader HDAX
Index dropped less than 0.1 percent today.  “After a strong performance during the last weeks we are
seeing a consolidation in the market with extremely low
volumes,” Soeren Steinert, who helps manage about $24 billion
as associate director for equities trading at Quoniam Asset
Management GmbH in Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mail.  RWE slipped 2.4 percent to 22 euros. RBC Capital Markets
cut its rating on the stock to underperform, the equivalent of
sell, from sector perform, and reduced its 12-month share-price
estimate to 20 euros, citing the delayed impact of lower power
prices on the company’s profit in 2014 and 2015. EON AG, the
country’s largest utility, lost 1.1 percent to 12.60 euros.  Banks Retreat  Deutsche Bank, Germany’s biggest lender, slipped 0.8
percent to 34.24 euros, and  Commerzbank AG (CBK) , the second-largest,
retreated 1.6 percent to 6.66 euros. A gauge of European banking
stocks fell the most of the 19 industry groups the Stoxx  Europe 
600 Index.  Lufthansa added 1.2 percent to 14.84 euros as a measure of
European travel and leisure stocks was among the best performers
on the Stoxx 600. Europe’s second-largest airline last week said
restructuring efforts are starting to pay off as an efficiency
push helps improve earnings.  Xing rose 8.9 percent to 56.17 euros as Deutsche Bank
upgraded the shares to buy from hold. Opportunities for growth
have not been fully appreciated by the market, according to the
bank, which cited Xing’s product portfolio and attractive market
opportunities. The shares have a 30 percent upside potential,
Deutsche Bank said.  Deutsche Boerse, operator of Frankfurt’s stock exchange,
added 3.4 percent to 55.87 euros.  ProSieben Upgraded  ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG, the broadcaster controlled by KKR
& Co. and Permira Advisers LLP, advanced 0.9 percent to 33.47
euros as Liberum Capital upgraded the shares to buy, reversing a
downgrade that it made on July 22. The brokerage said the
company’s second-quarter results and commentary gave it more
confidence about conditions in the German advertising market.  Solarworld AG (SWV)  jumped 26 percent to 64 euro cents as
creditors approved proposals to try to save Germany’s biggest
solar-panel maker. A total of 99.96 percent of noteholders
present in a meeting in Bonn today representing 35.78 percent of
Solarworld’s 150 million-euros ($198.8 million) of bonds due
July 2016 backed the restructuring plan, the company said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
