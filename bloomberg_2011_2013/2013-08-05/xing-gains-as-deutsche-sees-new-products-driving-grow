Xing AG (O1BC)  rose the most in nine months
after analysts at Deutsche Bank AG said that growth
opportunities at the German provider of online networking
platforms seem “highly under-appreciated.”  Xing  gained  as much as 9.5 percent, the steepest intraday
gain since Oct. 26, 2012. The shares traded 9.4 percent higher
at 56.45 euros as of 11 a.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the company
at 313 million euros ($416 million). Trading volume was almost
twice the three-month daily average.  Xing has invested in new products over the past year,
including an employer branding profile and the XING Talent
Manager which enables corporate users to search a pool of
canditates.  “We believe that XING’s revamped product portfolio, mainly
the XTM and Employer Branding Profile, is poised for strong
growth,” Frankfurt-based analysts Benjamin Kohnke and Uwe Schupp, wrote in a note dated Aug. 2, uprading the Hamburg-based
company to buy from hold with a price estimate of 73 euros.  The new products will add 7 million euros of incremental
revenue in 2014, “while the online recruiting business will
continue to be the main driver of XING’s business in the short
to mid-term.”  Xing should report “a very solid set of results which show
a nice pick-up in revenue growth” of 13.6 percent when it
releases second-quarter earnings tomorrow, the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
