SMU SA’s dollar bonds rallied,
pushing yields to the lowest in two weeks, after the Chilean
retailer said it plans to sell more assets than previously
planned to repay debt.  The yields on SMU’s dollar bonds due in 2020 fell 57 basis
points, or 0.57 percentage point, to 13.68 percent at 4:03 p.m.
in New York, the lowest since July 18, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The price increased 1.97 cent to 75 cents on the
dollar.  SMU, controlled by the Chilean billionaire Alvaro Saieh,
plans to sell retailers Construmart SA, Distribuidora del
Pacifico SA and Peru’s Mayorsa SA for between $300 million and
$400 million, according to a filing posted today on the website
of  Chile ’s securities regulator. The company already had said it
will raise $140 million by selling its 40 percent stake in
grocer Supermercados Montserrat SAC.  “Our plan is to sell these succesful businesses, which
aren’t a part of a core food-retail operation,” Marcelo Galvez,
SMU’s chief executive officer, said in an e-mailed statement.  SMU shareholders will vote Aug. 8 on a $500 million capital
increase to pay debt and fund operations after it announced July
11 that a review of its first-quarter figures revealed it had
breached bond and bank debt covenants. The supermarket operator
is also planning to close about 75 stores and reduce spending by
$160 million in 2014 and 2016.  To contact the reporter on this story:
