Australian  government bonds  rallied,
sending short-term rates to an all-time low, as retail sales
growth unexpectedly stalled before a meeting of central bank
policy makers.  Yields fell across all maturities following gains in U.S.
Treasuries last week when jobs data in the world’s biggest
economy trailed forecasts, damping speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will slow the pace of bond purchases. The  Reserve Bank 
of  Australia  sets policy tomorrow, with traders and economists
predicting a cut in borrowing costs to a record low. The
Australian dollar slid to the weakest in almost three years.  “Some tailwinds from U.S. payrolls and some assistance
from very soft Australian retail figures” drove gains in bonds,
said Hans Kunnen, a senior economist at St. George Bank Ltd. in
Sydney. “With retail sales figures like that, it didn’t spark a
lot of enthusiasm for future economic growth.”  The yield on Australia’s benchmark  10-year (GACGB10)  note fell 20
basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 3.60 percent in
Sydney, after earlier touching 3.57 percent, the least since
June 19. The  one-year  note yield fell 13 basis points to 2.18
percent, after reaching a record low of 2.14 percent.  The Aussie dollar was little changed at 89.11 U.S. cents
after falling to 88.48 cents, the weakest since August 2010.  Retail sales  were flat in June from a month earlier, after
rising a revised 0.2 percent in May, the statistics bureau in
Sydney reported today. Economists in a  Bloomberg News  survey
forecast a 0.4 percent gain.  Rate Expectations  The swaps market is signaling a 99 percent probability that
the RBA will reduce its key rate by 25 basis points to a new
all-time low 2.5 percent at its meeting tomorrow. All but one of
the 27 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News predict the central
bank will lower borrowing costs.  A rate reduction tomorrow would be the second this year and
extend an  easing cycle  that began in November 2011, when the
benchmark was lowered from 4.75 percent. The central bank is
trying to stimulate growth in manufacturing, construction and
retail, as a record mining-investment boom wanes.  The Australian economy will expand 2.5 percent this year,
slowing from 3.6 percent growth in 2012, according to the median
estimate of economists.  In the U.S., the Labor Department reported Aug. 2 that the
economy added 162,000 jobs in July, compared with the median
forecast of 185,000 in a Bloomberg survey. The  unemployment rate 
fell to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
