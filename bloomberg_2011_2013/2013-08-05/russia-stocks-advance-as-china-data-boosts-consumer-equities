Russian stocks rose for the second
time in three days as acceleration in  China ’s gauge of services
boosted appetite for consumer companies in the world’s biggest
energy exporter.  The benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  increased 0.2 percent to 1,394.33
by 10:57 a.m. in Moscow after dropping 0.8 percent last week.
M.video,  Russia ’s largest electronics retailer, surged 9.3
percent, the most in a year. OAO Sollers, the Russian partner of
Ford Motor Co., added 1.9 percent. Crude climbed 0.2 percent to
$107.12 in  New York .  China’s non-manufacturing  Purchasing Managers ’ Index rose
to 54.1 in July from 53.9, the first acceleration since March,
government data showed Aug. 3. Readings above 50 indicate
expansion. Last week’s unexpected gain in a manufacturing PMI
also bolstered confidence that Premier  Li Keqiang ’s policies 
are helping prevent a deeper slowdown in growth.  “The main concern for the Russian market was the fear of a
Chinese slowdown since China is a major commodities importer,”
Andrey Vashevnik, who manages $25 million as chief investment
officer at R&B Investment Fund Ltd., said by phone in Moscow.
The “Russian market is entirely a story of commodities.”  Consumer goods  and consumer services shares led the gains
among nine industry groups on the broader Micex. Russian
equities trade at the cheapest valuations based on estimated
earnings among 21 emerging economies tracked by Bloomberg.  Rates Meeting  OAO Severstal climbed 1.1 percent to 264 rubles and OAO
Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel rose 1.3 percent to 7.966 rubles.  OAO PhosAgro,  Europe ’s largest phosphate-fertilizer
producer, increased 2.1 percent to 996.90 rubles after losing 15
percent last week. Fertilizer producers’ shares slumped in the
five days through Aug. 2 after OAO Uralkali said it would end
production restrictions that underpinned global prices and
suspend a venture with a Belarusian miner that controlled
exports from the former  Soviet Union . The shares slipped 0.2
percent to 158.66 rubles.  The U.S. Federal Reserve pledged last week to continue the
stimulus program which triggered a rally in emerging assets,
while the  European Central Bank  and the  Bank of England  left
 interest rates  unchanged. Bank Rossii will hold a rates meeting
on Aug. 9 after keeping its main lending rates unchanged for a
10th month in July, as policy makers wait for inflation to drop
within the target range of 5 percent to 6 percent.  Lower Volumes  Elvira Nabiullina, who took over the central bank on June
24, is offering banks longer and cheaper funds to help funnel
cash into the economy and boost growth. Russia’s gross domestic
product grew 1.6 percent in the first three months, the slowest
pace since 2009. Russia’s July Services PMI fell to the lowest
since Aug. 2010, according to HSBC Holdings Plc data.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  was little changed at
1,336.80.  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 61 percent
below the 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show, while
10-day  price swings  rose to 12.52. The 50-member Micex’s 5.3
percent decline in 2013 compares with a 1.1 percent drop for
 India ’s benchmark Sensex Index and a 20 percent loss for
 Brazil ’s  Ibovespa Index. (IBOV)   The Micex trades at 5.3 times its 12-month estimated
earnings, compared with a multiple of 10.1 for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
