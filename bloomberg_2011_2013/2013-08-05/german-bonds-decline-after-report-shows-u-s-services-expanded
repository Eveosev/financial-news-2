German  government bonds  fell,
pushing 10-year yields toward the highest level in a month, as
a report showing U.S. service industries expanded in July
damped demand for safer assets.  French and Belgian securities declined as Markit Economics
said a contraction in euro-area services slowed last month,
adding to signs the region is recovering from a record-long
recession. Spanish bonds dropped, pushing up yields from a six-week low. The Netherlands and  France  both sold bills.  “The U.S. services data is quite impressive,” said
Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV
in Amsterdam. “It’s a confirmation of the positive trend we’ve
seen in the U.S. data, and that will point to higher yields for
core bonds, including bunds.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 1.69 percent at 5:02 p.m. London time
after rising to 1.73 percent on Aug. 2, the most since July 5.
The 1.5 percent security due in May 2023 fell 0.32, or 3.20
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,324) face amount, to 98.32.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index increased to 56 from a more-than three-year
low of 52.2 in June, a report from the Tempe, Arizona-based
group showed today. The median estimate called for a gain to
53.1. Readings higher than 50 indicate growth.  Treasuries Drop  U.S. 10-year Treasury notes slid as traders bet growth is
fast enough to allow the  Federal Reserve  to trim bond buying.
The U.S. 10-year yield rose five basis points to 2.65 percent.  Volatility on Belgian securities was the highest in euro-area markets today followed by those of the Netherlands and
France, according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  French 10-year yields rose six basis points to 2.25
percent. Belgian  10-year yields  increased six basis points to
2.56 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Dutch bonds
climbed five basis points to 2.08 percent.  “France and  Belgium  are underperforming,” said  David Schnautz , a fixed-income strategist at Commerzbank AG in  New
York . “Liquidity conditions have worsened in the summer, so
there may be an illiquidity premium on these bonds, where
slightly higher yields are demanded.”  An index of activity in the euro-area services industry
based on a survey of  purchasing managers  improved to 49.8 from
48.3 in June, London-based Markit Economics said in a report.
That’s above an initial estimate of 49.6 on July 24. A reading
below 50 indicates contraction.  Dutch Auction  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said last week
that recent indicators signal the euro region is past the worst
of the slump and data “tentatively confirm the expectation of a
stabilization in economic activity.”  Europe ’s economy stagnated in the three months through June
and will return to growth this quarter after six straight
quarters of contraction, according to a Bloomberg survey of
economists on July 11.  The Netherlands auctioned 2.21 billion euros of 85-day
Treasury bills at zero percent and 1.08 billion euros of 205-day
securities at an average yield of 0.02 percent.  France allotted 3.99 billion euros of three-month bills at
0.043 percent, as well as a combined 3.87 billion euros of 168-and 350-day securities.  Spain ’s 10-year yield rose three basis points to 4.59
percent after dropping to 4.54 percent, the lowest level since
June 19.  German bonds lost 1.2 percent this year through Aug. 2,
while their French counterparts fell 0.2 percent, according to
Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian securities returned 3.8
percent and Spain’s rose 6.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
