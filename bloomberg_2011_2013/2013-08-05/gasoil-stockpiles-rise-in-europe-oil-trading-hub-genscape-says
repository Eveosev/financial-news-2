Gasoil inventories rose 2.9 percent
in Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Antwerp and Vlissingen in the week
ended July 26, according to Genscape Inc. estimates for
northwest  Europe â€™s oil-storage hub.  Stockpiles of gasoil at storage terminals increased to 2.60
million metric tons, up 72,955 tons from a week earlier,
according to the energy information provider based in
Louisville,  Kentucky . The tally slid to 2.28 million on July 5,
from 3.24 million on April 5, before advancing again.  The largest gain for the week was at Vopak Terminal
Laurenshaven in Rotterdam where stockpiles rose 59,332 tons to
432,909 tons, according to Genscape.  Capacity utilization averaged 48.8 percent across the
region, with inventories gaining 10 percent in Rotterdam and
falling 2.9 percent in Amsterdam, the data showed.  Genscape assesses oil storage levels by measuring tank
levels using remote monitoring techniques in the visible and
infra-red spectrum. Antwerp is in  Belgium  while the other three
locations are in the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
