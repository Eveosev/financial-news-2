Australian jockey Simone Montgomerie
died following a fall from her horse at Fannie Bay racecourse in
Darwin today.  Riding Riahgrand in race six of the Darwin Cup card,
Montgomerie “fell and sustained traumatic injuries,” Brett Dixon, chairman of the Darwin Turf Club, said in a statement on
the club’s website.  “It is with great regret that we were advised by the
family that Simone passed away shortly after arriving at the
hospital,” having received treatment from paramedics on the
track, Dixon said.  The Darwin Turf Club said it canceled the remaining races,
including the Darwin Cup, and will conduct a “full
investigation” into the death of the 26-year-old.  To contact the reporter on this story:
