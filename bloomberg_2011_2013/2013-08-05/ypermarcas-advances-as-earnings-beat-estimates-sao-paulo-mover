Hypermarcas SA (HYPE3) , the Brazilian maker
of more than 190 consumer products from diapers to generic
drugs, rose to the highest in two months after second-quarter
earnings exceeded analysts’ estimates.  The shares  rallied  3 percent to 17.08 reais at 11:45 a.m.
in Sao Paulo, the highest intraday price since June 5.  Brazil ’s
benchmark Ibovespa index  gained  0.3 percent.  Hypermarcas’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization rose 12 percent to 258 million reais ($112
million) in the three months through June from a year earlier,
according to a regulatory filing on August 2 after the market
closed. That compares with an average  estimate  of 246.9 million
reais among eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The increase prompted the investment bank Itau BBA to raise
its  recommendation  on the stock to the equivalent of buy. “The
solid second-quarter results made us more confident in the
investment story of Hypermarcas, one of the few companies in our
space where consensus might need to revise numbers upwards,”
Vitor Paschoal and Rachel Rodrigues, analysts at the bank, wrote
in a note to clients today.  Sao Paulo-based Hypermarcas gained 2.8 percent this year,
while the Ibovespa slumped 20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
