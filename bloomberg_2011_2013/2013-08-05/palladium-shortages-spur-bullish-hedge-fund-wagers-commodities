At a time when gold and silver are
tumbling the most in three decades,  hedge funds  are holding a
near-record bullish bet on palladium as forecasters from Morgan
Stanley to Credit Suisse Group AG predict years of shortages.  Demand will exceed output by 1.33 million ounces in 2013,
more than  North America  produces in a year, Morgan Stanley says.
Credit Suisse anticipates deficits through at least 2016, and
researcher CPM Group says mines won’t catch up for a decade.
Prices will average $800 an ounce in the first quarter, 11
percent more than now, and $850 in 2015, the median of as many
as 12 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg show.  Speculators raised bets on higher prices eightfold in the
past year and are holding a near-record amount in funds. That
contrasts with a $60.6 billion slump in  gold  holdings this year
and a $6.3 billion drop in silver as some investors lost faith
in the metals as a store of value. They’re bullish on palladium
because 67 percent of supply is used in autocatalysts, and IHS
Inc. predicts record global car sales.  “The supply situation is potentially very bullish for
palladium, so I am probably the most bullish on palladium
amongst all commodities,” said  John Stephenson , who helps
oversee about C$2.7 billion ($2.6 billion) at First Asset
Investment Management Inc. in Toronto. “Any time supply and
demand are out of whack, we see prices swing.”  Treasury Bond  Palladium rose 2.6 percent to $722.50 in  London  this year,
as gold declined 23 percent and silver 36 percent. Platinum,
rhodium, iridium and ruthenium, typically found in the same ores
as palladium, also retreated. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24 commodities lost 1.8 percent, and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities gained 11 percent. The Bloomberg
U.S. Treasury Bond Index fell 2.8 percent.  Autocatalyst manufacturers will use 7.16 million ounces of
palladium next year, 89 percent more than a decade earlier,
Morgan Stanley estimates. The canisters have honeycomb surfaces
coated with metals that convert emissions including nitrogen
oxides, blamed for acid rain, into less harmful substances.
Tougher environmental laws mean 90 percent of new passenger
vehicles now have catalytic converters.  Mining companies including  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) 
failed to keep pace with demand as strikes over pay disrupted
pits across South Africa, the second-biggest producer. Total
supply is contracting for the sixth time in nine years, Morgan
Stanley says. Sales from Russian reserves, a state secret, will
slump to 150,000 ounces in 2014, from as much as 1 million in
2010, according to Barclays Plc.  Trading Commission  Hedge funds  and other large speculators are holding a net
22,970 palladium futures, after increasing bets in 10 of the
past 12 weeks, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show. Wagers peaked at 25,742 contracts in April. Metal held in
exchange-traded products rose 20 percent to 70.31 metric tons
(2.26 million ounces) valued at $1.656 billion this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The scale of bullish wagers in futures also presents a risk
because it becomes harder to find more buyers,  Standard Bank  Plc
said in an Aug. 2 report. The bets are about double the average
of the past four years, and aggregate open interest, or
contracts outstanding, is within about 5 percent of the record
reached in April, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Platinum is
less crowded and can attract more bulls, Standard Bank’s
analysts said.  Combat Pollution  China , the world’s biggest car market, is limiting auto
purchases in some cities to combat pollution and congestion. The
curbs may extend to another eight cities, tripling the total and
reducing vehicle deliveries by 400,000 units, the China
Association of Automobile Manufacturers said July 10. First-half
passenger-vehicle sales increased 14 percent to 8.67 million
units, association data show.  Rising costs are curbing demand for palladium in jewelry.
The industry will use 305,000 ounces next year, compared with
775,000 ounces in 2009, Barclays estimates. Cheaper alternatives
are also displacing the metal in the electrical and dental
industries, and the market probably will avoid “an acute supply
shortage” because there is enough stockpiled metal, Morgan
Stanley’s analysts wrote in a June report.  Surging prices could also diminish demand for the metal in
autocatalysts. Consumption in the devices fell 40 percent in
2002 after palladium reached a record $1,125 in 2001, according
to  Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT) , which has made one in three catalytic
converters. The all-time high was preceded by shortages starting
in 1997, data from the London-based company show.  Light Trucks  Global production of cars and light trucks will rise 2.2
percent to a record 83.25 million this year and expand another
4.9 percent in 2014, according to IHS Automotive, a unit of
Englewood, Colorado-based IHS.  Automakers (SAARTOTL)  will sell 15.4 million
cars and light trucks in the U.S. this year, the most since
2007, according to the average of 18 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  Mine production contracted in three of the past five years,
according to Credit Suisse. The bank anticipates 6.59 million
ounces of supply from pits by 2016, or 333,000 ounces less than
in 2007.  South Africa  and Russia account for 79 percent of mine
output, increasing the potential for disruptions from strikes
and safety-related closures.  Mining companies are going deeper to find ore, with  Northam
Platinum Ltd. (NHM) ’s Zondereinde mine in South Africa reaching down
as much 1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers). Strikes caused almost 15
billion rand ($1.52 billion) in lost output across the South
African  mining industry  in 2012, according to the National
Treasury.  Three Shafts  Shares of Anglo American Platinum dropped 21 percent to
354.50 rand in Johannesburg trading this year and will decline
to 342.11 rand in 12 months, according to the  average  of 17
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Palladium accounted for
17 percent of sales last year. The Johannesburg-based company
said in May that it would idle three shafts and cut 6,000 jobs
to restore profitability.  OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel (MNOD) , the biggest producer, declined 22
percent in Moscow trading this year. Analysts are predicting the
shares will rebound to 6,080 rubles in 12 months, according to
the average of seven estimates. Palladium generated 14 percent
of the Moscow-based company’s sales last year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “The fundamental expectations are bullish,” said Tom Hainlin, the national investment strategist for Ascent Private
Capital Management in  Minneapolis , which oversaw about $112
billion of assets at the end of June. “The context of a
commodity based on global consumer demand and shortfall in
supply tells me that the metal will remain in favor.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
