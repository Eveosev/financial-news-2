Good morning, dear readers. Here’s some of what I’ve been reading. Fake clicks  on Facebook and Twitter may be rampant That’s what a brilliantly reported investigation by Charles Arthur of the U.K.’s Guardian newspaper shows. And no wonder. A lot of money is changing hands based upon Facebook “likes” and other social-media stats. You may never look the same way again at someone with a suspiciously large number of Twitter followers. Excerpt: “How much do you like courgettes? According to one Facebook page devoted to them, hundreds of people find them delightful enough to click the `like’ button -- even with dozens of other pages about courgettes to choose from. There's just one problem: the liking was fake, done by a team of low-paid workers in Dhaka, Bangladesh, whose boss demanded just $15 per thousand `likes’ at his `click farm.’ Workers punching the keys might be on a three-shift system, and be paid as little as $120 a year. The ease with which a humble vegetable could win approval calls into question the basis on which many modern companies measure success online -- through Facebook likes, YouTube video views and Twitter followers.” Inside the Chinese  propaganda  machine The Atlantic’s Mitch Moxley writes about the year he spent writing for China Daily, China’s largest English-language newspaper, where everything is sanitized for the Communist Party’s protection. It’s an amusing read, and worth keeping in mind every time you read about anything published by the Chinese government, especially its economic data. The pain in  Spain The International Monetary Fund predicts unemployment in Spain will remain higher than 25 percent for at least the next five years. (See page 35 of the above-linked IMF report for the numbers.) The report also suggests ever-so-diplomatically that Spanish banks’ balance sheets are suspect, or at least in need of a good cleaning: “The banking system is stronger, but risks remain elevated. This calls for continuing to reinforce capital, cleaning up loan books (encouraging banks to dispose of assets and to use the proceeds to lend), and removing credit supply constraints.”  Who cares what  S&P  says? It has been two years since Standard & Poor’s stripped the U.S. of its top credit rating. Twelve other nations are still graded AAA. And the outlook for the U.S. is better. From Bloomberg News: “Investors have rejected the notion that the U.S. is less creditworthy with gross domestic product forecast to grow 2.7 percent in 2014, the fastest of any Group of 10 nation, surveys of economists by Bloomberg News show, while the budget deficit is the least since 2008. While an S&P managing director said in March that other credit raters would `catch up’ to its downgrade, the firm and Moody’s Investors Service have since changed their outlooks to `stable’ from `negative.’” More on the  Fabrice Tourre  verdict Michael A. Santoro, professor of business ethics at Rutgers Business School, writes for the New Yorker magazine: “The S.E.C. will tout the Tourre verdict as an important win. The government can tell the public that a Wall Street miscreant has been brought to justice — a rare happening. The verdict may compel some junior Wall Street workers to be more careful to avoid bad behavior, as well they should. Still, one can’t help but wonder whether the derelict senior executives who were most responsible for the financial crisis will be emboldened to continue their ways. It’s a pity the S.E.C. could not close the loop.” Amen to that. (Jonathan Weil is a Bloomberg View columnist.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
