Walter Smith , who won 21 trophies in
two spells as manager of Rangers Football Club, has resigned as
chairman of the Scottish  soccer club  with immediate effect, the
Glasgow-based club said in a statement to the Stock Exchange.  Smith quit after a period of in-fighting at the club, the
British Broadcasting Corporation said, without saying where it
got the information. Smith, appointed as chairman in May, is
expected to make a statement about his reasons for leaving, the
BBC said.  Smithâ€™s resignation came hours after Chief Executive
Officer Craig Mather said calls for his own departure were ill-timed and ill-informed, the BBC said.  Charles Green, a former CEO who led the rescue of the club
last year after it went into administration, has returned to the
club as a paid consultant, the  BBC  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
