U.K. stocks  fell for a second day as
 HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  reported worse-than-estimated earnings,
overshadowing the largest expansion in more than six years for
Britain’s services industries.  HSBC tumbled the most in 20 months after posting first-half
net income that missed analysts’ projections.  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY)  rallied to its highest price since October 2010 after
a report that it aims to pay as much as 70 percent of its
earnings in dividends by 2015.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  slid 28.29 points, or 0.4 percent, to
6,619.58. The gauge has still  rallied 9.8 percent  from a low on
June 24 as the Federal Reserve said it remains flexible on the
pace of bond buying and as the Bank of England gave forward
guidance on interest rates for the first time. The broader FTSE
All-Share Index lost 0.3 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ
Index was little changed.  “HSBC has reported half-year results to the end of June
2013 that are weaker than we and the market had expected at the
pretax profit level,” Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore
Capital Group Ltd., wrote in a note. “The outlook statement
focuses mainly on the macroeconomic backdrop, with no real
comment on the company-specific outlook.”  HSBC, which has a 7.9 percent weighting in the FTSE 100,
shaved off 24 points from the index.  Services Expansion  U.K. services grew in July at the fastest pace since
December 2006, a report showed. An  index  of activity rose to
60.2 last month from 56.9 in June, according to Markit Economics
and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. The median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey had called for a
reading of 57.4. Readings above 50 indicate expansion.  HSBC slid 4.4 percent to 721.7 pence, its biggest drop
since November 2011, as Europe’s largest lender reported first-half net income of $10.28 billion,  trailing  the $10.57 billion
median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “There has been a slowdown in faster-growing markets in
recent quarters,” Chief Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  said.
“Even  emerging markets  go through business cycles, and this has
impacted our revenue and our profit growth.”  Bank Shares  A measure of London-listed banks posted the worst
performance among industry groups on the FTSE 350.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  lost 1.6 percent to 317.4
pence as Societe Generale SA downgraded the shares to sell from
hold, citing disappointing results. Britain’s biggest publicly
owned lender, which may shed some businesses under a government
proposal, said last week first-half operating profit at the
businesses it plans to retain fell 17 percent.  Lloyds advanced 2.7 percent to 75.69 pence. CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio said at an investor roadshow that he plans to pay
between 60 percent and 70 percent of the lender’s earnings in
dividends by 2015, the Financial Times reported yesterday,
citing people familiar with the matter. Lloyds last week said it
returned to half-yearly profit and that it will start talks with
regulators to resume dividend payments.  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , the metals producer controlled by
billionaire Anil Agarwal, rose 3.3 percent to 1,240 pence.
 Lonmin Plc (LMI)  added 2.4 percent to 322 pence and  Anglo American Plc (AAL) 
climbed 1.3 percent to 1,475.5 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
