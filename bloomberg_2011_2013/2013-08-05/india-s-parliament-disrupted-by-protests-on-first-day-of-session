India ’s parliament was disrupted on
the opening day of the monsoon session as the ruling Congress
and opposition parties wrangle over key legislation before an
election that must be held by May 2014.  India’s upper and lower houses were adjourned this morning
after lawmakers from  Andhra Pradesh  objected to the government’s
plan to split the southern state into two. Lawmakers shouting
slogans and waving banners forced the speakers in both houses to
halt proceedings. Parliament resumed at noon after a break.  “We have wasted lot of time in the previous two or three
sessions and I hope that will be not be repeated,” Prime
Minister  Manmohan Singh  said in a statement today before the
session began. “I appeal to the opposition to cooperate with
the government in smooth running of this session, and to ensure
that this session will be productive.”  Singh’s government, weakened by corruption allegations and
the departure of coalition allies, has passed the fewest number
of bills ever by a government sitting a five-year term. With
just the monsoon and winter sessions left this year before
general elections, Singh is running out of time to complete his
agenda amid the slowest pace of economic growth in a decade.  India’s ruling Congress party decided last week to back the
creation of a new province in the south of the country, a
redrawing of boundaries that has triggered protests and fueled
similar demands for separate statehood elsewhere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
