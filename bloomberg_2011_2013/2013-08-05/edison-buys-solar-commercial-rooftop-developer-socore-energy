Edison International (EIX) , owner of
California’s second-largest electric utility, bought closely
held solar rooftop developer SoCore Energy LLC for an
undisclosed price.  “SoCore Energy has built an impressive client base and
pipeline of solar projects with large retailers and other
businesses,” Bert Valdman, senior vice president of strategic
planning for Rosemead, California-based Edison, said in a
statement today.  The Chicago-based developer installed and operates 80 solar
projects in 11 states for commercial customers including
 Walgreen Co. (WAG) , Ikea, Kimco Realty Corp. and  Simon Property Group
Inc. (SPG)  The company was founded in 2008 and focuses on retailers
with multiple stores, real estate investment trusts and large
commercial and industrial clients, Edison said.  Edison Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ted Craver has
said the company wants to boost investment in the rooftop solar
industry, as more customers install panels and tap less
electricity from the grid. In April, Edison bought a stake in
Clean Power Finance Inc. to help the company expand its online
financing service for residential solar systems.  PG&E Corp. owns the largest utility in California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
