Gold futures fell for the fifth
straight session, capping the longest slump since May, as a
stronger dollar crimped demand for the precious metal as an
alternative investment.  The dollar rose as much as 0.4 percent to $1.3233 against
the euro. Gold has fallen 22 percent this year as the greenback
gained 4.2 percent against a gauge of 10 major trading partners.
The metal has also retreated as some investors lost faith in
bullion as a store of value amid concern that the  Federal
Reserve  may slow the pace of its stimulus.  “The dollar’s strength against the euro is pushing gold
lower,” David Lee, a vice president at Heraeus Precious Metals
Management in  New York , said in a telephone interview. “Some
investors are on the sidelines as they want some clarity from
the Fed.”  Gold futures for delivery in December fell 0.6 percent to
settle at $1,302.40 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New
York.  Trading was 49 percent below the average for the past 100
days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Fed said last week it would maintain its $85 billion
monthly  bond-buying program  while warning that persistently low
inflation could hamper the economic expansion. Fifty percent of
the 54 economists in a Bloomberg survey last month expected the
Fed to decide to pare bond purchases in September.  Silver futures for September delivery dropped 1 percent to
$19.719 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery slipped 0.2 percent to $1,448.10 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery rose 0.8 percent to
$735.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
