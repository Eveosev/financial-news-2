Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  tumbled, sending Chinese
stocks trading in the U.S. lower for the first time in a week,
on concern the  Internet company  has risen higher than its profit
outlook warrants.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. slid 0.8 percent to 93.97 in  New
York . Baidu, owner of China’s largest search engine, fell the
most since April, while  Qihoo 360 Technology Ltd. (QIHU)  declined for a
second day.  Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMI) 
surged the most in a month before reporting earnings this week
and  NQ Mobile Inc. (NQ)  jumped 13 percent to a record.  Baidu’s shares surged 40 percent last month after boosting
spending to attract advertisers on its applications for tablets
and smartphones. The Beijing-based company agreed to buy app
store 91 Wireless for $1.9 billion in July, a month after
acquiring PPS Net TV’s Internet video business for $370 million.
While second-quarter earnings beat forecasts, the profit margin
fell to 35 percent from 51 percent, according to a statement on
July 24.  “Baidu’s profit margin is still on a declining trend,”
Echo He, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC, said in a phone
interview from New York yesterday. “We don’t know where the
bottom is. That’s the biggest risk.”  The  iShares China Large-Cap ETF , the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., retreated from an eight-week
high, dropping 0.9 percent to $34.67. The  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPX)  slipped 0.2 percent to 1,707.14 as stronger growth in U.S.
service industries raised concern that the Federal Reserve will
temper monetary stimulus.  Expensive Acquisitions  American depositary receipts of Baidu declined 4.2 percent
to $133.89, paring its gain this year to 34 percent. Before
yesterday’s decline, the shares traded at 25 times  estimated
earnings , the most expensive level in more than a year, and
compared with a multiple of 15 four months earlier, Bloomberg
data show.  Increased competition will force Baidu to seek more
expensive acquisition deals to gain market share, reducing its
margins, according to Maxim’s He, who has a sell rating on
Baidu. Qihoo, the second most-used search engine in  China , is in
initial talks to buy Sohu.com Inc.’s Sogou unit to help it
compete with Baidu for Internet searches, Chief Financial
Officer Alex Xu said July 19.  ADRs of Qihoo slid to $66.02. The shares have increased 122
percent this year, including a 41 percent surge in July alone.  NQ Volatility  Semiconductor Manufacturing, known as SMIC, rose 8.6
percent to $4.03. The ADRs traded about  6 percent  above their
equivalent shares in  Hong Kong , the biggest premium since
December 2009. Over 1.2 million shares changed hands, more than
7 times the average daily volume of the past three months. The
Shanghai-based company is scheduled to release earnings Aug. 8.  NQ Mobile, a Beijing-based mobile security service
provider, surged to a record $17.95 with trading volume more
than triple the three-month average. Piper Jaffray & Co., which
underwrote NQ’s initial public offering in May 2011, raised its
target 41 percent to $24.  One-month at-the-money  volatility surged to an all-time
high of 131 percent on Aug. 2, before retreating to 130 percent
yesterday, Bloomberg data show.  JA Solar Holdings Co., China’s biggest solar-cell maker,
rose 4.2 percent to $8.75. The company said it has secured a
credit line of 550 million  yuan  ($90 million) from the Bank of
Communications of China.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index in Hong Kong slipped
0.1 percent to 9,725.96. The Shanghai Composite Index rose for a
fifth day, gaining 1 percent to 2,050.48 after a measure of the
service sector rose in July for the first time in four months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
