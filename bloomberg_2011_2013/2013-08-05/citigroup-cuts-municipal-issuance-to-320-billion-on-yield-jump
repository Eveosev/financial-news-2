Citigroup Inc. (C)  reduced its municipal-debt issuance projection for the year by 8.6 percent to $320
billion after  Detroit ’s bankruptcy helped push up borrowing
costs to the most in two years.  Interest rates on benchmark munis maturing in 30 years
soared to  4.56 percent  last week, the highest since May 2011,
data compiled by Bloomberg show, after the Motor City entered
the largest U.S. municipal bankruptcy in history on July 18.
Interest rates have been rising since May on speculation that
the  Federal Reserve  would scale back its bond purchases.  As yields increase, states and localities will have fewer
opportunities to refund debt for savings,  George Friedlander ,
chief muni strategist at New York-based Citigroup, said in a
 report  released yesterday. Refundings will drop in the second
half of 2013 by 50 percent, or $44 billion, from the first six
months of the year, according to the report.  “The key factor in this additional cut is that the latest
spike in yields is making a significant portion of potential
refunding volume unprofitable,” Friedlander said in the report.  Citigroup projected 2013 borrowings at $400 billion at the
start of the year. That was reduced to $350 billion in June as
yields rose. The $320 billion estimate is the lowest since 2011,
when states and municipalities sold  $258 billion  of long-term,
fixed-rate debt, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Investors have pulled about $15.5 billion of cash from muni
mutual funds in the eight weeks through July 31, the most since
February 2011, Lipper US Fund Flows data show. Yields on top-rated, 30-year local debt climbed to 4.55 percent yesterday from
4.35 percent on July 17, the day before Detroit filed for
bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
