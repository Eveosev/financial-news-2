Oppenheimer Holdings Inc. (OPY)  will pay
$1.4 million to settle a brokerage industry regulator’s claims
that it had an inadequate anti-money laundering program and
failed to detect and report suspicious penny stock transactions.  The company’s brokerage unit failed to identify as “red
flags” sales of more than 1 billion shares of 20 low-priced,
highly speculative unregistered securities from August 2008 to
September 2010, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said
in a statement today. The firm also failed to conduct adequate
due diligence on a correspondent account of a broker in the
Bahamas, Finra said.  “Broker-dealers area required by federal securities laws
and Finra rules to monitor customers’ accounts so that those
accounts are not used for illegal activities, such as  money
laundering  and penny stock schemes that can cause considerable
harm to investors,” Brad Bennett, enforcement chief for
Washington-based Finra, said in a statement.  Oppenheimer said in an e-mailed statement that it has
significantly tightened its policies relating to the sales of
low-priced shares and enhanced its review of clients’ sales with
respect to anti-money laundering oversight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
