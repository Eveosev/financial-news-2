Rubber retreated from a one-week high
after U.S. jobs data missed estimates and on concern that
slowing growth in  China , the biggest buyer, may cut demand for
the commodity used in tires.  The contract for delivery in January fell as much as 2.8
percent to 241.1 yen a kilogram ($2,433 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange, before trading at 246.1 yen at 10:38
a.m. local time. Futures on Aug. 2 settled at the highest level
since July 26.  Labor Department figures showed U.S. payrolls rose by
162,000 in July, the smallest gain in four months and lower than
an increase of 185,000 projected economists. The Chinese economy
may slow in the fourth quarter and the government will stick to
economic restructuring while avoiding new measures to “bail out
or support the market,” State Information Center researcher Qi
Jingmei wrote in a commentary in the  China Daily  today.  “The U.S. employment data was not as good as expected,
driving a decline on equities markets and spilling over to Tocom
rubber,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst at commodity broker Yutaka
Shoji Co. in Tokyo. Concern that  China’s economy  will slow may
translate into lower demand for rubber, he said.  Rubber for January rose 0.8 percent to 18,150  yuan  ($2,960)
a ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange. Thai rubber free-on-board rose 0.7 percent to 77.25 baht ($2.47) a kilogram on Aug.
2, according to the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand.  Crude rubber stockpiles held at Japanese warehouses fell
9.7 percent to 10,192 tons on July 20, according to data from
the Rubber Trade Association of Japan. Natural-rubber
inventories fell 20 tons to 117,913 tons, based on a survey of
nine warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and
Tianjin, according to the Shanghai Futures Exchange last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
