The  International Criminal Court 
said it rejected appeals by four Kenyans, including deputy Prime
Minister Uhuru Kenyatta, against the confirmation of charges
related to violence following a disputed election four years
ago.  The appeals, including those submitted by Francis Muthaura,
the head of Kenya’s civil service, presidential candidate
 William Ruto  and radio presenter Joshua Sang, were dismissed in
a majority decision by a three-judge panel, the Hague-based
court said in two e-mailed statements yesterday.  The ICC in January charged the four men with directing
violent attacks, including murder and forced displacement,
during two months of clashes following the December 2007 vote.
The violence left at least 1,500 people dead and forced another
300,000 to flee their homes. Economic growth slowed to 1.7
percent in 2008, from 7.1 percent a year earlier, as
agricultural output collapsed and tourists stayed away.  Kenya , the world’s largest exporter of black tea and East
Africa’s biggest economy, is scheduled to hold elections by
March 2013. The charges will be the first time a Kenyan
politician has been brought to trial over an offense related to
the ethnic and political violence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
