The  Washington Redskins  moved up to
the second pick in the 2012 National Football League
Draft, giving the team the chance to select Heisman Trophy
winning quarterback Robert Griffin III from Baylor University.  The Redskins reached an agreement with the Rams last night
to trade draft picks.  “In order to execute each of our club’s plans for free
agency and the upcoming draft, we have agreed to a trade between
our two teams for the 2nd pick in the 2012 draft,” said
Redskins General Manager Bruce Allen and Rams General Manager
Les Snead in an e-mail.  The Rams received three first-round selections, St. Louis
Chief Operating Officer Kevin Demoff told the  Associated Press .
The Redskins own the sixth overall pick in the April 26 draft.  “We will submit this trade to the NFL for approval,”
Allen and Snead said, without offering further details.  The  Indianapolis Colts  are expected to use their first
overall pick to take Stanford University quarterback  Andrew Luck . That would leave Griffin available for the Redskins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
