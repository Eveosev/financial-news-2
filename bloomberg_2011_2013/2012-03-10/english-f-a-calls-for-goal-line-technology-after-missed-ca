England’s Football Association
repeated its “strong desire” for goal-line technology to be
introduced in soccer “as soon as possible.”  The F.A. issued a  statement  today after Queens Park Rangers
had a goal disallowed in a 2-1 Premier League loss at Bolton.
While QPR’s Clint Hill appeared to score with a header, referee
 Martin Atkinson  waved play on even though television replays
showed the ball had crossed the line before goalkeeper Adam
Bogdan knocked it away.  “The F.A. has been a leading proponent of goal-line
technology for many years,” the statement read. “We will
continue to press for its introduction once further independent
testing is complete later this year, so that anyone wishing to
introduce the technology is able to do so at the earliest
possible opportunity.”  The  International Football Association Board , the sport’s
rule-making body, last week approved two companies for final
testing of goal-line technology. A final decision will be made
at a special meeting on July 2.  A disallowed goal by England’s  Frank Lampard  against
Germany at the 2010 World Cup pushed FIFA President Sepp Blatter
to re-examine the issue, two years after the sport’s rule makers
decided not to pursue the technology. FIFA had been criticized
by fans, players and match officials over its failure to adopt
video or computerized ways of monitoring the ball’s flight.  To contact the reporter on this story:
