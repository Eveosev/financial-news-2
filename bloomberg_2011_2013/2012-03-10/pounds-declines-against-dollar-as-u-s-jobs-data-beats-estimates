The pound posted its biggest weekly
drop against the dollar since November as a report showed U.S.
employers added more jobs than forecast last month, damping
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will add more stimulus.  The yield on two-year gilts rose for a second week as
 Greece  said it had invoked powers to force investors to accept
losses on their holdings of the nation’s bonds as part of a
second bailout deal, easing concern the indebted nation will
default on its debts. The pound fell against the euro as the
British Chambers of Commerce cut its 2012 growth forecast for
the U.K. economy.  “With the pound still treading water against the euro we
are seeing a bigger impact go through pound-dollar,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the corporate and institutional
treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc in  London . “The dollar had a
very firm end to the week after a slight upside surprise on the
non-farm payrolls.”  The pound fell 0.9 percent in the week, the most since the
five days ending Nov. 25, to trade at $1.5696 at 3:50 p.m.
London time yesterday. Sterling slid 0.3 percent to 83.57 pence
per euro.  U.K. retail sales at stores open at least 12 months,
measured by value, fell for a second month in February, the
 British Retail Consortium  said on March 6, stoking concern the
economic recovery is faltering. The previous day, the Chambers
of Commerce, a London-based business lobby, lowered its 2012
growth projection to 0.6 percent from 0.8 percent in December.  BOE Pledge  The  U.S. economy  created 227,000 jobs last month, Labor
Department figures showed yesterday, beating the 210,000 median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The  Bank of England  maintained a pledge to buy 50 billion
pounds of bonds by May under its so-called quantitative easing
program and kept its benchmark  interest rate  at 0.5 percent, as
unanimously predicted in separate Bloomberg surveys.  Two-year gilt yields rose five basis points from a week
earlier to 0.44 percent and the rate on 10-year gilts was two
basis points higher at 2.16 percent.  A report next week will show U.K. jobless claims last month
rose by the most since September, according to economist
estimates. The nation will sell as much as 2 billion pounds of
4.5 percent gilts due Dec. 2042 on March 15.  Gilts have handed investors a 0.9 percent loss this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. U.S. Treasuries have
dropped 0.5 percent and German  government bonds  have gained 0.3
percent.  Sterling has dropped 1.1 percent in 2012, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar weakened 2.1 percent and
the euro fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
