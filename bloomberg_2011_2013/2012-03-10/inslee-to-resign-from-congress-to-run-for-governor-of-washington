U.S. Representative Jay Inslee
said he will resign from Congress to run for governor of
Washington state.  “It was a difficult decision, but what I need to do right
now is focus all my attention on talking to people about what’s
really important -- creating jobs and growing our economy,”
Inslee, a Democrat, said in a statement on his campaign  website .  He will step down on March 20, according to his website.
Inslee decided to run for governor after Republican presidential
candidates visited his home state with a “divisive social
issues agenda,” followed by state Republicans offering spending
proposals that “slashed education funding,” he said on his
website.  Inslee “has been a champion of our natural resources while
pushing for new sources of clean energy,” President  Barack Obama  said in a statement today. Obama also said the
gubernatorial candidate “has supported new frontiers in
technology and worked to increase fairness in our nation’s
health-care system.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
