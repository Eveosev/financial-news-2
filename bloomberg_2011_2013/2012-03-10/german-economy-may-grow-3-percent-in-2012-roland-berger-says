The German economy,  Europe ’s
biggest, may grow as much as 3 percent this year on the strength
of its domestic companies,  Roland Berger  Strategy Consultants
GmbH said.  The European Union’s economy may expand 1 percent in 2012,
the global economy as much as 4 percent and  Germany  may repeat
its 3 percent growth of the past two years, the Munich-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement.  Germany has a “good mix of big corporations and mid-sized
companies, many of which are global market leaders,” Roland
Berger’s supervisory board Chairman Burkhard Schwenker said in
the statement. “They follow a European leadership style that’s
superior to the American one, also because it banks on long-term
success instead of quick  shareholder value .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
