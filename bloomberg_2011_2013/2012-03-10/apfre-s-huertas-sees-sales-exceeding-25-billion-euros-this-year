Mapfre SA (MAP)  predicts revenue will
exceed 25 billion euros ($32.8 billion) in 2012, an increase of
more than 6 percent, as Spain’s biggest insurer grows abroad,
Chairman Antonio Huertas said.  International business “will play a relevant role in this
growth, although in Spain we also expect to obtain good revenue
figures,” Huertas said in a speech to shareholders in  Madrid 
today.  The previous chairman, Jose Manuel Martinez, who stood down
at today’s shareholders meeting, led a drive for growth at
Mapfre, setting up a joint venture with Brazil’s biggest bank,
Banco do Brasil SA, and pushed through acquisitions including
the $2.2 billion purchase of Commerce Group Inc. in the U.S.  Huertas said today he would seek growth opportunities in
southeast  Asia  and eastern Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
