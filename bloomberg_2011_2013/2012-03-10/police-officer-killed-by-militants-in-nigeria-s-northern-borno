A Nigerian police officer was
killed when a police station was attacked by suspected Islamist
militants in the northeastern state of Borno, a spokesman said.  “The police division in Bulabilin Ngaura was attacked and
burnt down by suspected Boko Haram members today,” Samuel
Tizhe, a spokesman for Borno state police, said by telephone.
“All the police vehicles and motor cycles at the police
division were burnt, while one police officer has been killed.”  In a separate attack, suspected members of the Boko Haram
terror group set a household in the Ajilari area of Maiduguri,
the capital of Borno state, killing a man and his pregnant wife,
Tizhe said.  Authorities in  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s biggest oil producer, have
blamed Boko Haram, whose name means “Western education is a
sin,” for a spate of gun and bomb attacks in the country’s
predominantly Muslim north. The attacks have killed hundreds
since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
