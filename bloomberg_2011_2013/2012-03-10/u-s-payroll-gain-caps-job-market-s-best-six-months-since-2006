Employers in the U.S. took on more
workers than forecast in February, completing the best six
months for payroll growth since 2006 and showing more
improvement in the labor market.  The 227,000 increase followed a revised 284,000 gain in
January that was bigger than first estimated, Labor Department
figures showed yesterday in  Washington . The median projection of
economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 210,000
advance. The  jobless rate  held at a three-year-low of 8.3
percent even as 476,000 more workers sought employment.  Better  job creation  lays the groundwork for a pickup in
household spending and faster economic growth that may improve
President Barack Obama’s bid for re-election. At the same time,
progress in the labor market may not be enough to satisfy
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who last week said the
job market remains “far from normal” and repeated that
borrowing costs will probably stay low through late 2014.  “The labor market continues to recover, and we’re close to
a self-sustaining expansion where you have job gains driving
income gains, driving  consumer spending , driving further job
gains,” said  Gus Faucher , a senior economist at PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. in Pittsburgh. “Job growth has been
stronger than the Fed was expecting, but I don’t think this
changes their decision-making. They’ve made it clear that they
consider the unemployment rate too high.”  Some 1.2 million jobs were created in the past six months,
the most since the same period ended May 2006. Revisions in
yesterday’s report added a total of 61,000 jobs to payrolls in
December and January.  Stocks rose, capping the fourth straight weekly rally for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The  S&P 500  climbed 0.4 percent
to 1,370.87 at the close in  New York .  Unemployment Rate  The unemployment rate, derived from a separate survey of
households, was forecast to remain at 8.3 percent, according to
the survey median. The jobless rate held steady even as the
survey showed the  labor force  grew. Employment climbed by
428,000 in February, while the labor force rose by 476,000.  The participation rate, a measure of the share of working-
age people who are in the labor force, increased to 63.9 percent
from 63.7 percent.  “The economy has been heading in the right direction --
today’s report is further confirmation of that,” Alan Krueger,
chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said
yesterday on Bloomberg’s “In the Loop” with Betty Liu. “What
we’d like to see is for this job growth to continue, for this to
lead to a more virtuous cycle, which raises aggregate demand and
puts us on a stronger upward trajectory.”  Revised Gain  Private payrolls, which exclude government agencies, rose
233,000 in February after a revised gain of 285,000 the prior
month that was the biggest since February 2006. Factories added
another 31,000 jobs after a revised 52,000 gain.  “There is hiring going on,” Richard Fearon, chief
financial officer at  Eaton Corp. (ETN)  said at a March 6 industrial
conference in New York. The Cleveland-based maker of circuit
breakers and truck transmissions will “definitely need more
manpower to serve” growing demand for tractor-trailers and for
the equipment used in construction and hydraulics, he said.  While there are “positive developments” in the job
market, Bernanke told lawmakers last week the “modest and
uneven” expansion needs the support of monetary policy. The
central bank said in January that economic conditions are likely
to warrant low  interest rates  at least through late 2014.  Refrain From Easing  Policy makers meeting on March 13 are likely to repeat that
view while refraining from any additional easing measures, say
economists, including  Scott Brown , chief economist at Raymond
James & Associates Inc. in  St. Petersburg ,  Florida .  “The  unemployment rate  remains elevated, long-term
unemployment is still near record levels and the number of
persons working part time for economic reasons is very high,”
Bernanke said during a Feb. 29 testimony to Congress. Fed policy
makers judge “that sustaining a highly accommodative stance for
monetary policy is consistent with promoting both objectives”
for stable prices and maximum employment, he said.  The so-called  underemployment rate , which includes part-
time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and people who
want work but have given up looking, decreased to a three-year
low of 14.9 percent from 15.1 percent.  The report also showed a decrease in long-term unemployed
Americans. The number of people without a job for 27 weeks or
more fell as a percentage of all jobless, to 42.6 percent from
42.9 percent.  Employment at service-providers increased 203,000.
Professional and business service employment increased 82,000
last month, including a 45,200 pickup in temporary hiring.  Education and health services employment jumped 71,000, the
most since September 2006, according the Labor Department.  Construction companies reduced payrolls by 13,000 workers
last month, the biggest drop since January 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
