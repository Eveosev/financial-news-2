Spanish publicly traded companies
provisioned more than 7.5 billion euros ($9.8 billion) last year
because of falling asset values, lower growth estimates and
costs of cutting workforces,  Expansion  reported today, without
saying where it got the information.  Businesses making such provisions included phone company
 Telefonica SA (TEF) , builder  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  and wind-farm
operator  Acciona SA (ANA) , , the newspaper reported. Construction
companies were the most affected by falling asset values, mainly
because of their stakes in real-estate companies, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
