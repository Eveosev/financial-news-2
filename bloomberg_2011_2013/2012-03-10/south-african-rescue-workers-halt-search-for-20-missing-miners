Rescue workers called off a search
for at least 20 unlicensed miners who died after a rock fall at
a closed gold mine east of Johannesburg, a labor union said.  One person was “severely injured” in the incident, while
the rescue team is able to recover only one body, Solidarity
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. A tunnel used by the
miners, which runs between the Grootvlei and Gravelotte mines,
will be sealed, it said.  An additional 28 illegal miners have continued working at
the site even after rescue workers asked them to leave, the
labor union said.  The Grootvlei mine is owned by Aurora Empowerment Systems,
a company controlled by President Jacob Zuma’s nephew Khulubuse Zuma and former president  Nelson Mandela ’s grandson  Zondwa Mandela .  To contact the reporter on this story:
