Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said his socialist Pasok party, which is preparing to
elect a new leader March 18, will defy polls showing a slump in
support.  “Our goal is victory, Pasok as the first party, upsetting
the polls,” he said today in a speech shown on state-run NET
TV.  Pasok will vote for a leader to replace former Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  and there has been wide speculation
that Venizelos will run. He didn’t say today whether he will be
a candidate.  Greece  is due to hold national elections in late
April or early May.  Greece convinced private investors to forgive more than 100
billion euros ($131 billion) of debt, opening the way for a
second bailout program worth 130 billion euros. Venizelos said
his party had managed the greatest crisis in Greece since its
civil war.  “Now the key to a return to a growth trajectory is in the
hands of the Greeks,” Venizelos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
