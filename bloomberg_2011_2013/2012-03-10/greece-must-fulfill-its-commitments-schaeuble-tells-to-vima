The success of the restructuring of
 Greece ’s debt, with a higher private investor participation rate
than many had forecast, will be complete if Greece fulfills the
promises it made for a second aid package, German Finance
Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  told the newspaper  To Vima .  While the sustainability of Greece’s debt is based on a
level of 120.5 percent of gross domestic product by 2020, no one
can rule out that by then Greece won’t need a third aid package,
the Athens-based newspaper cited Schaeuble as saying in an
interview to be published in tomorrow’s edition.  The decisions that Greece and the European Union have made
and that the country must now implement, even if they’re hard,
will lead to a Greek recovery, To Vima cited Schaeuble as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
