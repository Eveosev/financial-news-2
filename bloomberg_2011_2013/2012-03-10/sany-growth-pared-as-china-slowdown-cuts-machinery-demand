Sany Group Co. (SANYIZ) , owner of  China ’s
biggest machinery maker, said its sales growth rate may slow by
about half to 25 percent as the economy decelerates.  Sales may exceed 100 billion yuan ($16 billion) in 2012, up
from 80 billion yuan a year earlier and more than 50 billion
yuan in 2010, Xiang Wenbo, executive director of the company
based in Changsha, Hunan province, told reporters in Beijing
today. Sany Group controls  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031) , whose shares
are traded in Shanghai, and assets including a wind-turbine
manufacturing business.  The government this week trimmed its growth target for the
world’s second-largest economy to 7.5 percent from the 8 percent
in place since 2005. China will still encourage infrastructure
investment in western areas, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported on March 7, citing Premier  Wen Jiabao .  “The industry’s extraordinary growth, brought about by the
government’s stimulus package, is not sustainable,” Xiang said.
“Still, the Chinese market will be the best in the world,” he
said.  Sany Heavy last year pulled out of a $3.3 billion share
sale in Hong Kong as the market slumped. Xiang declined to
comment today on when the company will revive the plan.  Sany Heavy said last month it agreed to set up a 900
million-yuan venture in China with  Palfinger AG (PAL) , the world’s
biggest maker of truck-mounted cranes. The company also
announced a 360 million-euro acquisition of concrete-pump maker
Putzmeister Holding GmbH with a partner earlier this year, as
Chinese construction-equipment makers seek to challenge
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Komatsu Ltd. (6301)  internationally.  China’s government plans to boost fixed-asset investment by
16 percent this year, the National Development and Reform
Commission said on March 5, below the 18 percent median of 12
economists’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
