Azerbaijan , the third-largest oil
producer in the former  Soviet Union , pumped 3.56 million metric
tons of crude last month, down from 3.82 million tons a year
earlier.  Natural-gas production grew to 2.13 billion cubic meters
from 2.06 billion cubic meters, State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, the
Baku-based company also known as Socar, said on its website.  In 2011, the Caspian Sea nationâ€™s oil output declined to
45.4 million metric tons, or about 911,000 barrels a day, from
50.8 million tons a year earlier. Gas production fell 2.4
percent to 25.7 billion cubic meters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
