Russian gas transit to  Armenia  via
 Georgia  was halted today because of pipeline damage, Nino
Kikacheishvili, a spokeswoman for the Georgian Energy Ministry
said by phone from Tbilisi.  “Repairs are underway,” after a landslide damaged a
connecting seam of the pipeline last night, Kikacheishvili said.
Russian gas shipments to Armenia were also halted Feb. 20 after
a pipeline leak near the town of Gardabani.  To contact the reporters on this story:
