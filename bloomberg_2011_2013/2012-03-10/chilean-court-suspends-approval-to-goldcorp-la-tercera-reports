A Chilean appeals court has
temporarily suspended an environmental authorization given to
 Goldcorp Inc. (G) , which plans a $3.9 billion mining project in the
Atacama region,  La Tercera  reported.  The court revoked a plan for construction of the El Morro
mining project following a request by an indigenous agriculture
group, the Santiago-based newspaper said. The group said the
company failed to meet a legal requirement to consult with
regional communities.  Goldcorp can petition the court again once it addresses the
concerns of the indigenous communities, La Tercera said. The
newspaper cites Goldcorp as saying it did meet its obligation.  A Goldcorp spokesman couldnâ€™t immediately be reached by
Bloomberg News outside of regular business hours for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
