The University of Cincinnati and
the University of Louisville advanced to today’s  Big East  men’s
basketball championship game.  Cincinnati yesterday upset top-seeded Syracuse 71-68 to
move into the final for the first time since the Bearcats joined
the conference in 2006. Louisville, which beat  Notre Dame  64-50,
is seeking its second championship since it became part of the
Big East in the 2005-2006 season.  Sean Kilpatrick and Yancy Gates each scored 18 points for
fourth-seeded Cincinnati (24-9), which stopped Syracuse’s 22-
game winning streak.  “I walked in the locker room and the guys had written, ‘We
need to win one more’ on the board,” Cincinnati coach Mike
Cronin told reporters. “I didn’t even have to write it. It’s a
huge win for our program.”  Cincinnati took a 17-point advantage in the opening 14
minutes of the game, and then held onto the lead as the Orange
(31-2) rallied in the second half, coming within one point in
the final seconds of the game at Madison Square Garden in  New
York . Dion Waiters came off the bench to score 28 points and Fab
Melo added 11 for Syracuse, ranked No. 2 in the nation.  “We hate losing at the end of the day,” Waiters told
reporters. “Cincinnati came out on fire.”  Gorgui Dieng scored 16 points and Peyton Siva added 13 for
seventh-seeded Louisville (25-9) who denied the No. 3 Fighting
Irish (22-11) on their fifth attempt to reach the championship
game.  The Cardinals, shooting 56 percent from the floor, surged
to a 35-19 halftime lead. Notre Dame connected on 36 percent of
its field goal attempts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
