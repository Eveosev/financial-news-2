Britain’s four biggest banks paid
32 senior executives a combined 103 million pounds ($161
million) last year amid political criticism of their bonuses.  Barclays Plc, which yesterday awarded Chief Executive
Officer Robert Diamond 6.3 million pounds for 2011, paid its
eight most senior executives that aren’t on the board a combined
37 million pounds, according to its annual report. The lender
said it cut bonuses by 48 percent and froze salaries.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  in January urged banks to show
“proper regard” in limiting bonuses and demonstrate how pay is
related to performance as the government executes the tightest
fiscal squeeze since World War II. Banks have tried to assuage
public anger following the financial crisis by limiting cash
bonuses and cutting salaries.  “People are sick of seeing money that should be spent
supporting businesses being lavished on the very people that
brought our economy to its knees a few years ago,” said  Brendan Barber , the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress
umbrella labor organization. “Ministers must do more to force
banks to prioritize supporting the real economy over enriching
their senior staff.”  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  paid 19.8 million pounds
to its top eight employees, with the amounts ranging from 4.7
million pounds to 978,000 pounds.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) 
awarded 16.2 million pounds, with the highest-paid individual
getting 1.2 million pounds. HSBC Holdings Plc divided 29.3
million pounds among its eight, company filings show. The banks
aren’t required to disclose the identities of the employees.  Diamond Pay  Barclays said yesterday it cut Diamond’s compensation by
almost a third and froze his salary for 2012 after the lender
missed its profitability target. His 6.3 million pounds in
salary, bonuses and stock compared with 9 million pounds in
2010.  Barclays said last month it may fail to hit the 13 percent
target for return-on-equity by 2013 after it fell to what
Diamond said was an “unacceptable” 6.6 percent in 2011.  “The board and the committee recognize that our return on
equity has to improve,” Alison Carnwath, chairman of the
board’s remuneration panel, said in the report. “In order to
achieve this, our operating costs need to be reduced.
Remuneration has its part to play in that.”  Diamond is Britain’s second-best paid bank CEO after  HSBC’s  (HSBA) 
 Stuart Gulliver , who received 7.2 million pounds. Diamond is
only Barclays’s third highest-paid executive after two
unidentified bankers received 6.7 million pounds and 6.5 million
pounds respectively. Officials at Barclays declined to identify
the two individuals.  Barclays Capital  Pretax profit at  Barclays Capital , the investment banking
arm led by  Rich Ricci  and Jerry Del Missier, fell 32 percent to
2.97 billion pounds in 2011, the lender said last month. The
bank reduced bonuses for the 24,000 employees at the securities
unit by 30 percent to 64,000 pounds a person.  Diamond’s package includes a 2.7 million-pound stock bonus
and a further 2.25 million pounds depending on how the bank
performs in future years. He won’t receive a cash bonus.  Barclays also made a 5.75 million-pound so-called tax
equalization payment on Diamond’s behalf to tax authorities
after he relocated to the U.K. from the U.S., the company said.
He also received 675,000 pounds in cash instead of a pension
contribution and received benefits valued at 474,000 pounds
including medical insurance, a company car and tax advice.  Hester Salary  RBS CEO  Stephen Hester ’s salary was frozen at 1.2 million
pounds, while he received a long-term stock award the lender
expects to be valued at about 1.6 million pounds, the lender
said in its annual report yesterday. Investment-banking chief
John Hourican will receive about 4.2 million pounds when shares
awarded in 2009 vest in April, RBS said.  Separately, Lloyds gave CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio shares
valued at about 3.4 million pounds as part of his long-term
incentive plan, the lender said in a statement. Lloyds gave nine
executives a total of 3.89 million pounds of shares vesting over
the next three years. Horta-Osorio and the nine executives,
including consumer banking chief Alison Brittain and Chief Risk
Officer Juan Colombas, will also share in 14.4 million pounds of
shares vesting in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
