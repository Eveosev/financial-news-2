U.K. Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg  would back a so-called tycoon tax, requiring wealthy
Britons to pay a minimum rate of tax on their total annual
earnings, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  Liberal Democrat Clegg indicated in an interview that he
may support the scrapping of the U.K.â€™s 50 pence top rate of
income tax provided that high earners pay enough tax, the  Daily
Telegraph  reported. Some high earners pay less than 20 percent
on their earnings because they use lawyers and accountants to
minimise their bill, Clegg said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story: Steve Rothwell in London
