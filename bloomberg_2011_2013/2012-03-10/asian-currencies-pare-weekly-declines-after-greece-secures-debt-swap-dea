Most Asian currencies pared this
week’s losses after the announcement that investors with 95.7
percent of  Greece ’s privately held bonds will participate in a
debt swap and a report indicated  China ’s inflation slowed.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of stocks climbed 0.7 percent
yesterday, capping its biggest two-day advance since January.
Consumer prices in China rose in February at the slowest pace
since June 2010, providing scope for the central bank to ease
monetary policy and support economic growth. Malaysia’s ringgit
fell following a two-day rally as the country’s central bank
left  interest rates  unchanged for a fifth straight meeting.  Optimism about the Greek debt swap “was priced into the
market before the announcement and the announcement is a nice
relief,” said Choong Yin Pheng, manager for economic and bond
research at  Hong Leong Bank Bhd. (HLBK)  in Kuala Lumpur. “China is
growing relatively strongly and people are hopeful for more
supporting policies.”  India ’s rupee appreciated 1 percent to 49.795 per dollar in
Mumbai, trimming its weekly decline to 0.6 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Indonesia’s rupiah rose 0.2 percent
to 9,123 per dollar, paring its weekly loss to 0.5 percent.
Taiwan’s  dollar  climbed 0.1 percent to NT$29.504 and was down
0.2 percent from March 2.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar  Index (ADXY)  climbed as much as
0.1 percent yesterday and closed at 117.42, little changed from
the day before. It ended the week lower for the first time since
Feb. 10. The index’s 60-day historical  volatility  dropped to
3.35 percent, the lowest measure of price swings since August,
signaling reduced market uncertainty.  Greek Debt Swap  Bondholders tendered 152 billion euros ($199 billion) of
Greek-law bonds, or 85.8 percent, after the government offered
to swap their holdings for new securities. Another 20 billion
euros of foreign-law bonds were also tendered, the  finance
ministry  said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  The Greek government will activate so-called collective
action clauses to achieve full participation from holders of
Greek-law bonds. Greece’s use of the clauses triggers payouts on
credit-default swaps, the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association’s determinations committee said in a statement
yesterday.  China’s yuan gained the most in a month after data showed
consumer prices in February rose  3.2 percent  from a year earlier,
less than the 3.4 percent estimate of economists in a Bloomberg
News survey. The currency climbed 0.09 percent to 6.3107 per
dollar, paring this week’s loss to 0.2 percent, according to the
China Foreign Exchange Trade System.  “Easing inflation is good news for  China’s economy  as it
means more room for policy easing,” said  Daniel Chan , chief
economist at BWC Capital Markets in  Hong Kong . “Expectations
that Greece could restructure its debt lifted the yuan.”  Policy Rates  Malaysia’s ringgit slipped 0.2 percent to 3.0093 per dollar.
Bank Negara Malaysia Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz kept the
benchmark overnight policy rate at 3 percent, the central bank
said in a statement in  Kuala Lumpur  yesterday. The decision was
predicted by 19 of 20 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
with one calling for a quarter-percentage-point cut.  The Bank of  Korea  left its seven-day repurchase rate on
hold for a ninth straight month at  3.25 percent  this week, while
Bank Indonesia kept its reference rate at 5.75 percent.  South Korea ’s won closed the week 0.2 percent lower at
1,117.90, while the Philippine peso strengthened 0.3 percent
42.585. Vietnam’s dong was little changed yesterday and climbed
1 percent to 20,830 over the week. Thailand’s baht dropped 0.2
percent yesterday to 30.59, ending the week down by the same
margin.  To contact the reporters on this story:
