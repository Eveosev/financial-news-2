CBS Corp. (CBS)  profit will climb by $180
million this year from political advertising, Chief Executive
Officer Les Moonves said, exceeding the amount received by the
company in the last presidential election year.  Political action committees are boosting the amount of
money being spent on television and radio commercials in support
of candidates and issues, Moonves said today at an entertainment
law conference at the University of California,  Los Angeles . CBS
will take in more political ads than the 2008 presidential
election year, he said.  “Super PACs may be bad for America,” Moonves said, “but
they’re very good for CBS.”  Broadcasters are already drawing record political ad sales
from the Republican presidential primaries, a super-PAC-driven
windfall that will grow even larger in the general election. CBS
Corp. owns 10 television stations in battleground states, more
than Walt Disney Co.’s ABC, Comcast Corp.’s NBC and
News Corp.’s Fox, the other major broadcast TV networks.  CBS, owner of the most-watched  broadcast network , rose 0.9
percent to $30.81 at the close of Friday trading in  New York .
The company, controlled by Chairman Sumner Redstone, has gained
14 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
