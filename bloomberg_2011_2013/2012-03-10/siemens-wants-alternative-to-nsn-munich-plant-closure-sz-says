Siemens AG (SIE)  objects to a plan by
Nokia Siemens Networks to close its site in Munich,  Sueddeutsche
Zeitung  reported, citing an interview with Siemens Chief
Financial Officer Joe Kaeser.  “Siemens will not readily accept that NSN,” the company’s
wireless-equipment venture with Nokia Oyj, “simply disappears
from Munich,” Kaeser said according to the newspaper. “All
parties involved must lead a constructive dialog to try and find
an alternative,” he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
