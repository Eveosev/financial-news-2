German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  is among European leaders calling for a Europe-wide
tax on financial transactions,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing a
joint letter to the EU leadership.  “We’re convinced that a financial transaction tax should
be introduced at the European level,” nine officials including
Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  and French Finance Minister
 Francois Baroin  said in the letter to Margrethe Vestager,
finance minister of  Denmark , which holds the rotating EU
presidency. “We would welcome it if the presidency speeds up
the negotiation process,” the Hamburg-based magazine cited the
letter as saying.  Germany ’s finance ministry is drafting a proposal for a
financial transaction tax affecting revenues from stock and bond
sales, currency transactions and derivatives,  Der Spiegel  said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
