Authorized securities companies in
 Saudi Arabia  are ready to apply Basel III capital adequacy
standards, the  Capital Market Authority  said.  An assessment of the companies showed the industry’s
capital adequacy ratio rose to 35 percent at the end of last
year, compared with the 13 percent ratio required by Basel III,
the Riyadh-based regulator said in an e-mailed statement.  “The result confirms the financial strength of the
securities business companies,” Abdulrahman Al-Tuwaijri, the
authority’s chairman, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
