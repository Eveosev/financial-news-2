Telefonica Brasil SA (VIV) , the Brazilian
unit of Spain’s largest telephone company, will dismiss 1,500
staff in the states of  Sao Paulo  and Rio de Janeiro following
its merger with Vivo Participacoes SA at the end of last year, a
workers’ union said.  The company originally wanted to fire more staff, Sao Paulo
state telecommunications workers union Sindicato dos
Trabalhadores em Telecomunicacoes no Estado de Sao Paulo said
yesterday on its  website . The union negotiated fewer job cuts
and secured a benefit package for those dismissed, according to
the statement.  Telefonica Brasil had about 19,000 workers as of Dec. 31,
according to Bloomberg data.  A company spokesman couldn’t immediately be reached outside
of regular business hours for comment.  Dow Jones Newswires reported the jobs cut earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
