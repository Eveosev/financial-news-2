A top official in Chancellor Angela
Merkel’s party told  Wirtschaftswoche  he has “mixed feelings”
about the  European Central Bank  handing financial institutions
more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) in cash.  “I hope the ECB recognizes its limits and later collects
the money back swiftly,”  Volker Kauder , the parliamentary chief
of Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian
Christian Social Union sister party, told the Dusseldorf-based
weekly magazine in an interview. “Once the European Stability
Mechanism is working, many ECB measures won’t be necessary
anymore.”  Kauder sees no risk of inflation gripping the euro zone,
Wirtschaftswoche said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
