Ersan Ilyasova scored 26 points to
lead the  Milwaukee Bucks  to a 119-114 win over the  New York 
Knicks in a National Basketball Association contest.  Brandon Jennings had 25 points and Mike Dunleavy came off
the bench to add 25 more for the Bucks (16-24) last night at
Bradley Center in Milwaukee.  “Ersan saved the day again,” Jennings told reporters.  Amar’e Stoudemire had a game-high 27 points and 11 rebounds,
while Carmelo Anthony scored 22 points and Jeremy Lin tallied 20
points and 13 assists for the Knicks (18-22).  “They hit some tough shots,” Lin told reporters. “We
didn’t get all the rebounds we should have gotten. Tonight
wasn’t a lack of energy, it wasn’t a lack of heart or will. They
just came out with this win.”  The Knicks, who had a 65-61 halftime advantage, fell behind
in the third quarter as they were held scoreless in the final
three minutes while  Milwaukee  built a 93-83 lead.  In the final quarter, Anthony’s layup with 52 seconds left
narrowed the Knicks’ deficit to 114-113. Ilyasova came back with
a basket and free throw, and Jennings connected on two foul
shots to put the game out of New York’s reach.  The Knicks are third in the Eastern Conference’s five-team
Atlantic Division, 5 ½ games behind the  Philadelphia 76ers . The
Bucks, third in the five-team Central Division, are 16 games
behind the  Chicago Bulls . In the conference standings, the
Knicks are in the eighth and final place for the playoff cutoff,
while the Bucks hold the ninth spot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
