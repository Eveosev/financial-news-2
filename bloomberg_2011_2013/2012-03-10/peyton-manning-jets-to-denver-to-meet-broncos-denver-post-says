Peyton Manning , a four-time Most
Valuable Player in search of a new job since being released by
the Indianapolis Colts, jetted to Denver yesterday to meet with
the Broncos, the Denver Post reported.  Manning, who left the Broncos’ facility after six hours,
without speaking to reporters, is scheduled to visit the Arizona
Cardinals and  Miami Dolphins , the newspaper said, citing an
unidentified person in the  National Football League . Manning
wants to be committed to a team by March 13, the first day of
free agency, the Post said.  Manning met yesterday with John Elway, executive vice
president of football operations; head coach John Fox, General
Manager Brian Xanders and offensive coordinator Mike McCoy, the
Post reported.  Manning, 35, was cut March 7 by the Colts, ending 14 years
with the club that included a Super Bowl title. His release came
on the day before the Colts owed him a $28 million bonus and
$7.4 million salary for 2012. The quarterback missed the 2011
season after undergoing neck surgeries. His doctors have given
him the go-ahead to begin throwing.  The Broncos already have quarterback  Tim Tebow , the 2007
Heisman Trophy winner who led the team to five fourth-quarter
comeback victories in the regular season and an overtime triumph
over the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round of last season’s
playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
