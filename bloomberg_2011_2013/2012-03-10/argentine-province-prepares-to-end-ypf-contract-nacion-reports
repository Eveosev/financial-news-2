Argentina ’s Chubut province is
preparing a ceremony to be held on March 14 to announce the end
of two of  YPF SA (YPFD) ’s concessions,  La Nacion  reported, citing
provincial officials it didn’t identify.  The province gave the country’s largest energy producer
seven days to provide a “working plan,” a period that ends on
March 14, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  Chubut Governor Martin Buzzi said YPF, the domestic unit of
Spain’s  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , failed to fulfill its investment
commitments, La Nacion said.  An official at YPF, who asked not to be identified because
he isn’t authorized to speak publicly, declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
