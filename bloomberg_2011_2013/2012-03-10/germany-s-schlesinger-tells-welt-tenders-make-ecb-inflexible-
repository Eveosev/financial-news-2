Helmut Schlesinger, former
president of  Germany ’s Bundesbank, criticized the  European
Central Bank ’s policy of injecting fresh money into the market
in an interview with  Welt am Sonntag .  The ECB’s most recent tenders in December and February, in
which banks were awarded more than 1 trillion euros ($1.3
trillion), made the institution “completely inflexible,”
Schlesinger was quoted as saying in an interview to be published
by the Berlin-based newspaper tomorrow. “It can really control
only 5 percent of the money it has spent.”  Schlesinger also said he’s concerned over “giant”
imbalances in the bank’s Target 2 securities settlement service,
the newspaper said.  Stefan Nicola in Berlin at +49-30-70010-6246 or
