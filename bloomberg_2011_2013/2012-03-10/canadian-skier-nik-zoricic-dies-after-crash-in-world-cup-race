Canadian ski cross racer Nik
Zoricic died today after crashing in a World Cup race in
 Switzerland . He was 29.  Zoricic, of Toronto, died after sustaining head injuries in
a crash in the finishing area during a heat of the ski cross
finals in Grindelwald, Alpine Canada, the country’s skiing
governing body, said in a  statement  on its website. He was
airlifted to a hospital in Interlaken, where he was pronounced
dead at 12:35 p.m. local time.  “Nik was a very talented young ski racer and a great
athlete who was very much loved by his teammates and fellow
competitors,” said Max Gartner, president of Alpine Canada.
“He will be greatly missed by all of us and the ski community
as a whole.”  No further heats took place after the crash and today’s
 World Cup  race was canceled. The International Ski Federation
