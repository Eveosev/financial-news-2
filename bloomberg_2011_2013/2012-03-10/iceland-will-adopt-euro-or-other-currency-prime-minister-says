Iceland will either adopt the euro
after joining the European Union or drop the krona and
unilaterally adopt another currency as “the situation can’t
remain unchanged,” said Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir.  “The choice is between surrendering the sovereignty of
Iceland in monetary policy by unilaterally adopting the currency
of another country or become a member of the EU,”
Sigurdardottir said in a speech delivered at a  Social Democrat
Alliance  party convention today in Reykjavik, the capital. EU
membership will allow Iceland to “cooperate with EU countries
as a sovereign nation, which has a say in the decision and
policy making in all fields of cooperation.”  Iceland started EU-entry talks in July 2010 and will
probably vote on accession in early 2013. Of a total of 35
negotiating chapters for EU accession, Iceland has opened 11 and
completed eight, the EU said in December. The primary challenges
facing the talks relate to agriculture, the environment and
fisheries, according to EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule.  A Capacent Gallup poll last month showed that about a
quarter of the island’s voters support joining the bloc, or 26.3
percent, while 56.2 percent oppose EU membership.  Iceland could fix the krona’s exchange to the euro and be
sheltered by the  European Central Bank  “as early as by the
middle of next election term” in 2015, said Sigurdardottir.  To contact the reporter on this story:
