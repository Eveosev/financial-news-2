The  Washington Redskins  have
secured the No. 2 draft pick and will use it to select Heisman
Trophy-winning quarterback Robert Griffin III from Baylor
University, Fox Sports reported on its  website .  The Redskins worked out the trade with the  St. Louis Rams ,
who in return will get Washington’s No. 6 pick in the first
round of this year’s draft on April 26 as well as two future
first-round selections and a second-round pick, the network
said, citing comments by Rams Chief Operating Officer Kevin Demoff to The Sports Xchange.  The Indianapolis Colts are planning to take Stanford
quarterback Andrew Luck with the first overall pick in this
year’s draft, leaving the Bears quarterback for the Redskins.  The trade between the Redskins and the Rams won’t be
official until March 13 at 4 p.m. New York time, the first day
of free agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
