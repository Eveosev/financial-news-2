Hong Kong  chief executive contender
Leung Chun-ying is scheduled to appear before a committee of
lawmakers investigating his involvement in a property design
competition in 2002, according to a statement released today by
the candidate.  The committee will meet on March 17, and Leung is scheduled
to appear at the hearing on March 20, according to the statement.
Leung reiterated that he will cooperate with the investigation.  The Legislative Council announced last month it would form
a committee to examine whether there was any conflict of
interest when Leung was among judges in the West Kowloon design
competition. One of the contestants listed his firm, DTZ
Holdings Plc, as an adviser.  Leung resigned as Asia-Pacific chairman of DTZ last year to
join the race for Hong Kong’s top post. On March 25, a 1,200-
member election committee will pick the next leader of the Hong
Kong special administrative region from among three candidates.
They are Leung, former chief secretary  Henry Tang  and lawmaker
Albert Ho.  To contact the reporter on this story:
