Douglas Holding AG (DOU) , a German
perfume and makeup retailer, is preparing to leave the stock
market, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The supervisory board has an extraordinary meeting
scheduled on March 14 to discuss a plan by the Kreke family to
retake ownership of the company, the newspaper said in a preview
of an article to be published tomorrow.  Chief Executive Officer Henning Kreke is in talks with
private-equity investors to realize the plan, the newspaper
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
