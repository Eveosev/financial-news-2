U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
called for equity-market reforms, including ending quarterly
reporting, to encourage companies to take a long-term approach
to developing their business, the Guardian said.  Cable has asked Tim Breedon, chief exeuctive officer of
 Legal & General Group Plc (LGEN) , to help find ways to provide long-
term funds for infrastructure projects and small and medium-
sized enterprises,  the newspaper reported  in an interview before
this weekend’s Liberal Democrat spring conference.  “The government has a positive role to play” in boosting
the economy, Cable said.  He also called for a clampdown on stamp duty evasion and a
simplification of Britain’s tax system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
