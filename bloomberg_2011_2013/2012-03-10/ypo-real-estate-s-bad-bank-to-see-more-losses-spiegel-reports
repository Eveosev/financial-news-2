The bad bank of  Hypo Real Estate
Holding AG (HRX) , the German government-owned lender bailed out during
the financial crisis, will see greater losses than anticipated,

9 billion euros ($11.8 billion) on the Greek debt swap plan, and
losses may rise by an additional 10 billion euros until 2020,
the magazine said today, citing an internal plan by the bank.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
