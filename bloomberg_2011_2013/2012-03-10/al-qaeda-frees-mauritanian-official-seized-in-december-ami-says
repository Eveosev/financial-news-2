Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
freed Ely Ould Moctar, a Mauritanian security officer captured
in December in exchange for one of its members,  Agence
Nouakchott d’Information  reported, citing the gendarmerie.  Moctar was exchanged for Abderrahmane Ould Meddou, also
known as Ridoine, who had been held in prison in Mauritania for
his suspected role in the kidnapping of two Italian citizens in
December, 2009, the closely held news agency said, citing a
person it didn’t identify. The swap took place yesterday, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
