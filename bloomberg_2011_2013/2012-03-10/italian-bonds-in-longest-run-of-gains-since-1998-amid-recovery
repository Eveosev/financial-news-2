Italian 10-year bonds rose for a
ninth week, the longest run of gains since 1998, as the  European
Central Bank  signaled the economy is stabilizing and  Greece  won
the world’s biggest sovereign-debt restructuring.  The gains pushed  Italy ’s 10-year yield down yesterday to
the least since June. Greece pushed through its restructure
yesterday after private investors forgave more than 100 billion
euros ($132 billion) of debt. German  bonds  were little changed
as demand for safer assets waned after U.S. employers boosted
hiring more than economists predicted last month. The ECB left
its benchmark  interest rate  at 1 percent on March 8.  “For the time being, these levels are reasonable,” said
 Orlando Green , a London-based fixed-income strategist at  Credit
Agricole SA (ACA) , referring to Spanish and Italian yields. “From
here it’s pretty much a gradual process. The markets still need
to be convinced of their fiscal credibility.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  slid seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, this week to 4.84 percent at 4:54 p.m. London
time yesterday, after dropping to 4.68 percent, the lowest since
June 7. Two-year yields rose 18 basis points to 1.92 percent.  The difference in yield between Italian and German 10-year
bonds shrank seven basis points this week to 3.04 percentage
points yesterday, after narrowing to the least since Aug. 30.  ECB policy makers see “signs of stabilization in economic
activity, albeit still at low levels,” the central bank’s
president  Mario Draghi  said at a press conference in  Frankfurt 
on March 8, adding that inflation will probably breach the 2
percent limit this year.  German Exports  German exports, adjusted for work days and seasonal
changes, increased 2.3 percent from December, when they dropped
a revised 4.4 percent, a report showed. Economists forecast a
gain of 2 percent, the median of 13 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey showed. The 227,000 increase in U.S. payrolls
followed a revised 284,000 gain in January that was bigger than
first estimated, according to Labor Department figures
yesterday.  The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim
will next week say its index of investor and analyst
expectations, which aims to predict economic developments six
months in advance, rose to 10 from 5.4 in February, according to
the median prediction of 36 economist estimates in a Bloomberg
News  survey . The data is scheduled to be released on March 13.  German bonds have returned 0.3 percent this year through
March 8, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
debt gained 13 percent, and Spanish securities rose 2.8 percent.  The German 10-year was at 1.79 percent yesterday, from 1.80
percent a week earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
