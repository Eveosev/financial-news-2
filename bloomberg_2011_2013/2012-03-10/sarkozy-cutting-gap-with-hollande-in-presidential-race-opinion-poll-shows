French incumbent President  Nicolas Sarkozy  this week narrowed the gap with Socialist presidential
candidate  Francois Hollande  in his bid for re-election,
according to an Ifop opinion poll.  Sarkozy would gather 27 percent of the votes and Hollande
29 percent in a first round of the election on April 22, the
poll for  Paris Match magazine  and Fiducial released last night
showed. The president gained 1.5 percentage points from a week
earlier while the Socialist contender held steady, Ifop said in
an e-mail.  Support for anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen fell 1.5
points to 17 percent while centrist  Francois Bayrou  lost 0.5
point to 11.5 percent, the polling company said.  In the May 6 runoff round of the election between the two
leading candidates of the first round, Sarkozy gained 2
percentage points in the week to 45 percent as Hollande dropped
2 points to 55 percent, Ifop said.  Paris-based Ifop interviewed 922 registered voters from
March 6 to March 9 through an internet questionnaire. The margin
of error is about 3 percentage points, the polling company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
