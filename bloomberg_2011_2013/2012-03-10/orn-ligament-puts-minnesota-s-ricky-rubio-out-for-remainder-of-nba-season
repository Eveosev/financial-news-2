Minnesota Timberwolves rookie guard
Ricky Rubio will miss the rest of the National Basketball
Association season with a torn ligament in his left knee.  Rubio, 21, was injured in last night’s loss to the  Los
Angeles Lakers  and an MRI exam today revealed a torn anterior
cruciate ligament, the Timberwolves said in a  statement  on their
website. He’ll undergo surgery at a later date.  “I feel bad for Ricky having to miss the rest of this
season,” Timberwolves President David Kahn said. “But Ricky is
a competitor, and I am confident that he will work hard to get
back on the court next year and continue his progression as one
of the top point guards in our league.”  Rubio, the fifth pick in the 2009 NBA draft, is averaging
10.6 points and 8.2 assists this season. Minnesota is 21-20 and
trails Houston by one-half game for the eighth and final playoff
spot in the Western Conference.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
