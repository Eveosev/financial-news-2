Endemol NV (EML)  creditor  Barclays Plc (BARC) 
rejected the company’s debt reorganization plan because it
breaches existing financing agreements,  Il Sole 24 Ore  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Under the proposal, the lender would receive a stake of
about 18 percent in the Dutch producer of “Big Brother” in a
debt-for-equity swap, the Milan-based newspaper said. The bank
wants a cash payment instead, it said.  Barclays may take the case to a U.K. court, according to Il
Sole.  “Endemol and the overwhelming majority of its lenders are
continuing to move forward and remain on track toward the
successful implementation of the financial restructuring,”
Charlie Gardner, a spokesman for Endemol, said in an e-mailed
response to questions sent by Bloomberg today. Daniel Hunter, a
spokesman for Barclays, declined to comment when contacted by
phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
