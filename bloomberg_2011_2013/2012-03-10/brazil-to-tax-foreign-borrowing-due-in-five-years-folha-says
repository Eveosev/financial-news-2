Brazil  will tax foreign loans and
bonds by local companies that mature within five years at the
beginning of next week to stem a rally in the real, Folha de
S.Paulo reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  The 6-percent tax, known as IOF, was extended on March 1 to
bonds and loans that mature within three years from two years,
according to a presidential decree published the same day in the
official gazette.  Bloomberg News calls to the Finance Ministry in Brasilia
seeking comment werenâ€™t answered today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
