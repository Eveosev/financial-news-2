An alliance of opposition parties
and groups in  Azerbaijan  said today they will start anti-
government protests on April 8 as the energy-rich former Soviet
republic prepares to host the Eurovision Song Contest in May.  The rally planned for April 8 should be “viewed as the
start of a new popular movement that will bring about cardinal
change in Azerbaijan,” Ali Karimli, leader of the People’s
Front of Azerbaijan Party, told a meeting of the alliance, known
as Public Chamber.  Public Chamber said in a statement that the date of the
rally is not related to the Eurovision Song Contest, due to be
held in the capital of Baku on 22-26 May.  Following revolutions that brought down authoritarian
leaders in Tunisia and  Egypt , the Azeri opposition staged a
series of rallies in Baku in March and April last year. Police
dispersed the rallies, detaining dozens of protesters. At least
13 opposition activists were imprisoned for disrupting public
order and damaging private property.  To contact the reporter on this story:
