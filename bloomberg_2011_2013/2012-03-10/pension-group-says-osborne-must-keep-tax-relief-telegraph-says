The U.K.â€™s largest pension fund
industry group, said Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne 
should refrain from cutting tax relief on pension payments in
his annual budget, the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  The National Association of Pension Funds wrote to the
Telegraph, saying that eliminating higher-rate tax relief on
retirement savings would deter saving and damage the pensions
industry. The industry body fears that Osborne, who will deliver
his annual budget this month, will cut tax relief on pensions to
help plug the U.K. budget deficit, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
