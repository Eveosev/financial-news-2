Minnesota Timberwolves rookie guard
Ricky Rubio will miss the rest of the National Basketball
Association season with a torn ligament in his left knee, the
 Associated Press  reported.  Rubio, 21, was injured in last night’s 105-102 loss to the
 Los Angeles Lakers  and an MRI exam today revealed a torn
anterior cruciate ligament, AP said, citing a person with
knowledge of the situation it didn’t identify.  Rubio, the fifth pick in the 2009 NBA draft, is averaging
10.6 points and 8.2 assists this season. Minnesota is 21-20 and
trails Houston by one-half game for the eighth and final playoff
spot in the Western Conference.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
