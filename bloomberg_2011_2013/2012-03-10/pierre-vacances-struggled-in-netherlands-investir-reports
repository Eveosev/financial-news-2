Pierre & Vacances (VAC) ’s Center Parcs
resorts chain had a “difficult” first quarter in the
Netherlands as unemployment climbed, and business has improved
in the past month,  Investir  reported, citing Chairman Gerard Bremond.  The operator of holiday resorts and accommodation saw
stable business for winter holidays compared with last year,
helped by favorable snow conditions at ski resorts and rising
bookings from middle-class Russians, Bremond told Investir in an
interview published today. He reiterated targets for cost cuts
and increased revenue at the company’s tourism operations by
2014, the weekly newspaper said.
