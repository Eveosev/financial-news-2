A ban on  stock options  proposed
Socialist presidential candidate Francois Hollande would be a
mistake,  Le Parisien  reported, citing an interview with  Unibail-
Rodamco SE (UL)  Chief Executive Officer Guillaume Poitrinal.  Stock options are heavily taxed and contribute to the
government budget, Poitrinal told the newspaper. To avoid the
excesses of some executives, French law should be modified to
tie stock options to the performance of a company relative to
its industry, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
