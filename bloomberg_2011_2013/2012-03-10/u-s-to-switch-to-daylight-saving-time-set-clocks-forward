U.S. and Canadian citizens lose
some sleep tonight as the clock is turned forward one hour,
marking the beginning of daylight saving time.  Most U.S. states will return to daylight saving time at 2
a.m. tomorrow, the U.S.  National Institute of Standards and
Technology  said on its website. The change, which adds an hour
of daylight in the evening, is commonly observed in the Northern
Hemisphere.  Canada  follows the same standard as the U.S.,
according to the  National Research Council Canada .  Daylight saving time begins on the second Sunday in March
and ends on the first Sunday in November. The time change was
first observed in the U.S. in 1918.  The practice isn’t mandatory. Hawaii, most of Arizona and
the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam,  Puerto Rico  and
the U.S. Virgin Islands don’t observe the time change.  Mexico also follows daylight saving time, though the
changes are made on the first Sunday in April and the last
Sunday in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
