Georgian police arrested a man they
accuse of involvement in the theft of one million liras
($560,000) in gold from northern  Turkey .  Police arrested the man along with 400 grams (13 ounces) of
gold, which had been melted down, Interior Ministry official
Soso Topuridze told reporters in Tbilisi today. Police are
searching for other members of the gang and it’s “too early”
to consider extradition, he said.  Thieves made off with about 6 kilograms of gold after
tunneling into the basement of a jewelry shop in the Turkish
city of Ordu, about 350 kilometers (220 miles) west of the
Georgian border, local police chief Hakan Kirmaci said in a
statement carried by Turkish state news agency Anatolia March 6.
The group had spent three days digging, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
