German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said the country needs to invest in its power distribution
network as it phases out nuclear energy.  Merkel, speaking in her weekly  video message  released
today, defended the decision to exit atomic power and said
investment must be made in  power lines  that connect wind farms
in the north with industrial consumers in the south.  “That’s our weak spot and that’s why grid expansion has
absolute priority,” the chancellor said.  Germany, Europe’s biggest power market, shut down more than
a quarter of its nuclear capacity after the Fukushima plant
disaster in Japan last March and plans to stop all nuclear
generation by 2022. The government wants to get 35 percent of
the country’s electricity from renewable sources by the end of
this decade, compared with about 20 percent now.  Ending nuclear power generation gives  Germany  a “good
chance to become a leader in other markets such as renewables,
and that can be very good for us in the future,” she said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
