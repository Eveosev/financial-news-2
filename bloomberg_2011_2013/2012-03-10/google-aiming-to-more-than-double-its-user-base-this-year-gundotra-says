Google Inc. (GOOG)  aims to more than
double the number of people on its social-networking service
this year, which has already reached 100 million active users.  The growth of Google+ has surpassed any estimates the
company had, said  Vic Gundotra , a senior vice president in
charge of social initiatives. Google unveiled the service last
June, challenging the dominance of Facebook Inc.’s site.  “We’re pretty impressed,” Gundotra said in an interview
yesterday on Bloomberg Television. “We’re pretty blown away by
the adoption of Google+.”  Google added the social-networking service in a bid to keep
users on its site longer and boost ad revenue. The company said
in January that Google+ had topped 90 million members, more than
double the amount in October. Still, its user base is dwarfed by
 Facebook Inc. (FB) ’s 845 million-plus members. And ComScore Inc.
estimates that Google+’s members spend a fraction of the time on
the site than their Facebook counterparts.  Google+ is the basis for a broader shift at the  Mountain
View , California-based company, Gundotra said.  “Google+ could be viewed as Google 2.0,” he said.
“Google+ is the next generational of all of Google becoming
unified because it understands you and your relationships. And
so all services get better.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
