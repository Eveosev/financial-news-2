Canada ’s dollar strengthened
against most of its major peers after the central bank said
conditions in the domestic economy and European debt markets are
improving and U.S. employers added more jobs than forecast.  The currency touched the strongest in almost two months
versus the euro this week on speculation the Bank of Canada is
less likely to reduce interest rates than its European
counterpart. The Canadian dollar rose against the majority of it
most-traded counterparts before Bank of Canada Senior Deputy
Governor Tiff Macklem is due to speak in Sal Paulo on March 12.  “Expectations for rate cuts in Canada have been pared
back,” said Brian Kim, a currency strategist in  Stamford ,
Connecticut, at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. “Another
strong labor report in the U.S. points to continued relative
economic outperformance versus other developed areas. The
Canadian dollar should benefit.”  The loonie, nicknamed for the image of the aquatic bird on
the C$1 coin, rose 0.4 percent on the week to C$1.2996 against
the euro yesterday in Toronto, the highest since Jan. 18. It
fell 0.1 percent to 99.05 cents per U.S. dollar. One Canadian
dollar purchases $1.00096.  The loonie strengthened 0.9 percent over the past week, the
second-best performer after the greenback’s 1 percent gain,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a
gauge of 10 developed-nation currencies. The euro gained 0.4
percent.  Canada’s currency touched 98.73 cents yesterday versus the
greenback, the most since it reached 98.42 cents on March 1, the
strongest since September.  Long Bonds Fall  Longer-term  government bonds  fell, pushing the yield on the
benchmark  10-year note  higher by six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 2.02 percent. The yield reached 1.837
percent in December, a record low.  Yields on Canada’s  two-year note  gained six basis points to
1.17 percent, the highest since August, as traders speculated
the central bank was moving closer to raising rates.  The loonie rose yesterday after the U.S. reported nonfarm
payrolls increased by 227,000 in February after jumping by a
revised 284,000 the prior month, data from the Labor Department
showed today. The U.S.  unemployment rate  held at a three-year
low of 8.3 percent. Economists had predicted gains of 210,000
and a steady jobless rate.  “Buy  North America ,” said  Shaun Osborne , Toronto-based
chief currency strategist at  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) ’s TD
Securities unit. “Better U.S. numbers are better for the
Canadian dollar.”  Employment Falls  Canadian  employment  declined by 2,800 after a January
increase of 2,300,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa. The
unemployment rate dropped to 7.4 percent from 7.6 percent as
37,900 people left the  labor force , the largest drop since
January 2009. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had forecast
an increase of 15,000 jobs and a 7.6 percent unemployment rate.  Among its Group of Seven peers, Canada’s  yield curve  is the
flattest amid prospects for rising interest rates after Bank of
Canada Governor  Mark Carney  signaled conditions that kept him
sidelined are easing.  Canadian 10-year bonds yielded 84 basis points more than
two-year debt yesterday, the least since September 2008,
narrowing from 135 basis points in October.  Japan ’s curve stood
at 87 basis points, compared with 173 and 171 basis points in
the U.S. and the U.K. German, French and Italian curves were at
least 163 basis points.  The central bank kept its main  interest rate  at 1 percent
on March 8, extending the longest pause since the 1950s, and
said there’s less slack in the economy amid easing global
tensions and faster domestic spending that may lift prices.  The yield on the September 2012 bankers’ acceptances
contract, a barometer of short-term rate expectations, rose to
1.33 percent yesterday, the highest this year, indicating
traders are betting rate increases are more likely.  “Our current trade recommendations include long Canadian
dollar versus both the euro and the  U.S. dollar ,” said RBS’s
Kim. A long position is a bet a security will rise in value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
