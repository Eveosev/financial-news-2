Russia  has no grounds to ban grain
exports this season, according to Pavel Skurikhin, president of
the country’s Grain Producers’ Union.  Russia’s grains harvest is seen at below 80 million metric
tons in the season that started July 1 because of factors
including drought, Skurikhin said today at a news conference in
Moscow.  Drought in the country’s south in May and June is now in
Siberia’s Altai region, Skurikhin said. Altai was the fifth
biggest grain growing region in Russia last year after it
harvested 3.9 million tons of grain, state statistics data show.  Other reasons of a lower crop include high cost of loans
for farmers and aging agricultural machines, limited usage of
fertilizers and pesticides, he said.  Still, the crop will meet domestic demand of about 73
million tons, he said, and carryover stocks are seen at about 15
million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
