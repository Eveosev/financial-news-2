The  Turkish military  said materials
recovered after a plane was shot down by  Syria  on June 22 have
revealed no evidence of any explosive matter, flammable material
or traces of ammunition.  The military forensic unit’s inspection of material found
on the sea surface “has found no evidence that meets the
profile of a petroleum-based fire-triggering or accelerating
substance, residue of organic or inorganic explosive matter, or
findings that could be assessed as belonging to any
ammunition,” according to a statement on the military’s website
posted yesterday.  The military is inspecting pieces of the F-4 air force
jet remaining on the bottom of the  Mediterranean Sea  using
camera images, according to the statement.  The E/V Nautilus, the exploration ship that discovered the
wreckage, has left the area after a malfunction in its camera
system, and the military is looking for new ways to bring the
wreckage from the sea bed to the surface, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
