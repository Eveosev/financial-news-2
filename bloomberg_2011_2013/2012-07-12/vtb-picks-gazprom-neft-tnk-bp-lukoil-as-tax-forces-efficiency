OAO Lukoil, TNK-BP and OAO Gazprom
Neft were named as VTB Capital’s top picks due to efficiency
gains in response to  Russia ’s domestic tax policy.  “The Russian oil sector represents a good investment
opportunity, despite investors’ appetite being dented by the
perception that revenue-based Russian oil taxation is
insufferably heavy,” VTB analysts led by Dmitry Loukashov said
in a research note published today.  A high, revenue-based tax system combined with low
corporate tax has provided incentives for  oil companies  to
invest in efficiency, according to VTB.  The Russian government derived half of its income from oil
and gas last year. That came mainly from Russia’s export duties
on crude and products as well as extraction taxes, which are
based on prices for Russia’s Ural’s crude export blend.  VTB named TNK-BP as Russia’s most efficient performer
followed by Gazprom Neft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
