U.K. stocks  fell, led by a selloff
in mining companies, after minutes from the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s latest policy meeting failed to signal more stimulus
measures to spur economic growth.  Rio Tinto (RIO)  Group and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BLT)  both fell more than 3
percent as reports from Australia to Japan added to signs of
slowing global growth.  Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM)  sank 6.7 percent after
the fund manager reported a fall in assets.  G4S (GFS)  Plc slid 2.6
percent after the security company said it wouldn’t be able to
supply enough guards for the London Olympics.  The FTSE 100 Index dropped 56.23 points, or 1 percent, to
5,608.25 at the close in London. The broader FTSE All-Share
Index slipped 0.9 percent today. Ireland’s ISEQ Index slid 1.2
percent as Dublin-based broadcaster RTE reported the country’s
economy contracted in the first quarter by 1.1 percent.  “Disappointment has set in as the world’s most powerful
central bank still seems unwilling to provide another sugar rush
of cheap money,” said Chris Beauchamp, a market analyst at IG
Index. “The minutes of the most recent Fed meeting did not
suggest that policy makers in the US were about to embark on
more extensive easing measures.”  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  has advanced 6.6 percent from its 2012 low on
June 1 as central banks and policy makers took steps to support
global growth. The volume of shares changing hands on the gauge
was 25 percent lower today than the 30-day average, Bloomberg
data show.  Fed Minutes  Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s June
meeting showed that two participants supported additional bond
purchases, while two others said only a further deterioration in
the economy would warrant them.  Members also said strains in global markets stemming from
Europe’s debt crisis had increased since their April meeting,
and that “U.S. fiscal policy would be more contractionary than
anticipated.”  Rio Tinto, the world’s third-largest mining company,
declined 3.5 percent to 2,926 pence.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  the
biggest, slid 3.3 percent to 1,751 pence, while  Anglo American
Plc (AAL)  dropped 2.2 percent to 2,010 pence.  Copper led base metals lower on the London Metal Exchange
as  South Korea  unexpectedly cut interest rates and Australia’s
jobless rate rose, adding to concern the global economic
slowdown is deepening.  Ashmore Falls  Ashmore Group declined 6.7 percent to 307.8 pence after the
U.K. fund manager said assets under management fell 3.3 percent
to $63.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Separately, Barclays Plc
lowered its recommendation for the  asset manager  to equal
weight, the equivalent of hold, from overweight.  G4S retreated 2.6 percent to 283 pence. The U.K. government
said it will deploy troops to provide security at London Olympic
venues after G4S said it wouldn’t have enough staff available.  Aegis Group Plc (AGS)  surged 45 percent to 235.3 pence after
Japan’s Dentsu Inc., an 111-year-old advertising company, agreed
to buy the British firm for 3.16 billion pounds ($4.9 billion).  Aegis shareholders will get 240 pence in cash, or 48
percent more than the stock’s close in London yesterday, in an
offer recommended by directors. Dentsu has bought a 15 percent
stake and agreed to acquire a further 5 percent from companies
controlled by  Vincent Bollore , Aegis’s largest shareholder.  Premier, Rockhopper  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  rallied 2.1 percent to 366.3 pence after
the company agreed to buy a 60 percent stake in  Rockhopper
Exploration Plc (RKH) ’s Falkland Island assets, including the
territory’s first commercial discovery in the Sea Lion prospect.
The company is planning production as early as 2017.  Rockhopper slumped 9.3 percent to 248.5 pence after earlier
surging as much as 16 percent.  SuperGroup Plc (SGP) , the maker of Superdry clothing, jumped 15
percent to 385 pence as earnings stabilized, helping to restore
confidence after the company cut forecasts three times in a
year.  Underlying pretax profit fell to 42.8 million pounds in the
year ended April 29, from 47.3 million pounds a year earlier.
That compared with the 43 million-pound average estimate of 10
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue in the period rose 32
percent from a year earlier to 313.8 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
