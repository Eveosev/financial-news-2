Treasuries pared gains, lifting the
10-year note  yield  up from almost the lowest ever, as a
government report showed U.S. initial jobless claims were lower
than forecast, damping concern the labor market is faltering.  Treasuries rose earlier along with the bonds of other
highly rated nations amid concern central banks need to take
more action to sustain faltering global growth, spurring demand
for the safest assets. Thirty-year bond yields rose from almost
a record low before the government sells $13 billion of the
securities today.  The 10-year Treasury  yield  fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.50 percent at 8:32 a.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield dropped to
a record 1.4387 percent on June 1.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased by 26,000 in
the week ended July 7 to 350,000, the fewest since March 2008,
Labor Department figures showed today. Economists forecast
372,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. Last weekâ€™s distortion is likely to unwind slowly
over coming weeks, a Labor Department spokesman said as the data
was released to the press.  To contact the reporter on this story:
