Nigeria’s naira weakened for a third
day against the dollar, extending this week’s decline, as a drop
in  oil prices  cut prospects for income from the West African
nation’s key export.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer depreciated
less than 0.1 percent to 161.27 per dollar on the  interbank
market  as of 2 p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The naira has lost 0.2 percent
this week.  Oil fell in  New York  on signs from Asia and the U.S. that
the global recovery is faltering and eroding demand for fuels.
Nigerian benchmark  Bonny Light crude  slipped 1.1 percent,
extending declines since the end of April to 17 percent.  Nigeria’s  foreign-currency reserves  have fallen by $1.2
billion since the end of May to $36.49 billion, according to
July 10 data compiled by the Abuja-based central bank.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s domestic 15.1 percent bonds due 2017
rose six basis points to 16.04 percent, according to July 11
data on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website.
Yields on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 rose
one basis point to 5.54 percent today.  Ghana’s cedi strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 1.954
per dollar in Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
