A political official in southern
France is urging the nation’s restaurants to stop serving
 California  wines in response to the U.S. state’s ban on foie
gras.  California banned the sale and production of the French
delicacy, a fatty goose or duck liver made by force-feeding the
animals, under a law that took effect July 1. Most restaurants
in the state have removed the item from their menus.  “I call on all the restaurants in France that sell
Californian wine to stop doing so in a show of solidarity for
our foie gras makers and, more broadly, for all food makers,”
said Philippe Martin, the president of the general council in
the Gers department, near the Pyrenees mountains.  The Gers , in the heart of Gascony, is an agricultural area
known for goose foie gras.  France  produces more than 16,000 tons
of foie gras annually, or two-thirds of the product sold
globally, according to Mirepoix USA, a Reno, Nevada-based online
foie gras retailer. The French consume 75 percent of the world
production.  “This won’t have severe impact on the Gers region trade
balance, let alone the French trade, or the California trade
balance, but we had to send a strong signal because we think
this is an unfair measure,” Martin said yesterday in a
telephone interview.  California produced 90 percent of the $1.4 billion in U.S.
wine exports in 2011, according to the Wine Institute, a San
Francisco-based trade group. Little is exported to France, said
Terry Hall, a spokesman for Napa Valley Vintners, a  St. Helena ,
California-based group representing 430 wineries.  ‘Not Keen’  “There’s not going to be a lot of California wine to
boycott,” Hall said. “France is a major producer. They’re not
keen on a lot of imports, especially from California.”  France was the second-largest exporter of wines to the U.S.
behind  Italy  in 2011, according to the Commerce Department.
French wine imports reached $253.5 million in the first quarter
of this year.  “Why would you take it out on the wine industry,
especially when Americans are an incredible supporter of the
French wine market?” Hall said.  This is not the first time that politics has intruded on
culinary relations between the two nations. In 2003, the U.S.
House of Representatives responded to France’s opposition to the
invasion of  Iraq  by renaming the French fries served in its
cafeteria, calling them “Freedom Fries.”  In California, the foie gras ban is pitting chefs against
animal-rights activists. Restaurateurs say no one should dictate
what people may eat, while the activists, who encouraged
enactment of the law, say force-feeding the animals through a
tube in their esophagus is cruel.  $1,000 Fine  Those violating the ban are subject to a fine of as much as
$1,000 for each day it continues. Still, municipal police
departments and animal-control agencies, which are responsible
for enforcing the law, have expressed little interest in issuing
citations.  Hudson Valley Foie Gras, a New York-based producer, Hot’s
Restaurant Group Inc., which owns two restaurants in the Los
Angeles area, and Association des Eleveurs de Canards et d’Oies
du  Quebec , a Canadian non-profit representing foie gras
producers, sued on July 2 to block enforcement. They argue that
restaurants and distributors who sell duck products can’t know
how the fowl was fed and whether it was forced.  To contact the reporters on this story:
