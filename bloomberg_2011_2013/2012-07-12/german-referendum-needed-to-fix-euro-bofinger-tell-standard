Peter Bofinger , an economic adviser
to German Chancellor  Angela Merkel , said Germany will probably
need a referendum before politicians fix the structural defects
of Europe’s currency, Vienna’s Der Standard newspaper reported,
citing an interview.  While the German judicial system weighs the legality of the
European Stability Mechanism “the best way in Germany would be
to hold a referendum,” he told the newspaper.  “The problem we have now is not a problem of
constitutional politics but that, for two years now, small-scale
solutions have been tried to solve a systemic crisis,” Bofinger
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
