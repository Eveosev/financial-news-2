Venezuelan opposition candidate
Henrique Capriles Radonski said President  Hugo Chavez  has
nothing left to offer the country after almost 14 years in power
and the Oct. 7 election will be a choice between the
“future and more of the same.”  Capriles, 40, toured Cojedes state today as part of his
town-by-town campaign where he said residents complained of
deteriorating public services, violence and unemployment.  “This government has nothing new to offer the country, 14
years are enough,” Capriles said in a speech broadcast on
Globovision and also carried by state television. “This is a
choice between a people that want to progress and a government
that wants to stay in power.”  Capriles has broadened his strategy since the official
start of the campaign on July 1 to visit several towns in a
state per day after visiting residents house-by-house following
his landslide win in a February primary election. The former
governor of Miranda state said that he would strengthen the
government’s current social programs by protecting the rights of
the beneficiaries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
