Canadian natural gas fluctuated,
declining after a U.S. report showed stockpiles increased more
than expected and gaining on forecasts of more heat that may
signal demand for the fuel.  August gas in  Alberta  declined 0.7 percent as the Energy
Department said  U.S. stockpiles  expanded by 33 billion cubic
feet to 3.135 trillion, compared with 87 bcf a year earlier.
 Analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg showed an expected
increase of 27 billion cubic feet. The price gained 0.2 percent
earlier as MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg,  Maryland ,
predicted temperatures would increase in the U.S. Midwest and
Northeast next week.  “It’s rainy and cool in Houston but the rest of the
country is still hot,”  Kyle Cooper , director of research with
IAF Advisors in Houston, said in a telephone interview. “That
33-billion-cubic-feet injection was still way below last year,
we took out over 50 bcf in storage surplus, so from that
perspective it’s not quite as bearish.”  Alberta gas for August delivery decreased 1.5 cents to
C$2.28 per gigajoule ($2.12 per million British thermal units)
as of 1:30 p.m.  New York  time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Alberta gas has fallen 12 percent this year, from C$2.58 on
Dec. 31, and risen 40 percent from C$1.625 at the end of March.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  gained 2.4 cents to $2.877 per million Btu at 1:33 p.m.  Hotter Weather  “The heat within the Midwest and East is still favored to
peak during the first couple days of the period, with plenty of
mid- to upper-90s in store,” MDA said in a forecast today for
July 17-21. “This heat will weaken some by mid- to late period,
but most of these areas will remain well to the hotter side of
normal throughout.”  The high in Chicago on July 21 may be 96 degrees Fahrenheit
(36 Celsius), 12 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania . A day later, New York may reach 93,
9 more than usual.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.7 billion cubic
feet at 1:30 p.m. Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.93
billion cubic feet at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is
transferred to TransCanada’s main Line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.99 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at Kingsgate was 745 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.87 billion cubic feet today, or 71 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.75
billion cubic feet at 12:25 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
