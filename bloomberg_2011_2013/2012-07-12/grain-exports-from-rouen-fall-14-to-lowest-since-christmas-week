Grain exports from the French port
of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell 14 percent
in the latest week to their lowest level since the week ended
Dec. 28 that included the Christmas holiday.  Cargoes slid to 27,026 metric tons between July 5 and July
11 from 31,368 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River port  wrote
in an e-mailed report today. That included 25,321 tons of soft
wheat, more than double the prior week’s 11,545 tons.  Portugal  was the main destination with 12,400 tons of soft
wheat, the biggest weekly wheat shipment to the country since at
least August 2010, followed by  Guinea  with 7,700 tons.  Rouen accounted for 41 percent of  France ’s grain exports by
sea in 2010-11, ahead of La Pallice on the Bay of Biscay and
Dunkirk on the  North Sea , which shipped out 17 percent and 11
percent respectively, according to port figures.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in metric tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
