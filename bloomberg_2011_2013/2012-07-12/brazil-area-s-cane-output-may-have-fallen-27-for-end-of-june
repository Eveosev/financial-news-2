Sugar cane output in  Brazil ’s center
south, the main growing region of the world’s biggest producer,
probably fell 27 percent for the second half of June, according
to Newedge Group SA.  Cane production in the area was an estimated 30.5 million
metric tons in the period, down from 42 million tons a year
earlier,  Michael McDougall , head of the Brazil desk at Newedge
in  New York , said in a report e-mailed today. Industry group
Unica is scheduled to update its harvest figures today.  The report “will continue to show harvesting and sugar
production falling further behind last year and looking worse on
the industrial yield,” McDougall said. The sugar content in the
cane was probably about 124.5 kilograms (274.5 pounds) a ton,
down from last year’s level of 133.5 kilograms a ton, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
