General Motors Co. (GM)  plans to bring
most of its information technology work in-house, Randy Mott,
chief information officer, told reporters.  GM intends to have 90 percent of such work done internally,
up from 10 percent currently, Mott said in Detroit. GM will pare
its data centers to two from 23.  The automaker plans to hire thousands of people as part of
shifting work that has been done by contractors, Mott said.
About 1,500 of 10,000 people working on information technology
for the company are employees, he said.  Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson wants the Detroit-based
automaker to increase its operating margins after a record
annual profit of $9.19 billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
