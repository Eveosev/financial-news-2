Oil rose after the U.S. announced
more sanctions on  Iran , the second-biggest crude-producing
member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Futures climbed 0.3 percent as the U.S. said it will target
Iran’s weapons proliferation networks and “front companies”
used to evade international sanctions. Crude dropped earlier as
the euro fell to a two-year low against the dollar and the
 International Energy Agency  forecast “muted” growth in oil
demand in 2013.  “Concern that the new sanctions will disrupt supply are
lending the market support,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The big picture
for the global economy remains pretty bleak.”  Crude oil for August delivery increased 27 cents to settle
at $86.08 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
have decreased 13 percent this year.  Brent oil for August settlement climbed 84 cents, or 0.8
percent, to end the session at $101.07 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange. It was the highest settle
since May 31. The European benchmark contract traded at $14.99
premium to New York-traded West Texas Intermediate crude, the
most since June 11.  Daily exports of the 12 main grades of North Sea crude for
loading in August will slump to the lowest level in 26 months,
according to data obtained by Bloomberg. Shipments of Forties,
one of the four grades that make up the benchmark Dated Brent,
will drop by 21 percent to 290,323 barrels a day next month, the
least in more than five years, because of planned maintenance.  “The Brent market is focused on the nearby maintenance
that will hurt production,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst
at Citi Futures Perspective in New York.  Intended Impact  The increase in sanctions is intended to disrupt Iran’s
“nuclear and ballistic-missile programs as well as its
deceptive efforts to use front companies to sell and move its
oil,” the Treasury Department said in a statement today.  The Treasury identified as sanction targets four entities
it said were being used to facilitate Iran’s oil trade: Petro
Suisse Intertrade Company SA (Petro Suisse), incorporated in
Switzerland;  Hong Kong  Intertrade Co., based in Hong Kong; Noor
Energy ( Malaysia ) Ltd., incorporated in Malaysia; and Petro
Energy Intertrade Co., operating out of Dubai.  Iranian Production  Crude-oil output in Iran declined 65,000 barrels to 3.16
million barrels a day last month, the lowest level since June
1992, according to a Bloomberg survey of  oil companies ,
producers and analysts.  Oil in New York tumbled as much as 1.9 percent earlier as
the euro dropped as much as 0.6 percent to $1.2167, the lowest
level since June 30, 2010. A stronger dollar reduces the appeal
of raw materials as an investment alternative.  U.S.  consumer confidence  stagnated last week. The Bloomberg
Consumer Comfort Index held at minus 37.5 in the week ended July
8. Some 86 percent of those surveyed said the economy was in bad
shape, 21 percentage points higher than the average since 1985.  “The economic picture remains negative with the  European
debt crisis  and concerns about  China ,” said  John Kilduff , a
partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based energy hedge
fund.  A Chinese government report tomorrow may show gross
domestic product grew 7.7 percent in the second quarter from a
year earlier, the least in more than three years, according to
the  median estimate  of 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
China is the world’s second-biggest crude-consuming country
after the U.S.  Crude Demand  Oil demand will increase by a “relatively muted” 1
million barrels a day, or 1.1 percent, to an average of 90.9
million in 2013, the Paris-based IEA said today in its first
outlook for the coming year. Global oil use in emerging
economies will surpass that of developed nations for the first
time in 2013, the IEA forecasts.  Production of crude from outside OPEC will climb next year,
led by additional output from  Canada , the U.S. and  Brazil , the
IEA said. Non-OPEC producers will bolster supplies by 700,000
barrels a day to average 53.9 million a day, compared with
growth of 400,000 a day this year. The 2012 outlook was trimmed
by 200,000 barrels a day.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 413,036
contracts as of 4:26 p.m. in  New York . Volume totaled 540,884
contracts yesterday, 4.5 percent below the three-month average.
Open interest was 1.42 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
