Arizona ’s restriction on abortions
after 20 weeks of pregnancy was challenged by a group of doctors
and the  American Civil Liberties Union  three weeks before the
law is scheduled to take effect.  Three Arizona obstetricians and gynecologists represented
by lawyers for the ACLU and the Center for Reproductive Rights
filed a complaint yesterday in federal court in Phoenix. The law
making abortion after 20 weeks a misdemeanor punishable by as
long as six months’ incarceration violates the Constitution,
they said.  “Under clearly established U.S. Supreme Court precedent,
the State of Arizona cannot ban abortions prior to viability,”
the physicians said. “With its narrowly defined medical-
emergency exception, the ban also unconstitutionally endangers
women’s health.”  The doctors asked the court to rule the ban violates their
patients’ right to due process of law and to bar its
enforcement.  The statute is the most extreme ban in the nation, the ACLU
said in a statement. It would force a physician to wait until a
woman’s high-risk pregnancy deteriorates so far that her life is
at risk or that she faces major medical damage, according to the
statement.  “Arizonans expect their attorney general to vigorously
defend the state’s laws,” Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne
said in an e-mailed statement. “As attorney general, I am
committed to doing that, and this law will be no exception.”  The case is Isaacson v. Horne, 12-01501, U.S. District
Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix).  To contact the reporter on this story:
