A southern Chinese city offered a
1,000-yuan ($157) bounty for every piranha caught after a man
said he was attacked by one of the flesh-eating fish, the Global
Times  reported today .  Officials in Liuzhou distributed free meat and advised
people to fish between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., when the water is
warmest, the newspaper said, citing Lu Zhengxiang, general
secretary of the Liuzhou Fishing Association.  The July 7 attack, in which a man said a piranha bit his
hand, led to speculation that the species was dumped into the
Liujiang River by staff from a local aquarium, the newspaper
said. No piranha have been caught so far, it said.  Any piranha in the river are unlikely to survive winter,
when the water temperature drops below 15 degrees Celsius,
according to the report.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
