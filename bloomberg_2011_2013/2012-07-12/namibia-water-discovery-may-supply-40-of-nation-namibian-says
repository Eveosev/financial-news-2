Fresh water from a newly discovered
aquifer in northern  Namibia  may be vast enough to supply 40
percent of the population for hundreds of years, the Namibian
reported, citing officials.  The discovery of the aquifer about 300 meters (980 feet)
underground from Eenhana to Okongo and stretching from Okankolo
into southern  Angola  was the result of a 5-year project between
the agricultural and water ministry, state-owned Namibia Water
Corp. Ltd. and the German federal institute of geosciences and
natural resources, the Windhoek-based newspaper said today.  “With so much water, you can envisage a much bigger scale
for irrigation, you can take the stress off more industrial
areas, it can make a major change,” project manager and
hydrologist Martin Quigner told the paper. “The more we
drilled, the more fresh water we found.”  Areva SA (AREVA)  opened the southern African country’s first
desalination plant two years ago. Water and power demand has
increased in Namibia following a boom in uranium exploration and
mining.  To contact the reporter on this story:
