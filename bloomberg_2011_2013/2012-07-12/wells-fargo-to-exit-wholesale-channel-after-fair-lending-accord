     July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Wells Fargo & Co., the largest U.S.
mortgage lender, said it will stop funding loans originated and
sold by independent mortgage brokers after settling a federal
fair-lending investigation.  After tomorrow, the company won’t accept new applications
for loans originated by independent mortgage brokers in its
wholesale channel, according to a statement today from the San
Francisco-based firm. The lender said it will still process and
close existing applications.  Wells Fargo agreed today to pay $125 million to settle U.S.
claims that it discriminated against minority borrowers in
making residential loans. The decision to exit wholesale was
made by Wells Fargo “on its own volition,” the bank said in a
statement about that accord.  The company made $7.4 billion of mortgages through brokers
in the first quarter, the most of any lender and 21 percent of
the industrywide total, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a
trade publication. The loans made up about 5 percent of the
company’s total, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
