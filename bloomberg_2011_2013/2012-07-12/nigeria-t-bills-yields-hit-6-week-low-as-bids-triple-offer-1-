Nigerian Treasury bill yields
declined to the lowest in more than six weeks at an auction
yesterday, with bids being made for more than threefold the 95.6
billion naira ($590 million) put on sale.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold 30.159 billion naira of
91-day bills at a yield of 13.75 percent, the Abuja-based
central bank said today in an e-mailed statement, the lowest
since the May 25 sale. The bank sold 65.403 billion naira of
182-day securities at 14.88 percent, also the lowest since May
25,. Bids totalled 290 billion naira.  “We interpret the excess of bids over actual paper sold as
reluctance on the part of government to pay such high rates for
borrowing,”  Alan Cameron , analyst at London-based CSL
Stockbroker Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to questions.
“To the extent that demand was not met at primary auction, we
expect it to appear in the secondary market today, driving down
yields.”  The central bank held the  benchmark interest rate  at 12
percent this year to curb the naira’s decline and combat
inflation, after raising it 5.75 percentage points in 2011.  While  inflation  slowed to 12.7 percent in May from 12.9
percent in April, the rate is set to peak at 14.5 percent in the
third quarter, the highest since April 2010, according to the
central bank.  An additional 21.8 billion naira of 91-day bills and 20
billion naira of 182-day debt were sold to non-competitive
bidders, according to the central bank.  “I think it is fair to assume a certain level of foreign
interest at yesterday’s auction, although they typically prefer
the long end of the treasury bills curve,” Alan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
