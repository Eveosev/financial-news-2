Latvia’s central bank, which pegs
its currency to the euro, cut its benchmark  interest rate  for
the first time since 2010 after the  European Central Bank 
lowered borrowing costs last week.  Latvijas Banka  reduced the refinancing rate to 3 percent
from 3.5 percent, Governor Ilmars Rimsevics told a news
conference today in the capital, Riga. Overnight deposit rates
were cut by 0.15 percentage point to 0.25 percentage point,
while rates on the marginal lending facility were lowered by as
much as five percentage points.  The Baltic country’s  economy , which expanded a revised 6.9
percent from a year earlier in the first quarter, is at risk as
 Europe ’s debt crisis threatens to derail growth. The ECB trimmed
its main rate by 25 basis points to a record-low 0.75 percent on
July 5, citing economic weakness.  Latvia’s borrowing costs were cut as “risks for  price
stability  in the medium term are limited and inflation continues
to slow,” the central bank said in an e-mailed statement. “The
expected negative influence of the  European debt crisis ,” will
also affect the economy.  The yield on Latvia’s dollar bond due 2021 fell 1 basis
point today to 4.67 percent. The cost of insuring government
debt against non-payment for five years using credit-default
swaps rose to 261 basis points from 254, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Inflation eased to 1.9 percent from a year earlier last
month, the slowest pace in 20 months as energy costs fell. Gross
domestic product will grow 3.5 percent to 4 percent this year,
Rimsevics told reporters, upgrading a previous 1.3 percent
estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
