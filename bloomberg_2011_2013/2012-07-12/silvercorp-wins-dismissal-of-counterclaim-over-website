Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM) , a Canadian
miner of silver in  China , won dismissal of a counterclaim by a
hedge fund that wrote a report posted on a website the company
accused of spreading false information.  New York  State Supreme Court Judge Carol R. Edmead today
rejected Anthion Management LLC’s claim that it was entitled to
damages under state laws designed to protect citizens who
publicly challenge applications by businesses for permits,
leases and licenses.  Anthion, based in New York, argued that Vancouver-based
Silvercorp  sued  the website, Chinastockwatch.com, as part of a
campaign to “retaliate against, intimidate and deter”
criticism of the company.  “Anthion does not seek to expose fraud or wrongdoing for
the public good, and did not publish its attacks on Silvercorp
until after it established a short position in Silvercorp’s
stock,” Edmead wrote.  Silvercorp sued Chinastockwatch.com and Alfredlittle.com
and their operators in September, accusing the sites of
publishing false information to lower the company’s share price
and profit on short sales. In a short sale, an investor sells
borrowed shares, hoping to return them to the lender after
buying the stock back at a lower price.  Anthion in March filed a countersuit identifying itself as
the author of an anonymous report on Silvercorp that was sent to
securities regulators, auditors and journalists and later
published on Chinastockwatch.com.  The case is  Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM)  v. Chinastockwatch.com,
150374/2011, New York State Supreme Court ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
