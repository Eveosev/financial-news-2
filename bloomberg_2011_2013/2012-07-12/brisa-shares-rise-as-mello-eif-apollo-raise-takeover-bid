Brisa-Auto Estradas de Portugal SA 
rose 13 percent in Lisbon trading after Jose de Mello SGPS SA
and Aeif Apollo Sarl raised their bid for  Portugal ’s biggest
highway operator.  The stock  climbed  31 euro cents to 2.65 euros, the biggest
gain since March 30. Brisa shares have gained 4.1 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 1.59 billion euros
($1.94 billion).  Jose de Mello, a holding company for one of Portugal’s
richest families, and Aeif Apollo raised their bid for Brisa to
2.76 euros a share. The bidders, through their Tagus Holdings
Sarl venture, on March 29 had bid 2.66 euros a share.  “It’s natural that the stock will rise toward the price of
the revised offer,” said Francisco Goarmon, a trader at
Probolsa in Lisbon.  Aeif Apollo and Jose de Mello already own a combined  stake 
of 50 percent in Brisa and hold 54 percent of its  voting rights .
Jose de Mello Chairman Vasco de Mello is also Brisa’s chairman
and chief executive officer.  Brisa posted a 5 percent decline in toll revenue last year
as the Portuguese economy contracted. Portugal was the third
country after Ireland and  Greece  to request external aid amid
the sovereign-debt crisis in  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
