KfW IPEX Bank GmbH, the export
finance unit of  Germany ’s state-owned development lender KfW 
Group, and Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg will loan $164.5 million 
to a Turkish wind farm.  The 14-year loan will finance construction of the 120-
megawatt project near Izmir, according to a statement today from
KfW-IPEX, based in  Frankfurt  am Main.  Alto Holding AS is developing the $227 million Karaburun
project, which will generate enough power for 100,000 homes
starting in 2013. Turkey aims to get 30 percent of its power
from renewables by 2023 as it seeks to meet an electricity
demand that’s increasing at about 6 percent annually, Economy
Minister Zafer Caglayan said in June.  KfW IPEX and Stuttgart-based LBBW contributed “in equal
shares” to the syndicated financing. Most of the loan is
guaranteed by German export credit insurance company Euler
Hermes Deutschland AG, according to the statement.  The project will use turbines made by Enercon GmbH, the
Aurich, Germany-based manufacturer. Electricity generated by
renewable sources in  Turkey  is promoted by an off-take price
guaranteed for 10 years, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
