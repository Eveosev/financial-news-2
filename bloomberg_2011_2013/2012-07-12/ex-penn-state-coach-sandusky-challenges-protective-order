Former  Pennsylvania  State University
football coach Jerry Sandusky filed a notice of appeal seeking
to challenge a protective order issued after he was convicted on
state charges of child sexual abuse, according to court records.  Pennsylvania Judge John Cleland erred in his June 26 order
requiring defense lawyers to keep government evidence
confidential and provide the court with an inventory of
materials gathered during the so-called pretrial discovery phase
of Sandusky’s case, Karl Rominger, an attorney for Sandusky said
in the filing.  “The net effect of the court’s order is to invade the
province of attorney work product,” Rominger said papers filed
in state court in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.  The protective order was one-sided and was not reciprocal
upon prosecutors, Rominger said in the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
