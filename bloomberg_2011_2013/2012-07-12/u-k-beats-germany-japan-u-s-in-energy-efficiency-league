The U.K. topped en  energy efficiency 
league of 12 of the largest economies in a study e-mailed today
by a Washington-based non-profit, the American Council for an
Energy-Efficient Economy.  The island nation was followed in the rankings by Germany,
Japan, Italy and  France . Australia, China and the 27-nation
European Union, which includes the U.K., were tied for 6th; the
U.S. came ninth and Brazil, Canada and Russia closed the table.  The council ranked the nations across 27 categories,
covering buildings, transportation, industry and areas of energy
efficiency that cut across all areas of the economy. Categories
included “performance” measures such as energy consumption
relative to economic output, and “policy” metrics such as the
presence of a national energy savings target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
