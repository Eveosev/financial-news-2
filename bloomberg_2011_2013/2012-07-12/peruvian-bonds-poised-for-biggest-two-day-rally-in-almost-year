Peruvian bonds were headed for their
largest two-day gain in 10 months on speculation the domestic
economy will weather Europe’s sovereign-debt turmoil.  The price of the nation’s 7.84 percent sol-denominated bond
due in August 2020 rose 0.45 centimo to 120.32 centimos at 1:22
p.m. in Lima, extending its two-day increase to 1.22 centimos,
the most on a closing basis since Aug. 24. The yield dropped six
basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 4.76 percent.  “Domestic demand for the most part is still quite
resilient,” said  Siobhan Morden , the head of Latin America
fixed-income strategy at Jefferies Group Inc. in  New York .
“There’s a lot of liquidity and it’s got to go somewhere. You’d
rather be in Peruvian or Mexican credit risk than European
credit risk because they offer a growth differential.”  The sol appreciated 0.2 percent to 2.6290 per  U.S. dollar 
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Peru ’s economic activity probably expanded more than 5
percent in May after 4.4 percent growth in April, Banco de
Credito del Peru said in a note e-mailed to clients yesterday.  The Andean country’s economy will expand almost 6 percent
this year, bolstered by domestic demand and a recovery in  China ,
Peru’s central bank President Julio Velarde said in an interview
yesterday in  Shanghai .  Policy makers in Peru will keep their target lending rate
at 4.25 percent for a 14th straight meeting, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists.  The yield on Mexican local-currency bonds due in 2024 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 5.38 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.57
centavo to 141.81 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
