U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary
Clinton  warned that the lack of a region-wide solution to
disputes in the South China Sea could lead to confrontations.  “Issues such as freedom of navigation and lawful
exploitation of maritime resources often involve a wide region,
and approaching them strictly bilaterally could be a recipe for
confusion and even confrontation,” Clinton said in remarks to
Asia-Pacific foreign ministers during a meeting in Phnom Penh,
Cambodia, today.  China has sought to keep the sea disputes off the agenda of
regional meetings, preferring to negotiate with countries
individually. The meeting also included envoys from the 10-
member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, China, India,
Russia, Japan, South Korea, Australia and  New Zealand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
