Events surrounding Bo Xilai, Wang Lijun and Neil Heywood have affected Chongqing municipalityâ€™s
ability to attract investment, China News Agency reported today,
citing Mayor Huang Qifan.  These factors, together with the  European debt crisis  and a
slow U.S. economic recovery, sent the local economy into a
trough in February and March, the  news service  said, citing
Huang. The economy started to rebound in April, and maintained a
steady growth in the first half, it said. Foreign investment in
Chongqing rose 27 percent to $3.7 billion in the first half from
a year ago, CNA said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
