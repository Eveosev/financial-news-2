The U.S. government’s  budget deficit 
widened in June, as spending jumped 9.3 percent from the same
month a year ago.  The deficit expanded 38.7 percent to $59.7 billion from a
$43.1 billion  shortfall  in June 2011, the Treasury Department
said today in Washington. The gap matches the projected $60
billion deficit, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. For the first nine months of this fiscal year the
deficit was 6.8 percent narrower than in the year-earlier
period.  “The  budget deficit  is bad, but it is not as bad as the
June figures suggest,”  Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist
at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  New York , said by e-mail
before today’s report. “July social security benefits went out
early in June due to the July 4 holiday, which boosted outlays,
and next month’s deficit will be underreported as a result.”  Revenue rose by 4.2 percent in June from the same month a
year earlier to $260.2 billion from $249.7 billion, and spending
rose to $319.9 billion from $292.7 billion.  Estimates of the June budget gap ranged from $80 billion to
$37 billion in the Bloomberg survey of 22 economists.  In the first nine months of the fiscal year that began in
October, the budget deficit narrowed to $904.2 billion from
$970.5 billion in the same period last year.  Tax Receipts  Individual income tax receipts in the first nine months of
this fiscal year rose 3.1 percent to $840.5 billion from $814.9
billion in the same period last year. Corporate income tax
receipts rose 31 percent to $175.9 billion from $134.3 billion.  If Congress does nothing on tax cuts championed by former
President  George W. Bush , 82.9 percent of U.S. households would
face tax increases averaging $3,701, according to the  Tax Policy
Center , a nonpartisan research group in Washington. More than 98
percent of households earning more than $50,000 a year would pay
higher taxes.  The  Congressional Budget Office  estimated this week the
June deficit would be $60 billion. The CBO said in a report
dated July 9 that spending was influenced by the shift of
certain payments from July to June.  “If not for those timing shifts, the deficit in June 2012
would have been $19 billion less than the shortfall in June
2011,” the non-partisan CBO said July 9.  To contact the reporters on this story:
