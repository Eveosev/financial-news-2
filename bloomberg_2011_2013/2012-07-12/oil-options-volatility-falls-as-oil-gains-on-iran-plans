Crude-oil options volatility fell as
underlying futures rose after the U.S. announced more sanctions
on  Iran  because of its nuclear program.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 32 percent at 3:25 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 34 percent yesterday.
September options are now more active than August.  Crude oil for September delivery gained 27 cents to settle
at $86.08 a barrel on the Nymex.  Oil rose as the U.S. said it will target Iran’s weapons
proliferation networks and “front companies” helping to evade
international sanctions.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December $117 calls, which fell 2 cents to 62 cents a barrel at
3:37 p.m. with 3,438 lots trading. August $82 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,801 lots changing hands as
they dropped 16 cents to 16 cents a barrel.  Calls accounted for 59 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Puts accounted for 52 percent of the 132,097 contracts
traded in the previous session.  August $80 puts were the most actively traded, with 7,496
lots changing hands. They lost 30 cents to 13 cents a barrel.
The next-most active options, August $90 calls, rose 9 cents to
26 cents on volume of 5,951.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 44,604
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 40,662 lots and
