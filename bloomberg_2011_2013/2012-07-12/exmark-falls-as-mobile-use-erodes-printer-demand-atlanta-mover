Lexmark International Inc. (LXK) , a maker
of laser and inkjet printers, fell the most in more than nine
months after Barclays Capital downgraded the shares, citing a
slump in corporate spending as more workers use mobile devices.  The  stock  fell 7.5 percent to $24.31 at the close in New
York, for the biggest decline since Sept. 22, 2011. Shares of
the Lexington, Kentucky-based company fell 21 percent this year
through yesterday.  “Younger workers may not be printing as much given
different work habits and higher adoption rates of mobile
devices,” said  Benjamin Reitzes , an analyst at Barclays in New
York, in a research report today. He downgraded the shares to
underweight from equalweight and reduced his price estimate to
$24 from $29. “Corporations are more acutely aware of printing
costs,” he added.  Lexmark and its competitors  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  and  Xerox
Corp. (XRX)  are experiencing a slowdown in  sales  of inkjets and entry-
level laser printers as corporate customers reduce the number of
machines they use, Reitzes said. Lexmark’s sales are projected
to slip 4.4 percent to $4 billion this year, according to the
average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
