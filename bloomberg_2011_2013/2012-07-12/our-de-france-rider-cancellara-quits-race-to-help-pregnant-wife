Tour de France rider Fabian
Cancellara, who won the opening prologue, withdrew from the race
to assist his wife who is due to give birth to their second
child in the next few days, his RadioShack-Nissan-Trek team said
in an emailed statement.  Cancellara said being present at the birth was more
important than another Tour stage win, the statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
