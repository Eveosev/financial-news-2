A new tropical depression formed in
the Eastern Pacific about 400 miles (640 kilometers) south-
southwest of the Mexican resort of Manzanillo, according to the
National Hurricane Center.  The depression is moving west-northwest at 7 miles per hour
with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph, the Miami-based agency
said in a  bulletin  at 2 a.m. Pacific time. Some strengthening is
forecast during the next two days and the depression could
become a tropical storm later today, which would make it the
sixth storm of the Pacific season so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
