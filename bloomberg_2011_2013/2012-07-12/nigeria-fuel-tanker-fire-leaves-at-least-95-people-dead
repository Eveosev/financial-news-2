At least 95 people died in  Nigeria 
when a tanker carrying gasoline crashed and caught fire today at
Okobie village in the southern Rivers state, a road safety
official said.  “Villagers were scooping fuel from the fallen tanker when
it caught fire and exploded,” Kayode Olagunju, regional head of
the Federal Road Safety Corps, said today by phone from Port
Harcourt. “The death toll from the fire has risen to 95 with 18
people injured.”  Rescue workers and firefighters are still working to bring
the continuing blaze under control, Olagunju said.  Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer, relies on road haulage
for domestic distribution of fuel amid increasing sabotage of
pipelines by criminal gangs stealing products from the pipelines
to sell, according to the Petroleum Ministry. The West African
country relies on imports for most of its fuel supply due to a
lack of refining capacity.  At least 100 people died when a ruptured gasoline pipeline
caught fire on May 15, 2008 in a suburb of Lagos, the commercial
capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
