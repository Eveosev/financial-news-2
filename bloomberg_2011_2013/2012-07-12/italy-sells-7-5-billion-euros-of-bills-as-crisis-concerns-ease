Italy  sold 7.5 billion euros ($9.16
billion) of Treasury bills as borrowing costs dropped on
optimism European leaders are taking steps toward resolving the
region’s debt crisis.  The Rome-based Treasury sold the 361-day bills at 2.697
percent, down from 3.972 percent at the last sale of similar-
maturity debt on June 13. Investors bid for 1.55 times the
amount of bills offered, down from 1.73 times last month.  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond dropped 4 basis points to
5.7 percent at 11:10 a.m. in  Rome , leaving the difference with
German bunds at 452.6 basis points. A bigger test for the
Italian Treasury comes tomorrow when Italy sells as much as 5.25
billion euros of longer-maturity debt.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  has been lobbying European
partners to agree on a plan to give the the region’s permanent
bailout fund, or ESM, more leeway to buy the bonds of countries
meeting their fiscal goals, such as Italy and  Spain , in order to
lower their borrowing costs.  Monti said this week in Brussels he was confident that
Italy wouldn’t follow Greece, Portugal and Ireland in asking for
a full bailout “though Italy could be interested, as could
other countries,” in tapping the ESM.  To contact the reporter on this story:
