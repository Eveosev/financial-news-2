Ralf Preusser, who heads European
rates research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said Italy was
“the big loser” at the euro summit last month,  Boersen-Zeitung 
reported, citing an interview.  Italy’s main difficulty is its debt burden, at 120 percent
of gross domestic product, not its banking system, as in  Spain ,
the newspaper cited Preusser as saying. He said the European
Union’s decision on a banking union therefore benefits Italy
little and the country’s goal of joint euro-area bonds didn’t
materialize, Boersen reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
