India ’s 10-year bonds gained the
most in three weeks on speculation the central bank will ease
monetary policy to support a slowing economy.  A government report today showed  industrial  output rose 2.4
percent in May from a year earlier, compared with an average
gain of 2.6 percent in the previous 12 months. Inflation
probably accelerated to 7.61 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with 7.55 percent in May, according to a
Bloomberg survey before the data is published next week.  “It’s a question of time before the RBI cuts rates
again,” said Vivek Rajpal, a Mumbai-based fixed-income
strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “The inflation data next
week will be keenly watched by investors.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 declined
four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 8.10 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s
the lowest level since June 25. Nomura predicts the central bank
will cut the repurchase rate by 50 basis points this year.  The  Reserve Bank  of India, which cut its repurchase rate
last quarter for the first time since 2009, will review its
policy on July 31. The monetary authority reduced its  repurchase
rate  by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April, after raising it
by a record 375 basis points through 2010 and 2011. Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao held the repo  rate  at 8 percent at a meeting on
June 18.  The economy expanded 5.3 percent in the three months
through March, the slowest pace in nine years.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, fell 13 basis
points to 7.58 percent, the lowest level in almost a month,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
