The Australian dollar dropped the
most in three weeks against its U.S. counterpart before  China  is
forecast to announce its economic growth slowed last quarter.  The Aussie and  New Zealand ’s dollar fell against the
majority of their 16 most-traded peers as signs global growth is
slowing damped appetite for higher-yielding assets. Data showed
Australian employers cut jobs last month and manufacturing in
New Zealand expanded at a slower pace.  The employment report “brings back on the table the
potential for a rate cut in August,”  Mark McCormick , a currency
strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in  New York , said in
a telephone interview. “You have that coupled with Chinese
growth. If both of those are negative, they could be pretty
strong headwinds against the Australian dollar,”  Australia ’s dollar fell as much as 1.5 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since June 21, to $1.101 yesterday in New York
before trading at $1.0139, down 1.1 percent. The Aussie dropped
0.8 percent to A$1.2036 per euro and tumbled 1.7 percent to
80.41 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar, called the kiwi, weakened 0.9 percent
to 78.94 U.S. cents and slid 1.4 percent to 62.62 yen.  China’s economic growth slowed to an annual 7.7 percent
last quarter, from 8.1 percent in the previous three months, a
Bloomberg survey forecast before the data is released today.
China is Australia’s biggest trading partner.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia will keep its overnight
cash-rate target at 3.5 percent at its Aug. 7 policy meeting,
according to the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey.  The number of people employed in Australia fell by 27,000
in June, the statistics bureau said in Sydney yesterday. That
compared with the median estimate of no change in employment in
a Bloomberg News survey of economists. The  jobless rate  rose to
5.2 percent from 5.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
