Serbia ’s central bank will shift to
direct repurchase operations on July 18 to address a liquidity
strain sparked by policy-tightening measures introduced in June.  “In line with previous announcements and the current
liquidity situation, the Executive Board of the National Bank of
Serbia has decided to set repo operations instead of reverse
repo operations as its main policy tool,” Vice-Governor Bojan
Markovic told Bloomberg by phone today.  The central bank raised today its main interest rate by a
quarter-point to 10.25 percent, the second increase in two
months following a 50 basis point boost on June 7. It also
tightened reserve requirement rules to drain liquidity from the
market amid the government’s fiscal expansion and depreciation
pressures on the dinar.  Since it started inflation targeting in August 2006, the
central bank has used reverse repo operations to drain excess
liquidity as high  interest rates  attracted both domestic and
foreign investors to park their funds with the Belgrade-based
Narodna Banka Srbije.  The decision will be published in the Official Gazette by
early next week allowing the bank to implement the change in its
main policy tool, Markovic said, adding the bank will take
excess liquidity from banks only occasionally in the future via
“fine-tuning” operations.  The new repo operations will be conducted at a multiple
price, offering banks a limited amount of cash with the
benchmark two-week repurchase rate serving as the minimum price,
he said. The central bank will take dinar-denominated Treasury
bills and bonds as collateral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
