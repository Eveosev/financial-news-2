Tim Participacoes SA (TIMP3)  dropped the
most in almost a year after a newspaper reported the company may
be blocked from selling mobile plans to new subscribers if
 service  doesn’t improve.  Brazil’s second-biggest cell-phone operator declined 7.5
percent to 9.80 reais in Sao Paulo, the biggest one-day loss
since August 2011. It was the worst performance on the Bovespa
index, which slid 0.3 percent.  Brazil Communications Minister  Paulo Bernardo  said Tim may
be prevented from selling new contracts if it fails to improve
operations as complaints mount, O Estado S. Paulo reported.
Bernardo said Tim may be required to sign an agreement with
regulators pledging better service, the newspaper said.  “Paulo Bernardo’s remarks were pretty strong and spurred
concern that the company may lose market share,”  Pedro Galdi ,
chief strategist at Sao Paulo-based brokerage SLW Corretora,
said in a phone interview.  Tim said in a statement e-mailed to Bloomberg News that the
company isn’t aware of the need to sign any document with the
regulator and that it’s open to discussing with the government
“deficiencies an operator is susceptible to” if so required.
An official at the Communications Ministry didn’t return a phone
call seeking comment.  Telefonica Brasil SA, whose Vivo unit is Brazil’s biggest
wireless carrier, declined 2.2 percent to 49.51 reais.  Tim rallied 15 percent this year through yesterday, while
the Bovespa fell 5.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
