Exports of North Sea Flotta crude
will increase to two cargoes of 650,000 barrels each in August,
according to a loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News.  This compares with one 600,000-barrel shipment in July.  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  operates the field. Loading programs
are monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by field
operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and
trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
