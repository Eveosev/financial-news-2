Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC)  said work
crews can begin to connect lines blocked by a train derailment
in Columbus,  Ohio , yesterday after clearing ethanol rail cars
from the site.  When full train traffic can begin again isn’t yet clear,
the railroad said in an e-mailed statement. Workers have laid
200 feet of track to replace damaged portions, Norfolk Southern
said.  Three ethanol cars and one car hauling wheat burst into
flames after seventeen of 98 cars in a mixed freight train
derailed early yesterday. The “smoldering fire” that resulted
was extinguished at 2:45 a.m. today, the company said.  Two cars have been re-railed, 10 are in a storage area and
another five cars have been cleared from the tracks and remain
at the derailment site.  The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board gave Norfolk
Southern, the second-largest railroad in the eastern U.S.,
permission to begin clearing the derailment site at 6:30 p.m.
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
