Time magazine created a stir in India this week by putting India's prime minister,  Manmohan Singh , on the cover of its  Asian edition , calling him "The Underachiever." Locked behind a subscription wall, the article itself was hard to access, but this had the paradoxical effect of allowing every critic of India's beleaguered prime minister to project his or own civic and economic discontents onto the provocative cover line, whether anger over rising prices and  corruption , distress over a  slowing economy , annoyance at red tape and  paralysis in government  and cronyism in business, impatience with some of the  more disruptive  partners in the coalition government, or annoyance at Singh's apparent lack of power within his own party, the Indian National Congress. The cover provided a single point of focus for discussion in the Indian print media -- and even more, prominently, on television, with its love of a good story generated at no cost and its two- and three-minute rhetorical wars -- and allowed every Indian news website to recycle the question in its own Internet polls. It's hard for this writer, at least, to judge the prime minister as harshly as some critics, if for no other reason than the fact that he shares power with -- or perhaps more accurately devolves those powers to -- two other figures in his party who enjoy comparable influence, but without much accountability. These are the president of the Congress Party,  Sonia Gandhi , who in 2004 installed Singh as prime minister after the Congress surprisingly emerged as the single largest party in the general elections of that year, and her son  Rahul Gandhi , presently a general secretary in the party and very likely the party's candidate for prime minister in the next general election in 2014. Singh labors, that is, under the weight of a party that has fallen into a state of decadence, a shadow of the organization that, led by  Mahatma Gandhi  and  Jawaharlal Nehru , orchestrated the Indian struggle for independence, put its faith in democracy, crafted the excellent constitution of the new Indian state, and enjoyed power for almost three decades before being voted out for the first time. What holds the party together today is also what ails it: an emasculating dependence on a figurehead, or heads, that has crystallized over time (like the  practice of caste ) into a perverse and damaging tradition, one that leans toward the safety and suffocation of a predestined order over the ferment and disruption of a genuinely democratic framework.  Nehru , India's first and to date perhaps most distinguished prime minister, could never have imagined when he was president of the Congress Party that control of the organization would pass down after him to his daughter,  Indira Gandhi  (no relation to Mahatma Gandhi), and then after her sudden assassination to her son,  Rajiv Gandhi  -- and then, a few years after Rajiv's own assassination, to his wife, Sonia -- and thereon, presumably, to Rahul, the son of Rajiv and Sonia. The youngest Gandhi  has now spent several years  trying to finesse the contradictions involved in making the party more " meritocratic " from a position of power he enjoys mainly because of his last name. His main attraction, in a parliament packed with geriatrics, is said to be his youth (he is in his early 40s, and currently head of the Indian Youth Congress). But it should be emphasized that this refreshing attribute, said to be positively co-related to idealism, is actually one he shares with a few hundred million Indians, who are sure to be offered none of the privileges he enjoys. Partly by chance and partly from sloth, the Congress Party has perfected a model, now widely replicated in Indian politics, of a party that is democratic on the outside and dynastic on the inside -- a kind of democratic feudalism that has also mushroomed in other parts of south  Asia , such as  Pakistan  with its Bhutto dynasty. Thus it has come to be that every congressman, when he or she wakes up, expects to see the sun rising in the east -- and, lower down, a Gandhi at the head of the party (and with figures like Singh, then, serving as worker bees for the larger cause of continuity). Always slightly left of center, the party's historic commitment (often rightly criticized for its excesses) to socialism, moderated somewhat by its  acceptance in 1991  that the Indian economy was in need of deregulation, has come to seem in the current term as no more than a cynical investment of taxpayers' money into grand redistributive schemes that farm out enough freebies to ensure a return to power in 2014. In some quarters -- including in Singh's own view, as expressed in an interview this week in the  Hindustan Times  -- this is labelled "the healing touch," but without a commitment to fiscal prudence and economic reform it seems more like a kind of complacent paternalism, one that mirrors the current maternalism of the president of the Congress Party. (There is an essay waiting to be written on parenthood as the model for the relationship between the Indian politician and the Indian voter.) As an economist -- and as of last month also the  finance minister  -- Singh's failure to balance the books is acutely provoking to his critics, and perhaps acutely embarrassing to the prime minister himself. Even so, Singh has left himself open to criticism by his own dependence on the party high command. Uniquely among Indian prime ministers, he  has never won an election  to the lower house of Parliament, the Lok Sabha. The Time magazine cover and the reaction to it in  India  produced a bit of inspired satire from the Wall Street Journal's Paul Beckett, who wrote in a  mock "report,''  one that poked fun not only at the Congress but also at the persistent Indian tendency to see the conspiracy of a "foreign hand" in any criticism of the country: And on the website Project Syndicate, the Indian economists Jagdish Bhagwati and Arvind Panagriya wrote, in " The Bell Tolls For India's Congress Party ": Singh, meanwhile, defended his government's record, and asserted in a  long interview  in the Hindustan Times that things were not as bleak economically as the prevailing sentiment suggested: We might end by moving from history, politics and economics into the realm of art, and the Indian poet Rabindra Swain's recent poem " The Prime Minister ." Swain interprets the dilemma of the prime minister through the lens of Hindu mythology, and the legend of the god  Shiva , whose throat turns blue after he drinks the poison churned up by a battle between the gods and the demons, in order that the world be saved from devastation. "In the Prime Minister is the triumph," writes Swain, channeling a famous image from the  Upanishads , "Of the bird who himself does not eat/But watches the other one take tiny pecks." It is the triumph, that is, of virtue and self-restraint, the kind that would befit a sage or a renunciate -- but not a politician.
