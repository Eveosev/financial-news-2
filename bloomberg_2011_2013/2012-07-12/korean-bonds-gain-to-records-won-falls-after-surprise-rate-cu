South Korea ’s government bonds
jumped, pushing yields to record lows, and the won fell as the
central bank unexpectedly cut borrowing costs for the first time
in more than three years.  Only two out of 16 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg News
predicted a rate reduction, while the rest expected no change.
Governor Kim Choong Soo and his board lowered the benchmark
seven-day repurchase rate to 3 percent from 3.25 percent, the
first decrease since February 2009, according to a statement in
Seoul today. The won dropped the most in almost two months as
the  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of shares lost 2.2 percent.  “Today’s cut signals the growth data for the second
quarter, which haven’t been released yet, may be worse than
expected, making the BOK take preemptive action,” said Ryan Oh,
a Seoul-based fixed-income analyst at Samsung Securities Co.
“Investors may now look forward to another cut this year.”  The yield on 3.5 percent bonds due March 2017 slid 25 basis
points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 3.08 percent in  Seoul ,
Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. That is the lowest level since
Bloomberg started compiling Korean bond rates in 2000. Ten-year
yields declined 21 basis points to an all-time low of 3.31
percent. Three-year debt futures jumped 0.69 to 105.75 and the
one-year interest-rate swap fell 31 basis points to 2.94
percent.  Won Falls  The won touched a two-week low as data showed Australian
employers unexpectedly reduced payrolls in June and the jobless
rate rose for a second month, adding to concern the global
economy is slowing.  The currency fell 0.9 percent to 1,151.38 per dollar in the
biggest decline since May 16, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. It earlier touched 1,151.40, the weakest level since
June 29. The currency’s one-month implied volatility, a measure
of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 16 basis
points to 7.52 percent.  “The BOK’s rate cut, combined with  Australia ’s negative
job data, heightened  risk aversion  in the market,” said Ryoo Hyun Jung, a Seoul-based chief currency dealer at Citibank Korea
Inc. “Reaction in the won market after the rate decision was
bigger than expected, and I don’t think the lowering is
something that would trigger capital outflow from South Korea.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
