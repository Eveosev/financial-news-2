Rapeseed yields in  France ’s
northeast are “very good” for the first harvested plots,
oilseed researcher Cetiom reported.  Harvesting has started in most areas south of the eastern
city of Dijon, the Paris-based researcher wrote in an online
 report  today. In those regions, where crops suffered little
frost damage, indications are for yields of 3 metric tons to
more than 4.5 tons per hectare (2.47 acres), Cetiom said.  “The first results we’re getting back are very positive,”
Cetiom wrote. “It’s still much too early to point to a general
trend. Plots with problems, still not mature, as well as areas
with significant frost damage will temper these very good first
numbers.”  France is the European Union’s largest rapeseed grower.
Crops in the northeast of the country were damaged by frost in
February, and the  Agriculture Ministry  has forecast average
rapeseed yields in France will decline to 3.23 tons per hectare
from 3.45 tons in 2011.  In the Val-de-Saone region, average yields are about 5 tons
per hectare, while first results in the Yonne region are about 4
to 4.2 tons per hectare, according to Cetiom.  Rainy and cool weather is interrupting the harvest, the
researcher reported. Fields that suffered most frost damage are
often “invaded” by abundant weeds including geraniums,
poppies, grasses and thistles, and farmers won’t be able to
harvest part or all of some plots, Cetiom wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
