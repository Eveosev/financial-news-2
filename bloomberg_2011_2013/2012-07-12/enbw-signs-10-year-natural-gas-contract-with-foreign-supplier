EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK) ,
Germany’s third-largest power supplier, signed a 10-year gas
contract with an unindentifed foreign gas producer with a value
of 600 million ($730 million) euros a year.  The contract, which covers about a third of EnBW’s gas
requirements, will start in October, Germany’s third-largest
utility said in a statement today.  “The long-term delivery contract with a big volume hedges
EnBW against imponderables in gas supply,” EnBW Chief Executive
Officer Hans-Peter Villis said in the statement. The deal
“considerably” improves the company’s gas-supply situation, he
said.  EON AG (EOAN)  and  RWE AG (RWE) , Germany’s two biggest utilities, have
lost hundreds of millions of euros on long-term gas contracts as
the price they could charge customers slipped below the oil-
price linked rates they were paying suppliers. While RWE is
still negotiating new terms with  OAO Gazprom (GAZP) , EON reached an
agreement with Russia’s export monopoly on July 3.  EnBW’s contract reflects the increased importance of
wholesale markets for the pricing of gas, according to the
company’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
