Pennsylvania is offering $2.25
million in aid to Scranton, the city that paid workers minimum
wages amid a cash crunch, to spur elected officials there to
agree on a long-term fiscal recovery plan.  C. Alan Walker, secretary of the Community and Economic
Development Department, in a letter today offered a $2 million
no-interest loan plus a $250,000 grant to help cover current
expenses if the City Council and mayor agree on a revised rescue
plan by Aug. 1 and adopt it by Aug. 15.  Mayor Christopher Doherty and the council have disagreed on
how to resolve the city’s financial plight. He said that kept
him from borrowing to cover immediate cash needs and led to the
minimum-wage payments he imposed last week, in defiance of a
court order. The move prompted lawsuits from worker groups who
claimed in federal court that it violated U.S. law.  “We’re giving them one last chance to come to a consensus
on a recovery plan,” Steven Kratz, a Walker spokesman, said by
telephone.  Walker also offered the services of a mediator to help
broker a deal in the city, which has been in a state program for
distressed municipalities since 1992. Scranton faces a $16
million shortfall on a budget of $85.3 million for this year,
Doherty said.  Tax Increase  The mayor has proposed a 78 percent property-tax increase
over three years to right its finances, a plan that Council
President Janet Evans said would “cause blight and flight,” in
a July 10 telephone interview. She didn’t immediately respond to
a telephone call for comment on Walker’s letter.  “Hopefully it’s an incentive to get a plan passed and
approved,” Doherty said by telephone about the offer. The mayor
said he hasn’t decided whether to provide workers with their
full earnings when paychecks go out next on July 20.  “We’ll see how the money comes in,” he said. Each pay
cycle usually costs the city about $1 million, according to
Gerald Cross, executive director of the Pennsylvania Economy
League, the state-appointed consultant to Scranton.  The city of about 76,000, where 19 percent of residents
live in poverty compared with 12 percent statewide, is about 125
miles (200 kilometers) north of Philadelphia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
