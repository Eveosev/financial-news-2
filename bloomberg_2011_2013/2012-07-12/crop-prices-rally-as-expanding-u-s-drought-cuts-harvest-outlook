Corn and soybeans rose for the first
time in three days as an expanding drought in the U.S. Midwest
increased the chances that yield losses will exceed government
forecasts. Wheat also rallied.  Most of the Midwest will get less than 20 percent of normal
rain in the next five days, and temperatures will rise above 100
degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius) in the four days ending
July 18, according to  T-storm Weather LLC . As much as 51 percent
of the region got less than 25 percent of average rain in the
past 14 days. The ratings of the corn and soybean crops are the
lowest since 1988, government data show.  “The warmer temperatures will increase yield losses for
corn and raise the risks for soybeans,” Ron Mortensen, the
president of Advantage Ag Strategies Ltd. in Fort Dodge,  Iowa ,
said in a telephone interview. “Soil moisture is empty, and you
can see the crops declining daily. Crops will get smaller
without a dramatic increase in rain in the next two weeks.”  Corn futures for December delivery advanced 4 percent to
close at $7.3225 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. The price has jumped 44 percent since June 15, reaching
$7.48 yesterday, the highest for a most-active contract since
Sept. 13.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$15.29 a bushel. Yesterday, the oilseed reached $15.75, the
highest since July 2008.  Wheat futures for September delivery gained 2.5 percent to
$8.4675 a bushel, the third gain this week. Earlier, the price
reached $8.58, the highest since April 2011.  Yesterday, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  cut its
outlook for domestic corn output by 12 percent, a month after
predicting a record harvest. The U.S. soybean crop will be the
smallest in four years, and global wheat production will be 1
percent less than forecast in June, the agency said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $14.4 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
