Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
urged Chinese Foreign Minister  Yang Jiechi  to engage in dialogue
with the Dalai Lama, according to a U.S. official who wasnâ€™t
authorized to speak on the record.  Clinton met Yang before a regional security meeting today
in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. U.S.-China relations were strained
after President Barack Obama met with the Dalai Lama in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
