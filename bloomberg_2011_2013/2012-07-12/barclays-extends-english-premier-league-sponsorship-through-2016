Barclays Plc (BARC)  agreed to a three-year,
120 million-pound ($185 million) renewal of its title
sponsorship of the English Premier League, soccer’s richest
national championship.  The agreement runs from the 2013-14 through 2015-16
seasons, the Premier League and Barclays said in a joint
statement. The previous sponsorship extension in 2009 between
the two was worth 82.25 million pounds.  The 20-team Premier League last month agreed on a three-
year domestic TV contract worth a record 3.02 billion pounds
through 2016. Its global television rights were sold for 1.4
billion pounds.  The league was broadcast in 212 territories to more than
650 million homes and an audience of 4.7 billion people last
season, according to the statement. Total attendance was more
than 13.4 million fans with a stadium capacity rate of 92
percent for the third straight season  The Premier League was formed in 1992. It was sponsored by
Barclaycard from 2001 to 2004, when it was changed to Barclays.  Robert Diamond  stepped down last week as chief executive of
Barclays, Britain’s second-biggest bank by assets, after it
admitted rigging a key interest rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
