Gulf Coast  gasoline strengthened to
the highest level in a week after the Phillips 66 Sweeny
refinery in Texas conducted repairs.  The 247,000-barrel-a-day plant reported emissions from a
coker and fluid catalytic cracker No. 3, according to a filing
with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The
maintenance event began yesterday at 6:22 a.m. local time and
lasted until 11:22 a.m. today, the company said.  The premium for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline, or RBOB,
in the Gulf Coast rose 1.25 cents to 2.75 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:16
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the
highest level since July 5. Prompt delivery gained 1.73 cents to
$2.8012 a gallon.  Inventories of RBOB at the hub increased 6.8 percent last
week to 10 million barrels, government data showed. That’s 12
percent lower than a year earlier.  Rich Johnson , a Phillips 66 spokesman, didn’t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment on Sweeny plant operations.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago strengthened a
second day, gaining 3 cents to a 10-cent discount.  Husky Energy Inc.’s Lima,  Ohio , refinery plans to shut its
selective catalytic reduction system for 10 days starting July
16 for maintenance, Dina Pierce, a spokeswoman for the Ohio
Environmental Protection Agency, said yesterday.  The work involves the isocracker and ultraformer furnaces,
Pierce, based in Columbus, Ohio, said in a telephone interview.  Production won’t be affected, Mel Duvall, a Calgary-based
spokesman for Husky, said in an e-mailed statement the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
