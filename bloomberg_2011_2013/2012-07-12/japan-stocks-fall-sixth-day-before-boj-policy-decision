     July 12 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell for a sixth day,
with the  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  extending its longest losing
streak since April, on speculation the  Bank of Japan  will
refrain from boosting stimulus at its policy meeting today.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender,
fell 1.6 percent. Asahi Glass Co. dropped 6.6 percent after
cutting its operating profit forecast.  Tokyo Electric  headed
toward a record low on a report its reactor cleanup will cost 1
trillion yen ($12.6 billion). Best Denki Co. surged 15 percent
on a report Yamada Denki Co. will acquire the electronics
retailer.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1 percent to 8,765.38 at
the 11:30 a.m. trading break in Tokyo. Trading volume on the
Nikkei was 5 percent above the 30-day average. The broader Topix
Index lost 0.9 percent to 750.15, with about three stocks
falling for each that rose.  “When you look at domestic economic conditions, you see
few reasons to expect a move out of the BOJ,” said Takahiro Nakano, a Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho Trust &
Banking Co., a unit of  Japan ’s third-largest bank by market
value. “Yet there are still lingering expectations for more
easing this time. The market hasn’t reached its consensus, and
that’s why people are wavering.”  The Topix  rebounded  about 8 percent since June 4, when it
closed at its lowest since 1983, after euro leaders agreed to
ease bailouts for lenders and on optimism central banks around
the world will ease policy.  The gain has boosted the average price of shares on the
Japanese gauge to 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.1 times
for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4 times for the Europe
Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  Stimulus Hints  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.1 percent
today. The equity gauge closed little changed in  New York 
yesterday, erasing losses in the final hour of trading as
investors sifted through minutes of a Federal Reserve meeting
for hints of additional stimulus.  Ten of 17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News expect no
change to the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy today after
sentiment among large manufacturers improved last quarter,
according to the Tankan survey released last week.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 5.5 percent to 19.84,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.7 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
