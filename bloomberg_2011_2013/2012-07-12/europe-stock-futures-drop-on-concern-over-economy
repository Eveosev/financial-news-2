European stocks  declined the most in
more than two weeks as minutes released by the  Federal Reserve 
disappointed investors seeking a more definitive signal for
further quantitative-easing measures.  Temenos Group AG plunged 28 percent to a three-year low
after reducing its estimate for 2012 revenue growth and saying
its chief executive officer quit.  Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM)  dropped 6.7
percent after the  fund manager  reported a drop in assets. Aegis
Group Plc surged 45 percent, the most in 21 years, after Japan’s
Dentsu Inc. agreed to buy the company.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  fell 1.1 percent to 252.89 at
the close in London, the biggest retreat since June 25. The
benchmark measure has retreated 0.6 percent this week, after a
five-week rally, as concern mounted the slowing economic growth
will curb earnings in the U.S. and  Europe .  “It was clear that the Fed would not take any actions
because they already have the Operation Twist program,” said
Andreas Lipkow, an equity trader at MWB Fairtrade
Wertpapierhandelsbank AG in Frankfurt. “Some market
participants hoped that the Fed would give some signals for
further actions.”  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said on June 20 it will
expand Operation Twist to extend the maturities of assets on its
balance sheet, and it stands ready to take further action as
needed.  Stimulus Debate  Officials debated the need for further stimulus measures at
last month’s meeting, minutes released yesterday in  Washington 
showed. Two participants supported additional bond purchases,
while two others said only a further deterioration in the
economy would warrant them.  FOMC members said strains in global markets stemming from
the euro-area debt crisis had increased since their April
meeting, and that “U.S. fiscal policy would be more
contractionary than anticipated.”  “The markets are getting more and more short-lived in
terms of their positive reaction to stimulus,” said Andreas Utermann, Frankfurt-based global chief investment officer at
Allianz Global Investors, which overseas about $349 billion. “I
think the Fed will wait until at least September to see further
confirmation of a slowdown,” he said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move” with  Francine Lacqua .  National benchmark indexes fell in 16 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 dropped 1 percent.
France’s CAC 40 slid 0.7 percent and Germany’s DAX retreated 0.5
percent.  Jobless Claims  U.S.  applications for jobless benefits  decreased by 26,000
in the week ended July 7 to 350,000, the fewest since March
2008, Labor Department figures showed today. Economists had
forecast 372,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  In  China , banks extended 919.8 billion  yuan  ($144.3
billion) of local-currency loans in June, the People’s Bank of
China said today. That compares with the 880 billion-yuan median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and 793.2 billion yuan in
May.  Temenos (TEMN)  declined 28 percent to 10.25 Swiss francs, the
lowest price and the biggest decrease since the first quarter of
2009, after reducing its forecast for 2012 revenue growth to a
range of minus 5 percent to plus 1 percent, compared with an
earlier forecast of minus 5 percent to plus 6 percent. The
company also said CEO Guy Dubois will step down for personal
reasons and be replaced by David Arnott, who’s currently the
chief financial officer.  Temenos Downgrades  Temenos shares were cut to underperform, the equivalent of
sell, at Bank of America Corp., to neutral at Helvea AG and to
sell at Bankhaus Metzler. All of them had a buy rating on the
equity earlier. Vontobel Holding AG and Exane BNP Paribas cut
their price targets for the stock.  Cap Gemini SA (CAP) , France’s biggest computer-services company,
declined 2.9 percent to 26.23 euros.  Infosys Ltd. (INFY) , India’s second-biggest software exporter, cut
its sales forecast and reported fiscal first-quarter profit that
missed estimates.  Ashmore tumbled 6.7 percent to 307.8 pence, the lowest
since October. The U.K. fund manager said assets under
management fell 3.3 percent to $63.7 billion in the fourth
quarter.  A gauge of mining companies fell 2.8 percent for the worst
performance among the 19  industry groups  on the Stoxx 600. Rio
Tinto Group, the world’s third-biggest mining company, dropped
3.5 percent to 2,926 pence. Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott
will retire at the end of next year, the company said.  BHP Drops  BHP Billiton , the world’s largest mining company, lost 3.3
percent to 1,751 pence. The stock was cut to neutral from
outperform at Credit Suisse Group AG.  Telecom Italia SpA (TIT)  led telecommunication stocks lower,
sliding 6.5 percent to 70.2 euro cents. Revenue growth from
 Latin America  is poised to slow to 2.7 percent in 2013 from 12
percent last year, according to an estimate by Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co.  G4S Plc (GFS) , the world’s largest security-guard supplier, fell
2.6 percent to 283 pence after after Britain had to call in the
military to beef up the company’s efforts to staff London’s
Olympic Games in two week’s time. G4S said it’s is experiencing
“some delays” in vetting and accrediting the thousands of
extra guards needed.  Aegis Group surged 45 percent to 235.3 pence, the biggest

to 237.5 pence, erasing an earlier gain of as much as 16
percent.  SAP AG (SAP)  advanced 2.7 percent to 47.50 euros, erasing earlier
