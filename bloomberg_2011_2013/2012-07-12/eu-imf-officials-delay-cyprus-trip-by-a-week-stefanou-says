Officials from the European Union
and the  International Monetary Fund  delayed a trip to Cyprus by
a week to July 22, government spokesman  Stefanos Stefanou  said.  Cyprus last month became the fifth of the euro area’s 17
states to seek a financial lifeline, while also pursuing a 5
billion-euro ($6.1 billion) loan from Russia. The Cypriot
government needs emergency aid to refinance debt rather than to
fill new budget holes, Finance Minister Vassos Shiarly said on
July 6.  The decision to push back the visit of the European
Commission, the European Central Bank and IMF officials
evaluating the request from Cyprus was made “because they’re
not yet ready with their evaluation” from a preliminary, fact-
finding trip, Stefanou told reporters in the capital Nicosia
today. The delay “isn’t related to the Russian loan,” he said.  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed on July 6
that Cyprus had requested a loan of 5 billion euros and that the
government was considering it.  “We’ve had no official response” from  Russia , Stefanou
said today.  Stefanou said the Cypriot government hasn’t been informed
if candidates planning to run in the February presidential
election will be required to sign a statement of support for the
bailout agreement when it’s concluded, as Greek party leaders
were made to do.  To contact the reporter on this story:
