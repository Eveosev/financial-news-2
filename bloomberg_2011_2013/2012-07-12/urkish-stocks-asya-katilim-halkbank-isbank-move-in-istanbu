Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell 1.2 percent to 62,324.64 at the close in Istanbul,
declining for a second day and paring its advance this year to
22 percent.  The following shares were active. Stock symbols are in
parentheses.  Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB)  , an Islamic lender,
advanced 3.2 percent, the most since April 25, to 1.91 liras
after Citigroup Inc. upgraded the stock to buy from neutral. The
shares were raised on valuation grounds even though there is
still concern “earnings will remain under pressure in 2012,”
Emre Izgi, an analyst at Citigroup, said in an e-mailed report
today.  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  , a state-run lender, and
 Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISATR)  AS, Turkey’s biggest bank by
assets, fell after Citigroup Inc. downgraded the shares.
Halkbank dropped 1.4 percent to 14.20 liras and Isbank fell 2
percent to 4.83 liras. Halkbank was cut to neutral from buy and
Isbank was cut to sell from neutral, “mainly on valuation
grounds” as Turkish banks have outperformed regional peers, the
report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
