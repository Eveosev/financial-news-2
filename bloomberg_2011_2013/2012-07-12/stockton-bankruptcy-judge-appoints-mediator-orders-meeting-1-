The judge presiding over Stockton,
 California ’s bankruptcy appointed a fellow judge as mediator for
the case and ordered the city and its creditors to meet with her
next month.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Elizabeth L. Perris will hold a
conference on Aug. 30 in  Sacramento  to decide how to organize
the mediation, Judge Christopher Klein said in an order
yesterday.  Stockton filed for bankruptcy June 28 after months of
mediation failed to yield an agreement between the city and its
creditors, including bondholders and labor unions. On the city’s
first day in court last week, Klein said that for the bankruptcy
to be successful the city will need to propose “a consensual
plan of adjustment.”  Perris was named mediator two days after a group of
retirees filed a lawsuit in an effort to stop the city from
cutting off their health benefits.  Before filing for bankruptcy, the city had announced it
would cut retiree benefits to help balance its budget.  The bankruptcy case is In re Stockton, 12-32118, and the
retirees’ lawsuit is In re Stockton 12-02302, both in U.S.
 Bankruptcy Court , Eastern District of California (Sacramento).  To contact the reporter on this story:
