French Productive Recovery Minister
 Arnaud Montebourg  will question  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) ,  Europe ’s
second-biggest carmaker, over its plan to eliminate 14,000 jobs
to ensure that no more positions are cut than needed to save the
company.  Peugeot today said it will shut the Aulnay auto factory,
the first closing of an auto plant in France in 20 years, and
reduce its workforce by 6.7 percent to stem widening operating
losses. The government named an an adviser to examine Peugeot’s
plan.  “Peugeot has a duty to France as a nation,” Montebourg
said on France2 television today. “Job-cut plans can’t be
abusive. They have to be strictly in line with the real needs of
a company.”  The carmaker needs to close the Aulnay factory outside
Paris and eliminate jobs to stop using up about 200 million
euros ($244 million) in cashflow per month and to raise the
utilization rate of its factories, Chief Executive Officer
Philippe Varin said at the same time on French television
station TF1.  “We have to stop the hemorrhaging and that’s why we are
making this decision,” Varin said. “We can’t continue to
operate with half-full plants.”  Peugeot,  Renault SA (RNO)  and  Fiat SpA (F)  this year posted the
biggest declines in car sales in Europe, where Peugeot now
expects the market to contract 8 percent. Moody’s Investors
Service in March was the last of the three main credit-reporting
companies to cut Peugeot’s debt rating to junk.  Peugeot  dropped  1.7 percent to 7.02 euros in Paris trading
today. The stock has plunged 73 percent in the last year, giving
the carmaker a market value of 2.49 billion euros, or 4.3
percent of 2011 revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
