Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.’s
second-largest bank by market value, hired Patrick Lee as head
of origination and client coverage for Singapore, said three
people with knowledge of the matter.  Lee, who previously was Nomura Holdings Inc.’s head of
investment banking for Southeast Asia, will replace Philippe Touati, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the hiring isn’t public. Touati joined Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in April.  Lee declined to comment when reached on his mobile phone
yesterday. Tan Hsueh Mei, a spokeswoman for  Standard Chartered 
in Singapore, also declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
