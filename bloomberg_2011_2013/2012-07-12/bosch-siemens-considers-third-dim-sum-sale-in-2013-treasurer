BSH Bosch und Siemens Hausgeraete
GmbH may sell yuan-denominated bonds in  Hong Kong  for the third
time next year after the Germany appliance maker raised 1.25
billion yuan ($196 million) this week, according to the group’s
treasurer Kai Schrickel.  Bosch-Siemens sold 150 million yuan of 10-year Dim Sum
bonds at 4.375 percent as part of the offering, Schrickel wrote
in an e-mailed reply to questions yesterday. That’s the longest
non-financial corporate offshore yuan-denominated bonds on
record. The company met investors in Hong Kong and Singapore and
informed Taiwanese investors in late June and received
“encouraging” feedback, Schrickel said, adding the proceeds
will be used to fund the company’s business in  China .  “Depending on the market development, we generally can
imagine coming back next year,” said Schrickel.  Bosch-Siemens priced 300 million  yuan  of 2.5-year Dim Sum
bonds at 2.9 percent and 800 million yuan of 5-year bonds at 3.8
percent this week, Schrickel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
