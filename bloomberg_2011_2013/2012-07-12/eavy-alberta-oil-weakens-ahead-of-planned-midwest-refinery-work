Western Canada Select, a heavy oil
blend from  Alberta , weakened ahead of refinery work in the U.S.
Midwest scheduled for later this year.  Refiners in the region will shut almost twice as much
capacity as usual in the fourth quarter, according to IIR
Energy, an energy-information provider. An average of 271,000
barrels a day of the region’s crude-unit capacity will be
offline for maintenance, close to double the five-year average
of 138,000 barrels, the  Sugar Land , Texas-based company said.  Western Canada Select’s discount to West Texas Intermediate
widened $1.50 to $20 a barrel at 12:31 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Syncrude’s discount narrowed 35 cents to $1.15, the
smallest gap since June 15. Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded
from bitumen in Alberta into refinery-ready crude.  Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $5.75 below the U.S.
benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 90 cents to
$15.50 a barrel, the largest since May 9. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
gained $1.25 to $17.50 a barrel over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium increased 90 cents to $10.50 a barrel,
while Southern Green Canyon added 75 cents to $10 above WTI.
Mars Blend added 90 cents to $11.50 a barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 60 cents to
an $14-a-barrel premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
