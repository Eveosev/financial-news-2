Poland ’s central government budget
deficit dropped to less than 21.2 billion zloty ($6.17 billion)
through the first half of the year from 27 billion zloty at the
end of May, PAP newswire reported today, citing Deputy Finance
Minister Hanna Majszczyk.  Revenue from value-added tax, the biggest source of state
income, is running “slightly” below plan and may not meet the
2012 target unless economic growth exceeds government forecasts,
PAP quoted Majszczyk as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
