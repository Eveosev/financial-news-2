Japaul Oil & Maritime Services Plc (JAPAULOI) ,
a Nigerian oil-services company, headed for its biggest decline
in more than three weeks as crude prices retreated.  The stock fell 4.6 percent to 62 kobo as of 1:04 p.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, set for the biggest one-day loss
since June 20.  Oil fell in New York on signs from Asia and the U.S. that
the global recovery is faltering and eroding demand for fuel.
Crude for August delivery declined as much as $1.35 to $84.46 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Japaulâ€™s shares have fallen 31 percent this year, compared
with a 7.3 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
