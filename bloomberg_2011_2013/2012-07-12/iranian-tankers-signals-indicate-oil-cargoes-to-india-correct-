(Corrects tanker’s capacity in second paragraph.)  Two Iranian  oil tankers , part of the
fleet controlled by Tehran-based NITC Co., are proceeding to
India to unload cargoes this month, according to signals from
the ships tracked by  IHS Inc. (IHS)   The Clove, a Suezmax able to haul 1 million barrels of oil,
is scheduled to arrive in the eastern Indian port of
Visakhapatnam July 25, the data showed. The Aframax tanker
Castor, which can hold 600,000 barrels, is signaling to arrive
at the western port of Vadinar July 15. Three more very large
crude carriers are en route to China and a fourth is anchored
outside the Egyptian port of Ain Sukhna.  Iran , under a European Union embargo on oil imports that
began July 1, raised storage on tankers to as much as 42 million
barrels by the end of May, according to the  International Energy
Agency . About 17 VLCCs and eight Suezmaxes belonging to NITC are
storing crude at sea, which equates to about 60 percent of its
fleet, the Paris-based adviser to industrialized countries said
in a report today, citing unidentified shipbrokers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
