The board of  Petroleos Mexicanos ,
the world’s fourth-largest oil producer, approved the company’s
five-year business plan to expand its international presence,
including buying U.S. refineries.  The board of the state-owned company known as Pemex
approved its medium-term plan for 2013 to 2017, Fluvio Ruiz, a
director, said today in a phone interview from  Mexico  City. A
new “internationalization strategy” to buy U.S. refining
assets and join overseas exploration projects was integrated in
the plan, he said.  Pemex is seeking to gain deep-water drilling experience
outside Mexico to reverse seven years of output declines, Ruiz
said. The company is also planning to boost refining capacity by
purchasing a refinery or a stake in the U.S. as asset prices can
be lower than building a new complex.  “The approval of the internationalization strategy will
expedite these kind of projects,” Ruiz said.  Among the plants
available for sale in the U.S. are  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Carson and Texas
City refineries.  Ruiz, who is one of the four independent directors added to
Pemex’s 15-person board in 2009, said May 10 that some of
Pemex’s previous attempts to expand outside Mexico failed
because the company lacked an international strategy. The 5-year
plans are reviewed and updated annually.  To contact the reporter on this story:
