Belmont Stakes winner Union Rags
will miss the remainder of the 2012 racing season with a front
left leg injury.  The 3-year-old colt was checked by a veterinarian after he
galloped two days ago and showed signs of fluid.  “The vet felt it was nothing, but did an ultrasound just
to make sure,” trainer Michael Matz told Blood Horse magazine.
“That’s when we discovered the slight tear in the suspensory.
The prognosis is four to six months off and there should be no
sign of it after that.”  Union Rags has won five of eight career races, giving him
earnings of almost $1.8 million. He placed seventh in the
 Kentucky Derby , skipped the  Preakness Stakes  and won the Belmont,
the final leg of thoroughbred racing’s Triple Crown.  “‘We’re all very disappointed,” Matz said. “This just
came at a bad time. It’s so small you would never be able to
tell there’s anything wrong with him.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
