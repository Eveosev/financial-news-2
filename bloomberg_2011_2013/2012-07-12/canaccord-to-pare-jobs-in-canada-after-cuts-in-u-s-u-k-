Canaccord Financial Inc. (CF)  plans to
pare positions in Canada after cutting 234 jobs in the U.S. and
U.K. on its takeover of British brokerage Collins Stewart
Hawkpoint Plc.  “While we’ve added significant capabilities to our
businesses in the last year, we’re also taking actions to remove
costs from our operations, ensuring more revenue hits our bottom
line,”  Paul Reynolds , Canaccord chief executive officer, said
today at the firm’s annual investors meeting in Toronto. “We’re
committed to managing our business as efficiently as we can in
this operating environment.”  Canaccord, Canada’s largest non-bank brokerage, started
last week by cutting eight advisers and eight support positions
in Montreal, Reynolds said. The Toronto-based firm pared 150
U.K. jobs and about 84 U.S. positions as part of its March
takeover of London-based Collins Stewart Hawkpoint, he said.  Canaccord will disclose details of revenue synergies and
cost savings from the takeover when it reports fiscal first-
quarter results next month, Reynolds said.  The firm’s second quarter will be better than a
“difficult” first period due to benefits of cost-cutting and
fees from advising on large takeovers expected to close by then,
Reynolds said.  Canaccord deals include advising  Viterra Inc. (VT)  on its
takeover by  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , and advising  Extorre
Gold Mines Ltd. (XG)  on its takeover by  Yamana Gold Inc. (YRI) , Reynolds
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
