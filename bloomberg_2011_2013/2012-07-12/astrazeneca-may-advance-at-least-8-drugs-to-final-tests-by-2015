AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  aims to advance at
least eight medicines into late-stage tests within three years,
one of its top research and development executives said today.  “We’ve set our R&D organization a goal of delivering eight
to 11 Phase 3 projects,” Menelas N. Pangalos, executive vice
president of the company’s Innovative Medicine Research Units,
told reporters at a briefing in London.  “That’s more than we’ve ever done and that’s going to make
us more competitive in terms of our peer group,” Pangalos said.  The company also made two announcements on early-stage
research today. AstraZeneca bought a portfolio of potential
nervous-system disorder treatments from Link Medicine Corp., and
said it will participate in an alliance of four academic
laboratories studying a risk factor for  Alzheimer’s disease .  London-based AstraZeneca is the U.K.’s second-biggest
drugmaker.
