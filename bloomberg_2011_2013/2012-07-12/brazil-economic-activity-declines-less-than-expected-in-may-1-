Brazil â€™s economic activity in May
declined less than analysts expected, signaling that interest-
rate cuts and stimulus measures may be having some effect in
offsetting the impact of the global crisis.  The seasonally adjusted  economic activity index , a proxy
for gross domestic product, fell 0.02 percent in May, after
rising a revised 0.10 percent in April, the central bank said.
Analysts expected a decline of 0.4 percent, according to the
median estimate from 26 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The
non-seasonally adjusted index rose 1.09 percent from a year ago,
the biggest increase in four months and also more than expected
by 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median estimate
was for a 0.25 percent increase.  Forecasts for economic growth in the biggest emerging
market after  China  have fallen nine straight weeks to 2.01
percent, according to the latest central bank survey, even as
the government has lowered borrowing costs, cut taxes and
boosted lending by the state development bank. The central bank
has cut the benchmark Selic rate by 4.5 percentage points since
August to a record low 8 percent.  Retail sales  in May fell the most in more than three years,
while industrial output declined for a third month and 3.3
percent from a year before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
