U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
will tell British lawmakers today that his team is undertaking a
“comprehensive audit” of European Union legislation, its
effect on business and its possible overlap with U.K. law, the
Financial Times reported.  An audit proposal was included in the coalition agreement
that linked the  Conservative Party  and the Liberal Democrats to
form the current government and referred explicitly to the EU’s
working-time directive, unpopular with business, the FT said.  The audit won’t be completed until 2014, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
