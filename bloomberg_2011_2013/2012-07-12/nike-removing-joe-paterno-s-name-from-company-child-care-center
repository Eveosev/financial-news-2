Nike Inc. (NKE)  said it will remove the
name of former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno from the
company’s child-care center.  The company’s decision was made after a report by former
Federal Bureau of Investigation director and federal judge  Louis
Freeh  said university officials, including Paterno, failed to
protect children for a decade from sex abuse by former assistant
coach Jerry Sandusky.  “With the findings released today, I have decided to
change the name of our child-care center at our World
Headquarters,” Mark Parker, the company’s president and chief
executive, said in a statement. “My thoughts are with the
victims and the Penn State community.”  Sandusky’s abuse could have been stopped in 1998, Freeh
said in the report, which followed a seven-month investigation.
Paterno, who died in January, was fired in November.  The  Joe Paterno  Child Development Center on the Beaverton,
Oregon, campus of the largest sporting-goods company provides
on-site care for more than 200.  To contact the reporter on this story:
