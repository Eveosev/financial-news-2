The pound fell to its lowest level
in five weeks versus the dollar on concern efforts to pull the
U.K. out of its first double-dip recession since the 1970s will
be hampered by the euro-area crisis and declining global growth.  Sterling slid for a third day against the U.S. currency
after PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said British businesses should
prepare for the possibility of a “prolonged recession” if
 Europe ’s sovereign-debt turmoil worsens. Ten-year yields fell to
the least since June 1 after the U.K. sold bonds maturing in
2022 at a record-low yield.  “Given the situation in Europe, the U.K. recession may not
end until next year, and that is an optimistic scenario,” said
 Lee Hardman , a foreign-exchange strategist at Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in London. “The pound will weaken alongside
the euro, while the dollar is strengthening broadly as  risk
aversion  is creeping back into the market.”  The pound fell 0.5 percent to $1.5417 at 4.30 p.m. London
time after weakening to $1.5394, the lowest level since June 6.
The U.K. currency fell 0.2 percent to 79.06 pence per euro. It
appreciated to 78.71 yesterday, the strongest since Nov. 3,
2008.  The pound may find support at last month’s low of $1.5269
and this year’s low of $1.5235, and later $1.5192, the 61.8
percent Fibonacci retracement of its rally between May 2010 and
April 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low.
Support refers to an area on a price graph where analysts
anticipate orders to buy a security.  Zero Growth  While the U.K. economy will probably show zero growth this
year, risks “are weighted to the downside,” PWC, the London-
based accountancy firm, said in a report today. Britain’s fiscal
watchdog said separately the nation’s public finances are
“clearly unsustainable” and need a tax increase or spending
cut to bring debt down.  Spanish and Italian  government bonds  declined today and
gains in German two-year notes pushed the yield to an all-time
lows.  Sterling has appreciated 3.8 percent in the past year, the
third-best performer after the dollar and the yen among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes.  Britain’s Debt Management Office sold 3.5 billion pounds of
10-year government bonds to yield 1.72 percent, it said today.  U.K. ‘Haven’  The 10-year  gilt  yield fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.54 percent. It dropped to 1.505 percent,
the lowest since June 1, when it reached 1.439 percent, the
least on record. The 4 percent bond due March 2022 rose 0.28, or
2.80 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 122.02.  “The record-low yield shows there is still a haven in the
U.K. bond market,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , a fixed-income
analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London. “The European crisis is
an ongoing feature of that and it will be there for a long
time.”  U.K. debt has returned 3.2 percent this year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds have gained 3.8
percent as U.S. Treasuries handed investors a profit of 2.5
percent.  The U.K. Treasury and Bank of England will announce at 11
a.m. tomorrow details of their so-called Funding for Lending
program to boost credit among the nation’s lenders, the central
bank said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
