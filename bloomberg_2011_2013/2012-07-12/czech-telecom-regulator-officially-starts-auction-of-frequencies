The Czech Republic’s
telecommunication regulator, CTU, officially started an auction
of radio frequencies in the 800 MHz, 1800 MHz, and 2,600 MHz
ranges.  The bidders should apply before Sept. 10 and the regulator
expects to choose a winner before the end of the year, CTU said
at the statement published on its website.  The “transparent’ auction should speed up development of
high-speed mobile broadband services, ensure an effective usage
of frequencies and boost competitiveness on the market by an
entry of a new provider, CTU’s head Pavel Dvorak said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
