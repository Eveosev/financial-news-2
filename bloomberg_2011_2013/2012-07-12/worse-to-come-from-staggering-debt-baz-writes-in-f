Despite five years of fiscal
chastening, the debt load in the 11 economies that have been
most closely watched has risen to a weighted average of 417
percent of gross domestic product from 381 percent in June 2007,
Jamil Baz wrote in the Financial Times.  “In each of  Canada , Germany, Greece, France, Ireland,
 Italy , Japan,  Spain ,  Portugal , the U.K. and the U.S., the ratio
of total (public and private) debt to gross domestic product is
now higher than it was in 2007,” wrote Baz, chief investment
strategist at GLG Partners, part of the Man Group Plc.  With the world “staggering under a mountain of debt,” Baz
made five predictions: with deleveraging not yet begun, the
crisis of the world economy has not started, either; it will
take at least 15 years for the economy to reach “escape
velocity”; the economic impact when real debt-cutting finally
starts “will be massive”-- countries like the U.S. and Japan
“stand to lose more than 20 percent of GDP against trend”;
risky assets will perform badly for a long period.  Baz said the fifth point is that “there is no magic
bullet.” Policy makers in the past could apply various
instruments to ease the impact of debt stabilization measures,
but in an era of low or zero interest rates, “such policy tools
have lost effectiveness.”  “Virtue is not likely to be rewarded for a generation,”
he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
