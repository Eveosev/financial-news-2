Infosys Ltd. (INFO) ,  India ’s second-largest
software exporter, cut its forecast for sales in dollar terms as
it reported profit that missed estimates after customers reduced
spending amid global economic concerns.  Sales in the year ending March 31 may rise to $7.34
billion, Bangalore-based Infosys said in a statement today,
lower than the $7.55 billion forecast in April.  Infosys Co-Chairman S. Gopalakrishnan said in February that
customers “concerned” by the operating environment are
reducing IT budgets and are less likely to spend their entire
allocations. Researcher Gartner Inc. said this month that global
IT spending would grow at a slower pace this year due to the
Eurozone crisis, a slowdown in  China  and a weaker U.S. recovery.  “If you’re not seeing great visibility in the first two
quarters, it is not likely the second half of the year will give
you a big push,” said Vihang Naik, an analyst at MF Global Sify
Securities Pvt. in Mumbai. “Raising the guidance is just highly
unlikely in this macroeconomic scenario.”  Infosys shares plunged 10 percent to 2,234.2 rupees at 9:15
a.m. in Mumbai.  In April, Infosys forecast rupee sales for the year ending
March 31 to be in the range of 384.31 billion rupees and 391.36
billion rupees.  The company had forecast dollar sales for the fiscal year
to be in the range of $7.553 billion and $7.692 billion.
Earnings per American depository share may be in the range of
$3.12 to $3.17, Infosys said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
