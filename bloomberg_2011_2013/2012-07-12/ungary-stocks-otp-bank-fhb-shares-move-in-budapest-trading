The benchmark  BUX (BUX)  index fell 1.9
percent to 16,979.17 by the close in Budapest, retreating for
the first time in four days.  The following were among the most active shares in the
Hungarian market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Magyar Telekom Nyrt. (MTELEKOM HB),  Hungary ’s former phone
monopoly controlled by Deutsche Telekom AG, fell the most in
more than two weeks after announcing that it will increase
prices as a result of “unfavorable economic and market
processes.” The shares declined 2.5 percent to 431 forint.  Mol Nyrt. (MOL)  , Hungary’s largest refiner, fell 2.8
percent to 16,320 forint after Nomura Equity Research cut its
price estimate for the stock by 13 percent on speculation crude
prices will fall. Oil declined as the euro slumped to a two-year
low, reducing investor appetite for raw materials, and on
signals that the global economic recovery is faltering.  OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP)  , Hungary’s largest lender, dropped
1.2 percent to 3,408 forint, a sixth consecutive day of losses.
Emerging-market stocks slid for a seventh day on concern the
global slowdown is worsening as  South Korea  unexpectedly cut its
interest rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
