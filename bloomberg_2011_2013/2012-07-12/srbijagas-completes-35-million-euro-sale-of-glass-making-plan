Srbijagas ,  Serbia ’s state-owned gas
company, completed the sale of Srpska Fabrika Stakla AD, the
country’s only maker of glass packaging, to Glass Industry of
 Bulgaria .  The Bulgarian group agreed in March to buy 64 percent of
the  glass plant  for 35 million euros ($43 million) and invest at
least 22 million euros to upgrade the plant in Paracin, 155
kilometers (96 miles) south of Belgrade, tripling its annual
output to 120,000 tons.  The group of investors includes Pleven, Bulgaria-based
 Rubin JSC , which bought the Serbian plant in 2006 for 100,000
euros and later ceded a majority stake to Srbijagas after the
company racked up 34 million euros of debt for delivered gas.  The Bulgarian investors may reduce the factory’s workforce
of about 1,600, Srbijagas said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
