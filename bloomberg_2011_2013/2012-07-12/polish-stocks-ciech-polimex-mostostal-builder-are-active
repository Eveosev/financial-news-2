Poland’s WIG20 Index lost 3 percent
to 2,153.90 at the close in Warsaw, retreating for a second day.  The following were among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Ciech SA (CIE)   dropped 5 percent to 19 zloty, the lowest
level since June 14, after Parkiet reported Czech billionaire
Zdenek Bakala won’t bid to buy Poland’s second-largest chemicals
maker.  Polimex-Mostostal SA (PXM)  , the country’s second-largest
construction company, declined 7 percent to 0.8 zloty, paring
earlier losses of as much as 10 percent after saying it won a
379 million-zloty ($110 million) building order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
