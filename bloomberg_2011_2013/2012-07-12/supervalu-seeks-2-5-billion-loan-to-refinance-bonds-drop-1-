Supervalu Inc. (SVU) , the third-largest
U.S. grocery that suspended its dividend, is seeking $2.5
billion in loans to refinance debt.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Barclays Plc,  Wells Fargo & Co .,
and US Bank are arranging the financing for the operator of
supermarkets and pharmacies, according to a transcript of
Supervalu’s earnings call yesterday.  The deal for the  Eden Prairie , Minnesota-based company will
consist of a seven-year $850 million  term loan  and a $1.65
billion revolving line of credit maturing in five years, the
company said.  The banks will host a lender meeting tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.
in New York, according to a person with knowledge of the matter,
who asked not to be identified because the information is
private. Michael Siemienas, a spokesman for Supervalu, declined
to comment on the financing.  Supervalu, whose stock sank 49.2 percent to $2.69 in New
York today, saw its $1 billion of 8 percent senior unsecured
bonds due in May 2016 dropped 11.25 cents today, to 90.25 cents
on the dollar at 3:35 p.m. in  New York , according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The notes are yielding 11.2 percent, the most since
they were sold in April 2009.  Credit Swaps  Credit-default swaps tied to Supervalu jumped 6.25
percentage points to 26.5 percent upfront, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  That’s in addition to 5 percent annually, meaning it would
cost $2.65 million initially and $500,000 annually to protect
$10 million of Supervalu’s debt.  Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  Supervalu plans to accelerate price reductions and cut
costs by an additional $250 million over the next two years, it
said in a statement yesterday. The company has retained Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Greenhill & Co. to review its operations.  To contact the reporters on this story:
