Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  of Austria led
Czech shares lower after the U.S. Federal Reserve failed to
signal more quantitative-easing measures to spur growth in the
worldâ€™s largest economy, driving investors from riskier assets.  The stock slid 1.6 percent to 377 koruna by 9:42 a.m. in
 Prague , snapping two days of gains. The 14-member  PX (PX)  index, in
which Erste has a 20 percent weighting, dropped 0.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
