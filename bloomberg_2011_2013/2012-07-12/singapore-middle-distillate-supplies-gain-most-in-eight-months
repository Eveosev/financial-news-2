Middle-distillate inventories in
 Singapore ,  Asia ’s largest oil-trading and storage center, rose
the most in nearly eight months, according to a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore stockpiles including gasoil, or diesel, and
kerosene climbed by 1.17 million barrels, or 15 percent, to 8.96
million in the week ended yesterday,  International Enterprise
Singapore  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the
biggest percentage increase since the week ended Nov. 16.  Residual-fuel inventories, including  fuel oil  and low-
sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, fell by 2.99 million
barrels, or 13 percent, to 20.7 million, the ministry’s data
showed. Supplies were previously the highest since May 2010.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  including naphtha, gasoline
and reformate declined by 1.17 million barrels, or 10 percent,
to 10.2 million, the lowest in five weeks, according to the data.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
