Fewer Americans than forecast filed
first-time claims for unemployment insurance payments last week,
reflecting the volatility of applications during the annual
auto-plant retooling period.  Applications for  jobless benefits  decreased by 26,000 in
the week ended July 7 to 350,000, the fewest since March 2008,
Labor Department figures showed today. Economists forecast
372,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey. Last week’s distortion is likely to unwind slowly
over coming weeks, a Labor Department spokesman said as the data
was released to the press.  Automakers including Chrysler Group LLC,  Ford Motor Co. (F)  and
Nissan Motor Co. are keeping more plants than normal open during
this time of year to fulfill demand and replenish inventories.
For that reason, it may take time to determine if the labor
market is making any progress.  “You can never take claims at face value because of the
July shutdowns,” said  Jonathan Basile , an economist at Credit
Suisse in New York, who projected the number of applications
would drop to 355,000. “We are in a period of uncertainty. This
makes for a situation where businesses will hold off on taking
risks regarding investment and payrolls.”  Prices of imported goods decreased more than forecast in
June as declining energy costs curbed inflation, another Labor
Department report showed. The 2.7 percent plunge in the import-
price  index  was the biggest since December 2008 and followed a
1.2 percent drop in May. Prices excluding fuel fell 0.3 percent,
the most in almost two years.  Futures Fall  Stock-index futures held earlier losses after the reports
on concern the global economy is weakening. The contract on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in September fell 0.8
percent to 1,325.8 at 8:49 a.m. in  New York .  Estimates for first-time claims ranged from 355,000 to
395,000 in the Bloomberg News  survey  of 48 economists. The
Labor Department revised the prior week’s figure to 376,000 from
an initially reported 374,000.  The timing of auto plant shutdowns to retool for the new
model year has been difficult to predict this year, making
adjusting the claims data for these seasonal variations more
challenging, a Labor Department spokesman said as the figures
were released to the press.  Auto Shutdowns  Chrysler announced May 2 three U.S. plants would skip
normally scheduled two-week midyear shutdowns to meet increased
demand. Factories in Detroit and Belvidere,  Illinois , and a
parts factory in Toledo,  Ohio , are staying open. Two more plants
are shutting for one week instead of two, according to  Auburn
Hills , Michigan-based Chrysler.  Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford said May 8 it would boost
production by about 40,000 vehicles by idling 13 plants for one
week instead of two as part of the company’s annual summer
shutdown.  Nissan is also among automakers averting shutdowns. The
Yokohama, Japan-based automaker plans to boost hours, add shifts
or increase payrolls at plants in Tennessee and Mississippi “to
really have the supply catch up with demand,”  Bill Krueger ,
Nissan’s vice chairman of the Americas, said in a July 6
telephone interview.  The Labor Department projected a 28 percent increase in
unadjusted claims last week, or about 103,000. Instead, there
was a 19 percent gain.  The four-week  moving average , a less-volatile measure, fell
to 376,500 last week from 386,250.  Continuing Claims  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
fell by 14,000 in the week ended June 30 to 3.3 million. The
continuing claims figure does not include the number of workers
receiving extended benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and  extended payments  decreased by about
13,300 to 2.65 million in the week ended June 23.  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits
was 2.6 percent in the week ended June 30, today’s report
showed. Thirty-six states and territories reported an increase
in claims, while 16 reported a decrease.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Labor Department figures last week showed that the job
market is making little progress as payrolls expanded by a less-
than-forecast 80,000 in June. Excluding government agencies,
private hiring increased 84,000, the weakest in 10 months.  The unemployment rate held at 8.2 percent to mark the 41st
consecutive month that joblessness has remained above 8 percent
-- the longest stretch of such elevated levels in the post-World
War II era.  To contact the reporters on this story:
