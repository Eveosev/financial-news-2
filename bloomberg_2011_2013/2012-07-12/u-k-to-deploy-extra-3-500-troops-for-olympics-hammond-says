U.K. Defense Secretary Philip Hammond said he authorized the deployment of a further 3,500
troops to guard the London  Olympic Games  after security
contractor  G4S Plc (GFS)  discovered a shortfall in personnel, bringing
the total military guard to 17,000.  “As the venue security exercise has got under way,
concerns have arisen about the ability of G4S to deliver the
required number of guards for all the venues within the
timescales available,” Hammond said in a written statement to
Parliament in London today. “Ministers have been monitoring
this situation and, where necessary, preparing contingency
measures. G4S has now agreed that it would be prudent to deploy
additional military support to provide greater reassurance.”  “The home secretary has therefore requested additional
Ministry of Defense support, and I have authorized the
deployment of a further 3,500 military personnel,” Hammond
said. “This will bring the total number of military personnel,
from all three services and including reservists, contributing
to the safety and security of the games to 17,000.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
