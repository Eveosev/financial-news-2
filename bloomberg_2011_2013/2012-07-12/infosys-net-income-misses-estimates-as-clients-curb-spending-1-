Infosys Ltd. (INFO) ,  India ’s second-largest
software exporter, reported first-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ estimates as customers cut information-technology
spending amid economic uncertainty.  Net income  rose to 22.9 billion rupees in the three months
ended in June, from 17.2 billion rupees a year  earlier ,
Bangalore-based Infosys said today. That compares with the 24.2
billion rupee median of 31 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  Co-chairman S. Gopalakrishnan said in February that
customers “concerned” by the operating environment are
reducing IT budgets and are less likely to spend their entire
allocation. Researcher Gartner Inc. said this month that global
IT spending would grow at a slower pace this year because of the
Eurozone crisis, a slowdown in  China  and a weaker U.S. recovery.  “We’re going to see weaker revenue from Infosys for the
quarter and full year, because of its greater exposure to
consulting work,” said Hitesh Shah, an analyst at IDFC
Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “Spending on consulting is drying up
because of the macro uncertainty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
