owned by  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  and eight bottlers, is acquiring Mexican
dairy producer Santa Clara Mercantil de Pachuca SA. Femsa
tumbled 8.2 percent yesterday, the most in three years, after

sold a portion of their stakes.  Organizacion Soriana SAB (SORIANAB)  , Mexico’s second-
largest retailer, fell 0.2 percent to 40.39 pesos. Shares have
fallen in eight out of the last nine days since July 2 after

its stores to voters before the nation’s July 1 election.  Grupo Pochteca SAB (POCHTECB)   rose 7.5 percent to 3.17
pesos. Antonio del Valle, who invested in a 300 million peso
