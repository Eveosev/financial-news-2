ServiceNow Inc. (NOW)  Chief Executive
Officer Frank Slootman said he may use some of the funds raised
in an initial public offering last month for acquisitions to
expand in  Asia  and  Latin America .  “Professional services companies could really help expand
the capacity of our market,” Slootman said in a telephone
interview today. “The other area is system-management
technology.”  ServiceNow provides software and services to help companies
manage human resources and financial information over the
Internet, using cloud computing. The  stock  surged 37 percent on
its debut trading day on June 29 after pricing above the planned
range. ServiceNow’s initial public offering raised $241.1
million, including an overallotment exercised by the
underwriters.  Slootman said the number of ServiceNow employees has
increased to about 900 from fewer than 300 when he joined the
company last year. He said he expects to hire more employees
this year without specifying a total number.  “We’re constrained by talent,” Slootman said. “We’re not
constrained by resources. It’s a very tight labor pool out
there.”  Slootman also said the company plans to expand its market
share in the public sector by providing services to the  U.S.
Department of Defense .  “We see the public sector as a big area for growth,” he
said.  Shares of the San Diego-based company increased 1.5 percent
to $24.08 at the close in  New York  and have gained 34 percent
since the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
