European Union regulators won’t
draft rules to push down the prices Internet network owners
charge for access to copper lines, the bloc’s telecommunications
chief said today.  EU Digital Agenda Commissioner  Neelie Kroes  said lowering
prices won’t encourage greater investment in faster broadband
networks. Regulators will focus on tougher rules to prevent
network operators from discriminating against rivals for
Internet services, according to a prepared text of a speech.  To contact the reporter on this story:
