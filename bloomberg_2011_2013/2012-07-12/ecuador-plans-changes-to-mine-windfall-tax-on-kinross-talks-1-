Ecuador is planning changes to the
nation’s mining law regulating windfall taxes after contract
talks with Canada’s  Kinross Gold Corp. (K)  stalled, President  Rafael Correa  said today.  “We have to make it more reasonable,” Correa said in
comments broadcast live on state-owned radio station Radio
Publica. “We have the most demanding contracts in the world,
but we have to be very demanding because the opportunities are
enormous.”  Ecuador’s windfall tax, which gives the state 70 percent of
mineral profits above a pre-negotiated base price, is the main
reason Kinross is hesitating to sign a mining contract with the
government to develop its Fruta del Norte gold and silver
deposit in southern Ecuador, Santiago Yepez, head of Ecuador’s
Mining Chamber, said in an interview today.  Fruta del Norte, discovered in 2006, is one of the world’s
biggest gold discoveries, containing 6.7 million ounces of
proven and probable gold reserves and 9 million ounces of proven
and probable silver reserves, according to Kinross’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
