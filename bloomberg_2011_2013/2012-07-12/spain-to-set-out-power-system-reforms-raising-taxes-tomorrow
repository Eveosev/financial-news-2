The Spanish government will set out
the details of its plans to eliminate the shortfall in power-
system revenue following the weekly Cabinet meeting tomorrow,
according to an Industry Ministry official.  The official asked not to be named in line with government
policy.  The government plans to raise taxes to cover power costs
swollen by payments for renewable energy, coal mines, under-
employed gas-fired generators, the Spanish islands and poor
families, Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  said yesterday.  Industry Minister Jose Manuel Soria yesterday said he plans
to impose a progressive tax on power producers so that the
technologies that receive more subsidies contribute more, Europa
Press reported.  The gap between costs and revenue in the government-
controlled power industry has racked up a debt of more than 25
billion euros ($31 billion). The liabilities don’t count on the
government’s books even though they are guaranteed by the state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
