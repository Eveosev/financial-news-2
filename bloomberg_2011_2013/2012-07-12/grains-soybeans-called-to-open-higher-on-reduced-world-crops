What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
 Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures are called to open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel
higher on speculation that hot, dry weather in the next week
will increase U.S. yield losses,  Jerry Gidel , the chief feed-
grain analyst at Rice Dairy LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher
on forecasts that dry U.S. weather will increase stress on
plants as they begin to reproduce, Gidel said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel higher as
reduced crops in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan may increase
export demand for U.S. grain, Gidel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
