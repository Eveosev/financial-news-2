Indian stocks declined the most in
almost six weeks after  Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  posted lower-than-estimated
profit and pared its annual sales forecast as customers curbed
spending on technology amid a global slowdown.  Infosys, the nation’s second-largest software maker, sank
as much as 10 percent, pacing losses among peers.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO) ,
the third-biggest, slumped 4.1 percent and  Tata Consultancy
Services Ltd. (TCS) , which reports earnings today, slid 2 percent. The
three stocks have a combined 14 percent weighting in the
benchmark BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex.  The 30-stock Sensex lost 1.6 percent to 17,218.47,
according to preliminary closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai,
the most since June 1. Sales in the year to March may be at
least $7.34 billion, Infosys said today, less than the $7.55
billion forecast in April. Profit rose to 22.9 billion rupees
($412 million) in the June quarter, missing the 24.2-billion
rupee median of 31 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Equities declined even as data showed  India ’s industrial
output rebounded in May from a contraction after the central
bank lowered interest  rates  earlier in the year. Production at
factories, utilities and mines climbed 2.4 percent from a year
earlier, after a revised 0.9 percent drop in April, government
data showed today. The median of 35 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey was for a 1.8 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
