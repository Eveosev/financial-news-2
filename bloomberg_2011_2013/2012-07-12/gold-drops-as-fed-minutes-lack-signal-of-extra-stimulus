Gold fell to the lowest in almost
two weeks as fewer Americans than forecast filed first-time
claims for unemployment insurance payments last week, easing
pressure on the  Federal Reserve  to loosen monetary policies.  Applications for jobless benefits dropped by 26,000 in the
week ended July 7 to 350,000, the fewest since March 2008, Labor
Department figures showed today. Economists forecast 372,000
claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.
Yesterday, the minutes of the Fed’s June meeting showed policy
makers considered the risk that increased stimulus  might pose.  “Today’s data is further evidence that Fed won’t announce
new measures any time soon,” Steve Scacalossi, a New York-based
vice president at TD Securities Inc., said in an e-mail.  Gold futures for August delivery dropped 0.7 percent to
settle at $1,565.30 an ounce at 1:53 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , after slipping to $1,554.40, the lowest since June 29.  Bullion surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008 to
June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by the precious
metal fell 4.2 metric tons to 2,404.98 tons on July 10, the
biggest decline since May 23, data tracked by Bloomberg showed.  “Physical demand remains lackluster, while ETF holdings
have recently showed some signs of softening,” Credit Suisse
Group AG’s private banking unit said in a report today.  Silver futures for September delivery climbed 0.5 percent
to $27.161 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 1.3 percent to $1,412.50 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery slipped 1.4 percent to
$574.80 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
