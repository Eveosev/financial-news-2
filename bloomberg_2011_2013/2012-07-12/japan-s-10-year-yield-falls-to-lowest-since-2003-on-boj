Japan ’s 10-year note  yield  dropped
to the lowest since 2003 after the central bank unexpectedly
increased its asset-purchase program for a third time this year.  The five-year rate also fell to levels unseen since June
2003 after the  Bank of Japan (8301)  expanded its asset-purchase fund to
45 trillion yen ($564 billion) from 40 trillion yen. Seven of 17
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predicted monetary easing.
The BOJ said it would increase purchases of treasury bills and
remove the minimum bidding yield for the securities.  “Cutting the bidding yield to zero means that the BOJ is
going to buy as many bills as it can from financial companies,”
said  Kazuhiko Sano , the chief strategist at Tokai  Tokyo 
Securities Co., one of 25 primary dealers obliged to bid at
government debt sales. “It’s a positive for short-term notes.
Because of the unexpected step, bonds are being bought.”  The benchmark 10-year yield fell two basis points to 0.765
percent as of 4:32 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Japan Bond
Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt broker. It
was the lowest level since June 2003. The five-year rate
declined one basis point to 0.175 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
