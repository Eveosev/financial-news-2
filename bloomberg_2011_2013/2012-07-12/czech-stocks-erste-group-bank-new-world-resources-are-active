The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
fell 1 percent to 898.30 by 2:35 p.m. in Prague.  The following are among the most active  equities  in the
Czech market today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   dropped 2.2 percent to 374.50
koruna, extending its losses this week to 6.4 percent. Lenders
were among the biggest stock decliners in  Europe  today after the
U.S. Federal Reserve disappointed investors seeking a more
definitive signal for additional quantitative-easing measures in
the world’s largest economy.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, dropped 1.1 percent to 101.84 koruna, set for its
lowest close in two weeks. Europe’s benchmark coal derivatives
slid 0.4 percent to $95.50 a metric ton in the Netherlands, a
fifth day of declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
