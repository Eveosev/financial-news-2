Argentina’s Cordoba province sold
$105.5 million of dollar-linked bonds due in one year to yield
9.5 percent, according to a person involved in the sale.  The provincial government sold the bonds on the domestic
market, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
he isn’t authorized to speak publicly. The province originally
offered $50 million of the bonds, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
