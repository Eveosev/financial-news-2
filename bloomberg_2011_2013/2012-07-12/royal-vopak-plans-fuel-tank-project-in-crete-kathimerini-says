Royal Vopak NV (VPK) , a tank-storage
provider based in the Netherlands, applied via  Greece ’s fast-
track investment program to build fuel-storage tanks in Crete,
 Kathimerini  reported, without citing anyone.  The project, worth as much as 500 million euros ($611
million), would employ 1,500 people during construction and
create 200 permanent jobs on completion, the newspaper said.  Vopak representatives have met with officials in Crete to
discuss the project, which would increase competition in the
island’s fuel market as all existing storage tanks are
controlled either by  Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE)  or by Motor Oil
Hellas SA, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
