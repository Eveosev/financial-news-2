Asian currencies fell, led by  South
Korea ’s won, as the  Bank of Korea  unexpectedly cut borrowing
costs and a Federal Reserve report disappointed investors
looking for a stronger signal for stimulus.  The BOK lowered the seven-day repurchase rate by 25 basis
points to 3 percent, the first cut since February 2009. The
Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia  Dollar Index  snapped a three-day advance
and the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of shares fell for a sixth day
after minutes of the Fed’s June meeting released yesterday said
the central bank will probably need to take more action to boost
the labor market and meet its inflation target.  “The less dovish sounding Fed has helped bring in some
dollar support,” said  Sacha Tihanyi , a strategist at Scotiabank
in  Hong Kong , a unit of Bank of Nova Scotia. The market awaits
China’s growth data and “the risk is for underperformance, at
least the nervousness is there,” he said.  The won weakened 0.9 percent to 1,151.38 per dollar as of
the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Indonesia’s rupiah fell 0.7 percent to 9,488,
Malaysia’s ringgit slipped 0.4 percent to 3.1898 and Thailand’s
baht dropped 0.4 percent to 31.81. The Asia Dollar Index
declined 0.3 percent, with its 60-day historical volatility
holding rising to 3.66 percent from 3.61 percent yesterday.  China’s economy  probably expanded 7.7 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, easing from an 8.1 percent pace in
the first three months this year, according to a Bloomberg
survey. Inbound shipments into Asia’s largest economy increased
6.3 percent in June from a year earlier, compared with a
forecast for an 11 percent gain in a Bloomberg survey.  Bank Indonesia  held its benchmark  interest rate  at 5.75
percent in Jakarta today, as predicted by all 20 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Korean Rate Cut  Only two of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News
predicted the BOK rate cut, while the rest forecast no change.  “This cut is unlikely to be the last and a second is
likely to come sooner rather than later,” Patrick Perret-Green,
head of Asian currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in Singapore,
wrote in a note today. “Against a softening global background,
and the particular deceleration of China, it was time for the
BOK to take a more macro-prudential approach.”  South  Korea ’s economy may expand 3.3 percent this year,
less than a December estimate of 3.7 percent, the  Finance
Ministry  said June 28. The Bank of Korea is scheduled to revise
its own 2012 growth forecast tomorrow, after reducing it to 3.5
percent in April from 3.7 percent.  China Concern  China’s  yuan  fell 0.03 percent to 6.3708 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The People’s Bank of China set the currency’s fixing 0.01
percent lower at 6.3215. Based on the forecasted 7.7 percent
pace, growth in the world’s second-largest economy will be the
slowest in three years. Exports increased 11.3 percent in June
from a year earlier, compared with 15.3 percent in May, official
data show.  “Market participants are concerned about China’s
condition,” said Shigehisa Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian
and emerging-markets team at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in Tokyo.
“External demand is weakening globally and exports may remain
sluggish.”  Elsewhere, the Philippine peso weakened 0.4 percent to
42.04 per dollar.  India ’s rupee dropped 0.3 percent to 55.8125,
Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to NT$29.999 and the Vietnamese
dong advanced 0.1 percent to 20,865.  To contact the reporters on this story:
