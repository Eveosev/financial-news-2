Iran ’s central bank opened a $10
billion line of credit for several upstream domestic oil
projects, the  Tehran Times  reported, citing Mohsen Khojasteh-
Mehr, who’s in charge of planning and supervision at the Oil
Ministry.  The ministry will soon submit priority projects to the
central bank, the newspaper said.  Projects will also be funded by using 18 percent of the
National Development Fund’s assets, selling $10 billion of
foreign currency bonds and 15 trillion of rial-denominated
bonds, and by selling $10 billion-worth of shares in Oil
Ministry properties, the Times said.  Iran puts 20 percent of its oil revenues into the
development fund, which will reach $55 billion by the end of the
Iranian year on March 20, 2013, the newspaper cited President
 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  as saying earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
