Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG (LLB) ’s
American clients had only declared $27 million of the $795
million they held at the Liechtenstein bank, Tages-Anzeiger
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Cyrill Sele, a spokesman for LLB, couldn’t immediately be
reached for comment when called at his office by Bloomberg News.  Liechtenstein sent letters in May to American clients of
LLB, the principality’s oldest bank, informing them that U.S.
authorities had requested their account data as they widen a
tax-evasion probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
