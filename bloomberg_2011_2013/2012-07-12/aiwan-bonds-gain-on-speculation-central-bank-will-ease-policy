Taiwan’s government bonds gained,
with 10-year yields dropping to the lowest in more than a month,
on speculation the central bank will follow South  Korea  in
cutting  interest rates . The local dollar weakened.  Bank of Korea  unexpectedly lowered the benchmark seven-day
repurchase rate to 3 percent today, the first reduction since
February 2009. Taiwan’s exports contracted for a fourth month in
June, while inflation was the highest since January, official
data showed in July.  “There’s speculation among traders that Taiwan’s central
bank will follow  South Korea ,” said George Pu, a bond trader at
Sinopac Securities Corp. in Taipei. “However, inflation is
still a problem and the central bank has to take that into
consideration.”  The yield on 1.25 percent notes due March 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.175 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the lowest for the
 benchmark  10-year yield since June 8.  Taiwan’s monetary authority kept  borrowing costs  unchanged
at 1.875 percent at a quarterly meeting last month. The  consumer
price  index rose 1.77 percent in June from a year earlier,
following a 1.74 percent increase the previous month.  The currency fell 0.1 percent to NT$30.013 against its U.S.
counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, fell 15 basis points to 3.65 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.509 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
