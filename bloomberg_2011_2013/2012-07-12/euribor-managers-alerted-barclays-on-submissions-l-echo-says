The association that manages the
setting of Euribor warned  Barclays (BARC)  Plc several years ago that
there was a problem with its submissions,  L’Echo reported .  Euribor, the Euro Interbank Offered Rate, is managed by
Euribor-EBF, a non-profit association linked to the banking
federation.  “It’s proven that a bank tried to manipulate Euribor, but
that did not have an impact in practice,” Guido Ravoet,
secretary general of the European Banking Federation, told the
Brussels-based newspaper in an interview published today.  Confidence in the euro and London interbank offered rates,
benchmarks for trillions of dollars’ worth of financial products
worldwide, has been dented following Barclays’s admission that
it submitted false rates.  European Union antitrust regulators in October raided banks
that offer financial derivatives linked to the Euribor rates,
saying they were investigating possible collusion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
