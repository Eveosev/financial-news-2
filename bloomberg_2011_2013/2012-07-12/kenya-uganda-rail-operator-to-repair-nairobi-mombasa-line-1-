Rift Valley Railways Ltd. , the
operator of the Kenya- Uganda  railway, has bought $19 million of
track to repair worn-out sections of the line from Nairobi, the
Kenyan capital, and the port city of  Mombasa .  RVR, as the company is known, shipped in 6,869 metric tons
of rail, 10,000 railroad ties, and other accessories, paid for
with part of a loan signed in August, Chief Executive Officer
Brown Ondego said today in an e-mailed statement. The section of
track being repaired is 70 kilometers (44 miles) long, he said.  “We expect to start laying the permanent way
immediately,” Ondego said. “We’ll progressively increase
speeds on the back of the developing efficiency on the tracks.”  The company in August signed a $164 million loan with six
development-finance institutions and  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s
biggest lender by market value, to upgrade cargo capacity to
almost triple its present 1.7 million tons annually and more
than double train speeds to 70 kilometers per hour.  RVR plans to invest $287 million over the next five years
to modernize its trains and tracks.  “We recently commissioned the construction of nine
culverts on the Uganda side of the track between Busembatia and
Jinja at a cost of $4.9 million which we expect to be completed
by December 2012,” Ondego said.  The company also bought wheels and other parts for rolling
stock in Kenya and Uganda, with the first phase of repairs
expected to be completed in December 2014 at a cost $62.1
million, he said.  RVR, which manages about 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles) of
railway in Kenya and Uganda, moves an average of 1.7 million
tonnes of cargo annually, giving it a market share of 7 percent.
The company plans to move 4.5 million tonnes of the 26 million
tonnes of cargo at the port of Mombasa by 2015, growing its
market share to as much as 12 percent, Ondego said.  Citadel Capital SAE. , an Egyptian private-equity company
with assets of with $8.7 billion, owns 51 percent of RVR.
 TransCentury Ltd. (TCL) , based in Nairobi, holds 34 percent and Bomi
Holdings of Uganda 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
