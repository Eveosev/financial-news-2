Ryanair, a low-fare carrier based in
Ireland, will be allowed by a French environmental panel to
expand at Beauvais airport, north of Paris,  Les Echos  reported,
citing local activists who had sought limits.  The Consultative Commission on the Environment voted on
July 10 against a plan that would have capped the number of
aircraft movements at Beauvais to 26,000 a year, the newspaper
said. Ryanair is the principal carrier serving the airport.  To contact the reporter on this story:
