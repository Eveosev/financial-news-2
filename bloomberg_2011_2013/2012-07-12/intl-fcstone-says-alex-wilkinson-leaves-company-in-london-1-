INTL FCStone Inc., one of 12

Exchange, said Alex Wilkinson left the company.  Kent Coughlin, a spokesman for INTL FCStone in Nashville,
 Tennessee , confirmed the departure today. Wilkinson was general
manager of clearing and execution services for Europe,  Middle
East  and Africa in London, according to information on the
company’s website.  Wilkinson was previously managing director of RBC Capital
Markets Ltd., responsible for the global futures business. He
also spent eight years at Dresdner Kleinwort, a unit of
Germany’s Allianz SE.  New York-based INTL FCStone provides advice, trading and
clearing in metals, grains and foreign currencies for more than
10,000 clients, according to the company’s website. The company
acquired the metals division of MF Global U.K. Ltd. last year
and also bought Ambrian Commodities, the LME brokerage unit of
Ambrian Capital Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
