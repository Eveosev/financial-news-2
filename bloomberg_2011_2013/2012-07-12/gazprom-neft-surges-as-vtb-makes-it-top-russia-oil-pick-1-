OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY)  gained by the most
this year in U.S. trading after VTB Capital said it “remains
bullish on the oil sector” and selected the stock as one of its
top picks.  Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of  Russia ’s natural gas export
monopoly, rose 4.5 percent to $23.82 in  New York , the biggest
gain since Dec. 20. The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of
Russian shares traded in New York ended little changed at 88.95.  “While remaining bullish on the sector we have now become
pickier in terms of investments in specific companies,” VTB
Capital analysts led by Dmitry Loukashov said in a report dated
today. “We split the companies into two categories on the back
of the quality of their investment governance practice. We
define ‘investment governance’ as a company’s ability to act in
the interest of shareholders, rather than in the interest of
management.”  VTB Capital prefers Gazprom Neft,  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY)  and  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Russian subsidiary TNK-BP against OAO Surgutneftegas, OAO
Tatneft, OAO Bashneft and  Alliance Oil (ALLZF) , according to the report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
