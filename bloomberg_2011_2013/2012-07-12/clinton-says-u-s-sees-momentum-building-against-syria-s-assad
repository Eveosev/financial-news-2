The U.S. sees growing pressure on
the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, Secretary of State
 Hillary Clinton  said today in Cambodia.  “We do see momentum building” against Assad, Clinton said
at a press conference in  Phnom Penh , citing the defection of
Damascus’ ambassador to Iraq and the crumbling economy.  Clinton said the U.S. is committed to supporting special
envoy  Kofi Annan ’s six-point plan for a political transition
that eases out Assad. She called on Russia to join the U.S. in
“a serious resolution that gives Annan what he needs, what he’s
been asking for and imposes real consequences” for failure to
comply.  Assad will not do anything without additional pressure,
said Clinton, who called on Syria’s military and business
community to reconsider their support for the president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
