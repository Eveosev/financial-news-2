Reykjavik’s District Court ordered
Valitor hf, the Icelandic partner of  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  and  Visa
Inc. (V) , to open card payments to anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks
within two weeks or face daily penalties of 800,000 kronur
($6,200), the court said today.  Valitor was sued by Icelandic data hosting service provider
DataCell, after the payment card company refused to process
payments to WikiLeaks the same day it signed a contract with
DataCell.  “This is a good day for the freedom of expression,”
Sveinn Andri Sveinsson, lawyer for DataCell, told reporters
after the ruling. If Valitor decides to appeal “it will be on
political grounds, not legal grounds.”  Valitor Chief Executive Officer Vidar Thorkellsson said by
telephone the company would appeal the ruling and declined
further comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
