Cocoa prices are likely to be
“relatively weak” in the current half as slowing economies
dent demand for the chocolate ingredient, especially in  Europe ,
according to Ecobank Transnational Inc.  European cocoa-bean processing declined 18 percent in the
second quarter to a three-year low, according to figures from
the European Cocoa Association. The so-called grind dropped to
292,551 metric tons from 355,763 tons a year earlier, the
Brussels-based industry group said in an e-mailed report today.  “Going into the second half of 2012, the improved weather
outlook across West Africa and concerns over faltering cocoa
demand, especially in Europe, are likely to keep prices
relatively weak,” Lome, Togo-based Ecobank said in a report e-
mailed today. There are “widespread expectations of a balanced
global market in 2012-13,” it said.  Rains last month will help the development of the next crop
that starts in October in top producer  Ivory Coast , the bank
said. The mid-crop, the smaller of two annual harvests that
usually starts in April, has been “disappointing” with “poor
quality,” the bank said. The 2011-12 crop in  Ghana , the second-
biggest grower, will be below industry regulator Cocobod’s
forecast of 850,000 tons, according to the report.  Coffee prices are likely to strengthen in the coming
months, with demand for the robusta variety showing “no signs
of flagging” and arabica prices near historical lows, the bank
said. Robusta has climbed 11 percent this year in London
trading, while arabica is down 20 percent in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
