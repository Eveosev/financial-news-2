Treasuries advanced along with the
bonds of other highly rated nations on concern central banks
need to take more action to sustain faltering global growth,
spurring demand for the safest assets.  U.S.  10-year yields  dropped to within five basis points of
a record low, while bonds also rallied in  Germany , the U.K.,
 Japan  and  Australia . Longer-maturity bonds led gains in
Treasuries after the  Federal Reserve  disappointed investors
yesterday by failing to signal further monetary easing. The $13
billion in 30-year debt the U.S. is scheduled to sell yielded a
record low in pre-auction trading.  “There’s the expectation of the Federal Reserve doing
more,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in New
York at Jefferies Group Inc., one of 21 primary dealers that
trades with the Fed. “The easing bias is still intact. It’s a
desire for safe, dollar-denominated assets, driven partly by the
Fed and by what’s going on in  Europe .”  The 10-year Treasury  yield  fell three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.48 percent at 12:25 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.75 percent
security due in May 2022 rose 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face
amount, to 102 14/32. The yield dropped to a record 1.4387
percent on June 1.  Thirty-year yields fell three basis points to 2.58 percent,
approaching the all-time low 2.5089 percent also set on June 1.  Applications for jobless benefits decreased last week
26,000 in the week ended July 7 to 350,000, the fewest since
March 2008, Labor Department figures showed today. Economists
forecast 372,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey.  ‘Reluctant’ Setup  “The bid in the market is due to a little bit of concern
about a global slowdown,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader at primary
dealer  Societe Generale  in New York. “It seems to be gripping
the market. There’s some concern that maybe the same demand for
the 10-year may show up for the 30-year, so guys are a bit
reluctant to set up for the market today.”  The 30-year Treasuries being sold today yielded 2.59
percent in pre-auction trading, versus 2.72 percent at the prior
sale June 14. Investors  bid  for 2.4 times the amount of debt
offered, the least since November at the monthly auctions.  The U.S. sold $21 billion of 10-year notes at an all-time
low rate of 1.459 percent yesterday as the auction attracted
record-high demand from a group of investors that include
pension funds and insurance companies.  Thirty-year bonds have returned 7.8 percent this year,
compared with 5 percent for 10-year notes and 0.1 percent for
two-year debt, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.  Volume, Volatility  A few Fed policy makers said the central bank will probably
need to take more action “to promote satisfactory growth in
employment and to ensure that the inflation rate would be at the
Committee’s goal,” according to minutes released yesterday
after the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s June 19-20 meeting.
The central bank’s next policy decision is due on Aug. 1.  Treasury trading  volume  reported yesterday by ICAP Plc, the
largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt  climbed to
$263.16 billion, the most since June 29. Trading averaged $242
billion this year.  Volatility closed yesterday at 63.8 basis points, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index. It dropped to a
five-year low of 56.7 basis points on May 7, and has averaged 76
basis points this year, touching a 2012 high of 95.4 basis
points on June 15. It reached a record high of 264.6 basis
points in October 2008 as the financial crisis intensified. The
index measures price swings based on options.  Korea, Brazil  The  Bank of Korea  cut borrowing costs for the first time in
more than three years today, lowering its  seven-day repurchase
rate  to 3 percent from 3.25 percent.  Brazil  reduced its
benchmark for an eighth meeting to 8 percent yesterday. The  Bank
of Japan (8301)  bolstered its asset-purchase fund while cutting a
credit-loan facility by the same amount.  The ECB cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75
percent on July 5 and the  Bank of England  expanded its bond-
buying program the same day.  Global economic growth will slow to 2.26 percent this year
from 2.9 percent in 2011, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Japan’s 10-year bond yield dropped two basis points to
0.765 percent, the lowest since 2003. German  two-year yields 
declined to a record low and were below zero for the fifth
straight day.  Australia’s 10-year yield dropped as much as 11 basis
points to 2.87 percent, while similar-maturity French rates
declined eight basis points to 2.24 percent. U.K. 10-year yields
fell five basis points to 1.51 percent.  The U.K. sold 3.5 billion pounds ($5.41 billion) of 10-year
gilts today at a record low yield of 1.719 percent.  Term Premium  The  term premium , a model created by the Fed that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, showed
Treasuries are the most expensive ever. The gauge fell to a
 record  negative 0.9617 percent on July 10. It was negative
0.9496 percent today.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of
so-called quantitative easing from 2008 to 2011 to support the
economy. In September it embarked on a plan to replace $400
billion of short-maturity Treasuries in its portfolio with
longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs. It expanded the effort
on June 20 by $267 billion and extended it until year-end.  The Fed sold $7.93 billion of Treasuries today due from
July 2013 to January 2014 as part of its Operation Twist
program. The central bank announced on June 20 it would extended
the program is replacing $667 billion of shorter-term securities
in its holdings with longer-term bonds through this month to
keep borrowing costs down.  To contact the reporters on this story:
