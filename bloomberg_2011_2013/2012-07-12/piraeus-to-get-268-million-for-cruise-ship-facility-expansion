Piraeus Port Authority SA (PPA) , the
state-owned company which operates  Greece ’s biggest port, said
it’s getting Greek and European Union funds to finance a 220
million-euro ($268 million) expansion of cruise-ship facilities.  Piraeus will receive 33 million euros in Greek state funds
and 187 million euros from the EU’s regional development aid
program to expand the port’s cruise-ship pier with construction
due to begin early in 2013, according to a  statement  today on
the authority’s website.  The expansion will enable Piraeus to modernize and become a
hub for large cruise ships in Greece which will benefit all
cruise ports in the country, Chief Executive Officer Yiorgos Anomeritis said in the statement.  New generation  cruise ships  are currently unable to dock at
Piraeus’s central piers because of their size. The expansion
will allow Piraeus, which also handles bulk cargo, containers,
tankers and passenger ferries, to become the Mediterranean’s
largest cruise-ship port, according to the statement.  Piraeus  Port Authority  is 51 percent owned by the Greek
state with another 23.1 percent held indirectly via the Hellenic
Republic Asset Development Fund which is responsible for state
asset sales.  Piraeus Port was included on the list of state asset sales
scheduled for 2012. A Greek Finance Ministry official yesterday
said the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund will only be
able to complete two sales this year neither of which is a
traded company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
