New Zealand ’s manufacturing industry
almost stalled last month while  consumer confidence  rebounded
from a 12-month low, private surveys showed today.  The performance of manufacturing  index  dropped to 50.2 in
June from 55.8 in May, Bank of New Zealand Ltd. and Business New
Zealand said today.  Consumer confidence  rose by 4.7 points in
July after falling 8.1 points in June, according to an ANZ
National Bank Ltd.-Roy Morgan index.  Sluggish manufacturing and consumer caution add to signs of
weak domestic demand and growth after gross domestic product
surged 1.1 percent in the first quarter. Investors are betting
the central bank may respond to slow growth and benign inflation
by cutting  interest rates  this year.  “Consumer confidence has been bouncing along a flat trend
for over a year, at a level that shows consumers remain wary,”
Sharon Zollner, senior economist at ANZ National in Wellington,
said in an e-mailed report.  Investors are pricing in a 54 percent chance the central
bank will lower the official cash rate this year, according to
 interest-rate swaps  figures compiled by Bloomberg.  Reserve Bank 
of New Zealand Governor Alan Bollard left the rate at a record-
low 2.5 percent on June 14 and signaled no change until 2013.  ANZ National’s consumer confidence index rose to 110.5 from
105.8 the prior month. An index of future conditions lagged
behind a gauge of present conditions for the first time since
the 2008 recession as a majority of consumers continue to expect
bad times over the next year, the report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
