Egypt ’s President Mohammed Mursi
will announce his first prime minister “within hours,”
Mahmoud Abul-Eyoun, the former central bank governor, being the
likeliest candidate, state-run Al-Gomhuria reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.  The announcement will be made as soon as Mursi returns from
his first foreign trip, to Saudi Arabia, the newspaper said,
without giving further details of when this will be. The Freedom
and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm, wants
35 percent of the posts in the new government, to include
services-related portfolios, according to Al-Gomhuria, which
named Essam El-Erian and Mohammed El-Beltagy, among the party’s
leaders, as possible cabinet members.  Talks are in progress on the defense, interior and justice
ministries, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
