Bank of America Corp. cut its
earnings estimates for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index for 2012
and 2013, citing concern that lower commodity prices and slower
global growth will weigh on corporate profits.  Strategists for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank
reduced earnings forecasts for  S&P 500 (SPX)  companies by 1.4 percent
for this year and next year. Strategists Dan Suzuki, Savita
Subramanian and Jill Carey now project income of $102 per share
for 2012 and $109 for 2013, implying growth of 4 percent and 7
percent, respectively, according to a note to clients today.  “Although the bottom-up consensus forecasts have continued
to drift lower since last summer, they still appear too
optimistic,” the strategists wrote in a note today. “The
recent weakness in earnings revision and guidance trends may be
a sign that consensus expectations are in the early stages of
being reset lower.”  The  S&P 500  is heading for a sixth day of losses amid signs
that corporate earnings are falling. Marriott International
Inc., the biggest publicly traded U.S. hotel chain, cut its
forecast for growth outside  North America  and  Warren Buffett ,
the billionaire chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., told CNBC
that economic growth in the U.S. is slowing.  Energy companies are estimated to post the weakest results
this year, with a 10 percent drop in earnings, after oil hit a
nine-month low in June, Bank of America said. The decline in
profits from the oil and gas industry will be offset by
increased income from technology companies, such as Apple Inc.  Analysts are forecasting the first decline in quarterly
earnings since 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show, after
slowdowns in China and  Europe  reduced overseas demand. Earnings
at S&P 500 companies probably decreased 1.8 percent in the
second quarter and will increase 7.2 percent for all of 2012,
based on analysts’ forecasts compiled by Bloomberg.  The U.S. earnings season started July 9 after aluminum
maker  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  reported earnings that beat analysts’
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
