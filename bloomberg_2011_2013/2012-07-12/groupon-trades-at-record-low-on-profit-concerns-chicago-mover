Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , the biggest online
coupon company, fell to the lowest price since the company’s
initial public offering in November amid concerns over its
ability to profit from daily deals.  The stock dropped 5.7 percent to $7.33 at 10:01 a.m. in New
York, and earlier declined as much as 6.7 percent to $7.25.
Through yesterday, the shares of the Chicago-based company had
declined 61 percent since they started trading on Nov. 4, 2011.  The company generates revenue by selling discounts --
called Groupons -- from businesses such as restaurants and nail
salons. Its business model is under seige from daily deals
offered by competitors such as Google Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and
 Yelp Inc. (YELP)   “People are assuming that Groupon is going to have a
difficult quarter,” said  Arvind Bhatia , an analyst at Sterne,
Agee & Leach in Dallas, in a telephone interview today. “There
hasn’t been much communication so we’ll have to wait until they
report June quarter numbers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
