Earnings for the largest commodity
carriers fell for a third day as vessels outnumbered cargoes
after last week’s gains drew idled ships back into the market.  Daily income for Capesizes, the largest ships hauling  iron
ore  and coal, fell 12 percent to $6,472, the largest decrease
since May 24, according to the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based
publisher of freight rates. The decline led the Baltic Dry
Index, a broader measure of raw-material shipping costs, down
2.2 percent to 1,121 points, figures showed today.  Rates are retreating after almost doubling last week.
Owners that tried to lift earnings by idling their vessels are
now re-entering competition for cargoes, overwhelming demand to
book shipments of iron ore to  China , said  Jeffrey Landsberg ,
managing director of New York-based Commodore Research &
Consulting.  “Capesize demand is pretty firm so it’s really just too
many vessels being brought into the available market,” he said
by phone today. “As rates rose owners began to put hidden or
idle vessels back into their tonnage lists.”  Daily earnings for Panamaxes, which can hold about half as
much cargo as Capesizes, rose 1.1 percent to $9,466, exchange
data shows. The two smallest vessels tracked by the index,
Supramaxes and Handysizes, both fell less than 1 percent to
$13,527 and $10,066, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
