Gasoil for July moved into a
discount, or contango, to the August contract before the front-
month expiry today on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Benchmark heating oil futures for July were at $858 a
metric ton at 11:51 a.m. London time ahead of their expiration
today at 12 p.m. Thatâ€™s 50 cents less than August, the more
active second-month contract.  A contango market reflects rising near-term supplies or
declining demand. The spread had traded in the reverse
structure, or backwardation, since April 13. Prices fluctuated
between the two structures today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
