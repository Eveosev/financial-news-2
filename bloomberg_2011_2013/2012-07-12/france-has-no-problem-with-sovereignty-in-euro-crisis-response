France  is ready to cede sovereignty
to its European partners if it helps create greater willingness
to share the financial burden of a common currency, European
Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.  “We are aware that more solidarity needs more integration,
so less sovereignty,” Cazeneuve said in an interview in Paris
yesterday. “The problem of France is not sovereignty. The crisis 
is very deep, we want to organize this solidarity in order to be
strong in front of the markets.”  French President  Francois Hollande  has advocated bonds
backed by all 17 members of the euro area to help end the
region’s sovereign debt crisis. German politicians such as Kurt
Lauk have replied that if France wants euro bonds, it should
agree to give up power over its own financial affairs in return.  Chancellor Angela Merkel  indicated that she would accept
euro bonds after deeper political integration in  Europe  has been
achieved, Lauk told journalists in Berlin on June 11. Lauk is a
former European lawmaker who heads a business group in Merkel’s
 Christian Democratic Union .  Cazeneuve said in the interview that he expects euro-area
governments to agree on a new system of bank supervision for the
17-member bloc by year end and that agreement will help calm
debt markets.  “We are in kind of a transition now,” Cazeneuve said.
“The situation in the markets is more difficult now than it
will be by the end of the year.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
