TNK-BP, the Russian oil producer
half-owned by  BP Plc (BP/) , upgraded its Ryazan refinery to produce
gasoline that meets Euro-5 environmental standards.  The refinery will produce 104,000 metric tons of the 95-
octane fuel in July and increase output to 125,000 tons in the
coming months, TNK-BP said today in a  statement , without being
more specific.  Ryazan is TNK-BP’s largest plant in  Russia  with a
processing capacity of 341,000 barrels of crude a day, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Russia, which links taxes on motor fuels to the their
environmental impact, reduced the levy on low-sulfur Euro-5
gasoline to 5,143 rubles ($156.86) a ton from July 1 from 6,822
rubles previously.  Euro-5 gasoline has a maximum sulfur content of 10 parts
per million. A lower sulfur content means less pollution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
