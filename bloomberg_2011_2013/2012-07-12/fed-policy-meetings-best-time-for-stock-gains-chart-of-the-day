The most rewarding time for
investors to own U.S. stocks is when the  Federal Reserve ’s
policy makers get together, according to a study published by
the central bank’s  New York  branch.  Most of the Standard & Poor 500 Index’s gains between
September 1994 and March 2011 were recorded around the time of
regular meetings, the results showed. The index climbed about
180 percent during those 17 years.  The CHART OF THE DAY tracks the S&P 500 before, during and
after the  Federal Open Market Committee  on April 25. Members
left policy unchanged at the gathering.  Three-day intervals were analyzed in the study by David O. Lucca and Emanuel Moench, economists at the New York Fed. The
periods started the day before the panel announced each of its
decisions and ended the day after.  “Pre-FOMC announcement ‘drift’” largely explained the  S&P
500 ’s moves, they wrote yesterday on the New York Fed’s Liberty
Street Economics blog. The  posting  highlighted their research,
published June 14 on the Social Science Research Network in a
revised  version .  The 24 hours that ended at 2 p.m. Eastern time on
announcement days were the most lucrative, according to the
study. The S&P 500 gained an average of 0.5 percent more than
one-month Treasury bills during those periods. In other 24-hour
periods throughout the years, the index’s performance was about
the same as the bills. Policy decisions were disclosed at about
2:15 p.m. before April 2011, when some releases were moved to
12:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
