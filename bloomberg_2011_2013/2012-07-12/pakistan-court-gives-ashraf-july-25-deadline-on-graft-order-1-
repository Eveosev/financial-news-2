Pakistan ’s top court directed Prime
Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf to seek the reopening of graft cases
against the president by July 25, Geo television reported, an
issue that led to the ousting of his predecessor.  Ashraf had sought more time to consult the law ministry
before submitting his reply to the court, the broadcaster said.  The  Supreme Court  evicted Yousuf Raza Gilani from the prime
minister’s office on June 19 after he refused to abide by the
court’s earlier order that he ask Swiss authorities to resume
corruption probes against Asif Ali Zardari.  Pakistan’s ruling coalition elected Ashraf on June 22 to
replace Gilani.  Negotiating with political parties to stay on as a civilian
president, military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2007 decreed an
amnesty to halt corruption probes against 8,000 politicians and
officials, including Zardari and his wife, assassinated former
premier  Benazir Bhutto .  To contact the reporter on this story:
