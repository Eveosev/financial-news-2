U.S. stocks trimmed losses as
rallies of more than 4 percent in  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  and Merck
& Co. helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average erase most of an
earlier 112 point drop.  P&G climbed the most in more than two years after the
Federal Trade Commission cleared  William Ackman ’s hedge fund
company to take a stake in the maker of household products.
Merck rallied to a four-year high after reporting that an
osteoporosis drug worked well in a trial.  The Dow lost 20.78 points to 12,583.75 at 1:19 p.m. in New
York. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.4 percent to
1,336.16 after tumbling as much as 1.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
