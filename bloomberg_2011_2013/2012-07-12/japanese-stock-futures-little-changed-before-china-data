Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  were unchanged ahead of reports today that are forecast
to show  China’s economy  is slowing. Shares may fall in Tokyo
after the yen rose yesterday following the  Bank of Japan ’s
decision to refrain from boosting monetary stimulus.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
biggest camera maker, lost 1.8 percent from the closing share
price in Tokyo. Those of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s largest
miner and oil producer, rose 0.3 percent as crude prices gained.
Shares of Dentsu Inc. may be active after the Japanese
advertising company agreed to buy Britain’s Aegis Group Plc in a
3.16 billion pound ($4.9 billion) deal.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 8,700 in Chicago yesterday, unchanged from
the closing level in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-
market at 8,700 in Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index were unchanged today. New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index slid 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “Concern is mounting about a slowdown in the global
economy,” said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Tokyo-based
Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s biggest brokerage. “Should
Chinese data slow more than expected, that would boost bets
about policy measures such as interest-rate cuts and public
investment.”  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.1 percent
today. The index fell 0.5 percent in New York yesterday,
dropping for a sixth day, the longest losing streak since May
18.  China Growth  A government report today will show China’s  economic growth 
rate fell below 8 percent for the first time since 2009,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists. Reports on industrial production and retail sales
are also due today.  China’s new loans beat estimates in June, boosting odds the
government will secure an economic rebound after growth probably
slowed for a sixth quarter. Banks extended 919.8 billion yuan
($144.3 billion) of local-currency loans, the People’s Bank of
China said yesterday. That compares with the 880 billion  yuan 
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  The yen rose against all of its 16 major counterparts
yesterday after the Bank of Japan refrained from expanding
monetary stimulus. A stronger yen reduces the value of
exporters’ offshore income when repatriated.  The BOJ expanded its asset-purchase program to 45 trillion
yen ($564 billion) from 40 trillion yen. The loan facility was
cut to 25 trillion yen from 30 trillion yen.  Crude oil for August delivery gained 27 cents to settle at
$86.08 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 0.7 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 6.1 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 3.4 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.7 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
