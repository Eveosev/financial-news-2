Bulgaria’s President Rossen
Plevneliev said his country will adopt the euro as its currency
in the future,  Die Welt  reported, citing an interview.  The euro must survive and the expansion of democracy in
eastern  Europe  must continue, the newspaper cited Plevneliev as
saying. The “right recipe” for Europe is fiscal discipline and
structural reforms for more competitiveness and growth, he told
Die Welt, adding that Bulgaria’s budget deficit is likely to
fall below 1.6 percent of gross domestic product this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
