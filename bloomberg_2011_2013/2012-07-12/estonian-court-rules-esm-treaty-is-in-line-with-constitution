Estonia ’s  Supreme Court  ruled the
founding treaty of the European Stability Mechanism is in line
with the Baltic nation’s constitution, allowing Parliament to
ratify joining the euro area’s permanent rescue fund.  Justice Chancellor Indrek Teder said in March that a clause
in the treaty allowing decisions on financial assistance to be
made with an 85 percent qualified majority violates the
constitution and asked the Supreme Court to reject it.  The treaty was “deemed constitutional,” the Tartu,
Estonia-based court said today in an e-mailed statement. “The
Supreme Court is of the position that although the contested
article restricts the financial competence of the Estonian
parliament, the principle of rule of law and the sovereignty of
Estonia, the restriction is justified.”  Europe’s permanent bailout fund will succeed the temporary
European Financial Stability Facility, or EFSF, which was used
to provide emergency loans to Ireland and Portugal and a second
round of aid to Greece. The newest euro member’s contribution to
the ESM would be 0.186 percent of the total, compared with
guarantees of 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion), or 0.27 percent,
of the EFSF.  The ESM would provide Estonia with long-term credit
guarantees to ensure the functioning of the state in the event
of a crisis, according to the  Finance Ministry . Estonia lacks a
veto at the  International Monetary Fund , the  World Bank , the
European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development  and other
international financial organizations that also use qualified-
majority voting, it has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
