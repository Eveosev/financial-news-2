Hidroelectrica SA,  Romania ’s state-
owned hydropower generator, will cut electricity supplies to
about 50 percent from Aug. 1 as a drought lowered river water
levels.  Hidrolectrica, declared insolvent last month, will activate
a force-majeure clause for its bilateral contracts with
companies such as  Alro SA (ALR) , the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The utility took similar steps last year following a
prolonged drought. Its court administrator is in talks with
companies buying electricity in bilateral contracts to increase
the sale price and bring it closer to the market, Hidroelectrica
said in the statement.  The International Monetary Fund and the European Union have
asked Romania to negotiate Hidroelectrica’s contracts after the
EU competition regulator started an investigation into possible
state aid on selling power at below-market prices. The European
Commission said on July 6 a contract between Hidroelectrica and
a local unit of  ArcelorMittal (MT)  may have included undue state aid
for the steel producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
