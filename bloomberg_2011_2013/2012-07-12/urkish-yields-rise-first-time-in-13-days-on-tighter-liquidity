Turkish bond  yields  rose for the
first time in 13 days after the central bank cut by half the
amount of daily liquidity it offers to lenders, tightening  money
supply .  Yields on two-year benchmark debt rose two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 7.92 percent, paring this month’s fall
to 55 basis points.  The central bank reduced the size of its lending at the
lowest 5.75 percent funding rate by 50 percent today from last
week, providing 1 billion liras ($551 million) in its repurchase
agreements auction. The overnight cost of borrowing increased to
8.2 percent yesterday in the  interbank market , the highest level
since July 4. This compares with 9.6 percent at the end of June.  “The central bank will probably not cut the funding cost
further in the short term,” Erkin Isik, a fixed-income
strategist at  Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS (TEBNK) , said in e-mailed
comments. It will hold the “funding rate around 8 percent,” he
said.  The lira depreciated for the first time in three days, down
0.7 percent to 1.8229 per dollar, paring its gain this year to
3.8 percent.  The dollar gained versus all of its 16 most-traded peers
except the yen after  South Korea  unexpectedly lowered  interest
rates , while the euro slid below $1.22 for the first time since
July 2010. The  Bank of Japan (8301)  refrained from expanding stimulus
on signs of domestic economic strength. Australia’s dollar
dropped after employers cut payrolls.  The Federal Reserve yesterday disappointed investors
seeking a more definitive signal for further quantitative-easing
measures, fueling the global risk-off sentiment. China’s
economic growth slowed to an annual 7.7 percent last quarter
from 8.1 percent in the previous three months, according to a
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
