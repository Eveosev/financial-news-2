OPEC’s net crude oil production
capacity is expected to rise by 245,000 barrels a day next year
to 35.03 million barrels a day, the  International Energy Agency 
said, 85 percent lower than the IEA estimated in 2011.  Growth will be lower due to downward revisions to output
capacity in Iran, Qatar and  Algeria , the Paris-based IEA said in
its monthly Oil Market Report. The agency’s December 2011 report
forecast that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would be able to pump 36.39 million barrels a day in 2013.  Iran’s production capacity will fall by about 570,000
barrels a day to an average 2.67 million barrels a day in 2013,
the report said, as full sanctions by the European Union that
began July 1 continue. Expected output from Qatar and Algeria
has been revised downward by a combined 440,000 barrels a day.  “The outlook assumes there is no positive resolution
reached in the current round of discussions and that sanctions
continue through 2013” on Iran, the agency said. “The stiffer
banking regulations and shipping insurance constraints will
continue to lead to reduced exports and ultimately force Iranian
officials to mothball  oil fields , though it is impossible to
predict the pace.”  Iraq , the United Arab Emirates, Libya and  Angola  are
expected to together add almost 1 million barrels a day in 2013
in net volumes, partially offsetting “sharply lower Iranian
capacity,” the report said. OPEC capacity rose by about 750,000
barrels a day this year, largely reflecting a recovery in Libyan
output from low 2011 levels, the agency said.  Iraq will increase capacity by 440,000 barrels a day to an
average 3.38 million, according to the IEA data. Annual levels
“mask a significant upward trend,” with capacity rising from
2.99 million barrels a day in the first quarter of this year to
3.74 million barrels a day by the fourth quarter of 2013.  U.A.E. capacity will gain 219,000 barrels a day to 3.03
million, Libya’s will rise to 1.6 million from 1.28 million,
while Angola plans to add 143,000 barrels a day to 1.98 million.  Capacity in  Saudi Arabia , the world’s biggest oil exporter,
is forecast to decline by 25,000 barrels a day to 11.86 million,
the agency said. It will rebound in 2014 as the 900,000 barrel-
a-day Manifa project ramps up, it said.  OPEC’s members are Algeria, Angola,  Ecuador , Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab
Emirates and  Venezuela .  To contact the reporter on this story:
