Mitt Romney  gave a speech to the NAACP in Houston yesterday, producing a vivid array of polarized reactions. In the Washington Post, Michael Moynihan  congratulated  Romney "for entering the lion’s den, getting  briefly hooted down by a hostile crowd, and keeping your composure." In Moynihan's telling, the candidate's speech before a crowd of confirmed Obama partisans was an act of personal courage.  Well, personal courage bolstered by a bit of political calculation: "This seemed to be an appeal to independent white voters," Moynihan wrote, "the Romney  camp underscoring their man’s willingness to reach across the aisle and,  by implication, to show that he isn’t a zealous tea partyer interested  in expanding the partisan divide." Writing  in the Daily Beast, Michael Tomasky didn't see Romney as a "zealous tea partyer" so much as a "race-mongering pyromaniac." Race-baiting, Tomasky said, was the whole point of the speech, which was engineered to show Romney staring down a sea of black faces and offering them nothing but an insulting reference to "Obamacare," which elicited the desired boos from the crowd. Hey, it  worked  for  Rush Limbaugh , who rallied to Romney’s side, opined that the  speech went “over" the audience's heads and attributed the boos to the fact that Romney is white. Here's how the candidate himself subsequently  characterized  the speech, speaking to supporters yesterday at a Romney fundraiser: As in the 2008 presidential campaign, race has never been far beneath the surface of this one. Aside from income and status, Limbaugh is a pretty good stand-in for the cohort of white voters whom pollsters delicately call "resentful." If he was pleased with the theatrics of the speech, they probably were too. It seems equally plausible that independent white voters will credit Romney for entering territory perceived as hostile (how many instances of polite applause would be required to bump a single case of booing from the news?). Shout out to the base? Check. Reach out to independents? Check. There are as many ways to view the speech as there are racial attitudes in the U.S. But when Romney strategists looked into the kaleidoscope themselves, my guess is they saw a win.
