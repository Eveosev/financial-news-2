Treasuries rallied as an almost
insatiable desire for the safest assets bolstered demand at the
government’s sale of $13 billion in 30-year bonds, the second
consecutive U.S. auction to attract a record low yield.  The long bonds were sold at a yield of  2.580 percent , down
from the previous mark of 2.72 percent at a June 14 sale.
Yesterday’s 10-year note auction drew a yield of 1.459 percent.
Bonds of other highly rated nations including  Germany , the U.K.,
 Japan  and  Australia  also rallied on concern central banks need
to take more action to sustain faltering global growth.  “Investors are still hungry for yield, safety and
liquidity in this risk-off environment,” said Aaron Kohli, an
interest-rate strategist in New York BNP Paribas SA, which as a
primary dealer is required to bid at auctions. “Even though
yields are incredibly low, it’s better than taking a loss in
risky assets, and the liquidity is worth paying for. That drove
the strong demand at the auction.”  The yield on the  30-year bond  fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.56 percent in trading at 5 p.m.  New
York  time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched
a record low of 2.5089 percent on June 1.  The benchmark  10-year note  yield declined four basis points
to 1.47 percent. It touched its lowest, 1.4387 percent, on June
1.  Treasuries rose earlier even as applications for jobless
benefits decreased 26,000 in the week ended July 7 to 350,000,
the fewest since March 2008, Labor Department figures showed.
Economists forecast 372,000 claims, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Debt Auctions  The bond auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand
by comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered,
was 2.7, same as the average at the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders , a class of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 36.8 percent of the 30-year bonds,
the highest since September, compared with 32.5 percent at the
June auction. The average for the past 10 offerings is 31.6
percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 20.1 percent
versus 24 percent at last month’s sale. The average at the past
10 auctions is 17.3 percent.  The U.S. sold $21 billion of 10-year notes yesterday at a
 record-low yield  of 1.459 percent. The direct bid was a record
45.4 percent, compared with direct bids of 10.2 percent for the
$32 billion three-year note sale on July 10. Today’s offering
was the last of three Treasury note and bond auctions this week
totaling $66 billion.  ‘Tremendous Demand’  “What yesterday and today’s auctions tell you is that
there’s still tremendous demand for Treasuries, even at these
levels,” said  Thomas Roth , senior trader in New York at
Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA Inc. “It’s the same type of
things we’ve been seeing, a continuous flow of money into bond
funds. It’s safe-haven money looking for a home.”  Thirty-year bonds have returned 7.8 percent this year,
compared with 5 percent for 10-year notes and 0.1 percent for
two-year debt, according to indexes compiled by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.  The  term premium , a model created by the Fed that includes
expectations for  interest rates , growth and inflation, showed
Treasuries are the almost most expensive ever. The gauge fell to
a record negative 0.9617 percent on July 10. It was negative
0.9435 percent today.  Volatility fell to 63.4 basis points, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index. It dropped to a five-year
low of 56.7 basis points on May 7, and has averaged 76 basis
points this year, touching a 2012 high of 95.4 basis points on
June 15. It reached a record high of 264.6 basis points in
October 2008 as the financial crisis intensified. The index
measures price swings based on options.  ‘Easing Bias’  The Fed sold $7.93 billion of Treasuries today due from
July 2013 to January 2014 as part of its Operation Twist
program. The central bank announced on June 20 it would extended
the program, which is replacing $667 billion of shorter-term
securities in its holdings with longer-term bonds to keep
borrowing costs down.  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two
rounds of so-called quantitative easing from 2008 to 2011 to
support the economy. Minutes from the Fed’s June policy meeting,
released yesterday, failed to signal more stimulus measures to
spur economic growth.  “There’s the expectation of the  Federal Reserve  doing
more,” said Thomas Simons, a government-debt economist in New
York at Jefferies Group Inc., a primary dealer. “The easing
bias is still intact. It’s a desire for safe, dollar-denominated
assets, driven partly by the Fed and by what’s going on in
 Europe .”  To contact the reporters on this story:
