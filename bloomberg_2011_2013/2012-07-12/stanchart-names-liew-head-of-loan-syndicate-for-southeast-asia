Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  named Bryan Liew as head of loan syndications  Southeast Asia  as the bank
rearranges its team after two departures, the lender said.  Liew takes over from former head Pat Waranimman, while also
retaining his previous responsibilities as part of the leveraged
finance syndicate, Philip Cracknell, Hong Kong-based global head
of loan syndications and deputy head of  capital markets , said by
phone today.  David Kempton, global head of loan syndicate and
distribution, will also act as Standard Chartered’s head of loan
distribution for Southeast Asia after Yong Mee Ching left,
according to Cracknell, who declined to comment further.  Standard Chartered is ranked second this year behind HSBC
Holdings Plc in arranging loans in dollars, euros and yen for
companies in Asia outside of Japan, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Asia-Pacific region accounted for 60 percent
of the London-based bank’s  revenue  in 2011, the data show.  James Bragg will become global deputy head of loan
syndicate and distribution, while retaining his position as co-
head of loan distribution for Northeast Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
