Cheniere Energy Partners LP (CQP)  got
commitments for about $3.4 billion to fund construction of
liquefied natural gas export facilities at its Sabine Pass
terminal in  Louisiana .  Along with $2 billion from a previous investment by
Blackstone Group LP, the partnership now has $5.4 billion to
build the first two phases of its liquefaction project,
according to a Cheniere statement today.  “Our ability to access a very large credit facility will
significantly reduce our costs of financing during
construction,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Charif Souki said in the statement.  Cheniere Energy Partners rose 2.2 percent to $23.92 at the
close in New York. The partnership is controlled by Houston-
based  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG) , which  surged  10 percent to $15.59.  The liquefaction facilities will be able to chill gas to
minus 260 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 162 Celsius) so it can be
transported overseas by ship. A glut of North American gas has
prompted plans to convert existing import terminals to export
the fuel.  Korea Gas Corp., BG Group Plc, Gas Natural SDG SA and Gail
India Ltd. have agreed to buy a combined 16 million tons a year
from the Sabine Pass terminal, according to Cheniere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
