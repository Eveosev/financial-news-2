The yen traded 0.4 percent from the
strongest level in six weeks against the euro as signs global
growth is slowing boosted demand for haven assets.  China’s economy  expanded by less in the second quarter than
the median estimate of economists in Bloomberg News survey.
Australia’s dollar rose as Asian stocks rallied following the
data from  China , the South Pacific nation’s biggest trading
partner. The euro was 0.4 percent from a two-year low against
the dollar after Moody’s Investors Services cut  Italy ’s bond
rating before the nation sells debt today.  “It’s just confirmation that the risks to global growth
are tilted to the downside,”  Sacha Tihanyi , a strategist in
 Hong Kong  at Scotiabank, a unit of  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , said in
reference to China’s gross domestic product figures. “There’s
still some support for the yen and dollar.”  The yen was little changed at 96.78 per euro as of 6:31
a.m. in  London  from yesterday, when it reached 96.43, the
strongest level since June 1. Japan’s currency is set for a 1.1
percent gain this week against the euro. The yen traded at 79.27
per dollar from 79.31 yesterday, when it advanced 0.6 percent.
It’s poised for a 0.5 percent weekly gain.  The euro bought $1.2210 from $1.2203 yesterday, when it
touched $1.2167, the least since June 2010. The Australian
dollar climbed 0.3 percent to $1.0173.  China Growth  China’s GDP expanded 7.6 percent last quarter from a year
earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said in Beijing
today. The pace, the slowest in three years, was still above the
estimates of 12 of the 38 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks rose 0.5 percent,
trimming its weekly decline to 2.8 percent.  The yen was set to gain versus all 16 of its major peers
this week after Singapore’s economy unexpectedly contracted last
quarter and ahead of a report forecast to show U.S.  consumer
confidence  stagnated.  Singapore’s gross domestic product fell an annualized 1.1
percent last quarter, according to a government report today.
The figure compares with estimates for a 0.6 percent rise. The
country’s bonds advanced, pushing yields down to a record. The
local dollar was little changed at $1.2700.  In the U.S., the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan
final index of sentiment probably rose to 73.5 this month from
73.2 in June, the lowest this year, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the release
of the data today.  The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index held at minus 37.5 in
the week ended July 8. Some 86 percent of those surveyed said
the economy was in bad shape, 21 percentage points higher than
the average since 1985.  Yen Haven  Japan ’s currency tends to strengthen during periods of
financial and economic turmoil because the nation’s current-
account surplus means it isn’t reliant on foreign capital.  The yen gained 6.3 percent in the past three months, the
best performance among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The dollar
rose 3.9 percent, while the euro dropped 3.8 percent.  Italy will sell bonds maturing in 2015, 2019, 2022 and 2023
today. Moody’s cut its debt rating to Baa2 from A3. That makes
the country’s grade the same as those of Kazakhstan, Bulgaria
and  Brazil , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Italy’s downgrade by Moody’s may pave the way for “massive
selling” of the nation’s bonds, according to Shinji Kunibe,
chief portfolio manager for fixed-income investment in  Tokyo  at
Nissay Asset Management Corp., which oversees the equivalent of
$69 billion. “I have an underweight bias on the euro.”  More Leeway  Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  has been lobbying
European partners to agree on a plan to give the region’s
permanent bailout fund more leeway to buy the bonds of countries
meeting their fiscal goals. He wants the the European Stability
Mechanism to purchase the debt of nations including Italy and
Spain to lower their yields.  The rate on Italy’s 10-year debt added 10 basis points, or
0.10 percentage point, to 5.91 percent yesterday after reaching
6.22 percent on June 13, the highest close since Jan. 25.  “Italy’s downgrade brings the market’s attention back to
the risks surrounding the  European debt crisis ,” said Kengo Suzuki, a foreign-exchange strategist in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co., a unit of Japan’s third-largest bank by market
value. “The euro will continue to decline on its own.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
