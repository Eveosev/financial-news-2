Sewage disposal in  China , the
world’s most populous nation, is the “most promising” segment
of the country’s environmental industry, according to a new
research report.  The market report released today by ReportsnReports.com
said demand for sewage treatment, rather than releasing raw
sewage in waterways, is on the rise as China’s population and
water consumption increases. There were 3,135 urban sewage
treatment facilities in China through the end of last year, 153
more than a year earlier, ReportsnReports said.  “Driven by the gradual expanding demand for sewage
disposal of the market and government policies, China’s sewage
disposal industry is expected to continue the rapid development
trend,” the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
