Allianz Global Investors, which
oversees the equivalent of $305 billion, is selling the euro
against the dollar saying the region’s leaders aren’t being
proactive enough to stem the market turmoil.  “The euro should weaken,” Andreas Utermann, Frankfurt-
based chief global investment officer at Allianz, said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move” with
 Francine Lacqua . “We fear the policy makers will continue to be
driven by the markets.”  Utermann said he is “short euro, long dollar.” A short
position is a bet currency will decline in value, while a long-
position is a wager it will increase.  The euro fell 0.5 percent to $1.2174 at 12:54 p.m. London
time, after reaching $1.2170, the lowest level since June 2010.  Utermann said he is “concerned about” the German
Constitutional Court’s view on  Europe ’s rescue mechanisms and
about the risk that  Greece  may leave the shared currency.  “When the euro was launched, it actually went to 81 cents
against the dollar,” he said. “I am not predicting that, but
certainly weakness in the euro will help the  euro zone  fix some
of its problems.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
