New World Resources Plc (NWR) , the biggest
Czech producer of coking coal, headed for its lowest in two
weeks as concern the global economic recovery is faltering hurt
demand for commodities.  The stock slid 1.5 percent to 101.50 koruna by 1:26 a.m. in
Prague, extending this week’s loss to 3.3 percent. A close at
that level would be the lowest since June 28. The  PX (PX)  equity
index, in which NWR has a 3.6 percent weighting, retreated 0.9
percent.  Stocks and commodities fell after the U.S. Federal Reserve
disappointed investors seeking a more definitive signal for more
quantitative-easing measures in the world’s largest economy.
Europe’s benchmark coal derivatives dropped 0.4 percent to
$95.50 a metric ton in the Netherlands, a fifth day of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
