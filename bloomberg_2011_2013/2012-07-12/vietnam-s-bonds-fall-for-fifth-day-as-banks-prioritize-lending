Vietnam ’s bonds dropped for a fifth
day on speculation banks will focus on boosting lending to meet
the central bank’s annual target amid urgings from policy makers.
The dong gained.  Governor Nguyen Van Binh ordered banks on July 7 to “be
determined and quick in reducing lending rates to help
companies.” Credit expanded 0.76 percent this year as of June
30, short of the targeted 14 percent to 15 percent for the full
year and 8 percent to 10 percent for the second half, the  State
Bank  of Vietnam said in a July 7 statement.  “The  bond market  has been quiet, partially due to slow
credit growth,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based fixed-income
trader at Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam. “Banks
will try to give out more loans to meet the target.”  The  yield  on benchmark five-year notes rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 9.83 percent in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong appreciated 0.1 percent to 20,870 per dollar as of
3:50 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the daily  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged
since Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is allowed to
trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
