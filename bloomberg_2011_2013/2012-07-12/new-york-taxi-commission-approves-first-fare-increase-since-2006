New York  City’s Taxi & Limousine
Commission approved a 17 percent fare increase for yellow cabs,
giving drivers their first raise since 2006.  The agency voted 6 to 2 with one abstention to approve the
change at a meeting in  Manhattan  today. They rejected an
increase in how much fleet owners may charge drivers who lease
cabs from them, while permitting independent driver-owners who
lease out their vehicles part-time to charge more.  Starting in September, the cost of an average taxi ride
will rise $2 to about $15, said Allan Fromberg, a commission
spokesman. That means a driver will take home an average of $160
after a 12-hour shift, up from $130, said commission Chairman
David Yassky.  “It is time for a raise, and I think the public
understands that,” Yassky said at the meeting. “The public is
prepared to pay more for taxi drivers to make a living.”  Cab meters will click 50-cent increments for each fifth of
a mile (0.3 kilometer) traveled, or for each minute in stopped
or slow traffic, up from 40 cents. A ride between  John F.
Kennedy International Airport  and Manhattan will rise to $52
from $45, plus tolls. The Newark Liberty International Airport
surcharge will be $17.50, up from $15.  Hack Gripe  The increase places New York fourth in cost for an average
taxi ride, behind  Tokyo ,  San Francisco  and  Los Angeles ,
according to a  commission comparison  of 12 cities with large
numbers of taxi riders. New York’s 13,000 yellow cabs carry
about 600,000 people in 450,000 trips each day, Fromberg said.  Fleet owners, represented by the Metropolitan Taxi Cab
Board of Trade, opposed the new fares, saying they also should
have been permitted to charge drivers more to lease cabs.
Drivers pay a fleet owner about $120 to $130 a day for use of a
cab and its medallion, or operating license.  Cabbies also pay for gasoline and a 5 percent fee to the
fleet owner for each fare paid with a  credit card , which
averages about $8 a day -- a gripe among hacks since 2007, when
the city began requiring the payment option.  Today’s vote makes the fleet owners responsible for the
credit-card fees and requires drivers to pay owners an
additional $9 a day to defray the cost.  ‘Justice’ for Drivers  Drivers haven’t had an across-the-board boost since 2004,
when rates rose 26 percent. In 2006, the meter charge for cabs
in slow or standing traffic climbed to 40 cents per minute from
40 cents every two minutes. A 50-cent surcharge on all taxi
rides enacted in 2009 goes to the  Metropolitan Transportation
Authority , not to drivers or fleet owners.  “We’re very excited today that justice has been done,”
said Mohamed Bolouch, 52, a Moroccan immigrant and cab driver
for nine years. “We’re not trying to be rich millionaires.
We’re just trying to provide food for our children.”  Five of the commission’s nine members are selected by each
of the borough delegations in the City Council and four by Mayor
 Michael Bloomberg , who supported the fare increase.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
