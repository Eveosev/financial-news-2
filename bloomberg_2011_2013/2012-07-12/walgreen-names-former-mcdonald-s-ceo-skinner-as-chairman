Walgreen Co. (WAG)  named former  McDonald’s
Corp. (MCD)  Chief Executive Officer James Skinner nonexecutive
chairman as Al McNally steps down.  Skinner, who retired from McDonald’s last month, has served
on the drugstore chain’s board since 2005, Deerfield, Illinois-
based Walgreen said today in a statement. McNally, a former CEO
of Harris Bank, has served on Walgreen’s board since 1999 and
was non-executive chairman since 2009.  Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, has been making
acquisitions after losing customers when its contract to sell
prescriptions through  Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX)  ended last year.
Sales at stores open at least a year dropped 6.6 percent in the
fiscal-third quarter after  CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) ,  Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT)  and other drugstore rivals grabbed shoppers.  Walgreen last week agreed to buy the owner of the USA Drug
chain for about $438 million to add stores in the southern U.S.
and in June agreed to purchase a 45 percent stake in Alliance
Boots GmbH to expand globally.  Walgreen said Skinner, 67, took over as chairman as part of
the board’s rotation of directors. He ran McDonald’s, the
world’s largest restaurant company, since 2004. McNally, 66,
remains on Walgreen’s board.  Walgreen  rose  0.2 percent to $30 at 11:51 a.m. in  New York .
The shares dropped 9.4 percent this year through July 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
