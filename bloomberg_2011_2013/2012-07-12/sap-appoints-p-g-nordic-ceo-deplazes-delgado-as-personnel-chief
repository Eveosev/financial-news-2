SAP AG (SAP) , the world’s largest maker of
business-management software, named Luisa Deplazes Delgado,
 Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) ’s head of Nordic operations, to its
executive board as personnel chief.  Deplazes Delgado, 45, will start her new position at SAP’s
headquarters in Walldorf, Germany, in September, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  SAP, which had about 59,000 employees at the end of the
first quarter, has lacked a full-time personnel chief since
Angelika Dammann stepped down a year ago. Chief Financial
Officer Werner Brandt has been filling the role since Dammann’s
departure.  “With her international business and HR experience, Luisa
shares our commitment to inspiring and enabling people to run at
their best, while bringing a fresh perspective to our executive
team,” co-Chief Executive Officers  Bill McDermott  and Jim Hagemann Snabe said in the statement.  Deplazes Delgado is Swiss and speaks Reto-Romansh as a
mother tongue. She is also fluent in English, German, French,
Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. Deplazes Delgado studied law in
Geneva, at London’s King’s College and at the  London School of
Economics , SAP said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
