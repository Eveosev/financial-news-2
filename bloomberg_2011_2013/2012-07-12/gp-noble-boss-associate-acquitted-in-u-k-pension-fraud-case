Tony Morris, the co-founder of U.K.
finance firm Money Portal Plc, was found not guilty of stealing
52 million pounds ($80 million) from pension plans, the  Serious
Fraud Office  said.  Morris, whose company owned pension fund operator GP Noble
Trustees Ltd., and his associate Peter Malmstrom, were acquitted
today at a London criminal court, the SFO said in an e-mailed
statement. The men were on trial for about 11 weeks.  Morris was charged with stealing 30 million pounds from GP
Noble and its pension funds between July and August 2007, and 22
million pounds from GP Noble and BDC Trustees Ltd. in April
2008. The SFO alleged at trial that the money was spent on
luxuries including a 150,000-pound Aston Martin sports car.  Malmstrom was charged with  money laundering  for handling
6.95 million pounds of the funds allegedly stolen from pension
funds administered by GP Noble in 2007 and 2008.  In a previous trial, former GP Noble director Graham
Pitcher was convicted of conspiracy to defraud for misusing
pension plan funds managed by the company, the SFO said. He was
sentenced to eight years in prison.  Quentin Russell, a company adviser, was also convicted of
fraud and forgery offenses in another related trial and was
sentenced to 15 months in prison on January.  The cases, which ended last year, werenâ€™t public until
today because of U.K. reporting restrictions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
