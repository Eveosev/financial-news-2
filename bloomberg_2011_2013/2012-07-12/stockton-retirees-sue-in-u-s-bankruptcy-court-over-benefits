Some retirees from the bankrupt City
of Stockton,  California , filed a lawsuit asking a federal judge
for an injunction to stop the city from cutting off their health
benefits.  Shelley Green, Patricia Hernandez and other members of the
Association of Retired Employees of Stockton claim the city has
traditionally paid employees’ health-care premiums and extended
benefits to supplement Medicare for those over 65.  “Despite this promise,” Stockton officials plan “to
immediately terminate payment of health insurance premiums” for
many retirees, lawyers for the group said in a complaint filed
July 10 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Sacramento , California.  Stockton sought protection from creditors on June 28,
listing more than $1 billion in assets and more than $500
million in debt.  Before filing for bankruptcy, the city had announced it
would be cutting retiree benefits as part of its plan to balance
its budget.  The bankruptcy case is In re Stockton, 12-32118, and the
retirees lawsuit is In re Stockton 12-02302, both in U.S.
 Bankruptcy Court , Eastern District of California (Sacramento).  To contact the reporter on this story:
