Best Denki Co. (8175)  surged the most in
nine years in Tokyo trading after the Nikkei reported that
 Yamada Denki Co. (9831)  will spend more than 10 billion yen ($126
million) to boost its stake in the rival electronics retailer.  Best Denki rose as much as 19 percent to 183 yen, the
biggest gain since April 2003. Yamada Denki gained as much as
2.7 percent to 3,665 yen.  Yamada will raise its stake in the smaller retailer to more
than 50 percent from the current 7.5 percent, the Nikkei
reported. Best in April reported a 44 percent drop in profit for
the year ended Feb. 29 amid a decline in television sales.  The company will use the funds from Yamada to shut stores
and will remain a publicly traded company, according to the
report. Both companies, in statements to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, said they have nothing to disclose at this point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
