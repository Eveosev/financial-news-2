IRC Ltd. (1029) , the iron ore miner in Far
East Russia, posted a loss for the first half as prices fell and
it took a one-time charge on a titanium project.  The unit of gold miner  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  sold iron ore at
an average price of $127 a metric ton in the quarter ended June
30, 15 percent lower than a year earlier, IRC said today in a
statement on its unaudited financial results that didn’t give
the extent of the loss.  China, which accounted for 90 percent of IRC’s sales last
year, cut iron ore imports by 8.7 percent in June from the
previous month as a slowing economy reduced demand for the
commodity used by steelmakers. Iron ore prices may average $135
a ton in the third quarter and $140 in the final three months of
the year, according to Citigroup Inc.  The write down in titanium is “due to uncertainty
regarding the project’s future,” IRC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
