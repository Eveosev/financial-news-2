Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.’s biggest
household energy supplier, agreed to buy Iberdrola USA units
Energetix Inc. and NYSEG Solutions Inc. for $110 million to add
customers in the U.S. Northeast.  The purchase of Energetix, with 245,000 customers in New
York and  Pennsylvania , will bring Centrica’s New York consumers
to almost 500,000, the U.K. company said in a statement.  The Windsor-based utility, owner of the British Gas brand
in the U.K., is looking to expand in the U.S. through its Direct
Energy unit. The division has more than 1 million residential
and small business customers in the Northeast and operates in 46
U.S. states, Washington D.C. and  Canada . Centrica is also
seeking to double earnings from 2009 levels in five years.  The deal “supports Direct Energy’s strategy to grow and
add scale to its U.S. northeast downstream power and gas
position, particularly in the New York market,” Direct Energy
Chief Executive Officer  Chris Weston  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
