The ruble depreciated against the
dollar for the first day in three as oil,  Russia ’s main export,
declined.  The Russian currency lost 0.2 percent to 32.78 per dollar
by the 7 p.m. close in Moscow. The ruble gained 0.5 percent to
39.9301 per euro and was little changed at 35.9975 against the
central bank’s target dollar-euro basket.  Brent crude  lost 1.1 percent to $99.16 per barrel after the
 International Energy Agency  trimmed its oil-demand outlook for
this year and predicted “muted” growth in 2013. Oil and gas
together contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s state revenue,
according to the government’s estimates.  “The external backdrop is moderately negative, which
constrains the potential for improvement in the Russian
market,” analysts at OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender,
wrote in markets commentary on its website today.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing its at 33.3103 per dollar in three
months, compared with expectations of 33.255 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
