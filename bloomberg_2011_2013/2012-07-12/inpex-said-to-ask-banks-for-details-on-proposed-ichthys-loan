Inpex Corp. (1605)  is seeking more details
from banks on loan terms as it aims to borrow as much as $20
billion for the Ichthys liquefied natural gas project off
Western Australia, a person familiar with the matter said.  Japan’s largest energy explorer is making the inquiries
after banks provided proposals on potential financing by June
29, the person said, asking not to be identified because the
talks are private. Details such as margins, the loan structure
and the extent of export credit agency involvement haven’t been
decided, the person said.  Inpex and partner Total SA expect to start production on
the project at the end of 2016, Paris-based Total said in a
statement when the Ichthys LNG venture was approved in January.
Exports of LNG from  Australia  may triple within five years as
demand from China and developing economies increases, according
to a government report yesterday.  Inpex spokesman Keisuke Yano declined to comment when asked
about the negotiations with lenders. The company is looking for
more than 1 trillion yen ($12.6 billion) in project financing
and plans to sign a facility as early as October, with funds to
be made available in the first quarter of 2013, he said in June.  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  and  Mizuho Financial Group Inc. (8411)  are the
project’s financial advisers and will lead the marketing of the
loan to other lenders, another person familiar with the matter
said April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
