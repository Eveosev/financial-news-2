Chelsea captain  John Terry  will find
out tomorrow if he’s guilty of racially abusing a rival player
in a Premier League soccer game.  Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said he’ll render a judgment
tomorrow after defense and prosecution lawyers deliver closing
statements on the fourth day of a trial in  London .  Terry, 31, is accused of calling Queens Park Rangers
defender Anton Ferdinand a “f---ing black c---” during the
closing stages of a game at Loftus Road stadium on Oct. 23.  Terry denies the allegation, saying he repeated words he
thought Ferdinand, 27, had directed at him. Prosecutors say
Terry concocted the defense with teammate  Ashley Cole  after the
game to save his reputation. Cole isn’t accused of wrongdoing.  The England national team player, who is among the most
recognizable in soccer’s richest league, is fighting a charge of
a racially-aggravated public order offense for using
threatening, abusive or insulting words or behavior.  Terry was stripped of the England captaincy in February
after Riddle delayed the trial at Chelsea’s request. Fabio
Capello quit as the national team’s manager in February after
the Football Association stripped Terry of the job.  If convicted, Terry could be fined as much as 2,500 pounds
($3,900) and may face further sanctions from English soccer’s
governing body. Liverpool striker  Luis Suarez  received an eight-
game ban after being found guilty by a soccer tribunal of making
racist remarks to  Manchester United ’s Patrice Evra.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
