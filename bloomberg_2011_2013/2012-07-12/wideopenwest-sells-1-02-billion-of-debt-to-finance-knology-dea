WideOpenWest Finance LLC, a cable
television, high-speed Internet and telephone services provider,
raised $1.02 billion in a two-part bond offering to help fund
its takeover of  Knology Inc. (KNOL)   The Englewood, Colorado-based company owned by private-
equity firm Avista Capital Partners sold $725 million of 10.25
percent senior unsecured bonds due July 2019 to yield 928 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $295 million of
13.375 percent, senior subordinated notes maturing in October
2019 with a 12.77 percentage-point spread, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service rated the bonds Caa1, seven
levels below investment grade, and  Standard & Poor’s  graded them
an equivalent CCC+.  Proceeds will be used to fund the company’s acquisition of
the West Point, Georgia-based cable-television operator and
refinance existing debt, according to a person familiar with the
offering who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly about the sale.  WideOpenWest is also getting a $1.92 billion  term loan  to
help finance the takeover. The six-year debt is expected to be
priced at 95.75 cents to 96 cents on the dollar.  Average yields on U.S. bonds rated CCC and below have
dropped to 12.45 percent from 14.4 percent at year-end,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.  WideOpenWest is acquiring Knology for about $1.5 billion,
according to an April 18 statement distributed by  Business Wire .
Avista Capital bought WideOpenWest from Oak Hill Capital
Partners LP and ABRY Partners LLC for an undisclosed amount in
May 2006, Bloomberg data show.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada and SunTrust Banks
