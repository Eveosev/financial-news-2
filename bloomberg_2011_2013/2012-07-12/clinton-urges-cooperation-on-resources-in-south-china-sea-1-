U.S. Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  suggested joint development of energy resources in
disputed waters of the South China Sea in an approach that
contrasts with that of China.  She urged the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian
Nations and China to consider cooperative arrangements to
exploit hydrocarbon resources in the waters. The decision-making
process would be collaborative instead of dominated by China
alone, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to
speak publicly on the issue.  Measures “could include equitable joint exploration and
exploitation arrangements in areas of unresolved territorial
sovereignty,” Clinton said in comments to a regional security
summit. “The goal should be to find creative ways to provide an
endowment for future generations and to avoid unnecessary
conflict.”  China and four Asean nations have competing claims in the
 South China Sea . Vietnam and the Philippines reject China’s map
of the waters as a basis for joint development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
