     July 12 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  fell for a sixth day,
with the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average extending its longest losing
streak since April, as the Bank of  Japan ’s unexpected decision
to increase asset purchases failed to buoy investor sentiment.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender,
fell 1.8 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Asia ’s top carmaker by
market value, slid 1.8 percent as the yen rose.  Tokyo Electric
Power Co. (9501) , owner of the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant, fell to a record low after a report it will have to pay 1
trillion yen ($12.6 billion) in decontamination costs. Asahi
Glass Co. dropped 6.8 percent after cutting its operating profit
forecast.  The Nikkei 225 fell 1.5 percent to 8,720.01 at the close in
 Tokyo  after paring losses briefly on the BOJ’s decision. It was
the biggest drop since June 8. Volume was 20 percent above the
30-day average. The broader Topix Index lost 1.3 percent to
747.49, with almost four stocks falling for each that gained.  “The BOJ doesn’t want to do much quantitative easing, but
it’s going through the motions,” said Ichiro Takamatsu, a  fund
manager  at Tokyo-based Bayview Asset Management Co., which
oversees 150 billion yen ($1.9 billion) “The BOJ still did its
part because the market consensus was for no action.”  The Topix  rebounded  7.5 percent since June 4, when it
closed at its lowest since 1983, after euro leaders agreed to
ease bailouts for lenders and on optimism central banks around
the world will ease policy.  The gain has boosted the average price of shares on the
Japanese gauge to 0.9 times book value, compared with 2.1 times
for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 1.4 times for the Europe
Stoxx 600 Index. A number below one means investors can buy
companies for less than the value of their assets.  BOJ Action  The BOJ today expanded its asset-purchase fund to 45
trillion yen from 40 trillion yen while paring a loan facility
by 5 trillion yen, according to a policy statement released in
Tokyo today. Ten of 17 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had
predicted no further easing.  Banking shares extended losses after the central bank’s
move. Mitsubishi UFJ fell 1.8 percent to 379 yen.  Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest lender by
market value, dropped 2.1 percent to 2,546 yen.  Exporters slid as the yen strengthened after briefly
reversing gains against the dollar and euro. Toyota lost 1.8
percent to 3,025 yen.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the nation’s top exporter of
consumer electronics, dropped 2.4 percent to 999 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent
today. The equity gauge closed little changed in  New York 
yesterday, erasing losses in the final hour of trading as
investors sifted through minutes of a Federal Reserve meeting
for hints of additional stimulus.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 6.1 percent to 19.94,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.7 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  Tepco’s Bill  Tokyo Electric dropped 2.7 percent to 146 yen, a record low.
Japan will request that the utility will foot a 1 trillion yen
bill for decontamination costs for two years through March 2013,
Asahi reported, without citing anyone.  Asahi Glass  fell 6.8 percent to 483 yen, the second-biggest
drop on the Nikkei 225, after the company cut its forecast for
fiscal-year operating profit by 29 percent.  Among stocks that rose, Best Denki Co. surged 12 percent to
172 yen on a report Yamada Denki Co. will acquire the
electronics retailer. Yamada Denki slid 0.1 percent to 3,565 yen.  Shionogi & Co. rose 4.5 percent to 1,149 yen, leading gains
on the Nikkei 225. The shares advanced after the company’s
experimental drug beat the world’s best-selling treatment for
HIV in clinical trials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
