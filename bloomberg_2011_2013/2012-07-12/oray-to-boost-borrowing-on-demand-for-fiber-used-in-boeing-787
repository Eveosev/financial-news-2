Toray Industries Inc. (3402) , the supplier
of carbon-fiber for  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s 787 and Daimler AG’s Mercedes-
Benz, plans to increase borrowing this fiscal year to help fund
expansion.  The world’s largest producer of carbon-fiber will seek
 financing  of as much as 70 billion yen ($879 million) in the
year ending March 2013, from 60 billion yen in the previous
period, according to Mitsuharu Mano, the company’s general
manager at the finance department. Toray sold 20 billion yen of
10-year bonds today in its first offering of non-convertible
notes in nine years.  Demand for light-weight materials for cars and airplanes
will boost Toray’s  annual sales  to 2 trillion yen in about three
years, up 16 percent from the forecast for the current period,
the company said in May. The maker of  products  ranging from golf
club shafts and bathing suits to water purifiers and airbag
textiles plans to expand spending on factories and equipment 24
percent to 117 billion yen this fiscal year.  “Aggressive  capital spending  is at the center of our
current business plan,” Mano said in an interview at the
company’s Tokyo headquarters on July 10. “We need money to fund
expansion of facilities.”  Bond Sale  Toray today sold 20 billion yen of 0.925 percent 10-year
notes, according to a statement from SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  This was the first time the company tapped the market for a
straight bond since a 10 billion yen offering of 1.61 percent
10-year securities in September 2003, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Toray in April began a three-year 350 billion yen capital
spending plan aimed at boosting sales of carbon-fiber composites
and its mainstay synthetic fiber. It has  160.7 billion yen  of
bonds and loans outstanding, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company is building  South Korea ’s first carbon-fiber
plant and expanding production in the U.S.,  Japan  and France
facilities to help boost its global  output  capacity of the
material 50 percent to 27,100 tons by 2015. Operating profit in
the business will surge 56 percent to 12 billion yen this fiscal
year, accounting for 10 percent of its income, it said in May.  Shares of the company fell 0.2 percent to 521 yen as of
10:02 a.m. on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, extending their decline
this year to 5.4 percent. The  benchmark   Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
advanced 4.3 percent in the same period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
