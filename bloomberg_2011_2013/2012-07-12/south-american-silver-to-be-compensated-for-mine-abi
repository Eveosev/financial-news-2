South American Silver Corp. (SAC)  will
receive compensation for being stripped of its Bolivian silver
mining concession, state news agency ABI reported, citing the
country’s Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera.  Bolivia’s government, which on July 10 reached an agreement
with local communities to revoke the company’s Malku Khota
concession, is entitled to recover control of its resources, ABI
cited Garcia as saying. The government can finance the
exploration and development of the deposit located in the
southwestern Andes, it said.  South American Silver’s exploration Vice President Felipe Malbran said the company, which hasn’t been notified yet, was
willing to hold talks with the government, according to ABI.  The Vancouver-based company said yesterday it objects to
the Bolivian’s government’s decision and will pursue “all
legal, constitutional and diplomatic options.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
