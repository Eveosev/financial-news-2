Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, hired  Andrew Williams , a former
U.S. Treasury Department spokesman, for its corporate
communications unit, said two people familiar with the matter.  Williams, 39, who currently works for  General Electric Co. (GE) ,
will join New York-based Goldman Sachs as a vice president at
the end of the month, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because they weren’t authorized to comment publicly.
Williams will report to David Wells, head of U.S. media
relations, the people said. The Financial Times  reported  the
hiring earlier today.  Williams joins about four months after Goldman Sachs hired
Richard L. “Jake” Siewert, another former aide to U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, to take charge of
corporate communications. Before Williams joined Fairfield,
Connecticut-based GE, he worked for Geithner at Treasury and the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where Geithner was president.  Two former Goldman Sachs chief executive officers have
served as Treasury secretary and Geithner’s chief of staff, Mark Patterson, is a former Goldman Sachs lobbyist. The ties between
the firm and the government have led some to question whether
Goldman Sachs has too much influence on policy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
