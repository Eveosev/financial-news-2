Iran ’s oil-production costs will
more than quadruple in coming years,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  said.  The cost of producing each barrel will rise to $30 or more
from $7 currently, the newspaper said, citing citing Gholamreza
Manouchehri, an adviser to the head of National Iranian Oil Co.
He didn’t give a timeframe for the increase.  Iran currently allocates $20 billion a year to develop
fields and $10 billion on maintaining output, the report said.
In the next decade, maintaining production will cost $50
billion, with a similar sum required for development, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
