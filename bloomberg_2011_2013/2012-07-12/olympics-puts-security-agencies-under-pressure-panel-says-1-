The  Olympic Games  have placed
Britain’s security services under “severe pressure” due to the
volume of administration needed to tackle all possible terrorist
threats, according to the parliamentary panel that oversees the
intelligence agencies.  “The security service has reprioritized its work to enable
them to counter potential threats from al-Qaeda and its
affiliates; Republican dissidents; hostile states and others in
the run up to or during the games,” the Intelligence and
Security Committee said in its annual report released in  London 
today. “This, combined with the burden of the accreditation
process and related work, has placed the security service under
significant pressure over the past year.”  The report, which covers 2011-2012, said the threat level
for Northern Ireland-related terrorism is “severe” and
“substantial” in  Great Britain .  The most significant threat to the U.K. remains that from
al-Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups, and Northern Ireland-
linked terrorism, the committee said.  “Looking at the work of the intelligence community this
year, the ‘Arab Spring’ dominated,” the committee reported.
“It caught many by surprise and presented a real challenge to
the intelligence community which had to reprioritize quickly and
redirect its resources toward the region.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
