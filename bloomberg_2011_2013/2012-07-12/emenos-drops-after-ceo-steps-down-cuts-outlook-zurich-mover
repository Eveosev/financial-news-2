Temenos Group AG (TEMN) , the banking
software maker that retreated from a bid to buy Misys Plc, fell
the most in 3 1/2 years after Chief Executive Officer Guy
Dubois quit and the company cut its sales forecast.  Temenos plunged as much as 22 percent, the most since
January 2009, and was down 21 percent to 11.25 Swiss francs by
10:30 a.m. Zurich time, giving the Geneva-based company a market
value of about 810 million francs ($824 million). Temenos has
fallen 27 percent this year.  CEO Dubois is stepping down for personal reasons and will
be replaced by finance chief David Arnott, Temenos said
yesterday after markets closed. License revenues for the second
quarter plunged 37 percent to $24 million, and Temenos cut the
upper end of its sales growth forecast range to 1 percent from 6
percent for the full year.  The CEO’s resignation and the guidance cut “will not be
well received by markets and delivers a severe hit to an already
tarnished credibility,” Bank Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe
Bertschy, who has a buy rating on the stock, said in an e-mailed
note to clients. Temenos faces “a further worsening of the
environment,” he said.  Temenos terminated discussions with Misys in March on a
possible all-share merger. The U.K. competitor was purchased by
Vista Equity Partners LLC.  To contact the reporters on this story:
