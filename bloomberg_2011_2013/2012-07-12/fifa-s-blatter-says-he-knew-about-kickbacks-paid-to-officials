Sepp Blatter, president of soccer
ruling body FIFA, said today he knew about kickbacks paid to
officials of the organization.  Ex-FIFA President  Joao Havelange  and Ricardo Teixeira, a
former executive board member, received millions of dollars from
the ISL marketing agency, according to court documents released
yesterday.  Blatter said the payments were not illegal at the time.  He made his comments in an interview published by FIFA.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
