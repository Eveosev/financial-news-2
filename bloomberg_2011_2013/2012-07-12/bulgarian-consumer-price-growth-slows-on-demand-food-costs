Bulgarian inflation decelerated in
June as the euro-area’s debt crisis damped demand and a seasonal
abundance of fruits and vegetables cut food costs.  Consumer prices rose 1.6 percent from a year earlier,
compared with a 1.7 percent increase in May, the National
Statistics Institute in Sofia said in a statement today. Prices
fell 1 percent from May.  Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest country in terms of
economic output per capita, withstood the global recession in
2009 without an international bailout.  The country’s EU-harmonized inflation will ease to 2.6
percent on average in 2012 and 2.7 percent in 2013, the EU
forecast on May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
