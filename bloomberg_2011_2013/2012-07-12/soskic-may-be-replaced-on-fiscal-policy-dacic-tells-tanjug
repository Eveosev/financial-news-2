Serbia ’s central bank Governor Dejan Soskic may be replaced before his term in office ends in 2016 if
he doesn’t support the new government’s economic growth
policies,  Ivica Dacic , the designated prime minister, said in an
interview with state-run  Tanjug  newswire.  Soskic may lose his job if he acts in discord with other
state institutions, which will seek to stimulate growth rather
than “tighten the belt,” Dacic, who will be sworn in office
later this month, told Tanjug.  Dacic accused the nation’s 33 banks, 21 of which are owned
by foreign lenders, of siphoning assets abroad and “robbing the
people,” according to Tanjug.  “Someone should bear responsibility for the bad
situation,” Dacic said, commenting on reports that the new
government may replace Soskic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
