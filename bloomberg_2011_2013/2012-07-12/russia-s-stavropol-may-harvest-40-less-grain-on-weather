Russia’s Stavropol region, where
farmers reaped the country’s second-biggest grain crop last
year, may harvest 40 percent less grain this year.  The region’s agriculture ministry lowered its forecast from
a previous estimate of a 30 percent loss made last month because
of recent rains that followed drought and hampered harvesting,
it said today in a statement on its  website . Stavropol harvested
8.2 million metric tons of cereals last year, or 8.7 percent of
the national crop, according to the state statistics data.  Yields in Stavropol vary from 0.5 ton a hectare (2.47
acres) in some fields to 4.3 tons a hectare, the ministry said.
The average yield was 3.9 tons last year.  Russia will produce a national grain crop of 87 million
tons to 89 million tons this year, while the actual harvest is
seen at 85 million tons because factors including rains during
harvesting will prevent farmers from reaping the rest, Arkady Zlochevsky, president of the country’s Grain Union, said
yesterday at a news conference in Moscow.  The crop will be less than 80 million tons this year, Pavel Skurikhin, president of the Grain Producers’ Union, said today
at a news conference in Moscow. Russia harvested 94 million tons
of grain last year, according to the state statistics data.
Krasnodar was the biggest grain-growing region.  Wheat for September delivery rose 0.7 percent to $8.3225 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 10:43 a.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
