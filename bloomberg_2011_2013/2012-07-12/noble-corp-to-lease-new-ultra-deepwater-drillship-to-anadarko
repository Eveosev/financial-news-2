Noble Corp. (NE)  signed a three-year
contract to put its new ultra-deepwater drillship to work for
 Andarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  after the vessel is completed in the
fourth quarter of 2013.  The drillship may earn as much as $618,000 a day, including
a fee for moving the rig to its drilling location, Geneva-based
Noble said in a statement after the market closed today. The
Noble Bob Douglas rig, which will be able to operate in water as
deep as 10,000 feet (3,045 meters), is expected to work
primarily in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the company said.  It will have two blowout-prevention systems and is expected
to generate $677 million during the three-year contract,
according to the statement. The rate is “very good” for a
three-year contract,  Brian Uhlmer , an analyst at Global Hunter
Securities LLC in Houston, who rates the shares a buy and owns
none, said in a telephone interview.  Noble’s shares rose 0.2 percent to $33.32 in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
