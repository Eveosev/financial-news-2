Bulgaria doesn’t plan to tap foreign
debt markets in the coming years after it sold Eurobonds last
week and the  budget deficit  narrowed, Finance Minister  Simeon Djankov  said.  “We don’t need it,” Djankov told reporters in Vienna
today. “We don’t intend” to sell bonds abroad “for the next
couple of years.”  The Balkan country, which joined the European Union in
2007, raised 950 million euros ($1.16 billion) in five year
bonds last week, its first international borrowing in 11 years.
The country has the second-lowest level of public debt in the
27-nation bloc after  Estonia , at about 15 percent of gross
domestic product.  The economy will probably grow 1.4 percent this year, in
line with government projections, Djankov said. The expansion
will help cut the budget deficit below the targeted 1.3 percent
of GDP, he said.  Even as  Bulgaria , the EU’s poorest country measured by GDP
per capita, currently meets all conditions for adopting the
euro, the country will “not make any move” toward the
switchover in the next two years, Djankov said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
