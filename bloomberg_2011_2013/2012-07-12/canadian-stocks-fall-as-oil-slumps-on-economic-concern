Canadian stocks fell as banks and
commodity producers slumped amid concern the global economic
recovery is slowing down.  Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (CNQ)  and  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , two
of the nation’s largest energy providers, each declined 1.4
percent. Goldcorp Inc. lost 0.4 percent as the metal slipped on
the Comex for the third day. Royal Bank of Canada, the nation’s
largest lender, fell 1.2 percent. Bank and energy stocks were
the biggest drag on the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX) ,
with all 10 industries falling.  The S&P/TSX slumped 119.17 points, or 1 percent, to
11,425.47, after rising 0.3 percent yesterday. The benchmark
index has dropped 4.4 percent in 2012.  “You can see how sentiment is very negative right now,”
Jason Hornett, who co-manages C$250 million for Calgary-based
Bissett Investment Management, said in a phone interview.
“We’re going to feel the pain in energy and materials stocks
more than the U.S. equity indexes because we have more
exposure.”  Global equities fell amid further signs that the economic
recovery is faltering. Bank of America Corp. strategists reduced
earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies for this year and next,
citing  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing growth in China. Data
due tonight may show China’s economic growth fell below 8
percent for the first time since 2009, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  Royal Bank of Canada fell 1.2 percent to C$52.18. Toronto-
Dominion Bank, the second-largest, dropped 0.7 percent to
C$79.25. Bank of Nova Scotia slipped 1.4 percent to C$52.32.  Miners Slip  Goldcorp dropped 0.4 percent to C$33.68, falling for a
sixth day.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX)  retreated 1.4 percent to C$35.17
for a seventh straight session of declines, its longest losing
streak since March.  Eldorado Gold Corp. (ELD) , a Vancouver-based gold
miner with projects in Brazil, China, Turkey and Greece, slipped
3.4 percent to C$10.94.  Semafo Inc. (SMF) , a Quebec-based gold mining company with
projects in West Africa, plunged 22 percent to C$3.39, the most
since 2002, after the company announced an increase in reserves
and resources. Royal Bank of Canada analyst Jonathan Guy said
the update “fails to impress,” and BMO Capital Markets analyst
Andrew Breichmanas downgraded the stock from outperform to
perform.  Energy stocks declined as crude swung between gains and
losses, turning positive after the U.S. announced more sanctions
on Iran. Suncor slipped 1.4 percent to C$28.85. Canadian Natural
Resources lost 1.4 percent to C$26.10.  Calvalley Petroleum Inc. (CVI/A) , a company that explores for oil
and natural gas in Ethiopia and Yemen, tumbled 17 percent to
C$2.12 as DNO International ASA dropped its bid to purchase the
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
