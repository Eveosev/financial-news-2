Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite called on political parties to resist making pre-
election promises that they may struggle to keep as  Europe ’s
debt crisis threatens the Baltic nation’s economy.  The next government must keep the  budget deficit  within 3
percent of  gross domestic product , Grybauskaite told a news
conference today in the capital, Vilnius. Still, “careful and
gradual” increases in public wages may be possible as GDP grows
at the European Union’s second-fastest pace, she added.  “We’ll have an interesting yet complicated period that
requires responsible actions from politicians and an awareness
of events surrounding  Lithuania ,” Grybauskaite said. “We need
people to be dubious over empty promises” in the election
campaign “because there are neither possibilities nor the money
for them.”  Lithuanians go to the polls Oct. 14 to elect a new
parliament. The Homeland Union party of Prime Minister Andrius
Kubilius, who pushed through austerity measures totaling 15
percent of GDP in 2009-2010, has 8.5 percent support and trails
three opposition parties, according to a survey by Spinter
Tyrimai for the Delfi online news service published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
