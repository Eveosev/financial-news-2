India ’s rupee weakened for a second
day after the nation’s second-largest software exporter cut its
sales forecast on slowing global growth.  Infosys Ltd. (INFO)  today said sales in the year ending March 31,
2013, may be $7.34 billion, lower than the $7.55 billion
forecast in April. South Korea lowered borrowing costs today for
the first time in more than three years and Australian employers
unexpectedly cut payrolls as Europe’s debt crisis damps growth
in Asia. The currency briefly pared losses after a report showed
India’s factory output in May rose more than economists
estimated.  “Foreign investors will now look at what reforms will be
announced to support growth and inflows,” said  Paresh Nayar ,
head of money-market and currency trading at  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) , a
unit of South Africa’s second-largest trading group. The dollar-
rupee pair will face resistance at 56, he said.  The rupee dropped 0.5 percent to 55.9250 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, fell 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point,
to 12 percent.  Industrial production  rose 2.4 percent in May from a year
earlier, after a revised 0.9 percent contraction in April, the
 Central Statistical Office  said in a statement in  New Delhi 
today. The median of 35 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 1.8 percent advance.  Rate Cuts Delayed  Indications of better growth in India may delay further
interest-rate cuts from its central bank, according to Credit
Agricole CIB. The  Reserve Bank  of India, which next reviews
policy on July 31, kept the benchmark  repurchase rate  unchanged
at 8 percent in June after lowering it by 50 basis points in
April.  Wholesale prices  rose 7.61 percent last month, according
to another Bloomberg News survey before data due July 16,
compared with 7.55 percent in May.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.82 per
dollar, compared with 56.37 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.82 from 56.33. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
