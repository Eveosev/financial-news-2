Calvalley Petroleum Inc. (CVI/A) , a company
that explores for oil and natural gas in Ethiopia and Yemen,
fell the most in more than four months after  DNO International
ASA (DNO)  dropped its bid to buy the company.  Calvalley  fell  17 percent to C$2.12 at the close in
Toronto, the most since Feb. 14.  DNO said today it won’t proceed with its all-cash bid to
buy Calvalley at C$2.30 for each Class A share, or about C$216.9
million. Calvalley’s board is considering it options after a
partner in its Yemen project announced the potential sale of a
25 percent stake, said Oslo-based DNO, which announced its offer
on July 5.  Calvalley said late yesterday it was forming a special
committee to explore strategic alternatives and its board has
adopted a so-called poison pill to protect against unsolicited
takeover bids.  To contact the reporter on this story:
