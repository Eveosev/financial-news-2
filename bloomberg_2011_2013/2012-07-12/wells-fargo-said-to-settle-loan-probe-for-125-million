Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , the largest U.S.
mortgage lender, will pay $125 million to settle federal claims
it violated fair-lending laws, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the agreement.  The case relates to independent mortgage brokers who worked
with the bank, said a person with knowledge of the inquiry who
requested anonymity because the accord hasnâ€™t been made public.
The deal may be announced as early as today.  Mary Eshet , a spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based
lender, and Mitchell Rivard, a Justice Department spokesman,
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
