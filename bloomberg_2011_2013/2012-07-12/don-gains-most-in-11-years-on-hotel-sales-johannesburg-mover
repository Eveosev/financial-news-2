The Don Group Ltd. (DON)  catapulted the
most in almost 11 years after saying it sold three of its nine
hotels for 77.5 million rand ($9.3 million) as it exits the
travel and leisure industry.  The stock surged as much as 70 percent, the biggest leap
since August 2001, to 17 cents and traded at 15 cents by 12:25
p.m. Johannesburg, increasing the company’s market value to 44.2
million rand. More than 1.4 million shares changed hands, almost
35 times the three-month daily average.  Overcapacity in the market after more hotels were built
ahead of the 2010 Soccer  World Cup  in  South Africa  made it
difficult for smaller groups to make a profit, Anthony Clark, an
analyst at Vunani Securities, said by phone from  Cape Town .  “The hotel market has changed,” Clark said. “The only
way to make money as a shareholder is to force Don to break up,
which is exactly what it is doing.”  Proceeds from the sales will be used to reduce interest-
bearing long-term debt, the group said in a statement late
yesterday. Its remaining six hotels will also be sold as it
moves away from owning and operating hotels.  “The company is a liquidation plan on the asset value,”
Clark said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
