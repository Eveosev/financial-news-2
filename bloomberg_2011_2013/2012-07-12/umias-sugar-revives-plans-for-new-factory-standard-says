     July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Mumias Sugar Co. Ltd. revived plans
to build a plant in the Tana Delta at the  Kenyan  coast after the
project stalled six years ago, the Standard reported.  The project, which is being done with the state-run Tana
and Athi Rivers Development Authority, requires $400 million and
will be funded through debt and equity, the Nairobi-based
newspaper said, citing Mumias Managing Director Peter Kebati.  To contact the reporter on this story:
