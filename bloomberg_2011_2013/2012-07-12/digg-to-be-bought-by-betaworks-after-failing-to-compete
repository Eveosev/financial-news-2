Digg Inc., a seven-year-old social-
media company that struggled to compete with  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and
Twitter Inc., will be acquired by Betaworks, a  New York 
technology-investment company.  Digg will merge with News.me, a startup funded by Betaworks
that makes applications for the iPhone and iPad, Chief Executive
Officer Matt Williams said today in a  blog posting . Williams
plans to leave the company to become an entrepreneur in
residence at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz after the
transaction is complete.  The startup raised about $40 million in venture funding
from investors such as Greylock Partners and Highland Capital
Partners.  Marc Andreessen , a founder of Andreessen Horowitz,
also invested. While Digg helped pioneer features that let
 Internet users  share news stories with friends, the backers
never saw a payoff. Betaworks is acquiring Diggâ€™s assets for
$500,000, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Williams, who became CEO in 2010, cut the workforce by 37
percent that year in a bid to make the San Francisco-based
company profitable by 2011. Digg also revamped its site to add
more social and personalization features. Still, it failed to
keep up with the popularity of Facebook and Twitter.  Digg will live on in a version that complements the News.me
iPhone and iPad apps, Williams said.  Bloomberg L.P., the parent of Bloomberg News, has invested
in Andreessen Horowitz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
