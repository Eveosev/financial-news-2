Europe ’s highest-rated government
bonds rose, with German two-year yields falling to a record
minus 0.042 percent, as the  European Central Bank  said  overnight
deposits  from financial firms slid as it ended paying interest.  Yields on Austrian, Belgian, French and Dutch securities
also fell to all-time lows as banks sought higher returns than
they could get from the ECB or from German notes. So-called core
bonds extended gains as the ECB said in its monthly bulletin
that some of the risks to the economic outlook it warned about
had materialized. Italian bonds dropped as the nation sold one-
year bills and prepared to auction securities due between 2015
and 2023 tomorrow.  “Investors are being forced into the front-end of euro
curves,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at
Monument Securities Ltd. in  London , referring to the region’s
shorter-maturity debt. “They’re chasing the likes of Austria
and  France , which offer a small return.”  The German  two-year  yield declined two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to minus 0.039 percent at 4:27 p.m.
London time. The zero percent note due June 2014 rose 0.045, or
45 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,219) face amount, to 100.075.  The 10-year bund yield fell two basis points to 1.25
percent, after reaching 1.235 percent, the  lowest  since June 6.  Deposits Slide  German  borrowing costs  have slid to record lows as the debt
crisis, now in its third year, drives investors to the region’s
safest assets. The nation sold 10-year bonds yesterday at an
average yield of 1.31 percent, an all-time low. It plans to
auction 5 billion euros of two-year notes on July 18.  Banks in the 17-nation euro region deposited 324.9 billion
euros at the ECB last night, down from 808.5 billion euros the
previous day, the Frankfurt-based central bank said. That’s the
least since Dec. 21. Policy makers reduced the  main refinancing
rate  to a record 0.75 percent on July 5 and cut the deposit rate
to zero to stimulate credit supply and lending.  “The ECB didn’t like the amount of deposits it was
seeing,” Monument Securities’ Ostwald said. “By cutting the
deposit rate to zero, they’re forcing some of the smaller banks
to take more risk.”  French five-year  yields fell three basis points to 0.93
percent after reaching a record 0.888 percent. Austrian two-year
 yields  dropped as much as seven basis points to 0.043 percent.
Belgian 10-year yields tumbled as much as 11 basis points to
2.644 percent, while  Dutch two-year  yields declined to 0.009
percent, both records.  ‘Remain Weak’  “Inflationary pressure over the policy-relevant horizon
has been dampened further as some of the previously identified
downside risks to the euro-area growth outlook have
materialized,” the Frankfurt-based ECB said today in its
monthly bulletin today. “Economic growth in the euro area
continues to remain weak.”  The Italian Treasury sold 7.5 billion euros of 361-day
bills at an average yield of 2.697 percent. That compares with
3.972 percent at an auction of similar-maturity securities on
June 13.  Italy’s  two-year  note yield climbed five basis points to
3.79 percent, and the rate on similar-maturity Spanish debt
increased three basis points to 4.47 percent.  Volatility on French government debt was the highest in
euro-area markets today, followed by Belgium and  Finland ,
according to measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-
and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  The difference in yield, or  spread , between German two-year
notes and 10-year bunds may shrink to the narrowest in almost
seven weeks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, based on
technical indicators.  The spread, currently at 129 basis points, is below its 50-
day moving average of 136 basis points and may target the June 1
low of 113 basis points, the data show.  German debt has returned 3.8 percent this year, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French debt returned 6.6 percent,
and Spanish securities lost 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
