The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 0.7 percent to 608.31 at 4:53 p.m.
 Singapore  time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials
fell 0.4 percent to 1507.5.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell in  New York  on concern global demand will falter
after  South Korea  unexpectedly cut  interest rates ,  Australia ’s
jobless rate rose and economists said European manufacturing
stagnated last month.  Crude for August delivery declined as much as 68 cents to
$85.13 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was at $85.19 at 3:15 p.m. Singapore time. The
contract yesterday climbed $1.90 to $85.81, the highest close
since July 9. Prices have decreased 14 percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  OIL PRODUCTS  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell $1.05 to $17.15 a barrel at 11:45 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This
crack spread, a measure of processing profit, narrowed the most
since March 19.  High-sulfur  fuel oil  was down 57 cents at $2.07 a barrel
below Dubai crude, according to PVM. That’s the biggest discount
since June 5, indicating widening losses for refiners turning
crude into residual products.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold for immediate delivery lost 0.5 percent to $1,568.27
an ounce by 9:15 a.m. in London. It dropped as much as 0.7
percent to $1,564.63, the lowest since June 29. August-delivery
gold fell 0.5 percent to $1,568.10 an ounce on the Comex in New
York.  BASE METALS  Copper dropped after the minutes of Federal Open Market
Committee’s meeting in June disappointed investors looking for
additional stimulus from the U.S. central bank, hurting the
outlook for demand. Zinc and lead fell.  The metal for delivery in three months lost as much as 0.3
percent to $7,514.50 a metric ton on the  London  Metal Exchange,
before trading at $7,517.50 at 3:32 p.m. in  Shanghai . September
futures on the Comex fell 1 percent to $3.412 a pound.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  December-delivery corn increased as much as 1.9 percent to
$7.1725 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade before trading at
$7.135 at 3:13 p.m. in Singapore. Prices have surged 41 percent
since mid-June as U.S. crops withered under dry, hot weather.  Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.5 percent to $15.145
a bushel. The most-active contract jumped yesterday by as much
as 2.4 percent to $15.75, the highest price since July 2008.  Wheat for September delivery was little changed at $8.265 a
bushel, after reaching $8.485 yesterday, the highest level for
the most-active contract since April 27, 2011. The price has
jumped 28 percent since the end of May, partly because of dry
weather in parts of Russia and Ukraine.  December-delivery rubber gained as much as 1.2 percent to
247.3 yen ($3,118 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange
before settling at 246.3 yen. That pared this year’s loss for
the most-active contract to 6.5 percent.  Palm oil  fell the most in almost a month on concern that a
global economic slowdown will reduce demand for food and fuel as
signaled by declining exports from  Malaysia , the world’s second-
largest grower.  To contact the reporter on this story:
