The European Commission said it’s
seeking views on additional concessions offered by  Thomson
Reuters  Corp. in a bid to settle an antitrust probe over its
securities identification codes.  The Brussels-based commission  published a summary  of the
concessions offer on its website, inviting public comment on it
for the next four weeks. Should this so-called market test be
successful, the commitments will be made binding.  The European Commission opened an investigation into the
Thomson Reuters codes in 2009, saying customers may potentially
be locked in to working with the company because replacing the
codes required “a long and costly procedure” to rewrite or
reconfigure software applications.  Thomson Reuters made the revised offer after an earlier
attempt to end the case failed to satisfy EU demands to make it
easier for customers to switch suppliers of market data.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
Thomson Reuters in selling financial and legal information and
trading systems.  To contact the reporters on this story:
