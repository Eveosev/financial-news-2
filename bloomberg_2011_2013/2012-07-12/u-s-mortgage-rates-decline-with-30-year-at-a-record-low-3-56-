U.S. mortgage rates dropped, with
30-year loans reaching a record low for a fourth straight week,
amid signs of improvement in the housing market.  The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 3.56
percent in the week ended today, the lowest in Freddie Mac
records dating to 1971, from 3.62 percent. The average 15-year
rate dropped to 2.86 percent, also a record, from 2.89 percent,
the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-finance company said today
in a statement.  Rising home sales and a slowing decline in prices has
relieved some strains on the U.S. housing market. The number of
homes with loans for more than the properties are worth fell in
the first quarter to 11.4 million, or almost 24 percent of all
homes with a mortgage, from 12.1 million, or more than 25
percent, in the fourth quarter of last year, according to a
report today by data provider  CoreLogic Inc. (CLGX)   “We do have a little bit of a firmer housing market,”
 Keith Gumbinger , a vice president of HSH.com, a mortgage-
information website based in Pompton Plains,  New Jersey , said
yesterday in a telephone interview. “I don’t think anyone would
call it wonderful, but it has improved, or stabilized, over the
last few months.”  Contracts to buy previously owned homes rose 5.9 percent
last month, matching a two-year high reached in March, the
National Association of Realtors reported June 27. Purchases of
new U.S. houses rose in May to a two-year high, the Commerce
Department said June 25.  Home-loan applications declined in the period ended July 6
for a fourth straight week, according to the  Mortgage Bankers
Association . A measure of  refinancing  dropped 3.4 percent from
the prior week, while the  purchase  gauge climbed 3.3 percent,
the Washington-based group said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
