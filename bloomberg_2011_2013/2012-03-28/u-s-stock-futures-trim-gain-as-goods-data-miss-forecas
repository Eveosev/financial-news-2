U.S. stock-index futures trimmed
gains after government data showed orders for durable goods
increased less than estimated in February.   Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
advanced 2.2 percent, less than projected after a revised 3.6
percent decline the prior month, data from the Commerce
Department showed. Economists forecast a 3 percent gain,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
rose less than 0.1 percent to 1,407.2 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York 
after earlier increasing as much as 0.4 percent.  The  S&P 500  climbed 12 percent from the end of last year
through yesterday, poised for the best  first quarter  since 1998,
amid better-than-forecast earnings and economic data. Technology
and financial shares rose the most among 10 groups, surging more
than 21 percent so far in 2012.  U.S. stocks retreated yesterday as a report showing
American  consumer confidence  near the strongest level in a year
failed to encourage investors after the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index advanced to an almost four-year high.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
