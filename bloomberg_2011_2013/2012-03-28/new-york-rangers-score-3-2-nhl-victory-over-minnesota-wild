Ruslan Fedotenko scored on a 15-
foot wrist shot to give the  New York Rangers  a 3-2 victory
against the  Minnesota Wild  in the National Hockey League.  The Rangers (48-21-7) have 103 points, three more in the
Atlantic Division than the Pittsburgh Penguins, who lost 5-3 at
home last night to the New York Islanders. The Rangers lead the
Eastern Conference by 10 points over the second-seeded  Boston
Bruins , who are atop the Northeast Division. The top three
places in the conference are automatically held by division
leaders.  Brian Boyle gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead in the first period
last night at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, Minnesota.  Kyle Brodziak tied the score 1-1 on a power play early in
the second period. Marian Gaborik’s 38th goal of the season
restored the Rangers’ lead five minutes later before Mikko Koivu
tied it 2-2 with a power-play goal.  Fedotenko scored the decisive goal with less than seven
minutes left in the third period.  Minnesota  (31-35-10) has 72 points in the Western
Conference and has been eliminated from playoff contention.  To contact the reporter on this story:
