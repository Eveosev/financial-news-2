San Miguel Corp. (SMC) , the  Philippines ’
 biggest company , reported 2011 profit that beat analyst
estimates amid acquisitions in energy and infrastructure.  Net income  declined 13 percent to 17.5 billion pesos ($407
million), the company said yesterday. That exceeded the 16.2
billion-peso average of five analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  The brewer  founded  in 1890 expanded into businesses such as
power retailing, oil refining and infrastructure to boost its
profitability by more than half and reduced reliance on beverage
operations. Refiner Petron Corp., whose control  San Miguel 
 bought  in 2010, will become a flagship and the single biggest
source of revenue in 2011, San Miguel President Ramon Ang said
last year.  Sales more than doubled to 536 billion pesos last year,
from 246 billion pesos, helped by contributions from new
businesses including  Petron (PCOR)  and SMC Global Power Holdings Corp.,
the company said yesterday. That missed the 563 billion-peso
average of five analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Operating profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and
administrative expenses, rose 62 percent to 56 billion pesos,
San Miguel said.  Net income  excluding one-time gains and charges
climbed 36 percent to 17.3 billion pesos.  Esso Malaysia, Thailand  “It will take time before we see a normal profit picture
for San Miguel,” said Astro del Castillo, managing director at
Manila-based First Grade Finance Inc. “The company has made
lots of acquisitions that will take some time to be reflected in
the bottom line.”  Assets were 890.5 billion pesos in 2011 and the company had
129 billion pesos in cash, San Miguel said in a presentation
yesterday.  Net income at Petron, the Philippines’ biggest oil company,
rose 7.6 percent to 8.5 billion pesos in 2011, and revenue
gained 20 percent to 274 billion pesos, it said March 7.  Petron plans to invest 8 billion pesos to double the
capacity of a 70-megawatt plant that runs the refiner, President
Eric Recto told reporters yesterday. The company, which will
complete the purchase of 65 percent of Esso Malaysia Bhd this
month, is open to buying into Esso Thailand Pcl if an
“opportunity comes,” Recto said.  Power, Telecommunications  San Miguel also owns part of  Manila Electric Co. (MER) , the
Philippines’ largest power retailer, and stakes in
telecommunications and mining operations. Manila Electric’s 2011
net income rose 37 percent to 13.2 billion pesos and revenue
increased 6.6 percent to 257 billion pesos, the company said in
presentation materials posted on its website last month.  San Miguel expanded its  operating margin , the percentage of
revenue left after taking away the cost of sales and general
expenses, to 14.1 percent in 2010, from 8.8 percent in 2008,
after acquiring diversifying its operations, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The company and  Indonesia ’s Citra Group agreed to buy
controlling stakes in operators of a toll road linking Manila to
provinces in the south of Luzon. Last August, San Miguel agreed
to buy three Exxon Mobil Corp. units in  Malaysia  for $610
million in its first purchase of overseas oil assets.  San Miguel is in discussions to buy a stake in Philippine
Airlines Inc., President Ang said last month. The carrier
expects to get $500 million for the 49 percent stake that San
Miguel offered to buy, people familiar said last month.  San Miguel has announced or completed at least 17
 acquisitions  with a combined value of $1.9 billion in the past
three years, according to data on the Bloomberg. The company
plans to invest more than $4 billion in a bid to almost double
revenue to 1 trillion pesos by 2016, Ang said in February last
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
