Colombia  will consider oil
pipeline, exploration and production ventures for state-run
 Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  with Venezuela as the two nations strengthen ties.  Colombian Mines and Energy Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  and
Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez will discuss a possible
oil pipeline linking Colombia’s Pacific coast with Venezuela at
a meeting today in the port city of Cartagena, northern
Colombia.  The meeting is of ’’strategic importance for Colombian-
Venezuela relations,’’ Cardenas said in an e-mailed statement.  Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has sought to
improve ties with President Hugo Chavez since taking office in
2010 by reviving trade, renewing accords to supply electricity
and natural gas and considering ventures with Ecopetrol in
Venezuela. Relations between the countries deteriorated during
the prior administration of President  Alvaro Uribe , who accused
Venezuela of harboring Colombian rebels. Chavez has denied the
claims.  The neighboring countries also are considering a project to
carry Venezuelan natural gas through Colombia to Central
America, according to the statement.  Ecopetrol, Colombia’s largest oil company, has increased
production by investing in new fields, while output growth at
state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA has stagnated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
