Bank of America Corp. , the second-
biggest U.S. lender, said Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan ’s 2011 compensation package was $7 million for 2011, a
30 percent cut, as the company’s stock slumped.  The CEO’s salary was unchanged at $950,000, with the rest
of his package consisting of $1.82 million in “cash-settled
restricted stock units” and $4.24 million of restricted stock
units tied to performance, according to a regulatory  filing 
yesterday. A separate calculation conforming to U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission standards showed Moynihan’s compensation
quadrupled to $8.09 million.  Moynihan, 52, spent his second year as CEO selling more
than $33 billion in assets and targeting $8 billion of cost
savings as revenue stagnated. Profit rebounded to $1.4 billion
in 2011 from a $2.2 billion loss a year earlier, and capital
levels rose in the fourth quarter. The stock plunged 58 percent
last year, the worst in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average . This
year, it’s leading the benchmark with a 75 percent gain.  “For 2011, the committee considered Mr. Moynihan’s
leadership and execution against our company’s strategic plan,
in light of the challenges facing our industry,” the lender
said in the filing. “Under Mr. Moynihan’s direction, our
company continued to strengthen its  balance sheet  in key risk
areas by improving capital and overall liquidity.”  Bank of America’s board also noted Moynihan’s cost-cutting
effort, known as Project New BAC, which seeks to trim as much as
$8 billion in expenses and at least 30,000 jobs at the
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based firm.  Timing of Payments  The bank’s  top executives  get most of their 2011
compensation in share units to be paid in the future if they
meet performance targets. While Moynihan got no cash bonus for a
third year, some of his deputies received such awards. Cash-
settled restricted stock units vest and pay monthly over 12
months through March 2013, according to the filing.  Moynihan’s pay increased in 2011 under SEC guidelines
because of differences from the bank’s method on the timing of
compensation tied to equity grants. The agency’s total also
included changes in pension plans and perks such as $385,614 for
use of corporate aircraft.  Moynihan simplified the firm’s management structure last
year by naming Thomas K. Montag and David Darnell co-chief
operating officers and ousting division heads  Sallie Krawcheck 
and  Joseph Price .  Montag, who oversees global investment and commercial
banking and trading divisions, earned $12 million, according to
the bank’s table of 2011 compensation decisions. The sum was
$14.3 million by the SEC method of accounting, compared with
$831,248 the previous year.  Darnell, Thompson  Darnell, who oversees retail units including deposits,
 wealth management , credit cards and home loans, had his
compensation listed at $8 million according to the bank’s
calculation. Bruce R. Thompson, promoted to chief financial
officer from risk chief in the middle of last year, earned $10
million, while Charles H. Noski, who became vice chairman after
Thompson replaced him as CFO, was awarded $4.25 million.  The firm’s board will shrink to 12 members after D.  Paul
Jones  doesn’t seek re-election at the company’s annual investor
meeting in May. Jones, 69, was among four new directors in June
2009 when  Kenneth D. Lewis , CEO at the time, revamped the board
amid pressure from regulators.  To contact the reporter on this story:
