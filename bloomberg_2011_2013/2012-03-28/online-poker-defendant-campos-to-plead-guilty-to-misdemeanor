Former SunFirst Bank official John
Campos, charged with processing payments for illegal Internet
poker sites, will plead guilty to a misdemeanor banking charge
today, his lawyer said.  Frederick Hafetz  said Campos, who prosecutors say is a
former part-owner and vice chairman of the  St. George , Utah,
bank, will enter his guilty plea in a hearing in Manhattan
federal court today.  In a plea agreement, Campos and federal prosecutors agreed
that federal sentencing guidelines call for him to receive from
zero and six months in prison, Hafetz said. U.S. District Judge
 Lewis Kaplan , who is presiding over the case, is free to
disregard the guidelines, which arenâ€™t binding.  Campos is one of 11 people charged last April along with
the founders of Pokerstars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker.
Prosecutors from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
Manhattan claim the three companies illegally circumvented a
2006 law that bars banks from processing payments to offshore
gambling websites.  The case is U.S. v. Tzvetkoff, 10-CR-00336, Southern
District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
