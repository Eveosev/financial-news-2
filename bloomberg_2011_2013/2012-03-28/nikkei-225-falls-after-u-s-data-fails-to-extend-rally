Japanese  shares  fell as U.S.
consumer confidence near its strongest level in a year failed to
spur buying after the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average gained the most
in six months yesterday. Sharp Corp. jumped after Foxconn
Technology Group agreed to buy a stake in the display maker.  Nippon Kayaku Co. slumped 3 percent after the chemical
maker’s profit fell.  Tokyu Corp. (9005) , a rail and bus company, slid
1.4 percent after announcing an operating-profit target that
missed Deutsche Bank AG’s estimate. Shares of Sharp surged by
the daily limit in  Tokyo , jumping 16 percent at the close.  The Nikkei 225 dropped 0.7 percent to 10,182.57 at the 3
p.m. close in Tokyo after yesterday gaining 2.4 percent, its
biggest advance since Sept. 27. Trading volume on the gauge
today was 16 percent below the 30-day average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The broader Topix Index slid 0.9 percent
to 864.43 after the expiration of a deadline yesterday to buy
shares and still get a dividend for about four-fifths of the
companies on the gauge.  “There are concerns the market has risen too much,” said
Naoteru Teraoka, general manager at Tokyo-based Chuo Mitsui
Asset Management Co., which oversees about $27.6 billion.
Investors are setting the bar higher for U.S. economic reports,
he said.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The gauge dropped 0.3 percent in  New York 
yesterday even as a key consumer confidence index held close to
the highest level in a year, and a measure of property values in
20 cities fell at a slower pace in January.  ‘Mixed Data’  “U.S. data overnight were mixed,” said  Tim Schroeders ,
who helps manage $1 billion in equities at Pengana Capital Ltd.
in  Melbourne . “We are in a consolidation phase after markets
put on some pretty good gains, particularly in  Japan .”  The Nikkei 225 yesterday erased losses since the country’s
record earthquake on March 11 last year as the declining yen and
$241 billion of reconstruction spending helped make it the best-
performing benchmark index in the developed world this year.
Shares in the gauge are valued at 1.3 times book value on
average, compared with 2.3 times for the S&P 500 and 1.5 times
for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Nippon Kayaku slid 3 percent to 837 yen today after saying
its operating profit for the nine months ended Feb. 29 fell 14
percent from a year earlier as sales slowed and research and
development costs increased.  Tokyu Target  Tokyu fell 1.4 percent to 398 yen. The company targeted
operating profit of 55 billion yen ($664 million) for the year
ended March 31, 2014, short of a 71 billion yen estimate by
Seigo Ando, a Tokyo-based analyst at Deutsche Bank.  Sharp rallied 16 percent to 570 yen after Foxconn
Technology and founder Terry Gou agreed to invest 133 billion
yen in the TV maker and its display unit. The deal is the
largest Japanese investment by a Taiwanese buyer and includes an
agreement for the Apple Inc. supplier to purchase as much as 50
percent of Sharp Display Products Corp.’s liquid-crystal-display
panels.  The  Nikkei 225 Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 2.8 percent to 19.68,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.6 percent on the
benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
