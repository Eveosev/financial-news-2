Slovenia may have to pay damages of
as much as 300 million euros ($400 million) to  Alstom SA (ALO)  of
France if the government doesnâ€™t provide guarantees for the
upgrade of a thermal power plant, Finance newspaper  reported .  Slovenia should provide guarantees of 440 million euros by
May 20 for the project in Termoelektrarna Sostanj d.o.o.,
otherwise Alstom, which is providing the equipment for the
upgrade, will stop all work at the plant, the Ljubljana-based
newspaper said, without saying where it obtained the
information.  The 1.2 billion-euro project has already been delayed since
October, when the previous government of Prime Minister  Borut Pahor  was ousted and now it is up to the new administration of
premier  Janez Jansa  to decide on the guarantees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
