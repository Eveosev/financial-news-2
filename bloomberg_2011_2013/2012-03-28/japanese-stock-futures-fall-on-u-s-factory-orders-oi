Japanese  stock   futures  and
Australian equities fell after orders placed with U.S. factories
for durable goods rose less than economists estimated and  oil
prices  dropped, damping demand for riskier assets.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , Asia’s
biggest carmaker by market value that gets 28 percent of its
revenue in  North America , fell 1.1 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. ADRs of  Sharp Corp. (6753) , a Japanese
electronics maker, surged 14 percent after the shares rose by
their daily limit yesterday on an investment plan by Foxconn
Technology Group.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s biggest oil
producer, slid 1.3 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
June closed at 10,130 in Chicago yesterday, down from 10,180 in
Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,120 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.3
percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index added 0.1 percent in
Wellington.  “With all the good news being factored in, we are coming
to a tougher period and markets are vulnerable to any bad
news,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “We are starting to see data come out
on the softer side of what’s expected. On its own, the durable
goods data is still consistent with the economic growth in the
U.S.”  Durable Goods  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  were little
changed today. The index lost 0.5 percent in New York yesterday
after a report showed that factory bookings for goods meant to
last at least three years advanced 2.2 percent in February, less
than projected after a revised 3.6 percent decline in January.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said unemployment
remains too high, the economic recovery isn’t guaranteed and
policy makers don’t rule out any further options to spur growth.  Stocks also fell after crude oil for May delivery slumped
1.8 percent to $105.41 yesterday in New York, the lowest close
since March 22.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 11.8 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 11.8 percent increase by the
S&P 500 and an 8 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 15 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500
and 11.1 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese equities traded in the U.S. sank to the lowest
level in three weeks on concern a slowdown in the world’s
second-largest economy is eroding profits. The Bloomberg China-
US Equity Index of the most-traded Chinese shares in the U.S.
slid 2 percent to 103.34 yesterday in New York, the weakest
close since March 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
