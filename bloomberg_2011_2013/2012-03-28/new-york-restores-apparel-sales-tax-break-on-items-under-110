Those shoes you’ve been eyeing at
 DSW Inc. (DSW)  will cost you less starting April 1 when New York state
raises the  sales-tax exemption  to $110 for clothing and footwear
purchases.  Shoppers will get a break from the 4 percent  state sales
tax  as well as a 0.375 percent Metropolitan Commuter
Transportation District tax. In New York City, purchases under
$110 have already been exempt from the city’s own 4.5 percent
 sales tax  which makes a total of 8.875 percent or about $8.88 in
savings on a $100 item.  “You can’t split a suit in half,” to meet the exemption,
said Wayne Berkowitz, a partner and head of the State and Local
Tax Group with Berdon LLP in  New York . “If you’re buying five
items and they’re all under-$110 items, you’re good.”  The full  tax exemption  returns after a more than one-year
hiatus when it was amended to help close a state budget
shortfall. From October 2010 to March 2011 there was no relief
from the state sales tax or the commuter surcharge. Those breaks
returned for items of less than $55 in price from April 2011
through March.  Removing the exemption entirely for the six months starting
in 2010 generated about $330 million in revenue for the state,
according to Morris Peters, spokesman for the New York State
Budget Division. Reinstating it at the $55 level rather than at
$110 for one year brought in about $210 million for the state.
 New York City  exempts clothing and footwear purchases under $110
from local sales tax and will continue to do so as of April 1,
according to  documents  from the city’s Office of Management and
Budget.  “We’re pleased the exemption can again be offered,”
Peters said.  No Rental Wear  The tax break applies only to apparel items for people, and
generally includes yarn, fabric and other clothing components.
It excludes accessories such as watches and jewelry, equipment
such as motorcycle helmets and costumes or formal wear that’s
rented. Antique clothes meet the exemption if they’re purchased
for wear, rather than as collectibles.  Berkowitz said he isn’t planning to hit the stores on
Sunday to take advantage of the savings. “My daughter’s in
college. I can’t buy clothes for myself,” he said. “All my
partners can go out and buy suits now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
