New Zealand  company treasurers put
a low priority on the importance of commodity risk, with two-
thirds saying they don’t manage that exposure, according to a
survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Commodity risk was the lowest ranked of eight treasury
activities across the 95 companies surveyed, PWC said in an e-
mailed report today. Working capital management and liquidity
risk were the most important activities, the survey showed.  Agricultural commodities including milk and lumber make up
60 percent of New Zealand’s  exports , while the nation imports
most of its crude oil. Two-thirds of companies said they had
significant exposure to commodities, led by oil, electricity and
agricultural products, the survey showed.  “By enhancing their understanding and management of
commodity risk, organizations can achieve greater stability in
corporate earnings and improve the likelihood of meeting
forecasts,” PWC said. “We expect commodity risk to become
increasingly managed in New Zealand corporates the same way as
other market risks.”  About 34 percent of firms said they managed their commodity
risk, compared with 77 percent that protect themselves against
currency fluctuations and 90 percent that take out interest-rate
hedges, PWC said.  The survey showed 87 percent of respondents had an annual
budget of less than NZ$500,000 ($410,000) for treasury
operations, and two-thirds function with the equivalent of one
full-time staff member.  To contact the reporter on this story:
