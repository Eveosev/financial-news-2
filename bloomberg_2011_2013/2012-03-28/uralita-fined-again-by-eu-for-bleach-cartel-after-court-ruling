Uralita SA (URA)  was  fined  4.23 million
euros ($5.6 million) by European Union regulators for a chemical
cartel after a court overturned an earlier penalty.  The European Commission fined the company again today,
according to a statement, after the EU’s General Court last year
annulled a 9.9 million-euro penalty imposed in 2007.  Uralita will be reimbursed for the difference of the two
fines with interest, said a company spokeswoman who declined to
be identified.  The Madrid-based firm and former unit Aragonesas Industrias
y Energia were among companies fined 79 million euros by the
region for operating a cartel for sodium chlorate, an oxidizing
agent used to bleach pulp and paper.  Ercros SA (ECR) , a Madrid-based
chemical company, bought the chemicals businesses of Uralita,
 Spain ’s largest building-materials maker, in June 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
