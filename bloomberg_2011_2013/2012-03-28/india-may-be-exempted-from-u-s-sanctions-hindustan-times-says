India  may be exempted from U.S.
sanctions because of its plans to reduce Iranian oil imports by
as much as 20 percent, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported,
citing unidentified government officials.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  last week granted Japan
and European Union countries six-month, renewable exemptions
from new U.S. measures aimed at curbing Iran’s oil revenue that
take effect June 28, crediting them with “significantly
reducing” imports from the Persian Gulf nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
