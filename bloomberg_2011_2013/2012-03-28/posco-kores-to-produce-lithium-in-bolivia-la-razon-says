Posco (005490)  and  Korea Resources Corp. (KORESCRZ) 
will build  Bolivia ’s first lithium plant with state-owned mining
company  Comibol , daily  La Razon  reported.  The project will produce 30,000 metric tons of lithium,
used to make batteries, and 700,000 metric tons of potassium by
2014, the La Paz-based newspaper said, citing Comibol’s lithium
manager Luis Alberto Echazu.  Bolivia’s central bank will provide a $879 million loan for
the project, La Razon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
