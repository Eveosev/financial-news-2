Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti ’s popularity fell after his cabinet endorsed a bill that
eases firing rules, a poll showed.  Confidence in Monti declined four percentage points to 55
percent from the previous survey Feb. 27, Rome-based IPR
Marketing said today in a survey for daily la Repubblica.  His cabinet approved a bill March 23 to overhaul the labor
code, prompting a call for a general strike by CGIL, the biggest
union, and criticism by the  Democratic Party , one of the three
main groups supporting the government. Under the proposed rules,
companies will be able to fire workers during difficult economic
times without the risk of a court ordering their reinstatement.  The unelected premier, who took over on Nov. 16 from former
Premier  Silvio Berlusconi , is the most popular member of his
government, together with Interior Minister, Anna Maria
Cancellieri, today’s poll showed. They are followed by
International Cooperation Minister Andrea Riccardi and Industry
Minister  Corrado Passera , who both enjoy the confidence of 53
percent of Italians, IPR said.  Monti’s popularity compares with a rating of 22 percent for
Berlusconi in IPR’s poll in November, his lowest level since
2008. Today’s poll of 1,000 people was conducted March 26 and
has a margin of error of 3.3 percent, IPR said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
