MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) , the
mining company controlled by Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista ,
said fourth-quarter profit declined 4.8 percent after heavy rain
curbed  iron-ore  production.  Net income fell to 69.2 million reais ($38 million) from
72.7 million reais a year ago, the Rio de Janeiro-based company
said in a regulatory  filing  late yesterday. MMX was expected to
post a net loss of 30 million reais, according to an estimate by
analysts at Banco Itau BBA SA.  The company plans to spend at least 7.9 billion reais to
quintuple its output capacity to 53 million metric tons by 2016
as it taps rising demand from  China  and other emerging nations.
MMX is rivaling  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  and Ferrous Resources Ltd. in
boosting iron-ore output from projects in the Brazilian eastern
state of  Minas Gerais .  MMX’s iron-ore output declined 32 percent to 1.44 million
metric tons in the quarter while sales volumes dropped 6.3
percent to 1.95 million tons, the company said. Gross revenue
increased 31 percent to 291.5 million reais, it said.  The output reduction “was mainly due to the exceptionally
heavy rainfall” in December in the state of Minas Gerais, where
MMX’s Serra Azul mine is located, it said. “There has never
been as great a volume of rainfall recorded in the last 100
years” like the state’s volumes in December and January, MMX
said, citing the Brazilian government.  Third-Party Purchases  MMX is purchasing iron-ore from third-party vendors to make
up its sales volume after the decline in production, BMO Capital
Markets analyst  Tony Robson  said in a note to clients.  Production at MMX’s Corumba unit, in the center-west state
of Mato Grosso do Sul, also slumped 90 percent in the quarter
after reduced navigability of the Paraguay River used to export
the iron ore, the company said.  MMX added 0.1 percent to 9.17 reais in Sao Paulo at 11:02
a.m. Before today, the stock has  gained  37 percent this year,
more than twice the 16 percent increase in the Brazilian
benchmark Bovespa  index .  Iron-ore prices slumped to $116.90 per ton on Oct. 28,
their lowest level since December 2009, after reaching $191.90
in early 2011 on concern demand from China, the biggest user of
the steelmaking ingredient, is slowing.  The price of ore with 62 percent iron for  immediate
delivery  to the Chinese port of Tianjin gained 0.4 percent to
$147.70 a ton today, its highest level since October, according
to a  price index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  (MMX will host a conference  call  with investors today at 11
a.m. New York time.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
