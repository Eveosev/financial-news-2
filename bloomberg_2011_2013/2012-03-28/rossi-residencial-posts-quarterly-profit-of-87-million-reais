Homebuilder  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3) 
advanced, defying a rout in most Brazilian stocks, after the
company reported a fourth-quarter profit that was higher than
some analysts projected.  Shares gained 0.7 percent to 10.33 reais at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo . The benchmark Bovespa index slid 1.5
percent.  Rossi’s fourth-quarter net income was 87 million reais ($48
million), the Sao Paulo-based company said in a regulatory
filing yesterday. It was expected to post net income of 78.1
million reais excluding extraordinary items, the average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  “Results came in at reasonable levels, with margins
improvements and sequential decreases in cash burn,” analysts
at Credit Suisse including Guilherme Rocha wrote in a research
note today.  Net income before adjustments was 91.5 million reais,
according to the filing. The homebuilder’s net sales increased
29 percent to 916 million reais in the quarter, while new
projects totaled 1.9 billion reais.  To contact the reporters on this story:
