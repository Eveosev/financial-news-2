Soybeans advanced before a U.S.
government report this week that may show planting for the next
season will be little changed and as drought curbed the harvest
in  South America , dimming global supply prospects.  U.S. growers will seed 75.2 million acres with soybeans,
little changed from the prior year, Rabobank International said
in a report yesterday. Southern Hemisphere soybean output will
fall 12 percent to 121.5 million tons, Oil World said yesterday.
 China ’s imports of the oilseed will jump 6.3 percent in 2011-12,
the Hamburg-based researcher said.  “We expect that lower South American production, limited
U.S. acreage gain and increased imports by China will bring the
2012-13 U.S. soybean balance into a deficit and support soybean
prices over corn prices over the next 12 months,” Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said in a report today.  Soybeans for May delivery rose 0.5 percent to $13.77 a
bushel by 11:22 a.m.  London  time on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 14 percent this quarter.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is scheduled to release
the results of a national survey of farmers’  planting intentions 
and the government’s estimates of grain inventories on March 30.  “Concerns about the yields in South America and the report
that’s coming out on Friday about plantings are pushing prices
higher,” Chung Yang Ker, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte.,
said by phone from  Singapore .  Corn for May delivery gained 0.2 percent to $6.3225 a
bushel. The price is down 2.2 percent this year.  Wheat futures for May delivery rose 0.5 percent to $6.43 a
bushel in  Chicago . The price is down 1.5 percent this year.
Milling wheat for May delivery on NYSE Liffe was unchanged at
213.25 euros ($284.58) a metric ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
