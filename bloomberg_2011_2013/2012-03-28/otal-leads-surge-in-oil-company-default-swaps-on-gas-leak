Total SA (FP)  led a surge in the cost of
insuring debt of European suppliers after a gas leak from
France’s largest oil producer’s Elgin platform in the U.K. North
Sea entered its fourth day.  Credit-default swaps on Total soared 22.5 basis points to
102.5 basis points, according to CMA at 3 p.m. in London, the
highest since Nov. 29 and up from 60 basis points March 26.
Swaps on  ENI SpA (ENI)  jumped 17 to 144,  Transocean Ltd. (RIG)  rose three to
47,  BP Plc (BP/)  climbed four to 91 and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  rose
three to 60.  Total said it would take at least six months to drill an
emergency well to stop escaping gases after a blowout on March
25, and Shell shut the neighboring Shearwater field to guard
against explosion. BP’s  credit rating  was cut by  Standard &
Poor’s  in 2010 as it took five months to drill a relief well to
permanently plug the worst U.S. oil spill.  “While I don’t think there’s a risk they won’t pay, there
is obviously a risk of less flexibility in their financial
metrics and potential downgrade,” said  Elisabeth Afseth , an
analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London. “Some widening is
clearly warranted but it’s very tricky to say what is the right
amount and what is too much when nobody has any idea what is the
scale of the incident.”  Deepwater Rig  Swaps on BP soared to 577 basis points from about 40 as oil
leaked into the  Gulf of Mexico  for 87 days after an explosion on
the Deepwater Horizon rig in April 2010 killed 11 workers. The
contracts dropped to about 70 basis points by the end of that
year.  Total surpassed BP today for the first time in two years.
An increase signals deterioration in perceptions of credit
quality.  “I expect, as with BP, that you may have consequences of a
big incident like that but it’s not really going to affect their
debt substantially,” Afseth said. “The  oil companies  have very
strong cash flow, so they can take quite a lot.”  The cost of insuring corporate and financial debt in Europe
also rose, according to BNP Paribas SA. Contracts on the Markit
iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly high-yield
credit ratings rose 7.5 basis points to 587.5. The Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose
three basis points to 120 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers rose six basis points to 208 and the
subordinated index climbed 14 to 334.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.3 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
