Yuan forwards fell after the
central bank weakened the reference rate for the first time in a
week as U.S. consumer confidence data reduced the likelihood of
the  Federal Reserve  rolling out more monetary stimulus.  The People’s Bank of  China  lowered the yuan’s  daily fixing 
by 0.11 percent to 6.2912 per dollar, after setting it at record
highs for the last three days. The Dollar Index climbed by as
much as 0.2 percent yesterday as a gauge of U.S.  consumer
confidence  was 70.2 this month, near February’s 71.6, which was
the highest in a year. The yuan weakened 0.2 percent since the
end of last year, poised for its first quarterly drop since 2009.  “Market sentiment worsened today as there isn’t much hope
for more quantitative easing in the short term,” said Tommy Ong,
the Hong Kong-based senior vice president of treasury and
markets at DBS Bank ( Hong Kong ) Ltd. “Demand for the yuan has
been weaker this year because investors are expecting less
appreciation on concerns over China’s growth.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.15 percent
to 6.3415 per dollar as of 5 p.m. in Hong Kong, a 0.6 percent
discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The yuan gained 0.02 percent to close at 6.3060 per dollar
in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade
System. The currency is allowed to move as much as 0.5 percent
on either side of the fixing. In Hong Kong’s offshore market,
the yuan fell 0.03 percent to 6.3139.  One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at 2.4
percent.  Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said he wants to bolster
currency ties with China, his nation’s largest trading partner,
according to the text of a speech today in  Melbourne . The
 Reserve Bank  of  Australia  and People’s Bank of China signed a
A$30 billion ($31.3 billion) currency-swap agreement last week
to ensure the availability of capital between the trading
partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
