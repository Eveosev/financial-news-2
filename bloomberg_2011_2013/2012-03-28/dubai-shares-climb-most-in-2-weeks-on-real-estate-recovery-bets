Dubai’s benchmark stock index
climbed the most in more than two weeks amid investor optimism
the emirate’s real-estate and construction industry is
recovering.  Emaar Properties PJSC (EMAAR) , the developer of the world’s tallest
skyscraper in Dubai, surged 4 percent.  Arabtec Holding Co. (ARTC) , the
biggest publicly traded construction company in the  United Arab
Emirates , climbed to the highest since March 6. The  DFM General
Index (DFMGI)  advanced 1.9 percent, the most since March 11, to 1,683.18
at the 2 p.m. close in the emirate. The measure has jumped 24
percent this year. The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index rose less than
0.1 percent.  “There is more appetite for risk in general, which favors
the real estate and construction segment,” said Hans Zayed,
head of equity research at Rasmala Investment Bank Ltd. in
Dubai. “There are some signs of recovery in some areas in the
Dubai real estate market. There is some recovery in selling
prices, transaction volumes are up and the hospitality segment
is performing well.”  Mortgage lending for all Dubai properties jumped in the
first two months of 2012 by 59 percent to 5.95 billion dirhams
($1.62 billion) from a year earlier, according to data from the
emirate’s Land Department. While Emaar’s apartment sales plunged
85 percent last year, sales of villas surged by a similar pace.
Dubai property prices slumped more than 60 percent from their
peak in 2008 as speculative demand waned and banks tightened
lending.  Emaar gained the most since March 11 to 3.09 dirhams and
Arabtec advanced 3.8 percent to 3.02 dirhams.  Qatar’s  QE Index (DSM)  and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul All Share Index
added 0.2 percent. Bahrain’s measure fell 0.2 percent, Oman’s
MSM30 Index lost 1.3 percent and  Abu Dhabi ’s measure declined
0.3 percent. Kuwait’s gauge closed unchanged.  To contact the reporter on this story:
