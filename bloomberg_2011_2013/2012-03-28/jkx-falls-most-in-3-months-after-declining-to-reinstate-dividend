JKX Oil & Gas Plc (JKX) , an oil and gas
producer active in Ukraine and Russia, fell in London trading
after the board opted not to reinstate a dividend.  JKX shares dropped as much as 8.2 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Dec. 19, and traded down 6.9 percent at
171 pence as of 10:12 a.m. local time.  After a period of “very intensive”  capital spending , the
board won’t recommend renewing dividend payments that were
suspended last year, Chief Executive Officer Paul Davies said.  JKX was hit by higher taxes in Ukraine as well as a
production decline of 12 percent last year to 9,045 barrels a
day. The explorer’s Koshekhablskoye project in  Russia , which
will add output of about 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day,
has completed the first phase after a delay and is scheduled to
reach capacity this year.  “The board looks at paying dividends at the end of each
period, and it tends to be a reflection of operations,” Davies
said in telephone interview. He declined to say when he expects
a dividend to be paid again. “The key thing is that a big
project has completed and is coming on stream. We’ve got a
relatively benign commercial environment, and that bodes well
for 2012.”  JKX today reported a 14 percent decline in operating profit
to $82.1 million after absorbing an increase in Ukrainian
production tax of $61.7 million. Revenue rose 23 percent to a
record $236.9 million, the company said in a statement.  Capital expenditures declined to $162 million last year
from $178.5 million the previous year, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
