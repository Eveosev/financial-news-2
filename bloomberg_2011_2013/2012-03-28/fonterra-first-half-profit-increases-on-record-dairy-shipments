Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd. (FCG) ,
the world’s largest dairy exporter, reported first-half profit
rose 18 percent as surging demand from  Asia  boosted shipments to
a record.  Net income rose to NZ$346 million ($283 million) in the six
months ended, Jan. 31, from NZ$293 million a year earlier, the
Auckland-based company said in a statement today. Sales gained
7.2 percent to NZ$10.03 billion.  Fonterra, which accounts for about 40 percent of the global
trade in dairy products, in January said it exported a record
246,000 metric tons of dairy products in December, amid
increasing demand for protein in Asia.  China ’s purchases of milk
powder surged 45 percent in February, according to NZX Agrifax.  Prices “remained relatively stable throughout the first
half,” Chairman Henry van der Heyden said in the statement.
“These prices were supported by strong demand for quality dairy
ingredients in  emerging markets  across a number of Asian
economies, as well as Brazil and China.”  Last month, the company said milk delivered to its New
Zealand plants rose 9.8 percent in the eight months ended Jan.
31 from a year earlier amid favorable farming conditions.  The company maintained its March 12 forecast milk payment
to farmer shareholders of NZ$6.35 per kilogram of milk solids.
It also maintained its forecast of a full-year dividend of 40
cents to 50 cents, based on earnings of NZ$570 million to NZ$720
million in the year ending July 31.  To contact the reporters on this story:
