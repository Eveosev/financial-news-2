Petropavlovsk Plc (POG) , a miner of gold
in  Russia , was one of only two stocks to advance on the FTSE 350
Mining Index today after reporting a 10-fold increase in profit.  Petropavlovsk climbed 1 pence, or 0.2 percent, to 621 pence
at the close in  London  and was the second-best performer in the
25-company  mining index . The shares earlier rose as much as 8.1
percent after the company said 2011 net income jumped to $230.9
million from $19.8 million as gold prices and output increased.  “Today’s strong set of numbers should help the company see
a return of investor interest” after previous results were
“disappointing,” Nomura International Plc said in a note to
investors. Net income slumped 86 percent in 2010 after
production costs increased.  Gold producers’ profits have been buoyed by near-record
prices for bullion as  Europe ’s sovereign-debt woes and central
banks’ money-printing spurred demand for precious metals. Gold
for immediate delivery averaged $1,573 an ounce last year,
compared with $1,227 a year earlier.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization totaled $597.1 million in 2011, Petropavlovsk said
in today’s statement. That beat the $538.9 million average
estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The London-based company, whose gold output rose 24 percent
to 630,100 ounces last year, is targeting production of 680,000
ounces in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
