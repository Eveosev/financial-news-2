The  National Football League 
adopted overtime rules that increase the chance of both teams
playing offense by requiring the first team with the ball to
score a touchdown to win the game immediately.  Owners expanded the overtime rule for playoff games to
include the regular season, voting to approve the change at the
league meeting in  Palm Beach , Florida, the NFL  said on its
website .  Owners also voted to require replay review of turnovers,
eliminating the need for coaches to challenge on-field calls.
Scoring plays are already reviewed automatically.  To contact the reporter on this story:
