Palm oil  fell for the first time in
four days as some investors deemed a rally to the highest level
in more than a year as excessive.  The June-delivery contract declined 0.2 percent to close at
3,473 ringgit ($1,134) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange. Futures reached 3,497 ringgit in intraday trading
yesterday, the highest level since March 10, 2011. The commodity
has rallied 9.4 percent this quarter.  “Profit-taking at higher levels pulled down palm oil
prices,” Shikha Mittal, an analyst at Karvy Comtrade Ltd., said
by phone from the Indian city of Hyderabad. Concerns that palm
oil production may decline and damages to soybean crops in South
America helped limit losses, she said.  Palm oil production growth in the first half will slow from
the same period in 2011 while the drought in  South America  will
curb supplies of soybeans, boosting prices, Dorab Mistry,
director at Godrej International Ltd., said yesterday.
Production will increase by 2 million tons this year compared
with 5.5 million tons in 2011, said Mistry, who’s traded the
tropical oil for more than three decades.  Soybeans can be crushed to make soybean oil, which competes
with palm oil for use in food and fuel.  Soybeans for May delivery gained 0.4 percent to $13.7575 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for the same
month advanced 0.2 percent to 55.22 cents a pound.  Palm oil for delivery in September declined 0.3 percent to
close at 8,716 yuan ($1,384) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange .  Soybean oil  for delivery in the same month dropped 0.3
percent to 9,702 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
