Henkel AG (HEN3) , the German maker of
Persil detergent, signed a $800 million-euro ($1.1 billion)
revolving credit line, according to an e-mailed statement from
the company.  The five-year facility includes two one-year extension
options, the Dusseldorf-based company said. An existing $700
million-euro five-year facility signed in March 2010 will remain
in place.  Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG coordinated the loan,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
