Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  declined for a
seventh day, leading Czech shares toward a two-month low, after
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. recovery
isn’t assured and France’s economy grew less than expected.  The Austrian lender fell 1.9 percent to 440 koruna by 1:07
p.m. in Prague, paring its rally this year to 27 percent. The
14-member  PX (PX)  gauge, where Erste has a 19 percent weighting, slid
0.6 percent to 984.6, poised for its lowest close since Feb. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
