John Studzinski, senior managing
director of  Blackstone (BX)  Group LP and a cultural philanthropist,
awarded 25,000 pounds ($40,000) to a  London  music venue,
inaugurating an art prize he’ll give out every two years.  Winner Hamish Dunbar founded  Cafe Oto  in London’s East End,
by turning a disused warehouse into a venue for experimental
music and sound art. The prize is aimed at encouraging
institutions to mentor budding talents, and will be worth 50,000
pounds when it is next awarded in two years’ time, 56-year-old
Studzinski said in an interview.  Studzinski in May 2007 pledged 5 million pounds to Tate
Modern for its new extension. He is spending 3 million pounds
this year nurturing young art in the U.K. via donations to
institutions including the  Royal Court Theatre .  “It’s sort of a venture capital of mentoring,” Studzinski
said of his new art prize. “By funding other organizations or
other individuals that are mentors, you’re providing awareness,
getting organizations to focus on how important it is.”  He said the prize “consists of money to be invested in
mentoring and nurturing” and that winners could not be
“reinvesting it in themselves.”  The winner was picked by a panel of seven judges including
the architect  Richard Rogers , the Young Vic Theatre’s director
David Lan, and Studzinski himself.  To contact the writer on the story:
