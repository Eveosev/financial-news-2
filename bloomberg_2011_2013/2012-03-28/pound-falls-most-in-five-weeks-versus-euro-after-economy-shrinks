The pound fell the most in five
weeks against the euro after a government report showed the
economy shrank more than first estimated, strengthening the case
for more central-bank stimulus.  Sterling dropped for a second day versus the dollar, paring
its first quarterly gain since the three months ended June, as
the data also showed household disposable income declined.  Bank
of England  Governor Mervyn King said yesterday he has an open
mind on whether more asset purchases, or quantitative easing, is
needed to boost the economy. Gilts rose.  “The data was a touch disappointing and that put sterling
on the back burner,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-
fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “There’s a
refreshed dovish element to the pound since King yesterday.
Anything that comes from an official, which lays the door open
for possible further QE, takes the shine off the pound.”  The pound weakened 0.6 percent 83.95 pence per euro, the
biggest drop since Feb. 22, before trading 0.5 percent lower at
83.88 pence at 4:43 p.m.  London  time. Sterling depreciated 0.7
percent to $1.5847, trimming this quarter’s gain to 2.1 percent.  U.K.  gross domestic product  dropped 0.3 percent in the
fourth quarter from the previous three months, compared with a
previous estimate of 0.2 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in London. Real household disposable income fell
0.2 percent, the second successive quarterly decline.  U.K. Gilts  The pound fell 0.4 percent today, the biggest decline among
10 developed-nation currencies tracked in Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 0.1 percent and the dollar
rose 0.4 percent.  The yield on the 10-year gilt dropped five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 2.21 percent. The 4 percent bond due
March 2022 rose 0.505, or 5.05 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 115.9 percent of face value.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 2.1 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Demand for U.K. assets has waned in 2012 as European
leaders made progress in resolving the region’s sovereign-debt
crisis and  Greece  won partial forgiveness from its private-
sector creditors. Italy’s borrowing costs declined today as the
nation sold 8.5 billion euros ($11.3 billion) of bills at the
lowest yield in more than a year.  Sterling may extend its drop after yesterday failing to
stay above $1.60, which may have pushed it toward its high from
October and November, according to  Michael Hewson , an analyst at
CMC Markets U.K. Plc in London.  The U.K. currency may fall to $1.5820 should it break below
“key support” at $1.5920, Hewson wrote in a note to clients.
“Once below that, the $1.5610, 50 percent retracement of the
entire up move from $1.5240 to the $1.5990 highs, remains a key
support,” he said  Support refers to an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate orders to buy a currency to be grouped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
