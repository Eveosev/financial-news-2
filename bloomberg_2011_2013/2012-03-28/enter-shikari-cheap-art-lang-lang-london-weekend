Meet the Bliss family.  Noel Coward ’s “Hay Fever” plots the zany goings-on in a
Bohemian household. The mother Judith (played by Lindsay Duncan)
is a onetime actress, father David is a novelist, and the son
and daughter are spoiled stay-at-homers.  When four guests drop in, there are unexpected
interactions, and it all gets pretty messy. Set in a rickety
1920s artists’ studio, the play is frothy and very funny.  “Hay Fever” is, fittingly, at the  Noel Coward Theatre ,
85-87 St. Martin’s Lane, WC2N 4AU. Information:

that were removed by the pathologist who autopsied him at his
death in 1955. They are now on show at the  Wellcome Collection .
The pathologist actually kept the whole brain, ignoring
Einstein’s wish for his remains to be cremated and scattered.
The genius’s cerebrum was, it’s said, neither big nor heavy.  Elsewhere in the “Brains: The Mind as Matter” show is a
sinister section about three boys aged 1, 2 and 7 who were
victims of the Nazi euthanasia program targeting those deemed
mentally defective. Their brains, found much later in the
basement of a Vienna research institute, were buried in  Germany 
in 2003.  At the Wellcome Collection through June 17. Information:
 http://www.wellcomecollection.org .  The  Gilbert Scott , along the road from the Wellcome
Collection, is a restaurant and bar housed in the Victorian
Gothic splendor of St. Pancras train station. You can go for
cocktails or enjoy traditional British dishes with a twist in
the high-ceilinged dining room. Information:

get back to the 1990s thanks to Jarvis Cocker’s band Pulp.  “Disco 2000” and “Common People” will be among the hits
wheeled out for the faithful as the band reunites. The Who’s
Roger Daltrey organizes the charity shows, which also include
Jessie J on Sunday night.  Royal Albert Hall,  Kensington Gore , SW7 2AP. Information:

Camden for five weeks.  Sunday features a performance by the London-based company
“Collectif and then…,” about human estrangement and inspired
by Jonathan Safran Foer’s “Extremely Loud and Incredibly
Close.”  At 6 p.m. at the Roundhouse, Chalk Farm Road, London NW1
8EH. Information:  http://www.roundhouse.org  or +44-844-482-8008.  Primrose Hill, a pleasant stroll from the Roundhouse, is
home to Odette’s, a charming restaurant that opened in 1978.
It’s now owned by chef Bryn Williams, whose resume includes
three years with Michel Roux Jr. at Le Gavroche. There’s a
walled garden at the back. The weekend lunch menu is 22 pounds
($35) for two courses. Information:
