OAO Acron (AKRN) , a Russian fertilizer
maker, plans to sell 15 billion rubles ($515 million) of 10-year
bonds to replace debt it’s buying back as part of a
reorganization.  Acron shareholders last month approved a takeover of its
Granit unit, which led to the cancelation of about 15 percent of
Acron’s treasury shares. That triggered a  put option , giving
holders of about 10 billion rubles of Acron’s bonds the right to
sell them back to the company.  The board of directors approved the sale of three, 5
billion-ruble tranches of bonds as a “substitute,” Ilya Popov,
head of  investor relations , said by e-mail today. He declined to
comment on the volume of bonds tendered so far.  Acron will use cash and “committed credit facilities,
mainly in U.S. dollars” to buy out bondholders and the new
ruble debt will serve as a “natural hedge corresponding to
Acron’s revenue structure” which is mostly dollars, rubles and
yuan, Popov said.  The bonds may be sold as soon as next quarter, while the
exact timing will depend on market conditions, he said. “We do
not expect material changes in  interest rates ” on the new
bonds, Popov said.  The yield on Acron’s 10-year bonds putable in 2014 was
unchanged at 8.19 percent as of 6 p.m. in Moscow today, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
