The  Ohio (STOOH1)  Senate approved $1.74
billion for capital projects, a measure that will authorize
$1.36 billion in bonds backed by the General Revenue Fund.  The  House of Representatives  approved the bill March 22.
The measure, which will pay for school and infrastructure
construction, will go to Governor  John Kasich  for his signature
after the House approves a Senate amendment, Angela Meleca, a
spokeswoman for Senate Republicans, said in a telephone
interview.  Kasich proposed the measure for spending in fiscal 2013-14
as part of a “Mid-Biennium Review” halfway through  Ohio (STOOH1) ’s two-
year budget, with policy proposals in areas including taxes,
energy and education. It is the smallest  capital budget  in Ohio
in at least a decade, Dave Pagnard, a spokesman for the Office
of Budget and Management, said in a telephone interview.  The governor said he asked the state’s 37 public university
and college presidents to agree on a plan for $400 million in
capital projects.  The bill passed today also includes $675 million for
primary and secondary school construction and $300 million for
local infrastructure projects, according to administration
documents.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
