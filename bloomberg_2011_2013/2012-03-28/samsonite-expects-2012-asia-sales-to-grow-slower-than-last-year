Samsonite International SA (1910) ’s sales
in  Asia , its largest market, will increase 15-20 percent this
year, slowing from 43 percent growth in 2011, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Tim Parker said.  Sales in  Europe  and the U.S. at the world’s largest
branded-luggage maker will see “upper single-digit” growth in
2012 as the European economies show signs of recovery, Parker
said in an interview in Hong Kong today.  Economic growth in China and  India , Samsonite’s two largest
markets in Asia, slowed last year and this may continue in 2012.
Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  set a 2012 economic growth target of
7.5 percent on March 5, lower than an 8 percent goal in place
since 2005. India’s government predicts growth may rise 6.9
percent in the fiscal year to March, compared with 8.4 percent
in the previous one. Still, Parker said Asia demand will become
a bigger part of the company’s business in the coming years.  “There is a huge demand for our products” in Asia because
of the increasing number of travelers, Parker said. “ China  is
growing really fast,” he said. “People are getting disposal
income. They want to travel.”  Samsonite  shares  have gained 15 percent in Hong Kong this
year compared with a 13 percent advance in the benchmark  Hang
Seng Index . The stock dropped as much as 2.8 percent today
before trading 0.9 percent lower at HK$14 as of the midday break.
This compares with its IPO price of HK$14.50 a share in June
when Samsonite raised about HK$9.73 billion ($1.25 billion).  Profit Beats Estimates  The maker of backpacks, luggage and travel gear today
reported 2011  net income  of $86.75 million, beating the mean
estimate of $76.6 million from three analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News and ahead of the $64.2 million forecast in the
company’s June prospectus.  Asia accounted for 37 percent of group sales of $1.57
billion last year, Samsonite said in a statement to  Hong Kong ’s
stock exchange.  Spain and  Italy  have “flat” sales and are the biggest
challenges in Europe for the Massachusetts-based company, Parker
said last month. Most economies in Europe have begun to show
evidence of recovery in recent months, he said today.  “What’s encouraging from our perspective is that people in
the States are traveling more,” he said, while “if you look at
some of the European economies people are under a lot of
pressure, but they don’t want to give up their holidays.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
