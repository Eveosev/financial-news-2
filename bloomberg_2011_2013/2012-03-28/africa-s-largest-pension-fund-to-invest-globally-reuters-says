South Africa ’s Government
Employees’ Pension Fund may invest about $22 billion of the $150
billion it manages outside of the country, Reuters reported,
citing actuarial head John Oliphant.  The fund plans to invest 9 percent of its assets in global
markets, particularly emerging markets, with 5 percent in Africa
outside of South Africa, the news agency cited Oliphant as
saying. It is also considering direct commodity investments as
infrastructure growth makes industrial metals including  iron ore 
and copper more attractive, he said.  Stephen Gunnion in Johannesburg at +27-11-286-1936 or
