Pfleiderer AG (PFD4)  plunged as much as 47
percent in Frankfurt trading after the German maker of wood-
based panels for furniture and interior fittings said it’s
preparing to file for insolvency.  The shares slid 15 cents, or 42 percent, to 20 cents as of
9:45 a.m. after falling as low as 19 cents. An 88 percent
decline over the past 12 months has reduced the Neumarkt-based
company’s market value to 11.8 million euros ($15.8 million).  Pfleiderer said late yesterday that it lost a bid for
bondholders to participate in a restructuring plan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
