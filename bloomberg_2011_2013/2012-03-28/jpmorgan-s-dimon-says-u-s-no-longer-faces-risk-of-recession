JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  Chief
Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  said the U.S. may no longer be at
risk of another recession and the housing market is nearing the
bottom.  Dimon, head of the largest and most profitable U.S. bank,
said today in an interview on CNBC that the  Federal Reserve (FDTR)  will
maintain policies designed to boost growth until policy makers
are convinced hiring is on the rise across the country.  “My own read is that they want to see 300,000 to 400,000
jobs a month for six months before they declare victory,” Dimon
said. “If that actually happened, they might reverse course
sooner than people think.”  Dimon, 56, reiterated his upbeat forecast for the economy,
saying that the U.S. housing market is close to “the inflection
point.”  Although  home prices  are still falling, “all the other
signs are flashing green,” Dimon said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
