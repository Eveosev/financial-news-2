Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)  Chief
Executive Officer  Richard Handler ’s pay for fiscal 2011 fell
7.9 percent after the investment bank’s shares slid 48 percent
last year and he declined a $4.88 million bonus.  Handler, 50, was awarded $14 million for the fiscal year
ended Nov. 30, compared with $15.2 million for the 11 months
through November 2010, New York-based Jefferies said today in a
filing. The package included $1 million in salary and $13
million in restricted-stock units that were granted in 2010.
Handler elected to not receive a bonus for 2011. The firm
shifted the end of its fiscal year to Nov. 30 in 2010.  The CEO worked to reassure investors, amid a 14 percent
November stock slide, about the company’s holdings in European
sovereign debt after the Oct. 31 bankruptcy of MF Global
Holdings Ltd. Handler cut the firm’s  total assets  by 23 percent
to $35 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter.  Jefferies climbed 39 percent this year to $19.11 yesterday.
It hit a 2 1/2-year low of $9.50 during trading on Nov. 17.  Handler told investors in December that he,  Brian Friedman ,
chairman of the firm’s executive committee, and other senior
leaders gave back their bonuses for 2011, saying at the time
shareholders had a “tough year.” Jefferies will “protect our
scarce dollars” by clawing back 2011 bonuses from any employee
who leaves for a competitor this year, Handler said in December.  Friedman’s Award  Friedman was granted a $10.5 million package for fiscal
2011, the filing shows, including a $750,000 salary and $9.75
million in restricted stock units that were granted in 2010.
Chief Financial Officer Peregrine Broadbent received $1.88
million.  The firm gave employees a choice for the stock-based
portion of their annual bonuses. Workers could choose between
accepting the firm’s shares and taking cash at a 25 percent
discount, a move that boosted Jefferies’s cash-compensation
expense by $17.5 million, according to its annual report.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  cut CEO  James Gorman ’s 2011 pay 25 percent
to $10.5 million as yearly profit dropped 13 percent and shares
fell 44 percent, a person familiar with the plans said in
January.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  gave Chairman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein a $7 million restricted-stock bonus for 2011, a
decrease from $12.6 million a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
