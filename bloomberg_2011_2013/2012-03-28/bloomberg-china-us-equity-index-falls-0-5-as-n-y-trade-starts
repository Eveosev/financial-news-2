Chinese equities  traded in the U.S.
sank to the lowest level in three weeks on concern a slowdown in
the world’s second-largest economy is eroding profits.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. slid 2 percent to 103.34 yesterday in
New York, the weakest close since March 7.  Cnooc Ltd. (CEO) , China’s
biggest offshore crude explorer, dropped to a two-month low as
oil plunged and analysts predicted the company’s 2012 net income
will decline. China Life Insurance Co., which reported a 46
percent slide in 2011 profit, dropped the most in a week.  China’s  Shanghai  Composite Index tumbled the most in four
months as  Jiangxi Copper (600362)  Co., the nation’s largest producer of
the metal, posted an 18 percent drop in net income and Societe
Generale SA said Chinese corporate profits won’t grow at all
this year. The government cut China’s economic growth target to
the lowest since 2004 on March 5 and indicators from housing to
industrial output have been slowing as the European debt crisis
and sluggish U.S. recovery damp global export demand.  “We are concerned about China’s macro economy and you’ve
seen some of the slowdown in growth rates in some of the
companies,” said Tim Cunningham, who helps oversee $83 billion
of assets, including Chinese stocks, at Thornburg Investment
Management Inc. in  Santa Fe ,  New Mexico . “We’re a little
cautious on China overall and we’ve cut back our weight.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., sank 1.5 percent to $36.70,
the lowest close since Jan. 9. The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) 
retreated 0.5 percent to 1,405.54.  Spreadtrum Leads Drop  American depositary receipts of  Spreadtrum Communications
Inc. (SPRD) , a Shanghai-based mobile-phone chip designer, were the
biggest decliners on the Bloomberg China-US gauge, plunging 6.7
percent to $15.65, the biggest slump in a month.  The company forecast on Feb. 29 that sales will come in at
$158 million to $163 million in the first quarter of this year,
below last quarter’s $192 million, and compared with a $171
million average of seven analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  Focus Media Holding Ltd. (FMCN) , a digital advertising company
based in Shanghai, lost 5.8 percent to $26.05, the largest one-
day drop since March 6.  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU) , which runs  China ’s fifth-
most visited website, fell 3.9 percent to $55.95, also the
steepest decline since March 6.  “Advertising spending to increase market share at some
smaller Chinese Internet companies won’t be sustainable this
year,” said Eric M. Jackson, president and founder of Ironfire
Capital, a Naples, Florida-based hedge fund that invests in
Chinese stocks. “Chinese Internet companies will have difficult
year-over-year comparisons this year.”  Underweight China  Chinese stocks will extend their slump as the slowing
economy hurts company earnings, according to Bank Julius Baer &
Co., which has about $286 billion in client assets worldwide.
China’s  gross domestic product  expanded at the slowest pace for
ten quarters in the last three months of 2011.  On the Shanghai Composite, 462 companies have posted profit
growth of 17 percent on average, trailing analyst estimates by
4.1 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compared with
an increase of 38 percent in the previous year.  Aberdeen Asset Management Plc said on March 27 that it is
underweight on China, meaning it holds less of the nation’s
securities compared with benchmark indexes. John-Paul Smith,
Deutsche Bank AG’s London-based emerging-market strategist, said
yesterday the “recent corporate data appears to support our
bearish case.”  Industrial Profits  Industrial companies posted their first January-February
profit decline since 2009, as net income dropped 5.2 percent
from a year earlier to 606 billion yuan ($96 billion), the
National Bureau of Statistics said on March 27. That compared
with a 34.3 percent gain in the first two months of 2011.  Sina Corp. (SINA) , owner of the Twitter-like Weibo site in China,
predicted last month that it will post a loss this quarter amid
a slowdown in usage growth and plans to spend more on its
microblogging service. Shanghai-based  Sina (SINA)  dropped 2.8 percent
to $66.71 in New York, falling for the seventh time in eight
days.  E-Commerce China Dangdang Inc. (DANG) , China’s biggest Internet
bookseller known as Dangdang, slipped 3.5 percent to $7.88, the
biggest drop in a week.  Beijing-based Dangdang’s net loss in the last three months
of 2011 was 129.8 million yuan ($20.6 million), compared with
net income of 14.8 million yuan a year earlier, the company said
in a statement on Feb. 23.  Cnooc Discount  The data on industrial company profits suggests 2012
consensus earnings estimates for Hong Kong-listed Chinese
companies are “far too optimistic,” Societe Generale
strategists Guy Stear and Anthony Lee wrote in a client note
dated March 27.  ADRs of Beijing-based Cnooc slid 3 percent to $206.45, the
lowest level since Jan. 31, and traded 2.6 percent  below  the
company’s  Hong Kong  stock, the biggest discount since Dec. 14.
Cnooc fell 1.9 percent to HK$16.46 yesterday, the equivalent of
$2.12 per share. Each ADR represents 100 common shares in the
company.  Crude prices in  New York  declined 1.8 percent after the
U.S. Energy Department said supplies rose by 7.1 million barrels
to 353.4 million, the largest increase since July 2010 and more
than twice the gain predicted in a Bloomberg survey of analysts.  China Life Profit  Cnooc’s  2012 net income  will decline 4.9 percent from 2011
to 66.8 billion yuan ($10.6 billion), according to the average
of 19 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The oil
producer plans to boost output by as much as 2.7 percent this
year to 330 million to 340 million barrels of oil, it said
yesterday.  2011 net income climbed 29 percent to a record 70.3 billion
yuan as crude prices surged, Cnooc said yesterday in a
statement. Profit for the second half of the year rose 8.8
percent from a year ago, according to calculations made by
subtracting first-half earnings from the full-year net income.  ADRs of China Life, the nation’s largest insurer, dropped
1.8 percent, the most in a week, to $39.05.  Net income for 2011 declined to 18.3 billion yuan, or 0.65
yuan a share, from 33.6 billion yuan, or 1.19 yuan, a year
earlier, the Beijing-based insurer said in a statement to the
Hong Kong stock exchange on March 26.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  tumbled 2.7 percent to
2,384.88 yesterday, the biggest drop since Nov. 30. The  Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in Hong
Kong fell 1 percent to 10,701.37. The gauge has declined every
trading day since March 13 except March 27, taking its loss this
month to 9.5 percent.  Jiangxi Copper tumbled 5.5 percent to 24.69 yuan in
Shanghai yesterday, the equivalent of $3.92. It was the biggest
one-day decline since Dec. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
