Deutsche Post AG (DPW)  said it will ask
investors for permission to list the company’s shares on an
exchange outside Germany as  Europe ’s largest postal service
seeks to expand its shareholder base.  The authorization also applies to the listing of depositary
receipts or certificates representing shares, the Bonn-based
company said in an invitation for its May 9 annual shareholder
meeting published today.  “A large number of investors are only prepared to invest
if the shares are admitted to trading on the stock exchange in
their country,” Deutsche Post said in the invitation. “There
are no specific plans to list the company’s shares on any
foreign stock exchange.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
