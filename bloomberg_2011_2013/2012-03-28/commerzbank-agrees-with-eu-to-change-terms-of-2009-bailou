Commerzbank AG (CBK) , a German lender
rescued following the 2008 financial crisis, reached an
agreement with the European Union on restructuring measures
related to its bailout, the EU antitrust chief said.  “We have an agreement,”  Joaquin Almunia , the EU
competition commissioner, told reporters. The details of the
restructuring measures will be announced on March 30, he said.  Commerzbank sought EU approval to change the terms of its
bailout, which required it to sell Eurohypo by the end of 2014.
Germany’s second-biggest lender has said a sale of the public-
finance and commercial-property lender would be difficult
because of concerns over the division’s ability to fund itself.  EU regulators have required banks to sell assets to
compensate for the harm to competition caused by large amounts
of aid pumped into the industry following the collapse of  Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ)   Commerzbank spokesman Simon Steiner couldn’t immediately be
reached to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
