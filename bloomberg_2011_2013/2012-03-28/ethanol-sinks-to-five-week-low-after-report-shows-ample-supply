Ethanol fell to a five-week low in
 Chicago  after a government report showed stockpiles near a
record and as corn and gasoline declined.  Futures dropped after the Energy Department said  supply 
fell 0.4 percent to 22.6 million barrels from a record 22.7
million the previous week. Corn, the primary ingredient in the
fuel in the U.S., was down on speculation that farmers will
boost acreage and gasoline slipped after oil inventories climbed
the most in 20 months.  “You’re barely moving the needle in inventory declines,”
said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in Chicago. “It was
very tame actually. The decline today had more to do with
energies and corn being down.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery slumped 4.1 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $2.207 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest price since Feb. 22. Prices have fallen 11 percent in
the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast fell 5
cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.375 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive decreased 3.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.32,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago slid 2 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.23 a
gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the fuel lost 0.5 cent to $2.295.  Corn for May delivery fell 10.5 cents, or 1.7 percent, to
$6.2025 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for April delivery fell 1.01 cents, or 0.3
percent, to settle at $3.3955 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
