Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande  would defeat French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in a run-
off, even as the gap between the two men narrowed, a poll said.  The survey, conducted by OpinionWay-Fiducial for Le Figaro
newspaper and cable news channel LCI, shows Hollande would win a
head-to-head race in the May 6 second round by 54 percent to 46
percent. Thatâ€™s the same gap found in three separate polls
released yesterday. The previous OpinionWay survey two weeks ago
showed Hollande winning by 55 to 45 percent.  Sarkozy leads Hollande for the April 22 first round by 28
percent to 27 percent, with Sarkozy gaining 0.5 point and
Hollande losing 0.5 point. Anti-immigrant campaigner Marine Le Pen was third at 17 percent. Under the French system, the top
two go into a run-off.  The survey was carried out March 26-27 among a sample of
1,148 people interviewed via Internet. The margin of error is 2-
3 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
