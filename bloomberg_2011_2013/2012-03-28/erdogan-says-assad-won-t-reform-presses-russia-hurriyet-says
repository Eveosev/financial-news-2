Turkish Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan  said he doesn’t believe Syrian President Bashar al-Assad
will implement a United Nations plan to end his yearlong
crackdown on the opposition, Hurriyet  reported .  During a meeting in  Seoul , the Turkish premier pressed
Russian President Dimitry Medvedev to take steps to end the
violence in Syria, where the UN estimates more than 9,000 people
have been killed in the past year, according to the Istanbul-
based newspaper. It cited comments Erdogan made during a flight
from Seoul to Tehran.  Syria accepted a six-point UN plan yesterday that was
proposed by special envoy Kofi Annan. Erdogan said Assad is
playing for time by agreeing to the UN plan before the Friends
of  Syria  group of about 70 countries meet in Istanbul on April 1
to discuss steps to end the crisis, Hurriyet reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
