Allergan Inc. (AGN)  is seeking to expand
the medical use for its wrinkle smoother Botox, saying that
injections of the drug into the bladder helped decrease symptoms
of severe urinary incontinence in two studies.  Botox led to a “statistically significant” decline in
incontinence among patients with overactive bladder, the Irvine,
California-based company said in a statement today. Based on the
results, Allergan said it has applied for approvals from the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European Union officials.  Botox, Allergan’s best-selling product, had $1.59 billion
in  sales  last year, about half for cosmetic uses and half for
migraine treatment, incontinence and other conditions. Analysts
estimate the new indication, for more-severe bladder problems,
may generate about $400 million a year, Allergan Chief Executive
Officer David Pyott said in a phone interview.  “I think we’re going to surprise a lot of people in the
investment community,” Pyott said. “They assumed we’d be
filing for this toward the end of the year.”  The company was able to enroll patients in the trials and
collect data faster than expected, the CEO said. A regulatory
decision from the FDA should come by early next year, he said.
The studies treated patients with overactive bladders not caused
by a neurological condition and who had failed to respond to
standard medication, according to the company’s statement.  Allergan  fell  less than 1 percent to $94.05 at the close of
trading in  New York . The shares had gained 35 percent in the
past 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
