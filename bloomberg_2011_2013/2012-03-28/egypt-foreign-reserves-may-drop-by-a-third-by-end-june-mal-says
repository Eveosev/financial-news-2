Egypt’s foreign-currency reserves
may drop to $10.4 billion at the end of June, compared with
$15.7 billion in February,  Al Mal  reported, citing the assistant
defense minister for financial affairs.  Mahmoud Nasr said he forecast economic growth to be about 2
percent during the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and
the next, the newspaper said. He defended the armed forces’
economic projects and said the military has supported the North
African country’s economy with about 12.2 billion Egyptian
pounds ($2 billion) since last year’s protests began.  Egypt’s international reserves have plunged by more than
half since the uprising against  Hosni Mubarak  and the economy is
struggling to recover from a drop in investment and tourism.  To contact the reporters on this story:
