Italy’s two-year bonds fell for a
second day before the nation sells as much as 8.5 billion euros
($11.3 billion) of 182-day bills.  Germany ’s 10-year bond yields approached a two-week low
before a report economists said will show inflation in  Europe ’s
biggest economy slowed this month. French bonds rose even after
a report showed gross domestic product grew less than previously
estimated. Finance ministers are preparing to meet later this
week to discuss the euro region’s bailout provisions.  “There’s still a lot of insecurity” over how Italy can
reach its budget goals, said Christian Reicherter, a Frankfurt-
based analyst at DZ Bank AG, Germany’s fourth-largest bank. “It
could be slightly more expensive for the Italian Treasury to
sell these bills.”  The Italian two-year yield climbed two basis points to 2.64
percent at 9:08 a.m. London time. The 3 percent note due April
2014 fell 0.035, or 35 euro cents per 1,000-euro face amount, to
199.73 percent of face value.  Yields on German 10-year bonds were little changed at 1.90
percent. The yield fell to 1.855 percent on March 23, the least
since March 13. French 10-year yields dropped three basis points
to 2.93 percent.  European ministers are set to meet on March 30 in
Copenhagen to discuss the prospect of combining the temporary
European Financial Stability Facility bailout fund and its
permanent successor, the European Stability Mechanism.  Break-Even Rate  The German 10-year break-even rate, a gauge of inflation
expectations, rose to its highest since January. The rate,
derived from the difference in yield on conventional and
inflation-linked German securities, was at 1.82 percentage
point, the most since Jan. 24.  A preliminary reading from the Federal Statistics Office
will show German consumer price inflation, calculated using a
harmonized European Union method, slowed to 2.3 percent from a
rate of 2.5 percent in February, according to the median of 24
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  German bunds have lost 0.2 percent this quarter, their
worst quarterly performance since the three-months ending March
31, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
