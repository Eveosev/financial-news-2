Asia ’s naphtha crack spread
extended gains, signaling increased profit for refiners making
the petrochemical feedstock. Hin Leong Trading Pte sold gasoil
cargoes in Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
$2.92 to $124.35 a metric ton at 5:15 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread
gained for a third day to the widest in a week.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 25,000 tons of open-
specification  naphtha  for first-half June delivery from Mabanaft
GmbH at $1,059 a ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders
who monitored transactions on the Platts window.  Gracewood International Ltd. sold 50,000 barrels of  92-RON
gasoline (MOGFC92S)  to Total SA at $135 a barrel, the survey showed. The
cargo is for loading from April 17 to April 21.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong sold 210,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with
0.5 percent sulfur to a unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co. for April
12 to April 16 loading, according to the Bloomberg survey. The
cargo changed hands at 10 cents a barrel below April 11 to April
17 prices.  Hin Leong also sold 250,000 barrels with 0.25 percent
sulfur to China International United Petroleum & Chemical Co.,
or Unipec, the survey showed. The shipment traded at a $1-a-
barrel premium to quotes for April 16 to April 20.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude gained 6 cents
to $14.99 a barrel at 2:26 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The difference, also known as the
 crack spread , widened for a second day.  Jet fuel ’s premium to gasoil was up 10 cents at 25 cents a
barrel, PVM said. This  regrade  climbed for the first time in
four days, indicating it is more profitable to make  aviation
fuel .  China Aviation Oil Singapore Corp. purchased 100,000
barrels of  jet fuel  from Shell at 20 cents a barrel below
benchmark quotes, the Bloomberg survey showed. The cargo will
load April 12 to April 16.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil dropped 14 cents to $6.96 a barrel below Dubai
crude at 2:26 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM. That’s the
biggest  discount  in a week, signaling losses for refiners
turning oil into residual products.  The premium of  180-centistoke (N6SHS180)   fuel oil  to  380-centistoke (N6SHS380) 
grade was down 50 cents at $11.50 a ton, PVM said. This
 viscosity spread  narrowed for the first day in four, meaning
bunker, or marine fuel, advanced more than higher-quality fuel
oil.  Refinery News  Formosa Petrochemical Corp. in  Taiwan  plans to start a
residual desulfurization unit in early April that was damaged in
a July 2010 fire. The company is waiting for the Yunlin county
government’s approval to resume operations at the refinery unit,
said Chairman Chen Bao-lang.  Japan ’s Toa Oil Co. will shut the Mizue crude distillation
unit and boiler at its Keihin plant on April 2 for repairs, Rim
Intelligence reported on its website.  Tenders  PetroChina Co. bought two 35,000-ton cargoes of naphtha
from Bharat Petroleum Corp. for April to May loading, according
to two traders who declined to be identified because they aren’t
authorized to speak with the media. The transactions were at
premiums of $41 a ton and $44 a ton to Middle East prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
