(Corrects reference to Dutch auction in second paragraph.)  German 10-year bond yields
approached a two-week low before a report economists said will
show inflation in  Europe â€™s biggest economy slowed this month.  The 10-year break-even rate, a gauge of inflation
expectations, was two basis points from the highest since
January. Italy plans to auction 8.5 billion euros ($11.3
billion) of 182-day bills. French bonds were little changed as a
report showed gross domestic product grew less than previously
estimated.  The German 10-year yield was at 1.87 percent at 7:27 a.m.
London time. The yield fell to 1.855 percent on March 23, the
least since March 13. The 2 percent bond due January 2022 traded
at 101.1 percent of face value. French 10-year bonds yielded
2.96 percent.  The 10-year break-even rate, derived from the difference in
yield on conventional and inflation-linked German securities,
was at 1.80 percentage point, after reaching 1.82 two days ago,
the highest since Jan. 24.  A preliminary reading from the Federal Statistics Office
will show German consumer price inflation, calculated using a
harmonized European Union method, slowed to 2.3 percent from a
rate of 2.5 percent in February, according to the median of 24
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  German bunds have lost 0.2 percent this quarter, according
to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. French bonds have gained 2 percent
and Spanish securities have risen 1.2 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
