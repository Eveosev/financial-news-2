The four No. 1 regional seeds will
contest the semifinals of college basketball’s national women’s
tournament for the first time in 23 years after the University
of  Connecticut  and Notre Dame University won last night.  Connecticut defeated second-seeded Kentucky 80-65 to reach
its fifth straight national semifinal, and Notre Dame eliminated
No. 2 seed Maryland 80-49 in the regional finals.  The Huskies and Fighting Irish meet in the national
semifinals April 1 in Denver, while undefeated Baylor plays
Stanford for a place in the April 3 title game. The Bears beat
Tennessee 77-58 and the Cardinal topped Duke 81-69 two nights
ago.  “You have to beat the best teams in the end of the year
because they don’t get beat by the lesser teams,” Connecticut
coach Geno Auriemma told reporters.  The four top seeds last reached the semifinals of the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in 1989.
Stanford,  Notre Dame  and Connecticut were in the Final Four last
year, while Baylor played in the semifinals two years ago.  If Baylor wins the championship, it will become the first
men’s or women’s team to finish a season with 40 wins in the
history of the NCAA tournament.  At the Thomas F. Ryan Center in Kingston,  Rhode Island ,
Tiffany Hayes scored 22 points and Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis added
18 for the Huskies (33-4). Samarie Walker had 14 points for the
Wildcats (28-7).  At PNC Arena in Raleigh,  North Carolina , Skylar Diggins
scored 22 points and Natalie Novosel had 18 points for the
Fighting Irish (34-3). Alyssa Thomas led the Terrapins (31-5)
with 17 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
