Kazakhstan will look at bidding for
state stakes in Belarusian refineries, said Yergali Bulegenov,
the Central Asian country’s ambassador to  Belarus .  “Kazakhstan would be interested in taking part in the
privatization of any stake in Belarusian oil refineries to be
able to sell petroleum products to  Europe  at higher prices,”
Bulegenov told reporters in the Belarusian capital, Minsk today.  Belarus plans to sell $12.5 billion in assets in the next
five years, according to the government and central bank’s joint
strategy published on Jan. 20. Sales this year, including
companies linked to the oil industry, may bring in at least $2.5
billion, State Property Committee Chairman Georgy Kuznetsov said
Feb. 17.  Belarus is considering sales of a controlling stake in
Naftan, one of its two refineries, Interfax  reported , citing
First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Semashko on March 19. The
potential investor should pay a fair market price and double or
triple the amount of taxes it pays into the Belarusian budget in
the first 5 to 10 years after the acquisition, while maintaining
Naftan’s jobs, wages, and social services at their current
level, the Russian news service said, citing Semashko.  Naftan can process 170,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to the refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
