Qatar’s economy grew an annual 14.7
percent in the fourth quarter as natural gas output rose and  oil
prices  increased.  Real gross domestic product rose to 95.5 billion riyals
($26.2 billion) compared with 83.3 billion riyals a year
earlier,  the statistics authority  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The economy expanded 14 percent for the year.  Qatar, the world’s biggest producer of liquefied natural
gas, increased its capacity to make the fuel to an annual 77
million tons last year with the start of its 14th liquefaction
plant. It also opened the world’s largest plant that converts
gas into liquid fuels such as diesel and jet fuel. Oil prices
averaged $111 a barrel in  London  last year, up from $80 a year
earlier.  Economic growth may ease to 5 percent this year as
expansion of the emirate’s energy industry slows, the economic
planning board said in October. Qatar doesn’t plan any more gas
liquefaction plants amid a moratorium on new development of the
North Field, the world’s biggest gas reservoir.  The gross domestic product grew 35.9 percent in nominal
terms to 171.8 billion riyals and increased 36 percent to 631.6
billion riyals for the year, the statistics authority said. Oil
and gas accounted for 58.3 percent of the country’s nominal GDP
in 2011, the authority said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
