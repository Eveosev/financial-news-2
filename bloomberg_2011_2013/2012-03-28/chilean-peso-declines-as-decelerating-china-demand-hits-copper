Chile’s peso weakened the most
among major South American currencies as the price of copper,
the country’s biggest export, fell on concern that demand from
 China  will fade as growth slows.  The peso sank 0.6 percent to 489.29 per  U.S. dollar  from
486.23 yesterday. Copper for May delivery fell as much as 2.5
percent in  New York . The Bloomberg JPMorgan Latin American
Currency Index  fell  0.5 percent.  Chinese copper demand based on trade data climbed 26
percent in January and February from a year earlier, down from
30 percent growth in December, according to Standard Chartered
Plc. China bought a record $4.3 billion of Chilean copper last
quarter, more than the U.S. and  Japan  combined.  “Emerging-market currencies have depreciated in general,
but the peso in particular is being hit by copper,” said
Gonzalo Castro, a currency trader at Scotiabank Sud Americano in
Santiago. “There has been talk in the last couple of days about
the Chinese economy weakening and that has direct repercussions
on copper.”  Offshore investors in the forwards market had a net short
position in pesos of $5.4 billion on March 26, down from $5.7
billion on March 23, according to data published by the central
bank. Local investors cut their long position to $17 billion
from a nine-month high of $17.2 billion on March 23.  The median forecast of 58 traders and investors in a
central bank survey published today was that the peso would
reach 485 in seven days and 490 in three months’ time.  Break-Even Rates  Two-year break-even inflation fell six basis points, or
0.06 percentage point, to 3.38 percent as the price of oil
declined the most in a week. Chile relies on imports for almost
all its oil and gas consumption and a 10 percent increase in oil
equates to a 0.48 percent increase in Chilean consumer prices,
according to research published yesterday by Standard Chartered
Plc.  The Chilean government today sold inflation-linked bonds
due in five, seven and 30 years.  Investors placed orders for 166 percent of the five-year
bonds, which were sold at a yield of 2.47 percent; 224 percent
of the seven years, which were sold at 2.67 percent; and 188
percent of the 30 years, which were sold at 2.98 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
