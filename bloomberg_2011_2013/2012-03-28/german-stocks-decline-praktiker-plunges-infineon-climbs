German stocks declined as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  warned that the U.S.
unemployment rate remained too high, offsetting a rally by
Infineon Technologies AG and Fresenius Medical Care AG.  Praktiker AG plunged 11 percent to 1.86 euros after posting
a larger loss in 2011 than analysts had estimated.  The benchmark DAX Index lost 0.4 percent to 7,048.83 as of
11:21 a.m. in  Frankfurt , erasing an earlier advance.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
