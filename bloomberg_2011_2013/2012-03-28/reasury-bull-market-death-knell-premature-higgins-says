Treasury yields may pare their
recent gains after the U.S. government bond market’s worst
quarter in more than a year amid continued Federal Reserve
market intervention and a slow economic recovery, according to
Standish Mellon Asset Management Co.’s Tom Higgins.  Talk of the 30-year-old bull market’s end is “premature”
because benchmark 10-year note yields may head lower before they
settle into a higher trading range of 2.25 percent to 3 percent
by the end of 2012, Higgins, global macro strategist in  Boston 
at the firm, said in a phone interview. At 3 percent, yields
would still be lower than the decade average of 3.86 percent.  Yields rose last week to 2.40 percent, the  highest level 
since October, after the Fed raised its assessment of the
economy at its March 13 meeting, prompting traders to unwind
bets on more monetary stimulus by the central bank in the form
of debt buying. The central bank reiterated its commitment to
holding the target lending rate at zero to 0.25 percent at least
until late 2014 to support the recovery.  “The continued weak backdrop in the economy, the
deleveraging environment we are still in, regulation that favors
less risky assets and the continued presence of the Fed will
continue to anchor rates at lower levels,” said Higgins, whose
firm oversees $85 billion in fixed-income assets.  Yields on 10-year notes dropped two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 2.17 percent at 11:57 a.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent
securities maturing in February 2022 advanced 5/32, or $1.56 per
$1,000 face amount, to 98 17/32.  Quarterly Losses  Treasuries have lost 1.2 percent so far this year in what
would be their biggest quarterly decline since the end of 2010,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The drop
comes after  U.S. government debt  returned 9.79 percent last
year, the most since 2008.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , who cited “green shoots” of
recovery in the U.S. in March 2009 only to see the U.S. jobless
rate reach 10 percent seven months later, said yesterday in text
of an interview with ABC’s  Diane Sawyer  that “it’s far too
early to declare victory” regarding the economy.  After buying $2.3 trillion of assets to support the economy
in two rounds of quantitative easing from December 2008 to June
2011, the  central bank  has been replacing shorter maturities in
its holdings with longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs
without increasing its balance sheet. The $400 billion program,
known as Operation Twist, is due to end in June.  Lenders will have to continue adding Treasuries to meet new
reserve rules under the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law and
 Basel  III regulations set by the  Bank for International
Settlements  in Basel,  Switzerland .  “It’s very premature to claim that the  bear market  in
bonds has arrived,” Higgins said. “We’ve seen run-ups in
yields flame out before, and we will continue to see that unless
there is major headway on the economic front.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
