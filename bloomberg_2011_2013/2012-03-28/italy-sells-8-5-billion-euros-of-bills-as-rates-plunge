Italy  auctioned 8.5 billion euros
($11.34 billion) of Treasury bills at the lowest rate in more
than a year as efforts to contain the region’s debt crisis
fueled confidence among investors.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros of 182-day
bills at 1.119 percent, the lowest since Sept. 2010, and down
from 1.202 percent at the last auction of similar-maturity
securities on Feb. 27. Investors bid for 1.51 times the amount
offered, compared with 1.36 times last month.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  is implementing a 20 billion-
euro package of spending cuts and tax increases to eliminate the
 budget deficit  and tame the nation’s 1.9 trillion-euro debt. His
efforts to consolidate public finances and spur economic growth,
coupled with the  European Central Bank ’s flood of three-year
loans to banks, has pushed the yield on the country’s 10-year
bond down more than 2 percentage points since his appointment in
November.  The yield on Italy’s 10-year bond was down 3 basis points to
5.087 percent at 11.17 a.m. in Rome, pushing the difference with
similar-maturity German debt to 321 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
