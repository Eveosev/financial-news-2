BancorpSouth Inc. (BXS)  reached a $1.75
million settlement with customers claiming they were unfairly
charged overdraft fees after the bank re-ordered their
transactions to maximize the fees, according to a court filing.  U.S. District Judge Robert T. Dawson in El Dorado,
Arkansas, gave preliminary approval to the settlement on March
26. BancorpSouth asked a judge in  Florida , where dozens of
similar cases against banks have been consolidated, to stop
proceedings against it while the settlement is completed.  “Under the settlement agreement BancorpSouth has agreed to
pay $1.75 million and provide additional benefits, reflecting
significant changes to BancorpSouth’s collection of overdraft
fees,” the customers’ lawyers said in a court filing.  More than 350,000 current and former customers of the
Tupelo, Mississippi-based bank are members of the  settlement
class , according to the court filing.  Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are among
the banks that previously reached settlements with their
customers.  The case is Thomas and Lawson v. BancorpSouth, 12-cv-01016,
U.S. District Court, Western District of  Arkansas  (El Dorado).  To contact the reporter on this story:
