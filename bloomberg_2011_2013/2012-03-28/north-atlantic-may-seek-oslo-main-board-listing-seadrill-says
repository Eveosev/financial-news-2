North Atlantic Drilling Ltd. (NADL) , which
raised $300 million from investors, may still seek to list on
the Oslo Bourse’s main board once it starts trading in New York,
 Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL)  Chief Financial Officer Esa Ikaeheimonen said.  “There’s a dual-listing possibility,” he said in an
interview in Oslo today. “Our current listing plan is to
convert the OTC listing straight into New York.”  Rig operator Seadrill, whose largest owner is billionaire
 John Fredriksen , today cut its stake in North Atlantic Drilling
to 74 percent from 77 percent as part of North Atlantic’s share
sale. The reduction means North Atlantic now meets minimum free-
float rules in New York, Ikaeheimonen said.  North Atlantic Drilling on Nov. 2 postponed plans to list
shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange, citing tax calculations in
 Norway  and the company’s relationship with Seadrill.  North Atlantic plans to complete its  New York  listing and
start trading shares on the exchange during the third quarter,
Ikaeheimonen said today. “The documentation is in pretty good
order,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
