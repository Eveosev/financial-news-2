Vinci Partners Investimentos Ltda.,
the Brazilian investment firm founded by former Banco Pactual SA
executives, is seeking to raise as much as 2 billion reais ($1.1
billion) for a private-equity fund.  Vinci Capital Partners II F Fundo de Investimento em
Participacoes plans to buy stakes in companies and take part in
their management, according to a March 23 regulatory filing by
the Rio de Janeiro-based company. The fund will have a 10-year
term and may be extended for two years.  Vinci Partners, led by Gilberto Sayao, was created in 2009
with about 5 billion reais from its partners, according to the
statement. Vinci has invested in Brazilian energy companies
 Equatorial Energia SA (EQTL3)  and  Light SA (LIGT3) , as well as car-rental firm
Unidas SA and Argentine soybean producer Grupo Los Grobo LLC.
Last year, the company became the master franchisee for Burger
King Holdings Inc. in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
