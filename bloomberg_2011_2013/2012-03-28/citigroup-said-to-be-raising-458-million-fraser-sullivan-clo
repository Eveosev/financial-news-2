Citigroup Inc. (C)  is raising a $458.3
million collateralized loan obligation for WCAS Fraser Sullivan
Investment Management LLC, according to two people with
knowledge of the deal.  The fund, which will refinance the COA Tempus CLO, includes
a $287 million slice rated AAA by  Standard & Poor’s , said the
people, who declined to be identified because the terms are
private. The CLO may price the week of April 9, the people said.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  Citigroup raised a $408.7 million CLO for Fraser Sullivan
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Fraser Sullivan, which managed about $5.4 billion in assets
as of Dec. 31, was founded in 2005 by John Fraser and Tighe
Sullivan. Private-equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe
has a 50 percent stake in the company.  John Fraser didn’t return a telephone call seeking comment.
