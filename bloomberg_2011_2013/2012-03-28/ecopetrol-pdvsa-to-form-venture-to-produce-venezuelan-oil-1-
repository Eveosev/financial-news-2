Colombia  will develop a plan with
Venezuela to tap reserves at aging oil fields as the neighboring
countries strengthen energy ties.  The venture would drill for oil in two blocks located in
western Venezuela’s Lake Maracaibo, Colombian Mines and Energy
Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said on Twitter. He met today with
Venezuelan Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  in Cartagena, Colombia.  Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has sought to
improve ties with President  Hugo Chavez  since taking office in
2010 by reviving trade, renewing energy accords and considering
ventures with state-run oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA,
known as PDVSA. Relations between the countries deteriorated
during the prior administration of President Alvaro Uribe, who
said Venezuela harbored Colombian rebels. Chavez has denied the
claims.  The board of  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s largest oil company,
has to review the plan for the venture to begin in October,
newspaper La Republica reported. Cardenas said the venture would
seek to increase output at the fields to 100,000 barrels a day
from 40,000 barrels a day, the newspaper reported.  Officials also met today to consider development of an oil
pipeline linking Colombia’s Pacific coast with Venezuela, and a
separate project to carry Venezuelan gas through Colombia to
Central America, Cardenas said prior to the meeting.  Ecopetrol has increased production by investing in new
fields, while output growth at PDVSA has stagnated.  Ecopetrol slid 0.4 percent to 5,380 pesos at 3:00 p.m. in
Bogota.  To contact the reporter on this story:
