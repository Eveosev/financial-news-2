FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ’s Rand Merchant Bank
will discontinue proprietary trading while combining its fixed
income, currency, commodity and equity trading units to boost
returns.  RMB found its “current portfolio would deliver returns
below the group’s hurdle rate unless certain actions were
taken,” Alan Pullinger, head of Johannesburg-based RMB, said in
an e-mailed statement today. “Outright proprietary trading
activities, in both FICC and equities are no longer able to
produce sustainable returns given the new capital regime.”  FirstRand, South  Africa ’s second-largest lender, said last
month that RMB’s pretax profit for the six months through
December dropped 15 percent to 1.78 billion rand. With banking
regulators worldwide working toward the implementation of new
capital levels under Basel III, RMB has been investigating the
effects these rules may have on its business.  “The changes in RMB are strategically based, are
significantly driven by Basel III and are not a disguised cost
cutting or retrenchment exercise,” Pullinger said. “Clearly if
certain activities are closed or significantly restructured,
certain individuals may well be impacted.”  South Africa ’s  Financial Mail  magazine reported on changes
at RMB earlier today.  RMB, with its parent company FirstRand, will continue to
expand in Africa and may soon receive a license to operate in
 Nigeria , Pullinger said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
