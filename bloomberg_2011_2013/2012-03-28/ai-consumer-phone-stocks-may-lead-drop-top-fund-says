Thailand   stocks  may fall as much as
10 percent in the second quarter, led by this year’s top
performing consumer and telecommunication stocks, as valuations
soared to the highest levels since at least 2007, according to
the nation’s top-ranked fund manager.  The benchmark SET  Index (SETENERG)  may rebound to 1,300 in the second
half of the year following a “correction” as economic growth
boosts companies’ earnings, Prapas Tonpibulsak, the chief
investment officer at Krungsri Asset Management Ltd., said by
phone today from Bangkok. The SET closed at 1,207.29 yesterday.
 Morningstar Inc. , a fund researcher, this month  ranked  two of
Prapas’s equity funds as the nation’s top stock funds in 2011.  Shares of Thai retailers and mobile-phone companies led an
18 percent climb by the SET this year to yesterday on optimism
spending by the government after the nation’s worst floods in
almost 70 years will spur economic growth and consumption. A
 measure  of consumer-related shares trades at 27.7 times
estimated profit, the highest level since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 2006. A  gauge  of phone stocks is valued
at 19 times, the most expensive level since December 2007.  “Retailers and telecommunication companies will face
higher selling pressure as they are rising too much and too
fast,” said Prapas, who oversees about $3.7 billion of assets
at Krungsri. “That would lead the overall market’s
consolidation in the second quarter before another rally.”  Largest Gains  The SET  index (SETCOM)  lost 0.3 percent to 1,204.2 as of 11:50 a.m.
in Bangkok. The gauge is poised for the biggest quarterly gain
since the three months to September 2010. Overseas investors
 bought  a net 79 billion baht ($2.57 million) of Thai stocks this
year, compared with net sales of 5.1 billion baht in 2011.  The SET Commerce Index, which comprises 13 retailers and
consumer-goods producers, has climbed 32 percent this year, the
largest  gain  among the bourse’s 27 industry groups, after
advancing 40 percent in 2011. The SET Information &
Communication Technology Index, which  tracks  27 mobile-phone and
telecommunication companies, has climbed 29 percent in 2012,
extending a 43 percent increase last year.  The  Krungsri Dividend Stock Fund (AYFSDIV) , one of Prapas’s two top-
ranked funds, gained 28 percent in the past year, beating 90
percent of its peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
 Krungsri Dynamic Fund (AJFSTDY)  has climbed 21 percent in the past 12
months, beating 83 percent of funds in its peer group.  Government Investment  Prapas advised investors to buy shares of energy companies
and banks. Higher crude prices and a rebound in petrochemical
prices will boost profit at oil producers and refiners, he said.
Investments in flood-protection projects by the government and
the rebuilding of damaged factories will bolster loan demand, he
said.  The SET Energy & Utilities Index, which tracks 24 oil and
utility companies, has risen 10 percent in 2012 after a 7
percent drop last year. A  gauge  of commercial banks has rallied
22 percent this year, on course for the best quarterly
performance since the three months to September 2010.  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has pledged 350 billion
baht for flood prevention and the  Bank of Thailand  cut  interest
rates  for a second straight policy meeting in January to revive
the economic growth. The  finance ministry  said on March 26
 Southeast Asia ’s second-biggest economy may expand as much as 6
percent in 2012, higher than an earlier prediction for growth of
about 5 percent.  “Higher energy and petrochemical prices should help energy
companies’ shares in 2012 after a very poor performance in
2011,” said Prapas. “Banks will maintain their high lending
growth with the increase in state investments and  consumer
spending .”  To contact the reporter on this story:
