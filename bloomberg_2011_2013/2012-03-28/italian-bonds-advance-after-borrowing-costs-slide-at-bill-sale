Italian 10-year bonds rose, paring
the extra yield investors demand to hold them instead of German
bunds, as the government sold bills at the lowest rate in more
than a year amid optimism the region’s debt crisis is easing.  Italian notes climbed after the Rome-based Treasury sold
8.5 billion euros ($11 billion) of 182-day bills at 1.119
percent, the lowest since September 2010, and down from 1.202
percent at the last auction of similar securities on Feb. 27.
The euro area’s woes are “almost over” Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said in  Tokyo  today. Portuguese two-year debt advanced for
the 10th straight day, the longest run of gains in three years.  “We had the Monti speech overnight with a positive
slant,” said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European interest-rate
strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in  London . The bill sale was
“OK and we have another auction tomorrow which is expected to
go OK as well so that might contribute” to spreads narrowing
further, he said.  The Italian 10-year yield slid four basis points, or 0.04
percentage points, to 5.08 percent at 11:24 a.m. London time.
The 5 percent note due March 2022 rose 0.310, or 3.10 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 99.875 percent of face value.  The yield spread over similar-maturity bunds,  Europe ’s
benchmark government securities, narrowed three basis points to
3.20 percent. Italy’s two-year note yield fell two basis points
to 2.60 percent. Yields on German bunds were little changed at
1.88 percent.  German bunds have lost 0.2 percent in the first quarter,
their worst quarterly performance in a year, according to
indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of
Financial Analysts Societies. Portuguese bonds handed investors
the biggest return of the 26 markets tracked by the indexes,
followed by Italian government debt, gaining 13 percent and 11
percent respectively, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
