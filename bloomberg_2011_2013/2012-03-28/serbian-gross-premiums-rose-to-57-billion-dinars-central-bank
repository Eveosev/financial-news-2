Serbian gross written insurance
premiums rose to 57 billion dinars ($681.5 million) last year,
central bank Vice Governor Mira Eric-Jovic said.  “Insurance companies in  Serbia  had a positive result in
2011,” Eric-Jovic said today at an insurers’ forum in Belgrade,
without disclosing details. “While this marked a nominal
increase, the premiums declined in real terms,”  The industry had 56.5 billion dinars in gross premiums at
the end of 2010, according to central bank  figures . The National
Bank of Serbia is supervising the entire financial industry
including banks, insurance companies and pension funds. The
central bank is due to issue final quarterly reports for all
three industries by early April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
