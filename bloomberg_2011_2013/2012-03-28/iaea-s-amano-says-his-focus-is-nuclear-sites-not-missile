Yukiya Amano, director general of
the  International Atomic Energy Agency  in Vienna, spoke to
reporters in Seoul today after meeting government officials. He
was also in the South Korean capital for the Nuclear Security
Summit, which ended yesterday.  Amano on  North Korea ’s plan for a rocket-launch that it says
will be used to put a satellite into orbit, and on the nation’s
nuclear facility at Yongbyon:
“We are following the issue of the satellite launch carefully.
We cannot be indifferent but our focus is of course the
monitoring and verification of the suspension of the activities
in Yongbyon.”  On sending inspectors to North Korea:
“My position and the IAEA’s position is that we have started
initial consultation with North Korea, and with other countries
which are members of the six-party talks.”
“Precisely speaking, nothing has been decided. The discussion
has just started so nothing concrete has been decided.”  On how difficult nuclear monitoring is in North Korea:  “Things won’t go easy. It takes time. Last time, it took
about several months for inspectors to arrive after the decision
was made. I am not sure how long it will take this time.
Generally speaking, monitoring is very special work. So planning
this work takes time. I have to hear details about the agreement
between the U.S. and North Korea. We also need to discuss what
exactly we can do.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
