The San Francisco 49ers agreed to a
contract with running back  Brandon Jacobs , who was released
earlier this month by the Super Bowl-champion New York Giants,
 ESPN reported  citing an unidentified person in the league.  Jacobs, 29, was a fourth-round draft pick of the Giants in
2005 and rushed for 4,849 yards and 56 touchdowns over seven
National Football League seasons. Last year, he had 571 rushing
yards -- his fewest since 2006 -- and scored eight touchdowns.  The Giants cut Jacobs after failing to reach an agreement
on a pay cut to his $4.9 million salary, which included a
$500,000 roster bonus, according to the Star-Ledger of Newark,
 New Jersey . ESPN didn’t disclose terms of his agreement with the
49ers and team spokesman Bob Lange didn’t immediately return an
e-mail seeking comment.  Jacobs would team in the 49ers’ backfield with starting
running back  Frank Gore , whose 1,211 rushing yards last season
ranked sixth in the NFL. Jacobs is the second former Giant to
join the 49ers this month, following free-agent wide receiver
 Mario Manningham .  The 49ers went 13-3 last season and lost the National
Football Conference title game to the Giants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
