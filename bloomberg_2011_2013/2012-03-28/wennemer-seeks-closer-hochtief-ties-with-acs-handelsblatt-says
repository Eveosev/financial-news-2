Hochtief AG (HOT)  should improve ties to
shareholder Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA to reap
synergies in “important” markets, Handelsblatt cited Hochtief
Supervisory Board Chairman Manfred Wennemer as saying.  Marcelino Fernandez Verdes, an ACS executive who was named
chief operating officer of Hochtief today, should work for that
goal, the newspaper reported, citing Wennemer in an e-mailed
summary of an article to be published tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
