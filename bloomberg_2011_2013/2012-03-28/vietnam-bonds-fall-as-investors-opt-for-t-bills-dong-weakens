Vietnam’s five-year bonds fell for
a second day after the central bank sold treasury bills at
higher interest rates. The dong weakened.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam resumed bill auctions March 15
after Governor Nguyen Van Binh said March 6 the bank would issue
short-term securities at different terms to withdraw idle cash
from the banking system. The central bank sold 2.8 trillion dong
($134 million) of 28-, 91- and 182-day bills today at yields of
11.5 percent to 12.5 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “For banks that have to have portfolios for T-bills or for
bonds, if the T-bill  interest rate  is higher of course they
choose T-bills,” said Ngo Minh Hoa, an institutional client
manager at BaoViet Securities Co. in Hanoi. Concern that fuel-
price increases will spur  inflation  also contributed to the
decline in bonds, she said.  The  yield  on benchmark five-year notes rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.49 percent, according to
a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg. Ten-year bonds
yielded 11.46 percent.  Vietnam  raised prices of petroleum products, including
gasoline, by as much as 12 percent on March 7. Consumer prices
rose 14.2 percent this month, the smallest gain in a year.  The dong fell 0.9 percent to 20,840 per dollar as of 3:55
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency has gained 1 percent this quarter. The State Bank of
Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec.
26, according to its website. The currency is allowed to
fluctuate by as much as 1 percent on either side of that rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
