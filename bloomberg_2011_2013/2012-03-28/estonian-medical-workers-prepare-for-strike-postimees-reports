Estonia’s doctors and nurses have
started to prepare for a strike after employers rejected their
wage demands,  Postimees  reported, citing union officials.  Doctors’ unions in the capital, Tallinn, and the second-
largest city, Tartu, have given their agreement to participate
in industrial action, the newspaper said. The timing and extent
of the strike has yet to be decided, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
