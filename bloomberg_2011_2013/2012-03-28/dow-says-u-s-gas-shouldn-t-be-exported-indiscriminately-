Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) , the largest U.S.
chemical maker, said domestic supplies of natural gas shouldn’t
be exported “indiscriminately” because the industry is
counting on continued low prices to justify factory investments.  Gas exports and U.S. government incentives to encourage its
use in vehicles may undermine chemical makers’ confidence that
prices will remain low, Jim Fitterling, executive vice president
for energy and feedstocks at Midland, Michigan-based Dow, said
today in a speech at the IHS World Petrochemical Conference in
Houston.  Dow plans to spend $4 billion to boost production on the
 Gulf Coast , joining chemical makers vying to build the first new
U.S. ethylene plants, which use gas to make the plastics
ingredient, in more than a decade. Added production from shale
gas deposits has caused prices to decline to the lowest in a
decade on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  “We are all nervous that we could get into a five-year
project and the gas is all being exported and prices spike up,”
Fitterling said in an interview. “Securing what is right for
America and then exporting the balance makes sense.”  Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG)  and Dominion Resources Inc. are among
companies that have proposed building export plants that would
liquefy gas for shipment overseas via tankers.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration is currently
studying the “proper” number of LNG export terminals that
should be permitted, Fitterling said. Export limits would
provide time for new chemical plants and converted  power plants 
to boost gas demand, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
