Warmer, drier weather expected
during the next five months will aid early U.S. crop planting
this year and threaten some yields in already parched fields
from  Texas  to North Dakota, according to Earthsat Weather.  The decaying La Nina weather pattern that damaged crops in
 South America  with dry weather during the past three months will
lead to a fast U.S. planting season, increasing the yield
potential for crops east of a line from eastern Texas to western
 Minnesota , Kyle Tapley, a meteorologist at Earthsat, a
Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MDA Information Systems Inc. unit,
said today at the companyâ€™s conference in  Chicago .  A weather pattern that is warmer and drier than normal from
June to August may trim corn and soybeans yields in the western
Midwest, with normal weather seen in the heart of the Midwest,
he said. There is a 25 percent risk that the period will be
cooler than the official forecast, Tapley said.  Adverse weather in parts of the Midwest will have a limited
impact on production because the fast start to U.S. sowing will
boost areas planted and accelerate crop development for the
hottest summer weather, Tapley said.  U.S. corn yields may rise to 161 bushels an acre,
increasing production 15 percent to 13.923 billion bushels,
compared with 12.358 billion a year earlier with a yield of
147.2 bushels an acre, Tapley said. Soybean output may rise 9.7
percent to 3.245 billion bushels from 3.056 billion in 2011, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
