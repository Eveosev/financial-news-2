Nigeria ’s naira fell the most in
almost a week after crude exporting companies reduced dollar
sales and deployed their foreign-exchange reserves to pay for
gasoline imports, leaving banks short of the U.S. currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer depreciated
0.1 percent to 157.8 per dollar as of 5:15 p.m. in Lagos, the
biggest drop since March 22, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Given that crude exporters who are also importers of oil
into Nigeria have to pay for oil imports, they see “no need to
sell or convert their foreign currency” reserves, Wale Abe,
chief executive of the Financial Markets Dealers Association,
said today.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  banned in October oil companies
that export crude from buying dollars at its bi-weekly foreign-
currency auctions, leaving them dependent on their own dollar
earnings, the  interbank market  and other sources to pay for
imports. It sold $128.75 million at a foreign-currency auction
on March 26, the lowest since Feb. 22, according to the Abuja-
based bank. Nigeria approved a tender to import 3.57 million
metric tons of gasoline for the second quarter on March 12.  The oil industry is the second major supplier of foreign
exchange to the West African country after the central bank,
which held the second of its twice-weekly auctions today.
Financial Markets Dealers Association, said today by phone.  Nigeria sold $150 million at a foreign-currency auction
today, with the marginal rate gaining by less than 0.1 percent
to 156.01 per dollar, the central bank said in an e-mailed
statement. This compares with the $128.75 million sold on March
26, the lowest since Feb. 22.  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged at 1.7765 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
