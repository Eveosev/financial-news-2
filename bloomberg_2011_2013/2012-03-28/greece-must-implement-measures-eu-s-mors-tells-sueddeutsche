Greece  still needs to implement
several measures which may be “painful” for its population to
restore the country’s fiscal health and remain in the euro,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing the European Commission’s
Matthias Mors.  European Union member states will probably insist on Greece
not becoming accustomed to being a recipient of aid, the
newspaper cited the member of the so-called troika of the
commission,  International Monetary Fund  and  European Central
Bank  as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
