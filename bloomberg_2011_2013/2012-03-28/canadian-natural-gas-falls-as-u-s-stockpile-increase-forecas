Canadian natural gas fell amid
speculation that warmer-than-normal weather in the U.S. led to a
second-straight weekly increase in inventories.  Alberta  gas declined 1 percent. U.S. stocks of the fuel
probably rose 48 billion cubic feet last week, the median of 24
analyst estimates compiled by  Bloomberg (DOENUSCH) . The five-year average
inventory change for the week is a decrease of 8 billion cubic
feet, according to the  Energy Department (DOENUST5) .  “They just keep building up stocks,” said Gordy Elliott,
a risk management specialist at INTL FC Stone Inc. in St. Louis
Park,  Minnesota . “It’s pretty bearish.”  Alberta gas for April delivery fell 1.75 cents to $1.675 a
gigajoule ($1.59 per million British thermal units) as of 2:50
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market. NGX gas
is down 41 percent this year.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas touched C$1.625 a gigajoule March 8, the lowest for the
April near-month contract since it started trading in 2000.  Natural gas for April delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  fell 1.7 cents to settle at $2.191 per million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near  Chicago 
declined 1.04 cents to $2.0576 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas dropped 2.5 cents to $1.8476 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, gas fell 5.05 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $1.9361.  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.9 billion cubic
feet, 99 million above target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.92 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.23 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 971 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.68 billion cubic feet today, or 63 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.01
billion cubic feet at 1:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
