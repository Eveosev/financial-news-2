U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down for a second day, as a slump in
crude oil drove energy producers lower and government data
showed that orders for durable goods rose less than forecast.  Exxon Mobil Corp. and  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  paced
losses in 42 out of  43 energy companies  in the S&P 500 as oil
slumped following an increase in supplies. The Morgan Stanley
Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to the economy lost 1.6
percent as Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
recovery isn’t assured.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  slid
more than 2.2 percent. Financial shares had the only gain among
10 S&P 500 groups as  Bank of America Corp.  rallied 1.6 percent.  The S&P 500 slid 0.5 percent to 1,405.54 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time. While the benchmark gauge has lost 0.8 percent in two
days, it rebounded from its intraday low of 1,397.20 in the
final  two hours  of trading. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average 
declined 71.52 points, or 0.5 percent, to 13,126.21 today.  “Investor jitters have been heightened by another economic
report coming in a bit light and by the Fed chairman suggesting
the economy may be vulnerable to another period of turbulence,”
said  James Paulsen , who helps oversee about $333 billion as
chief investment strategist at Minneapolis-based Wells Capital
Management. “The selloff is also being fueled by a collapse in
energy stocks. After such a significant advance in the market,
investors are already worried about a correction.”  Today’s loss pared this month’s rally in the  S&P 500  to 2.9
percent. The index is still poised for the best  first quarter 
since 1998, up 12 percent. Financial and technology shares have
risen the most among 10 groups, surging more than 21 percent so
far in 2012.  Economic Data  Stocks fell today after a Commerce Department report showed
that bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
advanced 2.2 percent, less than projected after a revised 3.6
percent decline the prior month. Bernanke said unemployment
remains too high, the economic recovery isn’t guaranteed and
policy makers don’t rule out any further options to boost
growth.  “It’s far too early to declare victory,” Bernanke said,
according to a transcript of last night’s interview with ABC
News anchor Diane Sawyer provided by the network. “The recent
news has been good. But I think we need to be cautious and make
sure this is sustainable. And we haven’t quite yet got to the
point where we can be completely confident that we’re on a track
to full recovery.”  Energy and raw-material producers had the  biggest losses  in
the S&P 500 among 10 groups, falling at least 1.2 percent. Crude
oil for May delivery tumbled 1.8 percent to $105.41 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Exxon (XOM)  slipped 0.9 percent to
$85.86. Occidental Petroleum dropped 3.6 percent to $94.85.  Coal Shares  Coal producers slipped. U.S. electricity generators are on
track to burn 22 percent less coal this year than in 2011, said
Lucas Pipes, an analyst at Brean Murray Carret & Co. in New
York, citing data published in Coal & Energy Price Report, an
industry newsletter.  Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)  fell 4.2
percent to $14.87.  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)  declined 3.4 percent to
$28.83.  Concern about the economy weighed on companies whose
earnings are most-dependent on growth. Alcoa retreated 2.3
percent to $9.83. Caterpillar lost 3.5 percent to $104.26.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  dropped 1.5 percent to $43.51.  Rupert
Murdoch ’s News Corp. is taking steps to start a national U.S.
sports network on  cable television  aimed at challenging Disney’s
ESPN, according to people with knowledge of the situation.  Defective Packs  A123 Systems Inc. (AONE)  plunged 13 percent to $1.22, the lowest
price since it went public in 2009. The battery maker may be
unable to raise capital and could lose contracts as a result of
its recall of defective packs sent to customers, a Deutsche Bank
AG analyst said.  Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA)  fell 10 percent to $2.92 in its
biggest drop since August. The biotechnology company was cut to
neutral from overweight at Piper Jaffray Cos., which cited the
share price. The stock had gained 85 percent from March 16
through yesterday.  The KBW Bank Index rallied 1.1 percent as 22 of its 24
stocks gained. Bank of America increased 1.6 percent to $9.75
after the lender slumped 3.3 percent yesterday..  Medco Health Solutions Inc. (MHS)  added 3.2 percent to $71.20
after saying it expects its $29.1 billion takeover by  Express
Scripts Inc. (ESRX)  to close as soon as next week.  Express Scripts  will
probably get a Federal Trade Commission ruling on the deal as
early as March 30, said two people familiar with the case who
declined to be identified because the review is private. Express
Scripts increased 1.3 percent to $53.89.  Takeover Offer  Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMLN)  surged 54 percent, the most in
the  Russell 1000 Index (RIY) , to $23.77. The maker of the diabetes
drug Bydureon rejected a $3.5 billion unsolicited takeover bid
from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. earlier this year, two people with
knowledge of the matter said.  Pentair Inc. (PNR)  rallied 15 percent to $46.32. The maker of
Everpure water filters agreed to combine with the  Tyco (TYC) 
International Ltd. division that makes valves and other flow-
control instruments in a deal that values Tyco Flow at $4.53
billion. Tyco increased 4.3 percent to $55.81.  U.S. companies are better positioned for “cashing out”
shareholders than at any other time in more than half a century,
according to Myles Zyblock, chief institutional strategist at
 RBC Capital Markets .  Corporate cash increased by more than $200 billion in each
of the past three years, including a $340.9 billion surge last
year. Companies are poised to sustain the growth rate in their
“cash mountain,” Zyblock wrote two days ago in a report.  Low Rates  Many companies are raising more money through bond sales
because  interest rates  are low, the Toronto-based strategist
wrote. The yield on a Moody’s Investors Service index of Baa
rated corporate debt has averaged 5.2 percent this quarter,
about 0.9 percentage point less than a year earlier.  Increased cash and relatively cheap debt financing will
lead to growth in dividends as well as stock repurchases, the
report said.  Health-care and  technology  companies have the most room to
lift payouts and buy back more shares, Zyblock wrote. The groups
have the highest percentage of cash to assets for non-financial
companies, based on figures for the S&P 500 that he cited.
Energy producers are another possibility, he added, because they
have relatively little debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
