Egypt  plans to sell 27.5 billion
Egyptian pounds ($4.6 billion) of treasury bonds in the next
quarter, the most in a three-month period since the start of
uprisings last year, as yields declined. Dollar bonds dropped.  The government  will offer  three-, five-, seven- and 10-year
securities in the fiscal fourth-quarter starting April,
according to a sale plan on the  finance ministry’s  website
yesterday. Egypt seeks to raise a combined 150 billion pounds
from the sale of bonds and bills in the period. It last sold 10-
year notes in January 2011 at an average yield of 13.04 percent
and sever-year notes to yield 16.88 percent almost two weeks
ago.  The  finance ministry  halted the sale of treasury bonds
after the start of the revolt that ousted President  Hosni Mubarak  more than a year ago to avoid paying higher yields.
Rising borrowing costs forced the government to fall 14 percent
short of the 170 billion pounds it planned to raise this
quarter.  Yields on bills have leveled off in the past month, with
rates on one-year securities dropping 21 basis points from
15.975 percent on Feb. 9, the highest since Bloomberg started
tracking the data in 2006. The yields on the  one-year notes  had
surged 518 basis points, or 5.18 percentage points, since the
start of the demonstrations last year to 15.768 percent at an
auction on March 22.  The central bank on March 20 reduced by two percentage
points the local-currency reserve requirement for banks to help
“ease credit conditions in the market.” The ratio now stands
at 12 percent.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020
advanced 3 basis points to 6.41 percent at 12:40 p.m. in Cairo,
the highest level since March 19, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The Egyptian pound was little-changed at 6.0375 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
