Citigroup Inc. (C)  expanded William Howle’s role in its commercial banking arm, making him the
unit’s U.S. head, as retail bank boss Cecelia “CeCe” Stewart
seeks to reverse a slide in profit.  Howle remains chief operating officer of U.S. consumer and
commercial banking, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Sunil Garg, global head of commercial banking,
previously oversaw the 1,000-employee U.S. unit, according to
Andrew Brent, a spokesman for Citigroup.  Chief Executive Officer  Vikram Pandit  hired Stewart and
Howle from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  in 2010 as part of an overhaul of the
retail bank. Income from continuing operations at the unit
 tumbled  36 percent to $488 million in 2011, Stewart’s first full
year in charge. Revenue fell 4 percent to $5.11 billion.
Citigroup is the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets.  “As our COO, he has shown that he can develop strong teams
and execute with exceptional efficiencies and results,” Stewart
said in the statement. “He will bring the same energy and skill
to his expanded role as we continue to grow our business.”  Howle’s unit provides banking to mid-sized companies and
has increased lending for six consecutive quarters, Citigroup
said in the statement. Citigroup had $6.4 billion of commercial
loans at the end of 2011, according to a filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
