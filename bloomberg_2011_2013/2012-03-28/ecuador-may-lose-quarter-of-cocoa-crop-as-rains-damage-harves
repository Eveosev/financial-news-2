Ecuador ,  Latin America ’s second-
biggest cocoa producer, will lose about a quarter of its crop
this year as floods in the South American nation’s coastal
region damage plants and delay harvests, an export group said.  Cocoa-bean production will likely decline by about 40,000
metric tons to 130,000 tons and the country’s first harvest will
be postponed two months until June, Luis Acosta, chief executive
officer at Exportaciones Acmansa CA, said in an telephone
interview from Guayaquil, Ecuador.  Ecuador, which has been producing the raw ingredient used
to make chocolate for more than 500 years, declared a state of
emergency in five provinces this month after above-average
rainfall in the coastal region and southern Andean foothills
washed away roads and houses and damaged more than 34,000
hectares (84,000 acres) of crops. Rains are expected to last
through May, according to the national weather service.  The harvest “will be much less than last year,” Acosta,
who runs the country’s fifth-largest cocoa exporter, said. “It
will begin in June if the rains stop, for the time being there
is very little cocoa.”  Ecuador exported 164,000 metric tons of  cocoa beans  last
year, according to the country’s National Cocoa Exporters
Association, known as Anecacao. The London-based International
Cocoa Organization, representing 15 producing nations and 29
consuming countries, predicted global output of 3.96 million
tons and demand of 3.99 million tons on Feb. 29.  Brazil  is Latin America’s largest producer of cocoa.
Ecuador is the world’s top grower of flavored beans used in fine
chocolate.  Cocoa futures for May delivery dropped 2.6 percent to
$2,295 a metric ton as of 3:19 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
