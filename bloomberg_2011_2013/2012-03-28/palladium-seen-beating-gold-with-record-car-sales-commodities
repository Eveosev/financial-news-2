Investors are buying palladium at
the fastest pace in more than a year as analysts predict rising
demand and declining supply will turn this quarter’s worst-
performing precious metal into the best by December.  Holdings in palladium-backed exchange-traded products rose
14 percent this year, poised for the best quarter since the end
of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The metal will average
$850 an ounce in the final three months of 2012, 32 percent more
than now, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. They expect a gain of 15 percent for
gold, 13 percent for silver and 11 percent for platinum.  Palladium lagged behind other metals this year on concern
about slowing growth in vehicle sales in  China , the world’s
largest car market. Autocatalysts account for 65 percent of
demand, according to  Barclays Capital . Prices are poised to rise
because carmakers are still using the most metal ever, with the
prospect of shortages because of less supply from state reserves
in  Russia , the biggest producer, the bank estimates.  “I like palladium the best among precious metals, it’s
relatively cheap compared to the others,” said  Bart Melek , the
head of commodity strategy at TD Securities Inc. in Toronto and
the most accurate price forecaster tracked by Bloomberg Rankings
in the eight quarters through the end of 2011. “Autocatalyst
demand for palladium should grow. Russian government stocks will
limit supply growth.”  Mine Production  Palladium fell 1.8 percent to $643.75 in  London  this year,
beaten by all other precious metals for the first time since the
third quarter. Gold rose 5.7 percent, silver 15 percent and
platinum 16 percent. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24
commodities added 6.4 percent and the MSCI All-Country World
 Index (MXWD)  of equities appreciated 10 percent. Treasuries lost 1.2
percent, a Bank of America Corp.  index (MXWD)  shows.  The increase in palladium ETP holdings means investors now
hold 58.9 metric tons, equal to more than eight months of
Russian mine output and valued at about $1.2 billion, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Gold held through ETPs rose 1.4
percent to 2,389.8 tons as platinum increased 8.5 percent to
43.5 tons and silver added 2.5 percent to 17,719 tons.  Sales from Russian reserves, created during a glut in the
1970s and 1980s, will probably drop by 60 percent to 300,000
ounces this year, Barclays estimates. Supply from those
stockpiles, a state secret, won’t exceed 4.5 tons (144,678
ounces) this year or next and may end in 2014, Interfax reported
in October, citing an unidentified Finance Ministry official
linked to Gokhran, the state-run body managing the inventory.  Scrap Metal  Declining Russian sales will combine with the smallest
South African output in three years. Supply from mines and
stockpiles will drop 6.9 percent to 6.91 million ounces this
year, Barclays estimates. An 11 percent expansion in scrap metal
to 2.43 million ounces still won’t be enough to meet demand,
leaving a 215,000-ounce shortage, the bank predicts.  Sales of cars and light commercial vehicles will rise 5.3
percent to a record 79.3 million units this year, according to
LMC Automotive Ltd., a research company in Oxford,  England .
Carmakers will use 6.24 million ounces of palladium in catalytic
converters, 5.5 percent more than in 2011, Barclays estimates.  Actual consumption may be lower after an official of the
China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said March 20 that
volume growth would probably miss its original 2012 target of 8
percent. Car sales had their slowest start to a year since 2005
in January and February, association data show. Premier  Wen Jiabao  cut the country’s annual growth target for gross domestic
product to 7.5 percent this month, the least since 2004.  European Manufacturing  “We think people should be leaning toward monetary assets
rather than industrial,” said James Dailey, who manages $215
million at TEAM Financial Asset Management LLC in Harrisburg,
 Pennsylvania . “If you want to be invested in a metal choose
gold. You don’t want to mess with industrial metals right now.”  At least 59 percent of platinum and palladium is used in
industrial applications from electronics to autocatalysts that
convert emissions into less harmful substances, Johnson Matthey
Plc estimates. Fifty-three percent of silver goes into products
such as solar panels and batteries, according to The Silver
Institute, a Washington-based industry group. About 11 percent
of gold is used in industry, World Gold Council data show.  Catalytic Converters  Shares (GMKN)  of OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s biggest
palladium producer, rose 8.2 percent this year. The Moscow-based
company will report a 4.2 percent decline in net income to $4.49
billion in 2012, according to the average of 12 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Rhodium, a platinum-group metal also used in autocatalysts,
was unchanged at $1,400 an ounce this year, according to London-
based Johnson Matthey, which has made about one in three of the
world’s catalytic converters. Ruthenium climbed 9.1 percent to
$120 an ounce and iridium was unchanged at $1,085 an ounce. Both
are also so-called PGMs.  Platinum is set for its best quarter in three years after
workers at  Impala Platinum Ltd. (IMP) ’s Rustenburg mine, the world’s
biggest, started a month-long strike in January. It will average
$1,800 an ounce in the fourth quarter, the analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg predict. The supply surplus will narrow to 37,000
ounces this year, from 364,000 ounces, according to Barclays.  Platinum now costs more than 2.5 times as much as
palladium, compared with a five-year ratio of 3.6, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Silver is headed for its best quarter in a year, and will
average $36 an ounce in the final three months, the forecasts
compiled by Bloomberg show. Holdings fell by more than 800 tons
in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors may
buy 2,000 tons through ETPs this year, Morgan Stanley predicts.  Central Bank  Gold is advancing for a 12th consecutive year and will
average $1,900 an ounce in the fourth quarter, the analysts
predict. Prices slid more than 7 percent in the past month as
signs that U.S. growth is accelerating pared investors’
expectations the  Federal Reserve  will buy more debt. The central
bank bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of quantitative
easing that ended in June 2011, during which gold appreciated
about 70 percent.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said March 26 that while he’s
encouraged by the decline in the  unemployment rate , continued
accommodative monetary policy will be needed. Gold jumped 1.7
percent. The central bank has pledged to keep  interest rates 
near zero through late 2014. Precious metals generally earn
returns only through price gains, diminishing their allure as
interest rates rise.  U.S. consumer prices increased 2.9 percent in the 12 months
ended in February, the Labor Department reported March 16. While
that’s down from as much as 5.6 percent in 2008, it’s still 2.65
percentage points more than the Fed’s target rate for overnight
loans between banks of zero to 0.25 percent.  “Negative real interest rates are very much a proven
historic driver for the precious metals sector and we can’t see
any sign of that changing any time soon,” said  Charles Morris ,
who oversees about $2.5 billion at HSBC Global Asset Management
in London. “All the factors are lined up for precious metals to
have a run. The big picture is that there’s a ton of money out
there and conditions are very loose around the world.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
