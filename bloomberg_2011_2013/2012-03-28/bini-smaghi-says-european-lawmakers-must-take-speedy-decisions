Former European Central Bank
Executive Board member Lorenzo  Bini Smaghi  said lawmakers must
speed up their decision-making processes to stabilize financial
markets and safeguard the euro.  “For politicians to be credible, it’s important to
anticipate and take decisions early,” Bini Smaghi said in an
interview with  CNBC  broadcast today. “Unfortunately,
politicians have been determined but always too late. It’s too
risky to manage a currency like this.”  At some point, markets will test the resolution of
lawmakers to fix the region’s debt crisis, Bini Smaghi said. The
best strategy to avoid the resurgence of fear on financial
markets is to “clearly identify” the emergency funds available
“and say if needed, theses funds will be used,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
