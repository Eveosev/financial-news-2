Thailand ’s Finance Minister
Kittiratt Na-Ranong comments on the baht and central bank policy.  Kittiratt, who is also the deputy prime minister in charge
of the economy, last week urged the central bank to allow the
baht to weaken and to cut the  benchmark interest rate  by half a
percentage point to help exporters.  He made the comments to reporters in Bangkok today.  “I don’t have a duty to argue with the central bank and
the central bank doesn’t have a duty to argue with me. If they
just listened to me and argued less things would be better
because I am not only the finance minister, I am the one who
looks at the overall economic picture.  “When I signal that I want a weaker baht, that’s because I
really want it that way. I don’t care if people want to slap me.
I don’t want a lot of money to flow in.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
