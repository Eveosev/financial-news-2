Cattle futures fell to an 11-week
low on signs that U.S. demand for beef is weakening. Hogs also
dropped.  Wholesale-beef  prices  have plunged 7.3 percent in March to
$1.8434 a pound, heading for the biggest monthly slide since
October 2008, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. The
market is “struggling with demand,” since prices on Feb. 29
reached the highest since at least January 2004, said  Lane Broadbent , a KIS Futures Inc. vice president in  Oklahoma City .  “The sticker shock is when these people are going to the
store, and they’re going to the meat counter, and their steak
prices are so high that they’re cooking out chicken or pork,”
Broadbent said in a telephone interview.  Cattle futures for June delivery slumped 1.2 percent to
close at $1.205 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching $1.20025, the lowest for a most-active
contract since Jan. 10. The commodity is down 0.8 percent this
year.  Beef Products Inc., which uses beef trimmings to make
ammonia-treated meat referred to in the industry as lean, finely
textured beef, has temporarily suspended operations at three
plants because of consumer concerns about the product, which is
being called “pink slime” by food activists. Eldon Roth, the
company’s chief executive officer, said in a statement that the
product is “100 percent wholesome, safe and nutritious.” The
USDA also reaffirmed the safety of the beef product this month.  The “pink slime connotation” is hurting the market and
may slow beef demand, Broadbent said.  Hog futures for June settlement declined 1.7 percent to
settle at 92.175 cents a pound on the CME. The price has gained
9.3 percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement dropped 0.9
percent to $1.537 a pound in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
