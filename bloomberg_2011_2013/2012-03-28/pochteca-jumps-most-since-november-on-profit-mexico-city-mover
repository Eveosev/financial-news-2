Grupo Pochteca SAB (POCHTECB) , the chemical
maker formerly known as Dermet de Mexico, rose the most since
November after reporting earnings climbed in the first quarter.  The shares jumped 6.5 percent to 2.12 pesos at 1:25 p.m. in
Mexico City, the biggest intraday increase since Nov. 17. The
 IRT Small Capitalization (IRTSMALL)  index of 20 Mexican companies including
Pochteca was little changed.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization -- a measure known as Ebitda -- rose 11 percent to
41 million pesos ($3.2 million) in the first quarter, according
to preliminary results sent yesterday to the Mexican stock
exchange. A “better product mix” helped push up sales 3
percent to 1 billion pesos, the  Mexico  City-based company said.  “Despite all the increases in costs, they’re staying
profitable and that’s very good,”  Gerardo Copca , an analyst
with Metanalisis SA in Mexico City, said today in a telephone
interview. “Although it doesn’t trade a lot, you’re seeing
interest today from various investors.”  Volume was 296 percent of the three-month daily average.
Brokerage Banorte-Ixe Casa de Bolsa executed the most buy orders
on the day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A planned capital increase approved by shareholders on
March 15 will bring the company’s pro forma ratio of net debt to
Ebitda to 1.8 times, within its target of two times, the company
said. Without the capital increase, it would be 3 times,
according to Pochteca.  To contact the reporter on this story:
