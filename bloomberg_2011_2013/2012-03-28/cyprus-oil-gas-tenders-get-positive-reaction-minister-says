Cyprus received “a positive
reaction” from energy companies seeking to participate in a
second round of bidding for licenses to explore offshore for oil
and gas, Neoklis Sylikiotis, Cyprus’s Commerce and Industry
Minister said.  “The interest is higher than for the first licensing
round,” Sylikiotis said at a conference in  Athens  today, adding
that Chinese companies have submitted proposals for construction
of a gas facility in Cyprus.  The bidding deadline is May 11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
