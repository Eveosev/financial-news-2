German stocks  declined after orders
for durable goods in the U.S. rose less than estimated and
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that it’s too
early to “declare victory” in the economic recovery.  Praktiker AG plunged 14 percent after posting a larger loss
than analysts had projected. Pfleiderer AG plummeted 45 percent
after the company said it’s preparing to file for insolvency.  The benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index dropped 1.1 percent to 6,998.8 at
the close in  Frankfurt . The gauge has still  rallied 19 percent
this year  amid optimism that the euro area will contain its debt
crisis and as U.S. economic reports topped estimates. The
broader HDAX Index lost 1.2 percent today.  “There’s been a few bits of negative news that I think the
markets have grabbed onto overnight,”  James Hughes , a senior
market analyst at Alpari Ltd. in  London , said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “It could just be a be a blip; we have
seen a pretty good run after all.”  A preliminary report showed that  Germany ’s  consumer price
inflation , calculated using a harmonized European Union method,
slowed to 2.3 percent in March from 2.5 percent in February.
That matched the  median of 24 economist forecasts  in a Bloomberg
News survey.  U.S. Durable Orders  In the U.S., orders for  durable goods in the world’s
largest economy  rose in February less than economists had
estimated. Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
advanced 2.2 percent, a report from the Commerce Department
showed today. Economists had predicted a 3 percent gain,
according to the  median forecast  in a Bloomberg News survey.  Bernanke said in remarks published yesterday that the
 unemployment rate  in the U.S. remained too high and policy
makers don’t rule out further measures to boost growth.  “It’s far too early to declare victory,” Bernanke said in
a transcript of an interview with ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer
provided by the network.  Praktiker (PRA)  tumbled 14 percent to 1.81 euros, its biggest
decline this month. Germany’s third-largest home improvement
retailer posted a loss of 554.7 million euros ($737 million) in
2011 as the company wrote down inventory, took impairments on
non-current assets and set aside money for contracts. That
compared with a loss of 33.6 million euros in 2010.  Pfleiderer AG (PFD4)  plunged 45 percent to 19.2 euro cents, its
biggest drop since at least 1998, after the German maker of
wood-based panels for furniture and interior fittings said it’s
preparing to file for insolvency.  Solarworld, Hochtief  Solarworld AG (SWV)  sank 6.6 percent to 2.71 euros as Bank of
America Corp. said the company’s margins will come under
pressure from Chinese competition and lower subsidies in
Germany.  Wacker Chemie AG (WCH) , the  second-largest maker of solar-
grade silicon , fell 3.5 percent to 67.04 euros.  Hochtief AG (HOT) ,  Germany’s biggest construction company ,
retreated 3.2 percent to 48.66 euros.  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX)  advanced 1.8 percent to 7.69
euros.  Europe’s second-largest semiconductor maker  had its
share-price estimate raised by 30 percent to 9.50 euros at Exane
BNP Paribas.  IVG Immobilien AG (IVG)  rallied 13 percent to 2.62 euros after
the  German real-estate company  predicted that it will break even
in 2012 and make a profit in 2013. The company reported a pretax
loss of 217.6 million euros for 2011.  Centrotherm Photovoltaics AG (CTN) , a manufacturer of solar
equipment, gained 1.9 percent to 10.78 euros as WestLB AG
upgraded the stock to add from neutral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
