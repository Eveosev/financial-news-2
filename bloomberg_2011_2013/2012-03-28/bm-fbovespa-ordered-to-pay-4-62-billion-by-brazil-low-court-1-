BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) ,  Brazil ’s biggest
securities exchange, said a local lower court ordered it to pay
8.42 billion reais ($4.62 billion) in a civil case related to
central bank futures trading around the time of the 1999
 currency devaluation .  The exchange said it’s being accused of causing losses for
the public coffers, according to a regulatory filing late
yesterday. The Sao Paulo-based company denied wrongdoing and
said it will appeal the decision.  BM&FBovespa said it doesn’t plan to set aside money as
provision for the case because its attorneys assign a low
probability that the unfavorable ruling will be upheld by higher
courts.  The exchange said it’s being accused of administrative
irregularities after the central bank traded currency futures
contracts on the BM&FBovespa to prevent the real from devaluing
in January 1999.  The ruling refers to multiple lawsuits brought by Brazilian
citizens, the exchange said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
