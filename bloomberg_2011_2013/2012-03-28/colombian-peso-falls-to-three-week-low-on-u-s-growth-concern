Colombia ’s peso fell to a three-
week low as weaker-than-forecast U.S. economic data damped
optimism that demand for Latin American exports will grow.  The peso dropped 0.6 percent to 1,774.50 per  U.S. dollar  in
Bogota, from 1,763.80 yesterday. It earlier touched 1,775.53,
the weakest level since March 7. The loss curbed this year’s
advance to 9.2 percent, the biggest gain among major Latin
American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Durable goods orders in the U.S., the world’s biggest
economy, increased 2.2 percent, less than analysts projected,
after a revised 3.6 percent decline the prior month, a
government report showed today. Demand for the peso has also
faded this week after the central bank refrained from raising
benchmark  interest rates  for a third straight month at a March
23 meeting, curbing the allure of the country’s fixed-income
assets.  “As rates weren’t increased, investors stop considering
the local currency attractive in the short term,” said  David
Cohen , a strategist at brokerage Ultrabursatiles SA in Bogota.  The central bank held the benchmark rate at 5.25 percent on
March 23 after increases at both their January and February
meetings. Policy makers kept borrowing costs unchanged as they
seek to gauge whether nine interest rate increases in 13 months
will be enough to prevent the fastest economic growth since 2007
from stoking inflation.  The yield on the country’s 10 percent peso-denominated
bonds due in 2024 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 7.24 percent in Bogota, according to the central bank.  Auction Results  Yields on Colombian peso bonds due August 2026 fell to
7.392 percent at a government auction of fixed-rate securities
today. The yield on the bonds declined from 7.42 percent at the
last auction on March 14.  Colombia also sold bonds due October 2018 to yield 6.75
percent, down from 6.8 percent, while the yield on the June 2016
securities fell to 6.36 percent from 6.48 percent, the  Finance
Ministry  said in a statement.  Investor demand for the fixed-rate securities totaled 1.32
trillion pesos ($745 million), more than 3 times the 400 billion
pesos of debt offered, the ministry said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
