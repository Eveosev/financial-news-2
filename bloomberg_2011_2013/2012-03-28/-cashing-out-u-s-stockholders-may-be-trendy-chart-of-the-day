U.S. companies are better
positioned for “cashing out” shareholders than at any other
time in more than half a century, according to Myles Zyblock,
chief institutional strategist at  RBC Capital Markets .  The CHART OF THE DAY shows cash and other liquid assets as
a percentage of corporations’ total assets, based on quarterly
data compiled by the  Federal Reserve . Last quarter’s reading was
7.5 percent, the highest since 1959.  Corporate cash increased by more than $200 billion in each
of the past three years, including a $340.9 billion surge last
year. Companies are poised to sustain the growth rate in their
“cash mountain,” Zyblock wrote two days ago in a report that
featured a similar chart.  Many companies are raising more money through bond sales
because  interest rates  are low, the Toronto-based strategist
wrote. The yield on a Moody’s Investors Service index of Baa
rated corporate debt has averaged 5.2 percent this quarter,
about 0.9 percentage point less than a year earlier.  Increased cash and relatively cheap debt financing will
lead to growth in dividends as well as stock repurchases, the
report said.  Health-care and technology companies have the most room to
lift payouts and buy back more shares, Zyblock wrote. The groups
have the highest percentage of cash to assets for non-financial
companies, based on figures for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
that he cited. Energy producers are another possibility, he
added, because they have relatively little debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
