South Korea  returned to a current-
account surplus in February as exports rose amid signs of an
improving U.S. economy and as the euro zone debt crisis eased.  The surplus was $639 million, compared with a revised $969
million deficit in January, the  Bank of Korea  said in Seoul
today. The current account is the broadest measure of trade,
tracking goods, services and investment income.  South Korean manufacturers’ confidence rose to the highest
level in six months and the consumer sentiment index climbed to
a four-month high on signs that the outlook for global growth is
improving. While the  European Central Bank ’s injection of more
than 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) into the banking system
has calmed markets, the best six months of job growth since 2006
in the U.S. are boosting the optimism of consumers whose
spending accounts for 70 percent of the economy.  “Global recession fears are fading, which bodes well for
Korean exporters,” Kong Dong Rak, a Seoul-based fixed-income
analyst at Taurus Investment & Securities Co., said before the
release. “Unless  oil prices  jump further too much, South Korea
will continue to see a  trade surplus , which should help boost
the won.”  The won slid 0.1 percent to close at 1,135.40 per dollar in
Seoul yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Kospi Index lost 0.4 percent.  Traded Goods Surplus  The surplus on traded goods was $1.4 billion last month,
compared with a revised $1.6 billion deficit in January, today’s
report showed.  Total exports on a customs-cleared basis rose 20.6 percent
from a year earlier to $46.4 billion in February, according to
today’s statement. Imports increased 23.3 percent to $44.9
billion on higher oil prices.  Overseas shipments may rise 1.3 percent in March from a
year ago, according to a median estimate of 11 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  The BOK forecast in December that the economy will grow 3.7
percent in 2012 and 4.2 percent in 2013. The country’s current-
account surplus is expected to narrow to $13 billion this year
from $26.5 billion in 2011, according to the projections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
