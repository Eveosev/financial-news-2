ZTE Corp. (763) , China’s second-biggest
maker of phone equipment, said full-year profit fell 37 percent,
missing analysts’ estimates, as research and marketing costs
surged.  Net income  fell to 2.06 billion yuan ($327 million), from a
restated 3.25 billion yuan a year earlier, the Shenzhen-based
company said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange
yesterday. That missed the 2.78 billion yuan average of 10
analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  ZTE increased spending and offered discounts to boost sales
of mobile-phones to compete with rivals including Huawei
Technologies Co. ZTE’s  shipments  of smartphones surged fivefold
to more than 12 million units last year, bolstered by the
popularity of low-cost models such as the V880 Blade, the
company said in January.  “Handset revenues should continue to grow driven by strong
smartphone sales,” Alan Hellawell, a Hong Kong-based analyst at
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  who rates the shares buy, wrote in a report
March 27.  China ’s interest rate increases last year also pushed
up ZTE’s borrowing costs, he wrote.  Research and development costs rose to 8.5 billion yuan
from 7.1 billion yuan a year earlier, ZTE said. Selling and
distribution costs climbed to 11.1 billion yuan from 8.9 billion
yuan.  ZTE rose 0.7 percent to HK$20.05 at the close in Hong Kong
trading yesterday, before the earnings announcement. The  shares 
have declined 18 percent this year, even as the benchmark  Hang
Seng Index  climbed 13 percent.  Revenue jumped 23 percent to 86.3 billion yuan from 69.9
billion yuan last year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
