Swiss Re (SREN)  Ltd., the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, said natural catastrophes cost the  insurance
industry  $110 billion last year after record flooding and
earthquake losses.  At $49 billion, 2011 was the costliest year in terms of
insured earthquake losses after temblors in Japan and  New
Zealand , while floods in  Thailand  caused $12 billion of losses,
“the highest insured losses ever for a single flood event,”
the Zurich-based company said in an e-mailed statement. Claims
from man-made disasters were $6 billion.  Economic losses from natural catastrophes and man-made
disasters stood at $370 billion, compared with $226 billion the
year before, mainly driven by the magnitude-9 earthquake and the
subsequent tsunami that hit the coast of Tohoku, east Japan on
March 11 last year.  “Two-thirds of the staggering $370 billion in economic
damage will be shouldered by corporations, governments, relief
organizations, and ultimately individuals, pointing to the still
widespread lack of insurance protection worldwide,” said Swiss
Re’s chief economist,  Kurt Karl .  The  Japan  quake cost the industry $35 billion, making it
the most expensive earthquake on record. The insurance industry
will bear only 17 percent of that cost because of Japan’s low
earthquake insurance protection, Swiss Re said.  “Had Japan been more fully insured, 2011 would certainly
have been the most expensive year ever also in terms of insured
losses,” according to Lucia Bevere, a senior catastrophe data
analyst at the reinsurer.  With $123 billion in insured losses, 2005 remains the
costliest year for the industry following hurricanes Katrina,
Wilma and Rita.  In addition to the quakes and floods, an “unparalleled”
tornado season in the U.S. caused claims of $25 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
