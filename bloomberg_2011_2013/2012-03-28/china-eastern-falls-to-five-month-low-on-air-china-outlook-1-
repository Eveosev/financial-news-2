China Eastern Airlines Corp. (CEA) , the
nation’s second-largest carrier by passenger numbers, fell to a
five-month low in New York as larger competitor  Air China Ltd. (753) 
said passenger growth may slow this year and on a report that
the government may raise jet fuel prices for April.  China Eastern  dropped for a second day in U.S. trading,
losing 1.7 percent at the close of trading in New York to
$16.54, the lowest price since Oct. 20. Shares traded totaled
62,841, or 384 percent of the stock’s average three-month
volume, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Air  China , the
world’s biggest airline by market value, fell 0.2 percent to
HK$5.11 in  Hong Kong .  Beijing-based Air China predicted that passenger growth may
slow to 4.4 percent this year, from 16 percent in 2011, after
reporting that net income declined 41 percent last year to 7.08
billion yuan ($1.1 billion). The carrier was expected to post
2011 profit of 8.9 billion yuan, based on the average of eight
 analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “The demand is there though costs have to come down” for
airlines, said David Semple, director of international equity at
the Van Eck Emerging Markets Fund in  New York , which oversees
$35 billion of assets, including Chinese stocks. “Clearly, fuel
fears are also playing a large part in this.”  China may raise jet fuel  prices  for April by 330 yuan a ton
to 8,099 yuan, Xinhua08.Com, the financial information website
of the official Xinhua News Agency, reported on March 26, citing
Zhongyu Information analyst Wang Jintao. Airlines may increase
passenger fuel surcharges by 10 yuan, according to the site.  Shanghai-based China Eastern’s  net income  fell 7.7 percent
to 4.58 billion yuan in 2011, the airline said on March 25,
citing “cost increases and general downturn in the global
aviation industry.” That missed the 5.1 billion-yuan average of
eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
