General Motors Co. (GM) , the world’s
largest automaker, named Alfred Rieck as sales chief of Opel as
the company attempts to end losses in  Europe , where auto demand
is forecast to fall for the fifth straight year.  Rieck, who will be a member of Opel’s supervisory board,
takes over his new position on July 1. He had been president of
VW’s Skoda China, where he led the introduction of the brand in
that market and held other VW management posts in Europe. He
replaces Alain Visser, who is leaving the company, GM said.  Opel’s board met today, the company said in a  statement .
The board is working on a plan to return the European unit,
including the Vauxhall brand in the U.K., to profitability. GM
intends to make more cost cuts in the region after its last
revamping effort failed to end deficits.  GM Europe  lost $747
million last year before taxes and interest.  “All parties around the table agree that Opel/Vauxhall
needs to return to profitability and to take action to increase
revenues, improve margins and reduce costs,” Opel’s statement
said. “To that extent, the parties are committed to continue
the dialogue with each other in order to identify the best
possible strategy to improve the company’s financial
performance.”  GM’s factories in Ellesmere Port, England, and Bochum,
Germany, may be at risk to be closed, analysts, including  Brian Johnson  with  Barclays Capital , have said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
