Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS
and EP Investment Advisors were fined 2.5 million euros ($3.3
million) by European Union regulators for obstructing a 2009
antitrust investigation into the Czech  electricity market .  The European Commission said the companies failed to block
an e-mail account and diverted incoming mails “in breach of
their obligations to cooperate” with regulators during
antitrust inspections, according to an e-mailed statement today.  EPH will consider an appeal to the EU courts after it has
studied the decision, said spokesman Martin Manak in an e-mailed
statement. EP Investment Advisors was previously named J&T
Investment Advisors, the EU said.  Regulators previously fined Suez Environnement and E.On AG
for breaking seals attached to office doors during separate
surprise inspections. The EU can fine companies as much as 1
percent of yearly revenue for failing, intentionally or
negligently, to block an inspection or refusing to produce
evidence during a raid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
