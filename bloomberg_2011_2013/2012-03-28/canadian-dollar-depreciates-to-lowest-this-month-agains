Canada ’s dollar declined to the
lowest level this month against the euro on speculation European
leaders will contain the debt crisis and as concern about global
growth saps demand for higher-risk assets.  The Canadian currency dropped versus a majority of its
most-traded peers as crude oil, the nation’s largest export,
fell for a second day and an index of global stocks was little
changed. Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  will deliver the nation’s
federal budget tomorrow.  “We’re a bit more cautious” on commodity currencies, said
 Geoffrey Yu , a currency analyst at UBS AG in  London , in a
telephone interview. “We see dollar-Canada stronger,” he said,
referring to a rising greenback.  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, was unchanged at
C$1.3246 versus the 17-nation common currency at 10:21 a.m. in
Toronto, after touching the weakest since Feb. 29. Against the
 U.S. dollar  it was little changed at 99.57 cents. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0043.  Yu predicted the loonie will weaken to C$1.05 versus the
U.S. dollar by the end of 2012. It will appreciate to C$1.20
against the euro, he forecast.  “We still see the euro lower,” said Yu. “The driver will
still be negative growth surprises.”  Government bonds  were little changed, with the yield on
benchmark 10-year security rising one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.13 percent. Canadian 10-year debt yielded
six basis points lower than equivalent-maturity U.S. bonds, from
nine basis points lower on March 14, the widest spread since
April.  Flaherty Budget  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed and
crude oil, Canada’s biggest export, dropped 1.1 percent to
$105.61 per barrel in  New York .  Flaherty said earlier this month that his 2012 budget, to
be released tomorrow in Ottawa, will focus primarily on
bolstering growth in a bid to sustain the country’s recovery,
rather than spending cuts.  The finance minister will report a deficit of between C$20
billion ($20.1 billion) and C$25 billion for the fiscal year
ending this week, compared with an earlier forecast of C$31
billion, and will forecast bringing the country back to budget
balance by the end of the 2015-16 fiscal year, a year ahead of
schedule,  Mark Chandler , Ian Pollick and Paul Borean,
strategists in Toronto at  RBC Capital Markets , wrote in a March
26 note to clients.  Relative Performance  The loonie’s 2.7 percent gain over the past six months is
the third-best performance among 10 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. The Australian
dollar leads with an advance of 5.1 percent, and the  New Zealand
dollar  is second-best at 4.4 percent higher.  Against the U.S. dollar, the loonie is headed for a 2.3
percent gain this quarter and a 0.6 percent loss this month. It
rose 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter last year, after dropping
8.3 percent in the third.  The loonie has traded in a range of about 2 cents since the
end of January, when it traded at C$1.0054 per U.S. dollar
before appreciating to 98.42 cents on March 1 on optimism the
euro-zone debt crisis was receding. The currency has averaged
about C$1.0050 over two years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. dollar has breached the 50-day moving average at
99.70 cents, “however it remains near the center of a two-month
range,” Eric Theoret, a currency strategist in Toronto at Bank
of  Nova Scotia ’s Scotia Capital unit, wrote in a note to clients
today. “Significant resistance is expected at the 200-day
moving average,” he said, which he cited as C$1.007. resistance
refers to the upper boundary of a trading range, where sell
orders may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
