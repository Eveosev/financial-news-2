AAA Auto Group NV (AAA) , a Czech chain of
used-car dealerships, rose for a second day to a six-month high
before the publication of 2011 earnings scheduled for tomorrow.  The stock jumped as much as 4.5 percent to 19.60 koruna,
its highest since Sept. 27, and traded up 1.8 percent at 19.10
koruna by 3:40 p.m. in Prague. That made AAA Auto the best
performer in the  PX (PX)  equity gauge, which fell 0.7 percent today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
