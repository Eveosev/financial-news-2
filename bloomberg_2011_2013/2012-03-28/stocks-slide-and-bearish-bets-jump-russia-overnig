Russian stocks dropped in U.S.
trading for the first time in three days and bearish bets on the
nation’s equities rose to a 20-month high as crude oil, the
country’s top export earner, declined.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of Russian stocks
listed in  New York  slipped 0.9 percent to 108.51 yesterday, led
by  OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) ,  Russia ’s biggest lender, and coking coal
producer OAO Mechel. The  ratio  of outstanding puts to sell the
Market Vectors Russia exchange-traded fund, a U.S.-listed ETF
that holds Russian shares, versus calls to buy rose to 2.2-to-1
yesterday, the highest level since July 2010, according to
preliminary data compiled by Bloomberg. Futures on the  RTS  Index
expiring in June fell 0.5 percent to 164,375 in the U.S.  Brent, the oil type which underpins prices for Russia’s
Urals crude, fell yesterday after Charles McConnell, acting
assistant for fossil energy at the U.S. Energy Department, said
the nation is considering releasing supplies from its strategic
reserves. Sales of oil and gas provided almost 50 percent of the
Russian government’s revenue last year and make up 17 percent of
gross domestic product. Three of the  biggest  five stocks on the
Russia-US measure are energy shares.  “It’s hard for Russia to rally when the oil price is
down,” Ian Hague, who manages Russian equities as a partner at
Firebird Asset Management, which oversees $1.3 billion, said by
phone in New York yesterday. “The Russian market follows the
oil prices.”  OAO Lukoil (LUKOY) , Russia’s biggest non-state oil producer, lost
0.6 percent to $63.40 in New York yesterday, after trading
little changed at 1,846.40 rubles, or $63.58, on Moscow’s  Micex
Index. (INDEXCF)  One depositary receipt is equal to one ordinary share.  Urals Crude Forecast  OAO Gazprom Neft (GZPFY) , the oil arm of Russia’s natural gas
export monopoly, fell 0.3 percent to $26.76 in U.S. trading,
while the Moscow-based company’s Micex stock added 0.9 percent
to 155.69 rubles, or $5.36.  Russia’s Economy Ministry may increase its forecast for
Urals crude to average about $100 a barrel, from the current
prediction for $97, the RIA Novosti newswire reported yesterday,
citing Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach .  Crude oil for May delivery rose 0.3 percent to $107.33 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since March 19, as confidence among U.S. consumers in
March held close to a one-year high. Futures have gained 8.6
percent this year after increasing 25 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2011.  Brent oil for May settlement fell 0.1 percent to settle at
$125.54 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Urals
crude, Russia’s chief export blend, lost 0.3 percent to $122
yesterday.  ‘Tremendous Rally’  The 30-stock  Micex Index (MICEX)  slid 0.7 percent to 1,554.28
yesterday in Moscow. The dollar-denominated RTS fell 0.8 percent
to 1,699.68. The Bloomberg Russia-US measure rallied 1.2 percent
to the highest level in a week on March 26.  “We’ve had a tremendous rally in the Russian market in the
last few days,”  Alec Young , global equity strategist at S&P
Capital IQ, said by phone. “After a big up day, you generally
see some profit-taking.”  Sberbank’s (SBRCY)  American depositary receipts tumbled 3 percent
to $13.45 in New York, while the stock fell 2.2 percent to 97.84
rubles, or $3.37, in Moscow. One depositary receipt is equal to
four ordinary shares.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX)  fell 1.7 percent to $31.54
yesterday, the biggest one-day drop since March 22. The  RTS
Volatility Index (RTSVX) , which measures expected swings in the index
futures, added 0.8 percent to 31.12.  ADRs of Moscow-based Mechel, Russia’s largest producer of
coal for steelmakers, fell 2.4 percent to $9.70 in New York
yesterday, the lowest close since March 6.  Mechel Violations  Russia’s environmental watchdog said yesterday it will
complete a review of Mechel’s Yakutugol coal division next week,
after the Natural Resources Ministry reported “significant”
license violations by the unit operating in the nation’s  Far
East .  The watchdog is preparing a report and will submit it to
the Subsoil Resource Agency, which oversees licensing, after the
inspections are completed on April 4, the regulator known as
Rosprirodnadzor said yesterday in a statement on its website.
Both oversight bodies are part of the ministry.  Rosprirodnadzor replaced an earlier statement on its
website, removing a line that said reports of “significant”
license violations at the coal-mining unit were “erroneous.”  Mechel didn’t see where it could have significant
violations and expected to resolve any issues after getting the
report, Ekaterina Videman, a company spokeswoman, said on March
22.  Commodities Slip  The company’s  ADRs (MTL)  are trading at a 2.9 percent discount to
its Moscow shares, the widest gap since March 5, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Mechel (MTLR)  rose 1.4 percent to 290 rubles, or
$9.99, on the Micex yesterday. One New York-listed ADR is equal
to one ordinary share traded in Moscow.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI index  of 24 raw materials fell
0.1 percent to 704.24 yesterday. Nickel and lead declined in
 London . Aluminum sank 0.4 percent today after rising 0.5 percent  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
slumped 4.7 percent to HK$5.52 in Hong Kong trading as of the
noon break. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.6 percent today
as profit reports showed earnings are worsening in  China .  OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY) , Russia’s biggest fixed-line phone provider,
slipped 1.6 percent to $30.40 in New York yesterday, the biggest
one-day drop since March 22.  Rostelecom (RTKM)  dropped 0.6 percent to
147.07 rubles, or $5.06, on the Micex. One ADR of Rostelecom is
equal to six ordinary shares.  Controlling Stake  Rostelecom and OAO MegaFon may purchase  Alexander Mamut ’s
controlling stake in Russian mobile-phone retailer Euroset
Holding NV, the Kommersant newspaper  reported  yesterday.  Mamut may be paid in part with 100 percent of SUP Media,
currently owned by billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who controls 31
percent of MegaFon, the Moscow-based newspaper reported, citing
an investment banker and unidentified people close to the
companies’ shareholders.  The sale may be completed in two to three months,
Kommersant said, citing one of the unidentified people.
 VimpelCom (VIP)  Ltd., which controls 49.9 percent of Euroset, didn’t
use an option to acquire an additional 24.95 percent stake, the
newspaper reported.  VimpelCom lost 0.5 percent yesterday in New York to $10.95.  To contact the reporters on this story:
