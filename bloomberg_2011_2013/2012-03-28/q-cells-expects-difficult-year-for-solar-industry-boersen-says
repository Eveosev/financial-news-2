Q-Cells SE (QCE)  expects another “very
difficult” year for the solar industry as overcapacity
continues to weigh on pricing, Boersen Zeitung reported, citing
an interview with Chief Executive Officer Nedim Cen.  “We will all burn a lot of money in 2012,” Cen is cited
as saying. The solar panel maker plans to be debt-free by the
summer helped by a financing restructuring, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
