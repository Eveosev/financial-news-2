Aegean Airlines SA (AEGN)  posted a wider
loss in 2011 from a year earlier amid higher fuel costs and
continued weak demand for travel from Greek customers.  The loss widened to 27.2 million euros ($36.2 million) from
23.3 million euros in 2010, according to an e-mailed statement
from the Athens-based carrier today. Sales rose 13 percent to
668 million euros. Fuel costs increased 51 percent to 184
million euros.  International passenger traffic rose 15 percent in 2011 to
3.5 million passengers as the company expanded outside Greece.
Domestic passengers declined 6 percent as Greeks cut back
travel. The carrier invested in additional slots in  London  and
Paris and has 166.8 million euros in cash and cash equivalents.  Greece ’s gross domestic product shrank 6.9 percent in 2011,
the Hellenic Statistical Authority said. The economy is mired in
a fifth year of recession and unemployment in December reached a
record 21 percent. The country has agreed to a new wave of
austerity measures including wage and pension cuts in exchange
for a second bailout package worth 130 billion euros from the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund .  The environment in the first quarter of 2012 “continues to
be weak with a further drop in demand,” Aegean said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
