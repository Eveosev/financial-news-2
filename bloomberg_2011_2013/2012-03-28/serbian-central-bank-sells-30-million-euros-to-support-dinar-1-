The Serbian central bank sold euros
to support the dinar, acting for the second consecutive day to
slow the national currency’s weakening.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije sold 30 million
euros ($39.86 million) to “enable smooth functioning of the
foreign-exchange market,” it said in a statement posted on its
website. It has sold 415.5 million euros since the start of 2012
to prop up the dinar.  Earlier in the day, three currency traders, who asked for
anonymity in line with their bank policies, said the central
bank started selling euros when the dinar fell to 111.50 to the
euro, with client demand for foreign currencies keeping it under
pressure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
