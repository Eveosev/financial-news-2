Estonia’s central bank should
increase reserves as European monetary-policy makers make “non-
standard loans” to help tackle their debt crisis, Deputy
Governor Ulo Kaasik said.  The  European Central Bank ’s decision to issue three-year
loans to commercial banks has heightened risks to regional
central banks’ balance sheets, according to Kaasik. Estonia
adopted the euro last year.  Estonian policy makers “must find ways to increase
reserves,” he said today in an e-mailed statement. The
stockpile is three times less than the euro-region average,
adjusting for the Baltic nation’s contribution to the ECB
measures, he added.  A decision on whether to bolster reserves will probably be
taken when the central bank’s supervisory board next meets on
April 10, according to Chairman Jaan Mannik. “This is about
distributing last year’s profit,” he said today in a phone
interview.  Reserves were 374 million euros ($497 million) at the end
of last year, Viljar Raask, a spokesman for the central bank,
said today by phone. Estonia has contributed 0.18 percent of the
ECB’s capital, according to the Frankfurt-based central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
