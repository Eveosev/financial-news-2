U.K. wheat availability and
consumption remain “finely balanced” as domestic use declines
and exports remain “strong,” the Home-Grown Cereals Authority
said.  Wheat available for export and storage may total 2.62
million metric tons, up 3.2 percent from a forecast at the
beginning of the year, according to the report e-mailed today.
About 1.8 million tons of the wheat was exported by the end of
January, the Kenilworth, England-based HGCA said.  “What we’ve seen is exports have been strong,” Charlotte
Garbutt, the author of the report, said by phone today. “Much
of that 2.62 million tons will be exported and the remainder
could be carried over as stocks.”  In total, about 17.7 million tons of wheat is expected to
be available this year and 13.7 million tons may be consumed
domestically, the HGCA said.  About 6.45 million tons may be used for  animal feed , down
0.5 percent from January’s estimate, HGCA data show. Human and
industrial consumption was forecast 0.7 percent lower at 6.85
million tons, as less may be used to make bioethanol, according
to the report.  Exports last year totaled 2.66 million tons. The HGCA would
not give an export forecast for the 2011-12 marketing year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
