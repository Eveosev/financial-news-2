Crude oil options volatility rose
as underlying futures declined after oil inventories climbed the
most in 20 months and Western nations considered releasing oil
from strategic reserves.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 24.5 percent as of 4 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , up from 24.1 percent yesterday.  Crude futures slipped after the Energy department reported
that  stockpiles   rose  7.1 million barrels to 353.4 million last
week, the largest increase since July 2010. French Industry
Minister Eric Besson said the U.S. government has proposed
releasing fuel from strategic stockpiles.  “You’ve got this big crude build and the possibility of an
SPR release,” said  David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor
Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in Houston. “Where would you put it
and who’s going to be the buyer? You won’t have a draw in the
shoulder season when units are down for spring maintenance, so
you’re going to keep building.”  The Obama administration hasn’t decided whether to release
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or made any specific
proposal to allies,  Josh Earnest , deputy White House press
secretary, said at a briefing today in  Washington .  Crude Futures Fall  Crude for May delivery fell $1.92 to $105.21 a barrel on
the Nymex, the lowest level since March 22. Prices are up 6.7
percent this year on concern that tensions with  Iran  over its
nuclear program may reduce global crude oil supplies.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were
May $95 puts, which rose 8 cents to 19 cents a barrel at 4:11
p.m. with 2,635 contracts trading. May $100 puts were the
second-most active with 2,445 lots changing hands. They advanced
23 cents to 66 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 55 percent of electronic trading volume.
