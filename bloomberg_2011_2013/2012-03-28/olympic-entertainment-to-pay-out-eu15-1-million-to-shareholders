Olympic Entertainment Group AS (OEG1T) ,
eastern  Europe ’s only publicly traded casino operator, proposed
a payout of 15.1 million euros ($20 million) from a share
capital reduction.  Olympic will reduce share capital by 21 million euros to
60.5 million euros, the company said in a regulatory statement
late yesterday. Six million euros will be transferred to
retained earnings to cover accumulated losses. The list of
investors participating in the capital reduction will be fixed
on May 4.  The company said yesterday it won’t pay a dividend for 2011
as it has no retained earnings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
