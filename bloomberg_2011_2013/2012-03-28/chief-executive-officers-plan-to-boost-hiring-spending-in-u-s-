Chief executive officers plan to
increase  capital spending  and hiring over the next six months as
they turned more optimistic about the  U.S. economy , a survey
showed.  The Business Roundtable’s  economic outlook  index increased
to 96.9 in the first quarter from 77.9 in the previous three
months, the Washington-based trade group reported today.
Readings greater than 50 are consistent with economic expansion,
and this quarter’s measure is the highest since April-June 2011.  Eighty-one percent of business leaders expect sales to rise
in the next six months, up from 68 percent in the previous
quarter. An increase in capital spending is projected by 48
percent of respondents, up from 32 percent.  Forty-two percent said they will increase payrolls,
compared with 35 percent in the prior quarter, while 43 percent
plan to hold their staffing levels steady.  The survey, taken March 1-19, represented the responses of
128 company leaders. The  Business Roundtable  is an association
of chief executives of corporations with a combined workforce of
more than 14 million employees and more than $6 trillion in
annual revenue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
