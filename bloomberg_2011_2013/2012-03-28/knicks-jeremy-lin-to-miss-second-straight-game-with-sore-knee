New York Knicks point guard Jeremy
Lin won’t play tonight against the  Orlando Magic , the second
straight game he’ll miss because of a sore left knee, the team
said on its website.  Lin also sat out the Knicks’ win against the  Milwaukee
Bucks  two days ago and said he won’t return until he’s fully
recovered. The Harvard University graduate is averaging 14.6
points and 6.1 assists this season.  The Knicks, who have won seven of their past eight games,
are also without forward Amar’e Stoudemire, who will miss two to
four weeks with a bulging disk in his lower back.  The Magic (32-18) have the third-best record in the
 National Basketball Association ’s Eastern Conference, while the
Knicks are in eighth place with a 25-25 record. The top eight
teams in the conference make the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
