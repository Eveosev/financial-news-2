Malaysia ’s ringgit weakened,
halting a three-day gain, on concern slowing growth in China
will damp demand for exports from the Southeast Asian nation.
Bonds declined.  The MSCI Asia-Pacific  index  of shares dropped after
industrial companies in the world’s second-largest economy and
Malaysia’s biggest overseas market posted their first January-
February profit declines since 2009. The ringgit has slid 2.6
percent this month after official data released on March 7
showed annual  export  growth slumped to 0.4 percent in January
from 6.1 percent in December.  The ringgit weakened 0.2 percent to 3.0633 per dollar as of
4:27 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It advanced 3.6 percent this quarter, the second-best
performance among  Asia ’s 11 most-used currencies.  “The China slowdown concern is hurting Asian currencies,”
said Azmi Shukri Rahman, a foreign-exchange trader at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The Malaysian currency
will likely trade between 3.055 and 3.075 today.”  The ringgit’s one-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, retreated 10 basis
points to 7.30 percent.  Ten-year government bonds fell. The yield on the 3.418
percent bonds due August 2022 increased four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 3.68 percent, according to Bursa
Malaysia. That’s the highest since the securities were sold in
February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
