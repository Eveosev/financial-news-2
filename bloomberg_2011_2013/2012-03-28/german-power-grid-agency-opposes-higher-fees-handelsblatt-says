Germany ’s Federal Network Agency
won’t allow power grid operators to raise fees for using their
infrastructure, Handelsblatt reported, citing Jochen Homann,
president of the regulator known as the Bundesnetzagentur.  While the agency won’t ditch its focus on cost efficiency,
it is ready to discuss regulation with energy companies to help
the country exit nuclear power, the newspaper cited Homann as
saying in an e-mailed summary of an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
