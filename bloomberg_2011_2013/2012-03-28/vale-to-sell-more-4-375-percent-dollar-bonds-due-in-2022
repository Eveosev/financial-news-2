Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, sold $1.25 billion more of its 4.375 percent
dollar bonds that mature in 2022, according to a person familiar
with the transaction.  Vale sold the debt today to yield 200 basis points, or 2
percentage points, above U.S. Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds from the issuance will be used for “general
corporate purposes,” the company said today in a statement.
Vale,  Brazil ’s largest exporter, is spending $21.4 billion this
year in existing operations and new projects amid environmental
licensing delays, labor shortages and cost pressures. The
company invested a record $18 billion excluding acquisitions in
2011, less than its initial $24 billion spending plan.  Vale sold $1 billion of the bonds on Jan. 4 to yield 4.525
percent. Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG
arranged today’s sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
