The lira strengthened to the
highest level in almost three weeks after the central bank
withheld funding at its benchmark rate for a fifth day.  The Turkish currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 1.7839 per
dollar at 5:55 p.m. in Istanbul, its highest level since March
8. The lira has gained 1.4 percent since March 22, when the
central bank first declined to offer daily funding at its
benchmark one-week repo rate of 5.75 percent, the lower end of
its so-called rates corridor.  “The central bank is now focusing squarely” on the value
of the lira, Tim Ash, chief emerging-markets economist at Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said in an e-mailed note to clients
today. “Whatever the central bank might say about its
commitment to fighting inflation, we know that it’s reaction
function is far more responsive now to the movement in the
lira.”  The bank kept its interest-rate corridor, which ranges from
a low of 5.75 percent to a high of 11.5 percent, unchanged at
its monthly meeting yesterday after a 1 percentage point
reduction in the top rate on Feb. 21 caused the lira to weaken.
From this day of rate trimming to the point when the bank
restarted liquidity tightening on March 22, the lira depreciated
3.1 percent.  The currency has gained 6 percent against the dollar this
year, following a decline of 18 percent last year.  Turkey ’s
current-account gap is the highest in the world at 10.3 percent
of the gross domestic product among 60 major economies tracked
by the  International Monetary Fund . The inflation rate fell to
10.4 percent in February from 10.6 percent in the previous
month, while remaining at more than twice the bank’s 5 percent
target for the year.  Yields on benchmark two-year Turkish  bonds  fell 1 basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
