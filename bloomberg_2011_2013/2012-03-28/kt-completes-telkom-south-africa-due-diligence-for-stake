KT Corp. (030200) ,  South Korea ’s largest
phone and Internet company, completed due diligence on  Telkom
South Africa Ltd. (TKG)  last week ahead of a planned stake purchase.  A study that lasted more than two months ended March 23,
Seongnam, South Korea-based KT said in an e-mailed response to
queries. KT is reviewing a plan to offer Telkom a so-called
“managed service,” an outsourcing arrangement under which KT
would manage some of the Pretoria-based carrier’s services,
according to the e-mail.  KT said in October it plans to acquire about 20 percent of
Telkom by buying new shares for 36.06 rand apiece, in a deal
valued at about 3.8 billion rand ($500 million). KT is looking
for investment opportunities, with a focus on  emerging markets 
such as central America and Africa, after agreeing to sell its
80 percent stake in Russian carrier New Telephone Co., the
company said in May.  Negotiations to buy a stake in Telkom are “going well,”
KT Chairman Lee Suk Chae said on March 7.  To contact the reporters on this story:
