The U.S. House Ways and Means
Committee approved a $46 billion small-business tax break on a
21-14 party-line vote, as Republicans eager to aid companies’
cash flow overcame Democratic objections.  Under the bill, companies with fewer than 500 workers in
either 2010 or 2011 would be eligible to deduct 20 percent of
their profits in 2012. Such a broad  tax cut  with few limits
would give small companies money to reinvest in their
businesses, said Representative  Dave Camp , the committee
chairman, as the panel considered the bill today.  “These business owners are real experts who know what they
need to add jobs back to our communities,” said Camp, a
 Michigan  Republican.  The committee’s approval sends the bill to the full House
for a vote expected by the April 17 filing deadline for
individual U.S. taxpayers, drawing attention to the measure at a
time when Americans are most interested in taxes.  Democrats on the panel criticized the bill for not tying
the tax break to hiring or investment, and their objections
signaled that the measure may not fare well in the Democratic-
controlled Senate as currently written.  “This is another bonanza for the very wealthy,” said
Representative  Sander Levin  of Michigan, the committee’s top
Democrat. “It is not targeted. It is essentially not for the
typical small business person.”  Nonpartisan Analysis  Levin cited an analysis from the nonpartisan  Tax Policy
Center  showing that 49 percent of the benefit would go to
households with incomes exceeding $1 million.  The proposal contains limits, including a cap on the
deduction of 50 percent of wages paid to employees who aren’t
owners. Certain types of passive income, such as royalties and
rents, couldn’t be counted as eligible income for calculating
the tax break.  The bill, sponsored by House Majority Leader  Eric Cantor , a
Virginia Republican, would apply for this year only. The measure
includes no offsetting spending cuts or tax increases.  Democrats noted changes from previous versions of the bill.
Republicans removed a list of industries that had been deemed
ineligible, including pornography producers, professional sports
franchises, hotel owners and golf courses. The bill lets
partnerships count profit distributions to partners with stakes
of less than 10 percent as wages for the purpose of the 50
percent cap.  ‘Big Tax Advantage’  “We’re really giving a big tax advantage to lawyers,
lobbyists, accountants and hedge-fund managers,” said
Representative Pete Stark, a California Democrat.  Democrats pointed out that sole proprietors who don’t pay
wages to non-owners wouldn’t be eligible.  With the annual tax-filing deadline approaching,  Senate
Democrats  have proposed their own small-business tax break.  That bill would revive for 2012 the ability of companies to
write off 100 percent of capital investments. It also would
provide a 10 percent income credit, capped at $500,000 per
company, for employers that expand their payrolls.  Camp said he supports the capital investment write-off and
suggested that the provision might be an avenue for compromise
in negotiations between the House and Senate.  The House bill is HR 9. The Senate bill is S 2237.  To contact the reporter on this story:
