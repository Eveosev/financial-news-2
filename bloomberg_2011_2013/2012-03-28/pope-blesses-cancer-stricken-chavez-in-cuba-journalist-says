Pope Benedict XVI  gave  Hugo Chavez 
his blessing for a quick recovery in a private meeting in Cuba
requested by the cancer-stricken Venezuelan leader, according to
an opposition journalist.  Cuban President  Raul Castro  and his brother, Fidel Castro,
were present at the 5-minute meeting yesterday in Havana, Nelson
Bocaranda, who frequently breaks news on the president’s health
in the absence of details from the government, wrote on his
 blog . The pope gave Chavez a rosary that he blessed, Bocaranda
reported without saying how he obtained the information.  Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi, in a phone interview,
denied any meeting took place. Phone calls to the Venezuelan
Information Ministry seeking comment went unanswered.  The alleged meeting, which Bocaranda first reported was in
the works on March 25, was arranged by Venezuelan diplomats who
used to work at the South American nation’s mission to the
Vatican, the journalist said. All participants agreed the brief
meeting would be without media coverage, Bocaranda said.  Chavez has until now downplayed the possibility of a
meeting after he traveled to Cuba ahead of the pope’s arrival to
undergo radiation therapy for an undisclosed type of cancer.  Chavez, speaking on Venezuelan state television yesterday
from  Havana , said he didn’t want to “interfere” with the first
papal visit to Cuba since 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
