Mexico ’s peso fell after durable
goods orders in the U.S., the biggest buyer of the Latin
American country’s exports, rose less than forecast last month.  The peso slid 0.7 percent to 12.7942 per  U.S. dollar  at
8:57 a.m. in Mexico City, from 12.7025 yesterday. The currency
has gained 8.9 percent this year, the most among major
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Demand for the peso weakened after the Commerce Department
said today in  Washington  that U.S. bookings for goods meant to
last at least three years climbed 2.2 percent in February after
a revised 3.6 percent decline the prior month. Economists
forecast a 3 percent gain in February, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  “The market was a bit too optimistic,”  Pedro Tuesta , a
Washington-based Latin America economist at 4Cast Inc, said by
phone. “The export rebound may not last if durable goods
continue to be weaker than expected.”  Mexican exports will probably climb from last year’s record
high as demand from the U.S. increases, adding to dollar
inflows, Mexican Finance Minister Jose Antonio Meade said in an
interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York earlier this
month.  The yield on peso-denominated debt due in 2024 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 6.45 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.11
centavo to 130.67 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
