France will need to almost triple
investment in renewable energy if the nation’s oldest nuclear
reactors are phased out, said Manon Dufour, an analyst in  London 
at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande , whose lead over
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  has narrowed in the polls, has
committed to closing French reactors after 40 years of service.  “An additional 102 billion euros ($136 billion) would need
to be invested in renewable capacity in replacement,” Dufour
said in a report published today. BNEF’s baseline forecast for
French renewable investment is 60 billion euros.  France gets more of its power from nuclear plants than any
other country. A third of the nation’s 58-reactor fleet has been
operating for more than 30 years and would close in the next
decade if their operations were capped at 40 years, BNEF said.
That would wipe out 26 gigawatts by 2025 and 46 gigawatts by
2030, it said in the report.  Electricite de  France  SA operates 95 percent of French
electricity generation and closing aging nuclear reactors would
reduce this market share to 59 percent by 2025, BNEF said.  Hollande wants to reduce France’s dependence on nuclear to
50 percent of power production from about 75 percent, and has
committed to close the Fessenheim atomic plant, EDF’s oldest,
within five years if he’s elected. The presidential elections
will be held on May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
