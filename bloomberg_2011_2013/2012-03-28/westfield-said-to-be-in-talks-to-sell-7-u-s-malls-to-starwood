Westfield Group (WDC)  is in talks to sell
majority stakes in seven of its U.S. shopping centers for about
$1 billion to Barry Sternlicht’s Starwood Capital Group LLC,
according to a person with knowledge of the discussions, who
asked not to be identified as the matter is private.  Five of the malls are among the 17 centers Westfield has
been seeking to dispose of since last year, according to the
Wall Street Journal, which earlier reported the sale talks
without naming a source. Sydney-based Westfield will retain a
minority holding in the malls that Greenwich, Connecticut-based
Starwood acquires, the newspaper said.  Julia Clarke, Sydney-based spokeswoman for Westfield,
couldn’t immediately comment.  Tom Johnson , an external spokesman
for  Starwood Capital  in  New York , declined to comment on the
report.  Westfield, which spun off ownership of half its Australian
and New Zealand malls in November 2010, is freeing up capital to
invest in higher-return activities such as development projects
in Italy and New York’s World Trade Center. In February, it
announced a joint venture with the Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board, which will pay $1.8 billion for a 45 percent
share of 10 U.S. malls and two redevelopment sites.  Westfield  shares  rose 1.9 percent to A$9 as of 12:16 p.m.
in Sydney.  To contact the reporters on this story:
