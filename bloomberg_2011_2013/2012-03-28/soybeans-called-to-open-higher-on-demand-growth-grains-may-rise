What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
on the Chicago Board of Trade on speculation that smaller crops
in  South America  will force Chinese importers to buy more from
the U.S., Chad Henderson, a market analyst for Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in
a telephone interview. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
steady to 0.1 cent higher a pound, and soybean-meal futures may
open steady to $1 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures may open 2 cents to 4 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  on speculation that dry weather in the U.S. Great
Plains,  Europe  and  Canada  may threaten yield potential, reducing
global inventories, Henderson said.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher in  Chicago  on signs of tightening supplies, as U.S.
farmers withheld sales after average cash prices dropped
yesterday to the lowest in at least five weeks, Henderson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
