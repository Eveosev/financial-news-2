Produce Buying Co. purchased
274,000 metric tons of cocoa in the 23-week period to March 22,
said the Accra, Ghana-based company, the country’s biggest buyer
of beans from farmers.  The purchases represented about 36 percent of the national
figure, Kojo Atta-Krah, the company’s managing director, said
today in an interview in the capital, Accra.  Weekly purchases “are still low, we’ve consistently been
buying around a thousand tons in the last three weeks,” he
said. “Things are changing on the field so we know volumes will
improve from April.”  Ghana is the second-biggest cocoa producer after
neighboring  Ivory Coast . The country’s 33-week main crop
marketing season began Oct. 14.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
