The  International Monetary Fund 
says Hungary’s government is aware of conditions for starting
bailout negotiations and must make the next move,  Vilaggazdasag 
reported, citing Iryna Ivaschenko, the IMF’s country
representative.  Ivaschenko’s comments at a university event in Budapest
yesterday contrasted with statements from the government saying
the Washington-based lender still needs to clarify what Hungary
must to do to start talks, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
