The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment rose,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 3 basis points to 150.5 basis
points as of 8:28 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland Plc
prices show. The gauge is set for its biggest daily rise since
March 22, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index increased 2.5 basis
points to 142 as of 11:27 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) 
prices show. The measure is poised for the highest close since
March 23, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The  Markit iTraxx Japan  index rose 1 basis point to 149
basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
