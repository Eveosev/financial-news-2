Algeria agreed to pay $6.5 billion
to buy the controlling stake in Djezzy, VimpelCom Ltd.’s
Algerian mobile phone unit, Reuters reported today, citing an
unidentified finance ministry official in the North African
Nation.  Algeria would get 51 percent of the unit, Reuters reported.  An advisor to the Algerian Finance Minister said he had no
information about the deal, when contacted by Bloomberg for
comment. Orascom Telecom’s press office said it didn’t have any
information and a call and text message to Naguib Sawiris,
Orascom’s founder, were not immediately answered. VimpelCom’s
director of communications, Bobby Leach, declined to comment in
an e-mail.  Algeria and  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , in which VimpelCom
holds a majority stake, have been disputing Djezzy’s ownership
for over a year.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
