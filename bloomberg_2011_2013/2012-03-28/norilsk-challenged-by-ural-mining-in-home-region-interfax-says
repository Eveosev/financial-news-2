OAO Norilsk Nickel,  Russia ’s
largest mining company, is competing for a license in the Taimyr
region, where it was founded, with billionaire Iskandar
Makhmudov’s Ural Mining & Metallurgical Co., Interfax said.  The company, also known as UMMC, will bid against Norilsk
for the southern part of the Norilsky-1 copper and nickel field,
the Moscow-based newswire reported. The initial payment is set
at 4.4 billion rubles ($151 million) and the tender results will
be announced June 5, according to Interfax. UMMC overtook
Norilsk as Russia’s largest copper producer last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
