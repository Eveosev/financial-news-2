Lean, finely textured beef is safe
to eat, even after some food companies have cut back or halted
use of the product, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said.  “This product is safe,” Vilsack said today during a press
conference in  Des Moines ,  Iowa , that was broadcast on the state
government website. “There’s no question about it. We have said
that repeatedly. This product is safe. This product contains
less fat, and this product historically is less expensive.”  The product is made of beef trim and is treated with
ammonium hydroxide to kill pathogens.  To contact the reporter on this story:
