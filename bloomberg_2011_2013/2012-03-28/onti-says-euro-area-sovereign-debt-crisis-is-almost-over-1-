Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said the euro area crisis is “almost over” and that his nation
has helped to stop a worsening of the situation.  Europe  had initially been slow to respond, Monti said in a
speech in  Tokyo  today.  Greece  must step up efforts to tighten its budget and
overhaul the nation’s economy to prevent a second bailout from
collapsing, European officials said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
