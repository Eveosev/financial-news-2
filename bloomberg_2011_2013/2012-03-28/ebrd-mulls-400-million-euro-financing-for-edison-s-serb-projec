The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development may arrange financing of as much
as 400 million euros ($532 million) to support  Edison SpA (EDN) ’s
Serbian venture for developing a 750-megawatt power plant.  The loan may be arranged together with commercial lenders,
supporting the joint project of Edison and  Elektroprivreda
Srbije  Srbija, Serbia’s power monopoly, for building the
Kolubara B coal-fired plant 40 kilometers (24.8 miles) southwest
of Belgrade.  The cost of the whole project is to be determined, the bank
said. Serbia’s state-owned utility had estimated it may take 1
billion euros to complete the facility, whose construction began
in 1988.  Completing Kolubara B would be “the first significant
private-sector investment” in power production in Serbia, which
also needs to replace “a number of obsolete power generation
units” and cut  carbon emissions  from its lignite-fired plants
to meet European Union environmental standards, the bank said.  Serbia , which became a candidate for EU membership on March
1, wants to comply with EU environmental standards by 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
