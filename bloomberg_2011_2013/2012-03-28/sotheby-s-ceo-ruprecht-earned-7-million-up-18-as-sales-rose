Sotheby’s (BID)  Chief Executive Officer
William F. Ruprecht earned $7 million in 2011, up 18 percent
from a year earlier, as the New York auction house reported the
second-most-profitable year in its history.  Ruprecht received a salary of $700,000, stock awards valued
at $4.2 million, “incentive compensation” of $1.9 million and
other compensation -- including automobile allowance, club dues
and personal financial-planning fees -- of $230,056 according to
a filing today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  “Mr. Ruprecht was responsible for securing a number of the
company’s most high-value and successful auction and private
sales consignments,” Sotheby’s said in the filing.  The auctioneer had profit of $171.4 million last year,
second only to 2007, when it earned $213.1 million.  Its shares fell 37 percent last year, and dropped 57 cents
today to $39.94 in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading.
The shares are below their peak of $57.64 reached on Oct. 10,
2007.  To contact the reporter on the story:
