Ghana ’s producer-price inflation
accelerated in February as costs of mining in  Africa ’s second-
biggest gold producer jumped, according to the Ghana Statistical
Service.  The rate rose to 16.1 percent from a revised 15 percent a
month earlier, Philomena Nyarko, an official with the service,
told reporters in Accra, the capital, today. Costs rose 2.1
percent in the month, she said.  Mining and quarrying costs increased 39 percent in February
from a revised rate of 28 percent a month earlier, as global
 gold prices , which are factored into producers’ costs in the
index, climbed, Nyarko said. The price for spot gold was an
average $1,740.55 per ounce in February, compared with $1,377.89
in the same month of 2011.  Growth in manufacturing costs slowed to 13.7 percent in the
month from a revised 14.3 percent in January, while utilities
costs were little changed at 9.4 percent, compared with 9.3
percent a month earlier, according to the statistics agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
