Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the best
performer on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  this year, is
still not yet fairly valued, said Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan .  The firm’s shares were pressured by new regulations, low
interest rates and concern about the global economy and U.S.
mortgage expenses, Moynihan said in an annual letter to
investors released today and dated March 12. The shares closed
at $7.99 that day in New York, and  rallied  to $9.60 at
yesterday’s close, up more than 70 percent since Dec. 31.  “Our stock price does not yet reflect the work we are
doing to strengthen capital, reduce risk and attract more
business from our customers,” Moynihan said in the letter. The
firm made progress last year improving  profitability  and “with
the economy slowly but steadily improving, we believe this trend
should continue in 2012.”  Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, rebounded
from a 58 percent decline in New York trading in 2011 after
signs of economic improvement this year. More than $33 billion
in asset sales helped the Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm
boost capital levels, and its shares extended their rally this
month after the firm passed the Federal Reserve stress tests.  Moynihan announced a plan last year to eliminate at least
30,000 jobs, part of his Project New BAC efficiency effort. The
first phase of the plan, meant to trim $5 billion in costs, is
being implemented now and the second phase will conclude in
April, the CEO said in his letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
