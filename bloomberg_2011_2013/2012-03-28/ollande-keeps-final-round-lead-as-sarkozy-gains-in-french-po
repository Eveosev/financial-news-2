Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande  maintained his lead over President  Nicolas Sarkozy  for
the decisive run-off of the French presidential election, while
losing ground for the first round, a poll showed today.  The survey, conducted by TNS-Sofres/Sopra Group for I-Tele
cable channel, shows Hollande would win a head-to-head race in
the May 6 second round by 55 percent to 45 percent for Sarkozy.
The gap narrowed from the 58-42 measured in the previous poll
March 12.  Sarkozy gained over Hollande in the first-round survey,
leading 29 percent against 28 percent for Hollande. Sarkozy
gained 3 percentage points and Hollande lost two from March 12,
TNS said.  Anti-immigrant campaigner Marine Le Pen was third at 15
percent, down one percentage point. Anti-capitalist candidate
Jean-Luc Melanchon gained most, up 3.5 points to 13.5 percent.  Under the French system, the top two vote getters go into a
run-off vote.  The survey was carried out March 26-27 among a sample of
1,000 people aged 18 and older and registered to vote. The
pollster did not publish margins of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
