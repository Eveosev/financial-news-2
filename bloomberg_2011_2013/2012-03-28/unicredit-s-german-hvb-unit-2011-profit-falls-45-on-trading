HVB Group (HVM) ,  UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s German
banking unit, said profit declined 45 percent last year because
of a lower trading result.  Net income decreased to 931 million euros ($1.24 billion)
from 1.7 billion euros a year earlier, the Munich-based lender
said in an e-mailed  statement  today. The trading result fell 75
percent to 190 million euros while loan-loss provisions were
reduced to 266 million euros from 632 million euros.  HVB, led by Chief Executive Officer Theodor Weimer,
announced plans last year to eliminate more jobs to reduce
administrative costs. Milan-based UniCredit,  Italy ’s biggest
bank, said yesterday that fourth-quarter profit dropped 65
percent, a smaller decline than analysts estimated, as it earned
less from lending and wrote down Greek bonds.  The decline in the trading result reflects “the effects of
the high market volatility in the third and fourth quarters and
the resulting restraint on the part of customers in trading
activities,” HVB said in the statement.  The lender’s cost-income ratio worsened to 62 percent last
year from 52 percent in 2010, a trend Weimer said breaches a
desired measure below 60 percent. Administrative costs increased
by 5.2 percent to 3.6 billion euros, “partly on account of the
bank levies charged in  Austria  and the U.K.,” HVB said.  Bank Levy  HVB paid a 101 million-euro bank levy in  Germany , 48
million euros in Austria and 19 million euros in the U.K.,
Weimer said. “That makes us the second-biggest payer of the
bank levy in Germany,” he added.  The core Tier 1 capital ratio in accordance with Basel II
rules declined to 15.6 percent from 15.9 percent in the course
of 2011.  UniCredit CEO Federico Ghizzoni is cutting costs, reducing
staff and reviewing the bank’s strategy in central and eastern
 Europe  as part of a plan approved in November to boost
profitability. The lender raised 7.5 billion euros in a rights
offer in January to meet capital targets set by the European
Banking Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
