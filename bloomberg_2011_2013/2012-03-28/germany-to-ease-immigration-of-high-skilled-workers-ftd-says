Germany ’s coalition parties agreed
to lower the legal wage threshold for high-skilled immigrant
workers in a bid to fill specialized job gaps in the labor
market,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing lawmakers
it didn’t identify.  The threshold will be reduced from an annual income of
66,000 euros ($87,952) to 44,800 euros in general and 34,200
euros for jobs with high vacancies such as engineers, computer
scientists or physicians, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
