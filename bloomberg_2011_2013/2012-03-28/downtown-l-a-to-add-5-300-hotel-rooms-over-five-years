About 5,300 hotel rooms are likely
to be added in downtown  Los Angeles  over five years, helped by
such developments as the $172 million construction of  Marriott
International Inc. (MAR) ’s Courtyard and Residence Inn property.  Marriott, based in Bethesda,  Maryland , will operate the 23-
story building across the street from its existing JW Marriott
and Ritz-Carlton hotels. The new property will house an upscale
174-room Courtyard and a 218-room Residence Inn for travelers
staying longer. Los Angeles has about 1,700 hotel rooms within a
half mile (0.8 kilometer) of the city’s convention center, said
Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment Group.  “I predict in the next five years, we’ll have 7,000 rooms
down here,” Leiweke said today at a news conference about the
two Marriott properties, scheduled to open in mid-2014.
Anschutz’s L.A. Live entertainment complex is home to the JW
Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels.  The Courtyard and Residence Inn hotels will be financed
with money from foreigners who can obtain permanent U.S.
residency with so-called EB-5 visas, in exchange for investing a
minimum of $500,000 and creating at least 10 long-term jobs. The
project is being built by a partnership of investment company
American Life Inc., based in  Seattle , and developer
Williams/Dame & Associates of Portland,  Oregon .  Mayor  Antonio Villaraigosa , who also spoke at the event,
said that “the JW Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton are the anchors
in this area and will be attracting a lot more development, such
as these two new Marriott properties we’re celebrating today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
