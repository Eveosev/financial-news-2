YPF SA (YPFD) ,  Argentina ’s largest energy
company, denied a report by newspaper La Nacion that it
increased fuel prices by as much as 12 percent this year.  Most of YPF’s more than 1,500 gas stations haven’t
increased fuel prices, apart from diesel, since August,
according to a company official who declined to be named because
of corporate policy.  Some stations increased prices to reduce the price
difference with the competition, the official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
