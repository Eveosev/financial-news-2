Leighton Holdings Ltd. (LEI) ,  Australia ’s
largest construction company, slumped by the most in almost a
year after cutting its 2012 profit forecast, citing increased
costs due to wet weather and lower-than-expected productivity.  Leighton’s  shares  plunged 6.7 percent to A$22.16 at the
4:10 p.m. close of trading in Sydney, the biggest drop since
April 14, and the second-largest decline on the benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index.  The Sydney-based company’s underlying profit in the year
ending Dec. 31 will be between A$400 million ($416 million) and
A$450 million, it said in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange today. The forecast is down from the A$600 million to
A$650 million range the Sydney-based company provided in
January.  The cuts are due to “very frustrating” issues with
Leighton’s Brisbane Airport Link and a Victorian desalination
project, the company’s Chief Executive Officer Hamish Tyrwhitt
said in the statement.  “Wet weather in Brisbane, productivity below expectations
at both sites combined with the complexity of the commissioning
of the integrated systems at Airport Link have seen an
unanticipated increase in forecast costs,” Tyrwhitt said.  Leighton’s German parent  Hochtief AG (HOT)  also cut its net
income forecast to just under 180 million euros ($240 million)
in the year ending Dec. 31, from a previous expectation for net
income of close to 288 million euros.  Airport Link  The company reiterated its expectations for new orders,
order backlog and sales in a statement. Hochtief shares fell 3.2
percent to 48.655 euros at the close of trading in  Frankfurt 
yesterday.  Leighton’s net income after tax excluding  capital gains  and
impairments will be A$100 million to A$150 million in the six
months ending June 30, it said. Airport Link will see a
deterioration of A$148 million before tax, and the desalination
project A$106 million, according to the statement.  Leighton last month reported a profit of A$340 million for
the six months ended Dec. 31. Hochtief, controlled by ACS
Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA, had a loss of 160
million euros in 2011 and canceled its dividend, partly due to
additional charges at Leighton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
