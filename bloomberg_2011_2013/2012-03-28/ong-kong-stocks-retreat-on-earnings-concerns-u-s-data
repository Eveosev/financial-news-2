Hong Kong  stocks  dropped, with a
gauge of mainland shares falling for a 10th time in 11 days, as
Jiangxi Copper Co. and Gome Electrical Appliances Holding Ltd.
missed profit estimates and Societe Generale SA said earnings at
Chinese companies listed in the city won’t grow this year.  Jiangxi Copper,  China ’s biggest producer of the metal,
dropped 2.4 percent after second-half profit missed analysts’
estimates. Gome Electrical tumbled 21 percent after earnings
fell at the nation’s second-largest electronics retailer.  Li &
Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of clothes and toys to Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., slid 5.2 percent on a plan to sell shares at a discount.  “We’re seeing a modest correction following recent
gains,” said  Yoji Takeda , who oversees about $1.1 billion at
RBC Investment Management ( Asia ) Ltd. in Hong Kong. “We’ve seen
some negative earnings, but overall the economy is still growing
at a healthy speed, so I’m not too worried.”  The Hang Seng Index declined 0.8 percent to 20,885.42 at
the 4 p.m. close in  Hong Kong . The gauge climbed to its highest
level since March 19 yesterday after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said the U.S. recovery isn’t assured and
signaled he will continue to stimulate the economy. Volume on
the index today was about 6.4 percent lower than the 30-day
moving average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of mainland companies
dropped 1 percent to 10,701.37. Societe Generale said firms on
the gauge wouldn’t be able to increase profits this year,
cutting a previous forecast for 5 percent growth.  ‘Surprisingly Weak’  “Consensus earnings expectations for the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index for 2012 are far too optimistic,”  Societe
Generale  strategists Guy Stear and Anthony Lee wrote in report
dated yesterday.  Profit at Chinese industrial companies dropped 5.2 percent
in January and February, the first decline since 2009, the
National Bureau of Statistics said on its website yesterday.
Earnings rose 34 percent in the first two months of last year.  Jiangxi Copper fell 2.4 percent to HK$18.30 today. Profit
fell to 2.27 billion yuan ($360 million) in the six months ended
Dec. 31, compared with 2.79 billion yuan a year earlier,
according to Bloomberg calculations based on full-year earnings
announced yesterday. The result trailed the 3.04 billion yuan
median estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Angang Steel Co. slid 2.2 percent to HK$4.88 after the
biggest Hong Kong-traded steelmaker reported a wider second-half
loss because of waning demand and high raw-material costs.  Earnings Performance  Of the 239 companies that reported annual net income on the
Hang Seng Composite Index since Jan. 9, 52 percent missed
analysts’ estimates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gome Electrical slumped 21 percent to HK$1.64, the biggest
decline since September 30. Net income at the company dropped 6
percent to 1.84 billion yuan last year, missing the 2.42 billion
yuan mean estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Samsonite International SA slipped 1.1 percent to HK$13.96
after the world’s largest branded-luggage maker forecast slower
sales growth in Asia this year.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  were little
changed today. The gauge dropped 0.3 percent in  New York 
yesterday even as a key index of U.S. consumer confidence held
close to the highest level in a year, and a measure of property
values in 20 cities fell at a slower pace in January.  Bernanke ‘Cautious’  “The recent news has been good,” Bernanke said, according
to a transcript of an interview with ABC News anchor Diane
Sawyer provided by the network. “But I think we need to be
cautious and make sure this is sustainable. And -- we haven’t
quite yet got to the point where we can be completely confident
that we’re on a track to full recovery.”  Exporters dropped.  Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , a power-tool
maker that counts  North America  as its largest market, declined
3.9 percent to HK$10.32. Li & Fung, which gets 65 percent of
sales from the U.S., slipped 5.2 percent to HK$18.58.  Shares also fell after the Wal-Mart supplier said it plans
to sell 210 million shares at a 5 percent discount to
yesterday’s closing price. Li & Fung said it plans to raise
HK$3.9 billion ($502 million) in its biggest stock sale since
its initial public offering in 1992 to help fund acquisitions.  The Hang Seng Index climbed about 14 percent this year
through yesterday as signs the  U.S. economy  is recovering fueled
confidence in the outlook for exports. The rally boosted the
value of  stocks  on the gauge to 10.6 times  estimated earnings .
That compares with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times for
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  expiring this month fell 1.2
percent to 20,902. The HSI Volatility Index was little changed
at 18.87, indicating options traders expect a swing of about 5.4
percent in the benchmark index over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
