Italian business confidence in
March rose from the lowest level in more than two years after
the government adopted measures to overhaul the labor market and
make it easier for companies to shed workers during economic
downturns.  The manufacturing-sentiment  index  rose to 92.1 from a
revised 91.7 in February, Rome-based national statistics
institute Istat said today. Economists had predicted a reading
of 91.5, according to the median of 15 estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Prime Minister Mario Monti’s government passed its labor
market reform this month, defying union opposition in easing
firing rules as part of his economic overhaul began in December.
The government is implementing 20 billion euros ($27 billion) of
austerity measures aimed at balancing the budget next year and
has also passed laws to open up closed professions and ease
bureaucracy.  Europe ’s fourth-biggest economy slipped into recession in
the first quarter and the European Commission forecasts that
Italy will contract 1.3 percent this year. Consumer demand is
being hurt by the tax increases and higher gasoline prices
caused by the austerity plan and the government may boost value
added tax another 2 percentage points later this year.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  today said today that the
region’s debt crisis is “almost over,” paving the way for an
economic recovery.  Istat originally reported a February confidence reading of 
91.5.   To contact the reporter on this story:
