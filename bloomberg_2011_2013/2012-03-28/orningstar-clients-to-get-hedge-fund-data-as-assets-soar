Morningstar Inc. (MORN)  will partner with
Hedge Fund Research Inc. to provide investment information to
institutional clients in an industry where assets have surpassed
$2 trillion.  Morningstar, which is based in  Chicago  and provides data on
about 375,000 investment offerings, will offer hedge fund data
to 1,700 institutional customers that use Morningstar Direct
globally, according to a statement today from Hedge Fund
Research, also based in Chicago. Hedge Fund Research produces
the HFRX and HFRI hedge fund indexes as well as a database of
fund performance and assets, according to the statement.  Morningstar is expanding its offerings as investors seek
assets outside traditional stocks and bonds.  Hedge funds 
attracted $70 billion in 2011, bringing assets to a record $2.02
trillion, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.  “Our clients have requested additional alternative
investment content,” Chris Boruff, president of Morningstar’s
software unit, said in the statement. “Teaming up with HFR
complements our efforts to make Direct a comprehensive platform
for institutional investors and asset managers.”  Institutions will have the option to get access to Hedge
Fund Research’s data if they have the appropriate licenses,
Joanna McGinley, vice president of core institutional software
for Morningstar, said in a telephone interview. Hedge Fund
Research’s indexes will be available for Morningstar subscribers
at the beginning of April, McGinley said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
