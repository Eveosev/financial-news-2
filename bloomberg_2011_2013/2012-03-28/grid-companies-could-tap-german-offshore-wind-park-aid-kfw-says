Power grid companies seeking to
connect planned wind parks off the German coast to the mainland
may be able to tap an existing 5 billion-euro ($6.68 billion)
financing facility in future, KfW Group said.  The German state-owned development lender is considering
how it can support the country’s expansion of renewable energy
generation,  Ulrich Schroeder , KfW’s chief executive officer,
said today at a press conference in  Frankfurt .  KfW has “room for maneuver” because only 500 million
euros to 600 million euros of the aid has been granted, he said.
The lender hasn’t discussed the steps that would need to be
taken to increase the overall size of the facility with the
German government, according to the CEO.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
