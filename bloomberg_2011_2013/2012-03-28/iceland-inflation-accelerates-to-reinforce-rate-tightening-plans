Iceland’s annual inflation rate
accelerated this month, reinforcing the central bank’s plan to
increase  interest rates  after the krona weakened.  Inflation was 6.4 percent in March, compared with 6.3
percent in the prior month, Reykjavik-based Statistics Iceland
said today in a statement on its website. Consumer prices rose 1
percent on the month, the office said.  The  central bank  this month raised its benchmark rate by a
quarter of a percentage point to 5 percent as it seeks to steer
Iceland’s recovery and ensure a stable krona as capital controls
are unwound. The bank anticipates further increases “in the
near term,” it said in a March 21 statement.  The bank closed some loopholes for bondholders in its
capital controls on March 13, which had threatened to weaken the
currency. Sedlabanki, which targets annual price growth of 2.5
percent, last month raised its forecast for economic growth in
2012 to 2.5 percent from 2.3 percent previously.  The tightening of controls “reduces inflation and the
inflationary expectations for the short term,” Hogni Haraldsson,
an economist with IFS Consulting ehf, said in a note prior to
today’s inflation data “For the long term, the markets’ hopes
for  capital controls ’ abolishment and appreciation in the
currency have dwindled, which will lead to higher inflation in
the future.”  The central bank expects inflation to slow to 4.6 percent
this year and to 3.2 percent by the end of 2013 and 2.6 percent
by the end of 2014, it said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
