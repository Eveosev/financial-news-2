The U.S. wants to help  Europe  in
its quest for  energy security  and diversifying its supply, a
U.S. State Department official said.  “The U.S. has an interest in an economically strong
Europe,” Richard Morningstar, U.S. special envoy for Eurasian
energy issues, said at a conference in Athens today. “Energy
security is a major factor for the economy of any country.”  The administration of U.S. President  Barack Obama 
“strongly supports” the “southern corridor” pipeline project
to bring Caspian gas to Europe via Turkey, he said. “Our aim is
to encourage a balanced and diverse energy strategy with
multiple energy sources.”  While the U.S. has repeatedly said it recognizes Cyprus’s
right to drill in its offshore zones, and supports bids by U.S.
companies to work in the region, any future revenue from oil and
natural gas in Cyprus should be shared equally between the Greek
Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities, he added.  “The discovery of natural gas in the eastern Mediterranean
is a good thing as it created diversification for Europe and
will help countries in the eastern Mediterranean in terms of
their own domestic needs,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
