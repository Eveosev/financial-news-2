The head of  Egypt ’s ruling military
council pardoned Ayman Nour, opening the door for the politician
imprisoned under  Hosni Mubarak  to contest presidential
elections.  Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi pardoned Nour from
“all the consequences” of his 2005 conviction, the state-run
Middle East News Agency said. The decision allows Nour “to
exercise all his political rights,” it said.  Nour, who challenged Mubarak in 2005 elections, was
imprisoned on fraud charges that the New York-based monitoring
group  Human Rights Watch  has described as “trumped up.” He was
released on health grounds in 2009.  He has previously expressed interest in running in the
presidential vote scheduled for May, though it remains unclear
if he will actually contest the race. Presidential candidates
have until April 8 to register.  To contact the reporters on this story:
