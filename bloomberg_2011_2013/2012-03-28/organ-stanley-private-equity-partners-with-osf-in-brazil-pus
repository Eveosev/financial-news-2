Morgan Stanley’s (MS)  private-equity
business formed a partnership with Sao Paulo-based OSF Merchant
Banking to seek investments in Brazil, the world’s second-
biggest developing economy after China.  Morgan Stanley Global Private Equity, which has invested $8
billion since 1985, will work with OSF to find growth companies
with “sustainable” operating margins, the firms said today in
a joint statement, without mentioning if they were targeting
specific industries.  “Brazil has entered a cycle of abundant opportunity and
unprecedented capital flow,” Hans Apostel, head of OSF’s
investment committee, said in the statement. “Private equity
firms are now presented with the challenge of identifying and
structuring investments in a very competitive environment that
does not typically rely on leverage as a fundamental piece in
transaction finance.”  Morgan Stanley Private Equity, based in  New York , in
January recruited Jesus Reyes Heroles, the former chief
executive officer of Mexico’s state oil company,  Petroleos
Mexicanos , “to build a leading regional energy company.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
