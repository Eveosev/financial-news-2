The ruble dropped the most this
year as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, declined.  The Russian currency lost 1.3 percent to 29.3925 per dollar
at the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest decline since Dec.
29. The ruble was 1 percent weaker at 39.0675 per euro and lost
1.1 percent to 33.7463 against the central bank’s target dollar-
euro basket.  Brent crude  dropped 1.3 percent to $123.90 per barrel after
a government report showed U.S. inventories climbed the most in
20 months last week, signalling weaker oil demand from the
world’s largest economy. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said yesterday that economic recovery in the U.S. isn’t
assured.  Bank Rossii manages the ruble within a so-called “floating
corridor” against a basket of dollars and euros to limit swings
that erode exporters’ competitiveness. The current level against
the basket implies the bank may be buying about $250 million a
day in other currencies against the ruble, Sergey Fishgoyt,
deputy head of foreign exchange at Otkritie Bank in Moscow, said
by e-mail March 26.  Russia’s $3.5 billion of Eurobonds due July 2018 rose,
lowering the yield five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point,
to 3.798 percent. Russia is selling $7 billion of five-, 10- and
30-year Eurobonds in the biggest emerging-market sovereign issue
since at least 2009, a banker with knowledge of the deal said on
condition of anonymity.  More Value  The new five-year notes offer more value than U.S.
Treasuries of the same maturity,  Bill Gross , who runs the
world’s biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co.,
told CNBC yesterday.  The yield on Russia’s dollar bonds due in 2015 dropped 12
basis points to 2.274 percent. Eurobonds due the same year
issued by OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, yielded seven
basis points less than yesterday at 3.615 percent, while the
yield on similar-maturity dollar debt from state gas monopoly
OAO Gazprom declined five basis points to 3.392 percent.  Investors increased bets on the ruble weakening, with non-
deliverable forwards showing the Russian currency at 29.7378 per
dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 29.3966
per dollar yesterday.  The ruble has appreciated 9 percent against the dollar this
year, heading for its best quarter since Bloomberg began
compiling the data in 2003.  Brazil ’s real strengthened 2.4
percent over the same period,  India ’s rupee gained 4.3 percent
and  China ’s yuan rose less than 0.1 percent, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
