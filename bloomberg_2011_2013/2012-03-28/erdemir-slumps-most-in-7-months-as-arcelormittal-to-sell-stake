Eregli Demir & Celik Fabrikalari
TAS (EREGL) ,  Turkey ’s largest steelmaker, dropped the most in more than
three years after ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker,
sold part of its stake.  Erdemir, as the company is also known, plunged 11 percent
to 3.58 liras in Istanbul after ArcelorMittal said it reduced
its ownership in Erdemir to 18.7 percent from 25 percent. The
loss was the biggest since November 2008.  ArcelorMittal sold 134.3 million Erdemir shares and an
equal number of warrants for 478.2 million liras ($268 million),
it said in a statement today. The transaction valued Erdemir’s
shares at 3.56 liras a piece, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  ArcelorMittal’s stake will decline to 12.5 percent should
all warrants related to the sale be exercised,  ArcelorMittal (MT) 
said.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was hired to manage the sale,
ArcelorMittal said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
