The Pentagon’s top weapons buyer
has officially endorsed continuing development of  Lockheed
Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s  F-35 fighter jet and set cost targets for when
the program enters full-production.  Acting Undersecretary for Acquisition Frank Kendall today
signed an “acquisition decision memo” that approves the
current development phase and continuation of low-rate initial
production contracts.  Kendall may be asked about the memo and its implications by
senators tomorrow at the confirmation hearing on his nomination
as undersecretary for acquisition.  The memo discloses that full-rate production, the program’s
most profitable phase for Lockheed Martin, has been moved to
2019, a delay of seven years from the original goal that was set
in October 2001 and two years later than the current schedule.  Kendall set target costs for the program’s three aircraft
versions to meet before the Pentagon decides in 2019 to proceed.  The targets are expressed in a standard measure of aircraft
costs -- “unit recurring flyaway,” which represents basic
airframe production, in inflation-adjusted “then-year”
dollars.  The Navy model’s target is $93.3 million. The latest
comparable number is $210.6 million as negotiated in Lockheed
Martin’s fourth production contract.  The  Air Force ’s version has a 2019 target cost goal of
$83.4 million, down from $152.2 million.  The Marine Corps short-takeoff and vertical landing
version’s 2019 target cost is $108.1 million, down from $172.4
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
