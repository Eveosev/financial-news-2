Ophir Energy Plc, a U.K. explorer
focused on  Africa , sold about 151 million pounds ($240 million)
of new shares to expand operations in Tanzania, Kenya and  Gabon .  The company sold 30.5 million shares at 495 pence each, it
said today in a statement, representing about 8.3 percent of its
ordinary stock prior to the sale. JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd., RBC
 Capital Markets  and Oriel Securities Ltd. managed the sale.  Ophir’s assets are “the largest offshore acreage holding
in  East Africa ,” Chief Executive Officer Nick Cooper said today
in a separate statement. “We will continue to actively manage
this portfolio and once the resource potential of a particular
asset is well understood, we will work to introduce partners.”  The explorer, based in  London , and  BG Group Plc (BG/)  yesterday
announced the fourth natural-gas discovery off Tanzania. The
find brings the resource estimates from all four of Ophir and
BG’s wells close to 7 trillion cubic feet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
