Cyprus’s Minister of Commerce,
Industry and Tourism Neoklis Sylikiotis said the east
Mediterranean island must have a “considerable” stake in a
proposed liquefaction plant to export its natural gas.  “The state will participate with a considerable stake in
this project,” Sylikiotis, who is also responsible for energy,
said today in  Athens , according to an e-mailed transcript of his
speech. As construction costs will be “extremely high,” Cyprus
is seeking “multiparty cooperation with the involvement of
other important countries and energy giants,” he said.  Cyprus, which invited bids on Feb. 13 for a second oil and
gas licensing round, announced its first gas find in December.
The island is working with Israel, 300 miles (480 kilometers)
south across the  Mediterranean Sea , on the potential
construction of a pipeline to link their gas fields before the
fuel is liquefied for export to Europe or Asia, Israeli Prime
Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said Feb. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
