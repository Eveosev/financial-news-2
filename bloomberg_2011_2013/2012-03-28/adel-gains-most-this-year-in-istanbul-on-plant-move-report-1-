Adel Kalemcilik Ticaret & Sanayi
AS (ADEL) , a Turkish maker of office supplies part-owned by Faber-
Castell AG, gained the most this year after a report it will
move to a new plant and may use its existing plant for a real-
estate project.  Adel rose 2.8 percent to 32.80 liras at the close in
Istanbul, its biggest increase since Dec. 29.  Adel will expand output capacity by as much as 25 percent
with a plant it will build for about $25 million and will
evaluate real estate potential for the existing plant in
Istanbul, Dunya newspaper reported, citing chief executive Taner
Dursun.  To contact the reporter on this story:
