Saudi Arabia’s (OPCRSAUD)  Oil Minister Ali al-
Naimi said he wants to see lower crude prices to help stimulate
economic growth.  There is “no rational reason” for current high  oil
prices , al-Naimi said today in an editorial published in the
Financial Times, echoing comments he made to reporters in Doha,
Qatar on March 20. “Saudi Arabia would like to see a lower
price,” he wrote.  Brent crude  gained 15 percent this year partly because of
concern that tensions between Iran and western nations may
reduce exports. The market remains vulnerable to supply
disruptions from the  Middle East , Jeffery Currie, head of
commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said today in
a report.  “Fundamentally the market remains balanced,” al-Naimi
wrote. “It is the perceived potential shortage of oil keeping
prices high, not the reality on the ground. There is no lack of
supply. There is no demand which cannot be met.”  Saudi Arabia , the largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, raised output to the highest
level in more than three years in February, according to the
 International Energy Agency . The nation can increase production
by as much as 25 percent immediately if needed, the minister
said in Doha last week.  Brent declined 1.3 percent to $123.88 a barrel on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange at 5:57 p.m. London time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
