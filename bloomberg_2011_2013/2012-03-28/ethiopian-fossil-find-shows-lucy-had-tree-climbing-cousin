A partial fossil of a pre-human
foot has been found in Ethiopia, which researchers said proves
there were two species of hominins existing around 3.4 million
years ago.  It was previously thought that Australopithecus afarensis,
a slender-built hominid known as Lucy, was the only ancestor of
humans living at that time, research team leader Yohannes Haile-
Selassie told reporters in Ethiopia’s capital,  Addis Ababa ,
today.  The new find, which has a big toe that is splayed out to
the side demonstrating an ability to climb trees, shows
similarities with an ancestor that lived 4.4 million years ago,
said Yohannes. The fossil differs from Lucy’s toes, which are
aligned with each other.  “We never expected to find a foot like this with an
opposable toe at 3.4 million years,” he said. The findings from
the discovery of the so-called Burtele Partial Foot will be
published in science journal Nature tomorrow, Yohannes said.  The “eight elements of a right foot” were found by the
Woranso-Mille Paleontological Project in February 2009 in
Burtele, 50 kilometers (31 miles) north of Hadar town, in
 Ethiopia ’s northeastern Afar region. Lucy was also discovered in
Afar.  Cranial or dental specimens are needed to decide what
species of pre-human it belongs to, Yohannes said.  “We don’t have the evidence to say it belongs to this
species or this genus,” he said. Other findings from the area
show that the creature lived in the same area as hippopotamuses,
fish, crocodiles and turtles near a “large body of water and
abundant forest cover,” said Yohannes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
