UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s Bank Austria unit,
which owns the Italian lender’s eastern European business, said
profit declined by 71 percent last year as it wrote down its
Kazakh and Ukrainian banks and posted losses on Greek bonds.  Net income fell to 209 million euros ($279 million) in 2011
from 709 million euros a year earlier due to the charges, most
of which were reported in the third quarter. The bank didn’t
provide fourth-quarter results. Parent UniCredit yesterday said
fourth-quarter profit dropped 65 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
