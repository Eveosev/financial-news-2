New York Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain, who dislocated his right ankle while playing on a
trampoline with his 5-year-old son, said “there is a great
chance” he will return to  Major League Baseball  this season.  Chamberlain, 26, is on crutches and will be in a cast for
six weeks. The right-hander told reporters yesterday at the
Yankees’ spring training complex in Tampa,  Florida , that he did
not break any bones and has been infection-free.  “I felt like I let my team down,” Chamberlain said in a
news conference. “But my son is my pride and joy. I think that
was the biggest thing: Don’t be so hard on yourself, and realize
what you’re doing to try to be a good dad.”  Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said he was not sure
whether Chamberlain would be able to return in 2012.  “No one can tell you whether he’ll pitch this year or
not,” Cashman told reporters. “There’s a chance he can, and
there’s a chance he might not.”  Chamberlain wasn’t expected to return to the Yankees until
June or July because he was recovering from elbow ligament
replacement surgery last year.  “It’s going to give me more time to rehab,” the pitcher
said. “It’s going to allow me to continue my shoulder
strengthening and everything that goes along with that.”  In five seasons with the Yankees as a starter and reliever,
Chamberlain has a 20-13 record with an earned run average of
3.70. He will be paid $1.7 million this year and can become a
free agent after the 2013 season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
