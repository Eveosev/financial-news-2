Danieli SpA (DAN) , Italy’s biggest steel-
mill engineering company, plans to open a 500 million-euro ($667
million) plant in the western Serbian town of Sabac.  Danieli representatives and Serbian officials will sign a
memorandum of understanding in Belgrade tomorrow on developing
the steelworks, the office of Serbia’s President  Boris Tadic 
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Danieli’s Serbian unit plans to produce at least 750,000
tons of steel a year, aiming for annual turnover of 1 billion
euros, according to the statement. The factory, which is
expected to employ 1,000 people, will be exporting four-fifths
of the output. Buyers will include  Fiat SpA (F) , which will start
making its new 500L model in  Serbia , and its local suppliers.  The company will invest in speciality steel production and
plans to expand its initial 110,000 square-meter unit by
additional 80,000 square meters at a later stage, according to
the statement.  The Italian company arrives in Serbia two months after U.S.
Steel Corp. sold back to the government its unprofitable steel
plant in the eastern city of Smederevo for a token $1 in
January. Its plant was producing one million metric tons of
steel compared with annual capacity of 2.2 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
