Samsung Group  agreed to buy a 15
percent stake in 2Co Energy Ltd.’s carbon-capture and storage
project for a power plant in northern England.  Samsung C&T (000830) , the construction and trading arm of Samsung
Group, will build the 650-megawatt coal-fired Don Valley Power
Project in South Yorkshire, London-based 2Co Energy said today
in an e-mailed statement. Financial details weren’t disclosed.  The project will capture 90 percent of its carbon dioxide
emissions to help in the extraction of 150 million barrels of
oil from the  North Sea , 2Co Energy said. Work at the plant is
scheduled to begin in 2013, 2Co said on Jan. 31. It is due to
start operating in 2016.  The U.K. yesterday started a 1 billion-pound carbon capture
and storage funding program as it seeks to meet energy demand
without adding to pollution. The full process of capturing,
transporting and storing CO2 hasn’t yet been successfully
deployed on a commercial scale at  power plants .  2Co’s project, which will cost about 3 billion pounds ($4.8
billion), has won 180 million euros ($240 million) in funding
under the European Energy Programme for Recovery and is being
considered for further grants from the European Commission, 2Co
Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
