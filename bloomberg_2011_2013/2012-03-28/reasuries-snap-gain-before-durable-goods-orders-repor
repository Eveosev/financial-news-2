Treasuries fluctuated before the
government sells $35 billion in five-year securities, the second
of three note sales this week totaling $99 billion.  Ten-year note yields touched a two-week low as investors
sought safety after durable-goods orders trailed forecasts and
the  Federal Reserve  bought the biggest percentage of debt
offered by dealers since January. The Fed bought $4.81 billion
of Treasuries today due from August 2020 to November 2021.
Stocks fell.  “You’re facing weaker equity markets and a programmatic
buyer, so why fight it?” said  Chris Ahrens , head U.S. interest-
rate strategist at UBS AG in Stamford,  Connecticut , one of the
21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. The Fed purchase is
“obviously helping support the sector in general.”  Benchmark 10-year note yields fell less than one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.18 percent at 12:23 p.m.
New York time, after touching 2.16 percent, the lowest since
March 14. They increased earlier to 2.22 percent, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.  Five-year notes yielded 1.01 percent after rising earlier
to as high as 1.05 percent.  The U.S. central bank bought 42 percent of the amount of
Treasuries that dealers offered to it today, the biggest
percentage since Jan. 31. The average at the past five purchases
is 31 percent. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday
unemployment remains too high and the recovery in the  U.S.
economy  isn’t assured.  To contact the reporter on this story:
