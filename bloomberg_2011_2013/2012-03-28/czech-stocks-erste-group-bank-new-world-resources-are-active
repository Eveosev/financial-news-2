The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
dropped 0.3 percent to 987.1 at its close in Prague, after
earlier touching the lowest intraday level in two months.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)   of Austria fell 1.1 percent
to 443.6 koruna, a seventh day of losses and the lowest close
since Feb. 1. Financial stocks were among the worst performers
in Europe today after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the U.S. recovery isn’t assured.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, fell to 134 koruna from 137.5 koruna yesterday as
commodities plunged and the stock traded without the right to a
dividend of 0.07 euros, equivalent to 1.7 koruna. Excluding the
effect of the dividend, the stock slid 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
