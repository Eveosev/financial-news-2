Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
second day as tea and coffee sales increased at weekly sales,
leading to a higher inflow of dollars.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy appreciated
as much as 0.4 percent to 82.80 per dollar and was trading 0.1
percent stronger at 82.98 to the dollar at 12:16 p.m. in

doubled to 7,002 bags, the exchange said. African tea prices
rose to an average of $2.79 a kilogram from $2.74 last week at a
