Ghana will ship two 950,000-barrel
cargoes of Jubilee crude in May, one less than April, a revised
loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Exports for May were originally planned at three shipments,
according to a preliminary plan.  The Jubilee field is operated by London-based  Tullow Oil
Plc (TLW)  and started production in December 2010.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
