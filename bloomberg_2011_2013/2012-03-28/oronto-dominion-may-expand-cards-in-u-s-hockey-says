Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , Canada’s
second-largest bank, may expand its credit-card business in the
U.S., said Tim Hockey, the lender’s group head of Canadian
banking.  Toronto-Dominion’s  acquisition  of  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s
MBNA Canadian credit-card portfolio in December gives his bank a
revenue “cushion,” said Hockey, speaking today at an investor
conference in Montreal. The Toronto-based company will expand
its card business “dependent on our store strategy,” he said.  The bank has about 1,300 branches in the U.S., more than it
has in Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
