French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  is
in favor of releasing oil from the nation’s strategic stockpile
to lower crude prices, according to a Le Monde  blog  posting,
citing people it didn’t identify who are close to his office.  France  is in contact with the British and U.S. governments
on whether a release similar to that undertaken last year during
the rebellion in Libya should be repeated in the coming weeks,
the newspaper reported.  French Industry Minister Eric Besson said last week
releasing some strategic oil supplies is “one option” being
considered to counter rising prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
