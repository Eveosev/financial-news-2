Liverpool will face Italian club
Roma at Fenway Park in  Boston  during its preseason tour of North
America, the Premier League soccer team said on its website.  The July 25 match will be part of the 100th anniversary
celebration of Fenway, home of the Boston Red Sox. Liverpool and
the Red Sox are both owned by Fenway Sports Group.  Liverpool owner John Henry said the match between “two of
the world’s most well-known and respected clubs” will
“showcase our ballpark to an international audience.”  The full schedule of the 12-day tour will be announced at a
later date, Liverpool said. The Reds last visited North America
in 2004, playing matches in  Connecticut , New Jersey and Toronto.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
