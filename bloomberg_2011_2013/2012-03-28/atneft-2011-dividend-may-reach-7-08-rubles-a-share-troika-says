OAO Tatneft (TATN) , a regional Russian oil
producer, may increase dividend payments to 7.08 rubles a share
after net income rose to 54.9 billion rubles ($1.89 billion)
last year, Troika Dialog said.  The payout has been 30 percent of net income under Russian
accounting standards for the past five years at the insistence
of the Tatarstan region’s government, a “key” shareholder in
the Almetyevsk-based oil producer, Troika analysts Alex Fak,
 Oleg Maximov  and Valery Nesterov wrote today in a note.  The dividend would imply a yield of 6.8 percent on
preferred shares and 3.5 percent on common shares, Troika said.  Profit rose 45 percent from the previous year, the company
said in a statement on its website yesterday. Local standards
are not a good indicator of net income under U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, the Troika analysts said.  Bloomberg analysts  forecast  dividends of 7.50 rubles a
share for the year, compared with 5.02 rubles for 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
