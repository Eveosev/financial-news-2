Western  Canada  Select oil weakened
after a March 26 fire struck a process unit at  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM) ’s Billings refinery in  Montana .  Production wasn’t “significantly impacted,” Rachael
Moore, a Fairfax, Virginia-based spokeswoman for Exxon, said in
an e-mail earlier this week.  Western Canada Select (USCSWCAS) ’s discount widened $3.50 to $27.50 a
barrel at 3:42 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The refinery imported about 25,000 barrels a day of
oil with gravity below 30 API from Canada in December, according
to the Energy Department.  Thunder Horse ’s premium to WTI added 30 cents to $19.30 a
barrel.  Mars Blend (USCSMARS)  increased 10 cents to a premium of $15.70
over the U.S. benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s (USCSLLSS)  premium to WTI added $1.20 to
$21.90 a barrel.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet (USCSHLSE) ’s premium increased 25
cents to $23.50 a barrel.  Poseidon’s premium narrowed 40 cents to $14.85, while
Southern Green Canyon’s premium declined 50 cents to $15.75 a
barrel.  West Texas Sour (USCSWTSM) ’s discount widened 80 cents to $5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
