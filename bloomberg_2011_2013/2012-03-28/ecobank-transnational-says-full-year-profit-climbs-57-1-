Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , the
Lome, Togo-based owner of banks in sub-Saharan  Africa , said
full-year profit rose 57 percent to $206.8 million as it curbed
losses and boosted revenue.  Net interest income in the year through December climbed to
$583.4 million from $474.8 million a year earlier, the company
said in a statement e-mailed by the Ghana Stock Exchange today.  The results are attributable to “strong growth in revenue
and efficient management of cost,” said Derrick Mensah, a
research analyst SIC Financial Services Ltd., said by phone from
Accra, the capital, today. Impairment losses on loans and
advances narrowed to $85.7 million in 2011 from $101.5 million a
year earlier, the company said.  Ecobank Transnational’s shares rose 9.1 percent in  Ghana  to
12 pesewas by the close. In Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital,
the stock gained 0.2 percent to 11 naira.  To contact the reporter on this story:
