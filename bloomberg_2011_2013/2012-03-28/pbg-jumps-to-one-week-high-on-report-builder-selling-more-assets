PBG SA (PBG)  climbed to a one-week high
after PAP news service reported  Poland ’s third-largest
construction company is selling properties to help pay off debt.  The shares climbed 5.9 percent to 41.26 zloty, the highest
since March 21, as of 10:16 a.m. in Warsaw, extending
yesterday’s 14 percent gain.  PBG’s Galeria Kujawska real-estate unit has signed a
preliminary agreement to sell properties for 122 million zloty
($39.3 million), PAP reported late yesterday, citing PBG
spokeswoman Kinga Banaszak-Filipiak.  The builder needs to raise funds as payment delays and
growing foreign competition for contracts sent net debt surging
to 1.46 billion zloty at the end of 2011 from 585 million zloty
the same period a year earlier, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
