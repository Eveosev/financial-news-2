Tokyo Electric Power Co. said it
found the highest radiation levels inside one of the crippled
reactors at its Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant since the
disaster in March last year.  Radiation levels  inside the No. 2 reactor containment
vessel were between 31.1 and 72.9 sieverts per hour, Naohiro
Omura, a spokesman for the utility, said by phone. The high
levels indicate the presence of radioactive substances from
melted fuel inside the containment chamber, said Omura.  The findings came more than three months after Tepco and
the government declared they succeeded in bringing the crippled
reactors into a safe state known as cold shutdown. Tepco will
need to conduct further studies to see whether the high
radiation levels would affect its plan to decommission the
reactors within 30 to 40 years, Omura said.  “We still believe melted fuel is being cooled” as the
water temperature was between 48.5 and 50 degrees Celsius (119.3
and 122 degrees Fahrenheit) even as the water level inside the
containment was lower than expected, Omura said. The water level
was 60 centimeters from the bottom of the containment vessel,
compared with as much as 4.5 meters estimated by the utility
before the investigation, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
