Portugal’s two-year notes rose for
a 10th day, the longest run of gains in three years, amid
optimism the region’s debt crisis is easing.  The extra  yield  investors demand to hold the nation’s 10-
year bonds instead of benchmark German bunds narrowed the least
in four months. The euro area’s woes are “almost over,”
Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said today. Most  Europe  10-
year bonds rose after a report showed inflation in  Germany ,
Europe’s largest economy, slowed in March, helping preserve the
purchasing power of the fixed payments from debt.  “Portugal remains the most attractive of the high-yielding
markets,” said  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of euro-area rate strategy
at Societe Generale SA in Paris. “The Portuguese market has
been outperforming because there’s been no major news elsewhere
in the euro area. It’s afforded a respite, allowing Portuguese
spreads to narrow.”  The country’s two-year yield dropped 13 basis points, or
0.13 percentage point, to 9.37 percent at 4:47 p.m. London time
after falling to 9.22 percent, the lowest since April 14. The
5.45 percent note due September 2013 rose 0.19, or 1.9 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,331) face amount, to 94.76. The 10-day run is the
longest since February 2009.  Portugal ’s 10-year yield fell 21 basis points to 11.25
percent. The  spread  over bunds narrowed 115 basis points to 9.42
percentage points after reaching 9.28, the least since Nov. 24.
The measure set a euro-era record of 16.48 on Jan. 31.  Best Performer  Portuguese bonds have returned 13 percent this year, the
most of 26 sovereign markets tracked by indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Italian debt gained 11 percent, while German bunds
lost 0.2 percent.  Spanish bond advanced after Monti also said the risk of
contagion from Spain has decreased following measures taken to
boost Europe’s financial firewall.  European ministers will meet on March 30 in Copenhagen to
discuss whether to combine the temporary European Financial
Stability Facility with its permanent successor, the European
Stability Mechanism.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yield dropped two basis points to 5.33
percent after declining to 5.28 percent, the lowest level since
March 21.  Italian bonds also advanced, with the yield falling one
basis point to 5.11 percent. The Treasury sold 8.5 billion euros
of six-month bills at a yield of 1.119 percent, the lowest since
September 2010. Italy will sell as much as 8.25 billion euros of
five- and 10-year securities tomorrow.  German  inflation , calculated using a harmonized European
Union method, eased to 2.3 percent this month from 2.5 percent
in February, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said.  The 10-year bund gained for a second day with the yield
falling six basis points to 1.83 percent.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by Dutch securities, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and
credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
