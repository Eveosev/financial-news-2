Gulf International Services QSC (GISS) 
jumped the most in almost four years after the holding company
announced an imminent acquisition and the chairman was cited as
saying he seeks to double profits by 2016.  The shares soared 14 percent, the most since May 2008, to
26.70 riyals in Doha today, adjusted for a dividend of cash and
shares. The benchmark  QE Index (DSM)  added 0.2 percent. Gulf
International shares traded without the right to a cash dividend
of 1.18 riyals a share in addition to a 10 percent stock
dividend, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  The company expects its proposed acquisition of Amwaj
Catering Services be completed “imminently,” according to a
statement on the Qatar Exchange website yesterday. Gulf
International is also seeking to boost profit to 600 million
riyals ($165 million) by 2016, the Gulf Times reported, citing
Chairman Mohammed Al-Sada, who is also Qatar’s oil minister. Net
income was 300 million riyals in 2011.  “The stock is reacting to the acquisition announcement,
and it’s overshadowing the dilution effect of the dividend,”
said  Marwan Shurrab , assistant  fund manager  and chief trader at
Gulfmena Investments Ltd in Dubai.  To contact the reporter on this story:
