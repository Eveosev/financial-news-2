Sharp (6753)  Corp. shares were bid at
their daily limit in  Tokyo  after  Foxconn Technology Group (FOXCGZ)  and
founder Terry Gou agreed to invest 133 billion yen ($1.6
billion) in the TV maker and its display unit to secure flat
panels.  The shares weren’t traded and bid at 570 yen as of 9:49
a.m. in Tokyo, compared with yesterday’s closing price of 495
yen. Buy bids outnumbered sell offers about 4-to-1 after Foxconn
agreed to pay an 11 percent premium to buy the stock.  The deal, announced after the stock markets closed
yesterday, is the largest Japanese investment by a Taiwanese
buyer and includes an agreement to purchase as much as 50
percent of Sharp Display Products Corp.’s LCD panels.  Sharp (6753) ,
which last month forecast a record 290 billion-yen loss for the
fiscal year as TV prices dropped, may begin supplying panels for
Apple’s iPad next month, according to researcher IHS Inc.  “They are in trouble and their very survival is at
stake,” Edwin Merner, president of Tokyo-based Atlantis
Investment Research, which manages $300 million, said about
Sharp. “Maybe the tie-up will help.”  Foxconn entities will buy 121.65 million new shares in
Sharp for 550 yen each, according to Sharp’s statement. Sharp
 shares  closed at 495 yen in Tokyo yesterday before the
announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
