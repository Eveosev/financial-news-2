The Bovespa index fell to a six-
week low as a drop in commodities prices pushed raw-material
producers down amid concern growth will falter in  China ,
Brazil’s biggest trading partner.  Mining company  Vale SA (VALE5) , whose top export market is China,
slid as metals prices declined.  BM&FBovespa SA (BVMF3) , the operator of
Latin America’s biggest securities exchange, sank the most in
four weeks after a court ordered it to pay 8.42 billion reais
($4.62 billion) in a civil case.  The Bovespa fell 1.5 percent to 65,079.34 at the close of
trading in  Sao Paulo . Fifty-five stocks dropped on the gauge
while 14 advanced. The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.8259 per
 U.S. dollar . The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 raw
materials fell 1.2 percent.  China’s biggest copper producer and largest airline posted
profits that trailed estimates yesterday, joining banks and
energy companies with results that indicate slower economic
growth is dragging down corporate earnings.  “Given its size, every little sign of a deeper slowdown in
China has a big effect on the market, especially in  Brazil ,
where many listed companies depend on commodities exports,”
Leandro Martins, head of research at Walpires SA, said in a
phone interview.  Vale lost 1.7 percent to 40.66 reais today.  Cia.
Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3) , Brazil’s third-biggest steelmaker,
tumbled 3 percent to 17.35 reais.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,
Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, dropped 1.7 percent to
23.39 reais, following crude prices lower. The MSCI
Brazil/Materials index fell the most since March 12.  BM&FBovespa Slides  BM&FBovespa slumped 2.6 percent to 11.69 reais. The Sao
Paulo-based company said it was found liable of being involved
in losses incurred by the central bank related to futures
trading near the time of the 1999  currency devaluation .  When Brazil devalued the real in 1999, the central bank
sold dollars to banks that were short selling the U.S. currency
in the local  derivatives market . BM&FBovespa is accused of
benefiting from the transaction.  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3) , Brazil’s sixth-biggest homebuilder by
revenue, rose 0.7 percent to 10.33 reais. The company reported
adjusted net income of 87 million reais in the fourth quarter,
which compares with the average of 78.1 million reais in a
Bloomberg survey of 10 analysts.  Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais , the state-controlled
electricity utility serving  Minas Gerais  state, dropped 0.3
percent to 43.95 after earlier rising as much as 3 percent.
Cemig said its net income was 710 million reais in the fourth
quarter, compared with an average estimate of 470 million reais
among seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Quarterly Gain  Brazil’s benchmark equity  measure  has advanced 15 percent
this year, heading for its biggest quarterly gain since the
period ended September 2009. Stocks have been buoyed by
interest-rate cuts in  Latin America ’s largest economy, signs of
growth in the U.S. and speculation  Europe  may be closer to
solving its debt crisis.  The Bovespa trades at 10.8 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, which compares with a 10.6 ratio for MSCI Inc.’s
measure of 21 developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Traders  moved  6.84 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 7.19 billion reais this year through March 16,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
