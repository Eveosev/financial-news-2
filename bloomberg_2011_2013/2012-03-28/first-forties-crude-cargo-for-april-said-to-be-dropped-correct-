A cargo of North Sea Forties crude
for loading in April was dropped, according to three people with
knowledge of the export program.  The shipment with parcel number F0406 was removed from the
program, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the information is confidential. This brings total shipments for
next month to 23. Each consignment is for 600,000 barrels.  Total SA (FP) , the owner of the cargo, halted its Elgin-Franklin
fields following a gas leak on March 25.  The F0410 cargo was delayed to April 14 to April 16, one
day later than planned, the people said. So far a total of six
shipments for loading next month have been deferred by one to
nine days.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
