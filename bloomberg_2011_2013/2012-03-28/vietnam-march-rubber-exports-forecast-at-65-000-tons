Vietnam , the fourth-biggest rubber
exporter in 2010, may ship 65,000 tons this month, according to
figures today from the General Statistics Office in Hanoi, 55
percent more than in the same period last year.  Exports in the first three months of the year were
estimated at 223,000 tons, up 38 percent from a year earlier.
The nation shipped 89,000 metric tons in February, down 19
percent from a previous assessment of 110,000 tons, figures from
the Statistics Office show.  Vietnam exported 42,000 tons in March last year according
to preliminary GSO data.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
