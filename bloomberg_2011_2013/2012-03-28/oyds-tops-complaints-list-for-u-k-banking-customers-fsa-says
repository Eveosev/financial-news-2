Bank complaints in the U.K. rose 21
percent during the second half of last year, driven by an
increase in insurance claims, the U.K. financial watchdog said.  Payment protection insurance complaints rose by 85 percent
to 977,510 the FSA said in a  statement  on its website.  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  received a total of 281,484 complaints while  Lloyds Banking
Group Plc (LLOY)  faced 240,923 total complaints, according to FSA data.  Lloyds posted a wider-than-estimated full-year loss last
month due to reimbursing customers for improperly-sold payment
protection insurance, or PPI. The British Bankers’ Association,
an industry group, lost a court challenge last year to stop the
regulator from ordering lenders to pay compensation.  “We want to be the best bank for customers, so getting
customer service right is vital,” Martin Dodd, customer
services director at Lloyds, said in an e-mailed statement.  Barclays said it had reduced complaints over banking
services by 31 percent year on year.  “Complaints are still higher than our customers should
expect, but we are on the right track in bringing them down,”
 Antony Jenkins , chief executive of Barclays retail and business
banking, said in an e-mailed statement.  Overall complaints about banking services fell to the
lowest level since the second half of 2006, to 787,096, the FSA
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
