South Africa has the potential to be
a leader in fuel cells with government help,  Anglo American Plc (AAL) 
Chief Executive Officer  Cynthia Carroll  said.  “Prioritizing the development of a local fuel cell
industry will create many thousands of jobs,” Carroll said
according to an e-mailed copy of comments to a conference in
Durban today. “The focus now must be to promote strong, viable
local manufacturing industry that supports everyday use.”  Platinum-based fuel cells are versatile, scalable and are
able to convert hydrogen into electricity efficiently, Anglo
said in a statement.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. is the world’s biggest
producer of the metal, operating mainly in South Africa, which
has the largest platinum reserves of any country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
