Network Rail Ltd. executives should
renounce their bonus payments for this year, according to the
 Rail Freight Group  industry association, the Sunday Times
reported, citing a letter from RFG Chairman Tony Berkeley.  The executives should not take their bonuses because of the
U.K.’s economic situation, Berkeley wrote in a letter to Rick Haythornthwaite, chairman of Network Rail, the Sunday Times
reported.  Berkeley is one of the key figures responsible for holding
the board of Network Rail to account, the Sunday Times said. He
also wants Haythornthwaite to reveal what executives would be
paid if performance doesn’t improve, the newspaper said.  Network Rail said Berkeley raised some important questions
that would be addressed by the board at a meeting this week, the
Sunday Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
