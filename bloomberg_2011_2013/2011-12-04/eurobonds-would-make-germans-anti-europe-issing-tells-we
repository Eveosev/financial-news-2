Eurobonds would turn Germans against
Europe, former European Central Bank Chief Economist  Otmar Issing   told  Welt am Sonntag in an interview.  Joint bonds would increase the cost of German borrowing,
leaving the country’s taxpayers with the bill for a process
which would get “out of control” and increase their antipathy
toward Europe, Issing told Welt. He added that the crisis was an
opportunity to improve the groundwork of the common currency,
according to Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
