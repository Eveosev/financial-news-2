Brazil ’s Labor Minister Carlos Lupi
resigned today, the sixth Cabinet member to leave President
Dilma Rousseff’s government since June amid corruption
allegations.  Lupi denied any wrongdoing and said he was the victim of
“political and personal persecution,” according to a statement
published on the ministry’s website. He ran the ministry since
2007.  “I leave with a clear conscience after fulfilling my
duties,” the statement said.  Since June, Rousseff has lost her Cabinet chief and the
ministers of transportation, agriculture, tourism and sports
over allegations of corruption. All have denied wrongdoing.  The defense minister stepped down in August after
criticizing other members of the government.  Veja magazine reported Nov. 5 that top Lupi aides allegedly
took kickbacks from non-governmental organizations, or NGOs,
that won ministry contracts. The magazine also reported that in
2009 Lupi flew to public functions in a private airplane rented
by the head of an NGO that received 14 million reais ($7.9
million) from the ministry.  Lupi, 54, denied the allegations at the time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
