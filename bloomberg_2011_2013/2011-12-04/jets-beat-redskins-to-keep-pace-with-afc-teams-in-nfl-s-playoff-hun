Shonn Greene  scored three touchdowns
as the  New York Jets  beat the  Washington Redskins  to keep pace
for a National Football League wild card playoff spot.  The Jets won 34-19 to improve to 7-5, leaving them tied
with the Cincinnati Bengals, Tennessee Titans,  Oakland Raiders 
and  Denver Broncos  in the American Football Conference. They’re
two games behind New England in the AFC East after the Patriots
beat Indianapolis 31-24 to improve to 9-3 and drop the Colts to
0-12 for the first time since 1986.  The Jets came into today’s contest having lost four in row
to Washington, with their only win in nine previous meetings
coming 18 years ago. New York won last week ending a two-game
losing run, while  Washington  began the game after ending a six-
game losing skid a week ago.  It was 7-7 through the first quarter at FedEx Field in
Landover,  Maryland , after Washington’s Roy Helu and the Jets’
Greene scored.  Graham Gano made field goals from 33 and 23 yards for the
Redskins and  Nick Folk  made it 13-13 with one quarter to play
with field goals from 45 yards and a season-best 51 yards for
New York.  Gano restored Washington’s three-point advantage with seven
minutes, 56 seconds to play with his third field goal of the
game, from 46 yards.  Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez found Santonio Holmes on a
30-yard play with his 19th touchdown pass of the season to make
it 20-16 to New York with 4:49 to play.  On their next possession, Redskins quarterback Rex Grossman
fumbled after a sack by Aaron Maybin, and Greene got his second
touchdown on a 9-yard run to make it 27-16 to the Jets with 3:48
to play.  Fourth Field Goal  Gano then kicked his fourth field goal, from 43 yards, to
make it 27-19 with 2:04 remaining. Five seconds later, Greene
capped the scoring with a touchdown run from 25 yards.  The Colts were tied 3-3 with the Patriots until three
minutes before halftime at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough,
 Massachusetts , when  Rob Gronkowski  caught an 11-yard pass for a
touchdown from  New England  quarterback Tom Brady.  Gronkowski got two more scores and Benjarvus Green-Ellis
drove into the end zone from 1 yard out as the Patriots opened a
31-3 lead after three quarters.  Indianapolis then scored three times, first on a 5-yard run
by Donald Brown, then on a 33-yard pass to Pierre Garcon from
quarterback Dan Orlovsky, in his first start since 2008.
Orlovsky also threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Garcon with 40
seconds remaining.  The Broncos (7-5) made it six wins in seven starts behind
quarterback  Tim Tebow  with a 35-32 victory over the  Minnesota 
Vikings (2-10). The Titans are also 7-5 after a 23-17 win
against the Buffalo Bills (6-6).  Denver, Oakland Tied  Denver made two field goals in the final 1:33 and is now
tied with Oakland atop the AFC West after the Raiders lost for
the first time in four games, 34-14 to the Miami Dolphins (3-9).
Miami has now won four out of five games after opening the
season with seven defeats.  Tebow, who began the game ranked the lowest in the NFL for
passing accuracy at 45.5 percent, found Demaryius Thomas with 41
and 21-yard scoring passes in the third quarter.  After Percy Harvin scored a 48-yard touchdown pass from
Christian Ponder to put Minnesota up 29-21, Willis McGahee
scored on a 24-yard run for Denver and Tebow ran for a two-point
conversion to tie the game with 8:52 left.  Field goals from 39 yards by Minnesota’s Ryan Longwell and
46 yards by Denver’s Matt Prater made it 32-32 before Prater
kicked a 23-yard field goal as time expired.  Steelers Win  The Pittsburgh Steelers, who began the day tied atop the
AFC North with the  Baltimore Ravens , beat the  Cincinnati Bengals 
35-7 to improve to 9-3. The Ravens today visit the  Cleveland
Browns , who have lost their past six games between the division
rivals. At 7-5, the Bengals fall into a tie for the AFC’s final
wild card playoff berth with the loss.  The Kansas City Chiefs (5-7) ended a four-game winless run
with a 10-3 win over the Chicago Bears (7-5).  The Detroit Lions (7-4) can move ahead of the Bears alone
in second place behind the unbeaten Green Bay Packers in the
National Football Conference North division by handing the NFC
South-leading New Orleans Saints (8-3) their first defeat in
four games tonight.  The Houston Texans won in their first game with third-
string quarterback T.J. Yates, beating the Atlanta Falcons
17-10. Yates took over as the starter when backup  Matt Leinart 
was lost for the season after breaking a collarbone against
Jacksonville a week ago. Houston (9-3) has won six straight
games as it chases its first playoff berth since joining the NFL
in 2002.  The Falcons drop to 7-5 with their first defeat in three
games. The Saints lead the NFC South with an 8-3 record ahead of
tonight’s game against the Lions.  Rookie quarterback Cam Newton rushed for three touchdowns,
giving him a league-record 13 this season, as the  Carolina
Panthers  won two games in a row for the first time this year to
improve to 4-8. Carolina won 38-19 to send the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers (4-8) to their sixth straight loss.  The previous mark of 12 rushing touchdowns by a quarterback
in a single season was set by former Patriot Steve Grogan in
1976.  Also today, the  New York  Giants (6-5) seek to end a three-
game losing run and keep pace with the NFC East-leading Dallas
Cowboys (7-4) at home against the Packers (11-0).  Division Title  A victory for Green Bay, coupled with a loss for the Lions,
will secure the NFC North title for the Super Bowl champion.  The Packers’ winning run began in the next-to-last week of
the 2010 regular season with a 45-17 win over the Giants, which
ensured New York missed the postseason for a second straight
year.  The Cowboys visit the Arizona Cardinals (4-7) seeking a
fifth straight victory, while the San Francisco 49ers, who lead
the NFC West with a 9-3 record, visit the St. Louis Rams (2-9),
who are last in the division, in the day’s other game.  Week 12, which began Dec. 1 with a 31-14 win for the
Seattle Seahawks (5-7) over the  Philadelphia Eagles  (4-8), wraps
up tomorrow with the Jacksonville Jaguars (3-8) hosting the San
Diego Chargers (4-7).  To contact the reporter on this story:
