Barclays Plc (BARC)  plans to pay its
investment bankers 5 billion pounds ($7.7 billion) in salaries,
bonuses and perks this year, the Sunday Times reported, even as
the  Bank of England  seeks a limit on payouts.  The sum is equivalent to an average of 210,000 pounds per
employee, according to the newspaper. London bankers’ bonuses
are likely to be substantially lower than previous years, the
Sunday Times said.  “All decisions on bonuses will be taken by the
remuneration committee in February next year,” the company said
today in an e-mailed statement to Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
