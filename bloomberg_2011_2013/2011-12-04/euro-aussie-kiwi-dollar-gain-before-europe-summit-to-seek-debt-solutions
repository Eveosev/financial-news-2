The euro rose against the  U.S.
dollar , as did the Australian and New Zealand currencies, before
a European summit this week where the regionâ€™s leaders will seek
to resolve their sovereign-debt crisis.  The 17-nation euro advanced to $1.3436 as of 7:49 a.m. in
Sydney, from $1.3391 on Dec. 2 in  New York .  The so-called Aussie dollar rose 0.5 percent to $1.0265,
while the kiwi currency climbed 0.4 percent to 78 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
