ThyssenKrupp AG  will sign a deal to
sell its shipbuilding unit  Blohm & Voss GmbH  to British investor
Star Capital Partners Ltd. within 14 days, Financial Times
Deutschland reported, citing sources close to the supervisory
board.  Agreement has already been reached over the valuation of
the unit, FTD said in a preview of an article to be published
tomorrow, citing supervisory board sources. The company’s
submarine-making unit would remain with ThyssenKrupp under the
terms of the deal, and Star Capital is obliged to retain all
employees, according to the FTD.  Investors have also expressed an interest in ThyssenKrupp’s
stainless steel business, FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
