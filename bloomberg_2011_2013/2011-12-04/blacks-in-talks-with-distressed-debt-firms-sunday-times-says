Blacks Leisure Group Plc (BSLA)  is in talks
with distressed-debt firms to secure fresh funding, the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  The retailer has appointed KPMG LLP to come up with a
rescue plan as low autumn sales hindered its ability to repay
debt, the newspaper said. The company needs an immediate cash
injection of 20 million pounds ($31 million), the Sunday Times
said, citing analysts it didnâ€™t identify.  Blacks needs to refinance 40 million pounds of debt with
 Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  in February next year, the newspaper
said. A spokesman for Blacks declined to comment when contacted
by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
