Venezuela reached an agreement with
 Gruma SAB (GRUMAB) ,  Mexico ’s largest producer of corn flour, to work
together in the South American country after Venezuelan
President  Hugo Chavez  seized one of its local units last year.  Chavez’s government and Gruma will form two joint ventures
to produce corn flour, rice, pasta and oatmeal, according to a
statement published on the Mexican Presidency’s website. The
agreement was made during a meeting in Caracas between Mexico’s
President Felipe Calderon and Chavez.  Chavez in May 2010 ordered the seizure of Molinos
Nacionales CA, a local unit belonging to Monterrey-based Gruma
that makes Robin Hood flour known as Monaca, after authorities
arrested a minority shareholder. The accord follows the
announcement by Venezuela Dec. 1 that it agreed to pay Mexican
cement maker Cemex SAB $600 million for a local unit that was
nationalized by Chavez in 2008.  These actions by the Venezuelan government will contribute
to a greater legal certainty which will encourage Mexican
companies to renew their interest in carrying out business in
 Venezuela , Calderon said, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
