Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird
said that his country’s relationship with U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration isn’t deteriorating after Obama’s
decision to delay approving a Canadian pipeline into the U.S.  “I don’t accept that,” Baird said in an interview on
 CTV’s Question Period  program today. “Prime Minister Harper and
President Obama have a good relationship.”  The $7 billion, 1,661-mile (2,673-kilometer) Keystone XL
pipeline, proposed by  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) , would carry Canadian
tar-sands crude through the Great Plains to the  Gulf of Mexico .
The U.S. State Department, which had been expected to decide on
approval of the project by the end of the year, said Nov. 10 it
was delaying its decision until early 2013 to consider
alternative routes. TransCanada has reached agreement with
Nebraska officials to change the route away from environmentally
sensitive areas.  Obama and Stephen Harper will meet in  Washington  Dec. 7 to
announce new measures to enhance security and trade between the
two countries.  Canada is not betting on the U.S. being the sole buyer of
its energy, Baird said. “If you’re a store you want to have
more than one customer.”  “Obviously, the U.S. is having some real economic
challenges, so it makes sense that we diversify our markets with
the Asia-Pacific region, with  Europe  and the Americas and that’s
something we’ve been working hard on.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
