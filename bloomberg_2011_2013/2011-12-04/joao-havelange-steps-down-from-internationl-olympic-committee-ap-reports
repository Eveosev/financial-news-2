Joao Havelange resigned as a member
of the  International Olympic Committee , the  Associated Press 
said, citing an unidentified person familiar with the decision.  The 95-year-old Brazilian, a member of the IOC since 1963,
submitted his resignation letter on Dec. 1, AP said.  Havelange faced suspension from the IOC over his part in a
bribery scandal stemming from his time as president of soccer’s
world governing body, the report said. Havelange was succeeded
by Sepp Blatter in 1998 after 24 years as the head of FIFA.  The IOC ethics commission began an inquiry after the
British Broadcasting Corp.’s Panorama program last year said
Havelange received $1 million from ISL, which owned World Cup
television rights and collapsed with debts of $300 million in
2001, AP said. Officials repaid $6.1 million in kickbacks, AP
reported, in return for anonymity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
