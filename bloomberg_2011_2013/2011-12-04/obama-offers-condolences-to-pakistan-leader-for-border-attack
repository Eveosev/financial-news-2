U.S. President  Barack Obama  called
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari to “personally express his
condolences” regarding a NATO attack that killed 24 Pakistani
soldiers, the White House said in a statement.  The president’s telephone call today came more than a week
after the Nov. 25 attack on Pakistani border posts by North
Atlantic Treaty Organization aircraft that triggered an angry
backlash in Pakistan.  Pakistan closed border crossings used by trucks shipping
supplies to the U.S. military in Afghanistan, ordered U.S.
personnel out of Shamsi Airbase in Baluchistan province and
announced plans to boycott an international conference on
Afghanistan to be held in  Germany .  “The president made clear that this regrettable incident
was not a deliberate attack on  Pakistan  and reiterated the
United States’ strong commitment to a full investigation,”
according to the White House statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
