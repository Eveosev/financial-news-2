The U.K.’s   Civil Aviation Authority 
has hired Alvarez & Marshal, a U.S. restructuring firm, to
advise it over  Thomas Cook Group Plc (TCG) , the Sunday Telegraph said.  The aviation regulator has enlisted the firm over concerns
surrounding the tour operator’s ability to pay a customer-
protection bond and fulfill its obligations on aircraft safety
should the financial strength of the company worsen, the
newspaper said. Nic Stevenson, a spokesman for the CAA declined
to comment and a spokeswoman for  Thomas Cook  also declined to
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.  Thomas Cook, which sought additional financing to weather
the seasonal low period of cash, plunged Nov. 22 after the
company said it was in talks with banks and delayed its full-
year results. Its lenders have since agreed to provide a 200
million-pound ($309 million) loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
