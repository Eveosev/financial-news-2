Deutsche Bahn AG  is in advanced talks
to sell its automotive unit Intertec GmbH, FTD reported, without
naming potential buyers or saying where it got the information.  The value of the sale would probably be less than 100
million euros ($134 million), FTD said.  “We are evaluating all options to improve the development
of Intertec,” DB Schenker spokesman Bernd Weiler told Bloomberg
by telephone. “There is at this stage no definitive decision.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
