Portsmouth  Football Club may get
short-term funding from Balram Chainrai, who sold the club six
months ago, the Sunday Times said, without saying where it got
the information.  Chainrai may provide the funding to protect a 17 million-
pound ($27 million) loan he is owed by the club, the newspaper
reported. Earlier this year Chainrai sold the club to Convers
Sports Initiatives Plc, which was placed in administration last
week, the Sunday Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
