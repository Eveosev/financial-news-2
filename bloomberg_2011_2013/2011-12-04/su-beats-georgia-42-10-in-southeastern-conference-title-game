Louisiana State University  beat the
University of Georgia 42-10 to win its 11th Southeastern
Conference title and remain undefeated, securing a spot in
college football’s national title game.  The Tigers (13-0) scored 35 second-half points yesterday
after being held without an offensive point or a first down for
the first half of the game at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.  “They came into the season to win a championship and
nothing will deter them,” LSU coach Les Miles said in a
televised interview. “After the first half, there was no
question the resolve was still there. We were just waiting to
get back on the field.”  Freshman running back Kenny Hilliard ran for two touchdowns
and scored on an 8-yard pass to lead LSU. Alfred Blue added a
48-yard touchdown run and Morris Claiborne ran an interception
back 45 yards in the game’s closing minutes to secure the win to
give LSU its first SEC title since 2007.  Cornerback Tyrann Mathieu returned a second-quarter punt 62
yards for the Tigers’ other score, a week after returning a punt
92 yards for a touchdown in LSU’s win over  Arkansas . Mathieu,
who also set up two LSU scores with a fumble recovery and
another punt return of 47 yards, was named the game’s Most
Valuable Player.  Change Game’s Momentum  “Obviously, we got off to a slow start. So I just felt
that I needed to change the momentum of the game,” Mathieu
said. “It was the perfect time with that punt return. Just
trying to make one guy miss and just get up the field.”  College football’s national championship game, which pits
the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the Bowl Championship Series
rankings, is scheduled for Jan. 9 in New Orleans. LSU, currently
ranked No. 1, last won the title after the 2007 season,
defeating Ohio State University 38-24 in  New Orleans .  The final BCS rankings will be released tomorrow. The
University of  Alabama , which defeated Auburn University 42-12 in
its final game on Nov. 28, is ranked No. 2.  A meeting between LSU and Alabama would set up a rematch of
their Nov. 5 meeting in which the Tigers defeated the Crimson
Tide 9-6 in overtime.  At Boone Pickens Stadium in Stillwater, Oklahoma, Joseph
Randle and Jeremy Smith each ran for two touchdowns as third-
ranked Oklahoma State defeated No. 10 Oklahoma 44-10 to win the
Big 12 championship.  Quinn Sharp added three field goals for Oklahoma State (11-
1, 8-1 Big 12). Blake Bell rushed for the only touchdown for
 Oklahoma  (9-3, 6-3 Big 12).  First Title  No. 20 Clemson upset fifth-ranked Virginia Tech 38-10 as
Tajh Boyd threw for touchdowns and ran for a fourth to lead the
Tigers to their first Atlantic Coast Conference championship
title in 20 years. The quarterback completed 20 of 29 passing
attempts for 240 yards for Clemson (10-3, 6-2 ACC).  Logan Thomas completed 22 of 44 passing attempts for 274
yards, one touchdown and two interceptions for the Hokies (11-2,
7-1 ACC).  Southern Mississippi (11-2, 6-2 C-USA), led by Austin
Davis’s four touchdown passes, handed sixth-ranked Houston its
first loss of the season with a 49-28 victory and captured the
Conference USA championship title. Davis completed 17 of 33
passing attempts for 279 yards and one interception.  Case Keenum, who completed 41 of 67 passing attempts, threw
for 373 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions for Houston
(12-1, 8-0 C-USA).  At Bronco Stadium,  Kellen Moore  passed for three touchdowns
and Doug Martin ran for two as seventh-ranked Boise State (11-1)
routed  New Mexico  (1-11) 45-0. Moore completed 28 passes for 313
yards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
