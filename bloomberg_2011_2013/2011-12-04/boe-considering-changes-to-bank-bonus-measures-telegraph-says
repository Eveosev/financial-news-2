The  Bank of England  is considering
changing the way it measures bankers’ bonuses to stem large
payouts, the Sunday Telegraph reported, citing a central bank
report.  The Bank of England’s Financial Stability Report flagged an
“early warning sign” on bonuses as the return-on-equity metric
took little account of risk, the newspaper reported.  Andy Haldane, the central bank’s executive director of
financial stability, and Robert Jenkins, an external member,
want bonuses to be measured against return on assets, the
Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
