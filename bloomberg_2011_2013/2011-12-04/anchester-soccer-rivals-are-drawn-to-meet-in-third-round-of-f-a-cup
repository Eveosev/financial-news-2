Defending champion  Manchester City 
will host record 11-time winner  Manchester United  in the third
round of English soccer’s F.A. Cup.  City, which currently tops the Premier League, beat  Stoke
City  1-0 in May’s F.A. Cup final to end a 35-year wait for a
trophy. Stoke starts its campaign at Gillingham, which plays in
the fourth-tier League Two.  The third round is the stage at which clubs from the elite
Premier League and the Championship enter the competition.  Newcastle is at home against Blackburn in the other all-
Premier League match. Arsenal, aiming to tie Man. United’s
record 11 successes, is at home against Leeds at this stage for
a second straight season. The Gunners are without a trophy since
winning the competition in 2005.  Everton hosts non-league club Tamworth, while Bolton may
have a trip to a club outside the four division Football League
if Chelmsford City beats Macclesfield Town in a second round
replay.  Here is the full third-round draw, with the matches
scheduled to be played over the weekend of Jan. 7 and Jan. 8:  To contact the reporter on this story:
