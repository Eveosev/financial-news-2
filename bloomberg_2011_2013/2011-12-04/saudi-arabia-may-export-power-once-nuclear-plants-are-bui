Saudi Arabia  may export
electricity to its neighbors after building nuclear
reactors planned over the next 20 years, an official at the
King Abdullah City of Atomic and  Renewable Energy  said.  “We are not ruling that out, once our nuclear project
is complete and we have satisfied the kingdom’s demand for
electricity,” Khalid Al-Sulaiman, vice president of
renewable energy at King Abdullah City said at a forum in
Jeddah today.  The Arab world’s largest economy needs an additional
2,000 megawatts of electricity a year to meet local needs
that the government forecasts to rise by 7 percent
annually, according to data from state-owned Saudi
Electricity Co., the country’s largest utility.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil producer in OPEC, faces
rising electricity demand from industries as it seeks to
diversify its crude-dependent economy. The government sees
nuclear energy as an additional source of power, along with
natural gas and oil, which it burns as fuel in its
generating stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
