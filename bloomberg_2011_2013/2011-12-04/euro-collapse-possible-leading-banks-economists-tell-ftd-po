Most chief economists at the world’s
leading international banks think that a breakup of the euro
zone is possible,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
its own survey.  Twelve out of 26 economists questioned saw a probability of
between 20 and 30 percent that a rupture of single currency
members would happen, while 10 saw a risk of 10 percent, the FTD
said in a preview of an article to be published tomorrow.
 Invesco Ltd. (IVZ) ’s Chief Economist  John Greenwood  saw the greatest
chance of a breakup at 70 percent, according to the FTD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
