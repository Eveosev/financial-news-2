Chile ’s central bank should consider
cutting interest rates to counter the effects of the European
debt crisis on the country’s economy, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain told La Tercera.  Chile may miss its target for 5 percent economic growth in
2012 because of the deterioration of European economies, which
is hurting copper prices and industries, Larrain told the
Santiago-based newspaper.  Chile’s government prepared a contingency plan in October
and is prepared to action it depending on developments in the
international economy, the paper cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
