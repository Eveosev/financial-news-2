UBS AG (UBSN)  Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti  was the third-choice candidate to take interim
leadership of the bank,  SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing several
unidentified people inside and outside UBS.  At a meeting in Singapore in September, the bank’s board
first asked Oswald Gruebel, the departing chief, to stay, before
approaching Ulrich Koerner, now Ermotti’s number two, the Swiss
newspaper reported.  Koerner refused the interim role because he saw it as
weakening his chances for the permanent job, later awarded to
Ermotti, the report said.  UBS spokesman Dominique Gerster declined to comment when
called by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
