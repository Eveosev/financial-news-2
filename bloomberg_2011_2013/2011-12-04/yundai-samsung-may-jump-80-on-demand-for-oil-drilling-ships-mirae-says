South Korean shipbuilding stocks may
jump as much as 80 percent in four months as they catch up with
gains in  oil prices , according to Mirae Asset Securities Co., an
affiliate of the nation’s second-largest money manager.  The  Korea KRX Shipbuilding Index (KRXSHIP) , which tracks Hyundai
Heavy Industries Co., Samsung Heavy Industries Co. and eight
other shipbuilding stocks, may rebound as rising oil prices spur
demand for drill ships and liquefied natural gas tankers, said
Lee Sokje, a Seoul-based Mirae analyst. The index has tumbled 42
percent since reaching the highest this year on May 2.  “Looking at how oil prices are doing, it’s only a matter
of time before shipyard shares follow,” Lee said by phone on
Dec. 2. “This is a very good opportunity to buy.”  Brent crude , the benchmark used to price two-thirds of
global oil supplies, has jumped about 9.8 percent since Oct. 4
because of easing economic concerns and political tensions in
 Iran . The price may rise to $127.50 a barrel at the end of next
year as the global economy avoids recession, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said in a Dec. 1 report. It traded at $109.60 Dec. 2.  Hyundai Heavy, the world’s largest shipyard, gained 1.9
percent today to 294,500 won, the highest closing price in more
than a month, in  Seoul .  Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering
Co. (042660)  gained 4.2 percent to 30,900 won, the highest closing price
in almost four months and the best performer on the  Kospi 50
Index (KOSPI50)  today. The Korea KRX Shipbuilding Index rose 1.9 percent.  Ship Slump  The  Bloomberg World Shipbuilding Index (BWSHIP)  has fallen about 32
percent this year as orders for vessels to carry containers,
commodities and oil have tumbled amid the European debt crisis
and a slump in freight rates caused by overcapacity.  This slowdown may affect Korean shipyards less than those
in  China  as shipbuilders including Hyundai Heavy, Samsung Heavy
and Daewoo Shipbuilding,  South Korea ’s three largest, have pared
their reliance on these traditional markets by focusing more on
energy-related products. South Korean yards may win more sales
from energy products than ships for the first time next year,
according to NH Investment & Securities Co.  South Korean shipyards have built 88 percent of drill ships
ordered since 2000 and 77 percent of LNG tankers since 2006,
according to Mirae Asset’s Lee. Hyundai Heavy, based in Ulsan,
South Korea, has won a record 11 drill-ship orders this year.
The vessels are used to bore test wells.  Mirae’s Lee has “buy” ratings on all six of the shipyards
he covers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He expects
Hyundai Heavy to rise to 540,000 won within 12 months, compared
with today’s closing price of 294,500 won.  The  shipyard (009540)  is rated “buy” by 37 analysts, with two
“hold” ratings and two “sell” ratings, according to
Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
