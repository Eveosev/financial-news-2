German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  will
eventually backtrack on her opposition to eurobonds, said her
predecessor  Gerhard Schroeder  in a Welt am Sonntag  interview .  It’s a “question of time” before she changes her mind,
Schroeder told Welt. The wealthier nations already subsidize
poorer states with structure and cohesion funds, he told Welt.
 Europe  needs its own credit rating company after suffering from
the politics of the U.S. agencies, he added, according to Welt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
