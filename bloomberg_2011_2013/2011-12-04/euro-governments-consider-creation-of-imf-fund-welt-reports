(Corrects newspaper attribution in second paragraph)  The governments of the 17-nation euro
zone are considering giving hundreds of billions of euros to the
 International Monetary Fund  in order to end the sovereign-debt
crisis,  Die Welt  reported, citing sources close to the
negotiations.  “Triple-digit billions” will be paid into the fund which
would then finance rescue programs for some countries, according
to Welt. Other central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve
are also said to be willing to contribute and Secretary of the
Treasury Tim Geithner will fly to Europe this week to meet with
politicians and bankers, Welt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
