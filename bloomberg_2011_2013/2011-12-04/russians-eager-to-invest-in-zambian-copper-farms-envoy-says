Russian businesses are seeking large-
scale investments in mines and farms in Zambia,  Russia ’s
ambassador to  Africa ’s biggest copper producer said.  “One of the greatest attractions Zambia has is its
predictable political stability, which creates a good investment
environment,” Boris Malakhov said in an interview in the Zambian
capital Lusaka. “That’s why Russian companies want to come and
invest not just in copper but in other areas,” including
construction and agriculture, he said.  The southern African country produced more than 700,000
metric tons of copper last year and is targeting 1.5 million
tons by 2014. The government wants economic growth to exceed 7
percent next year compared with an estimated 6.5 percent
expansion in 2011, Finance Minister Alexander Chikwanda said in
a speech in Lusaka in Nov. 11.  Malakhov said he has received “overwhelming applications
and expressions of interest from Russian companies that are
eyeing  Zambia  as their next best investment destination.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
