Mexico ’s President Felipe Calderon,
marking his fifth year in office, said organized crime gangs
threaten democracy and pose his biggest challenge in returning
security to the country.  About 43,000 people have died in drug-related violence
since Calderon launched his offensive against drug cartels when
he took office Dec. 1, 2006, according to an Oct. 4 report by
the Drug Enforcement Administration. The most recent evidence
includes the discovery of  26 dead  in Guadalajara in abandoned
trucks last month and an arson attack on a casino that killed 52
people in Monterrey in August.  “Those who say that it would’ve been better not to
confront the criminals are roundly mistaken,” Calderon said
during an event in Mexico City. “If we hadn’t done this, the
criminals would have advanced on our societies and
institutions.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
