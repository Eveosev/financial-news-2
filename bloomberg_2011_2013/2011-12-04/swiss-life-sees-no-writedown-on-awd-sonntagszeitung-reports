Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  Chairman Rolf
Doerig said the company sees no reason to write down 1.1 billion
Swiss francs ($1.19 billion) in goodwill attributed to AWD
Holding AG,  SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing an interview.  Doerig also sees no need for Swiss Life to raise capital in
order to meet regulatorsâ€™ requirements, the Swiss newspaper
said. Swiss Life bought AWD in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
