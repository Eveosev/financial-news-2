Qatar Petroleum  and  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  signed a heads of agreement to develop a petrochemicals
plant in the Gulf country for an estimated cost of $6.4 billion.  State-run Qatar Petroleum will have an 80 percent stake in
the project and Shell the remainder, the companies said today in
Doha. They plan to sign a final joint-venture agreement by the
end of next year or early in 2013, Qatari Oil Minister Mohammed al-Sada told reporters in the country’s capital. The project
would be completed in 2017, he said.  The Shell venture would not replace one that  Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)  proposed two year ago, and the country plans more
petrochemicals projects, al-Sada said. He estimated the Shell
complex’s costs at $6.4 billion. OPEC-member Qatar is the
world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas.  The heads of agreement sets the scope and commercial
principals for the project, which would include a steam cracker
and a mono-ethylene glycol plant with a capacity of 1.5 million
metric tons a year, Qatar Petroleum and Shell said in a
statement. The complex would be able to produce 300,000 tons a
year of linear alpha olefins, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
