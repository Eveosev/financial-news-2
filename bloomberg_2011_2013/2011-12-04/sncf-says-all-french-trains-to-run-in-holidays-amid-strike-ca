Français,  France ’s state-owned rail company, expects all trains
in the country to run during the year-end holidays amid calls by
a labor union for a strike, Chairman Guillaume Pepy said.  “Trains will be circulating during the year-end
holidays,” he said today in an  interview  on Europe1 radio.
“There will be all the trains scheduled.”  The FGAAC-CFDT union representing some rail workers filed a
strike notice for the four weekends of December, including for
Christmas and the New Year, it said in a Dec. 2.  statement  The
union is protesting against the “degradation of the work and
life conditions” of train drivers, according to the statement.  SNCF, as the railway is known, has almost always reached an
accord with unions in the past, Pepy said. Only one plans to
strike as others seek to avoid stoppages in holidays, he said.  “This strike wouldn’t be fair to other rail workers,”
Pepy said. “It would be wise for this labor union to renounce
the strike notice. If the stoppage took place -- and I don’t
think it will -- customers would consider it somehow like being
taken hostage. They wouldn’t be totally wrong.”  SNCF has 241,000 employees, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
