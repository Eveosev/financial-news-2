French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  may not reach an agreement on
proposals to overhaul European institutions tomorrow,  Le Journal
du Dimanche  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  Sarkozy said last week he would meet Merkel to make
“French-German propositions” that will help “guarantee the
future of Europe.” The two heads of state are due to meet in
Paris at  1:30 p.m. tomorrow  for a “work lunch,” according to
the Elysee presidential palace’s website.  Sarkozy and Merkel have different opinions on several
matters including the role of the European Central Bank and the
closer monitoring of euro countries’ budgets with potential
sanctions against persistent offenders, Le Journal du Dimanche
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
