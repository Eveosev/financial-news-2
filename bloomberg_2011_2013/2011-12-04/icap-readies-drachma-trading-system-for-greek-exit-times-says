ICAP Plc (IAP)  has set up a drachma-trading
platform in anticipation of Greece leaving the euro, the Sunday
Times reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer
 Michael Spencer .  The interdealer broker is preparing and testing the
foreign-exchange system, which would allow banks to make trades
on the day a new currency is issued, the newspaper said.
Greeceâ€™s long-term future is better suited being outside the
euro, the Sunday Times cited Spencer as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
