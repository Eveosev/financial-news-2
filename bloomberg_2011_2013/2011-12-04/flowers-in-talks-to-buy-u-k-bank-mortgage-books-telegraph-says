JC Flowers & Co., the U.S. private-
equity firm, is in talks with several U.K. banks about buying
their mortgage books after failing to purchase Northern Rock
Plc, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  JC Flowers set aside 1.5 billion pounds ($2.34 billion) for
mortgage book acquisitions, the newspaper reported. The assets
will be transferred to OneSavings Bank Plc as part of any deal,
according to the newspaper. A spokesman for the company declined
to comment, according to the Telegraph.  To contact the reporter on this story:
