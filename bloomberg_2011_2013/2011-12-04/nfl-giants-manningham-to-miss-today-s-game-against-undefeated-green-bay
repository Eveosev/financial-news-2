New York Giants wide receiver  Mario
Manningham  won’t play in today’s game against the Green Bay

who will miss the game with a headache. Running back  Ahmad
Bradshaw , who recovered from a broken bone in his foot, will
play, the team said.  Manningham has 34 catches for 404 yards and three
touchdowns.  The Packers are 11-0; the Giants are 6-5.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
