(Corrects story published Dec. 4 to remove reference to
falling crude  oil prices  in third paragraph.)  The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations fell 8.89 cents to $3.2918 a
gallon, according to Lundberg Survey Inc. of Camarillo,
 California .  The price covers the two-week period ended Dec. 2 and is
derived from the company’s survey of about 2,500 retail stations
nationwide.  “Poor gasoline demand caused by severe unemployment has
produced this price drop at the pump,” said  Trilby Lundberg ,
president of Lundberg Survey.  Crude prices may decline this week on speculation that the
economic recovery isn’t strong enough to sustain oil prices at
the $100-a-barrel level, a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Eleven of 24 analysts, or 46 percent, forecast oil will
decline through Dec. 9. Nine respondents, or 38 percent,
predicted a gain and four estimated there will be little change.
Last week, 57 percent of surveyed analysts projected a drop.  Crude oil  supplies  rose 3.93 million barrels to 334.7
million in the week ended Nov. 25, department data showed.
 Inventories  at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for New
York-traded West Texas Intermediate oil, fell 2.2 percent to
31.3 million barrels.  Gasoline for January delivery on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange rose 13.78 cents, or 5.6 percent, to $2.6162 a gallon
in the two weeks ended Dec. 2. That’s the highest settlement
since Nov. 16.  Stockpiles Rise  U.S.  gasoline stockpiles  rose 213,000 barrels in the week
ended Nov. 25 to 209.8 million, the highest level in eight
weeks, according to Energy Department data. Deliveries to
wholesalers, measured on a  four-week average , were 2.9 percent
below a year earlier.  Demand at the pump in the seven days through Nov. 25 rose 3
percent from the prior week, boosted by the Thanksgiving
holiday, according to MasterCard Inc.’s SpendingPulse report.
Consumption fell short of year-earlier levels an 13th straight
time, sliding 3.8 percent. Averaged over four weeks, demand fell
4.1 percent, the 36th consecutive decline in that measure.  Oil futures rose $3.55, or 3.6 percent, in the two weeks
ended Dec. 2 to settle at $100.96 on the exchange.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline averaged $3.58 a gallon,
Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations averaged $3.63 a
gallon.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among the
cities surveyed on Dec. 2 was in  San Francisco , where prices
averaged $3.67 a gallon. The lowest price was in  Albuquerque ,
where a gallon averaged $2.84, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
