Gasoline spilled from a pipeline
operated by  Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (HEP)  in  Texas , according to a
filing with the  National Response Center .  Five barrels of gasoline leaked from the pipeline due to
“external corrosion” on Dec. 2, it said.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
