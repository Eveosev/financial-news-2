Yale University ’s Richard C. Levin
was the Ivy League’s highest-paid president at $1.63 million in
total compensation in 2009, as 36 private-college leaders
received more than $1 million each.  Six more chief executives than in the previous year earned
more than $1 million, according to the Chronicle of Higher
Education. The journal, based in  Washington , yesterday published
a study of pay for 519 leaders at 482 private colleges in the
U.S. in 2009, the latest year with available data.  The median compensation for presidents at the 50
institutions with the largest budgets rose 75 percent in a
decade to $876,792 in 2009. At colleges and universities with
budgets of more than $50 million, such compensation increased
2.2 percent in 12 months.  “To the extent that most of these compensation packages
are contractually set up, the increases that presidents
experience are in many ways impervious to economic conditions,”
Jack Stripling, a Chronicle reporter, said in an interview.  Levin of Yale, in  New Haven , Connecticut, got 6.4 percent
more than in 2008. Levin, 64, is the longest-serving president
in the Ivy League of eight selective institutions in the
northeastern U.S. An economist, he has led Yale since 1993.
Yale’s endowment, totaling $16.7 billion on June 30, makes it
the second-richest of the schools, after  Harvard University  in
Cambridge,  Massachusetts .  None of the top four earners in 2009 are still in office.
Constantine N. Papadakis of Drexel University in Philadelphia,
who died in April 2009, earned the most that year, $4.91
million. The majority of his earnings came from life insurance
and accrued compensation paid to his wife.  Johns Hopkins  The next-highest compensated was William R. Brody, then
president of  Johns Hopkins  University in Baltimore, with $3.82
million. Donald V. DeRosa, then head of the University of the
Pacific in Stockton,  California , got $2.36 million. Henry S. Bienen, who was president of Northwestern University in
Evanston,  Illinois , received $2.24 million.  Among the eight Ivy League presidents, half received less
compensation in 2009 than in the previous year, according to the
Chronicle’s analysis.  The total compensation of Lee C. Bollinger of  Columbia
University  in New York was $1.53 million, a decrease of 13
percent. Amy Gutmann of the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia earned $1.32 million, a 3.4 percent decline. David Skorton of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, received
$862,000, a 5.9 percent drop. Ruth Simmons of  Brown University 
in Providence, Rhode Island, got $657,000, down 26 percent.  Faust’s Pay  Among the gainers, Drew Faust, president of Harvard,
received $875,000, a 6.4 percent increase. Shirley Tilghman of
Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, collected
$911,000, up 3.4 percent.  In his first year at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New
Hampshire, Jim Yong Kim received $613,000.  The Chronicle analyzed the most recently available federal
tax returns, which are made public when filers are not-for-
profit institutions, as is the case with most colleges and
universities. Total compensation for the executives may include
benefits such as housing and deferred pay.  As colleges pay leaders more, one way that the institutions
obtain money needed to operate is by raising prices paid by
students and their families.  President Barack Obama plans to hold a meeting with several
college presidents today to discuss affordability in higher
education, according to a statement from the White House.  Tuition and fees at public universities in the U.S.
increased 8.3 percent this year, twice the rate of inflation, to
an average $8,244, while costs at nonprofit, private colleges
rose 4.5 percent to $28,500, the College Board, a New York-based
nonprofit, said in an October report. Surging tuition has left
the average college graduate with more than $20,000 in loans,
according to the research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
