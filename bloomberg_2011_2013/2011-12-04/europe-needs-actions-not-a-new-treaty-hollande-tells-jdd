Europe needs “immediate actions,”
not a new treaty,  Francois Hollande , the Socialist Party
candidate for France’s 2012 presidential elections, told  Le
Journal du Dimanche .  Negotiations for a new EU treaty would take “months,”
the French newspaper cited Hollande as saying in an interview
published today.  Confidence would be restored quickly if certain measures
were taken, for example if the  European Central Bank  become
“more flexible” and the European Financial Stability Facility
became a “bank” that supported the most vulnerable countries,
Hollande told JDD.  To contact the reporter on this story:
