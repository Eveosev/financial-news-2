Britain’s deteriorating economic
outlook has made the need to overhaul public-sector pensions
more urgent, according to the former minister who carried out a
review of the system for Prime Minister  David Cameron .  “Change is going to be the order of the day,” John Hutton, who was a pensions minister in  Tony Blair ’s Labour
government, said in an interview broadcast on  BBC  Radio 4 today.  Thousands of public-sector workers staged a one-day strike
on Nov. 30 over plans to make them pay more toward their
pensions, retire later and accept a pension based on a “career
average” salary rather than their final salary.  The proposals formed the basis of Hutton’s review of the
system, concluded in March. Cameron’s Conservative-led coalition
government says the move, part of a program of spending cuts to
narrow the  budget deficit , is fair because state workers get
pension benefits no longer available to their private-sector
equivalents.  Hutton’s comments come after the  Office for Budget
Responsibility  last week cut its U.K. forecasts and said the
2008 financial crisis and recession had inflicted more damage
than previously thought, limiting the economy’s growth
potential.  “That’s going to affect the sustainability of public
sector pensions in a negative way,” Hutton told the BBC. “We
could be heading for the rocks unless we make adjustment now.”  He described the government proposals as “credible” and
urged ministers and unions to reach an agreement quickly.  To contact the reporter on this story:
