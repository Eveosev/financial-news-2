Dev Anand , the Bollywood actor
compared with Hollywood star Gregory Peck, has died.  Anand, who was 88, died in  London  yesterday from cardiac
arrest, the  Press Trust of India  reported today.  He earned the sobriquet of India’s Gregory Peck courtesy of
the Washington Post decades ago, according to Mid Day newspaper.
Anand made his movie debut with ‘Hum Ek Hain’ in 1946 and went
on to act in more than 100 films, with his latest production,
 ‘Chargesheet’ , released on Sept. 30.  “An era has come to an end,” actor Amitabh Bachchan wrote
on his Twitter Inc. feed. “Dev Anand leaves a void never
perhaps to be filled again,” he wrote.  Anand founded his own production company,  Navketan Films 
that made its first film ‘Baazi’ in 1951. He acted in movies
including hits such as ‘Ziddi’, ‘Paying Guest’, ‘Kaala Paani’,
‘Hum Dono’, ‘Johnny Mera Naam’, ‘Guide’ and ‘Hare Rama Hare
Krishna’.  ‘Baazi’ was selected as  India ’s entry for the Berlin
International Film Festival, while the English version of
‘Guide’ that Anand co-produced with Pearl S. Buck, the late
American Nobel Laureate, was India’s entry for the Academy
Awards in 1964, according to the Navketanfilms.com website.  Anand received the Padma Bhushan award, one of the highest
civilian honors conferred by the Indian government, in 2001.  To contact the reporter on this story:
