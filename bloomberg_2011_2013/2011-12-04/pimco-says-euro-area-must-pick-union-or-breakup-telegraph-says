European leaders need to rapidly
agree a fiscal union or partial breakup to avoid slumping demand
for their debt,  Andrew Balls , regional investment chief for
Pacific Investment Management Co., told the Sunday Telegraph.  The world’s biggest bond investor said the euro region must
signal its position or suffer from “continued disengagement by
investors,” the newspaper reported. European Union leaders meet
on Dec. 9 in Brussels to address the regional debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
