(Corrects the name of OAS in headline. Story originally ran
on Dec. 4)  Brazil  hasn’t paid membership fees to
the Organization of American States since April amid a
disagreement over a hydroelectric dam in the Amazon, the O
Estado de S. Paulo newspaper reported, without saying where it
got the information.  The OAS’s Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asked
Brazil to immediately suspend work on the Belo Monte dam project
until it adequately consults indigenous people in the area, the
OAS said in a statement on April 5.  The OAS press office and President Dilma Rousseff’s press
office didn’t immediately return phone calls from Bloomberg News
seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
