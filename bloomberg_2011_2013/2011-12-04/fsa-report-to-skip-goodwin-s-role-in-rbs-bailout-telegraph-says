The roles of  Fred Goodwin , former
chief executive officer of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , and
Tom McKillop, its former chairman, will not be examined in a
review of RBS’s bailout, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  The Financial Service Authority’s report will focus instead
on Johnny Cameron, the company’s former head of investment
banking, the newspaper said, citing a source with knowledge of
the matter. The FSA is likely to blame the bank’s collapse on
the global financial crisis and its purchase of ABN Amro Holding
NV, according to the Telegraph. The FSA will also review its own
role, the report said.  Edinburgh-based RBS posted the biggest loss in corporate
history in 2008 and required the largest bank bailout in the
world after the bank’s 73.3 billion-euro ($101 billion)
acquisition of  ABN Amro .  To contact the reporter on this story:
