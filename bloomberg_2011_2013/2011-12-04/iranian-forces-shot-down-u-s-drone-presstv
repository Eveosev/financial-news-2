Iran ’s military shot down a U.S.
reconnaissance drone in the country’s east, PressTV reported,
citing an unidentified military official.  The unmanned RQ-170 Sentinel aircraft suffered minimal
damage in the attack, the state-run Iranian television station
said. The  Lockheed Martin Corp RQ-170  is a stealth drone.  White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said he had no immediate
comment on the report.  Tensions with Iran have increased since the U.S. called for
new trade sanctions in the wake of a report by United Nations
atomic energy inspectors. The Nov. 8 report drew on “credible”
intelligence to argue that Iran’s efforts to build a nuclear
bomb “may be ongoing.”  Iran, holder of the world’s second-largest oil reserves,
sits on one side of the  Strait of Hormuz  in the Persian Gulf,
through which an estimated 25 percent of the world’s oil traffic
flows.  To contact the reporters on this story:
