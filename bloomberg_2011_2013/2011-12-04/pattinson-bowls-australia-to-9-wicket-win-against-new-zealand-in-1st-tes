James Pattinson was named as man of
the match on his debut as  Australia  dismissed New Zealand for
150 today to win the first cricket Test in Brisbane by nine
wickets  The 21-year-old took five second innings wickets to reduce
the tourists to 5-28, with Nathan Lyon then claiming three
dismissals as Australia completed its win. Australia chased down
a 19-run victory target for the loss of one wicket.  “It hasn’t sunk in yet,” Pattinson told reporters. “I’m
just happy to be able to do a job for the Australian cricket
team. It’s a great achievement personally, but it’s great for
the team as well.”  Pattinson, who had match figures of 6-91, claimed the
opening wicket last night. In only the second over today he took
three wickets in four balls to leave  New Zealand  reeling.   He was making his Test debut alongside batsman  David Warner 
and pace bowler Mitchell Starc.  The second and final Test starts in Hobart on Dec. 9.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
