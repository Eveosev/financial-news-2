Nigerian police stations and banks in
the northern town of Azare were attacked by gunmen, while two
people were killed in an assault on a wedding in Maiduguri city.  The raiders attacked the police headquarters in Azare and
branches of  Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY)  and  Intercontinental Bank
Plc (INTERCON)  were destroyed, said Alhaji Abdullahi, chairman of the local
government council. The groom was one of the two killed at the
wedding and another three were injured, Hassan Mohammed, a
spokesman for Nigeria’s Joint Task Force, said by phone.  Nigerian authorities say the Taliban-inspired Boko Haram is
behind a spate of attacks in the past year in  Africa ’s biggest
oil-producing nation, targeting security forces and the state.  The group, which is seeking to establish an Islamic state
in northern Nigeria, said it was behind an Aug. 26 suicide car
bomb that killed 23 people at a United Nations building in
Abuja, as well as attacks in Yobe and Borno states last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
