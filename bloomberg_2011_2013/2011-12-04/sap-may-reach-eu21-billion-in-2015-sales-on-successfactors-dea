SAP AG (SAP) , the largest maker of
business-management software, said the purchase of 
 SuccessFactors Inc. (SFSF)  may help it to reach sales of 21 billion
euros in 2015.   The deal could add as much as 1 billion euros to sales in
2015, co-Chief Executive Officer  Bill McDermott  said in a
telephone interview today. Before the SuccessFactors deal,
announced yesterday, SAP had targeted sales of 20 billion euros
in 2015.   “We envision that SuccessFactors will be on top of the 20
billion euros,” McDermott said today. “Could it be an extra
billion? Absolutely. Without a doubt.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
