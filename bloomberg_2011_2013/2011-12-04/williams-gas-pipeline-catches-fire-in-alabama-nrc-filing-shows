Fire erupted at a natural-gas
pipeline operated by Williams Gas Pipeline near Myrtle Wood,
 Alabama , a filing with the  National Response Center  shows.  The “line has been isolated and” is “in process of being
secured,” according to the  filing  on the Dec. 3 incident.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
