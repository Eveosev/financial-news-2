A car-rental plan in Paris, modeled
on the cityâ€™s bike-sharing program, starts tomorrow,  Le Journal
du Dimanche  reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  About 3,000 electric cars are expected to be available
across the city by mid-2012, the  BFM television channel  also
reported today. Clients will pay 10 euros ($13.39) a month to
subscribe to the service, with the cost of each car rental then
depending on how long it lasts, BFM TV said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
