Mehmet Berk, an Istanbul prosecutor,
sought jail terms for officials of eight Turkish soccer clubs,
including last seasonâ€™s league champion  Fenerbahce (FENER) , cup winner
 Besiktas (BJKAS)  and Trabzonspor, in an alleged match-fixing probe,
 Haberturk  reported, citing Deputy Prosecutor Fikret Secen.  A 400-page indictment, prepared by a group of prosecutors
led by Berk, was sent to an Istanbul court yesterday, Secen
said, according to the newspaper. The court will decide in two
weeks whether to go ahead with the case, he said.  Prosecutors are seeking jail terms for 93 club executives,
coaches, footballers, journalists and former officials, 31 of
whom are already in jail, as part of the probe of Turkish
soccer, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
