England’s  Lee Westwood  retained his
Nedbank Golf Challenge title, beating Sweden’s  Robert Karlsson 
by two shots, to claim a $1.25 million prize. Rory McIlroy won
the Hong Kong Open.  Westwood, No. 3 in the Official World Golf Ranking, was
only able to card a 1-over-par 73 in his final round in Sun City
today, but had started the day with a seven-shot lead over
Karlsson and Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland after a 62
yesterday.  McDowell tied for third at the Gary Player Country Club
with Jason Dufner of the U.S. on 11-under, four shots adrift of
the 38-year-old Westwood.  The 12-player invitational event also included world No. 1
Luke Donald of England and  Northern Ireland ’s Darren Clarke,
winner of the British Open in July.  Clarke’s countryman McIlroy won his third event on golf’s
European Tour, with a two-shot victory at the Hong Kong Open in
Fanling. Gregory Havret of France was second, with Sweden’s
Peter Hanson another shot back.  McIlroy, 22, who is second in the world rankings, has
finished in the top 10 in 12 of his 18 European Tour events this
year, including victory at the U.S. Open Championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
