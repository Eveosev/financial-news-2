Taiwan’s dollar rose to the strongest
level in almost two weeks on optimism central banks in the
world’s biggest economies will ease monetary policy, helping
support the island’s exports.  Government bonds  gained.  The time is ripe for China’s central bank to lower banks’
reserve ratios, China Securities Journal said today. The
 European Central Bank  will cut its benchmark  interest rate 
by at least a quarter of a percentage point at its July 5
meeting, according to 51 of 62 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  “A rate cut by the ECB would support a rally across
Taiwan’s asset classes,” said  Albert Lee , a Taipei-based fixed-
income trader at Cathay United Bank Co. “But the effect may
fizzle in a day or two. The ECB hasn’t been able to inject much
concrete optimism into the market lately.”  The currency gained 0.1 percent to NT$29.88 against its
U.S. counterpart as of 9:58 a.m. local time, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.78, the strongest level since June
21. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was steady at 3.90 percent.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 fell one
basis point to 1.22 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady at 0.506
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the  Taiwan 
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
