France  had a rainy and relatively
cool June in the country’s northern half, while the south was
warm and dry, forecaster Meteo-France reported.  While Marseille on the Mediterranean had 342 sunny hours in
June, the Paris region and Brittany saw the sun for 100 to 140
hours, between 50 percent and 70 percent of normal values for
the month, Meteo-France wrote in an online  report  yesterday.  Corsica got 15 percent of normal rainfall last month, and
the Ile-de-France region around the country’s capital received
105 millimeters (4.13 inches), almost double the normal amount
for June and the most since 1997, according to the report.  “The country is cut in two, with temperatures that are
cool for the season in the northern half,” Meteo-France wrote.
“A large south-eastern quarter of France benefited from average
temperatures that exceeded normal by more than 1 degree Celsius
(1.8 degrees Fahrenheit).”  To contact the reporter on this story:
