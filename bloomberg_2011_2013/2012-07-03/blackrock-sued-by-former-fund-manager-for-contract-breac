Former  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  fund manager
Michael Lipsky sued his former employer, the world’s largest
asset manager, claiming it wrongfully withheld information he
was promised under his employment contract.  Lipsky, who resigned from the New York-based company in
December 2010, accused BlackRock of refusing to provide him
“full, complete and accurate information” about the investment
results for funds he managed during his employment. The suit was
filed today in  New York  State Supreme Court in Manhattan.  “In fact, instead of acting in good faith, BlackRock
’dumped’ on Lipsky irrelevant and indecipherable data it knew
was worthless and could not possibly be used to validate to
investors Lipsky’s strong history of success with respect to the
funds he managed,” according to the complaint.  Brian Beades , a spokesman for BlackRock, didn’t immediately
reply to a message left seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Michael Lipsky v. Blackrock Inc., 652329/2012,
New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
