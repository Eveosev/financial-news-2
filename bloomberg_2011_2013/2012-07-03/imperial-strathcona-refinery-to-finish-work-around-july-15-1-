Imperial Oil Ltd. (IMO)  expects to finish a
maintenance turnaround at the Strathcona refinery near Edmonton,
Alberta, around July 15, a company spokesman said.  The turnaround is scheduled to be completed in mid-July,
and process units that were shut as part of the work will return
to service sequentially after the maintenance is finished, Pius Rolheiser, a company spokesman, said by telephone. The company
had initially hoped to finish by the end of June, he said.  “Frankly, you can estimate a time, but this work takes as
long as it takes to complete,” said Rolheiser, who is based at
the company’s headquarters in Calgary. “Our focus is completing
it safely and effectively.”  Imperial, a unit of Irving, Texas-based  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,
produces  aviation fuel , gasoline and diesel at the 187,000-
barrel-a-day Strathcona refinery. The plant processes Canadian
crude, while Imperial’s Dartmouth, Sarnia and Nanticoke
refineries use Canadian and foreign crudes, the company said in
a 10-K filing Dec. 31.  The Strathona refinery shut a crude unit, catalytic cracker
and alkylation unit as part of the turnaround, a person with
direct knowledge of the work said June 21.  A “small fire” that broke out at the refinery June 28
didn’t affect the turnaround schedule, Pius said. The company is
still investigating the cause of the blaze, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
