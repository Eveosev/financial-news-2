Kit Digital Inc. (KITD) , a maker of online-
video software, fell for a second day after saying it expects to
record a loss on the sale of its content business.  The stock retreated as much as 3.6 percent and last traded
1.4 percent lower at 88 koruna by the end of trading in Prague.  Kit sold its unit to Content Solutions International NV in
an $18.8 million deal, the company said in a statement late
yesterday. The company “expects to book a loss” on the sale,
and said the size is dependent on accounting and calculations
that aren’t currently complete, Kit said in a separate
regulatory filing.  “The sale of non-core assets was mentioned during the
first-quarter results and it should not be a surprise,”
analysts led by Milan Vanicek at J&T Banka AS in Prague said in
an e-mailed note. “However, booking an unspecified loss might
cause a negative market reaction. We consider the news
negative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
