Prime Minister  David Cameron  said the
U.K. is ready to close its borders to migrants should a crisis
among countries using the euro lead to a rush of migrants.  “We obviously have contingency plans for all sorts of
eventualities,” the prime minister told a committee of
lawmakers in a question-and-answer session today. “The legal
position is that if there are extraordinary stresses and
strains, it is possible to take action to restrict migratory
flows.”  Cameron added that while “obviously we hope that doesn’t
happen,” he “would be prepared to do what it takes.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
