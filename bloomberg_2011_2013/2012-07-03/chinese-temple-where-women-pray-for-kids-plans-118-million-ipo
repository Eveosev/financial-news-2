The managers of Putuo Mountain, a
Buddhist shrine where worshippers go to pray for healthy
children, want to raise 750 million  yuan  ($118 million) in an
initial public offering,  China Daily  reported today.  The Putuo Mountain Tourism Development Co., in the eastern
province of Zhejiang, plans to seek the listing after “prudent
considerations and a year of preparation,” the newspaper said,
citing an official with the site’s management committee.  Plans for the offering by one of China’s four main  Buddhist
mountains  come as China’s State Administration for Religious
Affairs has criticized local governments for seeking to turn a
profit off religious sites.  “Developing the economy should have its limits and should
not cross the moral lines,” the official Xinhua News Agency
cited Liu Wei, an official with China’s State Administration for
Religious Affairs, as saying in June. The article highlighted
official opposition to listing temples.  Chinese media reported in 2009 that officials in Henan
Province planned to list Shaolin temple, the Chinese Buddhist
monastery considered the birthplace of kung fu. Local leaders
later denied the claim.  Emei Shan Tourism Co. (000888) , which oversees
Emei Mountain, another main Buddhist shrine, went public in
Shenzhen in 1997. Its stock has risen 18.4 percent this year.  Chinese law prohibits state-owned protected historical
sites from becoming business assets, China Daily said today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
