Western Canada Select’s discount to
West Texas Intermediate widened to the largest margin in more
than three months before planned work at BP Plc’s Whiting
refinery in  Indiana .  The 420,000-barrel-a-day plant will shut equipment
including crude unit 11A on Aug. 3 for 30 days of planned work,
a person with knowledge of the plans said April 19.  Western Canada Select’s discount widened $3 to $30 a barrel
below WTI at 11:41 a.m. in  New York , according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That’s the cheapest the grade has traded at since
March 22.  Syncrude’s discount widened 25 cents to $5.50 below WTI.
Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in
 Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $10 below the U.S.
benchmark. The grade’s margin narrowed $4 yesterday after the
 Carlyle Group , a private-equity firm that’s taking over
operations at Sunoco Inc.’s Philadelphia refinery, said the
plant will process oil delivered by rail from  North Dakota ’s
Bakken formation.  On the U.S. Gulf Coast, Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
WTI widened 90 cents to $14 a barrel. Light Louisiana Sweet’s
premium added 65 cents to $12.90 a barrel.  Poseidon’s premium to WTI increased 25 cents to $8 a
barrel. Southern Green Canyon’s premium increased 25 cents a
barrel to $7.50. Mars Blend added 35 cents to $9.10 a barrel
over WTI.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 20 cents to
$11 a barrel over WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
