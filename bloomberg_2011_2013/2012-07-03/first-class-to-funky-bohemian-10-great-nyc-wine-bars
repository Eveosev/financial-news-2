Wine bars are trendy now, so beware
-- lots of dowdy bar-and-grills, frat-boy beer joints and third-
rate bistros are adding a few commercial wines by the glass and
rebranding themselves as the real deal.  To qualify as a bona fide wine bar, the primary focus has
to be on the grape: If the predominant bottles are vodka, it’s
not a wine bar.  The purveyors should also have a spot of erudition,
insight, maybe even passion. For Morrell’s wine director Jean
Reilly, the bartenders are all-important: “They should be able
to engage and speak knowledgeably about wine in a way that puts
the customer at ease.”  Every wine bar serves a cheese and charcuterie plate, but
some go to the trouble of seeking out more flavorful, artisanal
varieties, and that’s always a good portent for the quality of
the wine.  Here are ten of my New York City favorites, serving great
-- and interesting -- wine with flair and expertise.  Anfora  Dim lights and horseshoe-shaped banquettes impart the feel
of a hip cocktail lounge. Though the drinks are impressive, the
main business here is wine.  And good food, too -- don’t pass on the fine selection of
cheeses. And I especially liked the hand-cranked prosciutto
slicer.  Recommended: Riesling, Gunther Steinmetz 2010, Mosel,
 Germany .  At 34 8th Ave. and Jane St. Information: +1-212.518.2722;

claustrophobic tunnel into a large and ultra-modern space.  Have a plate of tramezzini, three-layered finger sandwiches
made with Sicilian tuna or eggplant with olive paste.  In case you miss the Italian connection, three vintage
Vespas are on display.  Recommended: Barolo Parusso 2007, Piemonte, Italy.  At 175 2nd Avenue, between 11th and 12th Streets.
Information: +1-212.260.3200;  http://www.barveloce.com .  Bin 71  There is a television, but when I was there, the sound was
off, and the ambient music was turned low enough for non-
screaming chat.  The three-sided, marble-topped bar and two rectangular
communal tables were occupied by good-looking 20-and 30-year-old
professionals, perusing the well-thought-out, international wine
list.  Feast on Serrano ham, Malpeque oysters, pink-snapper
sashimi and polenta baked with  Vermont ’s pungent Bayley Hazen
blue.  Recommended: Arneis Roero, Bruno Giacosa 2007, Piemonte,
Italy.  At 237 Columbus Ave. and 71st St. Information: +1-212-362-
5446;  http://bin71.com .  Buceo 95  The winning tapas just kept coming at this charming bar:
pungent olives, super-fresh grilled calamari, tomato toast,
spicy meatballs and Spanish garlic shrimp.  All were washed down with a succession of extremely well-
chosen wines, mainly from  Spain  and  South America .  Recommended: Tempranillo Blend, Bodegas Olabarri 2001,
Rioja Gran Reserva, Spain.  At 201 West 95th St., near Amsterdam Ave. Information: +1-
212-662-7010;  http://www.buceo95.com .  Enoteca I Trulli  With its simple but elegant marble bar and scrubbed-pine
tables, this is one of the most unostentatiously attractive wine
bars in the city. Plus the garden is now open for the summer.  A wide selection of unusual Italian wines, above-average
panini and panzerotti and the relaxed professionalism of its
staff create the sense that you’re in an upscale Roman enoteca.  Recommended: Arialdo Sangiovese 2009, Dalle Nostre Mani,
Toscana,  Italy . The thoughtfully constructed flights are also
worth attention.  At 122 E. 27th St. near Lexington Ave. Information: +1-212-
481-7372;  http://www.itrulli.com .  Epistrophy Cafe  There’s a relaxed Bohemian vibe here, imparted by the
scuffed wooden bar, exposed brick walls and eclectic, junk-shop
collection of sofas, chairs and tables.  The food and wine are predominantly Sardinian: the sformato
di zucchini was a revelation and the Tagliere di Terra, a plate
of cheese and cold cuts, a meal in itself.  Recommended: Cannonau di Sardegna, Terreforru, Meloni Vini
2007, Italy.  At 200 Mott St. Information: +1-212-966-0904;
 http://www.epistrophycafe.com .  Kaia Wine Bar  Friendly service, an imaginative list of South African
wines -- kaia means “hut” in  South Africa  -- and splendid food
make up for the concrete floor, unadorned gray walls and
metallic bar.  Ever tried Buffel Frikadelle, or bison meatballs with gravy
and celery root puree? Inside tip: avoid the Pinotage.  Recommended: Chardonnay Pinot Noir, Haute Cabriere 2010,
Franschhoek, South Africa. And, no, that’s not a typo -- it
really is a Chard/PN blend, and it’s white.  At 1614 3rd Avenue between 90th and 91st Streets.
Information: +1-212-722-0490;  http://kaiawinebar.com .  Kashkaval  Peer through the storefront window and you might assume
Kashkaval was just a boutique-sized Mediterranean deli. Squeeze
past the display of cheese and olives, and you find yourself in
a packed, tiny wine bar infused with the happy buzz of people
consuming good food and wine.  A variety of cheeses from 14 different countries and an
enormous bowl of the best hummus I have ever tasted are the
stars here.  Recommended: Chenin Blanc/Viognier, Pine Ridge 2010, Napa,
 California .  At 856 Ninth Ave., near 56th St. Information: +1-212-581-
8282;  http://www.kashkavalfoods.com .  Morrell’s Wine Bar & Cafe  As befits its tony location overlooking Rockefeller Center,
Morrell’s is the ultimate in wine bar sophistication.  If you appreciate the difference between Burgundy and
Brunello, you’ll fare well at this chic boite. If you don’t, the
friendly, well-informed staff will be happy to guide you through
their pricy offerings.  The menu alone is worth a visit as it’s hard to do better
in the neighborhood. Try the deviled eggs with black truffle.  Recommended: Cotes du Rhone, Delas Freres, St. Esprit 2009,
Rhone,  France .  At 1 Rockefeller Center, 49th Street between 5th and 6th
Avenues. Information: +1-212-262-7700;
 http://morrellwinebar.com .  The Tangled Vine  What’s not to love about the Tangled Vine? They have a
commendable selection of hidden gems, unusual bin-end lots and
small production European wines to tempt the enthusiast and
curious amateur alike.  Combine this with an easygoing, knowledgeable staff and
fantastic food and you get pretty close to my ideal wine bar.
Especially alluring are the broccoli rabe, quail egg and
Parmesan crostini.  Recommended: Rosso di Montalcino, La Rasina 2008, Toscana,
Italy.  At 434 Amsterdam Ave. and 81st St. Information: +1-
