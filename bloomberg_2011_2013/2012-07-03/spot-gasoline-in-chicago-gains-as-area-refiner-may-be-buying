Chicago gasoline traded at a premium
to futures for the first time since June 14 amid speculation
that one of the five main refineries in the area may have been
buying on the  spot market .  Gasoline also gained in New York Harbor and the  Gulf Coast 
on the likelihood of fewer sellers the day before the U.S. July
4 holiday.  “Chicago is stronger today and one of the refiners is
probably buying,” said Jim Mosby, supply manager at ADMO Energy
LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas City , Kansas. “And every
market is thin before the holiday. Whereas it might usually take
a few thousand orders to move the market a penny or more, today
it might take only a couple of hundred.”  Conventional, 87-grade gasoline in Chicago gained 4 cents
to a 2.5-cent premium to futures traded on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 12:48 p.m., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The major oil refineries serving the Chicago market are BP
Plc’s Whiting, Indiana, plant; the Phillips 66 refinery in
Roxana, Illinois; Exxon Mobil Corp.’s Joliet, Illinois, plant;
Citgo Petroleum Corp.’s Lemont, Illinois, facility; and Marathon
Petroleum Corp’s Robinson, Illinois, refinery.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.38 cents to 10 cents a gallon.  That’s the
smallest difference since June 25.  In  New York  Harbor, the discount for that grade narrowed
2.88 cents to 2.25 cents, the smallest discount since June 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
