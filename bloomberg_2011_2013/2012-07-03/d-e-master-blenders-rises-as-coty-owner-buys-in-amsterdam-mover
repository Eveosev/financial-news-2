D.E Master Blenders 1753 NV jumped
the most since last month’s spinoff from Sara Lee Corp. in
Amsterdam trading after a company linked to the owner of Coty
Inc. purchased a stake in the tea and coffee maker.  The acquisition of the 12.19 percent stake by Donata
Holding SE “is like a rabbit out of the hat for the markets,”
 Marco Gulpers , an Amsterdam-based analyst for ING Groep NV, said
in a note to investors today. Donata holds the shares through
units of JAB Holdings, a subsidiary of the company that controls
Coty and owns a stake in  Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc. (RB/)   JAB may increase its stake, though the  investment company 
plans to remain a minority investor, a spokeswoman for JAB said.  “Maybe we will buy more shares, but there’s no timeframe
at this moment,” Elke Neujahr said in a telephone interview.  D.E Master Blenders, trading on an “as-if-and-when-
issued/delivered” basis, rose 6.8 percent to 9.99 euros at the
close in Amsterdam, valuing the company at 5.94 billion euros
($7.5 billion). Settlement takes place from July 9, when the
stock will gain an official listing.  Donata held 72.5 million shares as of June 29, a filing
posted today by Dutch financial markets regulator AFM showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
