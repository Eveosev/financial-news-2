Iraq has started to issue import
licenses for traders that are meant to curb the smuggling of
hard currency, a Trade Ministry official said.  “The central bank will be able to recognize when it gives
hard-currency transfers to a certain shipment and this shipment
will be known to the central bank by its size, value and
origin,” Sadiq Hussein, director general of the ministry’s
Iraqi trade company for fairs and services, said at a press
conference in  Baghdad  today. “Therefore, there will be no way
to smuggle the currency.”  The government decided in April curtail the impact of the
impact of the dinar’s fluctuation on the economy. As part of the
initiative, the Central Bank of Iraq tightened controls over its
sales of U.S. dollars to prevent traders from buying to resell
on the black market in Iran and  Syria , which face hard-currency
shortages, Deputy Central Bank Governor Mudher Saleh said on
April 4.  International sanctions have cut government revenue and
access to foreign currency in Iran and Syria.  To contact the reporters on this story:
