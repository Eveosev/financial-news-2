The Turkish  air force  killed 25
members of the Kurdistan Workersâ€™ Party, or PKK, and wounded 23
in air strikes around Kandil mountain in northern  Iraq  on June
24, the armed forces in Ankara said in a statement on its
website late yesterday.  The PKK, which is classified as a terrorist organization by
Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union, has been fighting for
autonomy in largely Kurdish southeast Turkey for almost three
decades, in a conflict that has left some 40,000 people dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
