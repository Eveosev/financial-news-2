Following are comments on the effect
of U.S. sanctions against  Iran  from Jeanne Archibald, a partner
who leads the government regulatory practice group at law firm
 Hogan Lovells  in  Washington .  Twenty countries including China, Japan and India, Iran’s
three biggest customers, were exempted from U.S. sanctions that
took effect June 28. Under the law, banks in countries that
don’t reduce imports from Iran may lose access to the U.S.
financial system. Archibald, who formerly served as the U.S.
Treasury Department’s general counsel, spoke by phone today.  “One thing I’m seeing a lot of in my practice is
companies, including non-U.S. companies, simply deciding as a
business matter that they’re not going to do business that
touches Iran, or they’re going to be very careful about the kind
of business, or how much. We see many business people saying,
‘It’s just not worth the trouble I have to go to and the risk I
take.”’  To contact the reporter on this story:
