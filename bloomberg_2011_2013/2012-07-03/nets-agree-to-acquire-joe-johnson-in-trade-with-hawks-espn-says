The Brooklyn Nets have reached an
agreement with the Atlanta Hawks to acquire All-Star guard  Joe Johnson ,  ESPN reported , citing unidentified people briefed on
the discussions.  The Nets would send the expiring contracts of Jordan Farmar,
Johan Petro, Anthony Morrow and Jordan Williams to the Hawks
along with DeShawn Stevenson and a lottery-protected first-round
pick in the 2013 National Basketball Association draft, ESPN
said.  The arrival of 6-foot-7 guard Johnson, who averaged 18.8
points, 3.9 assists and 3.7 rebounds last season, may help
persuade free-agent point guard  Deron Williams  to re-sign with
Brooklyn. The Nets went 22-44 in their final year in New Jersey
last season.  The Hawks would rid themselves of a contract that would pay
31-year-old Johnson $90 million over the next four seasons,
clearing the way for new General Manager Danny Ferry to rebuild.
Atlanta went 40-26 last season before losing to Boston in the
first round of the playoffs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
