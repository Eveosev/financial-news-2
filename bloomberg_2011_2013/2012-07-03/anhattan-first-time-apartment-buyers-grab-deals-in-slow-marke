Manhattan home sales were dominated
by studios and one-bedroom apartments in the second quarter as
rising rents and low  mortgage rates  pushed first-time buyers
into an otherwise stagnant market.  Purchases of condominiums and co-ops totaled 2,647 in the
three months through June, little changed from a year earlier,
according to a report today by New York appraiser  Miller Samuel
Inc.  and brokerage  Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate . The
median price declined 2.5 percent to $829,000.  Studios and one-bedroom apartments accounted for 53 percent
of all deals, the second-highest share since the last three
months of 2009, when first-time purchasers qualified for a
federal tax credit of as much as $8,000, said  Jonathan Miller ,
president of Miller Samuel. The smaller units, favored by entry-
level buyers, accounted for 49 percent of all transactions a
year earlier.  “The ones that can qualify are clearly buying,” Miller
said. “They’re looking at rent versus buy and in more and more
cases, the math starts to work.”  The share of two-bedroom apartments, which reflects the so-
called trade-up market, declined to 32 percent from 38 percent
in the second quarter of 2011. Tight lending standards for jumbo
borrowers, combined with  home prices  still 19 percent below
their 2008 peak, are making it harder for homeowners to sell
their properties and upgrade to larger ones, Miller said.  StreetEasy Report  “With rates this low and prices off peak, we should be
having a housing boom right now, and we are clearly not,” he
said.  Among pending sales -- contracts signed but not completed
in the second quarter -- one-bedroom deals climbed 29 percent
from a year earlier, according to property-listings service
 StreetEasy.com , which also released a report on the Manhattan
market today.  The largest number of pending deals were in the $500,000 to
$1 million range, according to StreetEasy.  “Rents are just so high right now that for a lot of people
it doesn’t make sense” to continue leasing, said Sofia Song,
vice president of research at StreetEasy. “A lot of people are
saying, ‘You know what? For this amount of money I can probably
buy something.’”  In the first quarter, the median monthly rent for Manhattan
apartments jumped 7.1 percent from a year earlier to $3,100, or
$37,200 annually, according to Miller Samuel and Prudential.
Rents are now within about 5 percent of the $3,265 peak reached
at the end of 2006.  Price Cut  The average rate for a  30-year fixed  home loan was 3.66
percent, the lowest in records dating to 1971,  Freddie Mac  said
on June 28. The rate was less than 4 percent for the entire
second quarter, according to the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage
financier.  For Ed Garry, a year made all the difference in selling his
one-bedroom apartment in the Upper East Side’s Yorkville
section. He put the unit on the market in April 2011 with an
asking price of $695,000 and withdrew it seven months later when
he got no takers. In January, he tried again, cutting the price
to $649,000.  This time, Garry, 42, a Wall Street bank consultant, got
five offers for the 930-square-foot (86-square-meter) property
on  East 80th Street . He sold it in May for $621,000, according
to StreetEasy.  ‘Eager’ Buyers  “The mood seemed to be a little bit better than it has in
the last couple of years,” said Garry’s sales broker,  James
Ferrando  of Prudential Douglas Elliman. “The buyer mentality,
they’re eager to get out there and look and purchase.”  Garry, who bought the apartment in 2004 for $500,000, was
able to upgrade to a two-bedroom unit in  Harlem , where the
median price of a condo is almost a third of what it is on the
Upper East Side, according to brokerage  Corcoran Group . His
$890,968 deal was completed last month, New York City property
records show.  Low  interest rates  and tax abatements that encourage Harlem
home purchases made buying the bigger apartment “a no-
brainer,” he said.  “The combination of the two is what made it feasible in
the short term, and, in the long term, I think it’s going to be
a big investment,” Garry said.  Other reports issued today on the Manhattan apartment
market showed mixed results for sales and values in the second
quarter. Corcoran Group said purchases of condos and co-ops
totaled 3,650, the second-highest quarterly sales figure in two
years. The median price climbed 1 percent to $850,000.  Estimated Closings  StreetEasy  said the median price climbed 2.4 percent to
$840,000, while completed deals climbed 24 percent to 4,430. The
figure is an estimate that includes transfers recorded with the
the  New York  City Department of Finance by June 30, as well
transactions that were completed in June and are expected to be
recorded later, according to StreetEasy.  Brown Harris Stevens  and its sister brokerage,  Halstead
Property LLC , both reported a median price of $850,000, up 2
percent from the second quarter of 2011.  “People stopped worrying about the end of the world and
started focusing on the fundamentals,” said Gregory Heym, chief
economist at Terra Holdings LLC, which owns the two firms.
“There’s not a lot of supply. It’s not an investors’ market
like some parts of  Florida . People buy to live here.”  Inventory Declines  The inventory of apartments available to purchase declined
14 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier to 6,981
units, according to  Miller Samuel  and Prudential. About 376 new
listings came to market each week in the period, about 4.8
percent fewer than in the second quarter of 2011, StreetEasy
said.  Purchases of luxury apartments, defined as the top 10
percent of all sales by price, totaled 265 deals, unchanged from
a year earlier, Miller Samuel and Prudential said. The median
price of those transactions fell 10 percent to $4.08 million.  On the Upper East Side, the median price of previously
owned co-ops fell 9 percent from a year earlier to $770,000,
according to Corcoran. Condo prices in the neighborhood climbed
9 percent to a median $1.18 million. On the Upper West Side, the
median price of co-op resales dropped 2 percent to $775,000,
while condo resale prices climbed 36 percent to $1.29 million.  Co-op apartments in Upper Manhattan, which includes Harlem
and Morningside Heights, sold for a median $342,000 in the
quarter, up 10 percent from a year earlier, Corcoran said. Condo
prices declined 4 percent to $396,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
