Former U.S. Commerce Secretary  John Bryson  won’t face charges over a pair of traffic accidents on
June 9, when he struck two cars in San Gabriel, California,
after suffering a seizure.  The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office declined
to file a case, Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the office,
said today in an e-mailed statement. There wasn’t enough
evidence to prove that Bryson knowingly failed to provide
personal information for hit-and-run charges, according to a
document provided by the prosecutor’s office.  Blood tests showed Bryson had taken Ambien, a sleeping
drug, at the “low end of therapeutic levels,” according to the
district attorney’s evaluation. Investigators couldn’t say
whether that was a factor in the collisions and there was
insufficient evidence to charge Bryson with driving under the
influence, according to the evaluation.  Bryson, 68, resigned as Commerce Secretary less than two
weeks after the accidents. He was found unconscious behind the
wheel of his  Lexus  after the second of two collisions and was
treated for a seizure the same day. Bryson drove off after
striking the first car and hit the second car shortly afterward.
No serious injuries were reported.  Bryson, the former chief executive officer of  Edison
International (EIX) , said in his resignation letter to President
 Barack Obama  that the seizure he suffered June 9 could be a
distraction from his performance as secretary.  Jen Friedman, a Commerce Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on the district attorney’s decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
