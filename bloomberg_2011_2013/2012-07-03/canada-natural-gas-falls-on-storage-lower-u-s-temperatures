Canadian natural gas fell from the
highest price in more than a month as storage increases and cool
weather in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast signaled reduced
demand from  power plants  for fuel to run air conditioners.  August gas in  Alberta  declined 0.2 percent as  inventories 
in  Canada  rose 1.3 percent to 590.25 billion cubic feet for the
week ended June 22, according to Canadian Enerdata Ltd. States
from New Mexico to Maine were expected to have temperatures as
much as 3 degrees Fahrenheit (2 Celsius) lower than normal from
July 8 to July 12, according to MDA EarthSat Weather of
Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The market “is being swayed more from the supply side; you
have a whole lot of gas in storage up there,” Eric Bickel, an
analyst at Summit Energy Services in Louisville,  Kentucky , said
in a telephone interview.  Alberta gas for August delivery decreased 0.5 cent to
C$2.21 per gigajoule ($2.07 per million British thermal units)
as of 4 p.m. New York time on NGX, a Canadian Internet market.
Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada and the
U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Alberta gas has fallen 14 percent this year, from C$2.58 on
Dec. 31, and advanced 36 percent from C$1.625 at the end of
March.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 7.5 cents to settle at $2.899 per million Btu.  Weather Impact  “The above-normal heat we’re seeing right now across most
of the U.S. is really affecting that Nymex market,” Bickel
said.  Cooling weather in the upper Midwest and Northeast July 8
to July 12 “could include a day or two” of below-normal
temperatures, “though only of the marginal variety,” Travis Hartman, a meteorologist with MDA EarthSat, said today in a note
to clients.  The high in Chicago on July 12 may be 74 degrees, 11 below
normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
Pennsylvania.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago surged
10.32 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.8774 per million Btu on the
 Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can
carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas rose 2.62 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.4547 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices advanced 3.81 cents, or 1.5 percent,
to $2.6439.  Gas Flow  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 17.1 billion cubic
feet at 4 p.m.  New York  time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 1.92 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 2.01 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 778 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.84 billion cubic feet today, or 70 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.86
billion cubic feet at 2:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
