BMC Software Inc. (BMC) , after pressure by
investor Elliott Associates LP to consider a sale, said it has
agreed to nominate two directors chosen by Elliott to its board.  BMC increased the size of its board to 12, effective as of
its annual shareholder meeting set for July 25, the Houston-
based company said in a statement today. Elliott agreed to
withdraw its slate and support BMC’s selections.  BMC, a maker of software to manage corporate  computer
networks , adopted takeover defenses in May after Elliott amassed
a stake of more than 5 percent and said it would seek five board
seats to push for a sale. With the agreement today, BMC can
focus on sales growth and avoid a prolonged standoff that could
have caused it to lose some customers, said Abhey Lamba, an
analyst at Mizuho Securities USA Inc.  “The agreement implies that the company is unlikely to be
acquired in the near term,” Lamba said in a research report
today.  The  stock  decreased 0.4 percent to $42.42 at 9:49 a.m. in
 New York . Through yesterday, the stock had surged 30 percent
this year.  “BMC’s board and senior management team remain highly
committed to enhancing value for all BMC stockholders,” Chief
Executive Officer Bob Beauchamp said in the statement.  John Dillon , former Chief Executive Officer at
 Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , and Jim Schaper, chairman at software-maker
Infor Global Solutions Inc., were chosen by Elliott to join
BMC’s slate.  BMC “possesses significant value which can be realized
through a variety of pathways,” said Jesse Cohn, Elliott
portfolio manager, in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
