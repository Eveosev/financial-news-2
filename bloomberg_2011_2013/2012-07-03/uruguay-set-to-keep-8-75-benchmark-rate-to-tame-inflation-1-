Uruguay’s central bank will probably
keep its  benchmark interest rate  unchanged today as above-target
inflation outweighs concern that the country’s economy is
slowing more than expected.  The five-member policy committee, led by bank President
Mario Bergara, will keep the rate at 8.75 percent for the second
straight meeting after raising it 75 basis points, or 0.75
percentage point, in December 2011, according to all four
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg. The board will announce its
decision about 5 p.m. local time.  Annual inflation in the agriculture-based economy was
little  changed  at 8 percent in June compared with 8.06 percent
the previous month, above the upper limit of the central bank’s
target range of 4 percent to 6 percent. Prices rose 8.6 percent
in 2011.  “The international situation today is riskier, but the
central bank cannot lower rates because inflation is at
uncomfortable levels,” said Florencia Carriquiry, an economist
at Deloitte Uruguay in Montevideo.  Since September 2010, the bank has raised borrowing costs
at four of its seven meetings to push the overnight rate up by
2.5 percentage points from 6.25 percent.  The government forecasts inflation will slow to an average
of 7.6 percent in 2012, according to budget estimates submitted
to congress last month. Analysts expect consumer prices will
rise 7.8 percent in 2012 and 6.9 percent in 2013, according to
the median estimate in a central bank survey released in June.  “Inflation will remain around 8 percent unless commodity
prices fall further,” said Carriquiry, who forecasts inflation
of 7.7 percent this year.  Economic Growth  The central bank on June 14 reported that Uruguay’s $45
billion economy expanded  4.2 percent  in the first quarter of
2012 from same period last year, which Carriquiry called
positive even though it was probably overshadowed by the
worsening global outlook.  “The international context imposes more risks to economic
activity, and that is something the central bank will take into
account in its decision,” Carriquiry said.  The  International Monetary Fund  forecasts the country’s
gross domestic product will expand 3.5 percent in 2012, down
from 5.7 percent last year and 8.9 percent in 2010.  The closing of the La Teja refinery for maintenance and a
subsequent workers’ strike weighed on growth from August until
the facility re-started in January. Rising import barriers in
neighboring  Argentina  are also undercutting Uruguay’s economy.  Capital Flows  Brazil ’s decision to cut its  benchmark rate  for a seventh
straight meeting in May to a record low 8.5 percent combined
with slowing growth in  Latin America ’s biggest economy will help
make Uruguay more attractive to international investors, Bergara
said May 22.  Speaking to reporters, Bergara also said that Uruguay’s
return to investment grade standing for the first time in a
decade should boost capital inflows and investment.  Standard & Poor’s  on April 3 raised Uruguay’s credit rating
one level to BBB-.  Fitch Ratings  and Moody’s Investors Service
rate the country one level below investment grade.  The peso has declined 10.3 percent in the last three months
to 21.75 per dollar today, the weakest level since September
2009. The peso has been the world’s third-worst performing
currency during the past three months among 171 tracked by
Bloomberg, beating only the Syrian pound and Malawian kwacha,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on Uruguayan dollar bonds maturing in 2022 has
declined 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage point, to 3.32
percent in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
price of the securities is up 3.86 cents to 140.7 cents on the
dollar.  The central bank committee’s next quarterly meeting will be
in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
