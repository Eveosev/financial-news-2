Coinstar Inc., owner of the Redbox
movie rental kiosks, rose to an all-time closing high on
enthusiasm for the company’s DVD expansion plans and streaming
venture with  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)   Coinstar gained 2.6 percent to $70.46 at the close in New
York, the highest since shares of the Bellevue, Washington-based
company began trading in 1997. The stock has advanced 54 percent
this year.  Investors are recognizing the benefits of Coinstar’s
acquisition of  NCR Corp. (NCR) ’s DVD rental business, which eliminated
a large competitor, and its plans for the joint venture with
Verizon,  Eric Wold , a San Francisco-based analyst with B. Riley
& Co., said today in an interview. The streaming business starts
in August, Wold said.  “Investors are buying ahead of another round of good news
to come,” said Wold, who  recommends  buying the stock.  Last month, Coinstar announced a joint venture with
 Starbucks Corp. (SBUX)  to sell Seattle’s Best Coffee in vending
machines in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
