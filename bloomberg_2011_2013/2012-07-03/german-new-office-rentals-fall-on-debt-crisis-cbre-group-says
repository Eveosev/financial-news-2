The amount of additional office space
rented out in  Germany ’s five largest cities fell 13 percent in
the first half as companies were deterred by economic
uncertainty caused by the  European debt crisis .  Office leases for 1.17 million square meters (12.6 million
square feet) were signed in Berlin, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt,
Hamburg and Munich, Los-Angeles based broker  CBRE Group Inc. (CBG) 
said in a statement today.  “Against the backdrop of the continuing sovereign debt
crisis, many companies are putting off their site decisions,”
said Heiko Fischer, Head of Agency at CBRE’s Hamburg office.  Prime-office rents rose and vacancies fell because of a
shrinking supply of new space, as developers built less and
turned unused office buildings into hotels and apartments.  In  Frankfurt , the amount of space rented fell 0.9 percent
to 228,100 square meters in the first half from a year earlier.
Prime rent was unchanged at 38 euros ($48) per square meter.  In Hamburg, new leases sank the most, by 21.4 percent to
205,500 square meters, and rents rose 6.7 percent. In
Dusseldorf, prime rents rose the most, by 8.7 percent to 25
euros per square meter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
