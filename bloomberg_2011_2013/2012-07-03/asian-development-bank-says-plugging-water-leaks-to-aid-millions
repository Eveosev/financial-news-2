Plugging leaks that are costing
 Asia ’s water utilities at least $9 billion a year in revenue
would reduce water loss and aid tens of millions of people,
according to an  Asian Development Bank  study.  “While Asia and the Pacific is increasingly facing a major
water crisis, we see unacceptable levels of water being lost
through leaks and inefficiencies,” said Bindu Lohani, ADB’s vice
president for knowledge management and sustainable development.
“By cutting the amount of lost water in half, 150 million people
could be supplied with treated water.”  About 29 billion cubic meters of water is lost each year in
the region, enough to fill more than 11 million Olympic-sized
swimming pools, the Manila-based bank said today at the start of
Singapore International Water Week. A low rate of unaccounted-
for water is critical, the ADB said, cited  Phnom Penh  as having
brought its lost water rate down to 6 percent when some levels
in the region are as high as 60 percent.  The ADB’s shareholders consist of 67 countries. The U.S.
and  Japan  hold the most voting power.  To contact the reporter on this story:
