Ireland will sell bills this week in
the first public debt auction since the nation sought a bailout
in 2010, betting on a return of investors amid signs the economy
is recovering from a banking crisis.  The National Treasury Management Agency will sell 500
million euros ($630 million) of treasury bills in two days, the
Dublin-based debt office said today in a statement on its
website. The securities mature on Oct. 15 and mark the first
sale in a “phased re-entry” to markets, Chief Executive
Officer  John Corrigan  said.  With the economy stabilizing after shrinking about 15
percent since 2007, the NTMA said last month a bill sale in the
“summer months” would pave the way for a full return to bond
markets by year-end or early 2013. Ireland was frozen out of
auctioning debt in 2010 because of concern the country’s banks
would overwhelm sovereign finances. The government was forced to
seek an international bailout in November that year.  “It’s positive news, Ireland has done relatively well in
its reform program,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “The market is
saying that perhaps Ireland is on its way out of the bailout
program.”  Falling Yields  Irish yields have declined after European leaders agreed at
a summit in Brussels on June 29 that bailout funds will be able
to directly recapitalize banks. Ireland’s government wants this
policy to apply retrospectively to its lenders after pledging
about 64 billion euros to save its financial system, equivalent
to about 40 percent of gross domestic product.  Ireland’s bailout partners, the  International Monetary
Fund ,  European Central Bank  and European Union begin their
seventh review of the country’s bailout program today. The
assessment will last almost two weeks, Paul Bolger, a Finance
Ministry spokesman, said on June 25.  The 5 percent security due in October 2020 rose for the
fifth straight day, with the yield falling 11 basis points to
6.23 percent at 1:31 p.m. London time, the lowest since October
2010. The rate was at 7.11 percent on June 28, and exceeded 14
percent about a year ago.  Credit-Default Swaps  Credit-default swaps on Ireland have tumbled near to the
level when the government last came to market. Five-year
contracts fell 24 basis points today to 503, the lowest since
November 2010 and near to the 460 basis point level on Sept. 23,
2010, when Ireland last sold bills. The swaps are down from a
peak of 1,181 basis points last year and 726 on May 31.  The bills may be priced at a rate of less than 2 percent,
said Andy McEntee, head of money markets at Davy, a primary
dealer in Irish government debt. Unlike Ireland,  Greece  and
 Portugal  have kept selling bills since they received bailouts.  “Ireland issuing T-bills is by no means the big deal that
some are making it out to be,” said  Megan Greene , a senior
economist at Roubini Global Economics LLC in London. “It
reflects an improvement in investor confidence off the back of
last week’s EU summit.” Once details of the agreement emerge,
“everyone will be disappointed,” Greene said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
