Mitt Romney  spokesman  Eric Fehrnstrom  said that his boss views Obamacare’s individual mandate as a penalty, not a tax. This has the Washington Examiner’s Conn Carroll  up in arms . Romney is off-message if he says the mandate is not a tax! Wait a minute. Let’s say Romney does what many congressional Republicans have  done with enthusiasm , and declares that the mandate is a tax. Isn’t that an endorsement of  John Roberts ’s hated opinion that upheld Obamacare on the grounds that the mandate is a tax? I think the mandate  is a tax  and that Romney is wrong (and so is Obama, on the days when he insists the mandate isn’t a tax.) But then, I think the individual mandate is constitutional. If Republicans have a message coordination problem, it’s not on Romney’s end. It’s with Republicans who are accidentally endorsing the logic behind the judicial opinion they hate.
