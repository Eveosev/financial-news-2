Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for a
third day as the central bank curbed total  money supply  through
 repurchase agreements  and term-auction deposits.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
0.2 percent to close at 83.90 per dollar, extending its gains
this year to 1.4 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Kenya sold 2.77 billion shillings ($33 million) in seven-
day repurchase agreements at a weighted average rate of 16.613
percent, a central bank official, who asked not to be identified
in line with policy, said.  The bank also accepted 1.75 billion shillings of 14-day
term auction deposits at 16.75 percent, 1.5 billion shillings of
21-day deposits at 16.90 percent and 2.03 billion shillings in
28-day deposits at 16.94 percent, the official said today by
phone from the capital. The sale today is the fifth auction from
June 27 after the bank stayed out for five days from June 20
through June 26, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Longer-tenure term auction deposits were introduced “as an
additional instrument for liquidity management,” the bank said
June 5.  Kenyan  inflation  slowed to a 15-month low in June,
declining for the seventh straight month to 10.1 percent from
12.2 percent in May, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics
said in an e-mailed statement on June 29. Inflation is down from
a peak of nearly 20 percent in November. Kenya’s central bank
monetary policy committee, which raised the benchmark  interest
rate  to a record 18 percent last year to curb price gains and
support the shilling, is set to meet on July 5, according to the
bank’s  website .  Tanzania’s shilling weakened for a second day, the longest
losing streak since June 7, depreciating 0.3 percent to close at
1,580 per dollar, while  Uganda ’s shilling gained 0.1 percent to
2,472.50 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
