Spanish  registered unemployment  in
June fell in the run up to the country’s peak tourism season.  The number of people registering for  unemployment benefits 
fell by 98,853 from May to 4.62 million, data released by the
 Labor Ministry  in  Madrid  showed. That was the biggest drop in
the month of June since the data series began.  Tourism is the biggest contributor to the country’s gross
domestic product. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said July 1
that data available for the second quarter suggest an economic
contraction slightly superior to the first quarter’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
