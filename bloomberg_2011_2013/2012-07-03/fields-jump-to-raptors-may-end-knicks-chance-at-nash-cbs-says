New York Knicks  restricted free agent
Landry Fields agreed on an offer sheet with the  Toronto Raptors ,
probably reducing the Knicks’ chances to sign two-time league
Most Valuable Player  Steve Nash , CBS Sports  reported today .  The Knicks have three days after he signs to decide whether
to match the three-year, $20 million offer, CBS reported citing
Fields’ agent, Chris Emens. No contracts or trades can be
formally finished until July 11. Calls to Emens’s office weren’t
answered.  Nash is a National Basketball Association free agent after
playing the last eight seasons with the Phoenix Suns. The Knicks
had discussed a double sign-and-trade with Phoenix in which the
Suns received Fields, CBS reported. That deal is now dead. If
the Knicks don’t match the Raptors’ offer, they lose Fields; if
they do match, they can’t trade him under the league’s labor
agreement.  The Raptors are also interested in Nash, 38, who grew up in
Canada. The team offered him a three-year, $36 million deal,
according to CBS.  Fields, 24, has averaged 9.3 points and 5.4 rebounds per
game in his two-year NBA career with the Knicks. Nash is an
eight-time All-Star and was the league’s MVP in 2005 and 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
