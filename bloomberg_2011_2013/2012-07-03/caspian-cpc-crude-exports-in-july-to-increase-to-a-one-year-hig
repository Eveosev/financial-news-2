The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
which operates the only oil export link in  Russia  with foreign
shareholders, will boost daily crude exports for July from the
 Black Sea  to near a one-year high, according to a final loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 26 cargoes totaling 2.6
million metric tons, according to the schedule. That’s equal to
20.2 million barrels, or 650,888 barrels a day, up 4.8 percent
from 621,341 barrels planned for June and the most since
September 2011.  This compares with 25 cargoes totaling 2.52 million tons,
or 632,754 barrels a day, in the preliminary plan for July
released on June 12.  Actual shipments from the terminal were 2.66 million tons
in June, compared with 2.397 million tons in May, CPC said today
on its  website . Buyers typically load cargoes that swing within
a 5-percent range depending on operational situations.  The CPC pipeline, in which  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from  Kazakhstan ’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s
Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea. Russia owns 31 percent and
Kazakhstan 20.75 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO Lukoil and a
joint venture between OAO Rosneft and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  are
among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
