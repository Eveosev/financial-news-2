Perpetual Ltd. (PPT) , the Australian fund
manager with a 3.7 percent stake in casino operator  Echo
Entertainment Group Ltd. (EGP) , has regulatory approval to own more
than 10 percent of the company.  Perpetual can lift its maximum voting power in Echo, which
operates Sydney’s only casino and three in Queensland state, to
15 percent following approvals from regulators in New South
Wales state and Queensland, Echo said today in a statement to
the Australian Securities Exchange.  Rival casino operator  Crown Ltd. (CWN)  and companies linked to
 Genting Bhd. (GENT)  are awaiting approvals to increase their stakes
beyond 10 percent, possibly presaging a bidding war for Echo,
said Siobhan Weston, an analyst at  Citigroup Inc. Crown,
controlled by billionaire  James Packer , has 9 percent of Echo,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The applications from Crown and Genting highlight “the bid
interest in the company which should continue to underpin the
stock price in the short term” Weston wrote in a note to
clients June 27.  Echo rose 0.6 percent to A$4.29 as of 11:09 a.m. in Sydney.
The shares have jumped 18 percent since Crown disclosed its
stake Feb. 24.  Genting HK and Genting Singapore Plc together own 8.9
percent of Echo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Perpetual has reduced its stake to about 28.7 million shares,
from about 62.3 million as of July 27, 2011, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
