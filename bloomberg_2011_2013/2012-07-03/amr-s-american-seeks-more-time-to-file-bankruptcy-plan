AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American Airlines asked a
judge to extend until the end of the year the carrier’s
exclusive right to propose a plan to restructure and exit
bankruptcy protection.  American needs more time to negotiate terms of a bankruptcy
plan as it works to cut labor costs and consider “strategic
alternatives,” according to a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan.  The extension is “warranted and necessary to afford
American a meaningful opportunity to pursue the Chapter 11
reorganization process and build a consensus among economic
stakeholders,” the company and the committee representing
unsecured creditors said in the filing.  American’s exclusive right to file a bankruptcy plan
expires Sept. 28. The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier and the
committee are asking for an extension to Dec. 28, according to
the filing.  An extension approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane
would prevent rival plans from being filed during the period.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
