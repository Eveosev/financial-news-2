The ruble appreciated to the
strongest in a month as oil,  Russia ’s chief export earner, rose
on speculation central banks from Europe to China may ease
monetary policy to bolster economic growth.  The Russian currency strengthened 1.4 percent to 32.1500
per dollar, the highest level since May 28, after weakening 9.2
percent in the second quarter.  Crude oil climbed 0.8 percent to $84.40 a barrel in New
York, extending its 7.8 percent jump in the past two sessions.
Oil and gas contribute about 50 percent of Russia’s state
revenue. The  European Central Bank  is forecast to cut  interest
rates  this week to stimulate demand. A state-owned newspaper in
China said the time is ripe for a reduction in banks’  reserve-
requirement ratios , which means monetary easing. A deterioration
in U.S. employment data this week may prompt the  Federal Reserve 
to initiate fresh stimulus, BNP Paribas SA said.  Citigroup Inc. sees the ruble trading in the range of 37
rubles to 38 rubles against the basket in the second quarter,
analysts led by  David Lubin  said in an e-mailed research note
today. “We assume oil prices at about $100 a barrel and global
 risk aversion  remaining slightly above the normal level in the
second quarter,” the analysts said in the note. “Basket
appreciation below 35 rubles is very unlikely even if the oil
price recovers to $110 in the third quarter.”  The Russian currency appreciated 1.1 percent to 40.5400 per
euro and 1.2 percent to 35.9255 against the central bank’s
target dollar-euro basket. Investors lowered bets on the
currency weakening, with non-deliverable forwards showing the
ruble at 32.6590 per dollar in three months, compared with
investor expectations of 33.1198 per dollar yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
