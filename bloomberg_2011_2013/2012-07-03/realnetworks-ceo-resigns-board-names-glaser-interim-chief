RealNetworks Inc. (RNWK)  Chief Executive
Officer Thomas Nielsen has resigned amid an effort to
restructure the software maker.  Nielsen, who took the helm  Nov. 1,  was replaced on an
interim basis by chairman and founder Rob Glaser, the Seattle-
based company said today in a statement. The board has begun a
search for a new CEO, and Glaser said he isn’t a candidate for
the permanent position.  RealNetworks, whose stock has declined 36 percent in the
past year, said in May it planned “significant”  restructuring 
in 2012, including acquisitions, divestitures and changes to
operations. Nielsen’s departure follows changes to management
earlier this year, including the resignation of legal chief
Tracy Daw in April and the addition of a new chief financial
officer, Tim Wan, the same month, regulatory filings show.  “I come back to RealNetworks with a sense of great urgency
to set the company on a long-term path to success,” Glaser said
in the statement.  The company “has a great deal of potential and
opportunity, with huge reach and distribution of our products,”
he said.  RealNetworks offers applications and services, such as live
streaming, that help customers use digital media. The company
reported a first-quarter loss of 49 cents a share, exceeding the
33 cent-loss estimated by analysts, and was its fifth
consecutive quarterly loss, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
