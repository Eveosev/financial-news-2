Urban Land Institute, a Washington-
based research organization, may help  Turkey  tap as much as $1.5
billion of World Bank loans for projects for cheap housing,
Vatan reported, citing Haluk Sur, the institute’s Turkey
president.  The loans could have maturities of as much as 30 years with
a 5-year grace period, Sur said, according to the Istanbul-based
newspaper. The institute is ready to arrange the loan for the
Turkish Treasury, the Urban Ministry and mass housing fund Toki,
he said. Sur is also a member of the board of directors at  Emlak
Konut Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (EKGYO) , Turkey’s biggest real-
estate investment company, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
