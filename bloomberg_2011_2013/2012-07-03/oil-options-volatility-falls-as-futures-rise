Crude-oil options volatility was
little changed as underlying futures surged on speculation that
central banks will ease monetary policies and  Iran  oil sanctions
will reduce supplies.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
August, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 34.71 percent at 3 p.m. on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange, up from 34.42 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for August delivery rose $3.91 to $87.66 a barrel
on the Nymex, the highest settlement price since May 30.  Futures rose as the  European Central Bank  was forecast to
reduce  interest rates  this week, a state-controlled newspaper in
 China  called for a cut in bank reserve ratios and Iran
threatened to block tanker traffic in the  Strait of Hormuz .  The most active options in electronic trading today were
August $95 calls, which rose 30 cents to 42 cents a barrel at
3:05 p.m. with 5,572 lots trading. September $115 calls were the
second-most active options, with 5,004 lots changing hands as
they gained 10 cents to 18 cents.  Calls accounted for four of the most heavily traded options
and 63 percent of total electronic trading volume. One contract
covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bullish bets accounted for 56 percent of the 154,351
contracts traded in the previous session. August $92 calls were
the most actively traded, with 11,747 lots changing hands. They
fell 9 cents to 24 cents. The next-most active options,
September $65 puts, advanced 2 cents to 18 cents on volume of
9,410.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 44,694
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 40,357 lots and
December $70 puts with 35,711.  To contact the reporter on this story:
