Boeing Co. (BA)  said growth in industry
plane deliveries will slow in the next 20 years as demand for
jumbo jets and freighters wanes, with the global fleet expanding
at less than a fifth of the rate predicted in 2011.  Airlines will take 34,000 new planes valued at $4.5
trillion through 2031, Chicago-based Boeing said today. That’s a
1.5 percent increase from a 33,500-jet estimate last year, when
the planemaker raised its two-decade forecast by 8.4 percent.  Boeing gives its 20-year prediction annually, offering a
glimpse of how it sees the market for new aircraft and airlines’
passenger and cargo traffic. While sales of twin-aisle jets will
increase, orders will slow for the largest such planes, its own
747 and Airbus SAS’s A380 superjumbo, the company said.  “The forecast reflects the economic struggles we see today
in some of the mature markets,”  Randy Tinseth , Boeing’s vice
president of marketing, said in a press briefing in  London .
“The economic growth rate for this forecast is down.”  Fuel bills for four-engine planes such as the 747 and
double-decker A380 have been pushing airlines toward longer-
range twin-engine models that burn less kerosene. Orders last
year for Boeing’s 777 reached a record 202, while the new 747-8
had only seven sales, according to Boeing’s website.  Fewer Sales  There also will be fewer sales of narrow-body planes,
according to the forecast, which accounts for new models from
planemakers in  China ,  Canada  and  Russia . That category, which
includes Boeing’s 737, makes up the bulk of the global fleet.  “One or two” new competitors will gain traction in that
segment near the end of the 20-year period, Tinseth said. He
said Boeing’s 737 MAX model, revamped with new engines, will be
good enough to keep market-share parity with Airbus’s A320neo.
Airbus Chief Operating Officer  John Leahy  said yesterday that
his goal is to win 60 percent of the global market for single-
aisle planes within the next few years.  Demand is strongest in  Asia , where Boeing predicted buyers
will get 12,030 new planes by 2031, a 5.1 percent jump from the
2011 forecast. Boeing now sees fewer purchases in  North America ,
 Latin America  and the  Middle East  than a year earlier. It cut
the North America forecast by 3.2 percent to 7,290 planes.  Passenger traffic will rise about 5 percent a year in the
next two decades, Boeing predicted. The U.S. planemaker and
Toulouse, France-based Airbus are pushing output to record
levels to trim backlogs of more than 8,000 jetliners,
representing more than seven years of work at current rates.  ‘Continued Challenges’  “We do expect continued challenges in the European market
and general economy this year and next year,” Tinseth said on a
conference call. “Once the economy gets back on its feet, we
expect continued growth moving forward.”  Boeing  shares  are unchanged in the past year, compared with
a 24 percent gain for those of Airbus parent European
Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. Boeing rose 1.5 percent to
$74.27 at the close today in  New York , while EADS fell 0.2
percent to 28.43 euros in Paris.  While Boeing’s forecast predicts only a 1.5 percent gain in
aircraft numbers versus last year’s outlook, the value of those
planes will rise by almost 13 percent as airlines opt for larger
jets, which are more expensive, Tinseth said.  The average plane will get about 5 percent bigger during
the next 20 years, Tinseth said. That will shift the “middle of
the market” to jets equivalent to an 185-seat Airbus A321 or
737-900ER, compared with a 150-seater now such as an A320 or
737-800.  Boeing cited a “sluggish” cargo market in paring its
forecast for jet freighters. Until last week’s order by  FedEx
Corp. (FDX) , Boeing hadn’t sold any cargo aircraft this year, and the
market remains “volatile,” Tinseth said.  Cargo traffic will gain 5.2 percent annually, down from a
previous forecast of 5.6 percent, the planemaker predicted.  Boeing has issued annual 20-year forecasts since 1964. In
2009, the company reduced its outlook for the first time in at
least a decade as carriers canceled and deferred orders because
of a travel slump in the recession. The following year’s report
bumped the projection up by 6.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
