The  Bank of England  may limit an
extension to its bond-buying program to avoid distorting the
gilt market during the  London  Olympics, according to Lloyds
Banking Group Plc.  The U.K. central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee will
raise its  target for asset-buying  by 75 billion pounds ($118
billion) to 400 billion pounds on July 5, Lloyds estimates.
Should it plan a hiatus during the Olympics, it may only
announce a 50 billion-pound increase, said Eric Wand, a fixed-
income strategist in London. That would prevent it from
overwhelming supply during a pause in gilt auctions scheduled
between July 20 and Aug. 16, he said.  “Given the almost one-month break from supply, the bank is
expected to remain very cognizant of the potential market
distortions it is capable of inflicting over this period,” Wand
wrote in an e-mailed note today. “We would expect an
announcement to the effect that it will be tempering its gilt-
purchase activities over the latter part of July, early August
when participation rates are likely to prove challenging.”  A sale of index-linked gilts via banks will take place as
planned in the second half of July, a spokesman for the debt
agency, who declined to be named, said yesterday. The Debt
Management Office’s weekly Treasury bill tenders will also take
place as usual in the period July 27 through Aug. 12 when the
Olympics are taking place, he said.  The agency published its issuance calendar, including the
pause for the Olympics, when the  U.K. budget  was announced on
March 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
