TriWest Healthcare Alliance Corp.,
the closely held company built on providing military medical
services, is weighing its next move after unsuccessfully
challenging a $20.5 billion  UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH)  contract.  The Government Accountability Office, which arbitrates
contract disputes, denied a protest from Phoenix-based TriWest
yesterday over the Pentagon’s March decision to give the
contract to UnitedHealth.  TriWest, which has about 1,700 employees, must now decide
whether to file additional challenges to the contract awarded to
the nation’s largest health insurer, or sacrifice the source of
almost all its revenue.  “There’s an awful lot at stake for TriWest, so they may
want to go down fighting and they may win,” said  Sheryl Skolnick , an analyst with CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut . “Until the last possible avenue of protest is
exhausted, I have a feeling this contract won’t be finally
awarded.”  The GAO decision found that the Defense Department’s
evaluation of the competing bids “was reasonable,” Ralph O. White, the GAO’s managing associate general counsel for
procurement law, said in an e-mailed statement. It denied
TriWest’s protest “on all counts,” he said.  Tricare Dependence  TriWest owes its existence to Tricare, the Pentagon’s
health program. The company has helped manage military medical
services for the past 16 years, after being founded in 1996 by
David McIntyre Jr., the company’s chief executive officer and a
former aide to Republican Senator  John McCain . It is owned by a
holding company made up of a group of nonprofit Blue Cross Blue
Shield plans and university hospital systems.  The military health work has generated more than $20
billion in contracts for the company since fiscal 2000,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Without the contract, “it is likely” the company would
shut down, McIntyre has previously said.  “There are options that remain,” Scott Celley, a TriWest
spokesman, said in a phone interview yesterday. He declined to
comment on the company’s next moves, saying TriWest officials
need to review the details of the decision. Companies may file
suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims over contract disputes.  Ad Attacks  More than a dozen U.S. lawmakers, including some from
 Arizona ,  Colorado  and Washington state, sent letters to Defense
Secretary  Leon Panetta  seeking an explanation of why the
Pentagon picked UnitedHealth over TriWest.  TriWest has blanketed the Washington area in recent weeks
with ads attacking UnitedHealth and saying that “Military
families deserve better.”  The ads usually highlight UnitedHealth’s prior legal woes,
including a $350 million settlement the insurer paid after the
 American Medical Association  alleged it had manipulated payments
to doctors. The agreement was announced in January 2009.  Some ads also point to negative comments about UnitedHealth
by Consumer Reports magazine, which the Minnetonka, Minnesota-
based UnitedHealth has tried to deflect with positive reviews
from similar sources.  The GAO decision “expresses no view as to the merits of
these firms’ respective proposals,” the GAO’s White said in his
statement yesterday.  No Obligation  White’s office is under no obligation to consider issues
such as a vendor’s prior legal settlements or Consumer Reports
ratings in its review unless the Pentagon specifically said such
items would play a factor in its decision-making, said Daniel
Gordon, who stepped down in December as President  Barack Obama ’s
top procurement official.  “I’d be surprised to see GAO sustain a protest about that
topic without a clear commitment by the agency in the
solicitation,” Gordon said in an e-mail. He is now the
associate dean for government procurement law at George
Washington University Law School.  The Pentagon gave UnitedHealth the contract on March 16,
almost a year after the company had persuaded it to reconsider
its initial award of the same contract to TriWest in 2009.
UnitedHealth’s bid was lower during the original competition,
according to an agency memo. TriWest officials have said
Pentagon officials told them their bid was lower this time
around during a March debriefing.  UnitedHealth shares fell 1.3 percent to $55.50 at 11:46
a.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange Composite trading. The shares
yesterday slipped 3.8 percent, the biggest decline since
October.  Revenue Boost  Its stock has dropped because there are continuing worries
about how last week’s  Supreme Court  ruling, which upholds U.S.
health-care reform legislation, will affect insurers, CRT
Capital’s Skolnick said in a phone interview yesterday.  “Things are a little bit in turmoil in health-care land,”
she said.  UnitedHealth said in March that the $20.5 billion contract,
which includes pass-through costs for medical providers such as
hospitals and doctors’ offices, will generate $1.4 billion in
revenue for the company over five years. That’s about 1.4
percent of the $101.9 billion in revenue UnitedHealth had last
year.  The GAO decision bodes well for UnitedHealth, said  Ana Gupte , an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in New York.  “It now places them firmly in every government program,”
she said.  TriWest Discussing  UnitedHealth looks forward to working with the Pentagon and
TriWest “to ensure a smooth transition for service members,
retirees and their families,” Lori C. McDougal, chief executive
officer of the unit of the company that will handle the
contract, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  UnitedHealth is scheduled to take over the contract in
April 1, 2013, managing care for active-duty military, retirees
and their families in 21 states, mostly in the West. It would
become one of Tricare’s lead contractors for the first time.  TriWest was ranked No. 21 on the Bloomberg Government top
200 federal contractor list released last month. It received
$3.1 billion in awards during the fiscal year that ended Sept.
30.  “We will be discussing this decision with our company’s
owners and the counsel who represent us, and will, in turn, be
making a decision on what, if any, action we will take,”
TriWest’s McIntyre said in an e-mailed statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story: Kathleen Miller in
