A Republican-led U.S. House oversight
panel asked Abound Solar Inc.’s chief executive officer to
testify at a July 18 hearing on the company’s U.S. loan
guarantee.  The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee’s
stimulus oversight panel wrote to Chief Executive Officer Craig
Witsoe yesterday requesting he attend the hearing. Abound
announced last week it was closing, after being awarded a $400
million loan guarantee in 2010.  The company borrowed about $70 million against its
guarantee. The Energy Department has said taxpayers may lose $40
million to $60 million on the loan after Abound’s assets are
sold and the bankruptcy proceeding closes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
