Overseas  investors  bought a net  38.9
billion rupees  ($697.6 million) of Indian stocks on June 29 and
July 2, raising their investment in equities this year to 458.9
billion rupees, according to the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 69.3 billion rupees of shares and sold
30.4 billion rupees over the two days, the Securities & Exchange
Board of  India  said on its  website  today. Foreign funds bought a
net 8.49 billion rupees of bonds over the period, taking total
inflow into debt this year to 217.1 billion rupees, the data
 show .  India on June 28 proposed that a clampdown on  tax avoidance 
due in 2013 won’t apply retrospectively or to cases below a
certain monetary threshold, helping allay investor concerns. The
draft guidelines released by the  finance ministry  on that day
also proposed exempting foreign institutional investors if they
refrain from routing money to India via tax shelters such as
Mauritius.  Foreigners have invested 4.903 trillion rupees in stocks
and 1.424 trillion rupees in bonds since they were allowed into
the country in 1993.  India’s $1.1 trillion stock market,  Asia ’s fifth-biggest,
is influenced by flows from overseas. Flows surged to a record
in 2010, making the  BSE India Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  the best performer
among the world’s top 10 markets. The largest-ever outflow in
2008 led to the biggest annual slump of 52 percent.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
