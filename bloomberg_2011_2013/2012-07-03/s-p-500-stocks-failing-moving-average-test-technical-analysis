Gains that drove the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index to its biggest June advance since 1999 may
falter because too few stocks are rising with enough speed,
StockCharts.com Inc. said.  The benchmark gauge of American equities surged 2.5 percent
on June 29, finishing the month up 4 percent, amid optimism that
European leaders will prevent bank losses from multiplying.
While the rally drove 64 percent of shares above their average
price during the past 50 days, that’s short of the 85 percent
threshold that usually accompany longer rallies, said Arthur Hill, a technical analyst at the Redmond, Washington-based firm.  “A surge above 85 percent shows strong-enough buying
pressure to suggest that an uptrend is emerging,” Hill wrote in
a note yesterday. “It is like a rocket lifting off the launch
pad. A strong up-thrust is needed to insure a sustainable
advance.”  Concern that Spanish banks might fail and  Greece  would
leave the 17-nation euro zone drove the  S&P 500  down as much as
9.9 percent from a four-year high in April. The benchmark index
climbed 2 percent last week as euro-area leaders agreed to relax
conditions on emergency loans for Spanish banks and possible
help for  Italy . Even after the rebound, the benchmark gauge was
down 3.3 percent since the end of March, the  worst performance 
since last year’s third quarter.msg  While 85 percent is where momentum becomes self-sustaining,
equity declines are likely to speed up when the number of stocks
above the 50-day mean slips below 15 percent, Hill said.  The gauge decreased below 15 percent on May 18 for the
first time since Oct. 3, when the S&P 500 hit its 2011 low and
began a six-month, 29 percent rally. That advance lifted more
than 85 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 above their 50-day
mean in October and again in January, according to data compiled
by StockCharts.com.  To contact the reporters on this story:
