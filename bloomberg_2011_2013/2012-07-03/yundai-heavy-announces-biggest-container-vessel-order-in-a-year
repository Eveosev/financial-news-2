Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. (009540) , the
world’s biggest shipbuilder, won an order to build 10 mega-
container vessels for $1.2 billion, the biggest new contract for
the type industrywide in a year.  The vessels, each able to hold 13,800 20-foot boxes, will
be operated by  Evergreen Group , the Ulsan, South Korea-based
shipbuilder said in a statement today. Evergreen will lease the
vessels from Enesel SA, the Taiwanese shipping line said
separately. Deliveries are due to start in the second half of
next year.  Hyundai Heavy rose the most in three weeks in  Seoul  trading
on speculation the order may mark a revival in demand for new
ships following a slump caused by slower trade, reduced
availability of financing and lower charter rates. Global ship
orders dropped 39 percent from a year earlier in the first five
months of the year to 16.5 million deadweight tons, according to
data compiled by shipbroker  Clarkson Plc. (CKN)   “This order could be a signal that things could be
bottoming out for the shipbuilding industry,” said Lee Jae Won,
an analyst at Tong Yang Securities Inc. in Seoul.  Hyundai Heavy advanced as much as 3.7 percent, the most
since June 11, to 266,000 won and traded at 265,500 won as of
11:55 a.m. in Seoul. Evergreen Marine Corp. dropped as much as
1.6 percent, the biggest decline in about a month, to NT$15.90
in Taipei.  Big Ships  Evergreen will join lines including A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S
and Neptune Orient Lines Ltd. in adding mega-container vessels
as operators strive to pare costs by using more fuel-efficient
ships. Bunker fuel prices have risen 39 percent in the past two
years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Maersk, the biggest container-shipping company, has ordered
20 vessels able to carry 18,000 boxes apiece. The ships, which
will be the largest afloat, will cut costs by 26 percent per
boxes compared with current vessels, according to the
Copenhagen-based company. The first two are due to be delivered
by Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. next year.  Worldwide, orders for vessels able to carry more than 8,000
containers account for 72 percent of the current total backlog
by capacity, according to Clarkson data.  STX Offshore & Shipbuilding Co., the world’s fourth-biggest
shipyard, had a contract revised in November to build six ships
that can each carry 16,000 boxes from an earlier order for
13,000. The deal includes an option to order four more vessels.  A Hyundai Heavy unit received a $1.3 billion order from
Neptune Orient in June last year to build 10 vessels that can
each carry 13,900 boxes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
