Sourcefire Inc. (FIRE) , a U.S. network
security company, fell after saying that Chief Executive Officer
John Burris has taken a medical leave for colon-cancer
treatment.  Shares of the Columbia, Maryland-based company  declined  3.8
percent to $50.43 at the close. Sourcefire had advanced 62
percent this year through yesterday.  Founder and Chief Technology Officer Martin F. Roesch will
serve as interim CEO while Burris undergoes treatment, the
company said in a statement yesterday. Burris, 57, will continue
to serve as a board member and will provide “strategic input”
while on leave.  Sourcefire has “ample management in place” to continue in
Burris’s absence, Mark Jordan, an analyst at Noble Financial
Capital Markets in  Boca Raton ,  Florida , said in an interview.
Jordan recommends investors buy the shares.  Sourcefire also said second-quarter revenue and adjusted
net income per share will be “at the high end to slightly
above” its previous projections for sales of as much as $48.5
million and profit of a maximum of 14 cents a share. Analysts
projected earnings of 14 cents a share on sales of $48.6
million, the average of  estimates .  To contact the reporter on this story:
