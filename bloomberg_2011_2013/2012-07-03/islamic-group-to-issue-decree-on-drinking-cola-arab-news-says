The  International Islamic Fiqh
Academy  in  Jeddah ,  Saudi Arabia , will determine whether drinking
cola is permissible for Muslims after a French study found some
may contain minuscule traces of alcohol,  Arab News  reported.  A religious decree will be issued by the beginning of next
year after the Islamic body consults doctors, chemists and other
experts on the topic, the Jeddah-based newspaper reported,
citing Sheikh Mohammed Al-Nujaimi, a member of the academy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
