Mongolia Energy Corp. (276) , a mineral and
energy explorer, fell to the lowest level in more than five
years in  Hong Kong  after posting a record full-year net loss.  The shares dropped as much as 15 percent to 35 Hong Kong
cents and traded at 35.5 cents as of 11:14 a.m. local time, the
lowest level since Feb. 7, 2007. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index 
gained 1.6 percent. Hong Kong’s stock market was closed
yesterday for a holiday.  The net loss widened to HK$4.83 billion ($623 million) in
the 12 months ended March 31 from HK$310.8 million a year
earlier, Mongolia Energy said in a June 29 filing to the Hong
Kong stock exchange. The explorer said it accounted for a HK$4.6
billion impairment loss related to its Khushuut coal mine
operations in western Mongolia.  Demand for the company’s coking coal in  China ’s
northwestern region of Xinjiang “will likely increase
significantly” this year and the “Khushuut mine project will
soon be a positive cash-flow contributor to the company,”
Mongolia Energy said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
