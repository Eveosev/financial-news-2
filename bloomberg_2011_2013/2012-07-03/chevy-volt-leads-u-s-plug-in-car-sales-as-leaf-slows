General Motors Co. (GM) ’s Chevrolet Volt
was the best-selling rechargeable auto in the U.S. in the first
half, racing ahead of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s plug-in Prius and
 Nissan Motor Co. (7201) ’s all-electric Leaf hatchback.  Volt sedan deliveries more than tripled to 1,760 in June
from 561 a year earlier and rose 221 percent in the first half
to 8,817, GM said. Toyota sold 695 units of the rechargeable
Prius last month and 4,347 since its March introduction. Leaf
sales fell 69 percent in June to 535 and 19 percent this year to
3,148, as Nissan switches to direct dealer sales of the car.  “On March 1 we went to a more a traditional dealer model.
In doing that we miscalculated the marketing that had to go
behind it,”  Al Castignetti , vice president of Nissan’s North
American sales, said in an interview. The company last year
delivered Leafs to customers on a waiting list, rather than
directly off dealer lots.  Demand for Volts has risen in  California , the main market
for rechargeable autos, after Detroit-based GM modified the
car’s warranty and emissions to qualify it for state rebates and
lone drivers to use carpool lanes. The improvement came after GM
briefly halted Volt assembly this year when sales cooled on news
of battery-pack fires following crash tests.  Separately, the company said yesterday  Tony Posawatz ,
vehicle line director for the Volt since the car’s inception in
2006, had retired, providing no further details.  The 2013 Chevrolet Volt travels 38 miles (61 kilometers) on
a single charge of its lithium-ion battery pack, and has a U.S.
efficiency rating of 98 miles per gallon-equivalent, according
to GM’s website. The Leaf averages 73 miles per charge and the
plug-in Prius can go 15 miles on battery power before running as
a 50-mile-per-gallon hybrid.  The Volt starts at $39,145, and qualifies for a $7,500
federal tax credit. The base model plug-in Prius costs $32,000,
before a $2,500 tax credit. Nissan’s Leaf starts at $35,200,
according to a company  website , before a $7,500 credit.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
