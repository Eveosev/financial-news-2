Slovenia’s central bank urged lenders
in the country, including Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. and  Nova
Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d., to accelerate funding of the
economy or risk seeing companies seeking credit outside the
country.  The central bank “expects banks to speed up lending to the
credit-worthy companies, otherwise there is a danger that such
companies will seek debt directly from abroad,” the Ljubljana-
based  Banka Slovenije  said in an e-mailed statement today.  In May, lending to the non-banking sector of the economy
shrank an annual 4.8 percent on declining loans to both
companies and households, it said.  Slovenian banks, which rely on loans from the  European
Central Bank , are restricting credit to the economy due to
limited wholesale funding and because they are setting aside
record reserves to cover bad loans.  The country’s export-dependent  economy  is on the brink of
its second recession in three years as austerity measures at
home and in  Europe  damp demand.  Net interest income declined 8.1 percent in May from a year
earlier while cost of asset writedowns increased by 27 percent
in the same period, the central bank said. The banking industry
had a total pretax loss of 45.7 million euros ($57.5 million) in
the first five months of 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
