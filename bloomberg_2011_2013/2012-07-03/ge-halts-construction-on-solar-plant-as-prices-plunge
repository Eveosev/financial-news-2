General Electric Co. (GE)  is suspending
construction of a Colorado thin-film solar factory, slated to be
the biggest in the U.S., as prices for the panels tumble amid a
manufacturing-capacity glut.  Work will be halted for at least 18 months, Danielle
Merfeld, the general manager of solar technologies, said in a
telephone interview.  GE, which draws about 30 percent of sales from energy
businesses including wind and solar, will use the delay to
modify the plant’s design and focus on boosting the efficiency
of its solar modules. The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company
announced the $300 million plant in October, with plans to hire
350 workers and begin shipments to customers in 2013.  “Over the past six months, the industry has shifted pretty
rapidly,” Merfeld said. “We’ve seen about a 50 percent price
drop for modules over this period and there’s a lot of unabated
overcapacity out there.”  GE had said the plant, located east of Denver, would make
enough panels annually to power approximately 80,000 U.S. homes,
or about 400 megawatts.  Technology blog GigaOm first reported the suspension
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
