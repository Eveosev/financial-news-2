Spanish olive-oil production may
plunge 37 percent in the year through September 2013 after dry
conditions stressed olive trees and as trees need to recover
following three years of above-average yields, Oil World wrote.  The country’s output of the oil used for cooking and in
salad dressings may slide to 1.1 million metric tons from a
record 1.73 million tons in 2011-12, the Hamburg-based oilseed-
industry researcher wrote in an e-mailed report. Prices fell to
a nine-year low this year after Spanish output jumped at the
same time consumption in  Spain ,  Italy  and  Greece  fell, it said.  “Producers in Spain, Italy and Greece are claiming that
olive-oil production has become unprofitable,” Oil World wrote.
“The prospective severe setback in production will change the
fundamentals and initiate a recovery of olive  oil prices  next
season.”  Spain is the world’s largest olive-oil exporter, shipping
842,451 tons of the oil abroad in 2011 with a value of $2.56
billion, according to data from the International Trade Centre,
a Geneva, Switzerland-based joint agency of the World Trade
Organization and  United Nations . The country accounted for
almost 54 percent of world exports by volume and 46 percent by
value, the data show. Italy is the top importer, the data show.  Spanish olive trees were stressed by unusually dry weather,
particularly in Andalusia, from December to April and again in
June, Oil World wrote.  Extra-virgin olive oil in Spain for delivery in July or
August was $2,172 a ton as of June 28, compared with $1,215 a
ton for sunflower-seed oil in northwest  Europe  and $1,205 a ton
for rapeseed oil, Oil World data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
