Iran  discovered crude reserves near
its western Yadavaran oil field along the border with  Iraq ,
Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi said.  The discovery of the deposits will add as much as 6 billion
barrels to the nation’s recoverable reserves, Qasemi said today,
according to  Shana , the Oil Ministry’s news agency.  The Yadavaran field, which the country shares with Iraq, is
70 kilometers (43 miles) southeast of the city of Ahvaz, Shana

to 154.8 billion barrels of oil from 151 billion following the
