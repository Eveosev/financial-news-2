Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz U.S.
sales, fueled by a new sport-utility vehicle and compact coupe,
rose 7.6 percent in June, furthering the German automaker’s lead
for the year over  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW brand.  Mercedes sold 22,231 cars and SUVs last month, the
Stuttgart, Germany-based automaker said. BMW gained 0.4 percent
to 21,725 compared with the same period last year, the Munich-
based company said in a statement, while  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s
 Lexus  rose 86 percent to 20,022.  “This marks a historic milestone for Mercedes-Benz in the
U.S. market,”  Steve Cannon , chief of Mercedes’s U.S. unit, said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. “We achieved our highest
half-year sales in our 47-year history.”  After six months, Mercedes U.S. sales rose 16 percent to
128,595, to lead BMW by 2,091. BMW, which overtook Lexus last
year to become the top-selling luxury brand in the U.S., sold
126,504 during the first half, an 11 percent gain. BMW beat
Mercedes last year by 2,715 deliveries.  The results don’t include Daimler’s Sprinter vans and Smart
cars and BMW’s Mini brand, all of which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  Mercedes’s introduction of a new M-Class SUV and new C-
Class two-door, along with an updated version of the sedan, all
last year, have helped boost sales.  M-Class sales rose 45 percent to 20,626 through June while
the C-Class, including both the coupe and sedan, gained 26
percent to 37,686. While sales of the M-Class were down in June,
C-Class deliveries surged 41 percent for the month. The
automaker may increase sales further later this year when it
introduces a new version of the GL three-row SUV and an updated
GLK compact SUV.  ‘Outperformed Expectations’  “They certainly outperformed expectations,” said  Jesse Toprak , an industry analyst with TrueCar.com, a  Santa Monica ,
California-based website that tracks auto sales. “They were
very, very aggressive with lease specials, especially C- and E-
Class vehicles. It seems like it was a conscious effort to get
the volume up in the first half.”  Ludwig Willisch, head of BMW’s U.S. unit, has predicted
that the brand will again finish No. 1, aided by the new 3
Series. Sales of the compact car fell 26 percent in June to
6,740. The introduction of the all-wheel-drive version of the
vehicle in the third quarter may increase sales.  “The June numbers continue the solid, consistent growth we
predicted but, most important, the first six months of the year
are setting the stage for even better results ahead,” Willisch
said in a statement yesterday. “Demand is strong though we’ve
been constrained by new model ramp up but supply will soon catch
up in the second half of the year.”  Lexus Rises  BMW and Mercedes vaulted into the No. 1 and No. 2
positions, respectively, last year after Toyota struggled with
parts and vehicle shortages following Japan’s earthquake and
tsunami and flooding in  Asia .  After six months, Lexus sales gained 23 percent to 108,132,
which is slower pace than Toyota’s 2012 target of a 25 percent
increase and 250,000 vehicles sold. The brand may gain sales
from the new ES sedan and RX crossover.  Mercedes, BMW and  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi brand are in
competition for the world luxury-vehicle title. BMW is in the
lead globally through May followed by Audi and Mercedes.  In the U.S., Audi’s sales gained to 26 percent last month
to 12,664, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Audi U.S.
first-half sales rose 17 percent to 65,158, surpassing  General
Motors Co. (GM) ’s Cadillac luxury brand by 2,346 deliveries.  Acura Surges  Cadillac sales rose 12 percent to 12,124 in June while the
brand slid 17 percent to 62,812 during the first half, the
Detroit-based automaker said in a statement.  Both Audi and Cadillac were beat by  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s Acura
brand. Sales of the Tokyo-based company’s luxury brand rose 77
percent to 15,370 last month and 20 percent to 72,936 percent
during the first half, the company said in a statement.  Porsche AG (PAH3) , the Stuttgart-based automaker, sold 3,002
vehicles in the U.S. last month, an 18 percent increase, the
company said in a statement yesterday.  Nissan Motor Co.’s Infiniti sold 10,436 vehicles last
month, a 66 percent gain from a year earlier, the Yokohama,
Japan-based company said in a statement yesterday.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 7,544 Lincolns in June, a 2.5 percent
gain from a year earlier, according to a statement from the
Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker.  Jaguar Land Rover deliveries rose 2 percent to 4,632, the
U.K. brands, owned by Mumbai-based  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , said in an
e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
