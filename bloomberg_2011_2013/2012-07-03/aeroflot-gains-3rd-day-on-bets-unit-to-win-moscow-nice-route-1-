OAO Aeroflot had its longest streak
of gains in a month after  Vedomosti  reported the state-
controlled airline’s biggest unit may join its parent on the
route between Moscow and Nice,  France .  Aeroflot shares advanced 2.3 percent to 44.48 rubles by the
close in Moscow, increasing for a third day.  “Should Russian authorities take such a decision it would
be supportive for Aeroflot, which is currently the only assigned
air carrier on the route,” Georgy Ivanin, a Deutsche Bank AG
analyst, wrote in an e-mailed research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
