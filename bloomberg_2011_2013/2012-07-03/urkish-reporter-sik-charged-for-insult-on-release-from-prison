A Turkish prosecutor has charged
journalist Ahmet Sik with “insulting a public official” after
his release from prison in March, the state-run Anatolia news
agency reported.  The charges carry a sentence of as much as seven years in
prison, Anatolia said.  Sik was released from jail in March after being imprisoned
for 375 days on charges of aiding a plot to overthrow Prime
Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s government. His book, “The
Imam’s Army,” which described how followers of Fethullah Gulen,
a U.S.-based Turkish imam, had allegedly infiltrated the police
force, was confiscated before publication.  “Those who’ve invented these conspiracies, the police who
are carrying them out, the judges and prosecutors, will go into
this jail,” Sik said upon his release from prison, according to
Anatolia’s citation of the remarks for which he’s being charged.
“When they’re in here justice will be done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
