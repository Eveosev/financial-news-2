Wine sales at the world’s five
biggest auction houses fell by a quarter to about $160 million
in the first six months of 2012 as lower prices for top growers
combined with investor caution sparked by the economic slump.  A decline in prices for top vintages of  Chateau Lafite-
Rothschild  since the start of this year contributed to the drop
as demand from Chinese investors focused more on Burgundy.  Lafite extended a slide which started in mid-2011, taking
prices for top vintages such as 2000 and 2005 down more than 25
percent from their peak. A switch in focus by buyers away from
the most expensive  first-growth Bordeaux  wines to second-tier
producers, lesser vintages or rival regions such as Burgundy,
Rhone and  California  contributed.  “The Bordeaux market has come off the highs of a year or
two ago,”  Acker Merrall & Condit  Chief Executive Officer  John Kapon  said in a phone interview from  New York . “It’s
stabilized. Bordeaux’s more susceptible because of the larger
quantities. You won’t find that volatility anywhere else, unless
there’s a major financial crisis.”  Acker led global wine sales in the first half with $46.5
million, including Internet auctions, while Christie’s
International sold about $35 million,  Sotheby’s (BID)  $34.2 million,
Zachys $30.3 million at its live auctions and Hart Davis Hart
Wine Co. $15 million, according to e-mailed figures from each
company.  Asia Ahead  Hong Kong  maintained its lead, accounting for about $75
million, or 47 percent, of global sales by the top five houses.
U.S. sales, split between New York,  Chicago  and California,
accounted for some 35 percent and  Europe  18 percent.  The total of about $160 million sold in the first half by
the top five houses compares with more than $220 million in the
same period a year ago and about $405 million for the whole of
2011, a record year. Wine totaling $350 million was sold at
auction in 2010.  “The change in the market was obviously the decline in the
Bordeaux market,” said Paul Hart, chief executive officer of
Chicago-based  Hart Davis Hart . “That’s the big picture.
Although we saw a decline in dollars, we saw an increase in the
number of new buyers and bidders.”  At an Acker New York summer sale in the Hamptons on June 23
which raised $3.67 million, Burgundy featured as top lot and as
10 of the top 25, with a six-magnum case of 1999 Domaine George
Roumier Musigny fetching $79,950. A 12-bottle case of 1959
 Chateau Petrus  achieved $55,350 and eight other Petrus lots
featured in the top 25.  Romanee-Conti  The top three lots at Sotheby’s two-day London auction on
June 13 and 14 were six bottles of Montrachet 2000 Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti Burgundy, which sold for 17,625 pounds ($27,400),
a double magnum of Chateau Latour 1961 which went for 15,863
pounds and 12 bottles of Cote Rotie La Mouline 1976 Guigal from
the Rhone, which achieved 14,688 pounds.  “There certainly has been diversification,” said  Serena Sutcliffe , Head of International Wine at Sotheby’s in London.
Asked about signs demand in  China  for Bordeaux is cooling as
attention focuses on Burgundy, she said “I think it’s settling
down. In the first years many people were starting collections
from scratch.”  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, which tracks 10 recent
vintages of the five Bordeaux first-growths, has declined 8
percent this year. That contributed to a 30 percent drop in the
past 12 months, having gained 50 percent over the previous 15
months. “The big drop in the first-growths was September to
December” last year, Sutcliffe said.  “Last year was a record and not every year can be a
record,” said Acker’s Kapon. “We expect a good fall season.
The market’s healthy, it’s active.”  (Guy Collins writes about the wine market for Muse, the
