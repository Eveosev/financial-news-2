Czech  bonds  climbed, with yields on
two-year government debt dropping two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 0.906 percent, according to generic prices
compiled by Bloomberg.  The koruna strengthened 0.1 percent to 25.522 per euro by
4:05 p.m. in Prague.  The European Central Bank is forecast by economists to cut
interest rates this week to help curb the debt crisis. Declining
employment figures in the U.S. this week may prompt the Federal
Reserve to initiate fresh stimulus, BNP Paribas SA said.  The Czech two-year yield has dropped 85 basis points this
year while the currency appreciated 0.3 percent. The country is
on public holiday Thursday and Friday of this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
