Barclays Plc (BARC)  released the notes of a
call between former Chief Executive Officer  Robert Diamond  and
Paul Tucker of the Bank of England as lawmakers prepare to
question executives tomorrow.  Tucker told Diamond he had received calls from a number of
unidentified senior Whitehall figures to question why the firm’s
Libor rates were among the highest, according to a copy of the
note posted on the bank’s website.  Tucker said that while he was certain Barclays didn’t need
advice, “that it did not always need to be the case that we
appeared as high as we have recently,” according to the note.  Diamond did not believe he had received any instruction or
that he gave any order to Jerry Del Missier to lower the
lender’s submissions, according to the docuement. Del Missier
concluded that the  Bank of England  had instructed the firm not
to keep Libor so high and instructed rate-setters accordingly.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
