Antonio Esfandiari outlasted 47
rivals to win poker’s biggest payout of $18.3 million in the $1
million buy-in charity tournament at the World Series of Poker.  Esfandiari, a 33-year-old professional from the U.S., beat
British pro Sam Trickett, 25, who bet all his chips and lost on
the final hand at the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino in  Las Vegas .  “It’s called clear intention; I had it,” Esfandiari told
ESPN in a televised interview. “I just knew I was going to win.
I just had to put it out there and believe it, and sometimes it
comes true.”  Trickett collects $10.1 million. Greenlight Capital Inc.
co-founder  David Einhorn , 43, was third, winning $4.35 million.
Einhorn said he’ll donate all of his winnings to the charity
City Year.  Esfandiari was the chip leader yesterday in the final day
of the three-day tournament called the Big One for One Drop. He
started the day with 39.9 million in chips, followed by Trickett,
who had 37 million.  After 48 players paid $1 million each to participate in the
first-time event at the World Series of Poker, those remaining
were guaranteed a return of at least $1.2 million apiece.  Esfandiari’s win topped the $12 million Jamie Gold won in
claiming the no-limit Texas hold’em world championship, known as
the main event, at the 2006  World Series  of Poker. Gold’s win
was the largest in a poker tournament.  One Drop, which is the main beneficiary of the poker event,
fights poverty worldwide by supporting access to water.  To contact the reporter on this story:
