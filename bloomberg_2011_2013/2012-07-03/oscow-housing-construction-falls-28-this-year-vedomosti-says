Moscow housing construction declined
27.8 percent, to 630,000 square meters, in the first half of
2012 from the year-earlier period,  Vedomosti  reported, citing
figures from the Moscow Committee of State Construction
Supervision. The drop was caused by the mayorâ€™s policy of
developing social infrastructure, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
