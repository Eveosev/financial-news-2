ERB - Energias Renovaveis do Brasil,
the Brazilian biomass developer, will start producing energy at
its first wood-fueled cogeneration project by July 2013 for the
chemical producer  Dow Chemical Co. (DOW)   The plant will provide steam to Dowâ€™s Aratu Complex in the
northeastern state of Bahia, Paulo de Tarso Vasconcellos Neto,
director of Sao Paulo-based ERB said yesterday in an e-mail.  The company was awarded 210 million reais ($105 million)
from national development bank Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento
Economico e Social that will be disbursed by Banco Votorantim
SA, Banco Itau BBA and  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) , ERB said yesterday in
a statement.  The 265 million-real project includes about 10,000 hectares
(24,700 acres) of forest plantations and a wood-chipping
facility capable of producing 80 metric tons of biomass fuel an
hour, according to the statement. It will also sell electricity
to the grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
