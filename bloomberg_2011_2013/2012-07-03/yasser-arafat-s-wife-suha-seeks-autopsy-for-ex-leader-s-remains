Suha Arafat, the wife of former
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, said in an interview on Al-
Jazeera television she requested that an autopsy be performed on
her husband’s remains to search for traces of a poisonous
substance.  Arafat, who held the post of chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization since 1969, died in a French hospital in
2004 at the age of 75. He is buried in the West Bank city of
 Ramallah .  To contact the reporter on this story:
