Banks (SX7P)  in the European Union may face
a fresh wave of regulation as lawmakers respond to the Libor
scandal that led to the resignation of the three most senior
managers at  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   Michel Barnier , the 27-nation EU’s financial services
chief, said today that he would examine whether the manipulation
of the London interbank offered rate had exposed “gaps” in the
bloc’s laws. At the same time, legislators in the European
Parliament are seeking to bolster plans unveiled last year to
toughen sanctions against market abuse.  The resignations at Barclays came after the bank was fined
a record 290 million pounds ($455 million) by regulators in the
U.S. and U.K. for attempting to rig Libor. The bank admitted
that it submitted false Libor information to benefit derivatives
trades and bolster its own positions.  Robert Diamond  stepped down today as chief executive
officer of Britain’s second-biggest bank and Jerry Del Missier
quit as chief operating officer, London-based Barclays said in a
statement. Chairman Marcus Agius, 65, will quit once he has
found a replacement for Diamond, who has worked at the bank for
the past 16 years and oversaw its investment banking expansion.  “The lesson which we draw from this case is that it
reinforces the need for ensuring the highest standards of
conduct in the regulation of financial services,” Stefaan De Rynck, a spokesman for Barnier, said in an e-mail. The
revelations show the need to reinforce penalties, including
criminal sanctions, he said.  Tougher Oversight  The Barclays fine provoked renewed calls for tougher
oversight of the financial system and pushed regulatory probes
of interbank lending rates to the top of the political agenda.
De Rynck said Barnier is “following developments” with the
commission’s antitrust department, which has a related probe
into Libor and Euribor rates.  Arlene McCarthy, the lawmaker leading work in the EU
parliament on the draft law on market abuse, said she and
Barnier discussed how the bloc’s rules should be extended to
ensure that manipulation of interbank lending rates is treated
as a criminal offense.  The scandal has “made people more determined that this has
to be a strong set of rules, and we need the member states to
back that,” McCarthy said in a telephone interview from
Strasbourg,  France .  The EU needs to “give regulators the tools they were
asking for to be tougher” on market abuse, she said.  International Investigations  The U.K. Financial Services Authority’s probe is part of a
coordinated set of international investigations into allegations
that interbank rates were rigged during the financial turmoil of
2008.  The probes, which have lasted two years, involve regulators
on three continents, including  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s
antitrust chief. Almunia said last week that the Libor and
Euribor probes were a “top priority.”  “For me it’s classic market manipulation,” McCarthy said.
By pushing up other  interest rates , manipulation of Libor may
have had a “massive impact” on loans to small businesses, and
aggravated the credit crunch, she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
