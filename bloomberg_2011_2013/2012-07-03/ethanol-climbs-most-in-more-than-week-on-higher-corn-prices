Ethanol rose the most in more than a
week as corn jumped because of bad weather.  Futures advanced for a third day to the highest price since
March 16 on concern that hot, dry weather in the Midwest may
hurt corn crops, limiting supply and raising the cost of
producing the biofuel.  Denatured ethanol for July delivery advanced 6.2 cents, or
2.7 percent, to $2.354 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 6.9 percent this year.  A U.S. Agriculture Department report yesterday showed 48
percent of the corn crop was in good or excellent condition as
of July 1, the worst for that date since 1988 and down from 72
percent on June 3.  That pushed ethanol higher, as did speculation that poor
margins may lead producers to idle more output, SCB & Associates
LLC, a Chicago-based brokerage, wrote in a note to clients
today.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) , the third-biggest maker of the
additive, has temporarily halted production at two distilleries,
citing adverse market conditions.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  advanced 9.5
cents, or 4.1 percent, to $2.405 a gallon and in Chicago the
additive gained 9.5 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $2.315, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased 8.5 cents, or 3.7
percent, to $2.38 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel
rose 3.5 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.44.  Corn for December delivery gained 18.75 cents, or 2.9
percent, to $6.745 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
