The European Union executive has so
far failed to propose measures that would put the bloc on a path
to “sustainable prosperity,” according to a coalition of 10
environmental lobby groups, including Greenpeace.  The European Commission, led by its President  Jose Barroso ,
has lacked the courage to push through adequate environmental,
climate, agriculture and energy policies in its second term that
started in 2010 and is due to end in 2014, the groups, which
also include WWF and Health and Environment Alliance, said in a
report published in Brussels today.  “Despite encouraging statements on the need for a smart,
inclusive and sustainable economy, the commission has so far
failed to harness the potential for environmental policies to
create jobs, improve health and reduce energy and resource
use,” the lobbies said.  The report assesses progress in nine EU policy areas with
impact on the environment and reviews the track record of 13
commissioners and the commission president.  The commission got the best grade in the area of climate,
supervised by Commissioner  Connie Hedegaard , where it scored 5.5
out of 10 points. The grade for energy policies, led by
Commissioner Guenther Oettinger, was 4.5 points. Agriculture,
headed by Commissioner Dacian Ciolos, scored 3.5 points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
