OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel (MMK)  rose
the most in five months as the steelmaker terminated its A$554
million ($568 million) bid for  Australia ’s  Flinders Mines Ltd. (FMS) ,
fuelling bets the company won’t boost spending.  The shares climbed 4.9 percent to 9.926 rubles by the close
in Moscow, the biggest jump since Feb. 3.  The Russian steelmaker, known as MMK, dropped its takeover
bid for the Australian mining company late yesterday after a
Russian court postponed a ruling on a minority shareholder’s
effort to block the takeover.  “MMK is a net beneficiary of the break up,” VTB Capital
analysts led by Igor Lebedinets said in an e-mailed research
note today. “The deal might have looked attractive, but the
weakened earnings in 2012 have brought the increasing leverage
into the spotlight.”  MMK saw its takeover offer blocked after minority investor
Elena Egorova won a court decision in March preventing the deal,
claiming it discriminated against her interests as a
shareholder. MMK had agreed to acquire the Adelaide-based iron-
ore producer in November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
