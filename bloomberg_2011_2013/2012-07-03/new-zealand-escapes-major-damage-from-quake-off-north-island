New Zealanders reported little damage
after the  North Island  was shaken late yesterday by the largest
earthquake since the first of a series of devastating temblors
that struck Christchurch in late 2010.  The magnitude 7 earthquake was centered about 60 kilometers
(37 miles) off the east coast of Taranaki province and was 230
kilometers deep, according to  New Zealand ’s  GeoNet  service. The
U.S. Geological Service, which uses different models and
measuring points, assessed it at magnitude 6.2.  Residents throughout the central North Island and in parts
of the South Island felt the temblor, which struck at 10:36 p.m.
Chimneys were damaged in the town of Waverley and small items
fell off the shelves in a supermarket in Wellington, about 170
kilometers southwest from the quake’s center, stuff.co.nz
reported. Train delays were also reported in the capital as
tracks were inspected for damage.  Darfield, east of the  South Island  city of Christchurch,
was struck by a 7.1 quake on Sept. 4, 2010, that was just 10
kilometers deep and caused widespread property damage. Less than
six months later the city was hit by a closer quake that
collapsed buildings and killed 185 people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
