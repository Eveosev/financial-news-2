Chesapeake Energy Corp. (CHK)  and Encana
Corp. are under investigation by the U.S.  Justice Department  for
possible collusion, according to a person familiar with the
probe.  The Justice Department is examining whether the two
companies coordinated to avoid bidding against each other for
land deals in 2010, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the investigation is confidential.  The Justice Department probe was reported earlier by
Reuters. The alleged collusion involved discussions between the
two natural gas companies over how to avoid bidding against each
other for drilling rights in a public land auction in  Michigan 
and in nine prospective deals with private land owners in the
state, according to the report.  Jim Gipson, a spokesman for Oklahoma City-based Chesapeake,
declined to comment. Chesapeake is the second-largest U.S.
natural gas producer.  Belinda de Wolde, a spokeswoman for Calgary-based Encana,
said she couldn’t comment on the Justice Department probe
mentioned in the story.  “I can tell you Encana takes compliance with all laws very
seriously and, as previously stated, our board chairman has
initiated an investigation of this matter,” de Wolde said in an
e-mail.  Encana,  Canada ’s largest gas producer, said on June 25 that
it began an internal review of e-mails from 2010 between Encana
and Chesapeake executives concerning bidding strategies for
Michigan drilling rights.  To contact the reporter on this story:
