Jeremy Lin withdrew from the team of
National Basketball Association players that will practice
against the U.S. Olympic squad ahead of the London Games because
of his status as a free agent.  Lin, a Harvard University graduate, is a restricted free
agent after a season in which he went from bench warmer to the
 New York  Knicks’ starting point guard. NBA players can’t sign
new contracts until July 11, the last of six days the USA men’s
select team will train with the national team in Las Vegas.  “It was such an incredible honor to be selected, but I
have withdrawn my name from the team because of my status as a
free agent,” said Lin, who averaged 14.6 points and 6.2 assists
last season. “I hope to have the opportunity to participate
with USA Basketball at some point in the future.”  The Knicks can match any offer Lin receives from another
team.  USA Basketball also said yesterday that Boston Celtics
center Greg Stiemsma withdrew from the select team because of a
foot injury. Members of the U.S. team that will scrimmage
against the Olympic squad include DeJuan Blair and Kawhi Leonard
of the San Antonio Spurs, DeMarcus Cousins of the Sacramento
Kings, Kyrie Irving of the  Cleveland Cavaliers  and  John Wall  of
the Washington Wizards.  The U.S. Olympic men’s basketball team, which includes
LeBron James of the Miami Heat and  Kobe Bryant  of the  Los
Angeles Lakers , won the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
