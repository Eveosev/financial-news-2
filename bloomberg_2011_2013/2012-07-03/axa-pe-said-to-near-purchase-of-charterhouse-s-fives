Axa Private Equity, the buyout firm
owned by French insurer  Axa SA (CS) , is nearing a deal to purchase
 Fives  jointly with the management of the French engineering
company, four people with knowledge of the matter said.  Paris-based Axa Private Equity and Fives’s management are
are close to completing an offer to buy the company from
Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP, said the people, who asked
not to be identified because an agreement hasn’t been signed.
The deal may value Fives at more than 1 billion euros ($1.26
billion), two of them said.  Charterhouse, a London-based buyout firm, bought into the
company formerly known as Fives-Lille for 450 million euros in
2006, according to the firm’s  website . Fives, based in Paris,
designs production lines and plant facilities. Axa Private
Equity has competed against PAI Partners, Cinven Ltd. and BC
Partners Ltd. for the company, in a process largely handled by
Fives’s own management, which owns and will keep a large if not
controlling stake, the people said.  Representatives of Axa Private Equity and Charterhouse
declined to comment on the process. A spokeswoman for Fives
couldn’t immediately comment.  Fives had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization of 99 million euros last year, up 15 percent from
the previous year, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
