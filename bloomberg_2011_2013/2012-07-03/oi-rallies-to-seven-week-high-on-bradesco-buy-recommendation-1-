Oi SA (OIBR4)  rose to a seven-week high after
 Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ’s brokerage raised its recommendation to the
equivalent of buy on expectations for improved revenue and a new
dividend distribution plan.  Shares gained 6 percent to 9.01 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo, the highest since May 14. The benchmark Bovespa index
rose 2 percent.  “The market is underestimating the company’s capacity to
stop deterioration of revenues, which could lead to a positive
surprise,” Luis Azevedo and Tales Freire, analysts at Bradesco,
wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday. “The company is
also implementing a bold dividend distribution plan, which we
believe should continue to support the stock price.”  The fixed- and mobile-telecommunications company said in a
regulatory filing in May that net income attributed to
controlling shareholders was 345.2 million reais ($171 million).
The average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was
for adjusted profit of 152.8 million reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
