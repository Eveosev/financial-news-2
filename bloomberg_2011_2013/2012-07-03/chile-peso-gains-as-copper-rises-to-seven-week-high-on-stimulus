Chile’s peso gained as copper, the
country’s chief export, reached a seven-week high on speculation
central banks may add more stimulus to the global economy.  The peso rose 0.7 percent to 497.12 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:52 a.m. in Santiago.  The  European Central Bank  will cut its main  interest rate 
to an all-time low this week, according to a Bloomberg News
survey, and a state-owned newspaper in China said the reserve
requirement for banks should fall. Copper reached the highest
since May 15 on the Comex in New York as commodities gained.  Yesterday was a market holiday in Chile.  “Today copper is pretty strong and the market has reacted
positively to the U.S. factories data, too,” said Andres de la
Cerda, a money markets trader at Bice Inversiones in Santiago.  Orders placed at U.S. factories rose in May for the first
time in three months, the Commerce Department said today.  Copper makes up half of  Chile ’s exports. The price of the
metal drives the volume of dollars entering the country and the
value of the peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
