Canada will exempt certain memory
cards from a levy charged to consumers to compensate copyright
holders, Industry Minister Christian Paradis said, denying an
industry group’s request.  The federal government won’t impose levies on microSD
memory cards, which are removable devices that can be used to
store music on mobile phones, Paradis said today in an e-mailed
statement.  “Placing a new fee on devices with removable memory cards,
such as BlackBerrys and smart phones, would increase costs for
Canadian families and impact the adoption of the latest
technologies,” Paradis said in the statement.  Canadian consumers pay a levy on blank audio recording
media such as compact discs, and the money is distributed to
music rights holders.  The Canadian Private Copying Collective, an industry
organization that collects the fee and distributes it to rights
holders, had  proposed  that the levy be extended to microSD
memory drives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
