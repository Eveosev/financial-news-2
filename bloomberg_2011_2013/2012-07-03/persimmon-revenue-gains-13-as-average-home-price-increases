Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s largest
homebuilder by market value, said first-half revenue climbed
about 13 percent as the company sold a greater proportion of
family houses, raising the average price of its homes.  Revenue increased to about 805 million pounds ($1.3
billion), the York, England-based company said today in a
statement. Persimmon completed 4,712 homes compared with 4,439 a
year earlier and the average price was about 7 percent higher at
171,400 pounds.  U.K. homebuilders have boosted revenue and share prices
amid tight mortgage lending and stagnating property values after
reducing sales volume and increasing margins. Persimmon has
gained 30 percent in  London  trading in the last 12 months, the
most in the Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index, which rose 14
percent.  “We’re seeing the must-move people,” Chief Executive
Officer Mike Farley said in an interview. “There is that
underlying hardcore number of people who need to move or need to
acquire their first house. You’ve got to live somewhere.”  Persimmon gained as much as 1.9 percent to 647 pence, the
highest in more than two months. The shares were up 1.6 percent
at 645 pence at 8:56 a.m., giving the homebuilder a market value
of almost 2 billion pounds.  Below Capacity  Persimmon expects an underlying operating margin of more
than 11.5 percent compared with 9 percent a year ago. Though the
company has the capacity to build around 14,000 homes annually,
it plans to construct fewer than 10,000 because of restricted
lending, Farley said.  “The drag on the market is the lack of affordable
mortgages,” he said in the interview. “Until that issue is
fully resolved, the industry will be constrained on its
volumes.”  Britons repaid more mortgage debt than they borrowed in May
for the first time in at least 15 years as consumers sought to
improve their finances, the British Bankers’ Association said
June 27.  House prices  in the U.K. stopped rising in June for the
first time in four months as economic uncertainty and a seasonal
slowdown weighed on the market. Farley and executives at rivals
 Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV)  and Berkeley Group Plc said the London
2012 Olympics may stifle home purchases in the next quarter. The
competition starts July 27 and the Paralympics finishes on Sept.
