Viswanathan Shankar, chief executive
officer for the  Middle East , Africa, Europe and the Americas at
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , comments on the use of the  yuan  in
international trade and the impact of the European crisis on the
bank’s business. He spoke in an interview in Seoul today.  On the yuan’s use in international trade  “Ninety percent of global trade is actually paid in two
currencies, the U.S. dollar and euro. The renminbi has come up
very, very fast and it now accounts for less than 3 or 4 percent
of global trade. Still, most use of renminbi is happening in
Asia and to some extent in Europe and the Middle East. It’s not
yet happening in Africa. We haven’t yet seen a rampant use of
 renminbi  for trade. It’s too early to predict, but it’s going to
go up.”  On tighter financing for global projects:  “Western banks excluding Standard Chartered and a few
others are becoming capital constrained and dollar constrained.
You’re clearly seeing a reduction in the amount of liquidity
available for project financing. So financing is going to be a
big driver of the ability to execute large projects.”  On how Standard Chartered is benefiting from the Europe crisis:  “Our businesses in Europe and the Americas are actually
growing in double digits because more and more European and
American companies need Standard Chartered as they do businesses
in Asia, the Middle East and  Africa . This is not about us
helping them do business in Europe and the U.S., it’s about
helping them in their growth markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
