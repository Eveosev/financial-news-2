Wimbledon suspended play on outside
tennis courts as a steady drizzle made the grass too slippery.  The women’s quarterfinal between Poland’s Agnieszka
Radwanska and  Maria Kirilenko  of Russia was halted as was the
fourth round men’s match between Mardy Fish of the U.S. and
France’s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.  The quarterfinal between Serena Williams and defending
champion Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic is continuing under
the roof on Centre Court. The American won the first set.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
