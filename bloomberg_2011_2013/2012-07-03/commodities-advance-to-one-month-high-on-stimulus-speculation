Commodities advanced to the highest
level in more than a month on expectations that central banks in
the U.S.,  Europe  and China will ease monetary policy to spur
growth, boosting demand for raw materials.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index gained as much as 2.2
percent to 610.58, the highest intraday level since May 30, and
was at 610.48 as of 1:50 p.m. in London. Crude oil gained as
much as 2.8 percent, copper rallied to the most since May 22 and
gold traded at the highest in almost two weeks.  The  European Central Bank  is forecast by economists to cut
 interest rates  this week to help curb the debt crisis while a
state-owned newspaper in China said the time is ripe for a
reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for major banks.
Declining employment figures this week may prompt the  Federal
Reserve  to initiate fresh stimulus, BNP Paribas SA said.  “The mood on the financial markets has generally been
bright since the end of last week,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , an
analyst at VTB Group in London, said today in an e-mailed note.
“Gold is reaping the benefit of market expectations for further
monetary easing around the globe to stimulate economic growth.”  Today’s commodity rally exceeded the 0.3 percent gain in
the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities, and trimmed this
year’s loss to 5.5 percent. Prices of raw materials from oil to
copper soared 92 percent during the time when the Fed bought
$2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of economic stimulus from
December 2008 to June 2011.  Oil for August delivery rose 2.7 percent to $85.97 a barrel
on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Three-month copper climbed
as much as 2.5 percent to $7,815 a metric ton on the  London 
Metal Exchange.  Bullion for immediate delivery rose as much as 1.2 percent
to $1,616.75 an ounce, the most since June 20, and last traded
at $1,614.57 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
