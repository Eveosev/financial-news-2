Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC)  processed
6.9 percent less oil in the second quarter than it previously
anticipated after shutting the crude unit at the Robinson
refinery early for a planned maintenance turnaround.  Marathon ran 90,000 barrels a day less oil across its six-
refinery system than the 1.3 million it had forecast, the
company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The reduction reflects a crude unit turnaround at
the Robinson plant that’s expected to be completed in mid July,
Robert Calmus, a company spokesman, said by telephone.  Total throughput in the second quarter was about 60,000
barrels a day less than a predicted 1.4 million, Marathon said
in the 8-K filing. The work at Robinson affected total
throughput slightly less than crude because some units at the
refinery are still processing fuel, said Calmus, who is based at
the company’s headquarters in Findlay,  Ohio .  The Robinson refinery has a capacity of 215,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The plant shut
multiple units around June 7 for the planned turnaround, Shane Pochard, a Marathon spokesman in Findlay, said in an e-mail that
day. The work was initially scheduled to begin this month,
Marathon said in the 8-K filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
