France’s two-week-old Socialist
government will announce today a mix of tax increases and
spending cuts, seeking to meet deficit-reduction goals and avoid
a bond-market punishment.  The plan will reverse wealth-tax cuts and breaks for
employers pushed through by former President  Nicolas Sarkozy .
President  Francois Hollande  has promised measures, such as a 75-
percent tax rate for income of more than 1 million euros ($1.26
million), and special taxes for banks and  oil companies .  France’s national auditor said July 2 that the government
needs between 6 billion euros and 10 billion euros ($7.5-$12.5
billion) in savings this year to meet its 2012 target of a
deficit equal to 4.5 percent of economic output. For next year,
it needs to find 33 billion euros in savings to hit its target
of 3 percent. Hollande has delayed the eventual goal of a
balanced budget to 2017 from Sarkozy’s 2016.  “Debt is a question of sovereignty,” Prime Minister Jean- Marc Ayrault told parliament yesterday. “An indebted  France  is
a dependent France: dependent on rating agencies, dependent on
financial markets.”  France pays about 2.54 percent to borrow for 10 years,
compared with 6.21 percent for  Spain  and 5.61 percent for  Italy .
The spread between French and German bond yields is at about 100
basis points, down from more than 140 points in mid-May.  Today’s “rectifying budget” for 2012 will be announced
after a 10 a.m. cabinet meeting.  Shrinking Spending  The government has already signaled that spending will need
to be cut. For its 2013-2015 budget, the government plans to
reduce the number of civil-service jobs by 2.5 percent annually
and reduce operating costs -- including car fleets -- by 10
percent next year, Le Figaro reported last month.  Ayrault has issued orders to all ministries except
education and justice to cut spending by 2.5 percent
immediately.  Other efforts are more symbolic. Hollande cut salaries for
himself and for ministers by a third at his first cabinet
meeting, fulfilling an election promise. French ministers will
now be paid 9,940 euros a month instead of the 14,200 euros
under the previous president.  Hollande takes the train to European Union summits in
Brussels; Sarkozy used to fly. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius
will fly commercial to  Japan  and  China  next week, whereas his
predecessor used a government Falcon for such trips.  The wine delivered yesterday at Matignon, Ayrault’s
workplace and residence, was Domaine de Sauvageonne, from the
southern region of Languedoc, retailing for about 10 euros per
bottle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
