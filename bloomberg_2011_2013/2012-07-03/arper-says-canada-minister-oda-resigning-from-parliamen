Minister Bev Oda, who faced criticism over her travel expenses,
said today she will resign from Parliament July 31.  Oda advised Prime Minister  Stephen Harper  two weeks ago
that she will step down as the lawmaker representing the
district of Durham, Ontario, she said in a  statement  on her
website.  Oda was criticized by opposition lawmakers since it was
revealed in April that while on a business trip she rejected
staying at a luxury hotel in  London  and opted to stay at one
that was more than twice as expensive.  “Bev has made a significant contribution to her riding,
her province and her country since her election to Parliament in
2004,” Harper said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
