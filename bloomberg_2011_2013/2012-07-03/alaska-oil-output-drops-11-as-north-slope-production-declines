Alaska crude-oil production dropped
11 percent in June from a year earlier, the largest drop in
almost a year, after Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., operator of
the cross-state pipeline system, conducted maintenance and as
output from wells declined.  Production  averaged  516,871 barrels a day last month, down
from 581,297  a year earlier , the biggest decline since output
fell 15 percent from July 2010 to July 2011, the state
Department of Revenue said on its website. The pipeline
delivered 570,770 barrels a day in  May .  Production peaked for the month at 592,381 barrels on June
12 and fell to a low of 380,893 on June 2, when crews scheduled
valve testing.  “Any fluctuations in throughput are due to planned
maintenance,”  Michelle Egan , a spokeswoman at Alyeska, said in
an e-mailed response to questions.  Output on the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) Trans-Alaska crude
system has declined annually since 2002 as falling yield from
existing wells hasn’t been replaced, according to the state tax
division. Crude-oil output from  Prudhoe Bay  averaged 305,132
barrels per day in June, down from 324,919 in May, the state
said.  Alaskan North Slope crude  strengthened $3.60 to $102.85 a
barrel, $15.50 a barrel above the U.S. benchmark West Texas
Intermediate at 11:41 a.m.  New York  time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories of the feedstock at the Valdez marine terminal
averaged 4.7 million barrels last month, ranging from 3.84
million on June 16 to 5.49 million June 1, according to the
revenue department.  Alyeska is owned by BP Pipelines (Alaska), ConocoPhillips
Transportation Alaska, ExxonMobil Pipeline Co., Unocal Pipeline
Co., and Koch Alaska Pipeline Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
