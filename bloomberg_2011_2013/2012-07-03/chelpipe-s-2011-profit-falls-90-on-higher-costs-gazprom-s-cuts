ChelPipe, the Russian pipemaker
controlled by Andrey Komarov, said profit fell 90 percent last
year as OAO Gazprom cut large-diameter pipe purchases and costs
rose.  Net income was 496 million rubles ($15 million) compared
with 4.78 billion rubles a year earlier, ChelPipe said in a
statement on its  website . Revenue rose 33 percent to 114 billion
rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
