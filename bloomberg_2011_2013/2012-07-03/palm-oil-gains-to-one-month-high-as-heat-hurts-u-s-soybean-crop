Palm oil  climbed for a third day to
the highest level in more than a month on concern that hot, dry
weather in the U.S. may have hurt crops, reducing global
cooking-oil supplies.  The September-delivery contract rose 1.2 percent to close
at 3,124 ringgit ($991) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest price for the most-active contract since
May 29. Futures have rebounded 10 percent since reaching an
eight-month low of 2,838 ringgit on June 14.  About 45 percent of  soybeans  were rated good or excellent
as of July 1, down from 53 percent last week and 66 percent a
year earlier, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said yesterday.
Little or no rain has fallen in most of the Great Plains and
Midwest in the past week, National Weather Service data show.  “It all boils down to the weather,” said Donny Khor,
senior vice president for futures and options at  OSK Holdings
Bhd. (OSK)  “As long as the  weather forecasts  continue to be hot and
dry, or the rain may not be as much as people expect, this is
likely to continue to support the markets.”  The weather will stress corn and soybeans over at least the
next five to seven days, with crops in Missouri, Illinois, and
Indiana at most risk, according to Telvent DTN Inc.  Soybeans for November delivery gained 1.2 percent to $14.55
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. December-delivery
 soybean oil  rose 0.8 percent to 53.46 cents per pound. Palm oil
and soybean oil are used in foods and fuels.  Shipment Estimates  Price gains were also due to the “good” export estimates
for last month, Khor said. Malaysia’s shipments rose 4.9 percent
to 1.45 million tons in June from a month earlier, Intertek said
June 30. Exports gained 9.7 percent to 1.46 million tons last
month, Societe Generale de Surveillance said yesterday.  Imports by  China , the biggest cooking-oil user, may gain
1.5 percent to 5.8 million tons in the year to Sept. 30 from a
year ago, state-owned researcher Grain.gov.cn said in an e-
mailed report today.  MMTC Ltd. (MMTC) , a state-run Indian trader, invited bids to
import 22,000 tons of refined, bleached and deodorized palm
olein from Malaysia or Indonesia for delivery by July 25.
Bidders have until July 11 to tender, MMTC said today.  Palm oil for January delivery rose 1 percent to close at
8,176  yuan  ($1,287) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil for delivery the same month climbed 0.8 percent to
end at 9,710 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
