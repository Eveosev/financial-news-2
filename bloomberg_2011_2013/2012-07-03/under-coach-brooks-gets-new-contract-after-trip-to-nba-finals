The  Oklahoma City  Thunder gave coach
Scott Brooks a multiyear contract extension following a season
in which they made the National Basketball Association Finals.  Brooks, 46, has a 174-125 record since taking over as
Oklahoma City’s coach during the 2008-09 season. The Thunder
have 152 wins under Brooks over the past three years and have
reached the playoffs each season, winning two division titles.  “Continuing with Scott as our head coach is extremely
significant for the future of our organization,” Thunder
General Manager Sam Presti said in a statement. “He’s been
integral to our success and we have a deep appreciation for his
tireless dedication to our players’ development.”  The Thunder didn’t disclose terms of Brooks’s contract.  Brooks received the NBA’s Coach of the Year award after his
first full season with the Thunder in 2009-10, when Oklahoma
City had a 50-32 record a year after going 22-47. The Thunder
went 47-19 last season and won the Western Conference title
before losing to the  Miami Heat  in the NBA Finals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
