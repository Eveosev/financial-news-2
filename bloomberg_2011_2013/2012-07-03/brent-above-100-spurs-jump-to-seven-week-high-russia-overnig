Russian stocks traded in  New York 
rose to the highest level in seven weeks as  OAO Sberbank (SBRCY)  rallied
after  Brent crude  climbed above $100 on prospects central banks
in Europe will ease monetary policy.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US 14 Index (RUS14BN)  of Russian companies
traded in New York advanced 2.3 percent to 91.40 yesterday.
Futures expiring in September on the dollar-denominated RTS
index lost 0.3 percent to 139,900. Sberbank, the biggest lender
in eastern Europe, increased to the highest level since May 15
while OAO Gazprom, Russia’s natural gas export monopoly, climbed
for a third day.  CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  tumbled to a three-year low as
UBS AG cut its recommendation on the shares.  Brent for August settlement traded above $100 a barrel for
the first time since June 11 on speculation the  European Central
Bank  and the  Bank of England  will announce steps tomorrow that
will ease monetary policy and spur growth in the countries that
are the biggest buyers of Russia’s natural resources. The
world’s largest energy exporter got almost 50 percent of budget
revenue from oil and gas sales last year.  “The move for Brent does make the picture look better,”
Mattias Westman, managing director of Prosperity Capital
Management, the largest Russia-focused equity investor with
about $4 billion under management, said in a phone interview
from London yesterday. “The risk of a terrible scenario in
Europe seems to be receding, and the ECB seems ready to do
something that could embolden markets.”  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S. exchange-
traded fund that holds Russian shares, surged to the highest
level in two months, adding 3.3 percent to $27.34. The RTS
Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the index
futures, rose for a second day, increasing 2.4 percent to 33.70.  ‘A Relief’  Sberbank rose 4.4 percent to $11.40, extending its gain to
13 percent since European leaders agreed on June 29 to ease
repayment rules for troubled euro zone banks. Euro-area policy
eased repayment rules for emergency loans to Spanish banks last
week and relaxed conditions on potential help for  Italy .  Sberbank gained 3.7 percent on the  Micex (INDEXCF)  to 90.93 rubles,
or the equivalent of $2.83. One American depositary receipt
represents four ordinary shares.  Gazprom climbed 3.8 percent to $9.88 as the company agreed
to a price deal with EON, its largest European Union customer.
Gazprom is seeking to keep more than 25 percent of the region’s
gas market. Shares in Moscow rose 2.4 percent to 159 rubles, or
the equivalent of $4.95. One ADR represents two ordinary shares.  “The agreement does not appear to be very different from
what was expected, but for some it was a relief just to know
what it would be,” Westman said.  ‘Weaker-Than-Expected’  CTC Media tumbled 7 percent to $7.42, the lowest since
April 2009. UBS cut its recommendation on the shares to neutral
from buy and reduced its price estimate, citing decreased
audience share combined with “weaker-than-expected” television
advertising growth.  Russian equities may get a boost as shareholders reinvest a
portion of the approximately $8.4 billion in dividend payouts
they are scheduled to receive by the end of August,  Renaissance
Capital  said in a July 3 report. An additional $5 billion to $6
billion in stock buybacks by Russian companies may also send
stocks higher, Milena Ivanova-Venturini, an analyst at
Renaissance, wrote in the note.  The 30-stock Micex Index gained 2.5 percent to 1,437.44
yesterday, a two-month high.  Oil Surges  Commodities rose to a five-week high, led by energy, as
crude for August delivery surged 4.7 percent to settle at $87.66
a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Brent crude for
August settlement increased 3.4 percent to $100.68 a barrel on
the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. Urals crude,
Russia’s chief export blend, gained 4.3 percent to $99.98.  The  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot index  of 24 raw materials
rose 3.4 percent to 618.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  Index advanced 0.6 percent to 1,374.02 as
orders placed with U.S. factories  rose  in May for the first time
in three months. The 0.7 percent increase in bookings followed a
revised 0.7 percent drop in the prior month, the Commerce
Department said yesterday in  Washington .  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
was unchanged at HK$4.50 in  Hong Kong  as of the city’s noon
trading break. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 0.4 percent
today amid speculation Chinese and European central bankers will
ease monetary policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
