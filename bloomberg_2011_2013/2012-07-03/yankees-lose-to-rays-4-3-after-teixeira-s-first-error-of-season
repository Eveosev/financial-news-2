Mark Teixeira ’s first error of the
season helped the Tampa Bay Rays score the go-ahead run in a 4-3
victory over the New York Yankees.  The Rays scored two runs in the bottom of the seventh
inning to erase a 3-2 deficit last night in St. Petersburg,
Florida. Brooks Conrad drove in the tying run with a pinch-hit
double and then scored on the fielding miscue by Teixeira, a
four-time Gold Glove award winner as the best defensive first
baseman in the American League.  It was the Rays’ eighth straight home win over the Yankees,
who still lead the AL Eastern Division with a 48-31 record.
Tampa Bay had lost six of its previous seven games entering the
three-game series at Tropicana Field.  The Yankees opened a 2-0 first-inning lead last night
before B.J. Upton and  Carlos Pena  hit solo home runs off pitcher
 Freddy Garcia , who allowed five hits over 5 1/3 innings in his
first start for New York since April 28.  Matt Moore  picked up the win for the Rays, allowing three
runs on nine hits over seven innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
