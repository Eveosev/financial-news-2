Dresser-Rand Group Inc. (DRC) , an equipment
maker for oil and natural-gas producers, bought patents,
trademarks and other intellectual property from Energy Storage &
Power LLC for an undisclosed price.  The purchase covers technology associated with compressed
air energy storage, Houston-based Dresser-Rand said in a
statement today. The company is also retaining Michael Nakhamkin, owner of Energy Storage, as a consultant.  The acquisition will complement Dresser-Randâ€™s existing
compressed air technologies and enable it to provide a full
range of system sizes for customers, according to the statement.
The systems use off-peak power to compress and store air. When
released, the air drives a turbine to generate power.  It can provide backup power for intermittent renewable
energy sources like solar and wind power, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
