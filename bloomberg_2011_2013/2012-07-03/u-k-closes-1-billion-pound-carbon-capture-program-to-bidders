The U.K. closed a 1 billion-pound
($1.6 billion) carbon-capture support program to bidders after
receiving “significant interest” in the past three months.  The government will review each bid before publishing
details in the next few weeks, the Department of Energy and
Climate Change said today in an e-mailed statement. The decision
on which projects to fund will follow in the autumn.  The U.K. is seeking to develop technology to gather  carbon
emissions  for underground storage that will be commercially
viable by the 2020s. Bidding for the program began on April 3.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
