A city in southwest  China  halted
construction of a  Sichuan Hongda Co. (600331)  copper plant, officials
said yesterday, the same day that police fired tear gas at
protesters who argued the project would pollute the environment.  Construction was stopped because the public “doesn’t
understand, isn’t clear and isn’t supportive” of the project,
according to the  statement  on the Shifang city government’s
website.  Clashes between demonstrators and police on July 2 hurt at
least 13 protesters and “many” officers, the state-run
People’s Daily said  on its website  yesterday. The protests were
broken up with tear gas and stun grenades as attacks on police
worsened, the report said.  Trading of Sichuan Hongda’s shares was suspended in
Shanghai today, the  Shanghai Stock Exchange  said today. The
company needs to clarify media reports, the statement said,
without providing details.  Shares of Sichuan Hongda have fallen 3.7 percent so far
this year.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
