Barclays Plc (BARC)  said Jerry del Missier,
the bank’s newly appointed chief operating officer and 15-year
veteran, resigned.  Del Missier, 50, who took the job on June 22 after being
co-head of the bank’s investment banking unit with Ricci Rich,
leaves on the same day as his boss, Chief Executive Officer
 Robert Diamond , the London-based bank said in a statement today.  Barclays was hit by a record 290 million-pound ($455
million) fine last week for rigging the benchmark  interest rate 
for more than $360 trillion of securities. Diamond yesterday
defied pressure to quit, pledging to implement the findings of a
review into how the bank sets the London interbank offered rate.
U.K. regulators are weighing whether to start a criminal probe
into Libor fixing.  “His many contributions to the firm were critical to why
Barclays was able to weather the extreme market turbulence of
the credit crisis as well as we did,” Chairman Marcus Agius
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
