Gold climbed to the highest price in
two weeks amid speculation that central banks will take more
action to spur growth, boosting demand for the metal as an
inflation hedge.  Reports showed yesterday that euro-area manufacturing
output contracted for an 11th straight month in June and
manufacturing in the U.S. unexpectedly shrank. European Central
Bank officials are forecast to cut their main  interest rate  to
an all-time low on July 5, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of economists.  “People are expecting some form of easing both in the U.S.
and Europe,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated
Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “The chatter is growing louder.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 1.5 percent to settle
at $1,621.80 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
after climbing to $1,625.70, the highest for a most-active
contract since June 19.  The metal is up 3.5 percent this year. Prices surged 70
percent from the end of December 2008 to June 2011 as the
 Federal Reserve  kept borrowing costs at a record low and bought
$2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called quantitative
easing.  Silver futures for September delivery gained 2.8 percent to
$28.28 an ounce on the Comex. Earlier, prices touched $28.445,
the highest since June 20.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery advanced 2.3 percent to $1,491.40 an ounce,
rising for three straight sessions. Palladium futures for
September delivery jumped 3.6 percent to $598.90 an ounce.  Comex floor trading will be closed tomorrow for the
Independence Day holiday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
