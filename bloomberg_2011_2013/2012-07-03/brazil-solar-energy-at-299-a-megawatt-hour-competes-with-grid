Producing power from rooftop solar
panels in  Brazil  costs less than electricity sold by 10 of the
country’s 63 power distributors, according to the national
energy agency Empresa de Pesquisa Energetica.  Electricity from a typical 5 kilowatt system costs about
602 reais ($299) a megawatt-hour, EPE said today in a  report .
Distributors charge 240 reais to 709 reais for residential
power.  That makes power from rooftop solar systems competitive
with electricity from companies including  Ampla Energia e
Servicos SA  and Cia. Energetica de Minas Gerais.  “There already exist situations where competitiveness is
clearly present,” EPE said.  Costs for solar energy fall to 586 reais a megawatt-hour if
homeowners use a government credit program called Proesco to buy
panels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
