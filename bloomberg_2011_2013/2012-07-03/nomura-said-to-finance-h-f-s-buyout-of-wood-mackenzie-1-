Nomura Holdings Inc. has underwritten
the financing backing Hellman & Friedman LLC’s buyout of energy
advisory firm  Wood Mackenzie , according to two people with
knowledge of the matter.  The buyout will be financed by 565 million pounds ($888
million) of loans, including 180 million pounds of mezzanine
debt, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the deal is private.  Sankaty Advisors LLC, a unit of Bain Capital LLC, and an
existing lender to Wood Mackenzie, is the leading investor in
the new mezzanine debt, the people said. It was joined by
Noonday Asset Management LLP and MezzVest, the people said. The
deal is Sankaty’s second mezzanine investment in  Europe  in the
past 12 months after funding HgCapital’s acquisition of IRIS
Accountancy Solutions in December, said the people.  Charlotte  McMullen, a spokeswoman in  London  for Hellman &
Friedman, declined to comment on the debt financing.  Wood Mackenzie said today Hellman & Friedman agreed to take
a 63 percent stake in the Edinburgh-based company while
Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP will retain a 13 percent
share. The transaction values Wood Mackenzie at 1.1 billion
pounds, according to an e-mailed statement.  Charterhouse took control of Wood Mackenzie in 2009 in a
deal that valued the company at 553 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
