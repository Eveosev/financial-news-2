The U.S. military today will resume
flying specially equipped C-130 cargo planes that are used to
help fight fires, a day after suspending operations because of a
plane crash in  South Dakota .  The decision, announced by the U.S. Northern Command in a
statement, means that seven planes that had been fighting fires
in  Colorado , Wyoming,  Montana  and South Dakota can resume their
work.  The planes are equipped with a pressurized tank system that
can expel water or fire retardants within seconds over an area a
quarter of a mile long by 100 feet wide, according to Northern
Command, which is based in  Colorado Springs , Colorado.  One of the planes, from the 145th Airlift Wing of the North
Carolina Air National Guard, crashed July 1 while assisting with
the White Draw Fire in South Dakota. The cause of that crash is
under investigation.  The planes typically travel with a crew of six, according
to Northern Command. The North Carolina Air National Guard plans
to announce the names of those killed in the crash today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
