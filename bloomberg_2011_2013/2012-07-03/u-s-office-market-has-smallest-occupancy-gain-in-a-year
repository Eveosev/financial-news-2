The U.S.  office market  had its
smallest increase in net occupancies in a year in the second
quarter as job growth slowed,  Reis Inc. (REIS)  said.  Net occupancies climbed by 4.14 million square feet
(384,000 square meters) in the second quarter, the least since
2.73 million square feet was added a year earlier, according to
the New York-based property-research firm. The gain in
occupancies, the sixth in a row, compared with 6 million square
feet in the first quarter.  Effective rents, or what tenants pay after landlord
incentives such as a free month are included, rose to $22.72 per
square foot from $22.66 in the first quarter and $22.27 a year
earlier, Reis said. The national office vacancy rate of 17.2
percent was unchanged from the first quarter and down from 17.5
percent a year earlier.  Demand for  office space  has slowed amid an anemic economic
recovery. U.S. employers added 69,000 workers in May, the fewest
in a year, pushing up the  jobless rate  to 8.2 percent from 8.1
percent, according to the Labor Department.  “The pace of improvement remains slow, keeping rents
moored near 2007 levels,” Ryan Severino, senior economist at
Reis, said in today’s report. “Markets where five-year lease
terms are common could face substantial rollover risk this
year” as leases expire.  A dearth of construction has helped rents and occupancies.
A net total of 4.2 million square feet of office space was
completed in the three months ended June 30, down from 5.6
million square feet in the first quarter and 4.6 million square
feet a year earlier, according to research firm  CoStar Group
