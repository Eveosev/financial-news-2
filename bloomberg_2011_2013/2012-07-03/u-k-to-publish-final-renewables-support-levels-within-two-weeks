The U.K. government will publish the
conclusion of a review of the levels of support renewable energy
generators receive within two weeks, a minister said.  Minister of State for Energy and Climate Change  Charles Hendry  said the government will announce the results of a review
of the renewable obligation certificate program before
parliament breaks for summer in two weeks.  “We really have to transform the whole of the  electricity
market  over the next few years,” Hendry said today at a
conference in London. “We need to restate collectively the role
of renewables within that” as the government seeks to
deliver energy security from low-carbon sources in a way that
minimizes costs for consumers, he said.  The U.K. proposed the new levels, or bands, for different
clean technologies in October. The government received some
4,000 submissions across 29 technologies in the review,
according to Hendry. The new banding levels for technologies
such as wind farms take effect from April 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
