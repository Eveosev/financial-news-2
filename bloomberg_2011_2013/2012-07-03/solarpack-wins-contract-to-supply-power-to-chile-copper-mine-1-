Solarpack Corp. Tecnologica , a
Spanish solar-energy developer, won a contract to supply energy
to the Collahuasi copper mine in northern  Chile  as the nation
seeks to boost its use of renewable energy.  Solarpack, based in Getxo,  Spain , will provide 60,000
megawatt-hours a year from two solar plants starting in the
fourth quarter of 2013, Compania Minera Dona Ines de Collahuasi,
the mine’s operating company, said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Under Chilean law, 5 percent of all electricity must come
from renewable sources, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance. That will rise to 10 percent in 2024.  Solarpack will begin building the plants at the end of the
year in the Tarapaca region, according to the statement.  The mining company solicited bids for the power contract in
mid-2011 and received 10 proposals. The company is owned by
 Anglo American Plc (AAL) ,  Xstrata Plc (XTA)  and a group of Japanese
companies.  Solarpack was awarded a contract in November 2010 to build
a 1-megawatt solar plant for the state-run mining company
Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile’s facilities at
Chuquicamata.  To contact the reporters on this story:
