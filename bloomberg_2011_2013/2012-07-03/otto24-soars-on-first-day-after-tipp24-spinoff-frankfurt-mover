Lotto24 (LO24)  AG, the state lotteries
broker spun off from Tipp24 SE, soared on its first day of
trading in Frankfurt as its former parent declined.  Lotto24 closed at 3.45 euros, 38 percent higher than the
offer price of 2.50 euros. The company traded for the first time
after Tipp24 shareholders approved the spinoff last month.
Tipp24 fell 2.1 percent to 38.30 euros, the eighth consecutive
decline, for the longest falling streak since it went public in
October 2005.  “Lotto24 worked as a dividend in kind,” Sascha Berresch,
an analyst at Hauck & Aufhaeuser AG in Hamburg, said by phone
today. “It’s possible that some investors only bought Tipp24
shares to get at the Lotto24 stock and now they are dumping
them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
