German Chancellor  Angela Merkel 
declined to take sides in a dispute over sovereign-bond buying
by the euro area’s future rescue fund, saying “we have to
respect”  Finland ’s opposition to such aid.  “The issue here was what is the most efficient, what is
the best method to achieve something,” Merkel said in Berlin
today after talks with Slovak Prime Minister  Robert Fico .
Conditions for emergency financial aid to euro countries will be
decided case by case, she said.  Finland has demanded collateral for any euro-area rescue
loans to aid Spanish banks on which taxpayers don’t have the
first right of repayment. Finland and the Netherlands also
oppose allowing the planned European Stability Mechanism to buy
Spanish bonds in the secondary market to lower borrowing costs.  With Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  pressing for help
to protect his country from the debt crisis, euro-area leaders
agreed at a summit on June 29 to use the ESM’s tools “in a
flexible and efficient manner” under eased conditions. The
tools include sovereign-bond buying by the rescue fund.  “The discussions in Brussels were more general,” Merkel
said. “It was about secondary as well as primary market
intervention, if I understood it correctly. We have to respect
the decisions of individual states. I haven’t had the
opportunity yet to discuss this with the Finnish government.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
