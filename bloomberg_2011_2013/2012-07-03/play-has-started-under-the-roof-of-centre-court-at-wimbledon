Play has started at Centre Court
under the retractable roof. The roof had opened minutes before
the noon start time, only for play to be delayed and the roof to
be shut when it started to rain. Juan Martin Del Potro of
Argentina plays Spainâ€™s  David Ferrer . The covers are coming off
on the outside courts, where play will be resumed soon.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
