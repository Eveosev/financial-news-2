The U.S. Olympic Committee said it
will bypass the chance to host the 2022  Winter Games  in favor of
forming a panel of board members to recommend a bid strategy for
the 2024 and 2026 Olympics.  The U.S. last hosted the  Summer Olympics  in 1996 in Atlanta
and the Winter Olympics in 2002 in Salt Lake City.  “Hosting the games is very important to us,” USOC Chief
Executive Scott Blackmun said yesterday on a conference call.
“I’d be very surprised if we didn’t submit a bid for 2024 or
2026, but between those two we haven’t made any decisions
whatsoever.”  The USOC and the  International Olympic Committee  agreed in
May on a revenue-sharing agreement that ends discord between the
two bodies that hampered previous U.S. bids. The USOC had said
that it wouldn’t submit another bid until the dispute was
resolved, having previously lost this month’s Summer Games to
 London  and the 2016 Olympics to Rio de Janeiro.  Denver;  Salt Lake City ; Bozeman,  Montana ; and the Reno-Lake
Tahoe area of Nevada and  California  had indicated an interest in
pursuing the 2022 Winter Olympics.  Following the second half of their board meeting yesterday,
USOC officials unanimously voted not to pursue the 2022 Winter
Games. Blackmun said focusing instead on the 2024 Olympics and
the 2026 Winter Games would give the USOC time to form
partnerships with federal, state and local governments, as well
as other international sports organizations.  “It wasn’t about not bidding for 2022 as much as it was
about what strategy gives us our best chance for submitting a
winning bid,” Blackmun said. “We concluded that 2024 and 2026
did that. That would allow us to put our best foot forward.”  December Meeting  The USOC said its subcommittee will make a report on the
strategy and timeline for future bids at a meeting in December.  Under the revenue-sharing agreement with the IOC, the USOC
will contribute toward the cost of staging the games and take a
reduction in future revenue growth from television and
sponsorship rights. The two sides also settled on procedures for
broadcast-rights negotiations and the use of historic television
footage.  This year’s Olympics start July 27, when London will become
the first three-time host after staging the games in 1908 and
1948.  New York  unsuccessfully bid for the 2012 Games, which were
awarded in 2005. The USOC’s bid to host the 2016 Games ended
when Chicago was eliminated in the first round of voting in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
