The Philippines may ask the U.S. to
deploy spy planes to monitor areas of the South China Sea
following an increase in incidents amid a territorial dispute
with China, a presidential spokesman said.  “There is no aggressive intent and it should not be seen
as a provocation,” Ricky Carandang, President  Benigno Aquino ’s
spokesman, said by telephone from Manila today. The Philippines
would  need U.S. P3 Orion planes because the nation doesn’t have
aircraft with spying capabilities, Reuters reported yesterday,
citing comments Aquino made in an interview.  The U.S. “supports the Philippines in enhancing its
maritime domain awareness,” State Department spokeswoman
 Victoria Nuland  told reporters yesterday in Washington, while
referring specific questions on military cooperation to the
Pentagon.  Aquino’s cabinet will meet July 5 to discuss the
territorial dispute, including whether to redeploy ships to the
Scarborough Shoal, Carandang said. Tensions have risen since a
standoff that began in April between ships from both countries
over the Scarborough Shoal, which China’s government calls
Huangyan island.  To contact the reporters on this story:
