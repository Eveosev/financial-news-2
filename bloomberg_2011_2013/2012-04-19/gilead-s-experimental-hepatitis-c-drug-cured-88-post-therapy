Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) ’s experimental
hepatitis C drug cleared the virus in 88 percent of patients
four weeks after treatment ended in a study, the company said
today.  A combination of Gilead’s 7977 drug and the antiviral
ribavirin cleared 22 out of 25 patients who hadn’t tried other
medications after 12 weeks on the therapy, the Foster City,
California-based company said at the European Association for
the Study of Liver meeting in Barcelona.  Gilead, the world’s largest HIV drugmaker, spent $10.8
billion to acquire Pharmasset Inc. and its drug 7977. The
company’s shares declined the most in 11 years after it said in
February that patients who had failed prior therapies relapsed
when they stopped taking its drug.  Gilead is among several companies including Abbott
Laboratories,  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) , Merck & Co. and  Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX)  working on hepatitis cures that don’t
require the use of interferon, an injection tied to flu-like
side effects.  If Gilead’s hepatitis C drug is approved, at the end of
2013 at the earliest, it may add $3 billion to $4 billion in
revenue by 2018, according to  Michael Yee , an analyst with RBC
Capital Markets in San Francisco.  Hepatitis is a viral infection that can cause swelling and
inflammation of the liver and can lead to damage of the organ,
cancer and death, according to the National Institutes of
Health. More than 170 million people are infected globally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
