Brent oil rose in London as a debt
sale by  Spain  bolstered confidence in  Europe ’s recovery,
countering concern that rising U.S. inventories will leave the
market over-supplied.  Brent climbed as much as 1 percent after Spain sold 2.54
billion euros ($3.3 billion) of bonds, just above the maximum
target for the auction. U.S. supplies gained 3.9 million barrels
last week, yesterday’s Energy Department data showed. The median
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of analysts was for an
increase of 1.8 million barrels. In  New York , prices slipped
after Labor Department data showed more Americans filed for
 unemployment benefits  last week than forecast.  “Market sentiment is better today, as equity markets and
the euro advance on expectations the worst is over and most of
negative news is priced in,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of
commodities research at Commerzbank AG, who predicts U.S. crude
prices will average $104 a barrel this quarter. “U.S.
inventories increased beyond expectations on weak demand and
high supplies.”  Brent oil for June settlement rose as much as $1.15 to
$119.12 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
and was at $118.36 at 1:38 p.m. London time. The European
benchmark contract’s  premium  to West Texas Intermediate was at
$15.37, up from $14.85 yesterday.  Crude for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
was at $102.50 a barrel, down 17 cents. It slid 1.5 percent
yesterday, the most since April 4. The more-actively traded June
contract was up 22 cents at $103.34 a barrel. Front-month prices
are 4.1 percent higher this year.  Fuel Stockpiles  Jobless claims fell by 2,000 to 386,000 in the week ended
April 14 from a revised 388,000 the prior period that was higher
than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today
in  Washington . The median forecast of 47 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 370,000.  Oil in New York has technical support along its 100-day
moving average, around $101.93 a barrel today, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Futures have been trading above this
indicator for the past week. Buy orders tend to be clustered
near chart-support levels.  U.S. crude stockpiles climbed to 369 million barrels, the
highest level since May 27, the Energy Department data showed.
Refineries operated at less than 85 percent of capacity for a
second week, according to the report.  “The trend is there for inventories to build but we
haven’t seen dramatic decreases in the price of the commodity,”
said  Jonathan Barratt , chief executive of Barratt’s Bulletin, a
commodity markets newsletter in Sydney. “The market is trying
to work out if we’re in a recovery mode or slowing. It’s a bit
quiet in Iran and the  Middle East , but it’s still there.”  Gasoline Declines  Gasoline inventories decreased  3.7 million barrels ,
compared with a median forecast for a decline of 1.1 million
barrels in the Bloomberg survey. Gasoline for May delivery slid
yesterday 3.13 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.2027 a gallon on the
New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday. That’s the lowest
closing price in seven weeks.  Distillate inventories, a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, dropped 2.91 million barrels last week, the
Energy Department said. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg predicted
they would shrink by 125,000 barrels.  No Shortage  Iraq ’s deputy prime minister for energy said the  Strait of
Hormuz  is unlikely to close and there is no shortage of oil.  The oil market is balanced and there is no need for OPEC to
change its output quota if demand remains at current levels,
Iraq’s Hussain al-Shahristani said in an interview in  London .
Ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
are scheduled to meet June 14 in Vienna.  Iraq is hosting an international diplomatic gathering next
month to discuss Iran’s alleged efforts to develop nuclear
weapons as sanctions restrict buyers of its crude. Iran has
threatened to shut the Strait of Hormuz, a transit route for a
fifth of the world’s oil, in response to an embargo.  Japan ’s crude imports slid 2.4 percent in the fiscal year
ended March, the  finance ministry  said today. Purchases from
overseas fell to 210 million kiloliters, while the cost climbed
22 percent to 11.9 trillion yen ($146 million). Japan accounted
for 5 percent of the world’s oil consumption in 2010, according
to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
