Estonia’s government approved a
dividend payout totaling 127.7 million euros ($167.9 million)
from state-owned companies into this year’s budget, up from 88
million euros last year, Finance Minister Juergen Ligi said.  Eesti Energia AS, Estonia’s biggest utility, would
contribute 65 million euros, while Tallinna Sadam AS, the
country’s main port operator, would pay out 44 million euros,
Ligi told a news conference in the capital Tallinn today.  “Even if the government has committed to capital increases
in these companies, like in Eesti Energia, this is for new
projects, while the old projects still need to generate
revenue,” Ligi said.  The government of Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  is targeting
a budget deficit of 2.1 percent of gross domestic product this
year, the first gap in three years. The Cabinet has pledged a
capital injection of 150 million euros to Eesti Energia from
this year’s budget to help finance the company’s investment plan
totaling about 1.5 billion euros until 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
