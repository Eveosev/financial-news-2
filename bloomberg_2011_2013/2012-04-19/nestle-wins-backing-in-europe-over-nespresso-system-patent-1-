Nestle SA (NESN) ’s Nespresso coffee brand
won the backing of the  European Patent Office  over a disputed
patent covering its coffee machine and capsules.  The regulator upheld the existing patent in an “amended
form” by a committee of technical experts following objections
made by companies including  Sara Lee Corp. (SLE) , the office said
today in an e-mailed statement. The competing companies have the
right to appeal the decision, the Munich-based body said.  Nespresso has sued companies including Sara Lee for alleged
patent infringement while rejecting counterclaims. Rivals say
their capsules don’t infringe on any patents, seeking to edge in
on a market where retail sales may climb 47 percent globally
from 2010 to 2015, according to Euromonitor International.  “The decision of the court was positive for our
Nespresso” system, Nespresso Chief Executive Officer Richard Girardot said. “Obviously we are satisfied.”  Sara Lee is studying the office’s amendment to determine if
it needs to take further steps, Ernesto Duran, a spokesman for
Sara Lee based in the Netherlands, said by e-mail.  Nestle has built Nespresso into a brand worth more than 3.5
billion francs ($3.8 billion) after more than a decade of
double-digit growth by marketing the coffee as an affordable
luxury.  To contact the reporters on this story:
