South Africa’s Public Investment
Corp., Africa’s largest pension fund manager, said it invested
$250 million in Togolese lender  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , the
continent’s most geographically diverse bank.  “The $250 million share purchase will be affected by the
issuance of 3,125,000,000 shares in Ecobank, representing 19.58
percent of the total outstanding number of shares,” the
Pretoria-based PIC and Ecobank said in a joint statement e-
mailed today. “The transaction will bolster Ecobank’s Tier 1
capital and further enhance its ability to grow its business
across the African continent.”  Ecobank has operations in 32 African countries, more than
any other lender.  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , the South African bank
controlled by  Old Mutual Plc (OML) , said in December it had provided
the Lome, Togo-based bank with a $285 million loan to finance
expansion and may take a 20 percent stake in Ecobank by the end
of next year. The PIC, which manages almost 1 trillion rand
($127 billion), said last month it will invest as much $6.5
billion across the continent this year after reaping returns of
more than 18 percent in 2011.  “With this one investment, we will be immediately
optimizing our footprint on the rest of the continent, an action
that would otherwise require multiple investments and huge
effort as well as  resource allocation ,” Elias Masilela, chief
executive officer of the PIC, said in the statement.  Ecobank closed unchanged at 11.43 naira in Lagos trading,
and Nedbank fell 0.6 percent to 169.05 rand in Johannesburg.  Mike Brown , CEO of Nedbank, didn’t immediately respond to
e-mailed questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
