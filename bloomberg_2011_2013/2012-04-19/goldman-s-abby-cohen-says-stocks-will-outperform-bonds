Abby Joseph Cohen, senior U.S.
investment strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said equities
will give better returns than bonds in the mid-to-long term as
companies look to  emerging markets  for growth.  “You need to go back to the late 1950s to see a situation
which equities were priced as attractively as they are now
relative to bonds,” she said in a Bloomberg Radio interview
today with Tom Keene. “1958-1959 was a period in which
investors were very concerned about the economy and the yields
on many equities exceeded the yields on fixed income at that
point and -- as you know -- we moved into a multidecade  bull
market  in equities.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  surged 26 percent through
yesterday from its 2011 low on Oct. 3 as economic data beat
economists’ forecasts and Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said he will keep interest rates low through at least
late 2014 to spur growth.  “With yields at very low levels, bonds may not be all that
safe,” she said. “When yields do start to rise, as they may at
some point in the future, prices go down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
