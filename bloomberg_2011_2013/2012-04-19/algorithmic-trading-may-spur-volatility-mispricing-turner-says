The rise of algorithmic trading may
cause markets to be more volatile and securities to be
mispriced,  Adair Turner , chairman of the U.K.’s  Financial
Services Authority  will tell a U.S. audience today.  Regulators should also question whether high-frequency
trading “can possibly deliver significant positive social
value” by pricing securities at intervals of nano-seconds,
Turner will say, according to prepared remarks for a speech at
 Johns Hopkins University  in Baltimore. “There must be at least
some danger” the rise of computer-driven trading results in
increased volatility, according to Turner.  High-frequency traders have come under increased regulatory
scrutiny following the so-called flash crash in May 2010, during
which the  Dow Jones Industrial Average (INDU)  briefly lost almost 1,000
points. A proposed European tax on financial transactions could
cut high-frequency trading by as much as 90 percent “in some
market segments,” Manfred Bergmann, a European Commission
official, said last year.  It’s unclear what “positive social value high-frequency
trading delivers, and if it delivers no value, but makes its
individual traders richer, then some subtle and unnecessary rent
extraction process is at work,” Turner said in the speech text
provided by the FSA.  The practice is used in strategies where how fast a trade
is executed may be critical to profitability, which include
electronic market making and statistical arbitrage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
