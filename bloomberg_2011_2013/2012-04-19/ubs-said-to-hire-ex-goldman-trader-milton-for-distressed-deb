UBS AG (UBS) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
hired former  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  trader Timothy Milton for
its distressed credit business.  Milton started at UBS in New York last week, according to
three people familiar with the hire, who declined to be
identified because the appointment hasn’t been announced
publicly. He reports to Jeff Teach, global head of distressed
debt, special situations and loan trading, the people said.
Christiaan Brakman, a UBS spokesman, confirmed the hire.  UBS hired  Mike Weir  as a loan trader last year. He
previously ran the loan trading desk at Citadel Securities, a
unit of Ken Griffin’s Citadel LLC. UBS moved its credit sales
and trading team to New York from Stamford, Connecticut in
December.  There have been $175.1 billion of leveraged loans, those
rated below BBB- by  Standard & Poor’s (MHP)  and less than Baa3 at
 Moody’s Investors Service (MCO) , arranged in the U.S. this year,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. UBS has arranged $4
billion, the data show.  Loan prices have risen 2.7 cents on the dollar this year,
as measured by the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index. They
reached a high in the first quarter of 93.84 cents March 28.  Goldman Sachs recently named Bryan Mix global head of loan
trading, and Jonathan Meltzer and John Shaffer, co-heads of New
York credit sales. The changes came after the bank began
restricting people working in the loan sales and trading
business from receiving private information, such as corporate
financial projections.  To contact the reporter on this story:
