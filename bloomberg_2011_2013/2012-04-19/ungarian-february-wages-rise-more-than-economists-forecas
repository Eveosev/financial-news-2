Hungarian  wages  rose more than the
forecast of economists in February, driven by salaries at
private companies.  The average monthly gross wage surged 6.9 percent from a
year earlier to 216,568 forint ($956), the statistics office in
Budapest said in a statement today. The median estimate of 10
economists in a Bloomberg survey was 6.1 percent.  Wages at private companies rose 8.9 percent from a year
earlier, while salaries for state employees increased by an
average of 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
