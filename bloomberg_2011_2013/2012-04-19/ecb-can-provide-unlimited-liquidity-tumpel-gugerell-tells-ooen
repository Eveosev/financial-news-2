Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, a former
European Central Bank Executive Board member, said there are no
limits on the ECB’s ability to provide liquidity to fight the
euro area’s debt crisis, according to an interview published in
Oberoesterreichische Nachrichten.  “The ECB has great staying power,” Tumpel-Gugerell, 59,
who retired from her ECB position last year, was quoted as
saying by the Linz, Austria-based newspaper. “It can decide on
its own for how long it provides liquidity. Its instruments are
manifold and it decides autonomously which one it’s using, and
when,” she said, adding that the ECB must also observe its
primary goal of  price stability .  The ECB cut its benchmark rate to a record low of 1 percent
in December and pumped 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) into the
banking system to secure the supply of credit to households and
companies. The euro-area economy is projected to shrink by 0.3
percent in 2012, the  International Monetary Fund  said April 17.  Tumpel-Gugerell said that the low level of  interest rates 
was a belated consequence of the financial crisis and that they
would begin to rise again when the global economy picks up.  “In the long term, such low rates are not desirable,”
Tumpel-Gugerell said. “Higher rates prevent a misallocation of
capital. Higher rates are also important for the build-up of
savings, such as for retirement.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
