Most Asian  stocks  fell, with the
regional benchmark index retreating after yesterday rising the
most in three weeks, as bad loans held by Spanish banks surged
ahead of European bond sales today, damping investor confidence.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that depends on Europe for
about 80 percent of its sales, declined 1.2 percent in Hong
Kong.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202)  headed for its lowest close since
1976 in  Tokyo  after Chief Executive Officer Craig Naylor quit
over a disagreement with the Japanese company’s board. OCI Co.
fell 2.4 percent in Seoul after operating profit at the chemical
maker declined. Kasikornbank Pcl rose 4.6 percent in Bangkok
after the lender’s first-quarter net income surged 47 percent.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 0.1 percent to 124.83
as of 6:46 p.m. in Tokyo, with about five stocks falling for
every four that rose. Spain’s non-performing loans as a
proportion of total lending jumped to the highest level since
1994 ahead of Spanish and French debt auctions today.  “Investors are becoming more concerned about  Europe ’s
situation,” although not to the degree where people worried
about a sudden default of financial institutions like last year,
said Shintaro Takeuchi, a Tokyo-based portfolio manager at Tokio
Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co., which oversees about $106
billion. “It will still take a while for Europe’s debt crisis
to be fully resolved. It’s better to invest in assets with
higher yields than risky assets like stocks.”  The Asia-Pacific gauge, which includes  companies  from some
 emerging markets , rose 9.8 percent this year through yesterday
as central banks including Japan and  China  moved toward
additional easing and the  U.S. economy  showed signs of recovery.  Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.8 percent even as
exports grew at the fastest pace in a year in March. South
Korea’s Kospi index sank 0.2 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index increased 0.3 percent.  Hang Seng Gains  Hong Kong’s equity benchmark rose 1 percent as Chinese
lenders gained after a report reserve ratios for mainland banks
may be cut to stimulate the economy, according to Xinhua News
Agency, which cited an unidentified People’s Bank of China
official. The Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.2 percent.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.6 percent
today. The gauge dropped 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday as
Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. reported
that sales grew at the slowest pace since 2009.  Esprit slid 1.2 percent to HK$16.58 in Hong Kong.  Nikon
Corp. (7731) , a camera maker that gets more than a fifth of its sales
from Europe, dropped 2 percent to 2,343 yen in Tokyo.  Stocks on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index are valued at 12.7
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 13.2 times
for the S&P 500 and 10.7 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Nippon Sheet Glass  Nippon Sheet Glass slumped 6.9 percent to 108 yen, the
 steepest drop  in the  MSCI Asia Pacific Index. (MXAP)  Chief Executive
Officer Craig Naylor quit yesterday because of a clash with the
board, the company said yesterday. The departure leaves only
three non-Japanese CEOs leading Nikkei 225 companies.  OCI dropped 2.4 percent to 219,500 won in Seoul after
saying in a regulatory filing that its first-quarter operating
profit dropped 75 percent.  Kasikornbank rose 4.6 percent to 158 baht in Bangkok, the
best performer on Thailand’s SET100 Index, after net income in
the three months ended March rose 47 percent to 8.99 billion
baht ($291 million). The company said gains in lending and
interest income drove profit growth amid a recovery from last
year’s floods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
