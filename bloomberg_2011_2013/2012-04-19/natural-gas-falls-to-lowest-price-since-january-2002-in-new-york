Natural gas fell to the lowest
price in more than 10 years in  New York  before a government
report that is forecast to show stockpiles climbed amid a
period of reduced demand for the fuel.  U.S inventories rose by 24 billion cubic feet to 2.511
trillion in the week ended April 13, based on the median of 20
analyst  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Consumption typically
slumps after the winter heating season ends and before hot
weather drives demand from  power plants  to run air conditioners.  “We can expect mild weather in the near term,” Shiyang
Wang and Michael Zenker, analysts at Barclays Plc in New York,
said in a report e-mailed today. “Thursday’s storage-change 
consensus indicates the market generally expects a 24 billion
cubic feet injection. If the injection was higher than 
expected, gas contracts could see a fresh round of sell-offs.”  Futures for May settlement slid as much as 1.3 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $1.938 per million British thermal units, the
lowest level since Jan. 28, 2002, on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  today. The contract was at $1.945 at 9:44 a.m.
Singapore time.  U.S. gas inventories in the week ended April 6 expanded by
8 billion cubic feet to 2.487 trillion cubic feet, according to
the Energy Department. Supplies for that week were 59 percent
higher than the five-year average. The department is scheduled
to release its next weekly stockpile report at 10:30 a.m. in
 Washington .  Commodities traders watch temperature forecasts to gauge
energy use and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use
gas for heating, according to the Energy Department.  Demand for natural gas from electricity generators peaks in
the summer months to meet air-conditioning needs. Power plants
consumed about 31 percent of U.S. gas supplies in 2011,
department data show.  Lower Forecast   Standard & Poor's  cut its forecast for 2012 natural gas
prices at the  Henry Hub  in  Louisiana , the delivery point for
Nymex futures, by $1 to an average of $2 per million Btu as
“production and storage levels continue to outstrip demand,”
Paul Harvey, a credit analyst at the firm in New York, said in a
note to clients yesterday.  BNP Paribas SA lowered its 2012 outlook for futures to
$2.34 per million Btu from $2.70 in January, Teri Viswanath,
director of commodities strategy with the firm in New York, said
in a report yesterday. She also reduced her estimate for 2013 to
$3.68 from $3.85 “to account for lingering weakness in the
first quarter as a result of elevated inventories.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
