CaixaBank (CABK)  SA,  Spain ’s fourth-
biggest lender, said first-quarter profit fell 84 percent as it
complied with a government order for banks to recognize losses
for real estate.  Net income  dropped to 48 million euros ($63 million) from
300 million euros a year earlier, the Barcelona-based bank said
in a filing to regulators today. That missed the 162 million-
euro average  estimate  of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Spanish banks including CaixaBank are responding to a drive
by the government to make lenders recognize greater losses on
real estate piled up on their books during the country’s
property crash as it seeks to force the industry to restructure.
The company said last month it would buy  Banca Civica SA (BCIV)  in an
all-stock offer valued at 977 million euros as the banking
overhaul gathers pace.  To contact the reporter on this story:
