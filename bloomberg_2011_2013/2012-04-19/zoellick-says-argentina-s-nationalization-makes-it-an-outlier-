World Bank President Robert
Zoellick said Argentina is an “outlier” in Latin America and
most of the region’s leaders see the country’s nationalization
this week of  YPF SA (YPFD)  as a “mistake.”  Zoellick, in an interview with Bloomberg Television today,
said Argentina’s expropriation of the assets owned by Spain’s
 Repsol-YPF SA (REP)  reflect “populist” and protectionist pressures
that are prevalent in several countries around the world.  Zoellick said he shares the views expressed this week by
Mexican President Felipe Calderon that “no one in their right
mind” would invest in a country that nationalizes companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
