Spanish striker  Raul Gonzalez  says
he’ll leave German soccer club Schalke after the season and
continue his career outside of Europe.  Raul, 34, joined Schalke from Real Madrid, where he scored
a club-record 323 goals, in 2010. He’s scored 13 goals in his
first season with the Bundesliga team and has 14 this season.  Raul said he would seek a league that wasn’t “as strong as
on the ones in Europe” as he looks to spend more time with his
family.  “Playing at the top level in a European league really
restricted the time I had for my family,” he said on Schalke’s
 website . “I have a long career behind me and so I’ve decided to
change that.”  Raul last season helped Schalke reach the Champions League
semifinals, extending his record in that competition to 71 goals
scored and 142 matches played. He also scored 44 goals in 102
games for the Spanish national team from 1996 to 2006 and
appeared in three World Cups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
