Asia  fuel oil ’s discount to crude
shrank to the smallest amount in more than two months, signaling
reduced losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.
Glencore International Plc bought  jet-fuel  cargoes in Singapore.  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil climbed 82 cents to $4.23 a barrel below Asian
benchmark Dubai crude at 2:09 p.m. Singapore time, according to
data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. That’s the smallest
 discount  since Feb. 14.  BP Plc sold 20,000 metric tons of 180-centistoke fuel oil
to Gunvor Group Ltd. for May 9 to May 13 loading, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders who monitored transactions on the
Platts window. The cargo traded at $1 a ton over benchmark
quotes.  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., or
Unipec, bought the same volume of 380-centistoke grade from
PetroChina Co. for May 4 to May 8, the survey showed. The
shipment changed hands at a premium of $2.50 a ton, higher than
$2.25 in a similar transaction yesterday.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade dropped 75 cents to $9.75 a ton, PVM said. This  viscosity
spread  is the narrowest since Feb. 20, meaning bunker, or marine
fuel, declined less than higher-quality fuel oil.  Middle Distillates  Glencore purchased two 100,000-barrel cargoes of  jet fuel 
for May 4 to May 8 loading, according to the Bloomberg survey.
The Swiss trader bought from Royal Dutch Shell Plc at parity to
benchmark quotes and paid 30 cents a barrel over May prices to
Morgan Stanley.  Shell bought 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with 10
parts-per-million of sulfur from Total SA for May 10 to May 14
loading, the survey showed.  Europe ’s largest oil company paid
$3.10 a barrel above quotes.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged after falling to
50 cents a barrel at 2:09 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
A narrower  regrade  indicates it is less profitable to make
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rose 24 cents to $16.63 a
barrel, PVM data showed. This  crack spread  widened for a fourth
day, the longest rising streak since January.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures fell to $120.04 a ton at 5 p.m. Singapore time from
$127.71 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This
crack spread, a measure of the profit from making the gasoline
and petrochemical feedstock, declined for a third day.  Vitol Group sold 25,000 tons of open-specification  naphtha 
for second-half June delivery to Total at $1,036 a ton,
according to the Bloomberg survey.  ConocoPhillips sold 50,000 barrels of  95-RON gasoline  for
May 9 to May 13 loading to Shell at $132.80 a barrel, the survey
showed. The buyer has purchased at least 300,000 barrels of this
grade so far this month.  Refinery News  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp. shut the main units at its
