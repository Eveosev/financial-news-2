The euro weakened against the
dollar and pared an advance versus the yen as concern that
European nations face difficulty funding debt damped demand.  Europe ’s shared currency fell as yields on Spanish 10-year
benchmark bonds and French five-year debt rose at auctions,
fueling speculation on credit downgrades. The dollar climbed
versus the yen as  Bank of Japan  officials signaled they’ll keep
acting to weaken the currency. The greenback advanced against
all its major counterparts except the pound and the Taiwanese
dollar as weekly U.S. jobless claims were higher than forecast.  “Auction results over the past two weeks show that
European sovereigns are still able to place paper, but until
there is underlying economic growth, investors are going to
continue to demand steep yield premiums for the peripherals and
even for France,” said  Greg Anderson , the North American head
of Group-of-10 nations currency strategy at Citigroup Inc. in
 New York . “People are building yen positions in anticipation of
further easing next week.”  The euro declined 0.1 percent to $1.3106 at 9:26 a.m. New
York time. The 17-nation currency was up 0.2 percent to 106.81
yen, after earlier rising as much as 0.7 percent. The dollar
appreciated 0.3 percent to 81.49 yen.  French Rating  Credit-rating companies will probably downgrade France over
the next two to three years regardless of whether President
Nicolas Sarkozy or his Socialist challenge,  Francois Hollande ,
wins the election, Citigroup’s  Michael Saunders  wrote in a
client note today. The nation may be cut one level by both
 Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service, he wrote.
Italy, Spain, Ireland and Portugal also face potential
downgrades, he wrote.  Spain sold 2.54 billion euros ($3.33 billion) of two- and
10-year securities today and  France  raised 10.5 billion euros in
debt out of an 11 billion-euro goal. The yield on the 10-year
Spanish note was 5.743 percent, compared with 5.403 percent when
it was last sold in January. France’s five-year notes yielded
1.83 percent, up from 1.78 percent on March 15.  “The auction today went off quite well, but I think the
market is still incredibly skeptical about the funding issues in
Europe,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at the
online currency trader GFT Forex in New York. “The skepticism
of the bears seems to have the upper hand; $1.30 is the absolute
critical level of the euro-dollar.”  Yen Weakness  The yen has weakened 8.1 percent this year, the worst
performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro is the third-
biggest decliner, having fallen 0.8 percent.  The Bank of Japan is “committed” to monetary easing,
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said yesterday in a speech in New
York. Deputy Governor  Kiyohiko Nishimura  said the central bank
is ready to implement additional easing if necessary.  The  Dollar Index (DXY)  rose 0.1 percent to 79.683 after more
Americans than forecast filed  applications  for  unemployment
benefits  last week, a sign the improvement in labor-market
conditions may be stalling.  Jobless claims fell by 2,000 to 386,000 in the week ended
April 14 from a revised 388,000 the prior period that was higher
than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today
in Washington. The median forecast of 47 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for a drop to 370,000.  The yield on the Treasury 10-year note fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.96 percent. Futures on the
 S&P 500  rose 0.1 percent, and the MSCI World Index of stocks
fell 0.1 percent weaker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
