(Corrects revised February producer-price figure in seventh
paragraph.)  Polish industrial-output growth
slowed in March to the lowest rate since November 2009,
suggesting the European Union’s biggest eastern economy is
losing strength and damping calls for higher borrowing costs.  Production rose 0.7 percent from a year earlier after
increasing 4.6 percent in February, the Central Statistical
office in Warsaw said today. That compares with the 4.4 percent
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 30 economists. Output
rose 10.7 percent on the month.  Economic growth in  Poland , the only EU member to dodge a
recession in 2009, will slow to 2.5 percent this year from an
estimated 4.3 percent in 2011 as the euro-region debt crisis
curbs export demand, the government forecasts. Today’s data,
along with wage and employment figures, “should be enough” to
decide whether to leave  interest rates  unchanged for an 11th
month in May, central banker Anna Zielinska-Glebocka said on
April 14.  “I don’t think these figures will give any reason to turn
more hawkish on monetary policy,”  Lars Christensen , an
emerging-markets analyst at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said
before the figures were released. “They will still feel pretty
comfortable that inflation will fall later in the year.”  Zloty Weakens  The zloty weakened after the data release to 4.1877 per
euro at 2:06 p.m. in Warsaw, down 0.1 percent on the day. The
two-year government bond yield dropped 5 basis points to 4.68
percent, from 4.73 percent before the announcement.  Hiring at companies with more than nine workers fell 0.1
percent from the previous month in March, while average gross
wages rose 3.8 percent from a year earlier in March after a 4.3
percent surge the previous month, the statistics office reported
yesterday.  Producer prices  rose 4.5 percent from a year earlier, slowed
from a revised 6.0 percent advance in February, the statistics
office said in a separate report. That’s below the 4.8 percent
median forecast of 21 economists in a Bloomberg survey. Factory-
gate prices rose 0.1 percent from February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
