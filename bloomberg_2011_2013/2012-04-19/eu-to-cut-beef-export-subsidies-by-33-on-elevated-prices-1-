The European Union will cut export
subsidies for beef by 33 percent because of elevated prices and
a “tight” market.  Export refunds for beef carcasses will drop to 163 euros
($213) a metric ton from 244 euros, the European Commission, the
EU’s executive arm, wrote in an e-mailed statement today. Rates
for deboned, fresh and other cuts will be reduced accordingly,
it wrote.  The proposals will take effect immediately on their
publication in the EU’s official journal, scheduled for tomorrow
or the day after, the statement showed. The EU may export
445,000 tons of beef this year, accounting for 5 percent of
world trade in the meat, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
forecast this month, cutting its outlook by 20,000 tons from
October.  “The market is relatively tight, with production
relatively low and prices high,” the commission wrote. “In
this context, exports are naturally reduced and imports are
decreased due to a lack of supply worldwide.”  Refunds for processed pig-meat products including hams and
sausages were cut to zero, according to the commission. Export
subsidies for eggs were lowered because of higher EU prices due
to a shortage, it said.  Export refunds for poultry were left unchanged, with the
subsidy for frozen whole chicken at 325 euros a ton, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
