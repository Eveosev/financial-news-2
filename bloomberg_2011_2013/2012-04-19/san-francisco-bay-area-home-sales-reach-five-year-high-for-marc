Home sales in the San Francisco Bay
Area reached the highest level for the month of March in five
years as an improving economy and low  interest rates  lured
buyers, according to  DataQuick .  A total of 7,694 houses and condominiums sold last month in
the nine-county region, up 35 percent from February and 9.1
percent from March 2011, the San Diego-based data seller said
today in a statement. March sales were last higher in 2007, when
they reached 8,317. Condo resales totaled 1,734, the most for
any month since August 2006.  “While the changes we’re seeing are incremental, they’re
incremental in a positive direction,” DataQuick President  John Walsh  said in the statement. A backlog of distressed properties
and tight mortgage credit are “two of the big issues” still
holding back the market, he said.  The Bay Area median price last month was $358,000, up 10
percent from February and down 0.6 percent from March 2011.
Prices have dropped on a year-over-year basis every month since
October 2010, with last month’s decline being the smallest.  Prices in  San Francisco  County were unchanged from a year
earlier at a median $650,000. In Marin County, the median fell
almost 16 percent to $565,000.  Eight of the region’s nine counties had sales gains from a
year earlier, led by Solano with a 13 percent advance.
Transactions rose 11 percent in San Francisco and 7 percent in
 Santa Clara . In Napa, the only county to have a decrease, sales
fell 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
