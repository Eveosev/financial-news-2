Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) , the
best-performing restaurant stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index last year, said first-quarter profit rose 35 percent as
U.S. consumers dined out more.  Net income rose to $62.7 million, or $1.97 a share, from
$46.4 million, or $1.46, a year earlier, the Denver-based
company said in a statement today. Analysts  projected  $1.93, the
average of 25 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The burrito seller has sought to draw customers by touting
locally sourced meat and vegetables as Americans become more
concerned with food provenance. Fast-food competitors  McDonald’s
Corp. (MCD)  and  Wendy’s Co. (WEN)  have recently tried to win consumers by
also emphasizing fresh ingredients and disclosing their foods’
origin.  “Chipotle continues to deliver pretty much across the
board,” Andy Cross, chief investment officer at the Motley Fool
in Alexandria,  Virginia , said in an interview. The company is
taking “more and more market share from competitors given their
quality of food,” he said.  Chipotle rose 1.1 percent to $435.60 at 4:26 p.m. in  New
York . The  shares  closed today at $430.78 and gained 59 percent
in 2011.  Sales at stores open at least 13 months gained 12.7 percent
due to “increased traffic in the quarter as well as the impact
of menu price increases,” the company said in the statement.
Analysts were expecting a 10.9 percent same-store sales
increase, the average of 24 estimates compiled by Consensus
Metrix.  Higher Prices  Chipotle has raised menu prices because of higher costs for
items such as beef, dairy and avocados during the past year. The
company, led by founder and Co-Chief Executive Officer Steve Ells, expects food inflation to be in the “mid-single digits”
this year, according to the statement.  Revenue rose 26 percent to $640.6 million in the quarter.
Analysts estimated $631.4 million, on average.  Chipotle has more than 1,200 U.S. locations and restaurants
in  Canada  and the U.K. The company plans to open as many as 165
new stores this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
