Total SA sold a North Sea Forties
crude cargo at the lowest price in almost two years after
offering the same shipment for seven days. No bids or offers
were made for Russian Urals blend in  Europe .  Asian refiners will reduce daily imports of West African
crude in May by 3.6 percent to the lowest in five months, a
survey of five traders and an analysis of loading programs
obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  Total sold the Forties cargo for May 2 to May 4 loading to
Royal Dutch Shell Plc at 85 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent, the smallest differential since May 14, 2010, according
to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the
Platts trading window. This compares with the last trade at a
discount of 70 cents to the benchmark on April 17.  Total also bought a shipment for May 9 to May 11 from Shell
at 50 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, the survey showed.  Statoil ASA failed to sell Forties for May 8 to May 10 at
50 cents less than Dated Brent, according to the survey.  Reported  North Sea  trading typically occurs during the
Platts window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the
session, Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 80 cents a barrel
less than Dated Brent, the lowest since May 19, 2010, compared
with a discount of 69 cents yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent futures for June settlement traded at $118.43 a
barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close
of the window, up from $116.79 yesterday. The July contract was
at $118.25, a discount of 18 cents to June.  A Forties cargo for loading in May was delayed by one day,
the first to be delayed in next month’s schedule, according to
two people with knowledge of the export program.  The shipment with parcel number F0504 was postponed to May
8 to May 10, said the people, who declined to be identified
because the information is confidential.  The share of Buzzard crude in the Forties blend fell to 46
percent in the week to April 15, from 49 percent a week earlier,
BP Plc said on its website.  A booking by Chevron Corp. to hire an oil tanker that would
have carried North Sea crude to  South Korea  in May was canceled,
according to Optima Shipbrokers Ltd.  The Achilleas, a very large crude carrier, was scheduled to
load 270,000 metric tons of crude from Hound Point terminal in
 Scotland  on May 3 and head to South Korea at a cost of $7.75
million, Athens-based Optima and other shipbrokers said in
reports on April 16.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals was at $2.80 a barrel to Dated Brent in northwest
Europe, up from the one-year low of a discount of $3.83 a barrel
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shell and BP failed to buy two cargoes of Urals in
northwest Europe yesterday at $2.85 a barrel less than Dated
Brent, compared with a bid at a discount of $3.90 on April 17.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold 100,000 tons of the blend via a
tender to Glencore International Plc for loading on May 3 to May
4 from Ust-Luga on the  Baltic Sea , said two traders who
participate in the market.  West Africa  Trafigura didn’t manage to sell 950,000 barrels of Nigerian
Bonny Light crude for May 10 to May 11 loading at $1.20 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, 30 cents lower than its offer yesterday,
the survey showed.  A total of 59 cargoes are scheduled for export from  Angola ,
 Nigeria , Republic of Congo,  Equatorial Guinea ,  Democratic
Republic  of Congo and Gabon, one less than in April, according
to the survey. This equals 56.1 million barrels, or 1.81 million
barrels a day, the lowest since December, compared with 1.88
million this month.  Indian Oil Corp. bought 1 million barrels of Nigerian EA
and Bonny Light crudes for loading in June from Shell in a
tender, three traders who participate in the market said.  Indonesia ’s PT Pertamina is seeking to buy low-sulfur crude
cargoes of either 600,000 barrels or 950,000 barrels to be
delivered to its Cilacap refinery in July, according to a
document obtained by Bloomberg News. The tender will be awarded
on April 25.  India ’s Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. shut the
entire facility in southern India because of a water shortage,
P.P. Upadhyay, the technical director, said by telephone today.
The company last week bought 600,000 barrels of Qua Iboe for
June loading from Vitol Group via a tender.  Qua Iboe blend was at $1.79 a barrel to Dated Brent, the
