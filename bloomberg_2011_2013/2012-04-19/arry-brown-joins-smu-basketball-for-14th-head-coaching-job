Larry Brown, the only coach to win
college and National Basketball Association championships, has
taken over  Southern Methodist University ’s basketball program as
it prepares to join the  Big East  Conference.  Brown’s hiring was confirmed today in an e-mail from Brad
Sutton, a spokesman for the Dallas-based school.  SMU is the 14th head coaching job for the 71-year-old
Brown, who most recently led the NBA’s Charlotte Bobcats before
resigning 28 games into the 2010-11 season.  “I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to coach at SMU,”
Brown said in a news release posted on the school’s website. “I
always thought of myself as a college coach, and this gives me a
wonderful chance to get back where I started.”  The Bobcats are among eight NBA franchises that Brown
coached to playoff appearances. He was the league’s Coach of the
Year in 2001 and led the  Detroit Pistons  to the NBA championship
in 2004, 16 years after guiding the University of Kansas to the
National Collegiate Athletic Association title.  Brown, who was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in
2002, succeeds Matt Doherty, who was fired as coach last month
with an 80-109 mark in six seasons at SMU. The Mustangs, who
haven’t made the NCAA tournament since 1993, will officially
join the Big East in all sports on July 1, 2013, after competing
in Conference USA.  The Big East sent nine schools to the NCAA tournament this
season, one year after breaking its own record with 11 spots in
the field.  “We have set a goal of top-25 status for our men’s
basketball program and want to compete for Big East
championships,” SMU athletic director Steve Orsini said last
month when Doherty was dismissed.  NBA Stops  Since his last college job with  Kansas , Brown has coached
the NBA’s Bobcats,  New York Knicks , Pistons, Philadelphia 76ers,
 Indiana Pacers , Los Angeles Clippers and  San Antonio Spurs .  Brown, who played point guard under Dean Smith at the
University of  North Carolina  and won a gold medal with the U.S.
team at the 1964 Olympics, began his coaching career at Davidson
College in 1972.  Brown then coached the American Basketball Association’s
Carolina Cougars, the NBA’s Denver Nuggets and  New Jersey Nets ,
and UCLA before arriving at Kansas in 1983. He was voted the
Naismith Coach of the Year in 1988 after leading the Jayhawks to
the national title and has a 177-61 record as a collegiate
coach. Brown has totaled 1,327 wins as an NBA and ABA coach.  To contact the reporter on this story:
