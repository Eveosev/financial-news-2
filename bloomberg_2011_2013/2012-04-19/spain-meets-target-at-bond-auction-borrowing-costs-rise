Spain  sold 2.54 billion euros ($3.3
billion) of bonds, just above the maximum target for the
auction, and its borrowing costs rose. Bonds declined after the
sale.  The Treasury sold its 10-year benchmark bond at an average
yield of 5.743 percent, compared with 5.789 percent on the
secondary market before the sale and 5.403 percent when it last
sold them in January. It sold two-year securities at 3.463
percent.  Demand for the 10-year debt was 2.42 times the amount sold,
compared with 2.17 at the Jan. 19 sale, and the bid-to-cover for
the bonds maturing in October 2014 was 3.28.  “Expectations were centered on a good auction, and it was
a mixed auction,”  Peter Chatwell , a fixed income strategist at
 Credit Agricole  said in a telephone interview.  Today’s auction was the first Spanish bond sale since the
Treasury sold near the minimum target of three- and five-year
bonds on April 4 as the effect of  European Central Bank ’s
unlimited three-year lending to banks started to fade. Spain’s
10-year yield has climbed about 40 basis points since then.  “It doesn’t seem that all the cash has been spent but
perhaps the willingness is not there to support these markets on
the scale that was happening in January and February,” Chatwell
said.  ECB Lending  The ECB lent more than 1 trillion euros to banks in
December and February, leaving lenders flush with cash and
underpinning demand for  government bonds . Spanish bank holdings
of local debt surged to 220 billion euros in January from 178
billion euros in November, Treasury data shows, while foreign
investors’ holding dropped.  Spanish 10-year bonds fell after the auction, with the
yield rising to 5.868 percent at 10:52 a.m. in Madrid. The Ibex
35 main share index fell 0.5 percent.  Spain has taken advantage of the ECB’s liquidity measures
to step up debt sales in the first months of the year, and had
sold 47 percent of its planned issuance by April 4, it said
yesterday. It faces 11.9 billion euros of bond redemptions in
April, 12.7 billion euros in July, and 20.2 billion euros in
October, Treasury data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
