Hector Sants, the U.K.’s  Financial
Services Authority  chief, said the agency would seek ways to
ensure clients of failed investment firms get their assets back
faster in the wake of the failure of MF Global Holdings Ltd.  The FSA is working on rules to ensure “the information
and records required by an insolvency practitioner to return a
client’s assets is readily available” in a letter last month to
 Andrew Tyrie , a Conservative lawmaker.  “Under the current legislative and regulatory landscape,
client assets distribution will remain something that occurs
over the course of months, rather than weeks, even in the most
orderly of firm failures,” Sants said in the letter, dated
March 19, on the U.K. parliament’s  website .  About $1 billion of  MF Global (MFGLQ) ’s U.K. client money remains
locked away in other financial institutions after the
brokerage’s collapse, administrators at KPMG LLP said last
month. The figures relate to unsegregated client accounts, which
MF Global mixed with its own funds and have been difficult for
the administrators to recover.  MF Global was the fifth-largest financial company to file
for bankruptcy when it sought protection on Oct. 31 after
getting margin calls on its bets on European sovereign debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
