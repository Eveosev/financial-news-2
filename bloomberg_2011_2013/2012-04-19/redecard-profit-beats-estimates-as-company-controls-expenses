Redecard SA (RDCD3) , the Brazilian card-
payment processor that  Itau Unibanco Holding SA (ITUB4)  is seeking to
buy, said its first-quarter profit rose 36 percent, beating
estimates, after the company controlled expenses by reducing
headcount.  Adjusted net income , which excludes some items, advanced to
381.2 million reais ($202.9 million) from 281.3 million reais a
year earlier, the Sao Paulo-based company said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. The result was above the  mean estimate  of
367.1 million reais in a Bloomberg survey of nine analysts.  Operating costs declined 3.5 percent to 134.8 million reais
as the company reduced its workforce to 952 employees from 1,054
at the end of 2011, following the reorganization led by Chief
Executive Officer Claudio Yamaguti, the company said in the
statement.  “The company managed to keep costs and expenses under
control, despite reversing some of the cuts in client services
made during the fourth quarter,” Carlos Firetti, Gustavo Lobo
and Bruno Chemmer, analysts at Bradesco BBI, wrote in a report
sent yesterday after the earnings were announced.  The combined value of credit-and debit-card transactions
increased 12 percent to 57.7 billion reais, and total cost of
services fell 0.6 percent to 246.4 million reais.  Itau, which owns 50 percent of Redecard, offered to pay 35
reais a share, or 11.8 billion reais, to purchase the rest of
the card-payment processor Feb. 7. The Sao Paulo-based lender
expects to hold an auction to buy out the lender between July
and August, Chief Executive Officer Roberto Setubal said in a
conference call April 16.  Redecard  fell  0.9 percent to 32.15 reais in  Sao Paulo ,
while its biggest rival  Cielo SA (CIEL3)  rose 0.2 percent to 60.94
reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
