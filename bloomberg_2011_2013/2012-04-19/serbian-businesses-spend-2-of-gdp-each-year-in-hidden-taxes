Businesses in  Serbia  are paying 730
million euros ($954.6 million) each year in hidden taxes, or 2
percent of economic output they could have spent on investments.  Companies in Serbia are paying 370 various taxes and
charges including land and registry fees, mineral and geothermal
resource fees, water and pollution charges, which translates
into a cost of 570 euros per employee in the private sector,
where 1.27 million people worked last year, according to a  study 
conducted by the USAID and Serbia’s Alliance for Local Economic
Development.  The survey of 1,000 businesses was conducted between
October and February following an increase in complaints by
businessmen over “excessive number of non-tax burdens” at a
time when the Balkan country is eager to lure new investors, the
study said.  Half of the total amount goes to the central government and
the rest is collected by local governments, it said. Serbia’s
fiscal deficit stood at $1.9 billion at the end of 2011, or 4.8
percent of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
