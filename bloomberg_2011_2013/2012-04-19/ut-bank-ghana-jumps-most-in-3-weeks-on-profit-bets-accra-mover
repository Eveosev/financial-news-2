UT Bank Ltd. (UTB)  of  Ghana , a lender in
the West African nation, rose the most in almost three weeks on
bets profit grew in the first quarter.  The stock gained 3.3 percent to 31 pesewas as of 1:16 p.m.
in Accra, the capital, the biggest gain since March 30.  “We are expecting UT’s profit after tax to increase by at
least 15 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier,”
Randy Mensah, a stock trader at Databank Financial Services Ltd.

performed very well last year and we expect that momentum to be
sustained, driven mainly by lending to small and medium-sized
businesses in line with expansion of the economy.”  UT Bank’s loans and advances grew 50.7 percent to 475.2
million cedis ($260.9 million) in 2011, according to its annual
