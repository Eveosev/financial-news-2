The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment increased,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to 166.5 basis
points as of 8:30 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. prices show. The gauge is on course for its highest
close in three days, according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index climbed 3 basis points to
157 as of 10:06 a.m. in Sydney,  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  prices
show. The measure has traded between 182.8 and 128.2 this year,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index gained 2 basis points to 175
basis points as of 9:20 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The index is also set for the highest close since April
16, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
