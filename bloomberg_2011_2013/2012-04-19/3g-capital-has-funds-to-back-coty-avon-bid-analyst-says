3G Capital Inc., the private-equity
firm backed by Brazilian billionaire  Jorge Paulo Lemann , has
$1.4 billion that it could use to back Coty Inc.’s bid for  Avon
Products Inc. (AVP) ,  Trevor Stirling  and Ali Dibadj, analysts at
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., said today in a note.  3G Capital, based in New York, freed up the funds by
selling a 29 percent stake in Burger King Worldwide Holdings
Inc. to Bill Ackman’s Justice Holdings, Stirling said in the
report. The companies have ties through Peter Harf, a Burger
King director who previously served as Coty’s chairman.  Avon rejected Coty’s $10 billion offer on April 2, saying
it undervalued the company and that its own turnaround is under
way. A week later, New York-based Avon named former  Johnson &
Johnson (JNJ)  executive Sherilyn McCoy as CEO to replace Andrea Jung,
who will remain as chairman.  Coty, also based in New York, has said it is confident in
its financing for the offer, including backing from Joh. A
Benckiser SE, which owns Coty, and from BDT Capital Partners
totaling more than $5 billion.  A spokesman for Coty declined to comment. A 3G spokesman
didn’t immediately return a call.  Avon rose 1.6 percent to $22.19 at the close in New York.
The shares have gained 27 percent this year.  Dibadj rates the shares market perform, the equivalent of a
hold.  To contact the reporters on this story:
