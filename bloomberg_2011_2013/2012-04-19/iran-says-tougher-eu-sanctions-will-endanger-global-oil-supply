Iranian Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi
said further European Union sanctions on his country will affect
global “energy supply security” and crude prices, according to
a report on the Shana website.  Exports to the U.K. and  France  have stopped, although
shipments continue to other European countries, he said on the
 Oil Ministry website . The EU plans to put sanctions on  Iran ’s
energy industry into effect on July 1.  Qasemi said he hoped for “good news” from a meeting to
discuss Iran’s alleged efforts to develop nuclear weapons, a
claim it denies.  The Baghdad meeting on May 23 will include negotiators from
Iran as well as the so-called P5+1 group of five permanent
United Nations Security Council members --Britain,  China ,
France, Russia and the U.S. -- plus Germany. The talks follow
discussions held in Istanbul on April 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
