The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the close of trading.  The  IGBC Index (IGBC)  dropped 0.8 percent to 14,998.22, while the
Colcap Index decreased 0.7 percent to 1,750.70.  Bolsa de Valores de Colombia SA  (BVC CB), the operator of
the country’s main stock exchange, increased 0.3 percent to
34.60 pesos, the highest level on a closing basis in a month.  The addition of  Mexico ’s main bourse to the Andean
integrated market, known as Mila, is getting closer and may more
than double the average daily volume in the market, said Jose Fernando Restrepo, the head analyst at Interbolsa SA in
Medellin, in an e-mail message to clients.  Colombian Trade Minister Sergio Diaz-Granados said he would
speak with Mexico’s Economic Ministry about the regulatory steps
in joining Mila in a meeting this week, according to an article
on Dinero magazine’s website yesterday.  Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PREC)  , the Toronto-based
oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia , gained 0.6
percent to 50,900 pesos. The company’s annual growth in oil
production will continue to attract investors even after the
concession for the Rubiales field expires, Raymond James
analysts led by Rafi Khouri said in a research note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
