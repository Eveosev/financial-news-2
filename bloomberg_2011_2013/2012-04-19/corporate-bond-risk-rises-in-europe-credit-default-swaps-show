The cost of insuring against
default on European corporate debt rose, reversing an earlier
decline, according to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings climbed 10.5 basis points to
683.5 at 3:32 p.m. in London. An increase signals deterioration
in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 2.5 basis points to 144.5 basis
points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 4.5 basis points to 254.5 and
the subordinated index rose 1.5 to 411.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
