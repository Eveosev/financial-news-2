Home prices  in Brooklyn,  New York ’s
most populous borough, declined 5.3 percent in the first quarter
as low mortgage rates pushed first-time buyers into the market
for cheaper properties.  The median price of condominiums, co-ops and one- to three-
family homes that changed hands in the the period fell to
$450,000 from $475,000 a year earlier, New York appraiser  Miller
Samuel Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate 
said today in a report. Purchases totaled 1,807, down 24 percent
from the four-year high reached in the first quarter 2011, said
 Jonathan Miller , president of Miller Samuel.  Demand shifted toward less-expensive homes as renters
discovered they could afford to buy amid a drop in borrowing
costs, according to Miller. The median price of condos sold in
the quarter fell 8.1 percent from a year earlier to $478,000,
according to Miller Samuel and Prudential. For cooperative
apartments, the median dropped 6.8 percent to $275,000.  “Cheaper stuff was bought because  mortgage rates  fell to
record lows and stayed there,” Miller said in an interview.
“The first ones to react tend to be the entry-level consumer,
someone that’s trying to get into the purchase market, and the
sharp drop in rates made it affordable.”  The average  interest rate  for a  30-year fixed  U.S. home
loan fell to 3.87 percent in February, the lowest in Freddie Mac
records dating to 1971. The rate was 4 percent or lower for all
but one week in the first quarter, according to the McLean,
Virginia-based mortgage financier.  Condo Sales Down  Condos accounted for 30 percent of all sales completed in
three months through March, down from 39 percent in the first
quarter of 2011, Miller said. Co-ops accounted for 20 percent of
deals, the same as a year earlier.  The number of  Brooklyn  properties  listed for sale  in the
quarter declined 17 percent to 6,092, as lenders delayed
bringing seized homes to the market while negotiating with state
attorneys general who were investigating foreclosure abuses. The
top U.S. mortgage-servicing banks agreed to a $25 billion
settlement in February.  “You have an inventory total that is light on
 foreclosures ,” Miller said. “If we didn’t have the hold-back
on inventory, you wouldn’t have seen the same level of decline
or any decline at all.”  Brooklyn homes stayed on the market an average of 152 days,
18 percent longer than a year earlier. Sellers pared an average
of 3.5 percent off their original asking price to strike a deal
in the quarter, compared with a 4.8 percent discount offered at
the beginning of 2011.  In Queens, the city’s second-most-populous borough, sales
plunged 16 percent in the first quarter to 2,176, and the median
price fell 1.1 percent to $346,275, according to  Miller Samuel 
and Prudential. The inventory of available properties fell 35
percent to 8,851.  To contact the reporter on this story:
