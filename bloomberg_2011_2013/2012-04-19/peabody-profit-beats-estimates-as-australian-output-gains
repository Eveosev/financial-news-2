Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest
U.S. coal producer, posted first-quarter earnings that beat
analysts’ estimates after an increase in output and revenue per
ton in  Australia .  Net income fell 2.2 percent to $172.7 million, or 63 cents
a share, from $176.5 million, or 65 cents, a year earlier, St.
Louis-based Peabody said today in a statement. Earnings
excluding a tax-related expense were 11 cents higher than the
 average  of 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales rose to $2.04 billion from $1.74 billion, missing the
$2.09 billion average of 16 analysts’ estimates.  Peabody is integrating assets from Australia’s Macarthur
Coal Ltd., which it acquired in December for metallurgical coal
mines and access to Asian customers. Peabody said last month
that storms and flooding in Queensland had limited access to the
company’s mines there and reduced output, warning that earnings
would be at the “low end” of the company’s targeted range of
50 cents to 75 cents a share.  “I think people had trimmed their numbers a little too
much to reflect the production disruptions over there,” said
Kuni Chen, an analyst at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut .  Peabody lowered its 2012 forecast for coal sales to a range
of 235 million to 255 million tons, from a range of 245 million
to 265 million tons, cutting its U.S. sales-volume forecast by
10 million tons. The company said U.S. coal-fueled electricity
demand may decrease by more than 100 million tons this year.  Lower U.S. Output  The company has reduced production from U.S. mines after
demand declined because of record high temperatures in the U.S.
and natural-gas prices fell to the lowest in a decade.  More than 15,000 records were broken in the continental
U.S. in March, as temperatures averaged 51.1 degrees Fahrenheit
(10.6 Celsius), 8.6 degrees above the 20th-century average,
according to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration . Gas futures fell below $3 per million British
thermal units during the quarter, causing power utilities to
shift to the cheaper fuel.  Greg Boyce, Peabody’s chief executive officer, said that
the company has had discussions with some customers who “have
fairly health stockpiles,” about rescheduling coal shipments
from this year into 2013 or 2014.  Rescheduling Shipments  “We’ve had some commercial discussions around rescheduling
those shipments,” Boyce said on a conference call with analysts
today. “There is the potential that we’ll see some continued
decrease in coal demand for the rest of the year, which will
require potentially some additional reductions across the
industry.”  Peabody rose 7 percent to $30.46 at the close in  New York .
The shares have fallen 8 percent this year.  Thermal coal is used in electricity generation while
metallurgical coal is combined with  iron ore  and other materials
to produce steel. The average price of metallurgical coal was
$168.63 a ton in the first quarter, 19 percent lower than a year
earlier, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
