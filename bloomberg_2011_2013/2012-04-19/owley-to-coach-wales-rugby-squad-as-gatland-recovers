Rob Howley will be the interim
manager of the Welsh rugby squad for matches against the
Barbarians and  Australia  as Warren Gatland recovers from
breaking both heels falling off a ladder.  Howley will take charge of coaching staff immediately, the
Welsh Rugby Union said today on its website. Gatland was hurt
earlier this month at his house in  New Zealand  and may need
surgery to heal the injuries.  Gatland led Wales to a Grand Slam victory in this year’s
Six Nations championship. Wales plays the Barbarians, an
invitational team, on June 2 before traveling to Australia for
three Tests against its national team. Howley will be in charge
for the first two matches, and then Gatland will assist him for
the final games against Australia.  “Warren can now concentrate on getting back to robust
health before taking back full control of  Wales  to continue the
great work he has already achieved,” WRU Chief Executive
Officer Roger Lewis said in a statement.  Gatland suffered multiple fractures to his right heel, and
a fracture in his left. Doctors have told him he’s unlikely to
bear weight on the right leg by early June.  Howley is a former scrum-half who made 59 appearances for
Wales, winning his first cap against the Barbarians in October
2001. His interim appointment allows him to develop as a coach
at the highest level, Lewis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
