Canadian companies had almost six
times more direct investment in the  Cayman Islands  than China
last year, with a greater share of investment in Barbados than
in all of Brazil, Russia, India and China - the so-called BRIC
economies, Statistics Canada data show.  The share of Canadian direct investment abroad in Barbados
last year was 7.8 percent, with 3.8 percent in the Cayman
Islands, the Ottawa-based agency said today. The share of
Canadian investment abroad in the BRIC countries was a combined
3.4 percent. Canada has more direct investment in the U.S. than
any other country, representing 40 percent of the total.  Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  said in a speech in
Waterloo, Ontario earlier this month that Canadian companies
should invest more in faster-growing regions of the world.  Canadaâ€™s direct investment in the Caribbean has grown for
most of the past 10 years,  Statistics Canada  said, and is
concentrated in the financial services industry.  Companies from the BRIC economies accounted for 5.6 percent
of direct investment in Canada last year, Statistics Canada
said, increasing their stake by 68 percent since 2007. Canadian
investment in the BRIC countries has grown by 49 percent over
that same period.  Statistics Canada said it used an annual survey of
companies to compile the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
