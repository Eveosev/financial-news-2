Kenya ’s shilling weakened the most
in more than a week against the dollar as companies pay taxes
due to the government by tomorrow.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy depreciated
as much as 0.3 percent, the most since April 11, to 83.32 per
dollar and was trading at 83.25 by 4:02 p.m. in Nairobi.  “The shilling is trading in a small range due to the tight
liquidity caused by tax payments that are due by April 20,”
Sameer Lagadia, head of trading at Nairobi-based  Diamond Trust
Bank Kenya Ltd. (DTKL) , said in a phone interview today.  Kenya collected 160.4 billion shillings ($1.93 billion) of
revenue in the fiscal third quarter, Revenue Authority
Commissioner-General John Njiraini told reporters today in the
capital. Collections increased from 141.4 billion shillings in
the same period a year earlier, he said.  The Ugandan shilling strengthened for the first time in
three days, adding less than 0.1 percent to 2,515 per dollar.  “Customers haven’t been active because some were still
settling mid-month tax obligations,” Faisal Bukenya, the head
of  currency trading  at  Barclays Bank  of Uganda Ltd. said by
phone from Kampala.  Tanzania’s shilling gained 0.3 percent to 1,585 against the
dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “It is the inter-bank market influencing the trend of the
shilling today,” Fred Siwale, a dealer with CRDB Bank Plc said
today by phone from  Dar es Salaam , the commercial capital. “I
have seen a number of banks demanding dollars probably to cover
their shortfalls.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
