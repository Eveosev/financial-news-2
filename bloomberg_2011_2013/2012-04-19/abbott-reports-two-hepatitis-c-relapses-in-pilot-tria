Few relapses were reported among
patients taking  Abbott Laboratories (ABT) ’ experimental hepatitis C
treatment, according to a study.  The Abbott-funded research, dubbed Pilot, found that 10 of
11 patients who hadn’t received prior treatment were cured 24
weeks after the end of a 12-week treatment on the drugmaker’s
hepatitis C drugs ABT-072 and ABT-450 with ribavirin, the Abbott
Park, Illinois-based company said today in a statement.  After 36 weeks, another patient relapsed, while no more
relapses were observed after 48 weeks, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
