billion euros of benchmark five-year debt at an average yield of
1.83 percent, compared with 1.78 percent on March 15.  Nestle advanced 1 percent to 57.20 Swiss francs,
contributing the most to the SMI’s gain. The company is in the
“pole position” to buy Pfizer Inc.’s nutrition unit Wyeth
Baby, which offers growth opportunities and a chance to regain a
“firm foothold” in  China , Jefferies Inc. said today.  Roche climbed 0.9 percent to 164.40 francs. The company
