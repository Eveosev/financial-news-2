Italian and Spanish bonds led
declines among  Europe ’s higher-yielding government securities
amid concern the regional debt crisis is worsening.  Italy’s  10-year yields  climbed for a second day after a
government report showed industrial orders fell more than
economists forecast and the Finance Ministry said debt-servicing
costs will increase. French bonds dropped after Citigroup Inc.
said it expects the nation’s credit rating to be cut over the
next two to three years. German  bunds  advanced as investors
sought the safest assets.  Spain  and  France  both raised the
amounts they targeted at debt auctions today.  “There is a quite significant widening” of Italian and
Spanish yields relative to German bunds, said  Peter Schaffrik ,
head of European interest-rate strategy at Royal Bank of Canada
in  London . “Those two economies have low growth and widening
budgets. For euro-investors bunds are the natural safe haven.”  The Italian 10-year bond yield rose 11 basis points, or
0.11 percentage point, to 5.59 percent at 4:18 p.m. London time.
The 5 percent bond maturing in March 2022 fell 0.795, or 7.95
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,312) face amount, to 96.10.  The extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of German bunds expanded 14 basis points to 390 basis
points, after reaching 409 basis points on April 11, the widest
since Feb. 16.  Spain’s  10-year yield  advanced eight basis points to 5.91
percent, increasing the spread over bunds by 11 basis points to
421 basis points.  Debt Servicing  Italy’s debt-servicing costs will rise to 5.3 percent of
gross domestic product this year from 4.9 percent in 2011,
according to the government’s economic and financial plan posted
on the  Finance Ministry ’s website today. Debt-servicing costs
are forecast to increase to 5.4 percent next year and to 5.6
percent in 2014, the plan showed.  Scrutiny of Europe’s high deficit nations is increasing as
the boost from the  European Central Bank ’s longer-term
refinancing operations fades. Spain’s 10-year yield has jumped
almost 1 percentage point since the end of February, while the
yield on the equivalent Italian security has increased about 40
basis points.  France’s  10-year yield  rose to the highest level in 12
weeks after Citigroup said the country’s credit rating will
probably be lowered by one level over the next two to three
years regardless of who wins the presidential election.  Fiscal Deficits  Fiscal deficits in all peripheral euro-region countries may
overshoot official estimates in 2012 and 2013, Citigroup’s
London-based economist  Michael Saunders  wrote in the note to
investors.  The French 10-year yield rose eight basis points to 3.08
percent after increasing to 3.12 percent, the highest level
since Jan. 26. The  spread  with German bunds widened to as much
as 143 basis points, the most since Jan. 10.  French credit risk is at the highest in three months on
concern anti-business policies will be adopted after the
presidential election as Europe’s debt crisis deepens. The first
round of voting in the election takes place on April 22.  Credit-default swaps on  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , the nation’s
third-largest lender, rose yesterday while  France Telecom SA (FTE)  led
an increase in corporate  default risk .  Bunds Gain  German 10-year bund yields dropped three basis points to
1.7 percent. The 10-year bund futures contract expiring in June
climbed 0.1 percent to 140.56, after reaching 140.78, the
highest level since the introduction of the euro in 1999.  Spain and France sold 13.05 billion euros in debt today,
with both countries raising their targeted amount even as
borrowing costs increased.  Spain sold 2.54 billion euros of two- and 10-year
securities, and France raised 10.5 billion euros versus its 11
billion-euro goal. Spain auctioned its 10-year benchmark at a
yield of 5.743 percent, compared with 5.403 percent when it last
sold the bonds on Jan. 19. France’s five-year notes had an
average yield of 1.83 percent, up from 1.78 percent on March 15.  “It was a reasonable set of auctions, they got a shade
more than they anticipated, but it did come at a price as
evidenced by the higher” borrowing costs, said  Richard McGuire ,
a senior fixed-income strategist at Rabobank International in
London. “The path of least resistance is for peripheral markets
such as Spain to come under renewed pressure irrespective of
whether we get one or two positive auction results.”  Volatility in Swedish  government securities  was the highest
among 24 global debt markets, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, two- and 10-year yield spreads and credit-default swaps
compiled by Bloomberg. French volatility was the highest among
euro-area nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
