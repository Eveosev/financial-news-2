Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , which today reported
quarterly operating losses in its handset and network equipment
businesses, will look to expand revenue from its patent
portfolio, Chief Financial Officer Timo Ihamuotila said.  “We still have a very large patent pool which is
unlicensed and so we see good opportunities here,” Ihamuotila
said on a conference call with analysts. The company’s royalty
income is on course to hit 500 million euros annually and has
grown over the past year, he said.  Nokia is stepping up cost cuts and plans to dispose of
“non-core” assets, which could include some patents,
Ihamuotila said. The Espoo, Finland-based company, which holds
patents and applications ranging from basic wireless protocols
to nanotechnology, transferred about 2,000 patents and patent
applications to  Canada ’s Mosaid Technologies Inc. for an
undisclosed sum last year.  “We can look as we have done in the past at certain patent
combinations which are more valuable outside Nokia than inside
the company, still keeping our strength, but it is unrealistic
with the current business model to say we could sell the whole
IPR portfolio,” Ihamuotila said.  Nokia records patent income in its devices and services
division and doesn’t break it out by quarter, he said. It
receives royalties from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  under an agreement reached in
June 2011, and from Microsoft as part of the partnership deal on
Windows phones.  To contact the reporter on this story:
