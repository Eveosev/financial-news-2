The week began with a reminder that springtime in  Afghanistan  is  fighting season . But it also marks the anniversary of a forgotten episode in U.S.-Afghan relations: Ten years ago Tuesday, President  George W. Bush   delivered a speech  at the Virginia Military Institute in which he  likened U.S. aid efforts  in Afghanistan to the Marshall Plan. The  Marshall Plan  was the post-World War II, extensive aid package designed to  build strong, democratic societies in Western Europe and thwart the threat of Communism. The 16 countries that benefited from the aid became some of the U.S.'s strongest allies, and went on to form the European Union and NATO. The lofty comparison in the  April 2002 speech was, to put it mildly, disingenuous. The  Marshall Plan , in 2002 dollars, amounted to  about $90 billion ; Bush at the time was  giving Afghanistan  less than $1 billion  in aid. The original Marshall Plan succeeded partly because the countries had existing infrastructure on which to build; Afghanistan barely had roads. It may have been just a speech, but U.S. news travels, and it helped to set expectations in Afghanistan that the U.S. was committed to creating a strong, prosperous society that rebuffed extremism. Not that there hasn't been progress. Afghans are healthier and better educated  than ever before ; the  media is vibrant ; and women have gone from being secluded in their homes to representing their fellow citizens  in parliament . Innovative aid programs like the U.S. Agency for International Development's  mobile money project  has worked with the country's flourishing telecommunications industry, which reaches 85 percent of the country, to create a virtual financial infrastructure that has led to greater economic efficiency and transparency.  And on Sunday, it was the Afghan National Security Forces that  effectively ended a multi-city  coordinated attack with  minimal civilian casualties . Still, Afghanistan will not have the grand-scale makeover that President Bush suggested 10 years ago, and our options for helping the Afghan people are becoming increasingly limited. On Bloomberg View this week,  Jeffrey Goldberg   asked a rare question : Americans  want out  of Afghanistan by 2014, but what will we think if large swaths of the country once again come under Taliban control in 2015? And what will be the state of women, the populace most invested in the words of the West? The argument that our credibility with Afghan citizens matters is not popular these days -- but  it does matter , not just for the sake of principle, but for our long-term interests in a volatile part of the world.
