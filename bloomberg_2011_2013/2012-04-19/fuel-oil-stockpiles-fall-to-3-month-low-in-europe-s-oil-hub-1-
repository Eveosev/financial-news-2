Fuel oil  stockpiles in independent
storage in  Europe ’s oil-trading hub of Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp fell to a three-month low this week as a cargo was
shipped to  Singapore , according to PJK International BV.  Fuel oil  stocks dropped 24 percent to 598,000 metric tons
in the week to today, according to PJK, a researcher in the
Netherlands. That’s the lowest level since Jan. 12 even as
supplies arrived from  France , Poland and Russia. A very large
crude carrier set sail for Singapore on April 14, PJK said.  Gasoil inventories declined 0.5 percent to 2.61 million
tons, according to PJK data. That’s the lowest level since mid-
March as cargoes were sent to France and West Africa. Supplies
of the fuel, which includes diesel, arrived from Finland,  Russia 
and the U.S.  Gasoline stockpiles fell 12 percent to 773,000 tons, the
lowest this month, PJK data show. Cargoes were shipped to Togo,
Nigeria and the U.S., according to PJK, while supplies arrived
from Cuba, France, Russia, Sweden and the U.K.  Naphtha stockpiles rose 16 percent to 79,000 tons as
cargoes arrived from the U.K., according to the data.  Jet fuel  storage gained 12 percent to 462,000 tons, the
most since March 22, on imports from Bahrain and the  United Arab
Emirates , the data show.  The following table shows the weekly inventory changes in
