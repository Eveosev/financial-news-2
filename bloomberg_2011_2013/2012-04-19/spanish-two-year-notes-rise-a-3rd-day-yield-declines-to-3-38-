Spanish  two-year notes  advanced for
a third day as the nation prepared to sell as much as 2.5
billion euros ($3.3 billion) of debt.  The two-year note yield fell three basis points to 3.38
percent at 8:37 a.m. London time. Ten-year Spanish bond yields
were one basis point lower at 5.81 percent.  Spain  is due to auction securities due in October 2014 and
January 2022, after raising more than its maximum target at a
bill sale on April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
