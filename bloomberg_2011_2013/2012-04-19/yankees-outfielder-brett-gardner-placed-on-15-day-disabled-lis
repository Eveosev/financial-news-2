New York  Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner was placed on the 15-day disabled list after injuring
his right arm while making a sliding catch  Gardner, 28, had an MRI yesterday after experiencing
soreness in his non-throwing arm, the team said in an e-mailed
statement. The left fielder was diagnosed with a bone bruise and
elbow strain sustained while making the catch in New Yorkâ€™s 8-3
win over the  Minnesota Twins  on April 17.  Gardner is hitting .321 in nine Major League Baseball games
since signing a one-year deal this offseason worth $2.8 million
dollars, according to CBS Sports. Last season he hit .259 with
87 runs scored and 49 stolen bases, tied with Coco Crisp for
most in the American League.  New York recalled right-handed pitcher Cody Eppley from its
Triple-A affiliate Scranton/Wilkes-Barre club to replace Gardner
on the active roster, according to the statement. The 26-year-
old Eppley allowed eight earned runs in nine innings last year
for the  Texas Rangers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
