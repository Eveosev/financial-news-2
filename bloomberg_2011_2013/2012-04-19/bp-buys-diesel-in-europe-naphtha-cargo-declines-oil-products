BP Plc bought a  diesel cargo  in
northwest  Europe , its ninth this month. Gasoil gained as
stockpiles fell for a second week. The front-month premium to
the June contract on the ICE Futures Europe exchange was at the
widest in two months.  Naphtha cargoes traded at a lower price. Royal Dutch Shell
Plc is starting units this week at its Pernis oil refinery,
Europe’s largest, said two people with knowledge of the work.  Light Products  BP bought a  naphtha  cargo from Trafigura Beheer BV at
$1,009 a metric ton, according to a survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window. That compares with
a trade at $1,053 on April 10.  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent shrank to $5.40 a barrel as of
1:46 p.m. London time from $5.56 yesterday, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a U.K. broker.  Gasoline for immediate loading in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-
Antwerp region traded from $1,104 to $1,126 a ton, according to
a similar survey of the Argus Bulletin Board. That’s within
yesterday’s range of $1,097 to $1,137. The trades are for
Eurobob grade to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.  Gasoline’s  premium  to  Brent crude  fell to $12.42 a barrel
from $12.68 yesterday, PVM data shows.  Middle Distillates  BP bought the cargo from Shell for delivery to Koper in
Slovenia, partly priced at a premium of $13 a ton to the ICE
low-sulfur gasoil contract, according to the survey of Platts.
That compares with an April 16 deal at $12 to the U.K.  Diesel barges changed hands at premiums of $19 to $20.50 a
ton to May gasoil, the survey showed.  Gasoil for delivery in May gained 1.1 percent to $996.50 a
ton as of 5:05 p.m. London time on ICE. The contract earlier
rose to as much as $1,001.  May’s premium to June widened to $4.50 a ton, the most for
front-month contracts since mid-February, excluding expiry day
anomalies. That keeps the market in backwardation for a fifth
day, a price structure where near-term supplies are more
expensive than later-dated shipments and can signal an increase
in immediate demand or fall in supply.  “ICE gasoil is trying to regain the $1,000 a ton level and
that will be a resistance to watch as the backwardation in ICE
gasoil is starting to increase,”  Olivier Jakob , managing
director of Switzerland-based consultant Petromatrix GmbH, said
today in a note. Front-month futures traded at more than $1,000
a ton today for the first time in three days.  Stockpiles fell 0.5 percent to 2.61 million tons in the
week to today, according to PJK International BV.  Gasoil’s crack fell to $14.83 a barrel versus $15.15 at
4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent crude advanced 0.2 percent to $118.16
a barrel.  Gasoil  barges  traded at discounts of $1 and $3 a ton to
futures prices, according to the survey. That compares with a
deal yesterday at $2.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil traded from $675.25 to $677 a ton, up
from $669.25 to $672 yesterday, the survey of Platts showed. The
low sulfur grade traded at $729 a ton.  Fuel oil  stockpiles fell to a three-month low this week as
a cargo was shipped to  Singapore , according to PJK. The stocks
dropped 24 percent to 598,000 tons, the lowest since Jan. 12.  Refineries  A platformer and hydro-desulfurization unit 3 at Shell’s
Pernis refinery are resuming operations while maintenance on HDS
1 and HDS 2 will begin early next week, the people said,
declining to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak publicly on the matter. The work on HDS 3 started in late
March and repairs on the other HDS units will last until May 27,
one of the people said.  Russian refiners shut at least 786,000 barrels a day of
crude distillation capacity as of April 13, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on an e-mail from the Russian
Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit.  To contact the reporters on this story:
