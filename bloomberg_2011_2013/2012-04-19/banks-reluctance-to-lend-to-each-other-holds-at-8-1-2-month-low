European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held at the lowest level in 8 1/2 months,
according to a money-market indicator.  The  Euribor-OIS spread , the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was little
changed at 40 basis points at 8:30 a.m. in  London , data compiled
by Bloomberg show. The measure has fallen from 95 at the start
of the year to the lowest since Aug. 1.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars fell for the third day to the lowest in 8 1/2 months.
The three-month cross-currency  basis swap  was 48 basis points
below Euribor from minus 49 basis points yesterday. The cost is
the lowest since Aug. 1.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 55 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  Lenders’ cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central
Bank yesterday, placing 757 billion euros ($994 billion) with
