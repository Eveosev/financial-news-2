Agrobanka AD (AGBN) , the unprofitable
Serbian bank that was placed in receivership four months ago,
failed to name new auditors after government representatives did
not show up for a shareholders meeting.  “Shareholders representing 30.4 percent of the bank’s
equity could not make any decisions today as no one from the
 Finance Ministry  showed up,” Branislav Bogdanovic, the chairman
of  AC Broker , a Belgrade-based brokerage representing mainly
foreign institutional investors, said in a phone interview
today. No one at the Finance Ministry responded to calls from
Bloomberg.  The meeting was called by Agrobanka’s administrators for
shareholders to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers offices in
Belgrade and  Prague  to do a new audit of the bank’s 2010 and
2011 financial statements. The bank, in which the government
holds a 20 percent stake, had an unaudited 2011 loss of 29.7
billion dinars ($349.4 million).  The Belgrade bourse reported no trade in Agrobanka’s shares
today. The share price of 1,042 dinars at yesterday’s close was
70 percent lower than on Dec. 29 when the central bank fired
Agrobanka’a management after inspectors discovered its capital
didn’t match the risk it had assumed with its business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
