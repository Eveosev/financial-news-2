  Penn National Gaming Inc. (PENN)  gained
the most in six weeks after the operator of casinos reported
first-quarter profit and revenue that topped analysts’
estimates, helped by a mild winter on the East Coast.  The  shares  advanced 2.9 percent to $44.54 at the close in
New York, the biggest rise since March 7. They have advanced 17
percent this year.  Temperatures above the season’s average in the East and a
rebound in  consumer spending  drove earnings growth. Profit
excluding certain items rose to 73 cents a share, Wyomissing,
Pennsylvania-based Penn National said, topping the 60 cent
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income increased 53 percent to $78.6 million, or 74
cents a share, from $51.5 million, or 48 cents, a year earlier,
the company said in a statement today. Revenue rose 10 percent
to $736.1 million. Analysts had predicted sales of $705.5
million.  Penn National  forecast  earnings of 64 cents a share for the
second quarter. Analysts  estimate  62 cents on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
