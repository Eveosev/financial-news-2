(Corrects date of e-mail in the first paragraph.)  Google Inc. (GOOG)  engineer Tim Lindholm
testified that the “license” he wrote about in a 2010 e-mail
didn’t refer to Sun Microsystems Inc.’s Java license.  Lindholm testified at a trial in federal court in San
Francisco in  Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ’s lawsuit against Google claiming the
leading search engine operator stole Java software technology in
creating its Android operating system. Oracle acquired Sun in
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
