Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6) ,
Latin America’s largest utility by market value, said it’s
considering building a 1,500 megawatt hydropower plant and two
transmission lines in northern Mozambique at a cost of $6
billion.  The 1,500-kilometer (932-mile) “high-voltage” power lines
will be built in partnership with state-owned Electricidade de
Mocambique, Jose da Costa, president of the Brazilian utility,
said in a  statement  on the company’s website. Studies on how to
finance the project and the impact it will have on the
environment will be ready next year, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
