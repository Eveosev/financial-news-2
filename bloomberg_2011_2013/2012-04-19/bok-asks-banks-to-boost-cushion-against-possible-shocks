The  Bank of Korea  asked domestic
banks to boost their capability to cope with possible shocks.  “Banks must reinforce their recapitalization drives in
preparation for unforeseen domestic and external shocks,” the
central bank said in a report to the  National Assembly  today.  Efforts by domestic banks to boost their ability to handle
unexpected events by retaining profits are seen as having fallen
short because they’ve paid relatively high dividends compared
with other domestic companies and their peers in major emerging
market countries, the BOK said.  Foreign currency liquidity conditions for Korean banks
could deteriorate if European-based financial institutions
proceed with large-scale deleveraging, the BOK said.  The BOK called for policy actions to address the household
debt issue because some borrowers, especially low-income
earners, may fail to repay their debt in the event of a shock
such as a decline in  house prices .  The central bank reiterated its commitment to conduct
monetary policy to “firmly anchor”  price stability  in the
medium term amid continuing sound economic growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
