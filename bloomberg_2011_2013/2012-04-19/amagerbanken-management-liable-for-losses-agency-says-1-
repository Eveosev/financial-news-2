Denmark’s state resolution agency
said it agreed with a government-appointed commission’s findings
that former executives in Amagerbanken A/S should be held
accountable for the regional lender’s collapse.  “The Financial Stability Co. has decided that compensation
claims ought to be raised against the former management and
board of Amagerbanken,” it said in an e-mailed statement today.  In a separate action, the state’s financial regulator
reported seven banks to police for failing to give loan
customers sufficient information. The Financial Supervisory
Authority made the allegations after reviewing 30 lenders’
websites for regulatory compliance. Nine lenders already have
been cited.  To contact the reporter on this story:
