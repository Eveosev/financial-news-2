Moody’s Corp. (MCO) ’s board elected lead
independent director Henry A. McKinnell as chairman and added
president to Chief Executive Officer Ray McDaniel’s title.  McKinnell has served on the board since the New York-based
company went public in 2000, Moody’s said in a statement today.
He joined the credit-rating company’s directors from the board
of  Dun & Bradstreet Corp. (DNB) , Moody’s former parent. Moody’s
shareholders voted last year to have separate positions for
chairman and CEO whenever possible, and the company adopted that
protocol earlier this year, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
