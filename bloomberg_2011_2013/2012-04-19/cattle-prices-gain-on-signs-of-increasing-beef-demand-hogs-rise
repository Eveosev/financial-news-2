Cattle futures climbed for the
third time this week on signs of increasing demand for U.S.
beef. Hogs also advanced.  Wholesale-beef  prices  jumped 1.2 percent to $1.8576 a pound
yesterday, the highest since March 26 and the fourth straight
increase, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. Meatpackers
processed an estimated 347,000 head of cattle this week through
yesterday, up 3.3 percent from the same period a week earlier,
USDA data show.  “Boxed beef has been doing fine,”  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis ,
said in a telephone interview. Current meat prices may allow
processors to buy more cattle and bid more for available supply,
he said.  Cattle futures for June delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$1.15425 a pound at 10:13 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Before today, prices retreated 5.5 percent this year.  Spot-steer  prices  averaged $1.22 a pound in the first two
days of this week, up 1.8 percent from the same period a week
earlier, government data show.  Hog futures for June settlement increased 0.6 percent to
87.875 cents a pound in Chicago. Before today, prices rose 3.6
percent this year.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement fell less than
0.1 percent to $1.55475 a pound in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
