Finnair Oyj (FIA1S)  should compensate
passengers whose flights were rescheduled due to an airport
strike, a European Union court aide said.  Yves Bot, an advocate general to the EU’s Court of Justice,
said a carrier should only be exempted from paying compensation
for refusing a passenger from boarding if the passenger is to
blame for reasons such as drunkenness, violence or presenting
invalid travel documents.  Timy Lassooy is seeking 400 euros ($525) from Finnair in
compensation for being bumped off a morning flight from
 Barcelona  to Helsinki in July 2006. Finnair put him on an
evening flight the same day after using the morning flight to
accommodate passengers delayed by a Barcelona airport strike two
days earlier.  “The denial of boarding to passengers may be justified
solely on grounds relating to the personal situation of those
passengers,” according to a statement from the court. Refusing
Lassooy compensation for a rescheduled flight would leave him
“abandoned to his fate, which would be totally contrary to the
objective of European legislation which is to ensure a high-
level of protection for air passengers.”  Although the advocate general’s opinion isn’t binding, it
is followed by the court in the majority of cases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
