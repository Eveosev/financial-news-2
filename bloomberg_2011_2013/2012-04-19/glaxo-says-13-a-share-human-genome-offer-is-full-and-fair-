GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  said its offer
for  Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI)  represents “full and fair
value” and would deliver an “immediate and certain” benefit
beyond what Human Genome can create as a stand-alone company.  “We are disappointed that Human Genome Sciences has
rejected our offer without discussion and are confident that our
offer is in the best interest of shareholders of both
companies,” Glaxo Chief Executive Officer Andrew Witty said
today in a statement.  “Now is the appropriate time in the evolution of our
relationship for our two companies to combine,” Witty said.
“GSK is uniquely positioned to realize the full value of
Benlysta, albiglutide, darapladib and Human Genome Sciences’s
other assets for the benefit of physicians, patients and
shareholders.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
