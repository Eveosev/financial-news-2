The Czech Republic’s  PX (PX)  stock index
dropped 0.5 percent to 917.8 at its close in Prague, snapping
two days of losses.  The following were among the most active  equities  on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  New World Resources Plc (NWR)  , a Czech mining company,
fell 1.6 percent to 125.5 koruna, its lowest close since April
10.  Europe ’s benchmark  coal  futures contracts slipped for a
fifth day.  Orco Property Group SA (ORCO)   fell for a second day on
concern a debt-to-equity conversion approved by some bondholders
yesterday will dilute share value. The developer overhauling its
debt under a court-approved plan lost 2 percent to 84.5 koruna.  To contact the reporter on this story:
