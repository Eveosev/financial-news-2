The Bovespa index dropped for the
first time in three days as higher-than-forecast U.S. jobless
claims spurred concern the recovery in  Brazil ’s second-biggest
trading partner will falter.  Oil companies OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA and
Petroleo Brasileiro SA contributed the most to the gauge’s drop,
following crude lower. Tobacco company Souza Cruz SA led gains
by consumer stocks after the Brazilian central bank signaled it
may keep cutting borrowing costs.  The Bovespa slid 0.6 percent to 62,618.41 at the close in
 Sao Paulo . Thirty-six stocks fell on the gauge while 29 climbed.
The real weakened 0.2 percent to 1.8815 per  U.S. dollar  at 5:25
p.m. local time.  “The short-term outlook is not that positive, as
commodities producers, which account for almost half the index,
suffer with the signs of slower growth in the world economy,”
Jose Luiz Garcia, who helps manage 3.2 billion reais ($1.7
billion) at Mercatto Gestao de Recursos, said by phone from  Rio
de Janeiro . “The main risks for the equity market come from
abroad.”  A U.S. Labor Department report showed jobless claims fell
by 2,000 to 386,000 in the week ended April 14, compared with
the median forecast for a drop to 370,000.  Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro is known, slid 1.4
percent to 21.45 reais. OGX sank 3.6 percent to 12.96 reais.  Redecard SA, the card-payment processor that Itau Unibanco
Holding SA is seeking to buy out, lost 0.9 percent to 32.15
reais after Banco BTG Pactual SA lowered its recommendation to
the equivalent of hold.  ‘Limited Upside’  Redecard offers “limited upside” as the stock trades near
the 35-reais price that Itau offered to pay for the shares it
doesn’t own in the company, BTG Pactual’s analysts Marcelo Henriques and Eduardo Rosman wrote in a note to clients.  Aliansce Shopping Centers SA advanced 0.7 percent to 17.79
reais. The company said sales in stores located in malls it owns
rose 15 percent to 1.2 billion reais in the first quarter.  The  Bovespa (IBOV)  earlier gained as much as 0.4 percent after the
central bank’s Monetary Policy Committee said risks of missing
its 4.5 percent target for annual inflation are “limited” as
the global outlook remains “disinflationary.” Its statement
accompanied a decision last night to lower the target lending
rate 75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage point, to 9 percent.  Souza Cruz advanced 1.9 percent to 29 reais, the highest
since at least January 1994. Brazilian drugstore operator Raia
Drogasil SA rose 2.7 percent to a record 20 reais.  Interest-Rate Futures  In the Brazilian interest-rate futures market, yields on
most contracts slumped. The yield on the contract due in January
dropped 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 8.42
percent.  Brazil’s benchmark equity  gauge  has gained 10 percent this
year, buoyed by local interest-rate cuts, signs of expansion in
the U.S. and speculation  Europe  may be closer to resolving its
debt crisis. The gauge trades at 10.4 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, in line with the 10.4 ratio for MSCI Inc.’s measure
of 21 developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Traders  moved  5.65 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
today data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 7.11 billion reais this year through April 12,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
