Japanese banks would face a total
of 6.4 trillion yen ($79 billion) in valuation losses on their
holdings of  government bonds  if  Japan ’s interest rates increased
1 percentage point, the  Bank of Japan (8301)  said in its semi-annual
financial system report.  Possible losses at major banks would total 3.4 trillion yen,
while those at regional banks would amount to 3 trillion yen,
the bank said, citing its own estimates based on data to Dec. 31.  The average maturity of Japanese debt held by large lenders
is about 2.5 years and about 4 years for regional banks,
according to the report.  The yield on Japan’s benchmark 10-year bonds today rose
half a basis point to 0.94 percent, after hitting a 17-month low
of 0.93 percent earlier this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
