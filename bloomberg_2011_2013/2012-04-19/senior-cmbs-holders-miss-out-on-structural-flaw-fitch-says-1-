Holders of senior commercial
mortgage-backed bonds aren’t getting paid what they’re owed
because of a breakdown in the subordination of many
transactions, according to  Fitch Ratings .  Cash recovered from defaulted loans is often allocated to
pay interest to all classes of bondholders before top-ranked
investors are paid their principal, analysts Emmnanuel Baah and
Euan Gatfield wrote in a report today.  “A portion of junior bond interest will be paid in
priority to senior principal, even at the risk of a final senior
principal deficiency,” the analysts wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
