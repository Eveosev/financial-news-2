The European Investment Bank, the
lending arm of the European Union, may lend Slovenia’s  Nova
Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d. 100 million euros ($131 million) to
support companies and help spur the economy.  The loan “would promote medium and long-term lending for
 capital investment  contributing to strengthening the
productivity and competitiveness of small and medium-sized
companies,” the Luxembourg-based bank said on its website. EIB
spokesman Dusan Ondrejicka declined to say when the  credit line 
would be approved as “the bank never comments until the loan
agreement is signed,” he said in a phone interview today.  Nova Kreditna and its larger rival, Nova Ljubljanska Banka
d.d., need to boost their capital and clean their balance sheets
after the financial system in Slovenia was “strongly” affected
by the financial crisis, the  International Monetary Fund  said
April 16.  Nova Kreditna, Slovenia’s second-biggest bank by assets,
said its 2011 loss was much larger than previously reported and
amounted to 81 million euros, it said April 17.  NLB must raise 400 million euros of equity capital by the
end of June to improve its core Tier 1 ratio to above 9 percent
as demanded by the country’s central bank and the European
Banking Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
