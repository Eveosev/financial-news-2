Turkish authorities today will
search a Syria-bound ship that’s carrying explosives, Aksam
 reported .  The German-owned vessel changed course and docked at
 Turkey ’s southern port of Iskenderun after coming within 80
kilometers (50 miles) of the Syrian port of Tartus, according to
the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Turkey’s Foreign Ministry, aided by customs and police
forces, seized documents from the ship during a brief visit
yesterday, when they also identified explosives, military
equipment and four other types of cargo, Aksam reported. Customs
officers told the newspaper they requested that the military
material be unloaded at Iskenderun. The ministry’s press office
didn’t immediately respond to phone calls and  text messages 
seeking comment on the report.  The European Union has imposed an arms embargo, among other
sanctions, on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in
response to a crackdown on dissent in which the  United Nations 
estimates more than 9,000 people have died in the last 13
months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
