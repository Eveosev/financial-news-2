(Corrects date in first paragraph.)  Former Myanmar political prisoner
 Aung San Suu Kyi  plans to travel to the U.K. and  Norway  in her
first overseas trip since returning to her homeland in 1988 to
care for her ailing mother.  The details of the trip are still being worked out, Nyan Win, a spokesman for her National League for Democracy party,
said by telephone today. U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
invited Suu Kyi to visit Britain in June during a visit last
week to her lakeside home in Yangon, Myanmar’s biggest city.  Suu Kyi, 66, won a seat in Parliament during April 1 by-
elections in which her party won 43 of 45 legislative seats up
for grabs. The vote, part of President Thein Sein’s efforts to
shift Myanmar toward democracy, prompted U.S. and European Union
leaders to advocate for easing sanctions against the former
military dictatorship.  General Aung San, Suu Kyi’s father who led the fight for
independence from Britain in the 1940s, was assassinated when
she was two years old. Suu Kyi went on to study at Oxford
University, married a British citizen and had two children while
living in the U.K.  Her return to Myanmar in 1988 coincided with an uprising
against military rulers that started her political career. She
spent 15 years under house arrest from 1989, winning the Nobel
Peace Prize in that time for her non-violent struggle.  To contact the reporter on this story:
