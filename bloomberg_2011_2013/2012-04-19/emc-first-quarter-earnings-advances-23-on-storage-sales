EMC Corp. (EMC) , the world’s biggest
maker of storage computers, said first-quarter profit rose 23
percent as companies housed increasing volumes of data and
purchased more software from majority-owned  VMware Inc. (VMW)   Net income  advanced to $586.8 million, or 27 cents a  share ,
from $477.1 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier, the Hopkinton,
Massachusetts-based company said today in a statement. Excluding
some items, profit was 37 cents, compared with the 36-cent
average of analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  EMC is benefiting as customers buy more of its storage
software, including products from the Isilon unit it acquired in
2010 in its biggest-ever acquisition, Alex Kurtz, an analyst at
Sterne Agee, said in a note last week. EMC said it will “meet
or potentially exceed” its prior full-year 2012 forecasts for
revenue and profit.  “Investors had hoped for a potential raise,” in the 2012
forecast, said  Mark Moskowitz , an analyst at JPMorgan & Chase
Co. in  San Francisco , in a report today. “No change to outlook
could be a jump ball.”  EMC’s shares fell 3.7 percent to $28.07 at 9:56 a.m. in  New
York , after earlier touching $27.86 for the biggest decline
since Dec. 21 They had risen 35 percent this year before today.  2012 Forecast  The company in January  forecast  of full-year 2012 revenue
of $22 billion and profit excluding some items of $1.70 a share.
That compares with an average analyst estimate of $22.2 billion
and profit of $1.75 a share, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  First-quarter  sales  advanced 11 percent to $5.09 billion,
compared with the $5.11 billion average  estimate .  EMC’s results in the quarter were also helped by corporate
spending on VMware’s virtualization software to cut costs by
putting multiple applications on a single server computer.  VMware, the biggest maker of software that lets computers
run multiple operating systems, yesterday reported profit of 66
cents, excluding some items, exceeding the 60-cent average
estimate. Sales rose to $1.06 billion from $843.7 million,
topping the $1.03 billion average prediction.  VMWare’s shares rose 6.1 percent to $118.03. The stock
advanced 34 percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
