European stocks  fell for a second
day as reports showed that sales of previously owned houses
dropped and more Americans than forecast filed claims for
 unemployment benefits .  Publicis Groupe SA (PUB)  dropped as France’s largest advertising
company said growth will slow this quarter. Nokia Oyj tumbled to
a 15-year low after reporting an operating loss of 1.34 billion
euros ($1.8 billion).  SKF AB (SKFA) , the world’s biggest maker of ball
bearings, rose 4.9 percent after forecasting higher sales in the
U.S. and Asia.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  retreated 0.5 percent to 256.51
at the close, after earlier rallying as much as 1 percent. The
gauge has  lost 2.6 percent so far in April  on renewed concern
that the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis will worsen. The
Stoxx 600 has still  advanced 4.9 percent this year .  “U.S. data continued to disappoint today,” said Craig
Erlam, a London-based market analyst at Alpari U.K. “The data
wiped out any gains made in the morning from the successful
Spanish bond auction. Sentiment is low and it won’t take much to
restart the down trend.”  National benchmark indexes fell in 14 of the 17 western-
European markets that were open today.  France ’s CAC 40 Index
declined 2.1 percent and  Germany ’s DAX Index declined 0.9
percent. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index lost less than 0.1 percent.
Spain’s IBEX 35 Index retreated 2.4 percent to extend a three-
year low.  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was
8.8 percent higher than the average of the last 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark measure
retreated 0.7 percent yesterday, paring the gauge’s 2 percent
jump on April 17.  U.S. Jobless Claims  In the U.S., a Labor Department report showed  jobless
claims  fell to 386,000 from a revised 388,000 the previous week
that was higher than initially estimated. The  median forecast  of
47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had called for a drop
to 370,000.  A separate release showed that  sales of previously owned
houses  unexpectedly dropped in March. Purchases declined to a
4.48 million annual rate from 4.6 million in February. That
missed the  median estimate  of 72 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey for an increase to sales of 4.61 million.  Stocks initially rallied after  Spain  sold 2.54 billion
euros of two- and 10-year bonds at an auction, meeting the
government’s maximum target of 2.5 billion euros. France also
raised 10.5 billion euros of debt out of a planned 11 billion
euros today as risks linked to the country’s presidential
election drove up yields.  Agence France Tresor, the country’s debt-management body,
auctioned 2.7 billion euros of benchmark five-year debt at an
average yield of 1.83 percent, compared with 1.78 percent on
March 15.  European Borrowing Costs  Both countries have come under increased scrutiny from
investors as the effect of the  European Central Bank ’s longer-
term refinancing operation fades. The ECB has injected 1
trillion euros of liquidity into the region’s financial system.  The yield on Spain’s benchmark 10-year bond has jumped as
much as 1 percentage point since the beginning of March, while
the yield on the equivalent French security has gained about 10
basis points.  Publicis, Chr. Hansen  Publicis sank 4.1 percent to 38.48 euros in Paris. The
company said sales growth will slow after it lost a contract for
General Motors Co. and as some clients cut spending.  First-
quarter sales  rose 13 percent to 1.45 billion euros from a year
earlier, Publicis said. Excluding acquisitions, sales grew 4.1
percent.  Nokia declined 3.6 percent to 2.92 euros, its lowest price
since 1997, after the company reported a first-quarter operating
loss, burdened by costs at the unprofitable equipment venture
with Siemens AG.  The loss includes 1.1 billion euros in one-off charges, of
which 772 million euros were for Nokia Siemens Networks. Revenue
fell 29 percent to 7.35 billion euros, the lowest since 2004, as
handset sales slumped in emerging markets and margins in
smartphones shrank.  SKF jumped 4.9 percent to 165.50 kronor, its biggest gain
in six weeks, after the world’s largest maker of ball bearings
said that  sales  rose 1.4 percent to 16.9 billion kronor ($2.5
billion) in the first quarter.  In the second quarter, “the main growth will be in the
Americas, but we also expect a continued improvement in  Asia  and
a stable development in  Europe ,” Chief Executive Officer Tom Johnstone said in a statement.  GlaxoSmithKline Advances  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  gained 0.9 percent to 1,454 pence after
Human Genome Sciences Inc. rejected an unsolicited $2.59 billion
offer from the U.K.’s largest drugmaker.  The U.S.-based company said that Glaxo’s $13-a-share cash
offer failed to reflect the company’s value.  Chr. Hansen A/S, the maker of natural food colors and
cheese cultures, surged 7.5 percent to 155.50 kroner, the
highest price since its public relisting in June 2010. Chief
Executive Officer Lars Frederiksen said that the company will
buy back as much as 80 million euros of shares after failing to
find any acquisition targets.  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD) , the second-biggest U.K. betting group,
soared 6.5 percent to 173.4 pence after predicting profit growth
in its digital offering in the second half of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
