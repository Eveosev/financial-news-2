Vietnam ’s five-year bonds rose for
a fourth day, sending yields to a 17-month low, on speculation a
decline in money-market rates will bolster demand for debt. The
dong fell.  Yields on debt due in 2017 fell the most since February
today. The benchmark  overnight rate  in the nation’s interbank
money market dropped 1.13 percentage points this week to 5.82
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, signaling an
increase in funds in the financial system. That’s the lowest
level since October 2009. The measure was at 11.8 percent at the
end of 2011.  “Interbank rates have dropped sharply, so banks have
surplus cash to invest in bonds, making the debt more
attractive,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based
analyst at Viet Capital Securities Co.  The  yield  on five-year bonds fell 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, to 10.93 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That was the lowest level
since November, 2010.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 20,838 per dollar as of
3:36 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank set the currency’s reference rate at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, its website showed. The currency is
allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the
official fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
