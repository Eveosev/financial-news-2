Telenor ASA (TEL) , the Nordic region’s
largest phone company, said it complied with Russian law in
buying a stake in  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  from Weather Investments II
S.a.r.l. and intends to defend its position.  The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service filed a claim
asking Telenor to return the 234 million VimpelCom preferred
shares it bought from Weather for $374.4 million on Feb. 15,
Telenor said in a statement, adding that it has not been
formally notified of the claim. The FAS is also filing an
injunction to keep Telenor from voting with the shares in the
meantime, it said.  Telenor bought the stake to maintain its ownership level
after VimpelCom,  Russia ’s third largest phone company, merged
with Wind Telecom SpA. The FAS claims that the sale breached the
law on foreign ownership of Russian strategic assets, VimpelCom,
which is named as a third party in the claim, said in a
statement yesterday. Telenor said the purchase, which brought it
to 36.36 percent of the voting share, returned it to the
ownership level it had before the Wind merger.  “There has not been any change of control in VimpelCom,
nor is there any agreement between Telenor and Weather
Invetments concerning control of VimpelCom,” Telenor spokesman
 Dag Melgaard  said in the statement. “We are open to a dialogue
with the FAS, but we will defend Telenor’s position using all
available remedies under applicable law and treaties.”  Telenor shares traded down 0.2 percent in Oslo to 101.2
kroner at 9:20 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
