U.S. Gulf Coast oil premiums gained
as the gap between West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude
widened for a second consecutive day.  Brent’s premium over WTI, based on June futures prices,
widened 31 cents to $15.16 a barrel at 1:02 p.m. in  New York .
When Brent increases versus WTI, it typically boosts the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to West Texas Intermediate
added $1.25 to $18.25 a barrel at 12:03 p.m. New York time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet
increased $1.20 to a premium of $17.25 a barrel.  Thunder Horse ’s premium gained $2.15 to $14.85 a barrel
over WTI, and Mars Blend added $1.75 to a premium of $11.75.
Poseidon’s premium increased $2.45 to $10.75, while Southern
Green Canyon’s widened $1.75 to $9.75.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI was unchanged at
$16.60 a barrel, Syncrude’s discount was steady at 75 cents and
Bakken oil’s discount was unchanged at $6.50.  To contact the reporter on this story:
