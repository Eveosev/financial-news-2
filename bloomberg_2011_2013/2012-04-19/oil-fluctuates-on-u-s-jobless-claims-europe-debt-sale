Oil declined in  New York  as more
Americans than forecast filed  applications  for unemployment
benefits and sales of previously owned homes fell, adding to
concern that the U.S. recovery is stalling.  Futures dropped 0.4 percent after the Labor Department said
jobless claims decreased by 2,000 to 386,000 last week. The
 median  forecast of 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called
for 370,000. Purchases fell 2.6 percent to a 4.48 million annual
rate from 4.6 million in February, the National Association of
Realtors reported in  Washington .  “The jobless claims combined with the housing numbers are
evidence that the economy is still struggling a bit,” said  Phil Flynn , vice president of research at futures brokerage PFGBest
in  Chicago . “The economy is growing but it’s very uneven.”  Crude oil for May delivery declined 40 cents to $102.27 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since April 10. Prices are down 5.4 percent from a
year ago.  Brent oil for June settlement increased 3 cents to end the
session at $118 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange.  The European benchmark contract’s front-month premium to
New York-traded West Texas Intermediate for June delivery
widened for a second day, reaching $15.28. The spread narrowed
to $14.14 on April 17 based on settlement prices, the lowest
level since Feb. 1.  Jobless Claims  The Labor Department revised the previous week’s jobless
claims figure to 388,000 from 380,000. Employers added 120,000
jobs in March, half as many as in February and the fewest in
five months, according to payrolls figures released on April 6.
The jobless rate fell to 8.2 percent, a three-year low.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  were both down 0.6 percent at 3:51 p.m. in
New York.  “The crude oil market tends to interpret economic data
through the lens of the S&P,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst
at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. “If the S&P is down,
chances are crude will be as well.”  Brent oil climbed earlier as Spain and France met their
maximum targets by selling 13.05 billion euros ($17 billion) in
debt, and a projection of German economic growth increased.  “You are seeing greater strength in Brent than WTI because
of the Spanish debt auction,” said Chris Dillman, an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  European Crisis  Oil prices have moved for more than two years on the latest
developments in the euro region’s debt crisis and its projected
impact on the continent’s energy demand. The crisis that began
in Greece has spread to Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain.  The U.S. was responsible for 21 percent of global oil
demand in 2010, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of
World Energy released in June. The 17 countries using the euro
accounted for about 12 percent of world use.  Oil in New York reached $110.55 on March 1, the highest
intraday level since May 4, amid speculation that Western
sanctions aimed at halting Iran’s nuclear program will disrupt
Middle East shipments. Prices have dropped 7.5 percent since
that peak as tensions have eased.  The first international talks in 15 months on Iran’s
nuclear program, held April 14 in Istanbul, were called
“constructive” by both  Catherine Ashton , the European Union’s
foreign policy chief, and Iran’s lead negotiator, Saeed Jalili.
The United Nations’ five permanent Security Council members plus
 Germany  will are scheduled to meet Iranian delegates on May 23.  “The oil market is in a bearish trend,” said  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group in Villanova,
 Pennsylvania . “Prices surged above $110 not long ago on fears
about a conflict with  Iran . We’re now seeing the Iran premium
slowly bleed away.”  Gasoline Market  Gasoline dropped to a seven-week low today on speculation
that a slowing economy will reduce motor-fuel demand. The drop
helped pull crude oil lower. An Energy Department report
yesterday showed that consumption of the fuel last week was down
3.2 percent from a year earlier.  “All the action is in gasoline today,” Evans said.
“There are concerns that demand won’t pick up.”  Gasoline for May delivery decreased 4.86 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.1541 a gallon in New York, the lowest settlement
since Feb. 29. Futures climbed to $3.4166 on March 26, the
highest level since April 29, 2011.  Electronic trading volume of crude oil on the Nymex was
456,804 contracts as of 3:51 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled
632,816 contracts yesterday, 1.1 percent below the three-month
average. Open interest was 1.56 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
