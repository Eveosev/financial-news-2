Atletico Madrid  and Sporting Lisbon
won at home to open the semifinals of soccer’s Europa League.  Radamel Falcao got two goals to help 2010 champion Atletico
beat Valencia 4-2 last night. Emiliano Insua and Diego Capel
scored in the final 14 minutes as Sporting rallied to beat
Athletic Bilbao 2-1.  Bilbao and Valencia will host the return matches in Spain
on April 26. The winners over two games will meet in the final
of  Europe ’s second-tier club competition May 9 in Bucharest.  Historically in Europe, a 4-2 home victory in the opening
match has given teams a 70 percent chance of winning over two
games, according to Infostrada Sports. Teams leading 2-1 after
their home match have advanced 48 percent of the time.  Falcao opened the scoring in  Madrid  in the 18th minute and
Jonas tied the game in first-half injury time. Miranda, Adrian
Lopez and Falcao then scored in the second half before
Valencia’s Ricardo Costa netted in injury time.  Falcao now has 10 goals to tie Schalke’s Klaas-Jan Huntelaar for the competition lead. The Colombian joined
Atletico after scoring a record 17 goals to lead Porto to last
season’s Europa League title.  In Portugal, defender Jon Aurtenetxe put Bilbao in front in
the 54th minute. Insua pulled Sporting even with a header in the
76th minute and Capel won the game four minutes later with a
shot from 25 yards out (23 meters).  To contact the reporter on this story:
