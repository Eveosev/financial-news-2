The cost of insuring against
default on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according
to BNP Paribas SA.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments fell 3.5 basis points to 276.5
at 8:16 a.m. in London. A decline signals improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 9.5
basis points to 663.5. The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
companies with investment-grade ratings fell two basis points to
140 basis points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell 2.5 basis points to 247.5 and the
subordinated index declined five to 405.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.1 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
