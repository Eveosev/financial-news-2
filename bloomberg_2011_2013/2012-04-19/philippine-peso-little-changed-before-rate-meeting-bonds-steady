The Philippine peso rose toward a
two-week high on speculation its yield premium will remain
attractive to foreign investors as the central bank halts its
interest-rate cutting cycle. Bonds fell.  Policy makers held the rate paid to lenders for overnight
deposits at 4 percent, the central bank said in a statement
after the market closed. The decision was predicted by all 17
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Philippine 10-year bonds
 yield  384 basis points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries.  “The rate differential won’t narrow anymore,” said
Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore. “That
will keep the peso on a stronger footing.”  The peso closed 0.1 percent higher at 42.618 per dollar in
 Manila , compared with 42.655 yesterday, according to Tullett
Prebon Plc. The currency touched 42.560 yesterday, the highest
level since April 3. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, was steady
at 5.40 percent.  “A prudent pause allows policy makers to better assess how
the upside and downside risks to inflation will play out,”
central bank Governor Amando Tetangco said today. Inflation is
targeted between 3 percent and 5 percent this year.  The yield on the government’s 5 percent bonds due August
2018 increased five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to
4.95 percent, according to prices from Tradition Financial
Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
