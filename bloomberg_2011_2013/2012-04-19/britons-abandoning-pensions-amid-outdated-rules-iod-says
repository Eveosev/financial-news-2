The U.K.’s “outdated” regulations
on pensions are driving Britons away from using them to save for
retirement, the Institute of Directors said.  While annual investment in pensions fell 11 percent to 22.9
billion pounds ($37 billion) between 2007 and 2009,
contributions to tax-exempt Individual Savings Accounts had
increased to almost 54 billion pounds by April 2011, Malcolm Small, senior adviser at the London-based business lobby, said
in a report today.  The report includes a call to increase the state retirement
age to 68 by 2032 instead of 2046 and to 70 in 2044. Chancellor
of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said last month he’ll simplify
the tax system for pensioners and introduce a single-tier
pension for future retirees above the level of the means test.  The shift to ISAs is “a stark illustration that the
current architecture has lost public confidence,” Small said in
the statement. “A simpler system, a higher state-retirement age
and a proper savings policy would at least provide the
foundations for a new retirement savings architecture.”  Investment in pensions has fallen from a peak of 25.6
billion pounds in 2007, according to the IoD. Contributions to
ISAs climbed to 53.8 billion pounds in the 2010-11 tax year from
35.7 billion pounds in 2007.  Insurance firms Capita Hartshead and Lucida also
contributed to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
