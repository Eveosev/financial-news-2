The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  may
be in the midst of a slide of almost 10 percent, Oppenheimer &
Co. said, citing the average size of previous market dips since
the current bull market began.  The benchmark gauge has staged retreats of 4 percent or
more on 11 occasions since March 2009, for an average decline of
9.7 percent, according to data compiled by Oppenheimer. The S&P
500 fell 4.6 percent on an intraday basis in the five days of
trading following April 2, when the current decline started. The
slumps typically last three to four weeks, the data show.  Carter Worth, New York-based chief market technician at
Oppenheimer, said the S&P 500 may approach 1,340. That would
erase almost  a quarter  of the index’s 320-point gain from its
October low through early April. The index reached its 2012 high
of 1,419.04 on April 2 and closed at 1,385.14 yesterday after
rebounding from a trend line drawn from the intraday low of Oct.
4.  “We’re on the mattress and we’ve sunk to support,” Worth
said in a telephone interview. “I think we’ll sink further.”  Equity gains stalled this month after the  S&P 500  jumped 12
percent in the biggest first-quarter rally since 1998. The
benchmark index had its first back-to-back weekly decline since
November last week as U.S. jobs data missed economists’
forecasts and concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing
global economic growth.  The falling trend in the market has offset the effects of
better-that-forecast earnings at companies with larger market
values, Worth said.  Intel Corp. (INTC)  and  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  fell
1.8 and 3.6 percent, respectively, on the trading days
immediately after the release of earnings that exceeded average
analyst estimates.  “Things are tired,” Worth said. “These companies have
been priced in a lot. The market, having advanced so deeply, has
discounted the news that is now coming.”  The two biggest declines since the start of the current
 bull market  have occured during the second and third quarters.
The S&P 500 declined 17 percent over a nine-week period from
April 2010 to July 2010. The benchmark also plunged 21 percent
during a 12-week span from July 2011 to October 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
