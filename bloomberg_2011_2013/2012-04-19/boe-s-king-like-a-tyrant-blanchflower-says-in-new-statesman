Bank of England Governor Mervyn
King runs the country’s central bank like a tyrant and his
retirement should pave the way for a cleaning out and the
introduction of fresh blood, former Monetary Policy Committee
member  David Blanchflower  wrote in the  New Statesman .  “It’s never easy replacing a tyrant but there are huge
benefits from doing so. The pain is usually worth it,”
Blanchflower wrote.  “A tyrant looks to his own advantage rather than that of
his subjects and uses extreme and cruel tactics - which
pretty much sums up how I feel Mervyn King has run the Bank of
England in his role as governor since 2003,'’ Blanchflower, now a
professor of economics at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.  He said his preference as a replacement would be a
‘‘heavyweight’’ banker, such as former HSBC Plc chairman Stephen
Green, now a minister of state, or  John Varley , former chief
executive officer of Barclays Plc. Former cabinet secretary Gus
O’Donnell should also be considered, he wrote.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
