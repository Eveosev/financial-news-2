China ’s State  Food and Drug
Administration  told its provincial units to shut down plants
making drug capsules containing excessive levels of chromium.  The administration has found 23 batches of tainted products
from nine capsule makers including  Tonghua Golden-Horse
Pharmaceutical Industry Co. (000766) , the SFDA said today in a statement.  The government ordered the companies to recall and destroy
the affected batches of capsules. The producers must stop all
drug-capsule output and sales until they are authorized to
resume after inspections, according to the statement.  China’s police have detained 53 suspects and closed 10
industrial gelatin and gel capsule manufacturing plants that may
be involved in the scandal, Xinhua News Agency reported today,
citing the Ministry of Public Security.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
