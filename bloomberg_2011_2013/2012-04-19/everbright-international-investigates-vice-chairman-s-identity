(Corrects headline and first paragraph to remove reference
to investigation for story published April 19.)  China Everbright International Ltd. (257) 
said it’s verifying the identity of Vice Chairman Li Xueming,
after  Apple Daily  reported he’s the brother of ousted Chongqing
party secretary  Bo Xilai .  The company will probably complete the checks after a week,
spokeswoman Olivia Wang said today, citing comments made by
Chief Executive Chen Xiaoping yesterday in Hong Kong. She
declined to elaborate. Apple Daily said Li is also known as Bo
Xiyong, the elder brother of Bo Xilai.  Attention to the corporate interests of Bo’s family
intensified after he was suspended from top positions in the
government and the Communist Party in the past month. Bo’s wife,
Gu Kailai, and an aide were put in custody on suspicion of
murdering British businessman Neil Heywood, the official Xinhua
News Agency said this month.  Li was appointed as vice chairman and  executive director  in
2003 by China Everbright’s parent, the Hong Kong-listed
renewable energy company said in an emailed statement today.  Li graduated from Beijing’s Tsinghua University and was a
vice president at  China Aerospace International Holdings Ltd. (31) 
before joining the company, China Everbright said. He holds no
shares, receives no bonus and isn’t involved in China
Everbright’s daily operation, according to the statement. He has
an annual salary of HK$1.7 million ($219,000) for 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Shares of China Everbright rose 1.2 percent to close at
HK$3.33 in Hong Kong today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
