The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission accused OptionsXpress Inc., its former chief
financial officer Thomas E. Stern and an affiliated dealer of
violating registration requirements in order to avoid an audit.  The  action  filed today in administrative court in
 Washington  is the second against OptionsXpress and Stern this
week. They were named in an April 16 enforcement case accusing
them of engaging in a scheme to allow illegal short sales.  OX Trading LLC operated as an unregistered dealer from
October 2009 to November 2010 and illegally traded securities
while not being a member of a national securities association or
national exchange, the SEC said. Stern, who was also Ox
Trading’s chief compliance officer, fabricated and backdated a
letter to demonstrate that he had properly informed regulators
that OX Trading would de-register and become a customer of
optionsXpress, according to the order.  “OptionsXpress, OX Trading, and Stern have displayed a
profound disregard for regulators, compliance obligations, and
the regulatory requirements that dealers must satisfy for the
privilege of operating in our markets,” Daniel Hawke, head of
the SEC’s market abuse unit, said in a statement. “Registration
of brokers and dealers is a fundamental part of the regulatory
structure and provides the foundation upon which other investor
protections are built.”  A phone call to Vincent Schmeltz, Stern’s attorney, wasn’t
immediately returned. Stephen Senderowitz, a lawyer for OX
Trading and OptionsXpress, declined immediate comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
