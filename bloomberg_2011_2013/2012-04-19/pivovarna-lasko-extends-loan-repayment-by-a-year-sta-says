Pivovarna Lasko (PILR)  Group d.d. agreed
with banks in Slovenia to delay about 160 million euro ($210
million) of loan repayments, STA newswire reported, citing
people close to the Slovenian drinks company it didnâ€™t name.  The loans from Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., Nova Kreditna
Banka Maribor d.d. and others were due at the end of March and
were extended for one year or more with some of the lenders, the
Slovenian newswire said.  Pivovarna Lasko spokesman Jure Struc declined to confirm
the agreement in a phone interview today and said the company
may give details at a press conference in Ljubljana tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
