Norway  central bank Governor
Oeystein Olsen said the economic outlook is better than it was
some months ago.  “We note the bright spots that have appeared” in the
global economy, Olsen said today in a speech in Oslo.  Though markets continue to be plagued by “great
uncertainty,” the krone has “been stable” in recent weeks, he
said. The krone is an important channel for the economy and is
“very important” for the inflation outlook, he said.  The governor reiterated his view that the bank won’t need
to resort to a Swiss-style currency cap to curb the krone’s
gains.  “We haven’t discussed it,” he said. “We’re not even
close to the same situation Switzerland was in.”  The  Swiss National Bank  imposed a cap on the franc in
September, sending risk-averse investors to alternative  currency
markets  such as Norway’s krone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
