Iran  plans to increase crude
production to 5.1 million barrels a day “in the coming years,”
according to the oil ministry’s website.  The country is scheduled to export 3.36 million barrels a
day by 2015, it said, citing Ahmad Qalebani, managing director
of the National Iranian Oil Co. Its output averaged 3.63 million
barrels a day in 2011, Bloomberg estimates show.  Iran plans to sign contracts for the development of oil and
gas fields that straddle the country’s border with neighboring
states by March 2013, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
