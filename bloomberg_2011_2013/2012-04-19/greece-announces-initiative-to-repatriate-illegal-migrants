Greece ’s Citizen Protection
Ministry announced a 10 million-euro ($13 million) initiative to
help repatriate illegal immigrants to their home countries.  Non-government groups will be able to submit proposals for
the voluntarily return of migrants, according to a statement on
the ministry’s  website.   The announcement comes amid a clampdown on illegal
immigration ahead of May 6 elections. Last month, Citizen
Protection Minister Michalis Chrisochoides unveiled a plan to
establish 30 detention centers to hold migrants, and police
conducted sweeps of central Athens, rounding up hundreds of
migrants.  As many as 90 percent of illegal immigrants in the European
Union entered through Greece in 2011, according to Greek police
statistics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
