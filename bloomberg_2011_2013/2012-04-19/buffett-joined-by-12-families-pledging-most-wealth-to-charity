Twelve families promised to donate
most of their wealth to philanthropy, joining the Giving Pledge
initiative started by  Warren Buffett  and Bill and Melinda Gates.  The families include hedge-fund manager  Bill Ackman  and his
wife Karen,  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) ’s billionaire owner Elon Musk and
film producer Steve Bing, according to an e-mailed statement
from the initiative.  Arthur M. Blank, Edgar M. Bronfman, Glenn and Eva Dubin,
Red and Charline McCombs, Michael Moritz and Harriet Heyman,
John and Ginger Sall, Henry and Susan Samueli, John A. and Susan
Sobrato, John Michael Sobrato, and Ted and Vada Stanley also
signed the pledge.  “They come from different backgrounds, but share a common
desire to see positive change in our world,” Buffett said in
the statement. “We’ve said from the beginning that this is a
long-term effort, but I’m particularly pleased to see continued
momentum in encouraging greater and more thoughtful
philanthropy.”  Buffett, 81, is the third-richest man in the world,
according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking
of the wealthiest people on Earth. He has a net worth of $44.6
billion. Gates, 56, ranks second with a $62.7 billion fortune.  To contact the reporter on this story:
