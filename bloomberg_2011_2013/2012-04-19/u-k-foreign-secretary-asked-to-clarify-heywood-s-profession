U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  was asked by lawmakers to provide more information about
the relationship between Neil Heywood, the British businessman
who was killed in  China , and the government.  Richard Ottaway, the chairman of the Parliament’s Foreign
Affairs Committee, asked Hague in a letter today if Heywood
supplied “the British Consulate or Embassy with information,
either on a formal or informal basis?”  The U.K. has asked China to investigate the circumstances
of the death, after originally being told Heywood died from
alcohol poisoning. Heywood’s death has touched off the biggest
political upheaval in China since the 1989 Tiananmen Square
student protests and comes ahead of a once-a-decade Communist
Party leadership transition later this year.  The Foreign & Commonwealth office said in a statement today
that Heywood wasn’t an employee of the British government. Last
week the FCO said in an e-mail that it wasn’t aware of Heywood’s
business interests in China and that it had never dealt with
him.  Heywood, 41, died in Chongqing on Nov. 14. Chinese
authorities said April 10 that Gu Kailai, the wife of former
Chongqing Communist Party Secretary  Bo Xilai , is suspected of
murdering Heywood. Gu, along with her son, Bo Guagua, had a
“conflict over economic interests” with Heywood, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported the same day.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  this week called on China to
ensure that its probe into the death of Heywood uncovers the
truth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
