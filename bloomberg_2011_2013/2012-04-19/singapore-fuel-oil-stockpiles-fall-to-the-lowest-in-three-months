Singapore stockpiles of  fuel oil 
fell to the lowest level in three months, according to data from
a unit of the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
dropped 21 percent to 16.39 million barrels in the week ended
April 18,  International Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Supplies are at the lowest level since Jan. 18.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline, fell 0.6 percent to 10.72 million barrels. Middle
distillates, a category that includes gasoil and kerosene,
dropped 1.6 percent to 10.82 million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
