E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , a
Hungarian renewable energy and heating company, fell to the
lowest in almost three years after starting a “restructuring
plan” to address accounting errors and boost liquidity.  The shares fell as much as 3.2 percent and traded 1.1
percent lower at 2,400 forint by 9:43 a.m. in Budapest, the
lowest intraday level since May 2009.  E-Star cannot present audited financial statements to
shareholders today after discovering “imperfections” in its
2011 accounts, the company said in a  statement  to the Budapest
Stock Exchange today. E-Star needs to recalculate some projects
and will start the “restructuring” to elimininate the
accounting problems and “enforce the liquidity situation of the
company.”  “We expect negative market reaction as investors focus on
financial problems,” Peter Szentirmai, a Budapest-based analyst
at the broker unit of  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , wrote in a research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
