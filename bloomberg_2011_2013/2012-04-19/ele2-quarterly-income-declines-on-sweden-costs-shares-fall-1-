Tele2 AB (TEL2B) , Sweden’s second-largest
wireless provider, reported first-quarter earnings that missed
estimates as the company spent more to retain customers in
Sweden and Russia. The stock fell as much as 6.7 percent.  Net income declined 28 percent to 869 million kronor ($129
million), Stockholm-based Tele2 said in a statement. Analysts
expected 1.09 billion kronor according to the average of 12
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue gained 9 percent to
10.5 billion kronor in line with estimates.  Tele2, which made its name as a prepaid provider, is trying
to shift more customers to postpaid and data subscriptions while
maintaining low prices. Earnings in Sweden were pared by
marketing costs for postpaid offers as competitors stepped up
competition, Tele2 said. The company also spent more on gaining
customers in  Russia , where the margin for earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization contracted to 35
percent. The company’s number of total subscribers gained 11
percent to 34.7 million, including 20.9 million in Russia.  “The message is that they’re prepared to sacrifice margins
for faster top line growth,” said Andrew Hogley, a London-based
analyst at Espirito Santo Investment Bank. “People were more
concerned about the margin than excited about the faster
growth.”  Shares Decline  Tele2  declined  as much as 6.7 percent to 122.20 kronor, the
biggest intraday decline in four months, and was trading down
5.3 percent at 123.90 kronor as of 11:00 a.m. in the Swedish
capital.  The company reduced its full-year forecast for the margin
of Swedish earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and
amortization by three percentage points to 30 to 32 percent of
sales. Tele2 raised its forecast for full-year mobile revenue in
 Sweden  to 3 percent to 5 percent.  “Come what may, we’re going to defend the price points,”
Chief Executive Officer Mats Granryd said in an interview. The
company introduced a 10-gigabyte data package in Sweden with
unlimited texting for 345 kronor to counter an offer from 3
Scandinavia, he said.  Tele2 last month demonstrated the technical feasibility of
providing so-called fourth-generation mobile broadband service
in Russia, its biggest market by subscribers, on its existing
bandwidth. The company expects authorities to decide this year
on whether to allow the spectrum reuse.  To contact the reporter on this story:
