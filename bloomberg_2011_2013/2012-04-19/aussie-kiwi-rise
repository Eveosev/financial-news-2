The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars pared gains as Asian stocks fell before  Spain  sells debt
today amid concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  New Zealand’s dollar traded 0.3 percent from a one-week low
after data showed consumer prices increased in the first
quarter by less than the central bank forecast, giving Governor
Alan Bollard scope to hold  interest rates  at a record low. The
nation’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to receive
floating rates, touched 2.895 percent, the least since Feb. 16.
The South Pacific currencies gained as much as 0.3 percent
earlier on speculation China will take further steps to support
its economy.  “Concerns over European debt crisis may flare up again if
the Spanish bond auctions go badly today,” said Toshiya Yamauchi, a senior analyst in  Tokyo  at Ueda Harlow Ltd., which
provides margin-trading services. “Currencies sensitive to
stock moves such as the Aussie would be sold off in the face of
rising risk aversion.”  The so-called Aussie dollar earlier reached $1.0388 before
trading little changed from yesterday at $1.0360 as of 3:23 p.m.
in Sydney. It rose 0.2 percent to 84.33 yen.  New Zealand’s dollar bought 81.67 U.S. cents from 81.59
yesterday, when it touched 81.46 cents, the weakest level since
April 11. The kiwi added 0.3 percent to 66.47 yen.  Spain Auctions  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks declined as much as
0.4 percent following a 0.3 percent slide in the MSCI’s World
Index yesterday.  Spain is scheduled to sell up to 2.5 billion euros ($3.28
billion) of bonds maturing in 2014 and 2022 today after data
yesterday showed non-performing loans as a proportion of total
lending jumped to the highest level since 1994.  New Zealand’s consumer prices climbed 0.5 percent from the
fourth quarter, when they declined 0.3 percent, the government
said in Wellington today. The result matched the median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey. Prices increased 1.6 percent in the
year ended March 31, the slowest annual pace since September
2010.  “With consumer prices at these levels, it’s unlikely the
 Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will increase interest rates any
time soon,” said Ueda Harrow’s Yamauchi.  Consumer Prices  A  Credit Suisse Group AG index  based on swaps indicates the
RBNZ will raise interest rates by 12 basis points, or 0.12
percentage point, over the next 12 months, compared with 36
basis points of increases indicated on March 21.  Australia ’s government bonds  advanced , sending the yield on
the 10-year security down six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 3.81 percent. Yields on the three-year government note
fell three basis points to 3.23 percent.  China will boost liquidity by cutting the reserve
requirement ratio if necessary, Xinhua News Agency said, citing
an unidentified People’s Bank of  China  official. China may also
increase open market operations including reverse  repurchase
agreements , redemption of central bank bills, according to the
report. China is Australia’s biggest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export market.  “We believe that an RRR cut will come soon,” Darius Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Credit Agricole CIB,
wrote in a note clients today. Media reports about the Chinese
central bank add “to speculation of an imminent reduction of
the RRR, which should be positive for sentiment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
