Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY)  said its
experimental hepatitis C compounds, protease inhibitor
asunaprevir combined with its NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir,
cured 77 percent of difficult-to-treat patients 24 weeks after
treatment ended, according to a mid-stage study.  Difficult-to-treat patients included those who didn’t
respond to prior therapy and patients who were medically
ineligible or intolerant to previous treatment, the company said
in a statement today.  In a separate mid-stage study, Bristol-Myers’ experimental
peginterferon lambda drug had a cure rate similar to
peginterferon alfa with fewer side effects, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
