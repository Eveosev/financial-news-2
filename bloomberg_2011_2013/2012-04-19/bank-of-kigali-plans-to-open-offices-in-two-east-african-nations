Bank of Kigali Ltd. ,  Rwanda ’s
biggest lender by assets, will open offices in two East African
nations before the end of the year as it seeks to expand outside
its home market, Chief Executive Officer James Gatera said.  The bank, based in the Rwandan capital, Kigali, has
received approval from the central bank to open the outlets,
Gatera said in a phone interview today from the city. He
declined to identify the two countries.  “We have applied with corresponding central banks and if we
get a no-objection confirmation, we will be able to disclose the
countries,” he said.  Bank of Kigali posted a 41 percent increase in full-year
profit to 8.7 billion francs ($14.3 million) last year as net
interest income, the money banks earn from interest charges on
loans, jumped 36 percent to 16.6 billion francs.  The bank has 46 branches in Rwanda and offers retail and
commercial-banking services to more 100,000 individuals and at
least 13,000 legal entities. Total assets grew 47 percent to
291.3 billion francs last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
