Spain  sold 2.54 billion euros of
two-year and 10-year bonds, compared with a maximum target of
2.5 billion euros.  The Treasury sold its 10-year benchmark bond at an average
yield of 5.743 percent, compared with 5.789 percent on the
secondary market before the auction, and 5.403 percent when it
last sold them in January. It sold two-year securities at 3.463
percent.  Demand for the 10-year debt was 2.42 times the amount sold,
compared with 2.17 at the Jan. 19 sale, and the bid-to-cover for
the bonds maturing in October 2014 was 3.28.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
