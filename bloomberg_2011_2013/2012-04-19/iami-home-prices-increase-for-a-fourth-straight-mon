Home prices  in the Miami area rose
for a fourth straight month in March as fewer condominiums and
houses came to market and  distressed properties  accounted for a
smaller share of deals.  Condo prices in Miami-Dade County jumped 46 percent from a
year earlier to a median $141,700, the Miami Association of
Realtors said yesterday in a statement. Single-family home
prices gained 13 percent to $180,000.  Values are recovering after  Florida ’s unemployment rate
fell by more than one percentage point in the past year,
according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Property listings
in the Miami area declined 34 percent in March from a year
earlier, pushing up prices as demand increased. Distressed real
estate accounted for 49 percent of sales, down from 52 percent,
according to the Realtors group.  “The inventory has dropped dramatically, and many buyers
realize this may be the bottom,” Peter Zalewski, principal at
Bal Harbour, Florida-based  Condo Vultures LLC , said in a
telephone interview yesterday. “Most of the smart money got in
around 2009 and 2010, and are now re-trading at a premium.”  All-cash buyers made up 65 percent of Miami-Dade sales last
month, down from 66 percent in March 2011. Almost 90 percent of
international buyers in Miami pay with cash, according to the
association.  “We expect this trend to continue, as Miami increasingly
attracts international buyers and investors, second and vacation
home buyers, and migrating U.S. residents,” Martha Pomares, the
trade group’s chairman, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
