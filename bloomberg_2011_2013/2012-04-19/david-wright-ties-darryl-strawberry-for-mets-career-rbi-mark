David Wright  drove in three runs to
tie Darryl Strawberry for the Mets’ career mark with 733 runs
batted in as New York lost 14-6 at Atlanta.  Wright, who is playing with a broken little finger on his
right hand, had a two-run double in the third inning yesterday
and then tied the franchise mark with an RBI infield single in
the fifth.  Wright, 29, is in his ninth year with the Mets. Strawberry
spent his first eight seasons with the Mets in a career that
also included stints with the  Los Angeles Dodgers , San Francisco
Giants and New York Yankees.  “It’s an honor,” Wright told reporters. “Straw was a
great, great player.”  Wright ranks fourth on the franchise list in home runs with
185, trailing Strawberry (252), Mike Piazza (220) and Howard Johnson (192).  To contact the reporter on this story:
