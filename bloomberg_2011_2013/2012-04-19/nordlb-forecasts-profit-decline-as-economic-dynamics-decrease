Norddeutsche Landesbank
Girozentrale, the world’s fifth-largest shipping lender, said
profit will probably decline this year after the bank reported a
71 percent jump in 2011 on lower loan losses.  Net income increased to 536 million euros ($704 million)
last year compared with 314 million euros in 2010, the Hanover,
Germany-based company said in a  statement  today.  NordLB, which managed to steer through the global financial
crisis in 2008 and 2009 without a bailout, expects loan-loss
provisions to rise “significantly” this year because of
“decreasing economic dynamics,” it said. In response, the bank
plans to “stabilize” annual expenses at 1.1 billion euros in
coming years to improve its ability to accumulate cash.  “It is apparent that the current year will be much more
difficult,” NordLB said. “Higher risk costs are to be expected
because of the economic development.”  Still, there was an “operationally good” start to 2012
with net interest and provision income developing “slightly
above” 2011 levels, while the risk situation “remained
relaxed,” NordLB said. Last year, loan-loss provisions dropped
68 percent to 205 million euros, the company reported.  NordLB is the world’s No. 5 shipping lender with a market
share of 4.4 percent among the world’s 40 largest shipping
banks, according to Athens-based vessel-finance consultant
Petrofin SA. The ranking is topped by  HSH Nordbank ,  Norway ’s  DNB
ASA (DNB) , Frankfurt-based Commerzbank AG and  Sweden ’s Nordea AB.  NordLB had a shipping portfolio of  19.5 billion euros  at
the end of last year, of which 34 percent was lending to
container shipping. Pretax profit at the unit rose 14 percent to
154.6 million euros last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
