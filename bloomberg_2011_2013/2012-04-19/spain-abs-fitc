Repossessed properties in Spain are
worth 48 percent less on average than the value assigned when
their mortgages were originated, according to  Fitch Ratings .  Declines range from 37 percent to 57 percent, analysts Juan David Garcia and Carlos Masip in Madrid wrote in a report
analyzing 11,000 repossessed homes bought with loans from banks
including  Banco Santander SA (SAN)  and  Bankia SA. (BKIA)  The mortgages are in
asset-backed securities with high loan-to-value ratios,
typically of more than 80 percent.  “Fitch expects property prices to continue falling, due to
the recessionary environment and severe dislocation of the
Spanish  property market ,” Garcia wrote. “The speed of
additional correction in prices will largely be driven by
financial institutions’ foreclosure management strategies.”  Only 31 percent of repossessed properties have been sold as
a result of the poorly performing economy and the reluctance of
financial institutions to manage “forced” property sales,
Fitch said. Stricter rules introduced in February will create
incentives for banks to dispose of assets more quickly, the
ratings company added.  Spanish home prices fell by the most on record in the
fourth quarter as the euro area’s fourth-largest economy shrank
and a reduction in mortgage lending crimped property demand.  The average price of houses and apartments declined 11.2
percent from a year earlier, the most since the measurement
began in 2008. Prices dropped 4.2 percent from the previous
quarter and are down 21.7 percent from the market’s peak in the
third quarter of 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
