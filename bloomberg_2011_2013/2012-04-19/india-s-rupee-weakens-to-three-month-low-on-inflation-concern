India ’s rupee dropped to the
weakest level in more than three months on concern inflation
will accelerate, damping demand for the nation’s assets.  The consumer-price index climbed 9.47 percent in March from
a year earlier, official data showed yesterday, compared with an
8.83 percent advance in February.  Reserve Bank  of India Governor
 Duvvuri Subbarao  reiterated that room for interest-rate
reductions is “limited” and would depend on the inflation
trend.  “The statement from the governor has shown his concern
that there is every possibility the inflation rate will rise,”
said Ravi Ranjit, chief manager at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“Inflows are at risk and there is definite pressure on the
rupee.”  The Indian currency declined 0.3 percent to 51.91 per
dollar as of 9:49 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 51.95 earlier, the weakest level since Jan.
10. The currency may today drop past the psychological barrier
of 52, Ranjit said, adding the central bank might sell dollars
to prevent a fall beyond 52.20 or 52.30 as this would inflate
the import bill.  One-month implied volatility for the rupee, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, rose 34 basis points,
or 0.34 percentage point, to 9.94 percent.  The benchmark  wholesale-price index  rose 6.89 percent in
March from a year earlier, exceeding the median 6.65 percent
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. While inflation has eased
from a rate of more than 9 percent in the 12 months through
November, it’s the fastest in the so-called BRIC group of
emerging-market economies that also includes Brazil, Russia and
 China .  Six-month onshore forwards traded at 53.65 per dollar,
compared with 53.44 yesterday, and offshore non-deliverable
contracts were at 53.69 from 53.50. Forwards are agreements to
buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable
contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
