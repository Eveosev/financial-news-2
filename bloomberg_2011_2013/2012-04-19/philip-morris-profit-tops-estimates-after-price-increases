Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) ,
the world’s largest publicly traded tobacco company, reported
first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates, helped by an
increase in pricing.  Net income rose 13 percent to $2.16 billion, or $1.25 a
share, from $1.92 billion, or $1.06, a year earlier, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. Analysts projected
$1.19, the average of 16  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer Louis Camilleri boosted shipments
of the company’s 10 biggest cigarette brands, including
Marlboro, while price increases added $369 million to sales. The
company increased sales in Asia, making up for the impact of
strength in the U.S. dollar that hurt sales generated abroad.  “The volume gains were great, with strength across most
brands and most regions,”  Jack Russo , an analyst at Edward
Jones & Co., said today in an e-mail. “The core underlying
business remains real strong,” said Russo, who recommends
buying the shares.  Philip Morris  reduced its full-year earnings forecast
because of the stronger  U.S. dollar . Profit will be $5.20 to
$5.30 share, down from a February projection of $5.25 to $5.35.  Excluding excise taxes, total sales in the first quarter
rose 9.7 percent to $7.4 billion, beating the $7.22 billion
average of analysts’ estimates.  Philip Morris, which generates all its revenue outside the
U.S., fell 1.1 percent to $86.75 at the close in  New York . The
shares have gained 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
