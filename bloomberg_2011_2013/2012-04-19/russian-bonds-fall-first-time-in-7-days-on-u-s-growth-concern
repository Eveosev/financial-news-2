Russia’s Eurobonds fell and the
ruble weakened after a report showed more Americans than
forecast filed applications for  unemployment benefits  last week,
a sign of weakening growth in the world’s largest economy.  The $2 billion of bonds due April 2017 declined for the
first time in seven days, pushing the yield up two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.994 percent. The Russian currency
depreciated as much as 0.4 percent before trading little changed
at 29.535 per dollar.  Jobless claims fell by 2,000 to 386,000 last week from a
revised 388,000 in the prior period that was higher than
initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median forecast of 47 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a drop to 370,000.  The ruble weakened 0.2 percent to 38.81 per euro and was
steady at 33.7088 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket. Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at 29.933 per
dollar in three months, compared with 29.8951 per dollar
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
