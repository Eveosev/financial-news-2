Azerbaijan  had its sovereign debt
rating raised to investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service,
which cited an improvement in the Caspian nation’s public
finances and efforts to reduce dependence on the oil industry.  The rating was raised one step to Baa3 from Ba1 and was
given a stable outlook, Moody’s said today in a statement. That
puts Azerbaijan at the same level as Latvia, Iceland, Romania
and Croatia.  “High  oil prices  have helped the government accumulate
considerable foreign assets” in both the State Oil Fund and
central bank reserves, Moody’s said. “High  government spending 
on upgrading Azerbaijan’s infrastructure and developing new
industries helped non-oil sector output expand by 9.4 percent
last year, up from 7.9 percent in 2010.”  Azerbaijan’s economy expanded 0.5 percent from a year
earlier in the first quarter, President  Ilham Aliyev  said April
16, the Azartac news service reported. Excluding the oil
industry, gross domestic product rose 7.7 percent, state-run
Azartac said.  In the first two months of the year non-energy industries
generated 43 percent of GDP, the statistics office data show.  Rising government revenue should support the further
diversification of the economy, Moody’s said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
