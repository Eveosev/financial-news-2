China  Mobile Ltd., the world’s
largest phone company by users, plans to begin fourth-generation
wireless service in  Hong Kong  this month to win customers from
rivals including  Telstra Corp. (TLS)  and  PCCW Ltd. (8)   The Chinese company will offer more than one 4G handset
when it rolls out the service on April 25, Sean Lee, chief
executive officer of China Mobile Hong Kong Co., said at a
briefing today, without elaborating. A total of 10 4G phones
will become available for customers this year, he said.  China Mobile will become the second operator to offer 4G in
Hong Kong after Telstra Corp.’s CSL Ltd. in 2010. The fourth-
generation service lets users download games and videos on their
phones at the fastest speeds available as operators compete for
users in a city where the number of mobile customers is twice
the population.  Discounts for handsets will be offered to 4G subscribers,
Lee said. China Mobile’s 4G plans will be priced “close” to
slower 3G services, he said, without providing numbers.  The high-speed service, based on LTE technology, offers
maximum download speeds of 100 megabits a second, or as much as
50 times quicker than 3G, China Mobile said.  Shares of China Mobile fell 0.4 percent to HK$86.15 at the
close of Hong Kong trading. The city’s  Hang Seng Index  rose 1
percent.  The Hong Kong unit successfully bid in February for its
second spectrum band to offer 4G Long-Term Evolution service,
after acquiring frequency in 2009.  Billionaire Li Ka-shing’s  Hutchison Telecommunications Hong
Kong Holdings Ltd. (215)  and his son’s PCCW also plan to start 4G
services later this year.  China Mobile accounts for more than 20 percent of Hong
Kong’s wireless market, Tiger Lin, chairman of the Hong Kong
unit, said today, declining to specify the number of users.  The latest bid gave China Mobile the 2330-megahertz to
2360-megahertz time division duplex, or TDD, spectrum, adding to
the 2600-megahertz frequency division duplex, or FDD, spectrum
obtained in 2009.  FDD and TDD are the two primary methods of delivering 4G
LTE wireless service.  China Mobile’s state-owned parent is rolling out a trial
network for 4G service in other parts of China that’s based on
the TDD mode.  The TD-LTE 4G trial will be expanded to nine cities in
China from six last year,  China Mobile Ltd. (941)  said last month. The
company will test 20,000 4G base stations this year, taking the
total number in the China trial to more than 200,000 in 2013, it
said.  Hong Kong had  15.1 million  mobile-phone customers as of
January, according to the city’s Office of the Communications
Authority. Its population stood at 7.1 million at the end of
last year.  China Mobile acquired Peoples Telephone Co. to expand in
Hong Kong in 2006. The unit was renamed China Mobile Hong Kong
Co. in 2008.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
