(Corrects headline and first paragraph after company
clarified that its comment related to Codelco stake option, not
profit freeze.)  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  said Codelco’s
option to increase its stake in Anglo’s Sur unit is “not a
normal one.”  “Codelco’s executives appear to be in denial about what is
set out explicitly in the legal contract, particularly in
relation to timing and the mechanism for calculating the number
of shares,” Anglo spokesman James Wyatt-Tilby said in an e-
mailed response to a query today.  Wyatt-Tilby declined to comment on remarks by Codelco Chief
Executive Officer  Diego Hernandez  yesterday that the company is
considering seeking a court order to freeze profit earned by Sur
until a ruling on their dispute with Anglo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
