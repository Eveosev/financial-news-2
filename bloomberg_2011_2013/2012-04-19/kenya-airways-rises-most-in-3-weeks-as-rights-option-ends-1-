Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest carrier, rose the most in more than three
weeks as the shares traded for the first day without a premium
attached to a rights offer.  The stock climbed 3.6 percent, the most since March 26, to
close in Nairobi at 14.5 shillings, the highest price since
March 20.  Kenya Airways is seeking to raise $250 million in a rights
offer, with the airline offering 1.48 billion shares at a ratio
of 16 for every five held. Until yesterday’s deadline for the
offer, non-shareholders paid the market price for the shares
plus a 5 cents premium, according to an official at the carrier.
From today only the market price applies, which makes the shares
at least 5 cents cheaper, he said.  “It is a psychological ceiling that has now been
removed,” George Bodo, an equity strategist at Nairobi-based
Apex  Africa  Capital Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
