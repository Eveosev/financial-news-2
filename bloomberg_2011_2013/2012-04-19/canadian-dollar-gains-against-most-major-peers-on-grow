Canada ’s dollar dropped against the
greenback for a second day as jobless-benefit claims rose in the
U.S., the nation’s biggest trading partner, damping demand for
assets tied to growth.  The loonie, as Canada’s currency is known, fell as stocks
and oil, Canada’s largest export, slumped. The Canadian dollar
is up 0.4 percent versus the greenback this week after Bank of
Canada Governor  Mark Carney  signaled removing stimulus was an
“appropriate” measure to contain consumer debt levels.  “The data that we’re seeing out of the U.S. offered more
evidence that the recovery shifted into a lower gear, so that
doesn’t bode well for Canada,” said  Joe Manimbo , a market
analyst in Washington at Western Union Business Solutions, a
unit of  Western Union Co. (WU)  “The loonie’s downside appears to be
protected by the growing view that the BOC is likely to raise
rates ahead of previous forecasts.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, declined 0.5
percent to 99.57 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5:02 p.m. in Toronto.
It reached 98.65 cents on April 17, the strongest since March
20. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0043.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.6 percent while
crude oil futures fell 0.1 percent to $102.60 a barrel in  New
York .  Bonds Gain  Ten-year  government bonds  were little changed, yielding
2.04 percent. The 3.25 percent securities maturing in June 2021
fell four cents to C$109.98.  Federal bonds have lost 0.5 percent this year, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch data.  Odds of an increase in the central bank’s target lending
rate by the October meeting were about 59 percent today,
according to Bloomberg calculations on overnight index swaps.
They were about 27 percent on April 5.  “The market remains skittish,” said Firas Askari, head
currency trader at  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  in Toronto, in an e-mail.
“There’s been a U.S. dollar bounce across the board.”  The Canadian dollar advanced 0.8 percent during the past
three months among 10 currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Indexes. That compared with a 2.7 percent
drop in the Australian dollar and a 7.3 percent decline in the
yen.  Canada Views  “Canada looks much stronger on both a relative basis in
terms of growth and just on a balance-sheet basis,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of research at the online currency trader
GFT Forex, by phone from New York. “It looks attractive because
the Bank of Canada seemed to signal a little bit more of a
hawkish posture. A huge part of how Canada trades is going to be
dependent on the  U.S. economy  over the next couple of months.”  U.S. jobless claims fell by 2,000 to 386,000 in the week
ended April 14 from a revised 388,000 the prior period that was
higher than initially estimated, Labor Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median forecast of 47 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a drop to 370,000.  Canada’s consumer price index rose at an annualized 2
percent pace in March, according to the median forecast of 25
forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  Statistics Canada  releases the
data, along with leading indicators, forecast to advance 0.5
percent in March, at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow in Ottawa.  The loonie will appreciate to 98 cents by the end of 2012,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  To contact the reporters on this story:
