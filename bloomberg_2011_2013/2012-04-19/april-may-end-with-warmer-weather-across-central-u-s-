April may end with warmer weather
building across the central U.S. from  Wyoming  to Ohio, according
to forecasters.  Temperatures are expected to be 6 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit
(3.3 to 5.6 Celsius) above normal through most of the area from
April 25 to April 29, and possibly higher in  South Dakota , said
David Salmon of Weather Derivatives in Belton, Missouri.
Predictions diverge as May begins.  Commodities traders watch temperature outlooks to gauge
energy use and demand. About 51 percent of U.S. households use
gas for heating, according to the Energy Department, while
demand from electricity generators peaks in the summer months to
meet air conditioning needs.  Warm air will probably hang over the central U.S.,
spreading into the mid-Atlantic and South, from April 29 to May
3, according to  Matt Rogers , president of Commodity Weather
Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  MDA EarthSat Weather predicts the farm states of  North
Dakota , South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa will cool to
more seasonal temperatures in that same time frame. MDA expects
the warmth to be concentrated on the Ohio Valley and South.  The normal average temperature for April 28 in New York is
about 57, according to MDA in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Itâ€™s 53 in
Boston, 54 in Chicago, 62 in  St. Louis , 66 in Atlanta, 72 in
Dallas, 74 in Houston, 53 in Seattle and 64 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
