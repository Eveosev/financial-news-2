The euro touched its strongest
level in two weeks versus the dollar after German business
confidence unexpectedly increased to a nine-month high, fueling
investor appetite for risk.  The 17-nation currency strengthened versus the yen amid
bets the  International Monetary Fund  will increase its lending
capacity to help keep  Europe ’s debt crisis contained. The pound
gained for a fifth day against the dollar after U.K. retail
sales climbed. Canada’s dollar advanced after consumer prices
rose, fueling bets the central bank will move forward its
timetable for raising  interest rates .  “This is a broader sentiment recovery, and the euro is
being driven by better-than-expected Ifo readings,” said Ned Rumpeltin, head of Group of 10 currency strategy at Standard
Chartered Plc in London, referring to the German confidence
gauge. “U.K. retail sales were also quite constructive.”  The euro gained 0.6 percent to $1.3215 at 1:50 p.m. New
York time, headed for a 1 percent weekly advance, the first
since March 30. It touched $1.3225, the highest level since
April 4. The shared currency rose 0.6 percent to 107.82 yen,
poised for a 1.9 percent five-day increase, its first weekly
jump since March 30. The yen was little changed at 81.57 per
dollar, set for a 0.8 percent weekly drop.  The Munich-based  Ifo institute  said today its business
climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, rose to
109.9 this month from 109.8 in March. Economists in a Bloomberg
survey forecast a drop to 109.5.  ‘Deep Pockets’  “There is also optimism going into the IMF meeting this
weekend, and there’s a good chance  Christine Lagarde  will
achieve her $400 billion target,” said  Kathy Lien , director of
currency research at the online currency trader GFT Forex in  New
York . “The U.S. and Canada weren’t planning on contributing,
but  China  may contribute and  Russia  is thinking about it, so
there are countries that still have deep pockets.”  IMF Managing Director Lagarde told reporters this week
before the lender’s meeting she expected the IMF’s firepower to
be “significantly” increased.  The $400 billion sum is contained in the draft of a
statement obtained by Bloomberg News that will be released by
Group of 20 nations finance ministers and central bankers after
a meeting now under way in  Washington .  The near-doubling of the fund’s lending capacity is being
coupled with warnings that it doesn’t absolve Europe of the need
to intensify its own efforts to end the crisis.  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trade partners, fell 0.5 percent to 79.187 as U.S. stocks
snapped a two-day decline amid better-than-estimated earnings
reports from Microsoft Corp. and General Electric Co. The
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.7 percent.  Brazil’s Real  Brazil ’s real rose versus most major counterparts, snapping
five days of losses as risk appetite rose. The central bank
lowered the benchmark rate this week by three-quarters of a
percentage point to 9 percent and signaled more cuts may come.  The real gained 0.8 percent to 1.8663 per dollar after
touching 1.8935 yesterday, the weakest level since November.
Mexico’s peso also rallied today, appreciating 0.7 percent to
13.1011 to the greenback, and South Africa’s rand gained 0.6
percent to 7.8093 per dollar.  Canada ’s dollar, nicknamed the loonie for the image of the
aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, advanced 0.4 percent to 99.16
cents to the greenback. The nation’s consumer prices advanced
1.9 percent in March from a year earlier, after a 2.6 percent
increase in February,  Statistics Canada  said today in Ottawa.  Rate-Boost Odds  Odds of an increase by October in the Bank of Canada’s
target lending  rate  were about 64 percent today after the
inflation data, according to Bloomberg calculations on overnight
index swaps. They were about 19 percent on April 16, the day
before the central bank suggested higher borrowing costs may be
necessary to contain consumer debt levels.  The yen touched its weakest level since April 10 versus the
dollar, 81.78, on speculation the  Bank of Japan (8301)  will add to
monetary easing at its next meeting on April 27. Bank Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa said in a speech in Washington this week the
nation still needs monetary stimulus.  The BOJ set a 1 percent inflation goal on Feb. 14 and
increased the size of its program to buy government debt. Deputy
Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura said two days ago the central bank
is ready to implement additional easing if necessary.  ‘Political Pressure’  “Political pressure on the BOJ has increased, and that’s
why we’re looking for a higher dollar-yen,”  Mary Nicola , a
currency strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, said in a
Bloomberg Radio interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom
Keene . BNP expects  Japan ’s currency to weaken to 85 by mid-year.  The yen fell against most of its major counterparts today.
It has tumbled 8.7 percent this year, the worst performer among
the 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes . The dollar has lost 2.6 percent,
and the euro has fallen 0.4 percent.  Sterling was poised for its biggest weekly gain versus the
dollar in 11 months after U.K. retail sales climbed more than
forecast in March.  Sales including auto fuel gained 1.8 percent, compared with
February, when they declined 0.8 percent, the Office for
National Statistics said today in  London .  The pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.6117, headed for a 1.7
percent gain since April 13, the most since May 2011. Its five-
day winning streak was the longest in three months. The U.K.
currency added 0.2 percent to 81.98 pence per euro after
touching 81.62 pence yesterday, the strongest level since Aug.
26, 2010.  To contact the reporters on this story:
