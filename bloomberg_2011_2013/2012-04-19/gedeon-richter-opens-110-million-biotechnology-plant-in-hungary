Gedeon Richter Nyrt. (RICHT) ,  Hungary ’s
largest drugmaker, opened a biotechnology plant today, built at
a cost of 25 billion forint ($110 million).  The new factory will make protein samples for clinical
tests using mammal cells and start producing drugs for treating
cancer and inflammation in 2014, Erik Bogsch, Richter’s chief
executive officer, said at the opening ceremony. Richter
received 1.4 billion forint in government subsidies for building
the plant.  Richter, a generic-drug specialist, wants to break into the
global market for biopharmaceuticals -- medicines created by
manipulating cells and genes. The company has spent 214 billion
forint in the past 10 years and is the only Hungarian business
to own a Europe-wide sales network, Bogsch said.  The share of biotechnological products in the global
pharmaceuticals market is set to increase, said the company.
Every third pharmaceutical product licensed in the European
Union was biotechnological, Richter said.  Richter shares  advanced  0.8 percent to 37,700 forint by
10:50 a.m. in Budapest, boosting this year’s gain to 9.8
percent. The benchmark BUX  stock index  as gained 2.5 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
