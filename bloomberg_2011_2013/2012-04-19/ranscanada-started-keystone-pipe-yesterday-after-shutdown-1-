TransCanada Corp. (TRP)  started the
590,000 barrel a day Keystone pipeline yesterday after it was
shut to retrieve an inspection device.  The pipeline is running according to schedule, Shawn Howard, a Calgary-based spokesman for the company, said in an e-
mail.  A portion of the cleaning device, known as a pig, broke and
became lodged in the line March 15 during maintenance upstream
from the line’s  Steele City , Nebraska, pump station, a person
familiar with the situation said March 19.  TransCanada will shut the Cushing leg of the Keystone
pipeline between April 27 and May 3 for planned maintenance, a
person familiar with the plans said April 11.  The 2,154-mile (3,466-kilometer) Keystone pipeline begins
in Hardisty,  Alberta , and can deliver oil to Cushing, Oklahoma,
and Illinois terminals through separate legs that diverge in
Steele City, according to the company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
