IAG’s  British Airways (IAG)  unit had its
fine for colluding to fix passenger fuel surcharges with Virgin
Atlantic Airways Ltd. cut by more than 50 percent to 58.5
million pounds ($94 million).  The latest fine from the  Office of Fair Trading  is lower
than a 121.5 million-pound sum imposed in 2007 because of legal
changes and the fact that BA’s assistance wasn’t properly
reflected in the original penalty, the antitrust regulator said.  The watchdog had accused British Airways of scheming with
Virgin Atlantic to fix fuel surcharges on trans-Atlantic flights
from July 2004 through April 2006. A criminal trial against four
former and current BA executives collapsed in 2010 amid problems
with evidence, including corrupted e-mails.  “The size of the fine underlines that it is important for
companies to take steps to ensure that they have an effective
compliance culture,” Ali Nikpay, the OFT’s senior director of
cartels and criminal enforcement, said today in a statement.
“The fine would have been higher still but for the co-operation
provided by BA throughout the OFT’s investigation.”  Virgin Atlantic wasn’t fined because it brought the matter
to the OFT’s attention. BA merged with  Spain ’s Iberia in January
to form International Consolidated Airlines Group SA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
