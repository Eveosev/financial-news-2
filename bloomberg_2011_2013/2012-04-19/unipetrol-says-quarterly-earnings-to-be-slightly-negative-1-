Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the biggest Czech oil
refiner, will probably report a first-quarter loss after a
slowdown in economic growth curtailed production.  Earnings before interest and tax will be “slightly
negative,” Prague-based Unipetrol said today in a trading
 statement . Crude oil throughput dropped 10 percent from the
previous three months to 906,000 metric tons, it said.  Earnings have been squeezed by rising crude prices and
lower demand as slower growth caps consumption.  Oil prices 
increased “significantly” in the first quarter to an average
$119 a barrel, Unipetrol said. Polish refiner PKN Orlen SA,
which controls 63 percent of Unipetrol, also said today it
expects to report a decline in quarterly operating profit.  Foreign-exchange rates will boost first-quarter earnings by
about 156 million koruna ($8.3 million), Unipetrol said. Sales
of carbon allowances will add about 155 million koruna.  Unipetrol dropped 1.1 percent to 170.20 koruna in Prague
trading as of 11:08 a.m. local time.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
