Morgan Stanley (MS) , the sixth-largest
 U.S. bank  by assets, set aside $2.11 billion to pay employees at
its investment-banking division in the first quarter, 10 percent
more than a year earlier.  Revenue at the unit rose 33 percent to $5 billion when the
impact of an accounting loss was excluded. Compensation at the
institutional-securities unit, which includes salaries, bonuses
and benefits for traders and bankers, was 42 percent of adjusted
revenue, down from 51 percent a year earlier when calculated on
the same basis, according to figures posted on the New York-
based firm’s  website .  Morgan Stanley has cut compensation, capped cash bonuses
and made clawbacks stricter as Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman , 53, seeks to improve returns amid an industrywide
decline in revenue. Gorman took a 25 percent pay cut for last
year’s performance, and the firm limited immediate cash bonuses
to $125,000 as the  shares fell  44 percent in 2011.  Companywide compensation and benefits rose 3 percent to
$4.43 billion as adjusted revenue increased 14 percent to $8.9
billion. That was enough to pay each of the firm’s 59,569
employees $74,384 on average for the period, more than the
$68,567 it set aside for each of the 62,494 employees a year
earlier, according to figures released today. The bank doesn’t
report how many people work in institutional securities.  The company recorded a $2 billion loss in the first quarter
from an accounting charge known as a debt valuation adjustment,
or DVA. It stems from increases in the value of the company’s
debt, under the theory that it would be more expensive to buy
back the securities. The $2 billion loss, which is included in
the institutional securities division, compares with a $189
million loss from DVA in the first quarter of last year, the
firm said today.  Morgan Stanley’s brokerage division, which employed 17,193
financial advisers at the end of March, down from 18,124 a year
earlier, set aside $2.105 billion for pay, little changed from
$2.109 billion in the first quarter of 2011. The unit’s
compensation cost, which is set by a fixed grid for some
employees, was 62 percent of its revenue, the same as a year
earlier, the firm reported.  JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  said this week that it set aside
$4.4 billion to compensate staff in the first quarter, 16
percent less than a year earlier and enough to give each of its
32,400 employees $135,123.  Compensation costs at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s investment
bank fell 12 percent to $2.9 billion in the first quarter,
according to figures posted on the firm’s website last week. The
expense was enough to pay each of the division’s 25,707 workers
an average of $112,849 for the first three months of the year.  The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the total compensation pool by the number of employees, and they
don’t represent individual workers’ actual pay. Investment banks
set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and typically
decide bonuses at year-end.  To contact the reporters on this story:
