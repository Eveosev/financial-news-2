Solar manufacturers will lead
consolidation in the clean-energy sector this year because of
overcapacity and declining government incentives, according to a
survey conducted by  Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF)   Mergers and acquisitions of solar companies will top those
of wind-turbine makers, biofuels, energy-storage and smart-grid
companies, according to 71 percent of respondents in a survey of
about 90 investors the investment bank conducted at its
conference in  New York  on Feb. 23.  “Solar needs to be rationalized,” Amy Smith, co-head of
cleantech  investment banking  at Jefferies in  San Francisco , said
yesterday in an interview. “It’s become somewhat of a commodity
industry.”  Solar-panel production capacity may exceed 38 gigawatts
this year, 53 percent more than the median demand
forecast, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Prices fell
by half last year, contributing to eight solar bankruptcies in
the U.S. and  Germany  since August.  Falling panel prices are also pulling down shares for
manufacturers, making solar the clean-tech segment investors are
most likely to avoid this year, according to the poll.  Cheap panels also make sun-powered plants more affordable,
which is why the poll also found that solar development is the
area most likely to attract investment, Smith said.  Almost half the respondents said offshore  wind turbines 
won’t become a significant component of global energy sources
until at least 2017 and one-quarter said they never will.  To contact the reporter on this story:
