Latvia’s budget deficit narrowed by
more than half last year on the government’s spending cuts and
tax increases.  The shortfall shrank to 3.5 percent of economic output from
8.2 percent in 2010, the Riga-based central statistics office
 said  in a statement today, citing figures adjusted for European
Union methodology. The general government deficit fell to 494.1
million lati ($927 million) last year from about 1 billion lati
in 2010.  The Baltic country’s  economy  expanded 5.5 percent last
year, bolstered by growth in exports and industrial production,
after shrinking almost a quarter in 2008 and 2009. Latvia
completed a 7.5 billion-euro ($9.8 billion) bailout from a group
led by the  International Monetary Fund  and European Union, after
passing tax increases and spending cuts of almost 18 percent of
gross domestic product since the end of 2008.  The  Finance Ministry  expects the economy to expand about 2
percent this year with a budget deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP so
it can meet criteria to adopt the euro in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
