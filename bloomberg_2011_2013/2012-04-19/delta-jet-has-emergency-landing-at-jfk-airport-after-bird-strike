A  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)   Boeing Co. (BA) 
757 jet departing from New York’s John F. Kennedy International
Airport made an emergency landing after a bird strike on the
right engine.  Flight 1063 encountered the bird or birds on takeoff and
the captain decided to return to Kennedy as a precaution,
 Anthony Black , a spokesman for Atlanta-based Delta, said in an
e-mailed message. The twin-engine plane was bound for Los
Angeles and carried 179 passengers and crew.  No injuries were reported, and the crew didn’t need to
deploy emergency slides, Black said. Delta is working to rebook
passengers on other flights, he said.  Bird strikes can cripple aircraft, as happened in the
January 2009 ditching of a US Airways Group Inc. jet into  New
York ’s Hudson River after both engines lost power. The Airbus
SAS A320 bobbed in the water while all 155 people aboard were
rescued in what became known as the “Miracle on the Hudson.”  Captain Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger and co-pilot Jeffrey
Skiles became overnight celebrities for safely gliding the plane
into the river minutes after takeoff from New York’s LaGuardia
airport. The Smithsonian Institution later found that the jet
hit at least three migrating Canada geese, which weigh 8 pounds
(3.6 kilograms) on average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
