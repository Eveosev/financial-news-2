Tomra Systems ASA (TOM) , a Norwegian
maker of machines that collect cans and bottles for recycling,
lost a court challenge to a 24-million-euro ($31.5 million)
antitrust fine by European Union regulators for stifling
competition.  The EU’s Court of Justice upheld the fine imposed by the
European Commission in 2006.  Tomra’s practice of offering rebates and discounts to
retailers restricted the market for competitors, the regulator
said in 2006. The decision closed an investigation that began
with raids in  Norway ,  Germany  and the Netherlands in September
2001. Tomra argued the commission used “misleading” evidence
in deciding to levy such a heavy fine in its appeals to the EU
General Court in 2010 and again in this case before the Court of
Justice.  The fine, at more than 7 percent of Tomra’s 2005  sales , was
the highest penalty levied as a percentage of revenue in this
type of abuse case, the EU regulator said in 2006.  The ruling from the region’s highest court is binding.
Tomra lost a lower court appeal against the fine.  The case is  C-549/10 P  Tomra Systems and Others v
Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
