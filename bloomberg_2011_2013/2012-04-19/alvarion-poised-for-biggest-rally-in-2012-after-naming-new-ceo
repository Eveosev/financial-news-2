Alvarion Ltd. (ALVR)  headed for its
biggest advance in four months in New York trading after the
Israeli maker of wireless communication equipment named a new
chief executive officer.  The shares rose 7.9 percent to 67 cents at 2:58 p.m. in New
York, set for the biggest gain since Dec. 8. Alvarion’s  Tel Aviv (ALVR) 
stock rose 4.4 percent to 2.4 shekels, or the equivalent of 64
cents.  Hezi Lapid will replace Eran Gorev as Alvarion’s CEO on May
6, the Tel Aviv-based company said in a Business Wire statement
today. Shares of Alvarion sank 30 percent on April 5 after the
company cut its first-quarter revenue forecast. The stock has
dropped 26 percent this year, compared with a 14 percent advance
by the Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index of the biggest New York-
traded Israeli companies.  “There has been a lot of pressure from investors to take
the company in another direction,” Andrew Uerkwitz, a senior
analyst at Oppenheimer & Co Inc., said in a phone interview from
 New York . “With a new CEO, there is some confidence that it’s
going to get back on track.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
