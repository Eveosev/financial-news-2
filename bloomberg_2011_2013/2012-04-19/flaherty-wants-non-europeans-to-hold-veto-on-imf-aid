Canada is proposing that non-
Europeans should have a veto over the role that the
 International Monetary Fund  can play in providing aid to  Europe ,
Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said today.  “Because of the large number of European seats on the
board of the IMF, some of us, and Canada certainly, is of the
view that we ought to have two keys, in effect,” Flaherty told
reporters in Washington today.  “We would have one vote by the euro zone countries and
another vote for approval by the non-euro zone countries” on
the issue of aid for Europe, he said.  Flaherty said the IMF has adequate resources to deal with
any “imminent situation,” while Europeans need to put more
resources into a “firewall” to prevent the region’s crisis
from spreading.  Asked if his IMF governance proposal meant that non-
Europeans would have a veto on aid for the region, Flaherty said
yes, adding he expects an “animated” discussion on the issue
at meetings of Group of 20 officials in  Washington  today and
tomorrow.  “Given the major challenge here is a sovereign debt
challenge in euro zone countries and the euro zone countries are
asking non-euro zone countries to contribute to resources at the
IMF, our view is there ought to be two votes,” Flaherty said.  Flaherty also said he’s raised concerns with IMF Managing
Director  Christine Lagarde  about the “troika” system that is
being applied by the IMF in Europe, where the agency jointly
monitors aid to European countries with the European Union and
the  European Central Bank .  “That’s not the traditional way the IMF operates,”
Flaherty said. “Traditionally, the IMF would direct what needed
to be done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
