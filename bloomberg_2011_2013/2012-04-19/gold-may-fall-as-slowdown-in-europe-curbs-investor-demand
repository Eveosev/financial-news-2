Gold futures rose as the dollar
pared gains, boosting demand for the precious metal as an
alternative asset.  The greenback was little changed against a basket of major
currencies after climbing as much as 0.4 percent.  Christine
Lagarde , the managing director of the  International Monetary
Fund , said at a press briefing in Washington that she expects
the resources of the IMF to be “significantly increased” amid
Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis.  “This is supportive news for gold, as we’re seeing the
euro strengthen now,”  Frank Lesh , a trader at FuturePath
Trading in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “This means
more free money, and gold likes that.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose 0.1 percent to settle
at $1,641.40 an ounce at 1:50 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price dropped as much as 0.5 percent.  Silver futures for May delivery gained 0.9 percent to
$31.779 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
July delivery slid 0.1 percent to $1,578 an ounce, and palladium
futures for June delivery rose 0.9 percent to $663.30 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
