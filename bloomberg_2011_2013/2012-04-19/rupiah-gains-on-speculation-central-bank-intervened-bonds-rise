Indonesia ’s rupiah gained on
speculation the central bank sought a stronger currency to slow
inflation. Bonds rose.  Bank Indonesia  intervened in the foreign-exchange and debt
markets to stabilize the exchange rate, according to an April 12
 statement  on its website. The monetary authority attributed
recent losses in the rupiah, the worst performer among  Asia ’s 10
most-traded currencies excluding the yen this year, to
expectations for faster local  inflation  and a global economic
slowdown, and dollar demand from importers.  “Bank Indonesia hopes the strengthening rupiah will
support the economy,” said Gusti Kahari, a foreign-exchange
dealer at PT Bank Artha Graha Internasional in Jakarta.  The rupiah gained 0.6 percent to 9,130 per dollar as of
4:31 p.m. in Jakarta, the biggest advance in more than six
weeks, according to prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, which measures
 exchange-rate  swings used to price options, was steady at 6.50
percent.  Annual inflation quickened to 3.97 percent in March from
3.56 percent the previous month, acclerating for the first time
since August 2011, government data show. The central bank is
shifting its policy focus to consumer-price gains from economic
growth, Perry Warjiyo, director of economic research and
monetary policy, said on April 17.  Bond Sale  Indonesia sold $2.5 billion of dollar-denominated bonds,
with investors bidding for 3.2 times more than the amount
offered, the  finance ministry  said yesterday.  The government issued $2 billion of notes due in April 2022
to yield 3.85 percent, or 184 basis points more than that for
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It also sold $500 million more of 5.25 percent bonds
due 2042 at a yield of 4.95 percent, 181 basis points more than
 U.S. debt .  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
fell six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to a nearly
two-week low of 5.93 percent, according to closing prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
