Landry’s Inc. $1.03 billion  term
loan  to refinance debt rose in its first day of trading,
according to data provider Markit Group Ltd.  The debt for the owner of Rainforest Café and Bubba Gump
Shrimp Co. was quoted today at 99.75 cents on the dollar,
according to Markit. The loan was sold to investors at 98.5
cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Jefferies Group Inc. arranged the financing for the
Houston-based company, the data show.  The loan pays interest at 5.25 percentage points more than
the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.25 percent floor,
Bloomberg data show. Libor, the rate at which banks say they can
borrow in dollars from each other, serves as a reference for
about $360 trillion of financial instruments worldwide.  Lenders will receive one-year soft-call protection of 101
cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more than
face value to refinance the debt during the first year.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
