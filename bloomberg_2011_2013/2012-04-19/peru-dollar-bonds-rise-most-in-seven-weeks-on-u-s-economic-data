Peruvian dollar-denominated bonds
rose the most in seven weeks as speculation borrowing costs will
remain low in the U.S. to bolster growth spurred demand for
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 dropped four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 4.48 percent at 3:07 p.m. in Lima. The
bond’s price rose 0.74 cent to 130.91 cents per dollar.  U.S. reports today showed existing-home sales unexpectedly
fell 2.6 percent, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s
manufacturing index trailed estimates and jobless claims
exceeded projections. China’s central bank pledged to ensure
adequate availability of cash in the financial system by using
tools including reductions in the reserve-requirement ratio,
state media reported. The  central bank of India (CBOI)  April 17 cut
borrowing costs for the first time since 2009.  “In an environment of slower global growth and lower rates
as a consequence, emerging-market bonds will be in demand,”
said  Diego Donadio , a Latin America strategist at BNP Paribas in
Sao Paulo.  The sol was unchanged at 2.6540 per  U.S. dollar , according
to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  The country’s central bank bought $62 million in the  spot
market  today to stem gains in the sol. It paid an average 2.6540
soles per U.S. dollar, according to a statement on the bank’s
website.  Exports and foreign direct investment will help drive the
sol to around 2.60 this year, though the central bank may use
dollar purchases to prevent the sol from advancing beyond 2.65
in the short term, said  Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in an
e-mailed note to clients.  To contact the reporter on this story:
