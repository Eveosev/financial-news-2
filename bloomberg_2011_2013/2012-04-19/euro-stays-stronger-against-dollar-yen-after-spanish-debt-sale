The euro stayed higher against the
dollar and yen after  Spain  sold more than its maximum target at
a debt sale.  The euro was 0.2 percent stronger at $1.3147 at 9:46 a.m.
London time. It advanced 0.5 percent to 107.14 yen.  Spain sold 2.54 billion euros of two-year and 10-year
bonds, compared with a maximum target of 2.5 billion euros.  Demand for the 10-year debt was 2.42 times the amount sold,
compared with 2.17 at the Jan. 19 sale, and the bid-to-cover for
the bonds maturing in October 2014 was 3.28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
