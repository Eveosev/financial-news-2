What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures for delivery are called to open 10 cents to 12
cents a bushel higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade on
speculation that demand for U.S. supplies will rise after prices
slumped to a four-month low yesterday,  Jim Gerlach , the
president of A/C Trading Inc. in Fowler, Indiana, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open up 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel on the
CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the Minneapolis Grain
Exchange on speculation that dry weather threatening some crops
in southern Europe, Russia and China may boost sales of U.S.
grain, which dropped near a three-month low yesterday, Gerlach
said.  -- Soybean futures may open 12 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago after a government report showed declining production
in  South America  boosted overseas purchases of U.S. oilseeds and
soy-based animal feed, Gerlach said. Soybean-oil futures are
expected to open 0.3 cent to 0.4 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open up $3 to $5 per 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
