President  Barack Obama ’s re-
election probably would push the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
lower this November because investors see his policies as
“anti-business,” according to Steven Leuthold, chief executive
officer and founder of the  Leuthold Global Fund. (GLBLX)   “Obama is leading to some degree, and I think if Obama is
re-elected it would be somewhat of a negative for the market,”
Leuthold said in an interview today on Bloomberg Television’s
“In the Loop” with Betty Liu. “He’s kind of viewed still as
anti-business. He has a lot of support from  Wall Street  in terms
of money. I’m a social liberal but I’m a fiscal conservative.”  The  S&P 500  will fail to reach its highs of 2007 as
investors await the results of the election, Leuthold said. The
benchmark gauge has climbed 10 percent this year through
yesterday and reached 1,419.04 on April 2, about 10 percent from
the record 1,565.15 it hit in October 2007. The measure has
since lost about 2.4 percent after the  Federal Reserve  signaled
it was refraining from further monetary stimulus.  In mid-February, the  S&P 500 (SPX)  was posting its best start to
a year since 1991 as Obama’s re-election odds increased,
according to bets placed on Dublin-based bookmaker Intrade. The
index has rallied 63 percent since Obama took office on Jan.
20, 2009.  Leuthold said in January that he was bullish on U.S. stocks
in the near future. The Leuthold Global Fund has beat 71 percent
of its rivals in 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
He said today he likes airline stocks.  “Between now and the election, nothing is going to happen
in terms of the deficit and bringing it down or anything like
that,” he said. “We’ve never gridlock quite as bad as we have
it now. You have no cooperation between Democrats and
Republicans at this point and that’s what really bothers me in
terms of them really getting something done.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
