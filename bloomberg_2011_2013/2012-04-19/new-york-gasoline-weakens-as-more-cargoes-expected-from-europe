New York  gasoline weakened against
futures for a fifth day as the number of cargoes sent from
 Europe  was expected to rise, adding to supply.  Gasoline shipments to the U.S. from the continent are set
to climb 31 percent over the next two weeks, a Bloomberg survey
showed. Traders and oil companies booked 10 tankers for the two
weeks to May 3, and 11 more are likely to be hired, according to
the median estimate in a survey yesterday of seven shipbrokers,
traders and owners.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor widened 0.75 cent to 6.13
cents a gallon versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 2:03 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Prompt delivery fell 5.61 cents to $3.9029 a gallon.  Gasoline production may also rise in Europe with  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  starting units this week following maintenance
at its Pernis oil refinery in Rotterdam, Europe’s largest
facility.  A platformer and hydrodesulfurization Unit 3 are resuming
operations while maintenance on HDS 1 and HDS 2 will begin early
next week, according to two people familiar with the work who
declining to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak publicly on the matter.  Regular gasoline in the  Gulf Coast  widened its discount
0.75 cent to 16.25 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
