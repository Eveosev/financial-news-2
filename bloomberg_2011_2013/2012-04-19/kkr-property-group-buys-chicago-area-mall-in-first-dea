KKR & Co. (KKR) , the private-equity firm
run by  Henry Kravis  and  George Roberts , bought a regional mall
outside of  Chicago  for about $196 million in the first U.S.
acquisition under its new real estate division.  KKR is investing with YTC Pacific in Yorktown Center, a
1.5 million-square-foot (139,000-square-meter) mall with more
than 150 stores, the New York-based buyout firm said today in a
statement. The property, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) west of
downtown Chicago, has more than $280 million in annual revenue,
and has been under private ownership since it opened in 1968.  Private-equity managers are zeroing in on property
investments as the world’s top buyout firms accelerate an
expansion beyond corporate takeovers. KKR last year hired former
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive Ralph Rosenberg as its first
head of real estate to move into the business.  KKR aims to bolster Yorktown Center “through a combination
of proactive management, a focus on leasing, cosmetic and other
improvements,” Rosenberg said in the statement.  Private-equity firms are betting they can produce profits
in a still choppy real estate market because their capital is
locked up for long periods, usually a decade, allowing them to
make improvements and wait out short-term price swings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
