Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the
world’s largest brokerage, said its net exposure to five of
 Europe ’s most-indebted nations was $2.41 billion, down from
$3.06 billion in January.  Morgan Stanley’s net exposure to the five countries --
Greece, Ireland,  Italy , Portugal and Spain -- was $4.01 billion
before hedges, according to figures posted yesterday on the New
York-based bank’s  website . Net exposure to  France  rose to $4.14
billion from $1.71 billion as of Dec. 31.  Concern that Europe’s debt crisis would spark bank losses
contributed to a 41 percent  tumble  for Morgan Stanley’s shares
in the third quarter of last year. The firm said in October that
its net exposure to the five was $3 billion, helping halt the
decline of the shares.  Spain  accounted for the majority of the net exposure to the
so-called GIIPS nations, with $1.32 billion. That included $833
million in unfunded commitments, and a negative $493 million in
net inventory. The firm had a net short position of $137 million
on Portugal. A short position is a wager the price of a security
will fall.  Morgan Stanley had $6.44 billion of net exposure to the
five countries, including $4.9 billion to Italy, as of Dec. 31.
After it restructured a derivative with the Italian government,
which settled on Jan. 3, those amounts dropped to $3.06 billion
and $1.52 billion, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
