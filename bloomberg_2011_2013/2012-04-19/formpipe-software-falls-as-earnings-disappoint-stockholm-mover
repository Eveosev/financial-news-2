FormPipe Software AB (FPIP) , a Swedish
software company, fell the most in more than eight months in
Stockholm trading after first-quarter net income was dragged
down by higher staff costs.  The shares declined as much as 12 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since Aug. 5. FormPipe traded 7.6 percent lower at
14.70 kronor as of 9:32 a.m.  FormPipe, which focuses mainly on so-called enterprise
content management for the Swedish public sector, said net
income declined to 2.2 million kronor ($0.3 million) from 4.9
million kronor a year earlier as sales declined 4.4 percent and
staff costs increased by 10 percent. The company seeks to expand
in the life science industry, tapping into its expertise in
environments with high regulatory demands and taking advantage
of regulations being similar globally, FormPipe said.  “The company’s two main segments are seen relatively
unaffected by economic fluctuations,” FormPipe said today in a
statement. The company said its board considers acquisitions
“as a good complement to organic growth.”  Sales declined to 28.1 million kronor from 29.4 million
kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
