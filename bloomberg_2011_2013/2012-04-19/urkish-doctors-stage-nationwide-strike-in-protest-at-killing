Turkish doctors are going on a
nationwide strike today to protest against violence after the
killing of a surgeon this week by a patient’s family member in
the southeastern city of Gaziantep.  The strike is being organized by the Turkish Medical
Association, which said in a  statement  on its website that
health-care professionals will protest by carrying out only
 emergency services  today.  Violence against healthcare professionals in  Turkey  has
worsened to the point of being “unbearable” and government
officials have failed to address the issue, the statement said.  Ersin Arslan, a 30-year-old surgeon, was killed April 17
when the 17-year-old grandson of a patient who died in his care
attacked him with a knife, Milliyet newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
