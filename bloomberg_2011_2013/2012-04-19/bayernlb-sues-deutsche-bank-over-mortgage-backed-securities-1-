Bayerische Landesbank , the second-
biggest German state-owned lender, sued  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  in New
York state court over $810 million of residential mortgage-
backed securities.  The suit, filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan
yesterday, accuses Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank of fraud in
connection with the sale of the securities, pools of home loans
securitized into bonds that were a central part of the housing
bubble that helped send the U.S. into the biggest recession
since the 1930s.  “Deutsche Bank originated, purchased, financed and
securitized exceptionally high-risk loans into these RMBS, all
while internally disparaging the poor quality of these loans and
the RMBS they backed as ‘pigs’ and ‘crap,’” lawyers for Munich-
based BayernLB said in the lawsuit.  Deutsche Bank believes the claims are without merit and
will “vigorously” defend itself, spokesman  Duncan King  said in
a telephone interview. The Frankfurt-based bank is Germany’s
biggest lender.  The case is Bayerische Landesbank v. Deutsche Bank AG,
651264/2012, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
