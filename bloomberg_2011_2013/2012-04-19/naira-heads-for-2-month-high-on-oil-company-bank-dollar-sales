Nigeria ’s naira headed for its
highest close in two months as the state oil company was said to
sell dollars and after auctions from the central bank.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer advanced 0.1
percent to 157.1 per dollar on the  interbank market  as of 12:25
p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The naira has risen 3.3 percent this
year.  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. periodically sells
dollars to lenders to meet local spending needs. The oil
industry is the second major supplier of foreign exchange to the
market after the  Central Bank of Nigeria , which sold $270
million at foreign currency at auctions on Monday and Wednesday
this week to stabilize the naira.  Sales from NNPC “have provided support” for the naira,
 Leon Myburgh  and Coura Fall, Africa strategists at Citigroup
Inc. in Johannesburg, wrote in a note to clients today.  Nigeria’s foreign-exchange reserves have risen 9.8 percent
this year to $36.15 billion as of April 17, according to data
from the Abuja-based central bank. The West African nation’s
benchmark Bonny Light crude has risen 8.5 percent this year.  “We continue to view developments in the CBN foreign
exchange reserves as central to whether the bank will able to
maintain” its 155 naira per dollar peg at auctions, Myburgh and
Fall said. “If we do see incremental gains in the reserves, it
will empower the CBN to keep the naira stable through 2012.”  The yield on Nigeria’s $500 million of dollar bonds due
2021 fell was little changed at 5.427 percent. Borrowing costs
of domestic bonds due 2015 rose two basis points to 15.13
percent, according to the April 18 data on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association website.  Ghana ’s cedi rose less than 0.1 percent to 1.8215 per
dollar in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
