Treasury 10-year note yields traded
below 2 percent for a fifth day on concern the European debt
crisis may worsen and as U.S. jobless claims and home sales
missed forecasts, stoking demand for the safest assets.  The U.S.  10-year note  has stayed within seven basis points
of 2 percent for almost two weeks in the longest stretch below
the level since February. Yields increased at French and Spanish
bond auctions, underlining concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is
far from over. The U.S. sold a record $16 billion in inflation-
linked securities at an all-time low negative yield.  “Fixed-income investors are not ignoring the fact that,
over the last three weeks, economic data has been worsening,”
said  Dan Greenhaus , chief global strategist at the broker-dealer
BTIG LLC in New York. “Europe is obviously an important portion
of the story.”  The 10-year  yield  fell one basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to 1.97 percent at 5 p.m. New York time, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2 percent note due February
2022 rose 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face value, to 100 9/32.
The yield has stayed between 1.94 percent to 2.07 percent since
April 7.  U.S. government debt  was little changed this year as of
yesterday, while Treasury Inflation Protected Securities rose
2.5 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch Indexes.  TIPS Auction  The five-year TIPS were auctioned at a so-called high yield
of negative 1.08 percent, the Treasury said, the fifth straight
auction with investors willing to pay a premium to guard against
the threat of rising consumer prices. The fixed payment on five-
year TIPS, known as the real yield, was pushed below zero as the
rise in the  consumer price index  was greater than the yield on
regular five-year U.S. notes.  Consumer prices increased 2.7 percent in the 12 months
ended in March, the smallest 12-month gain in a year, Labor
Department figures showed April 13.  “You are are paying for the privilege of lending to the
U.S. government,” said Eric Van Nostrand, an interest-rate
strategist in  New York  at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of 21
primary dealers required to trade Treasuries with the Fed.
“It’s the demand for the safest assets. The universe of safe
assets that the market perceives as nearly risk free is
dwindling.”  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity TIPS, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer
prices over the life of the debt, has widened to 2.23 percentage
points from 1.95 percentage points at the end of 2011.  The U.S. announced it will sell $35 billion of two-year
notes on April 24, the same amount of five-year debt the
following day and $29 billion of seven-year debt on April 26.  ‘Overpriced’ Market  Valuation measures show Treasuries are at the most
expensive level in six weeks. The term premium, a model created
by economists at the Fed, reached negative 0.67 percent, the
most expensive since March 7. It closed at negative 0.64
percent. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to
accept yields below what’s considered fair value.  “The bond market’s overpriced,” Daniel Fuss, vice
chairman of Loomis Sayles & Co., said in a Bloomberg Television
interview on “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene .
“Treasuries are priced higher than a kite. We’ll stay
overpriced as long as our central bank and the banks offshore
want it to be.”  The Fed  purchased  $1.668 billion of Treasuries due from
August 2022 to February 2031 today as part of a plan to replace
$400 billion of shorter-term debt in its holdings with longer
maturities to keep borrowing costs down and boost the economy,
according to the New York Fed’s website.  ‘Fiscal Concerns’  Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which measures
Treasury price swings based on options, dropped to 72.2 basis
points, below this year’s average of 79 basis points. It reached
93.3 basis points on March 20, the highest level this year.  Trading  volume  was below average today, with about $205
billion of Treasuries changing hands through ICAP Plc, the
world’s largest interdealer broker as of 5:01 p.m. in New York.
Volume reached $439 billion on March 14, the highest since
August. The average in 2012 is $252 billion.  Treasuries have fluctuated between gains and losses each
day this week. They rose yesterday as concern about Europe’s
debt crisis boosted demand for the safest assets.  “The market is once again reminded of the broader credit
and fiscal concerns facing Europe,” said  Ian Lyngen , a
government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut .  Spain, France  Spain  auctioned 2.54 billion euros of two- and 10-year
debt, compared with a maximum target of 2.5 billion euros ($3.34
billion). The nation sold its 10-year benchmark bonds at an
average yield of 5.743 percent, compared with 5.403 percent when
it last sold them in January.  France  sold 2.7 billion euros of benchmark five-year debt
at an average yield of 1.83 percent, up from 1.78 percent on
March 15. It also sold notes due in September 2014 and April
2015 and index-linked securities.  The bonds sales came amid Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano
Rajoy ’s struggle to meet deficit targets and as the French
presidential elections have driven up yields in the euro area.  Jobless claims rose last week to 386,000, a Labor
Department report showed. The median forecast of 47 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a drop in jobless claims to
370,000 in the week ending April 14 from a revised 388,000 the
previous week.  ‘Weaker Data’  Sales of previously owned U.S. homes in March unexpectedly
fell for the third time in the last four months, with purchases
dropping 2.6 percent to a 4.48 million annual rate from 4.6
million in February, the National Association of Realtors
reported in  Washington . The median forecast of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey called for an increase to 4.61 million. In
January, sales at a 4.63 million rate were the strongest since
May 2010.  Home starts slowed to a five-month low in March, the
Commerce Department said April 17.  “Europe is scaring a lot of people again,” said  Charles Comiskey , head of Treasury trading at primary dealer  Bank of
Nova Scotia (BNS)  in New York. “Things seem to be deteriorating and
that brings nervousness into the U.S. Treasury market. You are
getting weaker data in the U.S.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
