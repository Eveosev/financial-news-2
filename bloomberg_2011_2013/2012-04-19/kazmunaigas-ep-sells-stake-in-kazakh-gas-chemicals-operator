KazMunaiGas Exploration Production (RDGZ) ,
the London-listed unit of  Kazakhstan ’s state energy producer,
sold its majority stake in a company that’s building a
petrochemicals plant in the region of Atyrau.  KazMunaiGas EP sold a 51 percent interest in  Kazakhstan
Petrochemical Industries Inc.  to state-owned United Chemical
Co., according to a statement today. KazMunaiGas will receive a
net gain of 4.86 billion tenge ($33 million) from the
transaction, the company said.  Kazakhstan set up United Chemical in 2008 to lessen the
economy’s reliance on exports of raw materials. An affiliate is
overseeing the construction of a $6.3 billion gas chemicals
complex to produce polypropylene and polyethylene, used to make
plastics, according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
