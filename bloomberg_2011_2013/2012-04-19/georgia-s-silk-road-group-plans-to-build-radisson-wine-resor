Silk Road Group , one of  Georgia ’s
biggest private-investment companies, will begin construction of
a $20 million Radisson hotel and winery in the Black Sea region
country.  Radisson will manage the 100-room hotel at Tsinandali in
the Kakhetia region, Silk Road Chairman Giorgi Ramishvili said
in an interview. New York-based John Fotiadis Architect PLLC has
been hired to design the hotel and the renovation of the
accompanying winery.  Silk Road is taking part in the development of the 45-story
Trump Tower in the capital, Tbilisi.  Donald J. Trump  is expected
to visit the Adjara region on Georgia’s Black Sea coast on April
21 as part of the project’s introduction, Ramishvili said.  Georgia was ranked as the world’s third-fastest growing
tourist destination last year, with a 39 percent increase in
international arrivals, according to a March report by the World
Tourism Barometer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
