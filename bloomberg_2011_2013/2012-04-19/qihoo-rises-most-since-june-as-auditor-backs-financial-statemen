Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU) , a Chinese
developer of computer security software, surged the most in 10
months after a  filing  showed that auditor  Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu  consented to its financial statements for 2010 and
2011.  Qihoo’s American depositary receipts climbed 20 percent,
the most since June 7, to $24.68 at 3:31 p.m. New York time. The
ADRs earlier soared as much as 27 percent to $26.18.  Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu said the company’s “consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position” of Qihoo as of Dec. 31, 2010 and 2011.  The filing demonstrated that Qihoo’s “financial figures
were checked and audited, which is a good refutation of
allegations by some short sellers on its business and a positive
to its stock,” said Qi Guo, research analyst on U.S.-listed
Chinese Internet stocks at ThinkEquity Partners LLC in  San
Francisco .  Qihoo rejected in an April 3 statement allegations that
were raised in a Forbes magazine article a day earlier that
Qihoo’s “revenue model” had changed since its IPO. The company
also refuted accusations by companies including short seller
Citron Research, which disputed Qihoo’s sources of revenue in
reports since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
