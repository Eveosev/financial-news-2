Lowe’s Cos. (LOW)  promoted Rick Damron to
the newly created position of chief operating officer to help
the second-biggest U.S. home improvement retailer draw more
customers to stores and online.  Damron, 49, was previously executive vice president of
store operations, the Mooresville, North Carolina-based company
said in a statement. Gregory Bridgeford, 57, was promoted to
chief customer officer, also a new position, from executive vice
president of business development. Their new jobs start May 5.  CEO Robert Niblock has closed stores and eliminated jobs
while adding thousands of items for sale online after the
company trailed  Home Depot Inc. (HD)  in sales by stores open at least
a year in 2011. Damron, who joined Lowe’s in 1981, and
Bridgeford, who arrived a year later, will lead efforts to boost
Web sales and improve store operations.  Same-store stores at Lowe’s were flat in 2011, compared
with Home Depot’s gain of 3.4 percent.  Lowe’s gained 0.1 percent to $32 at the close in  New York .
The shares have climbed 26 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
