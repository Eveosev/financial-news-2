The  International Monetary Fund 
said its priority is to contain the European debt turmoil as it
also looks at lessons from the global financial crisis.  “In order to facilitate the recovery from the global
financial crisis, the most immediate priority is to help restore
financial stability, notably but not only in the euro area, and
limit potential spillovers to other regions,” the IMF said in
in its agenda for financial surveillance released today. “This
priority informs not only financial surveillance but also the
Fund’s technical assistance and lending operations.”  The agenda is part of the fund’s efforts to improve its
surveillance after an internal audit released last year found
that the IMF was overly influenced by developed countries,
including the U.S. and the U.K., when assessing their economies
and ended up missing signs of fragility that led to the 2008
global financial crisis.  Priorities for the longer term focus on how to help member
countries better detect risks, build more resilient financial
systems and manage crises, according to the program.  Measures in Managing Director  Christine Lagarde ’s “action
plan” include assigning a financial expert when IMF teams
conduct annual assessments of countries’ economies and improving
the availability of financial sector information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
