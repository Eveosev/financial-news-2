RTB Bor,  Serbia ’s sole copper
producer, seeks a 55 million-euro ($72.2 million) loan from the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to expand.  The funds would help build a wastewater treatment plant and
a slag flotation facility, the Bor, Serbia-based company’s
spokeswoman Gorica Toncev-Vasilic said in a phone interview
today. The loan will complement a current 175 million-euro
investment in a new smelter and a sulphuric acid plant, she
said.  The state-run copper miner and smelter needs EBRD support
to cut pollution and increase capacity, she said.  The construction of the new smelter and the sulphuric acid
plant is supported by a 135 million-euro credit from Export
Development  Canada .  To contact the reporter on this story:
