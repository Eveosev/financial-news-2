SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) , which makes memory
chips used in mobile devices, fell the most in three months
after forecasting second-quarter sales that fell short of some
analysts’ estimates.  The Milpitas, California-based company said revenue will
 decline  to about $1 billion, plus or minus $50 million. Analysts
on average had estimated sales of $1.28 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Chip production at SanDisk and its rivals is outpacing
demand, causing prices to fall, Chief Executive Officer Sanjay Mehrotra said on a conference call with analysts yesterday. Some
of the company’s customers also ordered fewer chips for mobile
phones than SanDisk had predicted, he said.  SanDisk shares fell 11 percent to $35.91 at the close in
New York, for the biggest decline since Jan. 26. The stock has
dropped 27 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
