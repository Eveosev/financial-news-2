Citic Pacific Ltd. (267)  is offering to
pay an all-in rate of about 280 basis points more than the Hong
Kong interbank offered rate for a loan of at least HK$3 billion
($387 million), two people familiar with the matter said.  The loan will be used for investment in an iron ore project
in  Australia , according to the people said, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. Citic Pacific
arranged a visit for bankers to its sites in the country earlier
this month, they said.  Citic Pacific, based in Hong Kong, has given banks until
about April 20 to respond with commitment proposals, the people
said. The loan may be as much as HK$4 billion, depending on how
much lenders commit, they said.  Marjorie Law, a spokeswoman at Brunswick Group LLP, which
handles media relations for Citic Pacific, wasnâ€™t immediately
available to comment on the financing when reached by telephone
in her  Hong Kong  office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
