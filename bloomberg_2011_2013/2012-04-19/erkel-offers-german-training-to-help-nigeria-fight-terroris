Chancellor  Angela Merkel  offered
German help to Nigeria as  Africa ’s most populous nation attempts
to counter attacks by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram.  There’s a need “to discuss in which ways Nigeria needs
help,” Merkel said after talks with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in Berlin today. “But what’s most important is the
Nigerian government’s determination to counter the threat.
Wherever we can help -- with training, with logistics -- we will
do so.”  Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer, has suffered
terrorist attacks at the hands of Boko Haram including a suicide
bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Abuja in August.
The U.S. Embassy in Nigeria warned its citizens on April 17 that
the group may be planning more attacks in the capital.  Jonathan said that he can assure investors the Nigerian
government is “on top of” the terrorist threat.  Some accounts paint “a gloomy picture as if the whole
country is in tatters” because of the attacks, Jonathan said in
Berlin.  Nigeria  is “a safe place” for investment, he said.
“We are a stable country.”  The two leaders said that they also discussed energy
projects as well as education and cultural cooperation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
