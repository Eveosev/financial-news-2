United Nations Security Council
members are in broad agreement to be ready to authorize the
deployment of about 300 cease-fire observers to  Syria  in coming
weeks even as they remain concerned about Syrian government
violations of the week-old truce, according to two UN diplomats.  The council was briefed today by deputies to  Kofi Annan ,
the UN special envoy who brokered a peace plan for Syria. They
urged the UN’s decision-making body to give the go-ahead for an
expanded monitoring mission while acknowledging risks on the
ground from continued violence, according to the diplomats, who
spoke on condition of anonymity because the briefing wasn’t
public.  Syria and the UN agreed today on a set of rules for unarmed
monitors to be safe and able to move around the country safely,
according to a UN statement. A small advance team is already in
Syria.  The agreement doesn’t yet provide for air support, which is
vital for the protection of the observers, the diplomats said.
The Syrian government so far hasn’t raised objections about the
nationalities of the observers, the diplomats said.  The Annan deputies who briefed the council were Jean-Marie
Guehenno, former UN under secretary-general for peacekeeping at
the UN, and Edmond Mulet, UN assistant secretary-general for
peacekeeping.  To contact the reporter on this story:
