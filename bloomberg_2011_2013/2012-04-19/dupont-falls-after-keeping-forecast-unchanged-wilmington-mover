DuPont Co. (DD) , the most valuable U.S.
chemicals producer, fell after disappointing investors who
expected the company to raise its 2012 profit forecast after
posting higher-than-expected first-quarter earnings.  Dupont dropped as much as 2.2 percent, the biggest intraday
decline since Feb. 14, before closing 1.2 percent lower at
$52.61 in  New York .  Net income rose to $1.57 a share in the three months
through March, from $1.52 a year earlier, Wilmington, Delaware-
based DuPont said today in a statement. Profit excluding costs
related to damage caused by the herbicide Imprelis was $1.61,
topping the $1.53 average of 13 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  A warmer-than-normal spring boosted U.S. and European sales
of pesticides and genetically modified seeds, bringing forward
to the first quarter 3 cents a share in earnings that would
typically occur in the second quarter, Jim Borel, executive vice
president of DuPont’s agriculture unit, said on a conference
call.  The decision not to raise full-year guidance “might prove
disappointing to some investors in light of the strong first-
quarter results as it could imply that some of the strength
reflected a pull forward of Ag earnings due to the early start
to the U.S. planting season,” Don Carson, a New York-based
analyst at Susquehanna Financial, said today in a report.  DuPont reiterated its January forecast that adjusted
earnings will climb to $4.20 to $4.40 a share this year, from
$3.93 in 2011. That compares with the $4.27  average estimate  of
17 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  DuPont also said first-quarter net sales gained 12 percent
to $11.2 billion from $10 billion, matching the average of 12
estimates. The company raised prices for its products by 8
percent on average in the period. Sales volumes fell 2 percent,
led by declines in the electronics unit and in the Asia Pacific
region.  To contact the reporters on this story:
