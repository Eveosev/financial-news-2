Canadian natural gas fell after a
report showed U.S. inventories are 58 percent above five-year
norms, paring the need for imports of the fuel.  Alberta  gas slid 1.8 percent. U.S. inventories gained 25
billion cubic feet to 2.512 trillion last week, according to the
Energy Department, in line with the median of 25 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average increase
is 26 billion.  “Canadian imports have been generally below year-ago
levels through mid-April,” said Stephen Smith, an energy
analyst and president of Stephen Smith Energy Associates in
Natchez, Mississippi.  Alberta gas for May delivery fell 2.75 cents to C$1.47 a
gigajoule ($1.40 per million British thermal units) as of 3:10
p.m. New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in  Canada 
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 49 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  declined 4.4 cents to $1.907 per million Btu, the
lowest settlement since September 2001.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago fell
0.8 cent to $2.023 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 2.08 cents to $1.7973 per million Btu. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, prices slipped 2.41 cents to $1.8609.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.4 billion cubic
feet, 416 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.25 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.04 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 1 billion cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.65 billion cubic feet today, or 59 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.97
billion cubic feet at 2:05 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
