General Electric Co. (GE) ’s jet-engine
venture with Safran SA won a $2 billion order to power 78
single-aisle Airbus SAS jets for  Qantas Airways Ltd. (QAN) ’s discount
carrier Jetstar.  The first A320neo carrying the Leap-1A will be delivered in
2016, according to a statement today by the partnership,  CFM
International . The commitment brought total orders for the Leap
family of engines to more than 3,500, the company said.  CFM is competing with United Technologies Corp.’s Pratt &
Whitney to equip the A320neo, which Airbus markets as a more
fuel-efficient version of the world’s best-selling narrow-body
commercial airplane. Both Airbus and rival Boeing Co. are
offering more efficient engines on their single-aisle jets as
 fuel costs  surpass labor to become airlines’ biggest expense.  “The Leap engine was chosen for our new A320neo aircraft
because of its performance,  fuel efficiency  and maintenance
program,” Qantas Chief Executive Officer Alan Joyce said in the
statement.  Boeing’s upgrade of its single-aisle 737 offers only the
CFM engine, while Airbus’s A320 carries Pratt & Whitney’s geared
turbofan as well. Geared turbofan engine sales reached 2,350 at
the end of 2011, the United Technologies told investors and
analysts at a meeting last month.  Fairfield, Connecticut-based  GE’s aviation unit  accounted
for 20 percent, or $18.9 billion, of its $94 billion in
industrial revenue last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
