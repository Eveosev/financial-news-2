Japanese  shares  fell, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average paring gains from its biggest advance
in three weeks yesterday, as investors awaited bond auctions in
 France  and  Spain  after bad loans held by Spanish banks surged.  Nikon Corp., a camera maker that gets more than a fifth of
its sales from Europe, dropped 2 percent in Tokyo. Inpex Corp.,
 Japan ’s No. 1 energy explorer, fell 0.8 percent after crude
prices slid. Nippon Sheet Glass Co. dropped to its lowest since
1976 after saying Chief Executive Officer Craig Naylor quit
following a clash with the board on strategy.  The Nikkei 225 fell 0.8 percent to 9,588.38 at the 3 p.m.
close of trading in Tokyo, paring yesterday’s 2.1 percent
advance. The broader Topix Index slipped 0.6 percent to 814.13,
with all but two of its 33 industry groups falling. Losses were
limited after Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said he’s
“committed” to continuing monetary easing.  “The Nikkei is following a drop in global shares,” said
 Ayako Sera , a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank
Ltd., which has $405 billion in assets. “There’s a good chance
that concern about the banking sector will increase,
particularly in Spain and  Italy . The market will get a lot more
nervous if a fiscal issue leads to a banking issue.”  The benchmark Nikkei 225 has retreated more than 6 percent
since March 27 on renewed concern that Europe’s debt crisis is
spreading and signs  China’s economy  is slowing.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.3 percent
today. The gauge dropped 0.4 percent in  New York  yesterday as
bellwethers  Intel Corp . and International Business Machines Corp.
posted the slowest sales growth in more than two years as the
European slump weighed on orders.  Euro Debt Sales  Shares declined as Spain and France plan to raise as much
as 13.5 billion euros ($17.7 billion) in debt today as Spanish
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s struggles to meet deficit targets
and the French presidential elections drive up yields.  Non-performing loans in Spain as a proportion of total
lending jumped to 8.2 percent in February, the highest level
since 1994, from less than 1 percent in 2007, the Bank of Spain
said yesterday.  Companies that do business in  Europe  retreated. Nikon slid
2 percent to 2,343 yen. Canon, a camera maker that generates 31
percent of its sales in Europe, lost 1.1 percent to 3,780 yen.  Commodity-related stocks dropped after crude for May
delivery slid 1.5 percent yesterday to $102.67, the lowest close
since April 10, and the London Metal Exchange Index of six
industrial commodities fell 0.5 percent. Inpex lost 0.8 percent
to 522,000 yen. Mitsui Mining & Smelting Co. dropped 1.9 percent
to 206 yen.  Nippon Sheet Glass  Nippon Sheet Glass fell to the lowest level in more than
three decades after Naylor resigned because of disagreements
with the board. The stock fell 6.9 percent to 108 yen, the
lowest since April 1976. The departure leaves only three non-
Japanese CEOs at the helm of Nikkei 225 companies.  Losses in shares were limited as  Bank of Japan  Governor
Shirakawa signaled support for more easing. The central bank
will expand asset purchases at a meeting on April 27 after
refraining from introducing new measures earlier this month,
Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co., Mizuho and SMBC Nikko
predict.  “When the market falls, expectations for monetary policy
rise and people speculate the BOJ would act more aggressively,”
said Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment officer of RCM Japan Co.,
which oversees about $138 billion globally. “Most people are
expecting them to do something. If they don’t, the market would
be very disappointed.”  The Nikkei 225 Volatility Index added 2.3 percent to 19.79,
indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.7 percent on the
benchmark equity gauge over the next 30 days. Trading volume
today was 16 percent below the 30-day average.  Shares on the Topix are  valued  at one times book value,
compared with 2.2 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number below one means that investors
can buy companies for less than the value of their assets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
