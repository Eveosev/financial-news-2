The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies rose 1.1 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s Natural Gas Storage Report will show that
inventories gained 26 billion cubic feet in the week ended April
13 to 2.513 trillion cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for May delivery fell 0.5 cent to $1.946 per
million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile
