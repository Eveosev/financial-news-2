The following is the text of
Canada’s employment insurance report for Feb. released
by  Statistics Canada .  The number of beneficiaries fell in six provinces, with the
largest percentage declines occurring in Alberta, Saskatchewan
and Quebec.  Number of Employment Insurance claims down in February  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the number
of people who could become beneficiaries.  Nationally, the number of initial and renewal claims fell
by 5,900 (-2.5%) to 236,100 in February. The largest percentage
decline was observed in Quebec, where claims fell 6.3%. At the
same time, there was little change in the other provinces.  Fewer beneficiaries in most provinces  The number of people receiving regular EI benefits in
February fell in six provinces, with the largest percentage
declines in Alberta (-4.0%), Saskatchewan (-3.8%) and  Quebec 
(-3.4%).  There were also marked declines in Ontario (-2.9%) and  Nova
Scotia  (-2.7%). At the same time, the number of beneficiaries
edged down in New Brunswick, while there was little change in
the other provinces.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  EI data by sub-provincial region, sex and age are not
seasonally adjusted and are therefore compared on a year-over-
year basis.  Year-over-year declines continue in most large centres  Of the 143 large centres, 132 posted declines in the number
of beneficiaries between February 2011 and February 2012. Large
centres are those with a population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of beneficiaries
decreased in all five large centres. In  St.·John’s , the number
of people receiving benefits fell 13.7% to 4,900, continuing a
series of declines that began about two years earlier. There was
also a marked decline in Labrador City.  Both large centres in Prince  Edward Island  had fewer
beneficiaries, with the largest percentage decline in
Charlottetown, where the number of people receiving benefits
fell 16.6% in February. This was the eighth consecutive month of
year-over-year declines.  In Nova Scotia, all five large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12 months to February. The largest
percentage decline occurred in Halifax, where the number of
people receiving benefits fell 17.8% to 6,100. This continued a
series of declines that began nearly two years earlier.  In  New Brunswick , four of the six large centres had fewer
beneficiaries compared with 12 months earlier. The biggest
percentage declines occurred in Moncton, where the number of
beneficiaries fell 7.6%, and in Saint John, where it declined
4.3%.  In Quebec, the number of beneficiaries fell in 28 of the 33
large centres in the 12 months to February, with the largest
percentage declines in Rouyn-Noranda, Amos, Montréal and
Sherbrooke. In Montréal, the number of people receiving benefits
fell 12.6% to 67,100, extending an almost two-year-long series
of declines. In Thetford Mines, the number of beneficiaries
increased 23.6%.  Of the 41 large centres in Ontario, 39 had fewer
beneficiaries in the 12 months to February. The largest
percentage declines occurred in Windsor, Hamilton, Chatham-Kent,
Stratford and Timmins. In Toronto, the number of people
receiving benefits fell 18.8% to 66,600, continuing a two-year-
long trend of year-over-year monthly declines.  In Manitoba, all four large centres had fewer beneficiaries
in February compared with 12 months earlier. In Winnipeg, the
number of people receiving EI benefits fell 5.7% to 7,700,
extending the series of declines that began one year and a half
earlier.  There were fewer beneficiaries in all eight large centres
of Saskatchewan, notably in Moose Jaw, Regina and Saskatoon. In
Regina, the number of beneficiaries fell 17.1% to 1,400,
continuing a series of declines that began in the summer of 2010.
In Saskatoon, 2,100 people received benefits, down 14.8%,
extending the downward trend that started two and a half years
earlier.  In  Alberta , all 12 large centres had fewer beneficiaries in
February compared with 12 months earlier. The largest percentage
declines occurred in  Grande Prairie , Cold Lake and Lethbridge.
In  Edmonton , 9,600 people received benefits, down 36.0%, and in
Calgary, 9,400 people received benefits, down 33.5%. Among all
census metropolitan areas, Calgary and Edmonton had the largest
year-over-year percentage declines for the fourth consecutive
month.  In British Columbia, the number of beneficiaries fell in 24
of the 25 large centres, with the largest percentage declines in
 Powell River  and Squamish. In  Vancouver , 26,900 people received
benefits in February, down 19.9% from February 2011 and
continuing a series of declines that began nearly two years
earlier. In Victoria, the number of beneficiaries was 3,500,
down 18.1% in the 12-month period.  Demographic groups  In February, 463,000 men received regular benefits, down
10.2% from February 2011. The number of beneficiaries fell at a
roughly similar pace for men under 25 (-10.5%) and their
counterparts aged 25 to 54 (-11.2%). Among men aged 55 and over,
the number of people receiving benefits declined 6.7%.  A total of 224,600 women received regular benefits in
February, down 14.0% from 12 months earlier. Among women under
25 and those aged 25 to 54, the number of beneficiaries fell at
a similar rate, 15.4% and 14.9%, respectively. For women aged 55
and over, the decline was 10.3%.  Note to readers  The change in the number of regular Employment Insurance
(EI) beneficiaries reflects various situations, including people
becoming beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources
provided by Service  Canada  and Human Resources and Skills
Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be
affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or
administrative procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries
and the number of claims received for January and February are
preliminary. In this release, large centres correspond to those
with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who
received EI benefits from February 12 to 18. This period
coincides with the reference week of the Labour Force Survey
(LFS).  EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI
benefits, and should not be confused with data coming from the
LFS, which provides information on the total number of
unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people
who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not
contributed to the program because they have not worked in the
past 12 months or their employment is not insured. Other
unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not
meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their
job voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of
work to receive benefits.
