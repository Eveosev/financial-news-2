Japan’s imports of liquefied
natural gas rose to a record last fiscal year as utilities
turned to fossil fuels after the Fukushima nuclear disaster led
to the shutdown of almost all the nation’s atomic reactors.  Japan purchased 83.18 million metric tons of LNG from
overseas in the fiscal year ended March, up 18 percent from the
previous 12 months, the  finance ministry  said in a preliminary
report today. That’s the highest level since the government
started collecting the data in 1980.  The cost of the fuel imports climbed to a record 5.4
trillion yen ($66 billion), compared with 3.5 trillion yen in
fiscal 2010 and the previous high of 4.5 trillion in fiscal
2009, according to the report.  Utilities increased thermal power generation by 26 percent
from a year earlier, data compiled by the Federation of Electric
Power Companies of Japan shows. The average operating rate of
nuclear power plants in the year ended March was 24 percent, a
record low, it said.  The country’s crude-oil imports fell 2.4 percent to 209.85
million kiloliters in the fiscal year, the ministry said. The
cost of the purchases gained 22 percent to 11.9 trillion yen.  The following table shows  Japan ’s imports for the fiscal
year ended March:  To contact the reporters on this story:
