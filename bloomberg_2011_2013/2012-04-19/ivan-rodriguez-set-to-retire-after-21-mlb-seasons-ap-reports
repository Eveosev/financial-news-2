Ivan Rodriguez , a 14-time All-Star
catcher, will announce his retirement April 23, the Associated
Press reported, citing a person familiar with the decision.  Rodriguez, 40, who spent the past two seasons with the
Washington Nationals, will make his announcement in Arlington,
Texas, the AP said. He played the first 12 of his 21 Major
League Baseball seasons with the  Texas Rangers  and returned for
a single season in 2009.  Rodriguez turned down a contract offer from the Kansas City
Royals, who were seeking a replacement for injured catcher
Salvador Perez, AP said.  Rodriguez was selected as the American Leagueâ€™s Most
Valuable Player in 1999 with the Rangers and the National League
Championship Series MVP in 2003 for the  Florida Marlins . He
spent the last two months of the 2008 season with the New York
Yankees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
