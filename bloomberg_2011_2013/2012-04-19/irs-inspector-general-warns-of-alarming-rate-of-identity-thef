Criminals are continuing to file
falsified tax returns using other people’s identities to receive
tax refunds, Russell George, the inspector general for the
 Internal Revenue Service , told a U.S. House of Representatives
subcommittee.  “Unscrupulous individuals are stealing identities at an
alarming rate,” he said today in Washington.  George cited IRS data showing that in 2011, the agency
detected about 940,000 tax returns involving identity theft and
stopped $6.5 billion in refunds from being issued. The total
amount of identity theft is larger than that and unknown.  There is a fundamental tension between the IRS’s goals of
processing tax returns quickly and stopping fraud, said  Nina Olson , the national taxpayer advocate.  “There is no way around these tradeoffs,” said Olson, who
runs an independent taxpayer service department within the IRS.  Steven Miller , deputy commissioner of the IRS, told the
House panel that the agency has made progress on  identity theft .
This year, he said, about 250,000 taxpayers who had identity
theft cases from prior years received personal identification
numbers that authenticate their identity to the IRS.  “We are not done but we have made real progress in the
area,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
