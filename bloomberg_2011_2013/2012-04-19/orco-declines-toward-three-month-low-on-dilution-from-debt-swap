Orco Property Group SA (ORC) , a developer
in central  Europe  overhauling its debt under a court-approved
plan, fell to a three-month low in Czech trading on concern a
plan to exchange bonds for equity will dilute share value.  The stock slipped 2 percent to 84.5 koruna at the close in
Prague, the lowest since Jan. 17, underperforming the PX equity
gauge, which retreated 0.5 percent. In Paris, its home market,
Orco slipped 1.8 percent to 3.37 euros.  Orco reached a preliminary agreement with some bondholders
to convert about 90 percent of its bonds and about 85 percent of
debt issued by its German unit into approximately 91.2 million
shares, the Luxembourg-registered company said yesterday. The
swap would increase the number of outstanding shares to about
108.3 million from 17.1 million, Orco said in the statement.  “The dilution effect will significantly exceed the effect
of the debt reduction,” analysts led by Milan Vanicek at J&T
Banka AS in  Prague  wrote in an e-mailed report to clients today.
