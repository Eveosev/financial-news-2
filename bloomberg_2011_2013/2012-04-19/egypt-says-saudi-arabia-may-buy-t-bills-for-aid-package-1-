Saudi Arabia  will provide  Egypt 
with an aid package that may include a three-year deposit or the
purchase of treasury bills and bonds, according to Egyptian
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri.  Planning and International Cooperation Minister Fayza Aboulnaga said in an interview that the package will include a
$1 billion deposit and $750 million to buy treasury bonds. A
Saudi delegation will visit Egypt to discuss details, she said.  Today’s announcements came after Aboulnaga met Saudi
Finance Minister Ibrahim Al-Assaf at a conference this week in
Morocco. The kingdom has so far given Egypt $500 million out of
almost $4 billion of aid pledged after last year’s popular
revolt that ousted  Hosni Mubarak .  Aboulnaga said she expects the country’s foreign currency
reserves to start increasing in May, the state-run Middle East
News agency reported. Egypt’s net international reserves have
been decreasing since last year’s uprising and are down more
than 50 percent.  Egypt has requested a $3.2 billion loan from the
 International Monetary Fund , part of support sought to boost an
economy that contracted last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
