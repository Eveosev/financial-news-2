Spain â€™s two-year notes pared an
earlier advance as the nation sold 2.54 billion euros of debt at
an auction.  Two-year Spanish note yields were two basis points lower at
3.39 percent at 9:49 a.m. London time, after falling as much as
eight basis points before the auction. Ten-year bond yields
advanced three basis points to 5.85 percent.  Spain sold the two-year securities at an average yield of
3.463 percent. It auctioned the 10-year benchmark bonds at 5.743
percent, compared with 5.403 percent when it last sold them in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
