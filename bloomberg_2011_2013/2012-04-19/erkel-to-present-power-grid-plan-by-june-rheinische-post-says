German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
said her government plans to present legislation for expanding
the country’s power grid by early June, the  Rheinische Post 
reported, citing an interview.  The plan is part of Merkel’s effort to boost the use of
renewable energy, the Dusseldorf-based newspaper said. Merkel
said she can imagine creating a federal energy ministry when
Germany’s nuclear power plants have shut down, according to the
newspaper.
