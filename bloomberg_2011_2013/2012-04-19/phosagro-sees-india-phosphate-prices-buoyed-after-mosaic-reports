OAO Phosagro (PHOR) , the largest maker of
phosphate fertilizers in  Europe , sees Indian prices buoyed this
year after reports U.S. rival  Mosaic Co. (MOS)  is seeking a rate above
a  Florida  benchmark, Chief Executive Officer Maxim Volkov said.  PhosChem, a trader representing Mosaic and Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan, is negotiating Indian prices of as much as $550 a
metric ton, Volkov said on a conference call today, citing
reports by Fertecon Ltd. and researcher FMB Consultants Ltd.  “This is positive and may lead to an upward correction in
prices,” he said. Benchmark rates for diammonium phosphate in
Florida fell as low as $482.50 in February, Bloomberg data show.  Phosagro agreed to sell at least 600,000 tons of phosphate
fertilizers to  India ’s Nagarjuna Group through February 2013 at
a rate linked to prices that will be set by PhosChem in its
negotiations, the Moscow-based producer announced on April 12.  The Russian government has hired BNP Paribas SA to sell the
state’s 20 percent holding in Phosagro’s OAO Apatit unit this
year, Volkov said. The company proposed that the state swap its
Apatit shares into Phosagro equities before selling them into
the market because the parent’s stock is more liquid, he said.  Phosagro scrapped a proposed share buyback to prevent
decreasing the company’s free-float further, Volkov said. A
Mosaic spokesman wasn’t available to comment on negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
