Ethanol in  Chicago  rose the most in
almost three weeks on increased demand for the fuel to be
blended with gasoline.  Prices climbed a day after the Energy Department said
 production of conventional gasoline blended with ethanol , a
measure of consumption beyond what’s mandated by the government,
swelled to a record 5.4 million barrels a day, spurred by the
additive’s discount to the motor fuel.  “You had a really good blending number, which was
surprising,” said Jerrod Kitt, an analyst at Linn Group in
Chicago. “It was really strong. That dollar discount to
gasoline continues to work its magic.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery advanced 4.6 cents, or
2.2 percent, to settle at $2.166 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the biggest one-day gain since March 30. Prices have
dropped 1.7 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  surged 7 cents,
or 3.2 percent, to $2.265 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
jumped 5 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $2.15, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf rose 4.5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
$2.21 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel added 1 cent to
$2.29.  Under a 2007 energy law, the U.S. is required to consume
13.2 billion gallons of renewable fuels such as ethanol this
year, up from 12.6 billion last year.  Gasoline for May delivery slumped 4.86 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $3.1541 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract includes reformulated gasoline, or RBOB,
which is made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to
filling stations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
