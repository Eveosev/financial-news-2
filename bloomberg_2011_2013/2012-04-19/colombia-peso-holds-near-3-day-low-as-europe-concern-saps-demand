Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields on benchmark securities lower for the first time in four
days, as reduced inflation bets boosted the appeal of the fixed-
rate debt.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 7.09 percent, according to the central bank. The
bond’s price rose 0.359 centavo to 123.276 centavos per peso.  “Lower inflation expectations continue to drive gains” in
peso bonds, known as TES, said Juan Camilo Santana, an analyst
at Cia. de Profesionales de Bolsa SA, a brokerage in Bogota.
“Although it’s raining again, people aren’t worried the weather
is going to pressure inflation.”  Colombia’s inflation will end this year at 3.29 percent,
according to the median estimate in a central bank survey
published April 12, down from a projected 3.45 percent expansion
in the March survey. Annual inflation slowed to 3.40 percent in
March, the national statistics agency said in an April 4 report,
less than the 3.63 percent median estimate among economists in a
Bloomberg News survey. Banco de la Republica has an inflation
target of between 2 percent and 4 percent this year.  Rainfall soaking farms in central growing areas this month
probably will last through June, Colombia’s state-run weather
agency said in an April 16 statement. Floods in 2010 and 2011
damaged crops and choked off farmers’ supply routes, pushing
food prices higher.  The peso was little changed at 1,774 per  U.S. dollar . The
peso is up 9.3 percent this year, the best performer among all
currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
