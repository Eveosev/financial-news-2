Egan-Jones Ratings Co. didn’t
knowingly make misrepresentations when applying to become a
nationally recognized credit-rating firm, its founder said.  “The material that we put down was accurate to the best of
our ability,”  Sean Egan , president of the Haverford,
Pennsylvania-based company, said today in an interview on CNBC.
“If we had to do it again today I’d say exactly the same
thing.”  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was poised to
vote today on whether to charge Egan-Jones with intentionally
making misstatements on its application to become a so-called
nationally recognized statistical rating organization, Reuters
reported earlier today citing unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
