Infections of central-line
catheters used to medicate hospital patients have fallen by a
third since the U.S. government set reduction goals in 2009,
said Health and Human Services Secretary  Kathleen Sebelius .  The decrease, part of an initiative to cut such infections
in half by 2013, has saved 1,250 lives and about $82 million in
health spending, Sebelius said at an event today in Washington
hosted by the Atlantic magazine. Reducing the infections to save
money and lives is “low-hanging fruit,” she said.  About one in 20 U.S. hospital patients acquire an infection
during their stays, costing the nation as much as $45 billion a
year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The agency said as many as 70 percent of the cases
could be prevented through steps such as frequent hand-washing
by medical professionals.  While some hospital infections have been reduced in the
past decade, such as those related to antibiotic-resistant staph
bacteria, infections of a germ that causes life-threatening
diarrhea “are at historic highs,” Sebelius’s department said
in a  statement .  The bacterium, called clostridium difficile, kills about
14,000 people a year and costs $1 billion to treat each year.
The government is seeking a 30 percent reduction in the
infections by 2013.  The government also plans to expand its infection-reduction
 initiative  beyond hospitals, to nursing homes, dialysis centers
and clinics, where about 75 percent of clostridium difficile
infections are contracted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
