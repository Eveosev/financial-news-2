Kazkommertsbank,  Kazakhstan ’s
second-largest lender by assets, plans to issue at least $1.5
billion of new loans this year, Chief Executive Officer Nina
Zhussupova told reporters in Almaty today.  The bank forecasts from $100 million to $150 million in
monthly repayments by corporate clients and expects to lend the
redeemed funds, Zhussupova said. Kazkommertsbank will probably
extend $360 million to $380 million of new retail loans, Andrei
Timchenko, a managing director at the lender, said today.  Kazkommertsbank increased profit 7 percent last year to
23.5 billion tenge ($159 million), and plans to increase profit
by as much as 10 percent this year, according to a presentation
yesterday. The Kazakh lender, in which the sovereign wealth fund
Samruk-Kazyna holds a 21 percent voting stake, said gross loans
will probably remain little changed this year, after shrinking
0.3 percent last year.  Borrowing abroad will be “unreasonably expensive” abroad
now, while  interest rates  for deposits as well as loans are
quite low in Kazakhstan, Zhussupova said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
