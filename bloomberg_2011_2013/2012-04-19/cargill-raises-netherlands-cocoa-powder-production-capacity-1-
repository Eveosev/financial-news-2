Cargill Inc. increased the cocoa
powder production capacity at its plant in Wormer, the
Netherlands, following an $82 million investment.  Works to upgrade the Dutch processing plant are now
complete,  Minneapolis , Minnesota-based Cargill said in a
statement e-mailed today. The company did not state the new
capacity.  Cocoa powder output capacity was increased in “response to
growing customer demand for high quality cocoa powders,”
according to the statement. The Wormer facility processes cocoa
liquor into cocoa butter and powder, the company said.  Cargill’s investment also included a cocoa powder warehouse
and distribution center in the port of Amsterdam, the company
said. The warehouse will store three times as much product per
square metre (3.28 feet) as conventional warehouses in the port,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
