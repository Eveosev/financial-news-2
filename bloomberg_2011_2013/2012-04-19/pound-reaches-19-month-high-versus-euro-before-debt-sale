The pound strengthened to the
highest in more than 19 months against the euro for a second day
on speculation the  Bank of England  will pause its stimulus
program next month amid signs the U.K. economy is improving.  Sterling slipped from the strongest level in five months
versus the dollar. Minutes of the Bank of England’s latest
meeting released yesterday showed officials said inflation may
be quicker than previously forecast. The Monetary Policy
Committee agreed on April 4-5 to keep its target for so-called
quantitative easing at 325 billion pounds ($521 billion).
Benchmark 10-year gilts fell for a third day as the U.K. sold
index-linked bonds maturing in March 2029 at a negative yield.  “There’s still a bit of a half-life occurring from the
Bank of England minutes yesterday,” said Lauren Rosborough, a
senior foreign-exchange strategist at Societe Generale SA in
 London . “It’s taking away the probability of further QE any
time soon. I expect sterling to outperform for the next three to
four months.”  The pound appreciated 0.1 percent to 81.82 pence per euro
at 4:42 p.m. London time after touching 81.62 pence, the
strongest level since Aug. 26, 2010. The U.K. currency climbed
0.2 percent to $1.6053. It reached $1.6079, the highest since
Nov. 14.  Sterling has risen 1.6 percent in the past month, the
second-biggest gain of the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen was
the best performer, gaining 2.9 percent, while the dollar rose
0.4 percent.  Growth Signs  U.K. reports over the past week showed consumer-price
inflation unexpectedly accelerated for the first time in six
months in March, and asking prices for U.K. homes increased to a
record this month.  The Bank of England minutes showed policy maker  Adam Posen 
ended his push for further stimulus, bringing him in line with
the majority of the nine-member Monetary Policy Committee in
seeking no change to the asset-purchase target.  The central bank’s position contrasts with the U.S. and
 Japan  where policy makers have indicated they are considering
further stimulus.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said
yesterday that the bank is “committed” to monetary easing,
while Federal Reserve Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  on April 11
endorsed the Fed’s view that borrowing costs are likely to stay
low through 2014.  The 10-year gilt yield climbed two basis points to 2.16
percent. The 4 percent security due March 2022 fell 0.230, or
2.30 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount to 116.325.  The Debt Management Office sold 1.35 billion pounds of
inflation-linked bonds due in March 2029. The securities were
auctioned at an average yield of minus 0.045 percent, compared
with minus 0.188 percent at the previous sale on Feb. 2.  The Debt Management Office will sell as much as 3 billion
pounds of bills tomorrow.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 1.9 percent in the first
quarter, the worst start to a year since 1996, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch indexes. They have returned 0.5 percent
this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
