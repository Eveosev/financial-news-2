A precocious pre-teenager with
special powers is the flavor of the week in  London .  “Matilda the Musical,” the story of a little girl who
triumphs over her tacky parents and heartless headmistress,
snagged a record seven Laurence Olivier awards last weekend, the
London stage’s highest accolades.  The four girls alternating as Matilda shared the trophy for
best actress in a musical. There’s plenty of time to see at
least one of them in action: The production is on through
February 2013 and then transfers to Broadway.  Information:  http://www.matildathemusical.com  or
+44-844-800-1110.  If you’d rather watch a Cuban dance prodigy do perilous
jumps, Carlos Acosta returns to “La Fille Mal Gardee” at the
Royal Opera House. It’s the story of a loved-up couple who are
set to live happily ever after when the girl’s mom butts in,
insisting she can do better.  The ballet ends its run on May 16. Acosta performs again on
April 26. Information:  http://www.roh.org.uk  or +44-20-7240-
1200.  Saturday  A curious kind of Chinese collector is in the spotlight at
the Barbican Gallery.  Artist Song Dong’s late mother never threw anything away.
Over 50 frugal years, she stashed more than 10,000 household
items that are now on display in an exhibition. Squeezed tubes
of toothpaste, old bras, faded doormats, and empty Coke cans,
once her everyday things, now serve as moving reminders of a
lapsed life.  Song Dong originally put the show together with his mother,
whose collecting habit got worse when her husband died. Ever
since her own death in 2009, Song Dong has been remaking the
show with his sister and wife. You never know, those half-used
soap bars could come in handy one day.  “Song Dong: Waste Not” is at the Barbican Gallery through
June 12. Information:  http://www.barbican.org.uk  or +44-20-7638-
4141.  Chiswell Street Dining Rooms is a good place to visit
before or after a performance at the Barbican. There’s a bar
with cocktails as well as beers from microbrewers, while the
restaurant serves modern British food. Information:

concert to help the War Child charity.  The electronics duo, best known for “Leftism” in 1995,
will be reprising its hits which include “Open Up” and
“Afrika Shox.”  Brixton O2 Academy, 211 Stockwell Road, SW9 9SL.

Coldharbour Lane is worth a visit. It’s happy hour for cocktails
every day between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., while the late-dining menu
is available until midnight on Saturdays. Information:

Print Fair, held inside the  Royal Academy  of Arts.  The prints are priced between 30,000 pounds ($47,920) and
40,000 pounds with the Picassos at the upper end of the range.  If you like that sort of thing, Queen Elizabeth II’s 60th-
anniversary Jubilee is one of the themes at the fair this year.  The fair runs through April 22 at the Royal Academy.

of  Australia ’s indigenous tongues -- at the Globe Theatre.  The event is free, and there’s an international food
market, too. It’s a preamble to the six-week Globe to Globe
Festival, where all 37 of the Bard’s plays will be performed in
37 languages.  Information:  http://www.shakespearesglobe.com  or +44-29-
