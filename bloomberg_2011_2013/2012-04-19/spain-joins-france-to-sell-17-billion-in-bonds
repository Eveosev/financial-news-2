France  sold 8 billion euros ($10.5
billion) in debt today as risks linked to the French
presidential election drove up yields.  The amount sold was at the maximum target set by Agence
France Tresor, the country’s debt-management body. France sold
2.7 billion euros of benchmark five-year debt at an average
yield of 1.83 percent, up from 1.78 percent on March 15.  Earlier today, Spain sold 2.54 billion euros in two- and
10-year bonds, slightly more than the maximum target of 2.5
billion euros. Borrowing costs rose as Spanish Prime Minister
 Mariano Rajoy ’s struggles to meet deficit targets.  Scrutiny of both countries is increasing amid the fading
effect of the  European Central Bank ’s longer-term refinancing
operation, which injected about 1 trillion euros of liquidity
into the region’s financial system. The yield on  Spain ’s
benchmark 10-year bond has jumped about 1 percentage point since
the beginning of March to above 6 percent, while the yield on
the equivalent French debt has gained more than 10 basis points
with Socialist Francois Hollande leading in election polls.  French voters choose between 10 presidential candidates
three days from now and face a choice between the two leading
contenders in a second round scheduled for May 6. Socialist
candidate Hollande has consistently led President  Nicolas Sarkozy  in polls for the decisive final ballot.  While Hollande has pledged to meet the  deficit reduction 
targets put in place by the current government, his plan
forecasts a balanced budget in 2017, a year after Sarkozy. He
has suggested raising the minimum wage and promised to tax
personal earnings of more than 1 million euros at a rate of 75
percent. The proposals have raised concern that he may not be
committed to improving France’s competitiveness.  France sold 3.55 billion euros of bonds maturing in
September 2014, 1.73 billion euros maturing in April 2015 and
2.7 billion euros maturing in February 2017. In addition, it
plans to sell as much 3 billion euros in inflation-linked
securities maturing in July 2018 later today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
