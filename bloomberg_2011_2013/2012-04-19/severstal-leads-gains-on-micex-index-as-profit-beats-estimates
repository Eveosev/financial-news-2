OAO Severstal led gains on Russia’s
benchmark stock gauge after billionaire Alexey Mordashov’s
steelmaker said fourth-quarter profit rose 7.9 percent from the
previous three months, beating analyst estimates.  The shares jumped 1.1 percent to 384.60 rubles as of 10:13
a.m. in Moscow, heading for their strongest gain since April 5.
The 30-stock Micex Index traded up 0.3 percent at 1,472.77.  Net income climbed to $463 million from $429 million in the
third quarter, the steelmaker said today in a regulatory filing.
This compares with the average estimate of $390 million profit
from eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales fell 18 percent
to $3.73 billion on lower prices and volumes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
