Quarterback Andrew Luck has been
told by the  Indianapolis Colts  that he’ll be the first player
selected in the National Football League draft, ESPN reported.  It’s unclear when Luck, who led Stanford University to an
11-2 record last season, was told of the team’s decision. The
Colts settled on taking Luck over Baylor quarterback Robert Griffin III weeks ago,  ESPN said , citing an unidentified NFL
official.  The Colts cut quarterback  Peyton Manning  in March rather
than pay the four-time NFL Most Valuable Player a $28 million
bonus after missing the entire 2011 season following neck
surgery.  Luck returned to Stanford last season even though he was
projected as the top draft pick. He completed 71.3 percent of
his passes for the Cardinal during the 2011 campaign, throwing
for 37 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.  The Colts went 2-14 last season to get the top pick in the
draft, which runs April 26-28. It’s their first time holding
that draft position since selecting Manning No. 1 in 1998.  The  Washington Redskins  will select Griffin No. 2, ESPN
said, citing unidentified league sources.  To contact the reporter on this story:
