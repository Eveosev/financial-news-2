Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI)  rejected
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s $13-a-share takeover offer partly because
most of its biggest investors bought the stock at a higher
average price, said two people with knowledge of the matter.  Of the 25 largest  shareholders , about 22 of them acquired
stakes with an average basis price that’s higher than the offer,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
discussions are private. Starting in late 2009,  Human Genome 
shares traded between $20 and $30 until about August of 2011.  Glaxo first learned of Human Genome’s rejection of the
$2.59 billion offer through a phone call earlier today, another
person familiar with the situation said. Human Genome Chief
Executive Officer Thomas Watkins called Glaxo CEO  Andrew Witty 
at about 5 a.m. New York time, saying that the offer didn’t
reflect Human Genome’s value and that the company would be
making a public statement shortly, the person said. The
statement was released at 5:12 a.m.  Human Genome first learned of Glaxo’s interest in an April
11 letter, two people said. The Rockville, Maryland-based
company told Glaxo it was willing to discuss a sale at a higher
price, said two people. Late last week, Human Genome decided to
go public with the offer and put itself up for sale,
anticipating interest from larger pharmaceutical companies, the
people said.  A spokeswoman for London-based Glaxo and a spokesman for
Human Genome declined to comment beyond the company’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
