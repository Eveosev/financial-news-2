The Muslim Brotherhood’s political
arm criticized a visit to  Jerusalem  by a top Egyptian cleric,
Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa.  “It is not acceptable for such a visit to take place after
the revolution, when both official and popular positions reject
having any relations with the Israeli entity as long as
occupation, settlements and the siege of Gaza continue,” the
Freedom and Justice Party, which dominates  Egypt ’s first elected
parliament since the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak , said in
a statement.  Gomaa’s visit with a Jordanian delegation yesterday was
unofficial and he didn’t receive an entry visa from Israel,
Egypt’s state-run Middle East News Agency said yesterday, citing
Ibrahim Negm, the mufti’s media adviser. The trip was made in
solidarity with the Palestinians and to show that  Israel  can’t
stop Arabs and Muslims from going to the city’s Al-Aqsa mosque,
it cited Negm as saying.  While Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979, some
Egyptians oppose having normal ties with Israel, including
cultural and business dealings. A survey published last year by
the Pew Research Center’s Global Attitudes Project found that 54
percent of 1,000 Egyptians surveyed want the government to end
the treaty.  Israel annexed east Jerusalem, a territory captured in the
1967 war, in a move that was never internationally recognized.
Palestinians see the area as the capital of a future state.  To contact the reporter on this story:
