Asia Broadcast Satellite is seeking
a loan of about $215 million from the Export-Import Bank of the
 United States  and HSBC Holdings Plc is advising on the
financing, according to two people familiar with the matter.  Proceeds will be used to fund the purchase of a satellite
from  Loral Space & Communications Inc. (LORL)  and two from  Boeing Co. (BA) ,
the people said, asking not to be identified because the details
are private. ING Groep NV has also been retained by Hong Kong-
based Asia Broadcast in a consultancy role for part of the
funding, one of the people said.  Asia Broadcast Satellite’s Singapore-based spokeswoman,
Penny Hill, didn’t immediately respond to questions about the
deal when contacted by e-mail and telephone today.  Boeing said last month it had been  awarded  a contract for
four satellites from Asia Broadcast and Satelites Mexicanos SA
de CV. The first two satellites, ABS-3A for Asia Broadcast, and
Satmex 7 for Satelites Mexicanos, are scheduled to be delivered
together in late 2014 or early 2015, according to a March 13
media release.  The export credit agency loan is expected to have a
maturity of at least eight years and financing will probably be
in place by about the third quarter of 2012, one of the people
said today.  Asia Broadcast is a global satellite operator which is
expanding its fleet to serve the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian
ocean regions. Since the acquisition of its first satellite in
2006, the group has grown to operate four satellites in orbit,
according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
