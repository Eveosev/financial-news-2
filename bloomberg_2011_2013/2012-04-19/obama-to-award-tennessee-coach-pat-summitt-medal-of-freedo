President  Barack Obama  will award a
Presidential Medal of Freedom to Pat Summitt, who is stepping
down as the winningest basketball coach in the NCAA, eight
months after her diagnosis of early onset dementia.  Obama, in a statement today announcing Summitt will receive
the nation’s highest civilian honor, called her an inspiration
both because of her coaching record and her willingness “to
speak so openly and courageously about her battle with
Alzheimer’s” disease.  Summitt was notified last week of Obama’s decision.  Summitt, 59, announced yesterday she is stepping aside as
head coach of the University of Tennessee women’s basketball
team. She won eight national championships and a college
basketball-record 1,098 games in 38 seasons at  Tennessee . She
retains the title of head coach emeritus and will assist the
coaching staff, help with on-campus recruiting and serve as a
mentor to players.  Summitt said in August that she had been diagnosed last
year by doctors with early onset dementia, Alzheimer’s type.  She said she’ll continue her role as a spokeswoman in the
fight against Alzheimer’s through the Pat Summitt Foundation
Fund, while remaining close to the Tennessee women’s basketball
program in her new role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
