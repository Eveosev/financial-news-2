Gentex Corp. (GNTX)  dropped as much as 11
percent after forecasting a sales gain this quarter that was
lower than analysts estimated.  Gentex fell 9.5 percent to $23 at 10:56 a.m. New York time,
after reaching $22.73, the lowest intraday level since Oct. 4.
The shares declined 14 percent this year through yesterday after
rising 0.1 percent in 2011.  Second-quarter sales will rise about 15 percent, Chief
Financial Officer Steve Dykman said in a statement today. The
average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for
a gain of 19 percent to $288 million from a year earlier.  The company’s second-quarter forecast “looks a little
light,”  Peter Nesvold , a New York-based analyst for Jefferies &
Co., wrote in a report.  Gentex. based in Zeeland,  Michigan , makes rear- and side-
view mirrors that include camera displays. It competes against
 Magna International Inc. (MG) , an Aurora, Ontario-based maker of
similar mirrors and cameras.  The company reported first-quarter net income of $46.3
million on revenue of $290.7 million, both records. That
compares to a year-ago profit of $42.3 million on revenue of
$250.9 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
