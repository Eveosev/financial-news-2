Investing in  natural gas  today is
similar to buying gold in 1997, before a surge in the precious
metal’s price, according to Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive
officer of DoubleLine Capital LP.  The CHART OF THE DAY illustrates his analogy, made on a
conference call two days ago. The chart compares gas-futures
prices on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  with the price of
gold for immediate delivery 15 years earlier.  Gundlach, whose Los Angeles-based firm runs mutual funds
with $25 billion of assets, said on the call that he’s adding
gas-related holdings to the DoubleLine Multi-Asset Growth Fund.
His remarks were reported by the Business Insider and Pragmatic
Capitalist blogs. A recording was unavailable yesterday pending
a compliance review, according to Talkpoint.com, which hosted
the call.  The fund had no more that 4.5 percent of assets in gas and
other energy-related commodities as of March 31, according to
data posted on the DoubleLine  website .  Hugoton Royalty Trust (HGT)  and
 San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (SJT) , which own stakes in oil and gas
properties, were among its holdings.  Natural gas fell below $2 per million British thermal units
this month on the Nymex for the first time in a decade.
Production increases from U.S. shale formations contributed to
the decline. For the year, gas has lost 35 percent.  As 1997 ended, spot gold traded at its lowest price since
1979. The precious metal retreated 21 percent for the year and
posted losses in each of the next three years. Since then, the
price has risen sixfold, aided by an 11-year winning streak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
