Oil options volatility was little
changed as the underlying futures fell after more Americans than
expected filed for  unemployment benefits  and sales of existing
homes declined.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 25.62 as of 3 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , versus 25.74 yesterday.  Crude oil for May delivery fell 40 cents to settle at
$102.27 a barrel on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Crude
since April 4 has traded in a range of $100.68 to $105.07.  “The market is dilly-dallying here on lack of news to move
it much,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in New York. “And you’ve got a tight range
again.”  Crude for June delivery declined 40 cents to $102.72. May
futures expire tomorrow.  The most-active oil options in electronic trading today
were June $90 puts, which gained 1 cent to 25 cents a barrel at
2:44 p.m. with 3,202 contracts trading. June $95 puts were the
second-most active with 2,159 lots changing hands. They rose 2
cents to 72 cents.  Puts accounted for 59 percent of electronic trading volume.
