Finland’s government proposed an
overhaul of securities markets legislation to add clarity, ease
supervision and trim the administrative burden on companies, the
 Finance Ministry  said in a  statement  today.  The parliament still needs to approve the proposal and the
laws are scheduled to come into force on July 1. The government
will send a proposal on the possible indirect holding of assets
to parliament by the end of May, the ministry in Helsinki said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
