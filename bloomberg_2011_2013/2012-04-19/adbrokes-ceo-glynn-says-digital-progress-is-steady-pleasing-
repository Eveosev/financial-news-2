(Corrects to make clear in last paragraph that amount is
not revenue.)  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  Chief Executive
Officer Richard Glynn said the company is making progress in its
digital offering and revenue from the division will probably
pick up in the second-half.  “We have an awful lot more to do, but its steady, pleasing
progress,” Glynn said on a conference call with reporters
today. “We are having to invest heavily. You will see the
revenue uptick in the second-half of this year.”  The 2012 UEFA European Football Championship may generate
about 300 million pounds ($482 million) in additional amounts
staked for the industry, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
