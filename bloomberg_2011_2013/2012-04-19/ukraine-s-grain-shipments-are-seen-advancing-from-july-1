Ukraine’s grain exports will rise
to 22 million to 24 million metric tons in the marketing year
that starts July 1 from 19 million to 20 million tons in the
current season, according to UkrAgroConsult.  Corn shipments will rise to 14 million to 15 million tons
in the year after July 1 from 12.5 million tons in the current
season, Serhiy Feofilov, head of the Kiev-based researcher, said
today at a conference in the Ukrainian capital.  Wheat exports will be between 5 million and 6 million tons,
compared with 4 million to 5 million, Feofilov said. Carryover
stocks of wheat will be a record 7 million to 8 million tons as
of July 1, compared with 3.6 million tons a year earlier,
according to the analyst.  The sunflower crop will rise to 9.5 million tons from 9.3
million tons in the year-earlier period, Feofilov said at a
conference. The harvest may reach 10 million tons if weather
conditions are favorable.  Sunflower oil exports will rise in the marketing year from
Sept. 1 to 3.25 million tons from 3.1 million tons in the
current year ending Aug. 31, Feofilov said. Soybean exports will
rise to 1.55 million tons from 1.4 million tons, according to
the analyst.  Ukraine will harvest 46 million to 47 million tons of grain
in 2012, Feofilov said, adding that chances of the government
limiting shipments are “low,” at least until Jan. 1 next year.  UkroAgroConsult estimated the 2011 grain harvest at 50
million tons, less than the state statistics office’s figure of
56.7 million tons.  To contact the reporters on this story:
