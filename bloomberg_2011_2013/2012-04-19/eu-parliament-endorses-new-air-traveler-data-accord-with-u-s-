The  European Parliament  approved an
agreement on the transfer of airline-passenger information to
the U.S. to guard against the threat of terrorism.  The European Union assembly endorsed a seven-year accord
enabling airlines in  Europe  to give the U.S. Department of
Homeland Security data about trans-Atlantic travelers without
violating EU privacy rules. The 19 pieces of information, known
as the “passenger name record,” include the seat number,
reservation date, payment method and travel itinerary.  The  deal  given the green light today in Strasbourg,  France ,
will let the U.S. government keep the information on each
traveler for as long as 15 years. After that, data retained must
be “fully anonymized” by deleting all information that could
serve to identify a passenger.  The accord will replace one that has been in force
provisionally since 2007. The absence of an agreement would
leave airlines such as  Air France-KLM Group (AF)  and  Deutsche
Lufthansa AG (LHA)  in legal limbo, potentially forcing them to choose
between violating EU or U.S. law.  The 2007 agreement was a revised version of an initial 2004
accord that the EU high court struck down because the
information-transfer system was based on European economic
rather than anti-terror legislation. All the agreements stem
from U.S. efforts to fight terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
