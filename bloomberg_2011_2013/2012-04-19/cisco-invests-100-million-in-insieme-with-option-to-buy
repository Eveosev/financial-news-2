Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) , the world’s
biggest maker of computer-networking equipment, invested $100
million in Insieme, a networking startup, securing the option
for a buyout, as it seeks to boost a turnaround with new product
offerings.  An acquisition of Insieme, a company focused on research
and development in the datacenter market, for an additional $750
million, would be a so-called spin-in as the startup was created
with Cisco funding, the company said in a memo sent to employees
on April 17 and obtained by Bloomberg News.  “Insieme’s product development efforts are complementary
to that of Cisco’s current and planned internal investments,”
 San Jose , California-based Cisco said in the memo. “These types
of investments have strongly benefited Cisco in the past, and we
will continue to look for similar ways to complement our
internal development capabilities.”  Cisco, which has pledged to seek technology acquisitions
and add more profitable products as part of a turnaround plan,
agreed to buy NDS Group Ltd. for about $5 billion last month to
tap demand for next-generation video services. The investment in
Insieme signals Cisco’s efforts to deepen expertise in a new
area of computer networking where software handles the tasks
typically done by more expensive networking hardware.  Insieme was founded by three Cisco employees, Mario Mazzola, Luca Cafiero and Prem Jain in January, who together
have previously sold two companies to Cisco.  The investment was earlier reported by the New York Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
