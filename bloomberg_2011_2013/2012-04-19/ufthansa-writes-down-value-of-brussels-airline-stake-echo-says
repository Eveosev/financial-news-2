Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  has reduced
the value of its stake in Brussels Airlines by 13 million euros
($17 million) because of poor results and a difficult economic
environment,  L’Echo  reported.  The writedown of Lufthansa’s 45 percent holding is a
“small reduction,” the newspaper quoted Lufthansa spokesperson
Aage Duenhaupt as saying. Brussels Airlines will now strive to
reduce the 30 million euros in losses it expects for 2012 and to
return to profitability in 2013, L’Echo said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
