UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank,
plans to invest 150 million Swiss francs ($164 million) over a
decade in education projects aimed at different age groups,
Chief Executive Officer  Sergio Ermotti  said.  The bank, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this
year, would profit from “clever heads” as would the financial
center and Switzerland, Ermotti said at an event in Zurich
today.  As part of the education initiative, the firm will finance
the creation of the UBS International Center of Economics in
Society at the University of Zurich. The center will conduct
research into topics related to economics and financial markets,
as well as promote practical application of its findings, the
bank said.  The Zurich-based company will also support educational
projects for primary and high-school students, create additional
apprenticeship and internship positions, support entrepreneurs
and jobseekers over the age of 50.  “This is an investment in the only resource of our
resource-poor country -- in the ‘grey cells,’” Chairman  Kaspar Villiger  said. “Because of the relentless competition between
countries in a globalized world, we can only preserve our
prosperity if we’re among the best. Conditions especially for
the financial industry have become tougher; I’m thinking about
the erosion of banking secrecy, stricter regulation, political
headwinds and the difficult market environment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
