Mortgage rates  in the U.S. rose for
the first time in four weeks, increasing borrowing costs as
demand for housing is slow to recover.  The average rate for a 30-year mortgage climbed to 3.9
percent in the week ended today from 3.88 percent,  Freddie Mac 
said in a statement. The average 15-year rate rose to 3.13
percent from 3.11 percent, the lowest in the McLean, Virginia-
based mortgage-finance company’s records.  While the housing market is improving by some measures,
weak job growth and stricter lending standards are weighing on a
recovery. Sales of previously owned U.S.  homes  fell in March for
the third time in the last four months, declining 2.6 percent
from February to a 4.48 million annual rate, the National
Association of Realtors reported today.  “We are in the very early stages of a recovery,”  Patrick Newport , an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington,
 Massachusetts , said in a telephone interview yesterday. “For
the single-family market, we can barely call it a recovery.
Activity is increasing but just very slowly.”  Homeowners are taking advantage of low borrowing costs to
reduce their monthly payments. The  Mortgage Bankers
Association ’s index of  refinancing  applications surged 14
percent in the period ended April 13, the Washington-based group
reported yesterday. The  purchasing  gauge fell 11 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
