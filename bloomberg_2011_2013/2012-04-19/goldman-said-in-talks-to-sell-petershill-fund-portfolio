Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  is in
talks with a  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  unit to sell its Petershill
fund that buys stakes in hedge funds, according to two people
familiar with the matter.  The negotiations with New York-based Asset Management
Finance LLC haven’t yet led to an agreement and the talks may
still fall apart, said the people who asked not to be identified
because the information is private.  Brian Finn, chief executive officer of Asset Management
Finance, didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment on the
talks, which were reported by the New York Times yesterday.  Petershill was started in 2007 and bought stakes of between
8 percent and 9 percent in hedge funds, including Winton Capital
Management Ltd. and Capula Investment Management LLP in  London .
The Goldman fund, which was previously run by Jonathan Sorrell,
also invested in Level Global Investors LP, which liquidated
after being raided by the FBI in 2010, and Shumway Capital
Partners LLC, which closed last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
