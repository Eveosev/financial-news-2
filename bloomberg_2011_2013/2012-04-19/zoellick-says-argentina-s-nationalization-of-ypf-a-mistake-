Argentina’s decision to nationalize
oil producer  YPF SA (YPFD)  was a “mistake” and the “wrong thing to
do,” outgoing World Bank President Robert Zoellick said.  Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner on April
16 announced plans to seize a 51 percent stake in YPF from
Spain’s Repsol-YPF SA. The expropriation follows the takeovers
of airline Aerolineas Argentinas SA and a $24 billion in pension
funds by Fernandez since she took office in 2007.  Zoellick, whose term ends June 30, also said the Eurozone
is going to be “walking a very fine line” and the region’s
banking system “remains under significant stress.”  Jim Yong Kim, the candidate nominated by the U.S., was
selected April 16 to head the  World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
