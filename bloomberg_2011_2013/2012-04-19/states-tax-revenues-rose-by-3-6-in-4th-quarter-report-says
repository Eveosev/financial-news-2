States’ tax collections grew for
the eighth straight quarter at the end of 2011, for the first
time topping peak revenue levels seen at the start of the most
recent recession, according to the Rockefeller Institute of
Government and Census Bureau data.   States’ tax revenues rose by 3.6 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2011, compared with a year ago. The gains were 3
percent and 7.4 percent higher than the comparable quarters of
2007 and 2008, respectively, the institute said in a statement
about its report.  Tax collections in 17 states were lower in the final
quarter of 2011 than they were four years earlier, the
statement said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
