Grain-growing regions in  Australia ,
the second-biggest wheat exporter, may receive rain in the next
week, boosting soil moisture as farmers prepare to sow crops.  Most of eastern New South Wales and Victoria may get 15
millimeters (0.6 inches) to 25 millimeters in the eight days to
April 26, according to a  model  on the Bureau of Meteorology’s
website. Some regions may get 50 millimeters, it shows. Western
Australia’s main grain-growing region may get as much as 10
millimeters, the bureau said.  Growers need rain to plant winter crops including wheat,
barley and canola. The nation’s wheat output may drop 13 percent
to 25.7 million metric tons this year as farmers switch to
barley and canola on better returns, the Australian Bureau of
Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences said March 6.  “Rainfall promises favorable conditions for winter-crop
seeding across the eastern states,”  Luke Mathews , a commodity
strategist at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia , wrote in a note
today. Western Australia’s grain belt may receive timely and
favorable rain, he wrote, citing a four-week forecast.  Wheat has lost 5.1 percent in  Chicago  this year as concern
eased that drought in the U.S. and  Europe  may damage crops,
while canola on ICE Futures Canada has climbed 8.3 percent.  Rain associated with a La Nina weather pattern helped boost
Australia’s wheat output to a record last harvest, while wet
weather this year has increased soil moisture ahead of planting
that begins in late-April to early-May.  To contact the reporter for this story:
