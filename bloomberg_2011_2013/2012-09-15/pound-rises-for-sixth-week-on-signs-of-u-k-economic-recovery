The pound rose for a sixth week
versus the dollar, sending it to a four-month high, on signs the
economy is emerging from recession and after the  Federal Reserve 
announced another round of stimulus measures.  Sterling matched the longest run of weekly gains since July
2007 as reports showed the U.K. trade deficit shrank in July as
exports soared and unemployment fell the most in more than two
years. The  Dollar Index  slid to the lowest since May after the
Fed announced Sept. 13 a third series of asset purchases, known
as quantitative easing, to boost the economy. Gilts fell for a
second week amid increased bets for faster inflation, pushing
10-year U.K. yields to the highest level in four months.  “Sterling is being helped by a broad dollar selloff after
the Fed announced open-ended QE,” said  Chris Turner , head of
foreign-exchange strategy at ING Groep NV in  London . “The U.K.
data we have seen can’t be bad for the currency, with
expectations for the economy to have pulled out of recession in
the third quarter. You can’t rule out a move to $1.65 now.”  Sterling rose 1.4 percent in the week to $1.6241 at 5:02
p.m. London time yesterday, after climbing to $1.6256, the
highest level since April 30. The pound dropped 1 percent to
80.88 pence per euro after touching 81.15 pence, the weakest
since June 15.  The pound has appreciated 0.4 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 3.5 percent and
the euro rose 3.7 percent.  Unlimited Purchases  The dollar depreciated after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
announced the central bank’s third round of large-scale asset
purchases since 2008, with the difference that it didn’t set any
limit on the ultimate amount it would buy or the duration of the
program. Instead, stimulus will be expanded until the Fed sees
“sustained improvement” in the labor market.  U.K. government bonds fell before a report next week that
economists in a Bloomberg survey said will show inflation rose
0.5 percent last month versus a 0.1 percent increase in July.
Minutes from this month’s Bank of England policy meeting are
also due. The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, led by
Governor  Mervyn King , left the bank’s main interest rate at a
record low 0.5 percent and maintained its asset-purchase target
at 375 billion pounds on Sept. 6.  Ten-year gilt  yields climbed 28 basis points in the week,
or 0.28 percentage point, to 1.97 percent, the highest since May
10. The 1.75 percent bond maturing in September 2022 fell 2.54,
or 25.4 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 98.06.  The U.K. Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell 4.5
billion pounds of five-year gilts on Sept. 20.  Gilts have returned 2.5 percent this year through Sept. 13,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds also
gained 2.5 percent and  U.S. Treasuries  earned 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
