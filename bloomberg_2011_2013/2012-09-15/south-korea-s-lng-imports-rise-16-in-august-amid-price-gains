South Korean imports of liquefied
natural gas rose 16 percent from a year earlier in August amid
increases in the price paid for the fuel.  The world’s second-biggest LNG buyer purchased 2.35 million
metric tons of the cleaner-burning fuel last month, compared
with 2.02 million tons a year earlier, data on the Korea Customs
Service’s  website  showed today. Imports declined from the 2.75
million tons purchased in July.  Costs for the fuel climbed 11 percent to $1.9 billion in
August, an average of $807.30 a ton, compared with $1.47
billion, or $725.50 a ton, a year earlier, the data showed.  South Korea buys most of its LNG under multiyear contracts
from suppliers including Qatar, Indonesia and Oman. Last month’s
purchases included 115,920 tons bought on the  spot market  for
about $684.60 a ton from Nigeria and  Trinidad and Tobago ,
today’s data showed.  State-run  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest LNG buyer,
said on Sept. 11 that August sales rose 16 percent from a year
earlier to 2.13 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
