European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said it may make sense to
reconsider the ECB’s policy of granting all council members an
equal say, according to an interview in  Austria ’s  Profil 
magazine.  “One can see it as not unproblematic that each governor
has the same vote,” Nowotny, who also heads the Austrian
central bank, said in the interview published today.  “At the  International Monetary Fund , it is different.
There, the votes are weighted according to capital share,” he
was quoted as saying.  “I believe -- even as a citizen of a small country -- that
it helps stability to consider different economic strengths,
especially when it comes to economic questions,” Nowotny said,
according to Profil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
