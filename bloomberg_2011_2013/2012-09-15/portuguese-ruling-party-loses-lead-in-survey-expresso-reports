The ruling  Social Democratic Party 
of Portuguese Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  lost its lead
over the opposition Socialist Party in a survey of voters’
intentions, Expresso reported.  The survey indicated 33 percent backing from  voters  for the
Social Democrats, 1.1 percentage point less than in a poll
published in August, the Portuguese weekly newspaper said. The
survey indicated 33.7 percent support for the Socialists, an
increase of 0.7 percentage point, Expresso said.  The survey also indicated 10.3 percent support for the
conservative  People’s Party , which is part of the ruling
coalition, 0.2 percentage point higher than in the previous
poll, according to Expresso.  The survey published today was carried out by Eurosondagem
SA from Sept. 10 to 13, and 1,037 valid telephone interviews
were used, Expresso said. The margin of error is 3.04 percent,
Expresso said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
