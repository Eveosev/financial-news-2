European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said  Spain  won’t get help from the
ECB’s bond-purchase program if it doesn’t request a bailout
first, according to an interview with  Austria ’s  Profil  magazine.  “If Spain doesn’t step under the safety umbrella, we can’t
help it,” Nowotny said in the interview. The bond-buying plan
“can be an effective tool to contain the crisis and to
stabilize expectations. However, politics has to play along, so
that this instrument can also be used positively -- this is the
only way to convince the markets,” he said.  Nowotny, who is Austria’s central bank governor, also said
that policy makers and politicians underestimated the contagion
risks of  Greece , according to the interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
