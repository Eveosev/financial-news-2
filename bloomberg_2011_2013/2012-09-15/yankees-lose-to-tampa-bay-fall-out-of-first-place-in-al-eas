The Tampa Bay Rays defeated the
Yankees 6-4 in the opener of a three-game series, knocking New
York temporarily into second place in the American League East
division.  The Yankees (81-63) fell a half-game behind the  Baltimore
Orioles , who are playing a late game at the Oakland Athletics --
who lead the AL wild-card standings.  Elliot Johnson and Desmond Jennings had run-scoring singles
as the Rays scored three runs in the fifth inning. Ben Zobrist
added an RBI single in the seventh and B.J. Upton had a solo
homer in the eighth.  Steve Pearce had an RBI single in the second inning for New
York. Curtis Granderson hit a solo homer in the fifth, his 38th
of the season, and  Alex Rodriguez  had a two-run homer in the
eighth inning.  Derek Jeter  had a fifth-inning infield single for the
Yankees, passing Willie Mays and moving into sole possession on
the Major League Baseball career list with his 3,284th hit.  David Price  (18-5) gave up two runs on five hits in seven
innings for Tampa Bay and Fernando Rodney got the final five
outs for his 43rd save of the season. CC Sabathia (13-6) allowed
four runs on six hits in 6 2/3 innings for the Yankees.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
