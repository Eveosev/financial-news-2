German 10-year  government bonds 
dropped for a second week, with the yield climbing to the most
since April, after the  Federal Reserve  announced a third round
of asset purchases to stimulate the  U.S. economy .  The declines pushed  two-year  note yields to the highest
level in more than two months as investors reduced holdings of
the safest assets. Italian bonds led gains among the so-called
euro-area periphery nations, rising relative to bunds, as
 Germany ’s  Constitutional Court  cleared the way for the setup of
 Europe ’s permanent bailout fund. The yield on German 10-year
bunds yesterday  climbed  the most since Aug. 3 as euro-area
finance ministers met in Cyprus.  “The strength of relief is very large,” said  Marc Ostwald , a fixed-income strategist at Monument Securities Ltd.
in  London . “There’s probably more room for the periphery to
perform because people are desperate for yield.”  Germany’s 10-year yield rose 19 basis points, or 0.19
percentage point in the week, to 1.71 percent at 5 p.m. London
time, after being as high as 1.72 percent, the most since April
30. The 1.5 percent bund due in September 2022 fell 1.695, or
16.95 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,314) face amount to 98.13.  The nation’s two-year yield climbed to 0.106 percent
yesterday, matching the most since July 3.  Italian Spread  The additional yield, or spread, that investors demand to
hold Italian 10-year bonds instead of bunds fell to 331 basis
points yesterday, after being as low as 326 basis points, the
least since April 2. Spanish 10-year bonds yielded 410 basis
points more than bunds, after the spread slipped below 400 basis
points this week for the first time since April.  The U.S. central bank announced on Sept. 13 its third round
of asset purchases since 2008, giving investors the confidence
to buy higher-yielding assets. Stimulus will be expanded until
officials see “sustained improvement” in the labor market, Fed
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said.  German bunds also dropped as the nation’s top
constitutional court cleared Europe’s permanent bailout fund for
ratification, damping demand for the safest government debt.  Germany must make sure its share of the 500 billion-euro
European Stability Mechanism is capped at 190 billion euros, the
court said in its ruling on Sept. 12.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said yesterday
that there’s reason for optimism in Europe.  Draghi Comments  “Financial conditions have been better recently, but we
have to continue working on that,” Draghi said after a meeting
of euro-area finance ministers in Nicosia. “If we continue
going this way, one has to be optimistic.”  Declines by bunds may be limited next week amid speculation
a report will show services and manufacturing industries in
Europe contracted in September.  A composite  index  of both industries was at 46.6 this
month, from 46.4 in August, London-based Markit Economics will

surveyed by Bloomberg. A reading below 50 signals contraction.  German bonds returned 2.5 percent this year through Sept.
13, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish securities
advanced 1.7 percent, while Italy’s debt made 15 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
