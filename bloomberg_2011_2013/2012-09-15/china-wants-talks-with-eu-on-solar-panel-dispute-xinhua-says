China  called on the European Union
to resolve a dispute over solar panel sales through dialogue in
order to safeguard their economic and trade relations, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported today, citing a senior
official of China’s Ministry of Commerce.  “We hope the EU adopts a cautious attitude,” and
“dialogue is the best approach to solving the dispute,” Xinhua
cited Chong Quan, deputy representative for China’s
international trade talks, as saying. Chong was speaking in
Brussels yesterday after talks with Jean-Luc Demarty, the
European Commission’s director general for trade, according to
the report.  The EU on Sept 6 opened a probe into whether Chinese
manufacturers of solar panels sell them below cost in the 27-
nation bloc, a practice known as dumping.  The EU should pay attention to the “over 200,000 jobs”
created in its photovoltaic power system installation industry
by China’s solar panel exports, and also its export to China of
solar raw materials and technological equipment worth tens of
billions of U.S. dollars, Xinhua cited Chong as saying.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
