An unrestored 1928  Mercedes Benz 
kept in a garage for 84 years sold for an above-estimate $4.5
million at a U.K. auction last night.  Wealthy collectors also competed for classic cars made by
marques such as Lagonda, Maserati and Alfa Romeo at the Bonhams
sale in Sussex. The winning bid for the Mercedes -- formally 2.8
million pounds including fees -- came from an unidentified buyer
in the room who prevailed over at least five others.  The Mercedes S-type, a four-seat tourer that dealers dub
the Bugatti Veyron of its day, had been owned by the same
English family since it was purchased in 1928. London-based
Bonhams valued it as much as 2 million pounds, the top lot in
its annual “Goodwood Revival” event.  Like a “barn find,” it was kept since delivery in its
purpose-built motor house and has only 8,375 miles on its
odometer. The price would have been even higher had the 1920s
coachwork been made by Mercedes, rather than Cadogan Motors of
 London , dealers said.  The sale raised a total of 13.5 million pounds, against a
minimum forecast of 10 million pounds. About 75 percent of the
84 cars were successful, Bonhams said.  Bonhams’s presale publicity had also given star billing to
a restored V12 team Lagonda that came fourth in the 1939 Le Mans
24-Hour race.  Bomb Damage  Damaged by a V1 “Doodlebug” flying bomb in 1944, it sold
for 1.3 million pounds with fees, against a high estimate of
more than 1 million pounds, based on hammer prices.  The event followed a record $263.3 million series of summer
auctions in California. Proceeds at August’s sales by  Russo and
Steele , Bonhams, Mecum, RM Auctions and  Gooding & Co . were 33
percent higher than in 2011, according to figures supplied by
the Geneva-based car dealer  Kidston SA .  While prewar cars attracted some of the most selective
bidding in  California , early-20th-century models captured all
four of the highest prices in Sussex.  A 1930 Maserati Tipo 26 four-seater that had raced on the
banked track of Brooklands sold for 1.7 million pounds. One of
two 2.5-litre Tipo 26 cars imported into the U.K. during the
winter of 1930-31, it had been owned by the same collector for
the last 57 years.  A 1929 Alfa Romeo 1750 SS Competition Tourer that was
driven by the amateur racer Leonard Headlam in the inaugural
Irish Grand Prix of that year fetched a further 1.1 million
pounds.  Muse highlights include  Mark Beech  on arts,  Richard Vines 
on food and  Lewis Lapham  on history.  To contact the writer on the story:
