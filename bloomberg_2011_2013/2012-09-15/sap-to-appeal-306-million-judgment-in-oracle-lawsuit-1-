SAP AG (SAP)  filed a notice in court that
it will appeal a judgment against the company in a lawsuit filed
by Oracle Corp. alleging illegal software downloading.  Oracle, the world’s largest maker of  database software , won
a $1.3 billion jury verdict against SAP in 2010. After a federal
judge reduced the verdict, SAP and Oracle agreed to a judgment
calling for SAP to pay at least $306 million if SAP loses the
case after all appeals are exhausted.  SAP, the biggest maker of business-management software, was
sued by Oracle, its biggest competitor, after the discovery that
an SAP software maintenance unit had downloaded and copied
Oracle software. Oracle said Walldorf, Germany-based SAP’s aim
was to avoid paying license fees and to steal customers.  Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, said Aug. 3 in
an e-mail that it would ask the  U.S. Court of Appeals  in San
Francisco to reinstate the jury verdict.  The case is  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  v. SAP AG, 07-1658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland).  To contact the reporter on this story:
