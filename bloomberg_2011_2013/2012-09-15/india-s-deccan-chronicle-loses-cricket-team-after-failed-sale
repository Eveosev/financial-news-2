The  Deccan Chargers  cricket team’s
contract to play in the Indian Premier League was canceled by
the Board of Control for Cricket in  India  after its owner,
 Deccan Chronicle Holdings Ltd. (DECH) , refused to sell the franchise.  The Deccan franchise, winner of the 2009 championship, owes
money to players and foreign boards and Deccan Chronicle
rejected an offer of 4.5 billion rupees ($83 million) in cash
and an equal sum in convertible debt for the team, according to
an e-mailed statement today from Sanjay Jagdale, secretary of
the  Board .  “The deleterious effect such conduct would have on the
reputation of the IPL and the franchise itself” made the
termination necessary, the board said.  Deccan Chronicle, the Secunderabad, India-based publisher
of the newspaper of the same name as well as the Financial
Chronicle and Asian Age, is struggling to repay debt of $919
million. The company said last month it’s facing a “liquidity
crisis.”  Deccan Chronicle gained 0.5 percent to 10.85 rupees in
Mumbai yesterday. The stock has dropped 70 percent this year.  The owners of Deccan Chronicle have pledged 45 percent of
their stake in the company to  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , according to
stock exchange filings. Religare Finvest Ltd. said in a filing
that it controls 14.5 percent of the publisher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
