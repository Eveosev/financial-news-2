Treasury 30-year bond yields
climbed the most in three years after Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben Bernanke ’s pledge to keep adding stimulus even as the
economy improves spurred concern inflation will accelerate.  The yield gap between 10- and 30-year Treasuries widened to
the most in a year yesterday amid bets the value of longer-term
fixed-income holdings will erode more over time. Relative yields
on mortgage securities slid to the lowest on record after the
Fed said Sept. 13 it would expand its holdings with open-ended
monthly purchases of $40 billion of the debt. The U.S. will sell
10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities next week.  “Treasuries are worried about inflation on the heels of
open-ended stimulus,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of interest
rates at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in  New York  one of 21 primary
dealers that trade with the Fed. “That’s why you’ve seen this
major move. It certainly wasn’t friendly to the long end.”  Yields on  30-year bonds  increased 26 basis points, or 0.26
percentage point, this week in New York, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader prices. It was the biggest jump since August 2009.
Yields touched 3.11 percent, the highest level since May 4. The
price of the 2.75 percent security due in August 2042 slumped 5
2/32, or $50.63 per $1,000 face amount, to 93 13/32.  Benchmark 10-year note  yields  added 20 basis points, the
most since the five days ended March 16, to 1.87 percent this
week. They touched 1.89 percent, the highest since May 10.  Yield Curve  The  difference  in yields between 10- and 30- year
Treasuries, called the yield curve, touched 1.23 percentage
points yesterday, the most since September 2011. Thirty-year
bonds, because of their long maturity, are more sensitive to
inflation than shorter-dated Treasuries.  “The shift in the Fed’s stance toward inflation justifies
the move we’ve seen, and then some,” Mike Pond, head of global
inflation-linked research in New York at the primary dealer
Barclays Plc, said yesterday.  The 30-year break-even rate, an indicator of traders’
outlook for annual inflation over the next three decades,
widened yesterday to the most in 13 months. The  rate , the yield
difference between long bonds and comparable TIPS, reached 2.67
percentage points, the most since August 2011. The 2012 average
is 2.30 percentage points.  Bernanke is trying to bring down an  unemployment rate  stuck
above 8 percent since February 2009.  The  Federal Open Market Committee  said after a two-day
meeting it would continue buying assets, undertake additional
purchases and employ other policy tools as appropriate “if the
outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially.”  ‘Considerable Time’  The FOMC said in a statement it would probably hold its
benchmark  interest rate  at virtually zero “at least through mid-
2015.” It said “a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy
will remain appropriate for a considerable time” after economic
growth builds momentum.  Stocks and commodities rose as risk appetite gained. The
 Standard & Poor’s 500 (SPX)  Index advanced 1.9 percent for the week,
and S&P’s GSCI index of raw materials climbed 2.6 percent.  “Leaving their purchases open-ended and extending their
guidance means a steeper yield curve, as there is more inflation
risk,” said  Sean Murphy , a trader in New York at the primary
dealer  Societe Generale . “The need to come out with the
operation at all is alerting everyone that there is a long road
in this recovery and there are still many things that need to be
addressed.”  Mortgage Bonds  A Bloomberg index of yields on Fannie Mae-guaranteed
mortgage bonds trading closest to face value fell about one
basis point to 92 basis points higher than an average of five-
and 10-year Treasury rates yesterday in New York. It was the
narrowest spread since at least 1984.  The U.S. consumer price index rose in August 0.6 percent
from the previous month, the biggest increase since June 2009,
and advanced 1.7 percent from a year earlier, Commerce
Department data showed yesterday. The figures matched the
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Treasuries were the most volatile among developed-market
 government bonds  yesterday, according to measures of 10-year
bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year securities, and
credit default swaps.  Daily  volume  reported by ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer
broker of  U.S. government debt , reached $464 billion on Sept.
13, the highest level in 13 months. Volume has averaged $262
billion over the past five years.  Less Expensive  U.S. government securities traded at the least expensive
level in three weeks yesterday, according to the 10-year term
premium, a model created by economists at the Fed that includes
expectations for interest rates, growth and inflation. The gauge
was at negative 0.81 percent, the least costly since Aug. 21. A
negative reading shows investors are willing to accept yields
below what’s considered fair value. The average this year is
negative 0.73 percent.  The Treasury auctioned $66 billion in notes and bonds this
week, including $13 billion in 30-year debt on Sept. 13 an hour
before the Fed issued its statement. The sale drew a yield of
2.896 percent, versus a forecast of 2.929 percent in a Bloomberg
News survey of primary dealers. The  bid-to-cover  ratio, which
gauges demand by comparing total bids with the amount of
securities offered, was 2.68, versus 2.41 at the July sale.  The government sold $32 billion of three-year notes on
Sept. 11 at a bid-to-cover ratio of 3.94, the highest on record.
It auctioned $21 billion in 10-year notes the next day at a
ratio of 2.85, versus an average 3.09 at the previous 10 sales.  Net Long  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long position in 30-year bond futures in the week
ended Sept. 11, before the Fed meeting, according to U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Speculative long positions, or bets prices  will rise ,
outnumbered short positions by 20,088 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Net-long positions rose by 5,457 contracts, or
37 percent, from a week earlier, the Washington-based commission
said in its Commitments of Traders report. As recently as the
week ended Aug. 28, the speculators had a net short position of
4,129 contracts.  The U.S. will sell $13 billion of 10-year TIPS Sept. 20.
The previous sale of the securities, a $15 billion offering on
July 19, drew a record low yield of negative 0.637 percent.  TIPS have returned 6.2 percent this year, versus 1.7
percent for Treasuries that do not provide inflation protection,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. Thirty-year
bonds gained 0.9 percent, the gauges showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
