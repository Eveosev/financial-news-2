Belgian Finance Minister Steven Vanackere comments on European Union proposals for a banking
union and supervision by the  European Central Bank .  Vanackere spoke to reporters today in Nicosia, Cyprus
before a meeting of European finance ministers and central bank
chiefs.  “It is absolutely necessary to execute what Herman van Rompuy agreed on in June. One of the four parts to ensure a
bigger budgetary unification of course is the banking union. So
we should ensure commissioner Barnier gets sufficient support
for his proposals. At the same time everyone recognizes it won’t
be completed right away and many questions need answering.  “The manner of supervision needs to be sufficiently
coherent. That means where national central banks supervise
smaller institutions for instance, those that aren’t systemic,
that supervision should be carried out according to the rules
decided on ECB level.  “It is important to keep up the pace. Government leaders
have decided they want a clear vision before the end of the
year.  “If there is European supervision it would be obvious that
it would encompass systemic and state supported banks first and
then is rolled out further.” For Belgium, that would apply to
 Dexia SA (DEXB) , he said.  “It’s a balance between taking responsibility and
solidarity. It is normal that those who are asked to show a lot
of solidarity want to verify first that everyone takes their
responsibility.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
