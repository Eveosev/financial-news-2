Allied Pilots Association  filed a
notice it will appeal the bankruptcy judge’s ruling that allowed
 AMR Corp. (AAMRQ) ’s American Airlines to throw out its labor agreement
with pilots.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane in Manhattan on Sept. 4
granted American’s request to reject the pilots’ contract,
saying proposed changes to the agreement are necessary for the
airline’s restructuring.  The pilot’s group will ask a federal appeals court in New
York to consider whether Lane’s reasoning was in error because
the company made no effort to show that it coudldn’t reorganize
with lesser earnings and concessions sought exceeded those
needed for competitive pilot labor costs, according to a filing
yesterday.  The “company demanded concessions on numerous specific
terms that are wholly unnecessary to reorganization in light of
the company’s own business plan and the APA’s
counterproposals,” Joshua Taylor, a lawyer for the pilot’s
association, said in the filing.  The case is In re AMR Corp., 11-15463,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
