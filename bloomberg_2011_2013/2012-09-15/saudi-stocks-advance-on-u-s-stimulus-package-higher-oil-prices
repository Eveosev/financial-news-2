Shares in  Saudi Arabia (SASEIDX)  rose the
most in seven weeks after U.S. stocks advanced for a second
straight week on the  Federal Reserve ’s plan to buy mortgage
securities and on higher  oil prices .  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s largest
petrochemical maker known as Sabic, rose to the highest level
since May 23.  National Industrialization Co. (NIC) , an industrial and
manufacturing firm, climbed the most since in July 31. Etihad
Etisalat Co., a Saudi telecommunications operator, gained the
most in a week.  The Tadawul All Share Index gained 0.9 percent to 7,165.86,
the highest level since May 13, in Riyadh at 3:30 p.m. The Arab
world’s biggest stock market has increased 12 percent this year.  The U.S. “stimulus will be a factor domestically as the
 S&P 500  reached near five-year highs,” Asim Bukhtiar, head of
research at Riyad Capital, said in response to e-mailed
questions. “We expect positive opening this morning on the
heels of strong gains in developed markets over the past two
days. Petrochemicals should benefit from $99 crude.”  Equities rallied as the Fed said on Sept. 13 that it will
expand its holdings of long-term securities with open-ended
purchases of $40 billion of mortgage debt a month in a third
round of quantitative easing as it seeks to boost growth and
reduce unemployment. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.9
percent this week to 1,465.77, extending its two-week rally to
4.2 percent. The index is 6.8 percent away from its all-time
high set in October 2007.  Oil climbed to the highest level in more than four months
as the Fed’s plan boosted demand for commodities and stocks.
Crude oil for October delivery advanced yesterday by 69 cents,
or 0.7 percent, to $99 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest settlement since May 3. Futures touched
$100.42 in intraday trading. Prices increased 2.7 percent this
week and are up 11 percent from a year ago.  Sabic  gained  2.7 percent to 95 riyals, while National
Industrialization  increased  1.8 percent to 33.2 riyals. Etihad
Etisalat rose 1.5 percent to 70 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse operating on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
