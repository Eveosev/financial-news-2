Australia rallied to beat Argentina
23-19 and secure its second straight victory in the southern
hemisphereâ€™s Rugby Championship.  In the first rugby Test to be played on the  Gold Coast , the
Pumas led 19-6 with 23 minutes to go before Australia scored
tries through  Pat McCabe  and Digby Ioane that were converted by
 Berrick Barnes . Kurtley Beale added a last-minute penalty.  The victory lifted Australia above South Africa into second
place in the championship standings. New Zealand earlier beat
the Springboks 21-11 in Dunedin to extend its tournament lead.
The All Blacks have 16 points through four matches and will
secure the inaugural title by winning either of its remaining
games in Argentina or South Africa.  The fifth round is scheduled for Sept. 29, when Argentina
hosts New Zealand and Australia travels to South Africa.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
