Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) 
chose the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority as the preferred bidder
for 42 hotels it owns following loan defaults,  Property Week 
reported, without saying where it obtained the information.  The sovereign-wealth fund offered 620 million pounds ($973
million) for the hotels operated by Marriott, the publication
said on its website today.  RBS and the fund didnâ€™t immediately return calls seeking
comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
