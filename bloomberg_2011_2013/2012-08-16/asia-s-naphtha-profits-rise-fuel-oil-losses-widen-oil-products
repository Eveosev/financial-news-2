Refiners’ profits from producing
naphtha in  Asia  rose to the highest level in more than three
months. Losses from making  fuel oil  widened.  Light Distillates  Japan naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $25.55, or 41 percent, to $87.97 a metric ton at
12:50 p.m.  Singapore  time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The premium is the widest since May 4.  Naphtha swaps for September gained $25.25, or 2.7 percent,
to $963.50 a ton, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
a broker.  In Singapore, gasoline’s premium to naphtha closed at
$22.66 a barrel yesterday, falling for the first time in six
days, Bloomberg data showed. The premium, or  reforming margin ,
widened to $26.27 on Aug. 17, the biggest in 10 months. A wider
gap signals it’s more profitable for producers to make motor
fuel from naphtha.  Middle Distillates  The  premium  of gasoil to Dubai crude rose 2 cents, or 0.1
percent, to $19.15 a barrel, PVM data showed. Gasoil swaps for
September gained $2.10, or 1.6 percent, to $130.15 a barrel.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil fell for a second day, PVM
data showed. The spread, or  regrade , dropped 10 cents to 90
cents a barrel, indicating it’s less profitable to produce
 aviation fuel  over diesel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil’s  discount  to Dubai crude widened 31
cents to $3.64 a barrel, PVM data showed.  Fuel oil  swaps for
September rose $11.25, or 1.7 percent, to $681.75 a ton.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged at $13 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
