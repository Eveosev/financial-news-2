The Australia and New Zealand
currencies advanced for a third day against the yen as rising
commodities prices supported the outlook for exports.  The  New Zealand dollar , known as the kiwi, maintained gains
against most major counterparts from yesterday after Auckland-
based Fonterra Cooperative Group Ltd., the world’s largest dairy
exporter, said whole-milk powder prices reached a two-month
high. Demand for the South Pacific nations’ currencies was
limited before U.S. data forecast to show housing starts hovered
around the highest level since 2008, adding to speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will refrain from further stimulus measures.  “Higher commodity prices are lending some support to the
Aussie and kiwi,” said  Daisaku Ueno , a senior foreign-exchange
and fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co. in  Tokyo , a unit of Japan’s biggest listed bank.
“Good U.S. data are essentially a plus for the growth-related
currencies, but no additional stimulus from the Fed as a result
may be a disappointment at the same time.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to 83.06 yen at 4:16
p.m. in Sydney from the close yesterday, when it gained 0.5
percent. The Aussie slid 0.3 percent to $1.0477, following a 0.2
percent advance yesterday. The kiwi fetched 80.60 U.S. cents
from 80.71, after yesterday climbing from 80.37, the weakest
since July 27. It added 0.2 percent to 63.90 yen.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials
rose for a second day yesterday, gaining 0.5 percent. The  yield 
on 10-year government notes in  Australia  climbed today as much
as 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 3.52 percent,
rising above the central bank’s  overnight cash-rate target , for
the first time since March. The key interest rate is currently
held at 3.5 percent.  Milk Prices  Whole-milk powder for October delivery rose 7.3 percent,
according to a trade-weighted index on Fonterra’s
GlobalDairyTrade  website . The near-term contract gained to
$2,870 a metric ton, the most since June 19.  U.S.  housing starts  were at a 756,000 annual pace in July
after reaching a 760,000 rate in June, the fastest since October
2008, according to the median estimate of economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before today’s report.  Fed Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  said the  U.S.
economy  probably won’t lapse into recession in 2013 and that new
stimulus wouldn’t spur growth. He spoke in a CNBC interview
yesterday.  The U.S. central bank has held its target for overnight
bank lending in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 and
plans to keep it there at least through late 2014 to stimulate
the world’s biggest economy. The Fed also bought $2.3 trillion
of mortgage and Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds
asset purchases known as quantitative easing, or QE.  Upside Surprise  “If U.S. data continue to surprise to the upside, then the
market is likely to scale back expectations of QE, which could
result in a risk-off response,” strategists  Mary Nicola , Kiran Kowshik, Michael Sneyd and  Steven Saywell  at BNP Paribas SA
wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  In China, Premier  Wen Jiabao  said easing inflation is
allowing room to adjust monetary policy. The Asian nation,
Australia’s biggest trading partner and New Zealand’s second-
largest export destination, has cut the reserve-requirement
ratio for banks three times starting in November and lowered
 interest rates  in June and July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
