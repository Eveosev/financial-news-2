The ruble gained against the dollar
as crude,  Russia ’s main export earner, traded at the highest in
more than three months.  The currency appreciated 0.2 percent to 31.8900 per  dollar ,
the most since Aug. 6.  Crude traded in  New York  rose for a third day, adding as as
much as 0.8 percent percent to $95.14 a barrel. That would be
the highest close since May 11. Oil and natural gas contribute
about 50 percent of Russia’s government budget revenue.  Rising oil prices today were supporting the ruble, Igor Akinshin, a Moscow-based currency trader at  Alfa Bank  said by
phone. Russian exporters may support the currency next week as
they pay taxes by month-end, he said.  Investors pared bets on the ruble weakening against the
dollar, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
32.3878 in three months versus 32.4230 on Aug. 15.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose two basis points to 223,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. Yields on
the government’s ruble bonds due April 2021 fell one basis point
today 7.86 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The ruble weakened 0.6 percent to 39.4025 per euro and lost
0.2 percent against the central bank’s target euro-dollar basket
to 35.2569.  To contact the reporters on this story:
