Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
 Switzerland ’s second-biggest bank, said bankers chose to convert
about 50 percent of their future payments from a bonus plan for
shares in the lender.  The swap will increase common equity by 550 million Swiss
francs ($561.6 million) this year, the Zurich-based bank said in
an e-mailed statement today. While that was below the targeted
750 million-franc capital boost, the shortfall was more than
compensated for by a higher benefit achieved from the repurchase
of 4.8 billion francs in bonds.  Together the two measures will boost common equity by 930
million francs this year, exceeding the 800 million-franc
target, the bank said. The swap and repurchase of bonds were
among the measures Credit Suisse announced last month to
increase capital by about 15.3 billion francs to appease
regulators.  Employees could choose to convert so-called Adjustable
Performance Plan Awards, given as part of bonuses for 2009 and
2010, for stock at 16.29 francs a share. The Adjustable
Performance Plan Awards were a cash-based deferred compensation
plan, with payouts linked to the financial performance of the
employees’ business areas and the company’s return on equity.  Credit Suisse Chief Executive Officer  Brady Dougan  said
last month the bank’s executive board would participate in the
exchange with all of its awards.  To contact the reporter on this story:
