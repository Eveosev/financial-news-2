Dry conditions persisted throughout
 Kazakhstan  in the first 10 days of August, the national weather
service, known as Kazhydromet, said.  Drought has caused drying of grain leaves and made grain
ears underdeveloped in all regions of Kazakhstan in the period,
the weather service said today on its website. Most of the
country suffers from insufficient moisture, it said.  Kazakhstan may lose 353,000 hectares (872,282 acres) of
planted grains, or 2 percent of the total area sown, from
drought, Agriculture Minister Asylzhan Mamytbekov said July 24.  The grain crop will be 13 million metric tons this year,
down from a record 26.9 million tons in 2011 due to the lack of
rain, according to the government.  To contact the reporter on this story:
