Japanese  stocks  rose, with the
Nikkei 225 Stock Average closing at a six-week high, after
Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said slowing inflation will allow
more room to adjust monetary policy in the world’s second-
largest economy.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a manufacturer of robotics used in Chinese
factories, climbed 4.3 percent.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker that
gets almost 60 percent of its revenue from the U.S. and Europe,
rose 2.8 percent after the yen weakened. Dai-Ichi Life Insurance
Co. soared 6.6 percent, leading the sector higher after its
investment in Janus Capital Group Inc. was called positive by
Moody’s Investors Service.  “Monetary easing is taking effect in  China ,” said  Kiyoshi Ishigane , a Tokyo-based strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset
Management Co., which oversees about $70 billion. “The premier
seldom makes such direct remarks, but he might want to emphasize
that the government wants to support the economy by monetary
policies.”  The Nikkei 225 climbed 1.9 percent to 9,092.76 at the 3 p.m.
close in  Tokyo , its highest close since July 4. Volume on the
gauge was about same as the 30-day average, even with many
investors off this week for O-bon holidays. The broader  Topix (TPX) 
Index rose 1.6 percent to 759.12, with almost four stocks
advancing for each that fell.  Stocks rose on the Chinese premier’s comments on possible
easing. There’s “growing room for monetary policy operation,”
Wen said yesterday during an inspection tour of the eastern
province of Zhejiang, according to state media. “We have the
conditions and capabilities, and will be sure to fulfill this
year’s economic and social development targets.” Downward
pressure on the economy remains “relatively large,” he added.  Fanuc climbed 4.3 percent to 13,120 yen, the biggest
contributor to the  Nikkei 225 (NKY) ’s gain. TDK Corp., a manufacturer
of electronic parts that gets more than 25 percent of its sales
from China, rose 3.1 percent to 3,505 yen.  U.S. Manufacturing  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  rose 0.2 percent
today. The gauge added 0.1 percent yesterday in New York as
investors weighed manufacturing data for clues as to whether the
 Federal Reserve  will move to stimulate the economy.  Industrial production in the U.S. increased in July, Fed
data showed, propelled by a rise in motor vehicle output and a
rebound in power use during the hottest month on record. A
separate report showed manufacturing in the New York region
unexpectedly contracted in August, the first decline since
October.  “The U.S. economic data are mixed and business sentiment
is neither good nor bad,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees
about $633 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
Co. “That’s boosting expectations the Fed may add to
quantitative easing.”  Yen Weakens  The yen depreciated to as low as 79.36 against the dollar
in Tokyo, from 79.01 when stocks started trading today. Against
the euro, Japan’s currency eased to as low as 97.47 from 97.09.
A weaker yen boosts overseas income at Japanese companies when
repatriated.  Canon, the world’s biggest camera maker, rose 2.8 percent
to 2,764 yen.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that gets almost half
its sales in the U.S. and Europe, gained 1.8 percent to 783 yen.  The Topix has rebounded 9.2 percent from this year’s low on
June 4 as central banks around the world ease policy to support
growth. The price of shares on the gauge stood at 0.9 times book
value, compared with 2.2 times for the S&P 500 and 1.4 times for
the  Europe  Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means that
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Insurers lead gains among the Topix’s 33 industry groups.
Dai-Ichi Life Insurance gained the most on the Nikkei 225,
rising 6.6 percent to 86,700 yen, after Moody’s said the
insurer’s agreement to acquire up to 20 percent of fund manager
Janus’s equity is credit positive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
