The French market watchdog is
investigating possible  insider trading  relating to  Wendel SA (MF) ,
 France ’s largest publicly traded investment firm, Le Point
reported, without saying where it got its information.  Autorite des Marches Financiers is looking into the
increase in Wendel’s share price that followed the company’s
announcement in November that it had entered exclusive talks to
sell Deutsch Group SAS to  TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL) , the magazine
said on its  website  yesterday. Separately, the Ministry of
Finance is pursuing tax fraud complaints targeting Wendel
chairman Ernest-Antoine Seilliere and 13 current and former
executives, according to Le Point.  Barbara Frugier, a spokeswoman for AMF, and Christine
Anglade Pirzadeh, a spokeswoman for Wendel, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
