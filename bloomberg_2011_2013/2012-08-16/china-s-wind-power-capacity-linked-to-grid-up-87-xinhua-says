China connected 50.26 gigawatts of
wind-generated capacity to the nation’s largest electricity grid
as of this year, the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing a
statement from China State Grid Corp.  Growth in the on-grid wind power capacity was up 87 percent
annually over the last six years, Xinhua reported, citing the
larger of China’s two transmission operators. Grid-linked
capacity will rise to 100 gigawatts by 2015 and 200 gigawatts by
2020, according to the report published yesterday.  China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases,
plans to have at least 15 percent of its energy mix come from
non-fossil fuels by 2020. Wind farms are the second-biggest
contributor to renewable-energy capacity in the nation after
 hydropower dams .  Regional concentrations of wind resources and a lack of
links between local electricity networks and the national grid
prevent the efficient use of wind power, Xinhua reported, citing
State Grid.  China needs to accelerate the construction of trans-
regional grids to meet its energy-development targets, Xinhua
said, citing Shu Yinbiao, a deputy general manager at State Grid.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
