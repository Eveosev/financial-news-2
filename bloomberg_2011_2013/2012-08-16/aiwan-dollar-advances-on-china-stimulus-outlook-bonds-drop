Taiwan ’s dollar weakened for a
second day after a report showed foreign direct investment
slumped to a two-year low in  China , the island’s No. 1 export
destination.  Government bonds  dropped.  The currency reversed an earlier gain, while the benchmark
Taiex index of stocks pared an advance of as much as 0.6
percent. Overseas investment in China fell 8.7 percent in July
from a year earlier to $7.58 billion, the smallest inflow since
July 2010, the government said in Beijing today.  “The Taiwanese economy will be affected in the short term
as about 40 percent of exports go to China,” said Mill Lin, an
economist in Taipei at Chinatrust Commercial Bank. “The
currency is still supported by fund inflows, so it’s likely to
be stable or appreciate over the long run.”  The local dollar dropped 0.1 percent to NT$30.02 against
its U.S. counterpart at the close, according to Taipei Forex
Inc. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, increased nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 3.40 percent.  Global funds boosted their holdings of Taiwanese equities
by $571 million in the last three days, building on net
purchases of $1.7 billion last week, stock exchange data showed.  The currency earlier rose as much as 0.5 percent to
NT$29.86 after China’s Premier Wen Jiabao said yesterday there’s
“growing room for monetary policy operations” as  Asia ’s
biggest economy faces downward pressure.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022
climbed one basis point to 1.19 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight money-market rate  was little
changed at 0.392 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
