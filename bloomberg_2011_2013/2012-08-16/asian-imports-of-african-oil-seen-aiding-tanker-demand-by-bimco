Increased Asian imports of West
African oil may lift demand for very large crude carriers as
daily rates stay below $15,000, according to the Baltic and
International Maritime Council, known as Bimco.  “Average earnings in the VLCC segment will keep owners on
the rack, as they are unlikely to escape the agonizing lows
around $2,000-$15,000 per day,” Peter Sand, an analyst at the
Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based trade group representing 65 percent of
ship owners, said in an e-mailed report. “A potential upside
could come from increased Asian imports from West Africa.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
