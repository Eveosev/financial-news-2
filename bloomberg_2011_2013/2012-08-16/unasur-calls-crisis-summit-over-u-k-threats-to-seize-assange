Ecuador  said the Union of South
American Nations called an emergency meeting to discuss U.K.
“threats” to seize WikiLeak’s founder Julian Assange from
inside its embassy in London.  The 12-nation group, known as Unasur, will hold a meeting
of foreign ministers on Aug. 19 in the Ecuadorean coastal city
of Guayaquil, according to a statement published today in the
country’s presidential  gazette . Ecuador’s Foreign Minister
Ricardo Patino said yesterday he also requested an emergency
meeting of the Washington-based  Organization of American States 
as well as the Venezuelan-led group of nations known as ALBA.  Ecuador accused the U.K. yesterday of threatening to
“assault” its embassy in London and arrest Assange, who is
seeking sanctuary in the South American nation. Today, Assange
was granted asylum over U.K. objections, setting up a
confrontation with Britain after it said it would not allow him
safe passage out of the country.  “The unauthorized entry of any British authority into the
Ecuadorean Embassy compound would be a flagrant violation” of
international treaties protecting diplomatic missions, the
statement said.  U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague  said today his
government won’t storm the embassy and was seeking a
“diplomatic solution” to the impasse.  Unasur’s 12 members are Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia,
Colombia, Chile, Ecuador,  Guyana , Paraguay, Peru, Surinam,
Uruguay and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
