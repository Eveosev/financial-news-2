Electronic Arts Inc. (EA) , the second-
largest U.S. video-game publisher, rose the most in more than
six months after the New York Post reported that the company is
exploring a sale.  EA rose 7.1 percent to $14.02 at 9:44 a.m. in New York. The
stock climbed as high as $14.32 earlier in today’s session,
marking the biggest intraday gain since Feb. 2.  The company is interested in doing a deal at $20 a share
and has been approached by private-equity firms, the Post
 reported , citing unnamed people familiar with the discussions.
The talks are still in early stages, the newspaper said.  EA shares had slumped 36 percent this year through
yesterday as it struggled to shift to Internet-based video
games. Chief Executive Officer John Riccitiello is adding online
titles to reduce the company’s reliance on declining sales
through retail stores.  Jeff Brown , a spokesman for  Redwood City , California-based
EA, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
