Saudi Aramco Shell Refinery Co. ,
also known as Sasref, started a gasoil hydrotreating unit at its
refinery in Jubail after a glitch, Asharq al-Awsat newspaper
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Abdullah al-Baiz.  The unit halted earlier this month, the London-based pan-
Arab daily reported on its  website  yesterday, without saying
when it was shut. Hydrotreaters remove sulfur and other
impurities from fuels to improve their quality and meet tougher
environmental standards.  Sasref, a 50-50 joint venture between Saudi Arabian Oil Co.
and  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , has a capacity to process 305,000
barrels a day of crude, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
