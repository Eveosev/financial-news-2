Vietnam ’s five-year bonds advanced
on speculation slowing inflation will increase room for policy
makers to lower borrowing costs to spur growth. The dong was
stable.  Interest rates  may be reduced further if the pace of
consumer-price gains slows, Nguyen Thi Hong, head of the central
bank’s monetary-policy department, said in an article in online
newspaper VnEconomy on Aug. 10. Inflation eased to a 32-month
low of 5.35 percent in July, government data show. The central
bank has cut its key refinance rate five times this year to 10
percent from 15 percent.  “Demand for  government bonds  returned in both primary and
secondary markets in response to expectations that the central
bank will again lower the deposit cap to give banks room to
lower lending rates,” Nguyen Duy Phong, an analyst at Viet
Capital Securities Co. in  Ho Chi Minh City , wrote in a research
note today.  The benchmark five-year yield slid one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 9.61 percent, according to a daily fixing
from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,850 per dollar as of 5 p.m. in Hanoi,
from 20,860 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The central bank set its  reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged
since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
