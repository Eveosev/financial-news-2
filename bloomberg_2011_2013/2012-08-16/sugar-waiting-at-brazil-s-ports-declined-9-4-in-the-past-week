The amount of sugar waiting to be
loaded at the main ports in  Brazil , the largest producer,
dropped 9.4 percent in the past week, according to data from
shipping agency Williams Servicos Maritimos Ltda.  About 2.3 million metric tons of sugar were ready for
loading yesterday at the ports of Paranagua and Santos, the
country’s biggest, data from Recife, Brazil-based Williams
Brasil e-mailed yesterday showed. That compares with about 2.5
million tons a week earlier. Most of the sugar was heading to
China, India and  Canada , the data showed.  About 7 percent, or 163,155 tons, of all the sugar waiting
loading was heading to India, the second-biggest producer and
largest consumer. Imports of sugar for domestic consumption and
for domestic refining to export later are “beginning to make
sense,” Peter de Klerk, an analyst at Czarnikow Group Ltd.,
which traded sugar in 90 countries last year, said on Aug. 9.  India ’s monsoon, which brings 70 percent of the country’s
rainfall, was 15 percent of the 50-year average yesterday, the
 India Meteorological Department  said. Its crop will be 24
million tons in the season that starts Oct. 1, down from 26
million tons a year earlier, according to Armajaro Trading Group
Ltd., a London-based supplier of sugar, cocoa and coffee.  White, or refined, sugar for October delivery fell 0.8
percent to $560.60 a ton by 5:19 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London.
Raw sugar for October delivery was down 0.3 percent at 20.23
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  To contact the reporters on this story:
