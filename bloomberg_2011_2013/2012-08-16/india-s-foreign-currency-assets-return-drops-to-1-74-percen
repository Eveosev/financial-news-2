India’s foreign-currency  assets  and
gold returned 1.74 percent in the year ended June 2011, versus
2.09 percent in the same period the previous year, the central
bank said today.  The drop in rate of earnings reflected the “generally low
global interest rate environment,” the  Reserve Bank  of  India 
said in its report on management of foreign exchange reserves.  The central bank had invested $140.3 billion in securities
as of March 31, 2012, out of the total foreign currency assets
of $260 billion, according to the report. The amount invested in
securities was $144.4 billion as of Sept. 20, 2011, or 52
percent of the total assets that stood at $275.7 billion.  Deposits with other central banks,  Bank for International
Settlements  and the  International Monetary Fund  was $114.3
billion as of March 31, compared with $125.8 billion on Sept.
30, the central bank said.  Funds placed with commercial banks and external asset
managers were $5.5 billion as of March 31. The amount was $5.48
billion as of Sept. 30, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
