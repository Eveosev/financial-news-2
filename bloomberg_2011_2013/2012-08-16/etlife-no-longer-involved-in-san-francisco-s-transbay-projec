MetLife Inc. (MET) , the U.S. insurer with
a $60 billion real estate portfolio, is no longer a partner in
the Transbay Tower development in San Francisco, which would be
the city’s tallest office building should it be constructed.  “MetLife is not involved in the project,”  Christopher Breslin , a spokesman for the New York-based company, wrote today
in an e-mail. MetLife was still a partner as of mid-June,
according to  San Francisco Business Times .  The 1,101-foot (336-meter) building in San Francisco’s
South of Market area is being developed by Hines, which won a
2007 competition to design and construct the tower with MetLife
as its financial partner. The Houston-based developer and
MetLife negotiated a term sheet to buy land at First and Mission
streets, Hines  said in 2008 .  Paul Paradis, a Hines senior managing director, and Adam
Alberti, spokesman for the Transbay Joint Powers Authority, both
declined to comment on financing for the tower. The authority
ran the competition and is a counter-party to the tower plan.  Hines agreed to pay the Transbay Joint Powers Authority
about $180 million for the land, Alberti said in the interview
yesterday. The payment will be applied to a new regional bus and
rail station, under construction next to the tower site, he
said. The transit center’s estimated total cost is $1.5 billion,
paid for in part by federal and local transportation funds,
bridge tolls and fees, Alberti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
