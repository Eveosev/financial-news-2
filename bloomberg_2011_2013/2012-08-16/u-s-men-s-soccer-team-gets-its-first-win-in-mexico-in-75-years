The U.S. men’s soccer team got its
first victory in  Mexico  in 25 games spanning 75 years, winning
1-0 on an 80th-minute goal by Michael Orozco Fiscal.  The U.S. had been 0-23-1 all-time in Mexico before
yesterday’s international exhibition victory at Azteca Stadium
in Mexico City.  “It’s huge for all American fans and it’s huge for the
team,” U.S. coach  Jurgen Klinsmann  said in comments distributed
by the U.S. Soccer Federation. “It’s historic. We were well
aware we’ve never won here at Azteca, and this is an amazing
experience for all the players.”  Orozco Fiscal, who plays his club ball with San Luis in
Mexico, made his first appearance for the U.S. team since
October 2011 and tallied his first international goal. Mexico
outshot the U.S. 15-6 and held a 10-0 advantage in corner kicks,
yet the American team held on for the win as goaltender Tim Howard made two diving saves in the final 10 minutes.  “Eventually, you need a little bit of luck, and in some
instances we were a little bit lucky, and we had  Tim Howard  in
our goal,” Klinsmann said. “It was difficult at high altitude
and many of them flew in from Europe two days ago, but we had a
plan and we tried to execute that plan. Getting that win here is
quite enjoyable.”  The victory comes ahead of the U.S. team’s World Cup
qualifying games against  Jamaica  on Sept. 7 in Kingston and
Sept. 11 in Columbus, Ohio. The U.S. and Jamaica both have a
1-0-1 record in qualifying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
