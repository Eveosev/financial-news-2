Treasuries fell, pushing 30-year
bond  yields  to the highest level since May, as data pointed to
improvement in the  U.S. economy , damping demand for the safety
of  U.S. debt .  Primary dealers submitted the highest level of offers since
November as the Federal Reserve bought $1.9 billion of
Treasuries due from February 2040 to August 2041 as part of its
program to boost the economy. Government reports on housing
starts and weekly jobless claims boosted speculation that the
pace of the economy dims the chances of additional central bank
monetary stimulus.  “People are being forced out of positions that they may
have put on at not-so-great levels,” said  Thomas Roth , senior
Treasury trader in New York at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities USA
Inc. “The market was looking for the end of the world, looking
for the Fed to extend quantitative easing. The better numbers
and no bad news out of  Europe  has put that story on hold.”  The 30-year bond  yield  rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 2.95 percent at 5:01 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It touched 2.98
percent, the most since May 14. The price of the 2.75 percent
security due in August 2042 fell 20/32, or $6.25 per $1,000 of
face amount, to 95 31/32.  Yield Increase  The three-day rise in the 30-year yield of 20 basis points
is the biggest since the June 4-to-June 6 period when it added
22 basis points.  Benchmark 10-year yields rose two basis points to 1.84
percent, after touching the most since May 11.  Treasuries have handed investors a 1.4 percent loss this
month, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. An index
of sovereign bonds around the world dropped 0.6 percent, the
data show.  Valuation measures show U.S. sovereign securities are the
closest to fair value since May 3. The term premium, a model
created by economists at the Fed, rose to negative 0.71 percent.
It’s climbed from a record negative 1.02 percent on July 24.
Negative readings indicate investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value.  Dealers offered to sell to the Fed $3.58 of debt for every
dollar the central bank purchased, the highest proportion of
offers for debt maturing in 2036 or later since Nov. 7. Longer-
term Treasuries pared gains after the Fed’s purchase, which
consisted of three $500 million blocks of securities and one of
$446 million.  Fed Buys  “Given the market reaction, it seems like these were sold
through market prices” or at a price below current trading,
suggesting the presence of an “aggressive seller to the Fed,”
said Shyam Rajan, an interest-rate strategist with Bank of
America Corp., one of the 21 primary dealers that trade with the
central bank.  Treasuries also erased gains amid a report that  Spain  will
seek additional financial aid as European leaders seek to
contain the region’s debt crisis.  Spain will apply for aid at a meeting of finance ministers
and central bank governors next month, allowing the  European
Central Bank  to buy Spanish government debt in the secondary
market once approval is won, according to a Medley Global
Advisors report Bloomberg News obtained. Medley officials
weren’t immediately available to comment.  Market Reversal  The 10-day relative-strength index, a gauge of momentum,
for the  10-year note , was 70.7 today from 47.5 Aug. 2. A level
below 30 or above 70 suggests the yield may change direction.
The index reached 28.5 on July 24, the day before the 10-year
yields fell to a record low 1.379 percent.  The 10-year yield failed to breach 1.86 percent, its 200-
day moving average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
yield has been below its 200-day moving average on April 6.  “Yesterday may have represented a bit of a catharsis, a
purging of positions,” said  Chris Ahrens , head interest-rate
strategist at UBS AG in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , one of the 21
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “The economic backdrop
remains shabby. You’re at the top of the band at RSI.”  Investors received 0.94 percentage point of additional
 yield  by buying 10-year notes in the U.S. instead of  Japan . The
difference was almost the most since May.  New-home starts fell 1.1 percent to a 746,000 annual rate
from June’s 754,000 pace, Commerce Department figures showed
today in  Washington . The median estimate of 79 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for 756,000. Building permits,
a proxy for future construction, rose to an 812,000 pace, the
most since August 2008.  Employment Data  Jobless claims climbed by 2,000 to 366,000 in the week
ended Aug. 11, Labor Department figures showed today in
Washington. The median forecast of 45 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for an increase to 365,000.  The U.S. added 163,000 jobs last month, a government report
showed on Aug. 3, more than the 100,000 projected by analysts.
Retail sales rose 0.8 percent, the biggest increase since
February, Commerce Department figures showed Aug. 14. Industrial
production increased 0.6 percent in July from June, the  Federal
Reserve  reported yesterday.  The U.S. central bank has held its target for overnight
lending in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 and plans
to keep it there at least through late 2014 to stimulate the
world’s biggest economy. The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of
mortgage and Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of
so-called quantitative easing to cap borrowing costs. It’s now
in the process of swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its
holdings with those due in six to 30 years to put downward
pressure on long-term borrowing costs.  Treasury Auction  The Treasury announced it will sell $14 billion in 4-year
8-month inflation-indexed notes on Aug. 23. The U.S. has sold
$1.327 trillion of securities at auction this year, with
investors bidding 3.15 times that amount, surpassing last year’s
record bid-to-cover ratio of 3.04.  An index of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities has
declined 2.1 percent this month, based on the Bank of America
Merrill Lynch figures. The U.S. consumer-price index rose 1.4
percent in July from the year before, the smallest increase
since November 2010, Labor Department data yesterday showed.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity TIPS, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer
prices during the life of the debt, has widened to 2.28
percentage points from 2.07 percentage points on July 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
