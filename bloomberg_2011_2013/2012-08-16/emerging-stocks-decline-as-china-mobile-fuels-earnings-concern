Emerging-market stocks advanced as
U.S. building permits jumped in July to a four-year peak,
offsetting concern of declining foreign direct investment in
China, the world’s second-biggest economy.  The  MSCI Emerging Markets Index (MXEF)  climbed 0.2 percent to
975.82. Brazil’s Bovespa stock index rose to a three-month high
as a surprise increase in retail sales buoyed gains for
homebuilder  PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos & Participacoes. (PDGR3)  China
Mobile, the biggest phone company by subscribers, fell the most
in 12 months as profit growth slowed to the weakest pace in at
least 13 years.  Building permits, a proxy for future construction, rose to
an 812,000 pace last month, the most since August 2008, the
Commerce Department said. Retail sales in Brazil jumped more
than economists expected in June. Investment in China declined
8.7 percent in July to the lowest level in two years, signaling
reduced confidence that economic growth will accelerate. Premier
 Wen Jiabao  said downward pressure on economy remained relatively
large.  “Every significant data point gives you a state of play on
the world’s largest economy and that obviously plays through to
emerging market assets,”  David Semple , who helps oversee about
$33 billion as director of international equity at Van Eck
Global, said by phone from New York. “People had set themselves
up for even worse news from China. There are some glimmers of
hope.”  EM ETF Gains  The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index exchange-traded
fund, the  ETF (EEM)  tracking developing-nation shares, climbed 0.9
percent. The Chicago Board Options Exchange Emerging Markets ETF
Volatility Index, a measure of options prices on the fund and
expectations of price swings, was unchanged at 21.62.  The Bovespa gained 2.2 percent, the highest since May 10,
with PDG Realty surging 10 percent.  Braskem SA (BRKM5) , Latin America’s
largest petrochemicals maker advanced 7.5 percent.  Retail sales volume in Brazil climbed 1.5 percent, compared
with a drop of 0.8 percent in May and the biggest rise since a
3.2 percent jump in January, the national statistics agency said
today in Rio de Janeiro. The median forecast of 38 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 0.3 percent decline.  Building permits in the U.S. rose, indicating the industry
will keep improving in the second half of the year, Commerce
Department figures showed today in Washington. Building
applications in the West soared 54 percent over the past 12
months, the biggest year-to-year jump since December 1986. New-
home construction fell 1.1 percent to a 746,000 annual rate from
June’s 754,000 pace. The median estimate of 79 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News called for 756,000.  Outlook Cut  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  and the BSE India
Sensitive Index slid 0.4 percent. The MSCI Emerging Markets
Index had rallied 10 percent from this year’s low on June 4.
 Jonathan Garner , the chief Asia and emerging-market strategist
at Morgan Stanley, reduced his year-end estimate for the index
by about 7 percent to 1,130 on lowered expectations for economic
growth. The new target still implies a gain of about 16 percent
from the gauge’s current level.  China Mobile lost 5 percent in Hong Kong, leading a gauge
of emerging-market phone companies to the steepest drop in three
weeks. Second-quarter net income of 34.4 billion yuan ($5.4
billion) missed the 35.6 billion yuan median analyst estimate in
a Bloomberg News survey as costs to lure customers increased.  China Yurun Food Group Ltd. (1068)  slid 10 percent, the biggest
drop in the MSCI emerging market  index (VXEEM) , after first-half profit
sank 93 percent.  Tencent Earnings  Tsingtao Brewery Co. (168) , China’s second-biggest brewery by
volume, fell 4.4 percent in Hong Kong. Net income was 1 billion
yuan in the six months ended June 30, trailing projections of
1.13 billion yuan.  Tencent (700) , China’s biggest Internet company, jumped 6.4
percent, the largest increase since Dec. 1. Second-quarter  net
income  climbed 32 percent to 3.1 billion yuan, compared with an
estimate of 3.08 billion in a Bloomberg survey.  Lenovo Group
Ltd. (992) , the world’s second-biggest maker of personal computers,
rose 6.3 percent to the highest level since June 22 after profit
beat estimates.  The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage points, to 310, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s
EMBI Global Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
