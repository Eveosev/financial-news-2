The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is likely to delay a meeting of the group’s
governors intended to discuss the selection of a new secretary
general until October, an OPEC delegate said.  The discussions were initially scheduled for the end of
this month. An exact date in October has not been determined,
said the delegate, who declined to be identified because the
talks are private. The organization supplies about 40 percent of
the world’s oil.  Ministers will make a final decision at the OPEC meeting in
December.  Saudi Arabia , the group’s biggest producer, is vying
with Iran,  Iraq  and Ecuador to replace Libya’s Abdalla el-Badri,
who will complete a second three-year term at the end of this
year, with its candidate.  Saudi Arabia nominated its former OPEC governor, Majid al- Moneef, while Iran selected Gholamhossein Nozari, a former oil
minister, Iraq, OPEC’s second-biggest producer, is backing
 Thamir Ghadhban , another former oil minister. Ecuador, the
organization’s smallest producer, nominated Oil Minister Wilson Pastor.  OPEC’s members are Algeria,  Angola , Ecuador, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
