The rand gained, snapping a five-day
losing streak, after data on U.S. housing and employment added
to signals the world’s biggest economy is stabilizing, boosting
demand for riskier assets. Bond yields fell.  South Africa’s currency gained as much as 0.4 percent and
traded 0.3 percent stronger at 8.2169 as of 4:54 p.m. in
Johannesburg, paring a 1.9 percent slump in the preceding five
days. Yields on 6.75 percent bonds due 2021 dropped two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.91 percent, the first
decline in five days.  U.S. building permits, a proxy for future construction,
rose to a 812,000 pace last month, the most since August 2008,
while jobless claims were little changed. Federal Reserve Bank
of Dallas President  Richard Fisher  repeated his view yesterday
that the economy probably won’t lapse into a recession in 2013
and that new stimulus won’t spur growth.  “Global data remains encouraging,”  John Cairns  and Josina Solomons, currency strategists at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg, said in e-mailed comments. “Our compatriot
currencies have started to adjust stronger again and the rand
should be pulled along in their wake.”  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index gained for a third day as
prices of industrial metals including copper rose.  Emerging-
market stocks  rallied. South Africa’s benchmark stock  index 
advanced, led by commodity exporters including  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
and  Anglo American Plc. (AAL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
