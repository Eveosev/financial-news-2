What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures may open 1 cent to 3 cents a bushel lower on
speculation that U.S. yields will improve after parts of the
Midwest received as much as 2 inches (5.1 centimeters) of rain
in the past week with more forecast next week,  Tim Hannagan  a
grain specialist at Alpari U.S. LLC in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel lower on
speculation that rain in the next 10 days will aid depleted
soil-moisture reserves for timely planting of winter grain in
the southern U.S. Great Plains, Hannagan said.  -- Corn futures were called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
lower as U.S. export demand eases after prices jumped 60 percent
in the past two months, Hannagan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
