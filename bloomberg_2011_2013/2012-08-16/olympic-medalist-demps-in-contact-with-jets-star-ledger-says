Jeff Demps, who won a silver medal
in the 400-meter relay at the London Olympics, is in contact
with the  New York  Jets as he pursues a career in the National
Football League, the Star-Ledger in Newark, New Jersey, reported.  Demps, 22, this week filed paperwork to join an NFL team
and hired an agent.  Demps, a running back and sprinter at the University of
Florida, went undrafted in the spring after he decided to focus
on track and field.  Demps was a college teammate of Jets back-up quarterback
 Tim Tebow  in 2008 and 2009, the newspaper reported. During his
college career, he rushed for 2,470 yards and 23 touchdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
