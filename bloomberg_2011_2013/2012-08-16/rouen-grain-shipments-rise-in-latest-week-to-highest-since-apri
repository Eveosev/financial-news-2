for wheat from  Africa  and a barley shipment to  Saudi Arabia .  Cargoes jumped to 144,942 metric tons between Aug. 9 and
Aug. 15 from 56,425 tons a week earlier, the  Seine River port 
wrote in an e-mailed report today.  Shipments in the week included 92,438 tons of wheat and
52,504 tons of barley. Algeria was the biggest destination with
52,500 tons of soft wheat, followed by Saudi Arabia with 44,000
