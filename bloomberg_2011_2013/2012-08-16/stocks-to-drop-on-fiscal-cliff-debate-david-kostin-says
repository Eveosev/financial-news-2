A possible stalemate around U.S.
fiscal tightening and a slowing economy will pull stocks down
this year, even as equities may gain in the longer term, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.’s chief U.S. equity strategist said.  “The uncertainty that is very significant relating to the
fiscal cliff and the budget issues and the  tax policy  for next
year are unlikely to get resolved in the very near term, and I
think that is what’s weighing on the market,” New York-based
David Kostin said in a radio interview today on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with Tom Keene. Still, “if you are looking where
you are buying the market now, on a long term basis, it is
attractive.”  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has gained 10 percent since
June 1, heading for a 12 percent advance in 2012, as European
Central bank President  Mario Draghi  pledged to do everything
that is needed to underpin the euro-union economy. The gains
came even as  Europe ’s debt crisis remains unresolved and U.S.
lawmakers disagree on fiscal policy changes for the start of
next year.  The U.S. equities gauge is less than 10 points away from a
four-year high of 1,419.04 reached on April 2. The rally has
pushed the  S&P 500  to trade at a  ratio  of 13.7 times its
members’ estimated earnings, from 12.2 times in June.  Kostin forecasts the S&P 500 may end 2012 at 1,250, an 11
percent drop from yesterday’s close at 1,405.53.  The so-called fiscal cliff in the U.S. is “not something
that’s been focused on in the last few weeks as the response has
been to the ECB and some of the positive developments there,”
he said. “That has allowed the multiple to rise.”  Kostin said equities may still return investors an average
of 8 percent a year in the next decade.  U.S. stocks advanced today, sending the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index toward the highest level since April, as building
permits jumped in July to a four-year peak. The S&P 500 rose 0.3
percent to 1,409.34 at 10:46 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  added 0.3 percent, to 13,198.85.  To contact the reporters on this story:
