Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. said a
proposed settlement with  OfficeMax Inc. (OMX)  would cut claims against
the defunct investment bank by $400 million, to about half of
the original claim, according to a federal court filing in
Manhattan.  OfficeMax, which announced the deal separately today,
received an $817.5-million Lehman- backed note in connection
with a 2004 timberlands sale. Lehman is trying to cut disputed
claims to improve its payments to the remaining creditors. The
settlement needs a bankruptcy judgeâ€™s approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
