Canadian  factory sales  fell in June,
the fourth decline in six months, as petroleum and coal were
diminished by lower prices and refinery shutdowns.  Sales fell 0.4 percent to C$48.9 billion ($49.5 billion),
Statistics  Canada  said today in Ottawa, while economists in a
Bloomberg News  survey  with 18 responses forecast a 0.3 percent
gain. The agency today also said May sales were unchanged,
compared with its earlier reading of a 0.4 percent decrease.  Canada is in the slowest export recovery since World War II
because of weak global demand and the drag of a  currency trading 
near parity with the  U.S. dollar , the  Bank of Canada   said  last
month. Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said yesterday the economy
is operating below its potential because of challenges abroad
such as  Europe ’s debt crisis, a weak recovery in the U.S. and
slowing growth in  emerging markets .  “The manufacturing sector has struggled this year, and
will continue to do so over the balance of the year as the
global growth backdrop is expected to remain subdued,” said
Mazen Issa, Canada macro strategist at TD Securities in Toronto.  Sales of petroleum and coal products fell 10.6 percent to
C$5.76 billion in June, and have dropped 23 percent since a peak
in March, Statistics Canada said. Excluding that industry sales
rose 1.1 percent in June.  The price of Western Canada Select oil dropped 47 percent
between a peak on May 1 and June 28, when it reached $49.69 a
barrel, the lowest since September 2010.  Price Changes  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industry’s contribution to economic growth, factory sales rose
0.1 percent in June,  Statistics Canada  said. Sales rose in 12 of
21  categories  tracked by Statistics Canada, accounting for 60
percent of production.  Transportation equipment sales rose 1.7 percent to C$9.20
billion, the highest since November 2007. Motor vehicle sales
rose for the 11th time in 12 months in June, posting a 0.7
percent gain.  Canada’s dollar rose 0.1 percent to 98.80 cents per U.S.
dollar at 11:57 a.m. in Toronto, the strongest level since May
4. One Canadian dollar buys $1.0122. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Canadian government bond was unchanged at 1.95 percent.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  said July 24 it will raise production of
Lexus RX sports-utility vehicles at one of its Canadian plants
to counter the effects of a rising yen.  Asia ’s largest automaker
plans to invest C$100 million and add about 400 jobs at its
Cambridge, Ontario, plant, increasing RX capacity by 30,000
vehicles annually to 104,000 by 2014, the Toyota City, Japan-
based automaker said.  Sales excluding motor vehicles and parts decreased 0.6
percent to C$42.2 billion, Statistics Canada said.  Unfilled orders rose 2.2 percent to C$64.3 billion in June,
while new orders rose 1.7 percent to C$50.3 billion.  Inventories fell 1.7 percent to C$64.8 billion, with the
ratio of factory stockpiles to sales falling to 1.32 from 1.34.  To contact the reporter on this story:
