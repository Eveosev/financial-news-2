The Philippine peso fell to a seven-
week low on signs the government favors a weaker currency and
after growth in  remittances  slowed.  Government bonds  advanced.  Funds sent home by Filipinos living abroad rose 4.2 percent
in June from a year earlier, the least in 15 months, the central
bank reported yesterday. The government said this week it’s
looking at raising money in a way that won’t fuel gains in the
currency that would hurt exporters.  Overseas sales  and
remittances account for about 30 percent of the $225 billion
economy.  “The market is cognizant that the bias of the monetary
authority is for the peso to move in line with regional
currencies,” said Roland Avante, president of Philippine
Business Bank in  Manila .  The peso closed at 42.285 per dollar from 42.27 yesterday,
Tullett Prebon Plc prices showed. It fell as much as 0.3 percent
earlier to 42.43, the weakest level since June 29. The currency
has gained 3.7 percent this year, the best performance among
 Asia ’s 11 most-traded currencies. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell
six basis points to 6.50 percent.  The government is coordinating with the central bank on how
it can use the nation’s foreign-exchange reserves to pay some
overseas debt ahead of schedule, Finance Undersecretary Rosalia de Leon said yesterday. It is also considering selling bonds
targeting foreign-currency deposits onshore so as not to bring
in “additional dollars on a net basis,” she said.  Export growth slowed to 4.2 percent in June from a year
earlier, compared with 19.7 percent the previous month, official
data show.  Foreign reserves  climbed to a record $79.3 billion in
July, according to the central bank.  The yield on the 4.875 percent bonds due August 2022 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5 percent,
according to midday fixing prices at Philippine Dealing &
Exchange Corp.  To contact the reporters on this story:
