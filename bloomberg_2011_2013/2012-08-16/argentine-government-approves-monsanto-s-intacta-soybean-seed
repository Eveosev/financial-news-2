Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s largest
seed company, was authorized by Argentina to market its latest
genetically modified soybeans to farmers.  The Intacta RR2 Pro is resistant to Monsanto’s Roundup
Ready herbicide and kills insects, St. Louis-based Monsanto said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Argentine farmers for the past decade have used Monsanto
seeds from previous harvests without paying royalties. Monsanto
said earlier this week it is working on payment agreements.
Argentina is the world’s largest shipper of soy behind the U.S.
and Brazil.  Monsanto said it is still waiting for China to approve
imports of the Intacta soybean. China is the largest buyer of
the oilseed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
