Two paralyzed men can’t legally seek
assistance to end their lives, a U.K. court ruled today in a
right-to-die case.  Tony Nicklinson and another man, who wasn’t identified
during the trial, suffer from locked-in syndrome, meaning that
while they can’t speak or control their muscles, they are
mentally lucid. The men sought a court declaration that anyone
who helped them commit suicide wouldn’t be prosecuted.  Judge Roger Toulson refused the request, ruling the courts
couldn’t make such a major change to the law.  “These are matters for Parliament to decide, representing
society as a whole,” he said in a written ruling today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
