Geron Corp. (GERN) , a  Menlo Park ,
California-based biotechnology company, gained the the most in
almost two months after a report on the website Seeking Alpha
touted the company’s cancer drugs under development.  Geron rose 15 percent to $1.97 at 2:06 p.m.  New York  time
in its biggest intraday advance since June 22. The  shares  lost
38 percent over the last 12 months through yesterday.  “The next 12 months will be, in our view, the most
important in Geron’s history,” said the report on Seeking
Alpha, which is credited to Helix Investment Management. “It is
a stock that has a great deal of opportunity, but also a great
deal of risk.”  Geron has two treatments in the second of three stages of
human testing generally needed for U.S. regulatory approval.
Imetelstat is being tested for  breast cancer  and multiple
myeloma, and GRN1005 is being tested for brain tumors that
develop from breast and  lung cancer . The company ended its stem
cell research program in 2011 to cut costs.  The company ended its stem cell research program in 2011 to
cut costs and is selling its assets there.  “People are waiting for the resolution that takes
place with the regenerative medicine program,” said Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities. He said that’s “just as
important as the positive news from the oncology.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
