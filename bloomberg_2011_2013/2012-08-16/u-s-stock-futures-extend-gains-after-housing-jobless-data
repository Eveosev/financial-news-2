U.S. stock futures extended gains as
data showed the number of building permits jumped to the
highest level in four years during July while jobless claims
were little changed last week.  S&P 500 futures expiring in September rose 0.2 percent to
1,406.8 at 8:35 a.m. in  New York .  New-home construction in the U.S. fell in July, while the
number of building permits advanced, indicating the industry
will keep improving in the second half of the year.  Starts fell 1.1 percent to a 746,000 annual rate from
June’s 754,000 pace, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate of 79 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News called for 756,000. Building permits, a proxy for
future construction, rose to an 812,000 pace, the most since
August 2008.  Jobless claims climbed by 2,000 to 366,000 in the week
ended Aug. 11, Labor Department figures showed. The median
forecast of 45 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for
an increase to 365,000. The four-week moving average, a less
volatile measure, dropped to 363,750, the fewest since the week
ended March 31.  The  S&P 500  added 0.1 percent yesterday as investors
weighed manufacturing data for clues on whether the  Federal
Reserve  will move to stimulate the economy. The index has
fluctuated around 1,400 for the past seven trading sessions,
with intraday price movement averaging 0.6 percent, the smallest
fluctuation over a comparable period since January 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Trading volume and volatility have dropped as vacationing
traders awaited policy clues from the Fed’s summit at the end of
the month and the European Central Bank meeting in September.
The index has rallied 10 percent from a five-month low on June 1
amid speculation global central banks will introduce further
stimulus measures.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
