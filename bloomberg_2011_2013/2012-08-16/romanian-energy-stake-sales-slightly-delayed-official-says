Romania agreed with the
 International Monetary Fund  to “slightly delay” the deadlines
to start the stake sales in energy companies, said Alexandru Sandulescu, an Economy Ministry official.  “The deadlines have slipped slightly from the initial
terms,” Sandulescu said in an interview in Bucharest today. He
declined to give the individual deadlines for the stake sales.  The country had planned to sell a 15 percent stake in
natural-gas producer Romgaz SA by mid-September, a 10 percent
stake in hydropower generator Hidroelectrica SA by mid-October
and another 10 percent stake in nuclear power operator
Nuclearelectrica SA by the end of the year, according to a
 letter of intent  to the IMF published in June.  The IMF said on Aug. 14 that the eastern European country
must offer for sale by September a 15 percent stake in utility
Transgaz SA and a majority stake in unprofitable chemical
company Oltchim SA to secure the approval of the lender’s board
of directors necessary to unlock a tranche under a precautionary
loan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
