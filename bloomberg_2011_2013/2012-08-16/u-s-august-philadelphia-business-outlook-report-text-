The following is the text of the
Philadelphia area manufacturing activity from the  Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .  Aug-12  Firms responding to the August Business Outlook Survey continued
to report weakness in overall business conditions.  The survey’s
indicators for general activity and new orders remained negative
for the fourth consecutive month, but both increased slightly
from July. Firms also reported slight overall declines in
employment and shorter work hours this month. Indicators of
expected activity over the next six months remained positive but
moderated for the second consecutive month.  Indicators Suggest Continued Weakness
The survey’s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the
diffusion index of current activity, increased 6 points, to a
reading of -7.1.  This marks the fourth consecutive negative
reading for the index but also its highest reading since May.
Nearly 30 percent of firms reported declines in activity this
month, exceeding the 22 percent that reported increases. Indexes
for new orders and shipments remained negative. The new orders
index improved one point, while the shipments index fell 3
points.  Labor market conditions at the reporting firms deteriorated
slightly this month. The current employment index, at -8.6,
remained near its reading in the previous month. The percent of
firms reporting decreases in employment (15 percent) exceeded
the percent reporting increases (7 percent). Firms also
indicated fewer hours worked this month: The average workweek
index increased 3 points but posted its fifth consecutive
negative reading.  Price Indexes for Output Near Steady
Indexes for prices paid and prices received both increased from
their readings in July.  The prices paid index increased from
3.7 to 11.2. The percentage of firms reporting higher input
prices was 26 percent; 19 percent reported higher prices last
month. Fifteen percent of the firms reported declines in input
prices. With respect to their own manufactured goods, however,
firms reported near-steady prices. While the percentage
reporting an increase in product prices (13 percent) was
slightly higher than the percentage reporting a decrease (10
percent), 73 percent reported steady prices. The prices received
index edged up slightly, from to 1.6 to 2.8.  Six-Month Indicators Moderate Most of the survey’s future
indicators deteriorated from their readings in July but still
suggest that firms are expecting growth over the next six
months. The future general activity index decreased slightly,
from 19.3 to 12.5. The percentage of firms expecting increases
in activity over the next six months (35 percent) remains higher
than the percentage expecting decreases (23 percent). The
indexes for future new orders and shipments remained positive
but also fell, decreasing 8 and 7 points, respectively. The
future employment index was virtually unchanged, with the share
of firms expecting to increase em-ployment (20 percent) greater
than the share expecting to decrease employment (9 percent).  In special questions this month, firms were asked about the
importance of seasonal factors in production. About 43 percent
of firms indicated that seasonal factors have a significant
influence on monthly production levels. Over 32 percent of the
firms scheduled shutdowns or slowdowns during July and August
this year, only slightly more than in the previous year when the
same question was asked. But, on balance, the effects of
shutdowns on production were not particularly unusual this year:
The number of firms indicating that production decreases were
greater than usual during July and August was only slightly
lower than the number indicating that production decreases were
less than usual.  Summary
The August Business Outlook Survey suggests that firms in the
region’s manufacturing sector are continuing to experience
weaker overall activity. More firms reported declines in new
orders, shipments, and employment than reported increases.
Prices of firms’ manufactured goods were near steady this month,
although input prices edged slightly higher. The outlook, while
not as optimistic as last month, suggests that firms still
believe that activity will increase from current levels over the
next six months.  Special Questions (August 2012)  1) How important are seasonal factors in your monthly production
