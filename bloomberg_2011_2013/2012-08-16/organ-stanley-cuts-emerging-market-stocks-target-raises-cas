Morgan Stanley (MS)  cut its 2012 forecast
for  emerging-market stocks  amid concern the global economy will
grow less than estimated and after the benchmark gauge rallied
as much as 11 percent from this year’s low in June.  Morgan Stanley reduced its year-end estimate for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index by 7 percent to 1,130, compared with
1,210 previously. The target still implies a gain of about 16
percent from the current level. The brokerage also cut its
targets for the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index by 6
percent to 500, and the Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index by 9
percent to 12,200.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index  rose  to a three-month high
of 979.28 on Aug. 9, an increase of about 11 percent from the
gauge’s June 4 low, amid optimism that central banks will
introduce new stimulus measures. The gauge fell 0.1 percent to
973.08 as of 1:50 p.m. in  Hong Kong  today.  “We take some profits after the recent rally and scale
back our fully invested overweight equities position, raising
cash from zero to 4 percent,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by
 Jonathan Garner  wrote in a report today. The brokerage recently
cut its 2012 and 2013 growth estimates for China and South Korea
along with major advanced and emerging economies.  The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has advanced 6.2 percent
this year, compared with an 8.1 percent gain by the  MSCI World
Index (MXWO)  of developed countries. The emerging-markets gauge trades
at 10.8 times estimated earnings, compared with 13 for the
developed-nations measure, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Morgan Stanley this week cut its 2012 growth forecast for
China to 8 percent from 8.5 percent previously, and 2013
estimate to 8.6 percent from 9.0 percent, citing stronger
“headwinds” from external demand. It also lowered its 2012
growth estimate for  South Korea  to 2.8 percent from 3.2 percent.  Europe, Food Risk  Government data last week showed that Chinese exports grew
1 percent in July, missing the 8 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Foreign direct investment in
China dropped 8.7 percent last month from a year earlier to
$7.58 billion, the Ministry of Commerce said today in Beijing.  Morgan Stanley said it’s concerned about “event risk” in
September as  Germany ’s  Constitutional Court  is set to rule on
the future European bailout fund on Sept. 12 as well as rising
risks from global food prices. The 21 nations in the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index send about 30 percent of their exports to
the European Union on average, data compiled by the World Trade
Organization show.  A global  food  crisis may “hit us very soon” as a drought
ravages corn crops in the U.S., the world’s largest grower, the
 International Food Policy Research Institute  said. The price of
corn, used in everything from food to livestock feed to
sweeteners, surged to a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
