Manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region contracted in August for a fourth consecutive month as
orders and employment declined.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
 index  improved to minus 7.1 in August from minus 12.9 the
previous month. Economists forecast the gauge would climb to
minus 5, according to the  median estimate  in a Bloomberg survey.
A reading of zero is the dividing point between contraction and
expansion in the area covering eastern  Pennsylvania , southern
 New Jersey  and  Delaware .  Today’s report is in line with figures from The  Federal
Reserve Bank of New York  earlier this week that showed
manufacturing contracting for the first time in 10 months.
Slowing demand from  Europe  to  China  and cutbacks in business
investment in new equipment may be hurting U.S. factories even
as American household spending holds up.  “The pace of growth is still unimpressive overall,” said
Sean Incremona, senior economist at 4Cast Inc. in New York
before the report. “Externally there are some headwinds with
pretty soft global conditions. We think that business
investments are pretty tame in 2012 so that is restricting
manufacturing from a domestic standpoint as well.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey from 56 economists
surveyed ranged from minus 17.9 to 5.  S&P 500  Stocks were little changed after the report, trimming
earlier gains. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was at 1,405.96
at 10:20 a.m. in  New York , up less than 0.1 percent from
yesterday’s close.  The Philadelphia Fed’s employment gauge fell to minus 8.6
in August, the lowest level since September 2009, from minus 8.4
in July.  New orders dropped at a slower pace as the measure improved
to minus 5.5 from minus 6.9 the previous period. The shipments
index dropped to minus 11.3 from minus 8.6.  The Philadelphia Fed’s report also showed inflation picked
up. The bank’s gauge of price paid climbed to 11.2 from 3.7. The
measure of prices received advanced to 2.8 from 1.6.  Individual measures in the index don’t contribute to the
headline reading, so some economists consider it a gauge of
sentiment among manufacturers.  The region’s manufacturers were less optimistic about the
future. The index of the outlook for six months from now fell to
12.5, the lowest level in a year, from 19.3 in July.  Economists monitor the New York and Philadelphia Fed
factory reports for clues about the  Institute for Supply
Management ’s report on U.S. manufacturing. The New York Fed’s
general economic index fell to minus 5.9 this month from 7.4 in
July. The national ISM factory data will be released on Sept. 4.  Manufacturing makes up 12 percent of the  U.S. economy .  To contact the reporter on this story:
