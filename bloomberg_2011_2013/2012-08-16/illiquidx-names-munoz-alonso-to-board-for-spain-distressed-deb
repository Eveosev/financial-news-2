IlliquidX LLP, a London-based
distressed debt trading platform, said it appointed Ignacio
Munoz-Alonso to its advisory board as it expands in  Spain .  Munoz-Alonso is also chief executive officer of London-
based asset manager Addax Capital LLP. Before that he was head
of European corporate and investment banking at  Banco Bilbao
Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) , IlliquidX said today in a statement.  “We believe the Spanish distressed  debt market  has opened
an unusual window of opportunity where much improved investor
sentiment is meeting the absolute requirement for local banks to
offload large portions of distressed debt at deeply discounted
prices,” IlliquidX Chief Executive Officer Celestino Amore said
in the statement.  The firm, founded in 2009, provides pricing and trading
services for buyers and sellers of distressed assets.  Spanish banks’ bad loans jumped to 8.95 percent of their
total lending in May, an 18-year high, as 3.1 billion euros
($3.8 billion) of lending soured, Bank of Spain said on July 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
