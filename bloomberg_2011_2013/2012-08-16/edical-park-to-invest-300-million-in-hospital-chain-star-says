Medical Park, a Turkish hospital
operator thatâ€™s 40 percent-owned by  Carlyle Group LP (CG) , plans to
invest $300 million over two years to set up a hospital chain in
 Turkey ,  Star  reported, citing Chairman Muharrem Usta.  The company will open two hospitals in Istanbul and one
each in Ankara and Izmir, under the Liv Hospital brand, and will
sell a stake to help finance the investment, the newspaper cited
Usta as saying.  Medical Park hopes the hospitals will earn $100 million of
revenue from health tourism, Star said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
