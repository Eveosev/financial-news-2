Monsanto Co. (MON)  was authorized by
Argentina’s Agriculture Ministry to market its Intacta RR2 Pro
soybean seed, Clarin  reported , citing government officials it
didn’t name.  The genetically modified seed is resistant to Monsanto’s
glyphosate herbicide and can make the oilseeds more resistant to
insects, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said.  The seed is already being marketed in Brazil, the U.S. and
Paraguay, Clarin said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
