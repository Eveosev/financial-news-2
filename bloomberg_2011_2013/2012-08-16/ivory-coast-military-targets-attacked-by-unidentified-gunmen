Unidentified gunmen opened fire on a
military checkpoint and released more than 150 prisoners in a
southern town in  Ivory Coast  amid a surge of attacks on the West
African nation’s security forces this month.  Three attackers were found dead after gunfire from
automatic weapons was heard throughout the night in Dabou, 50
kilometers (31 miles) west of the commercial capital, Abidjan,
Ousmane Coulibaly, a military official, said by phone today. The
gunmen broke down the doors of the local prison during the
assault, allowing the prisoners to escape, he said.  The violence is extending a decade of conflict in the
world’s biggest cocoa producer, that was sparked by a military
mutiny in 2002 and culminated in a crisis that followed a
November 2010 presidential election, which left more than 3,000
people dead.  A post in western Ivory Coast near the border with Liberia
came under fire on Aug. 13., less than a week after at 10
soldiers were killed in two separate attacks on an army base and
a police station in Abidjan.  Paul Koffi Koffi, minister delegate for defense, blamed
last week’s attacks on supporters of ex-President  Laurent
Gbagbo , who is being held by the  International Criminal Court  in
The Hague awaiting trial on charges of  war crimes .  To contact the reporters on this story:
