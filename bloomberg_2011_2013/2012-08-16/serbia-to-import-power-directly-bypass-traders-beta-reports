Serbia will cut out electricity
traders in future imports as the government estimates how much
power the country will need this year amid drought that reduced
production at hydro plants, Beta  news agency  reported, citing
the energy minister.  The state will also revise practices of Elektroprivreda
Srbije, the government-owned power monopoly, and possibly change
part of its management in order to improve efficiency, the
newswire quoted Zorana Mihajlovic as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
