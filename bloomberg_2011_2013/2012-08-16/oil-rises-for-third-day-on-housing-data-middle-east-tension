Oil climbed above $95 a barrel for
the first time in three months as U.S. building permits reached
a four-year high and equities advanced, adding to optimism that
faster economic growth will boost demand.  Prices gained for a third day after the Commerce Department
reported the  permits  increased to an 812,000 annual pace in
July, the most since August 2008. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index rose to the highest level since April.  “Evidence is accumulating that the housing market has
bottomed out and is on the way up,” said  Michael Lynch ,
president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in Winchester,
Massachusetts. “That would be such a huge gain for the  U.S.
economy  and it’s going to be bullish for the oil market.”  Oil for September delivery increased $1.27, or 1.3 percent,
to settle at $95.60 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price reached $95.75, the highest intraday level
since May 14.  Brent crude  for September settlement gained 65 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $116.90 on the London-based ICE Futures Europe
exchange. The contract expired today. The more actively traded
October contract rose 96 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $115.27.  Brent’s premium to New York oil fell to $21.30 from
yesterday’s $21.92, the most since October.  Housing Permits  July’s housing permits, a proxy for future construction,
beat the 769,000 pace forecast by economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The Commerce Department data also showed housing
starts fell 1.1 percent to a 746,000 annual rate from June’s
754,000 pace.  Construction company leaders are turning less pessimistic.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo index of
builder  confidence  climbed in August to the highest level in
more than five years, the Washington-based group said yesterday.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed as much as 0.7
percent to the highest intraday level since April 3. The S&P’s
GSCI Index of 24 commodities also rose.  The 120-day  correlation  of the daily changes of the S&P
index and Nymex oil futures rose to 66.7 percent, the strongest
level since it reached 67 percent in July 2010, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Every  fund manager  looks for correlation, and we cannot
deny that there is a strong correlation between oil and the
equity market,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, chief market strategist
and founder of Iitrader.com in Chicago. “Both markets are
reaching highs together.”  Euro Strengthens  Oil also gained as the euro strengthened as much as 0.7
percent against the dollar to $1.2373 as German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  reiterated her commitment to working with the
 European Central Bank  to resolve the region’s financial turmoil.  A stronger euro and weaker dollar increase oil’s appeal as
an investment alternative.  Crude has advanced 2.9 percent this week on declining
inventories and rising demand. Stockpiles dropped 3.7 million
barrels last week and oil use reached a nine-month high, the
Energy Department said.  “The fundamental data was bullish,” said  Chris Barber , a
senior analyst at Energy Security Analysis Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. “All of this stuff and the housing number
together are creating a positive outlook for investors.”  Mideast Tension  Oil has increased 8.6 percent in August, helped by concern
that  Middle East  tension will disrupt supplies from a region
that produces 33 percent of global output.  Michael Oren ,
Israel’s U.S. ambassador, said yesterday at a Bloomberg
Government breakfast in Washington that his country would strike
to delay Iran’s ability to make nuclear weapons for a few years.  “Those types of statements from the ambassador have the
potential to impact  oil prices  significantly on any given day,”
Barber said.  Israeli President  Shimon Peres  called for the U.S. to work
together to solve the Iran nuclear crisis. Peres said in an
interview broadcast on Channel 2 television today that he
doubted Israel would launch a strike at  Iran’s nuclear program 
before the U.S. presidential election in November.  The Middle East held 79 percent of proved reserves as of
last year, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World
Energy, released in June. Iran produced 2.8 million barrels a
day in July, U.S. Energy Department  data  show,  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 462,452
contracts as of 3:07 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 746,813
contracts yesterday, the most since June 29. Open interest was
1.5 million, the most since May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
