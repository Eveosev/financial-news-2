Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  Chief Executive
Officer  Michael O’Leary  defended the airline over accusations
following three emergency landings in  Spain ,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported.  The aircraft were sufficiently fueled according to European
regulations and had to circle over Valencia for more than an
hour, O’Leary told the newspaper. Ryanair operates like every
other European airline and nobody was in danger, he said.  Spain’s aviation-safety agency said Aug. 14 it was probing
three emergency landings carried out by Ryanair, Europe’s
biggest discount carrier, at Valencia’s airport. Aena, Spain’s
airport operator, reported the emergency landings, which were
made because the aircrafts’ fuel supplies were dwindling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
