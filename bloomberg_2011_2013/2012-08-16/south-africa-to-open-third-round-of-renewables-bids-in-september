South Africa  plans to open bidding
for a third round of renewable-energy projects next month,
Energy Department Director-General Nelisiwe Magubane said.  The government is confident that bidders were successful in
the first round, which comprises 28 projects costing 46 billion
rand and was announced in December, will reach financial close
by the end of August, she told reporters today in Johannesburg.
The deadline for financing was June 30.  “Banks have been queueing to fund the program,” Magubane
said. “The bidders are not struggling with funding, the delays
have been on the government’s side.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
