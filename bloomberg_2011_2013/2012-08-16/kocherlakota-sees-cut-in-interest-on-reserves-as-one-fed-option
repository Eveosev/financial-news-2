President Narayana Kocherlakota said a reduction in the  interest
rate  paid on reserves banks keep with the Fed is one policy tool
available should the economy need more stimulus.  “There is some room to reduce that further to incentivize
banks to lend,” Kocherlakota said today in response to an
audience question after a speech in Minot, North Dakota. “This
should be something that we think about” if further easing
becomes necessary, even though a cut would have only “minimal
effects on the economy,” he said.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  has identified other ways to
stimulate the slowing U.S. economy, including buying more bonds
and altering the Fed’s communications on the outlook for
interest rates.  Unemployment is “quite elevated” while inflation has been
running below the central bank’s target, Kocherlakota said
today.  The policy-setting  Federal Open Market Committee , on which
the district bank chief does not vote this year, is next
scheduled to meet Sept. 12-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
