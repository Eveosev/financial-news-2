Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc. (KW)  said
today it acquired with investment partners its first office
building in Dublin for 15 million euros ($19 million.)  “We believe that a combination of improving demand driven
mainly by international tenants and the lack of any significant
development pipeline in the city, will lead to a strong level of
rental growth over the next several years,” said Peter Collins,
Managing Director of Kennedy Wilson Europe in a statement today.  Beverly Hills , California-based Kennedy Wilson owns 50
percent of the property, which is being bought without debt
financing, the company said. The 45,000-square foot office
building in south Dublin is 100 percent leased and generated net
operating income of about 2.2 million euros in the past twelve
months, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
