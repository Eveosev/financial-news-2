Gold imports by  India , the world’s
largest bullion buyer, slumped 56 percent in the second quarter
after record prices discouraged jewelry buyers and investors,
according to the World Gold Council.  Purchases plunged to 131 metric tons in the three months
ended June 30 from 301 tons a year earlier, the London-based
producer funded group said in a report today. Jewelry demand
dropped 30 percent to 124.8 tons, while purchases of coins and
bars for investment slid 51 percent to 56.5 tons, it said.  Bullion futures in India rallied to a record last quarter
even as global prices declined 4.3 percent, as the local
currency slumped to an all-time low against the dollar. Global
gold demand fell 7.1 percent in the April-June period to 990
tons because of higher prices and concerns about economic
growth, the council said.  “Slowing GDP growth, record high local gold prices caused
by currency fluctuations, stubborn domestic inflation, high
 interest rates , and fears of a poor monsoon season, all
contributed,” the council said. “However, there will be
considerable latent demand for gold, particularly in light of
the weak first half,” the council said.  The  Indian rupee  declined to a record of 57.3275 per
dollar on June 22, making imports costlier. Jewelers held a
strike in March and April to protest government taxes on
imports, further trimming demand, the council said.  Bullion for immediate delivery was little changed at
$1,604.55 an ounce at 8:55 a.m. in Mumbai. The October-delivery
contract declined 0.2 percent to 30,005 rupees ($536) per 10
grams on the Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd. yesterday.  Weak Monsoon  Below-average monsoon rain this year has stoked concerns
about rural jewelry demand, given people’s dependence on farming
and the potential impact of a poor harvest on income levels, the
council said.  The monsoon rains, which account for 70 percent of the
country’s rainfall, were 15 percent below a 50-year average, the
worst in three years, the  India Meteorological Department  said
yesterday. Rural areas represent about 60 percent of gold buying
in India, according to UBS AG.  Gold consumption in India fell 7 percent to 933.4 tons in
2011, while imports were a record 969 tons, according to the
council.  “Demand should emerge during the main fourth-quarter
wedding season and November’s Diwali festival, a key traditional
gold buying occasion in the Hindu calendar,” the council said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
