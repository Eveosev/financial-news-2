KenolKobil Ltd. (KNOC) , a Kenya-based fuel
retailer with operations in nine African nations, declined the
most in five weeks on investor concerns about a delay in
announcing an offer price to buy out minority shareholders.  The shares fell 2.6 percent to 15.05 shillings by 2:34 p.m.
in the capital, Nairobi. A close at this level would be the
lowest since July 17.  “Investors are anxious waiting for the offer price so that
they can move on,” Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-
based Standard Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview
today.  KenolKobil resumed trading on the Nairobi Securities
Exchange on June 20, following a six-week suspension after the
company said on May 8 its main shareholders agreed to sell their
stake to Puma Energy BV, a unit of Trafigura Beheer BV. Puma
will make an offer to buy 100 percent of KenolKobil after due
diligence is completed, the Kenyan company said on May 15.  Victoria Dix, head of media relations at Geneva-based Puma
Energy, did not immediately respond to e-mailed questions about
the status of the transaction.  The stock has gained 52 percent this year and is the
eighth-best performer on the Nairobi Securities Exchange All
Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
