The zloty gained to the strongest
level in four days against the euro, erasing earlier declines,
before a report that will probably show the  U.S. economy  is
recovering.  Poland’s currency gained 0.2 percent to 4.0777 per euro at
1:40 p.m. in Warsaw, the strongest on a closing basis since Aug.
10. Local markets were closed yesterday for Assumption Day. The
yield on 10-year zloty  bonds  rose three basis points to 5.01
percent, a three-week high.  The zloty has weakened 1 percent since Aug. 6, the second-
biggest loss among more than 20 emerging-market currencies,
after the current-account deficit widened and an economic
adviser to Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the government may
cuts its growth forecast. A report today may show the housing
market is stabilizing in the world’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story
