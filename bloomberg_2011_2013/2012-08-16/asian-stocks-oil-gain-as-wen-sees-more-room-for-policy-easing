Stocks jumped, sending the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level in four months, as  Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO) ’s sales topped estimates, U.S. building permits
surged and speculation grew that Spain will get a bailout.
Commodities rallied and the euro strengthened.  The  S&P 500  rose 0.7 percent to 1,415.51 at 4 p.m. in  New
York , its highest  closing level  since April 2. Wheat jumped 1.8
percent and oil topped $95 a barrel for the first time in three
months to lead the S&P GSCI Index of commodities to the highest
level since May. The euro added 0.6 percent to $1.2357, halting
a two-day slump. Spain’s bonds climbed and the IBEX-35  stock
index  surged 4.1 percent on bets a bailout will pave the way for
policy makers to buy the nation’s debt.  Cisco surged 9.6 percent to lead technology shares to the
best gain among 10 groups in the S&P 500. An index of builders
surged to a four-year high as permits, a proxy for future
construction, rose to an 812,000 pace, the most since August
2008, the Commerce Department said. A person familiar with the
matter said Spain is about to get an emergency disbursement from
a 100 billion-euro ($123 billion) package, while German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel  pledged to hold the euro area together.  Today’s U.S. data are “confirmatory that things are really
improving,”  Greg Peterson , director of investment research at
Ballentine Partners LLC in Waltham, Massachusetts, which has
about $4 billion in assets, said in a phone interview.
“American corporations are in great shape,” he said, and
“everybody is seeing an emerging good story coming out of
Europe.”  Homebuilders Rally  The  S&P 500 Total Return index , which assumes dividends are
reinvested back into the gauge’s 500 stocks, climbed to a record
today even as the regular S&P 500 remained almost 10 percent
below its peak in 2007.  The S&P 500 is up almost 13 percent this year and
approaching the four-year high of 1,419.04 reached on April 2.
An S&P gauge of 11 homebuilders surged 4.4 percent today and has
rallied 60 percent in 2012 on optimism the industry is
rebounding. While building permits increased, housing starts
fell. Another report showed initial jobless claims rose by 2,000
to 366,000 last week.  Cisco, Home Depot Inc. and Microsoft Corp. led gains in 23
of 30 stocks in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , sending the
gauge up 85.33 points to 13,250.11, its highest close since May
2.  Cisco surged the most in a year after job cuts kept costs
in check and price reductions attracted customers. Sears
Holdings Corp. climbed 6.5 percent after its loss narrowed.
Facebook Inc. dropped 6.3 percent to $19.87, the lowest closing
price since its initial public offering in May, as 271.1 million
of its shares were allowed to trade following the end of a post-
IPO lockup. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. fell 3.1 percent after posting
second-quarter sales that trailed analysts’ estimates.  Fisher’s Stance  The  S&P 500 index (SPX)  had hovered around 1,400 for the previous
 seven trading sessions  as investors awaited the Fed’s summit in
 Jackson Hole , Wyoming, at the end of the month. Intraday price
movements in the index averaged 0.6 percent, the smallest
fluctuations over a comparable period since January 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Daily swings in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average averaged 0.7 percent from Aug. 6
through yesterday, the narrowest since March, the data show.  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President  Richard Fisher 
repeated his view yesterday that the economy probably won’t
lapse into a recession in 2013 and that new stimulus won’t spur
growth. Fisher in 2011 dissented twice against moves to push
down long-term rates and to keep the benchmark U.S. interest
rate near zero until at least mid-2013. He voted five times in
2008 in favor of tighter policy. This year he isn’t a voting
member of the  Federal Open Market Committee .  European Markets  More than two stocks rose for each that declined in the
 Stoxx 600. (SXXP)   Novozymes A/S (NZYMB)  jumped 4.8 percent after reporting
second-quarter net income that exceeded analysts’ estimates.
Telekom Austria NV tumbled 5.6 percent after t he phone company 
that is partly owned by  Carlos Slim ’s America Movil SAB cut its
profit and sales forecast for 2012.  The yield on Spain’s 10-year bonds fell for a fourth day,
losing 12 basis points to 6.52 percent. The rate on benchmark
German bunds dropped four basis points to 1.53 percent, while
the yield on similar-maturity Italian bonds rose two basis
points to 5.79 percent. Ten-year U.S. Treasury rates added two
basis points to 1.83 percent, the highest since May.  Germany’s Merkel said the  European Central Bank ’s
insistence on conditionality in return for help to lower
borrowing costs in indebted countries matches Germany’s
priorities to end the crisis in the euro region.  “The ECB is completely in line with what we’ve said all
along,” Merkel told reporters in Ottawa today at a joint press
conference with Canadian Prime Minister  Stephen Harper .  ‘Everything We Can’  Merkel said that time is running out to resolve the crisis
that emerged in Greece in late 2009 even as European leaders
make progress in overcome the turmoil. All the same, policy
makers in the 17-nation euro region “feel committed to do
everything we can in order maintain the common currency.”  Spain will apply for aid at a meeting of finance ministers
and central bank governors next month, allowing the ECB to buy
Spanish government debt in the secondary market once approval is
won, according to a Medley Global Advisors report Bloomberg News
obtained. Medley officials weren’t immediately available to
comment.  The euro strengthened against all 16 major peers.  “It’s all very soothing stuff that’s going on, and it’s
likely to bolster support for the euro,”  Thomas Molloy , chief
dealer at FX Solutions LLC, an online currency-trading company
in Saddle River, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. The
“Medley report, while it didn’t say anything new, it just
reminded everybody that in their view the Spaniards will
eventually ask for a bailout, and with a bailout will likely
come some ECB buying, which is likely to smack bond yields.”  Pound Strengthens  The pound appreciated 0.4 percent against the dollar after
British retail sales including auto fuel gained 0.3 percent in
July, compared with a 0.1 percent decline predicted by the media
estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The S&P GSCI gauge of 24 commodities rose 0.8 percent.
Wheat gained for a second day on speculation that demand will
increase for U.S. and European grains as dry weather reduces
supplies in Russia. Farmers in Russia, the world’s third biggest
wheat exporter last season, have harvested 27.9 million metric
tons of the grain so far this year, 17 percent less than in
2011, as yields declined, the country’s  Agriculture Ministry 
said today.  Crude oil rallied 1.3 percent to $95.60 a barrel in New
York. Coffee was down the most among commodities tracked by the
index, losing 1.9 percent, and cocoa declined 1.5 percent.  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index added 0.3 percent after
dropping as much as 0.3 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index
slid 0.4 percent after the smallest inflow of foreign direct
investment since July 2010. India’s Sensex lost 0.4 percent,
while Russia’s Micex Index added 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
