South Korea ’s five-year government
bond yields climbed to a one-month high after the nation’s
unemployment rate unexpectedly fell, suggesting the economy
remains resilient.  The jobless rate eased to a seven-month low of 3.1 percent
in July from 3.2 percent in June, Statistics Korea reported
today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey was for a rate
of 3.3 percent. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to the
highest in almost three-months after a Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
report said the Federal Reserve will next month hold off from a
third round of bond buying, known as quantitative easing, as
economic data improves. The won fell.  “After some good data this week, sentiment for safer
assets has weakened,” said Huh Kwan, a Seoul-based trader at
Korea Investment & Securities Co. “The Korean  bond market  is
retreating as global yields jumped on waning expectations for
more stimulus from central banks.”  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 increased 10 basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, to
3.09 percent in  Seoul , the highest level since July 11, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year debt futures were 105.63
from 105.92 on Aug. 14. Seoul’s financial markets were closed
yesterday for a public holiday.  The won weakened to 1,134.15 per dollar from 1,129.78 at
the close on Aug. 14 in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, rose to 7.34 percent from
7.18 percent before yesterday’s holiday.  “The market is taking a break, reassessing the possibility
of more global stimulus after recent economic data from the U.S.
and  Europe ,” said Kang Pan Seok, a currency strategist at Woori
Futures Co. in Seoul. “I don’t see any big swings in the
 currency markets  at the moment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
