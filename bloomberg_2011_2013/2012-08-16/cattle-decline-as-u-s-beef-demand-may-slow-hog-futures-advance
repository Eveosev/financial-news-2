Cattle futures fell the most in two
weeks on speculation that the highest beef prices since early
July will trim demand. Hogs climbed.  Wholesale beef rallied today to $1.9092 a pound, up 7.2
percent over nine sessions and the highest since July 6, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. Rising costs may hurt
demand, said  Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial
Services in  Chicago .  “It’s just going to be the old broken record of seeing
some consumer resistance at high beef prices,” Smith said by
telephone.  Cattle futures for October delivery fell 0.9 percent to
settle at $1.2555 a pound at 1 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, the biggest loss since July 31. Feeder-cattle futures
for October settlement slid 1 percent to $1.44125 a pound on the
CME.  Hog futures for October settlement rose less than 0.1
percent to 75.625 cents a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
