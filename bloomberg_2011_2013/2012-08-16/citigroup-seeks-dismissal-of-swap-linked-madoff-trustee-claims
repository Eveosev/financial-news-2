Citigroup Inc. asked a judge to
dismiss $130 million of claims by the liquidator of  Bernard
Madoff â€™s brokerage, saying the funds were received as part of a
swap transaction with a hedge-fund customer who was betting on
the performance of a feeder fund to the Ponzi scheme.   So-called safe harbor laws, devised to protect banks, stop
the Madoff trustee from undoing swap deals, the bank said in a
filing in federal court in Manhattan.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff took the Citigroup case out
of bankruptcy court, along with hundreds of other Madoff suits,
to decide what trustee Irving Picard is permitted to do under
safe-harbor law. Picard originally sued Citigroup for
$430 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
