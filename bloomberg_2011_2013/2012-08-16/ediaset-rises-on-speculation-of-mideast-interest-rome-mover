Mediaset SpA (MS)  gained the most in more
than three years on speculation investors from the Middle East
are buying the broadcaster’s shares and may seek to become the
company’s second-biggest shareholder.  The  stock  rose as much as 11.2 percent to 1.56 euros, the
biggest intraday gain since November 2008, and traded up 9.4
percent as of 1:35 p.m. in  Rome .  “There have been rumors of Arab investors entering the
company’s capital and this is moving the shares,” said Marco
Binda, a  fund manager  at Gesti-Re SGR SpA in Milan. “The rally
has been going on for a few days now.”  Even with this week’s gains, Mediaset shares are down
almost 22 percent this year and reached a record low 1.16 euros
as shares have been hurt by weak advertising revenue caused by
Italy’s deepening recession.  Mediaset, which is controlled by former Italian Prime
Minister  Silvio Berlusconi , reported last month a 65 percent
drop in second-quarter net income to 32.7 million euros. Sales
declined to 1.02 billion euros from 1.14 billion euros a year
earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
