Hajj Maher Meqdad, secretary general
of the Meqdad Family League, pledged not to attack anyone from
the  Persian Gulf , Lebanon’s official  National News Agency
reported .  Meqdad said the clan had halted all “military operations
as they caught a sufficient number of Free Syrian Army
supporters as well as a Turkish citizen,” NNA said.  Saudi Arabia , the  United Arab Emirates , Kuwait, Qatar and
Bahrain advised their nationals to leave Lebanon after
kidnapping threats were made against them following the
abduction of a member of the Meqdad family in Syria.  The call came after the extended family, which belongs
mostly to Lebanon’s Muslim Shiite community, captured 20 Syrians
and a Turk in retaliation for the abduction of the family
member, the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation reported
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
