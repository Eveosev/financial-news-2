Scotland ’s agricultural debt was
1.67 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) on May 31, up 3.5 percent
from the same time a year earlier and heading for a third
consecutive annual gain, the region’s chief statistician said.  About 89 percent of advances from banks and mortgage
companies went to owner-occupier farms, while 8 percent went to
tenant farmers and the remainder went to agricultural
contractors and livestock salesmen, according to the chief
statistician’s  report  on the government’s website. Agriculture
debt rose for a third straight year “despite difficult lending
conditions in the economy,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
