Koby Altman, an assistant men’s
basketball coach at  Columbia University  the past two seasons,
joined the Cleveland Cavaliers as pro personnel manager and will
oversee the team’s domestic scouting.  Altman, 29, will also assist General Manager Chris Grant
and Vice President of Basketball Operations David Griffin with
other player personnel-related matters, the National Basketball
Association team said in a statement.  Altman led Columbia’s developmental basketball program in
addition to his coaching responsibilities and has worked with
USA Basketball. He was operations manager for the under-17
national team that won a gold medal at the 2010 FIBA world
championship in Germany and assisted on Team USA’s 19-and-under
team in New Zealand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
