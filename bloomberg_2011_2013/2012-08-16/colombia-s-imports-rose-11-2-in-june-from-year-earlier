Colombia ’s imports rose 11.2 percent
to $5.065 billion in June compared with the same month last
year, the government statistics agency said today in a report on
its website.  Colombia posted a $190.9 million trade deficit in June,
from a $20.2 million surplus in May. The trade deficit was
greater than the median forecast of a $100 million deficit by
five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Spending on imports has been boosted by a 6.6 percent
appreciation in the Colombian peso this year, the third-biggest
gain among 170 currencies tracked by Bloomberg, boosting
spending on imports.  Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said yesterday that
the Treasury will buy “at least” $300 million as part of the
government’s effort to stem the rally, which is provoking
complaints from exporters. Central bank board member Cesar
Vallejo said earlier this week that policy makers are
considering doubling the bank’s daily dollar purchases to $40
million or extending the program beyond its scheduled end in
November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
