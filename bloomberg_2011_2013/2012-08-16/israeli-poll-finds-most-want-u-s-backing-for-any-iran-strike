A majority of Jewish Israelis oppose
an Israeli strike on  Iran ’s nuclear facilities without U.S.
cooperation, according to a poll published by the Israel
Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem policy center, and Tel Aviv
University.  The survey found that 60.7 percent of Jewish Israelis
oppose an Israeli strike without U.S. cooperation, while 75.7
percent believe that with American support such an action would
likely “succeed in stopping Iran’s nuclearization for a
significant time.” In addition, 54.3 percent said that without
such support a unilateral strike would likely fail to do so.  When asked whether President  Barack Obama  or his Republican
opponent  Mitt Romney  “assigns more importance to defending
Israel’s national interests,” 39.9 percent said Romney and 18.6
percent Obama.  The survey of 516 Israeli Jews has a margin of error of 4.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
