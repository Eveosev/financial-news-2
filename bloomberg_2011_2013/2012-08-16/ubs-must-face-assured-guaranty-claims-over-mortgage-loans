UBS AG (UBS)  must face claims in a lawsuit
brought by bond insurer  Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO) , which alleges UBS
misrepresented the risk of loans underlying $1.5 billion in
mortgage securities.  U.S. District Judge Harold Baer in Manhattan, in a decision
filed yesterday, dismissed some claims and said others will
proceed against UBS Real Estate Securities Inc.  Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. sued the UBS unit in
February, claiming UBS “materially and pervasively” breached
promises about the quality of loans backing securities for which
Assured agreed to guarantee payments to investors.  The mortgage securitizations at issue in the lawsuit
included a “massive number” of defective loans and have
defaulted at higher rates than if they had conformed to
standards UBS represented, Assured said in its complaint.  Assured’s claim for breach of mortgage representations will
proceed along with a claim that UBS obtained “falsely inflated
shadow ratings” from ratings companies, Baer said in his
decision. The judge dismissed a claim against UBS for failure to
repurchase defective loans.  Karina Byrne , a spokeswoman for Zurich-based UBS, didn’t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the suit. Ashweeta Durani, a spokeswoman for Hamilton, Bermuda-based Assured, said
the company was reviewing the decision.  The case is Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. v. UBS Real
Estate Securities Inc. 12-cv-1579, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
