Turkish  bond yields  dropped the most
in more than five months after the central bank said it may
narrow the so-called interest-rate corridor, reducing the appeal
of lira-denominated assets.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt sank 20 basis points, or
0.20 percentage point, to 7.74 percent at the close in Istanbul,
the biggest decline since March 8. The lira gained 0.1 percent
to 1.7968 per dollar, appreciating for a second day.  Turkey ’s monetary policy committee kept both ends of the
corridor unchanged and held the benchmark one-week repo rate at
5.75 percent today, in line with the forecast of all nine
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg. It may narrow the rates band -
-5.75 percent to 11.5 percent -- “gradually in the coming
period,” according to the central bank. The policy of flexible
 interest rates  was introduced in October to reign in credit
growth and control inflation.  “Although this action was expected, we are seeing a
loosening in yields because it was stated so openly,” Gizem
Oztok Altinsac, an economist at Garanti Investment, said in an
e-mailed note.  The central bank raised the proportion of lira reserves
lenders can keep in foreign exchange to 60 percent from 55
percent and in gold to 30 percent from 25 percent.  The change in  reserve requirements  may add as much as $7.3
billion to the country’s foreign exchange reserves and increase
liquidity in the market by 5.6 billion liras ($3.1 billion)  “It appears that the increased lira liquidity provided to
the system will affect the short-end of the yield curve
positively,” Ali Cakiroglu, a strategist at  HSBC Private Bank 
in Istanbul, said in an e-mailed note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
