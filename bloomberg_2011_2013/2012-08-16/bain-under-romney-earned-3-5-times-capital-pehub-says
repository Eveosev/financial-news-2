Bain Capital Partners LLC returned
3.5 times its invested capital during Republican presidential
candidate  Mitt Romney ’s 15-year tenure at the private-equity
firm, Thomson Reuters Corp.’s PeHUB reported, citing a 2011 Bain
presentation to investors.  Bain earned $6.75 billion on $1.91 billion invested in
about 150 companies from 1984 to 1999, Reuters said, citing the
presentation. Bain invested the money through seven funds, whose
net internal rates of return ranged from 13.8 percent to 66.1
percent, according to PeHUB. The Bain presentation used data
from September 2010, according to the publication.  Alex Stanton, a spokesman for Bain, wasn’t immediately
available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
