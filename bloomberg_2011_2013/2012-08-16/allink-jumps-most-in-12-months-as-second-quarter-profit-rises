AS Tallink Grupp (TAL1T)  rose by the most in
12 months after cost cuts helped the largest Baltic ferry
company report higher second-quarter profit.  The stock gained as much as 6 percent to 70.3 euro cents in
Tallinn trade, the biggest rise since last August. Tallink has
added 21 percent in the last 12 months, compared with a 1-
percent gain for its eastern European transportation peers,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tallink, which mainly ships passengers and goods between
Estonia, Finland and  Sweden , said yesterday that second-quarter
net income rose to 20 million euros ($24.6 million) from 13.6
million euros a year earlier, citing higher revenue and the
closure of its unprofitable Finland-Germany route.  To contact the reporter on this story:
