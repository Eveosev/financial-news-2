Durham’s Graham Onions took 9-67,
the best bowling figures of his career, and ran out
Nottinghamshire batsman Luke Fletcher after being released from
the England cricket squad today.  The pace bowler’s efforts at  Trent Bridge  helped dismiss
Notts for 154, in reply to Durham’s 194. Durham closed on 27-0
to lead by 67 after the second day of the County Championship
Division One match.  Onions wasn’t required for the England side playing South
Africa in the final Test at Lord’s in London.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
