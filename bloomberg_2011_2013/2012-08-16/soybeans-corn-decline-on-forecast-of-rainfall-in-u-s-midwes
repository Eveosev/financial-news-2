Wheat futures rose for a second day
on speculation that demand will increase for U.S. and European
grains as dry weather reduces supplies in  Russia .  Farmers in Russia, the world’s third biggest wheat exporter
last season, have harvested 27.9 million metric tons of the
grain so far this year, 17 percent less than in 2011, as yields
declined, the country’s  Agriculture Ministry  said today. The
harvest is 52 percent complete.  Egypt , the world’s biggest wheat
buyer, has purchased Russian wheat in its last two import
tenders, shunning U.S. and European supplies.  “It is highly likely that Russia will be out of the export
market by Christmas, and probably before then,”  Dave Norris , an
independent grain broker in Harrogate,  England , said by
telephone today. “ Europe  and the U.S. have been missing out on
export business, with Egypt buying Russian and Ukrainian wheat a
day or two ago. That competition isn’t likely to be there once
we get past Christmas.”  Wheat for December delivery rose 1.5 percent to $8.79 a
bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade at 11:23 a.m. London time,
heading for the biggest increase in a week. In Paris, November-
delivery milling wheat added 1.6 percent to 260.25 euros
($319.38) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  In 2010, wheat prices surged 47 percent in Chicago and
almost doubled in Paris after Russia’s worst drought in 50 years
spurred the country to ban grain exports for 10 months.  Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  said Aug. 8 that
there’s no reason for Russia to limit shipments this year, while
export duties are “theoretically possible” beyond 2012.
Deutsche Bank AG and INTL FCStone Inc. have warned that future
restrictions may be possible, given the recent pace of Russian
shipments.  Soybeans, Corn  Soybeans for November delivery fell 0.3 percent to $16.29 a
bushel on the Chicago exchange. The price reached a record
$16.915 on July 23 as U.S. drought damaged crops. Corn for
December delivery was little changed at $8.0475 a bushel, down
from a record $8.49 set on Aug. 10.  Showers and cooler temperatures this week will ease stress
to pod-filling soybeans and may improve yield potential, Telvent
DTN Inc. said in a report yesterday. It remains unclear how
much damaged crops can recover after severe heat and dryness
this summer, it said.  The USDA cut its corn production forecast on Aug. 10 to
10.779 billion bushels, a six-year low, while soybean output was
reduced by 12 percent to 2.69 billion bushels.  “We’re still looking at the weather event,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures Pte., said by phone from
 Singapore  today. “I don’t think that’s sufficient to ease
supply concerns.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
