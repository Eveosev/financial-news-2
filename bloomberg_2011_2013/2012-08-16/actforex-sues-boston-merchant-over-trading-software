ActForex Inc. sued Boston Merchant
Financial Ltd. for allegedly infringing copyrights in software
used for trading foreign currencies online.  In a complaint filed today in  Manhattan  federal court,
ActForex accused the Boston-based broker-dealer of
misappropriation of  trade secrets , breach of contract, tortious
interference, unfair competition, fraud and unjust enrichment.
ActForex, which is seeking damages and injunctive relief, also
said Boston Merchant poached one of its software designers.  About $1.5 trillion is traded daily in the foreign exchange
market over the counter, by phone, by fax or online. ActForex
said its main business is licensing its foreign-exchange trading
platforms to broker-dealers such as Boston Merchant, which has
been a customer since 2001.  ActForex alleges that an employee it put in charge of
customizing Boston Merchant’s software in 2008 was recruited to
“work surreptitiously” for the broker-dealer and later joined
the firm.  A phone call to Boston Merchant’s offices after business
hours wasn’t immediately returned.  The case is ActForex Inc. v. Boston Merchant Financial Ltd.
