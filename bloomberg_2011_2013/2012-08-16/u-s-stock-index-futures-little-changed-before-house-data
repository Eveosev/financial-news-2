U.S. stocks advanced, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the highest level since April, as
building permits jumped in July to a four-year peak and  Cisco
Systems Inc. (CSCO) ’s earnings beat estimates.  Cisco rallied 9.6 percent while  Sears (SHLD)  Holdings Corp.
climbed 6.5 percent as its loss narrowed. An S&P index of
homebuilders soared 4.4 percent to the highest level since 2008.
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  dropped 6.3 percent to the lowest price since its
initial public offering as the end of a lockup period freed
271.1 million shares for trading.  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  fell 3.1
percent after its forecast trailed analyst estimates.  The S&P 500 rose 0.7 percent to 1,415.51 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The benchmark index is less than four points from a four-
year peak of 1,419.04 set on April 2. The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  added 85.33 points, or 0.7 percent, to 13,250.11. The
Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 1 percent to 3,062.39. Volume for
exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 5.9 billion shares, 9
percent below the three-month average.  “We’re in a situation where the economy is growing, jobs
are being created, and the consumer seems to be feeling better
about spending,” Jason Benowitz, who helps manage $5 billion at
Roosevelt Investment Group Inc. in New York, said in a phone
interview. “The fact permitting is improving in the housing
market suggests the future is going to be there. On the other
hand, you have to counterweight the less likely chance of
further monetary easing.”  The  S&P 500  Total Return index, which assumes dividends are
reinvested back into the gauge’s 500 stocks, climbed to a record
today even as the regular S&P 500 remained almost 10 percent
below its peak in 2007.  Narrow Range  Stocks broke out of a narrow trading range today. The S&P
500 has hovered around 1,400 for the past seven sessions, with
intraday price movement averaging 0.6 percent, the smallest
fluctuation over a comparable period since January 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Dow’s price swings
were less than 1 percent from Aug. 6 through yesterday, the
narrowest since at least 2000, the data show.  Trading volume  and volatility have dropped as vacationing
traders awaited policy clues from the Federal Reserve’s summit
at the end of the month and a European Central Bank meeting in
September. The index has rallied 11 percent from a five-month
low on June 1 amid speculation global central banks will
introduce further stimulus measures.  Equities extended gains after a person familiar with the
matter said Spain is about to get an emergency disbursement from
a 100 billion-euro ($123 billion) bailout package. German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  said the ECB’s insistence on
conditionality in return for help to lower borrowing costs in
indebted countries matches her country’s priorities to end the
crisis in the euro region.  ‘Good Story’  “Everybody is seeing an emerging good story coming out of
Europe,”  Greg Peterson , director of investment research at
Ballentine Partners LLC in Waltham, Massachusetts, which has
about $4 billion in assets, said in a phone interview.
“American corporations are in great shape. Their earnings are
solid and their cash at hand is excellent. I expect the solid
returns to hold for the rest of the year, if not build on it.”  Building permits, a proxy for future construction, rose to
an 812,000 pace, the most since August 2008, the Commerce
Department said today. A Labor Department report showed jobless
claims climbed by 2,000 to 366,000 in the week ended Aug. 11
while the Fed Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index
showed manufacturing in the Philadelphia region contracted in
August for a fourth consecutive month.  Aggregate Data  “Today’s data is by and large neutral,” Wasif Latif, vice
president of equity investments at USAA Investments in San
Antonio, which oversees about $50 billion, said in a phone
interview. “But when you aggregate the data that have been
coming in during the summer, there does seem to be some
softening going on in the economic activity, other than the
bottoming that we’re witnessing in housing. That would indicate
that the Fed continues to be ready to do something.”  Technology, commodity and industrial companies rose the
most among  10 S&P 500 industry groups , jumping at least 0.9
percent. The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index climbed 1.6 percent
to the highest level since May as investors snapped up shares
most tied to economic swings.  The S&P gauge of computer and software makers advanced 1.5
percent.  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  gained 1.9 percent to $30.78 while
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  added 1.2 percent to
$200.84.  Cisco Surges  Cisco surged 9.6 percent, the most in a year, to $19.02.
The biggest maker of computer-networking equipment reported
profit and sales that topped analysts’ estimates as job cuts
kept costs in check and price reductions attracted customers.  Sears climbed 6.5 percent to $60.29. The retailer
controlled by hedge fund manager  Edward Lampert  reported a
smaller second-quarter loss, helped by reduced inventory costs.  All 11 members of the S&P Supercomposite  Homebuilding Index (S15HOME) 
advanced.  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM)  jumped 6.4 percent to $13.60,  KB Home (KBH) 
added 5.5 percent to $10.89 and  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  increased 5.6
percent to $32.16.  Home Depot Inc. (HD) , the largest U.S. home-improvement
retailer, rose 2.4 percent to $56.31, the highest level since
2000. Smaller rival Lowe’s Cos. gained 2.3 percent to $27.45.  GameStop Corp. (GME)  climbed 5.5 percent to $17.98 for the
biggest increase since April 2011. The largest video-game
retailer boosted its dividend by 67 percent and said it will buy
back stock after reporting a drop in second-quarter earnings.  Facebook Sinks  Facebook sank 6.3 percent to $19.87, the lowest close ever.
The world’s largest social network freed up 271.1 million of its
shares today, boosting by 60 percent the number that could be
traded and adding to concerns that have weighed on the stock
since the company’s May IPO.  Early Facebook investors such as DST Global Ltd., Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., Elevation Partners and Accel Partners get a
green light today to start selling part of their holdings, Menlo
Park, California-based Facebook has said in filings.  Wal-Mart fell 3.1 percent to $72.15. The world’s largest
retailer said profit this year may be $4.83 to $4.93 a share
amid slowing sales growth in the U.S. The average estimate of
analysts was for profit of $4.93.  Agilent Technologies Inc. (A)  tumbled 8.2 percent to $37.15.
The maker of scientific-testing equipment cut its full-year
forecasts, citing slowing economic growth and delays in order
deliveries from customers. Profit for the current fiscal year
will be no more than $3.08 a share, Agilent said. Analysts, on
average, estimated $3.23.  Perrigo, Idenix  Perrigo Co. (PRGO)  slipped 6.6 percent to $108.93. The generic
over-the-counter drugmaker reported fourth-quarter sales of
$831.8 million, trailing the average analyst estimate of $854
million in a Bloomberg survey.  Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. (IDIX)  plunged 30 percent, the most in
two years, to $5.84. A trial of the company’s hepatitis C drug
was placed on hold because of heart failure concerns raised in a
competitor’s study of a similar medicine, Idenix said.  A possible stalemate around U.S. fiscal tightening and a
slowing economy will pull stocks down this year, even as
equities may gain in the longer term, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s
chief U.S. equity strategist said.  “The uncertainty that is very significant relating to the
fiscal cliff and the budget issues and the  tax policy  for next
year are unlikely to get resolved in the very near term,” New
York-based David Kostin said in a radio interview today on
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . Still, “if you are
looking where you are buying the market now, on a long term
basis, it is attractive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
