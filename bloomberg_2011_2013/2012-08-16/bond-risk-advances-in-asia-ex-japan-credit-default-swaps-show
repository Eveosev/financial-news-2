The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment rose in Asia outside of Japan,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan advanced 1 basis point to 150 basis
points as of 8:42 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge has fallen 10 basis points this
month and ranged between 147 basis points and 175.3 basis points
this quarter, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 187
basis points as of 9:22 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The benchmark has traded between 184.2 basis points and
207 basis points this month, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index was also little changed
at 156 basis points as of 10:41 a.m. in Sydney,  National
Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
