German stocks  advanced as U.K.
retail sales unexpectedly increased in July, outweighing a
report that showed foreign direct investment into  China  plunged
to the lowest level in two years.  Merck KGaA advanced 3.6 percent.  Constantin Medien AG (EV4)  added
0.9 percent after posting second-quarter profit and confirming
its 2012 revenue forecast.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA) , climbed  1.9 percent
as a gauge of raw-material producers was among the  best
performer  on the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index.  The  DAX Index (DAX)  gained 0.7 percent to 6,996.29 at the close
of trade in  Frankfurt . The benchmark measure has  rallied 17
percent  from this year’s low on June 5 as central banks around
the world took steps to bolster economic growth. The broader
HDAX Index also added 0.7 percent today.  “Many asset managers are still buying German equities
because it is difficult to find alternatives,” said  Robert Halver , head of capital markets research at Baader Bank AG in
Frankfurt. “ Germany  remains the last anchor of stability in the
euro zone and has a wonderful industrial culture. There is no
deep angst about the economy losing momentum.”  In the U.K.,  retail sales  including auto fuel rose 0.3
percent from June, the  Office for National Statistics  said. The
median forecast of 22 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was
for a 0.1 percent decline. Sales in June were revised to a 0.8
percent gain from 0.1 percent, which means second-quarter sales
fell 0.3 percent, less than initially estimated. Excluding fuel,
sales were unchanged in July from the previous month.  In China, FDI declined 8.7 percent from a year earlier to
$7.58 billion, the eighth drop in nine months and the smallest
inflow since July 2010. The Ministry of Commerce released the
data at a briefing in Beijing today.  Stimulus Optimism  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said there’s “growing room for monetary
policy operation,” state television reported yesterday,
boosting optimism China will increase stimulus measures.  In the U.S.,  house building  dropped more than economists
had predicted, a Commerce Department report showed. Builders
broke ground on 746,000 properties at an annual rate, a drop of
1.1 percent from June. That missed the 756,000 median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey.  A Labor Department report showed  jobless claims  rose to
366,000 last week from a revised 364,000 a week earlier. The
median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey had
called for an increase to 365,000.  A Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia report showed that
 manufacturing  in its region shrank more than economists had
forecast. The index climbed to minus 7.1 in August from minus
12.9 in July. The Bloomberg survey median had called for a
reading of minus 5. Figures less than zero indicate contraction.  Merck, Constantin  Merck, the maker of the Erbitux cancer drug, added 3.6
percent to 89.70 euros for the best performance on the DAX.  Constantin Medien gained 0.9 percent to 1.37 euros after
posting a profit in the second quarter and the first half. The
company also reiterated its 2012 sales forecast of as much as
480 million euros.  ThyssenKrupp, Germany’s largest steelmaker, advanced 1.9
percent to 16.07 euros. A gauge of raw-material producers was
the fourth-best performer on the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
rebounding from yesterday’s 2.1 percent drop.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  added 1.9 percent to 40.23 euros after
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  cited Chairman Bernd Scheifele as saying he
wants to cut the company’s debt by half to 7 billion euros.  Infineon Technologies AG (IFX) , Europe’s second-largest
semiconductor maker, rallied 1.2 percent to 5.98 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
