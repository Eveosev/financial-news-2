Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) , a
maker of chips for mobile phones and communication and storage
gear, declined the most in more than six years after predicting
sales and profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The stock  tumbled  14 percent to $10.54 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest drop since June 2006. Marvell said
yesterday that profit, excluding some costs, will be 24 cents a
share, plus or minus 2 cents, in the current quarter, which ends
in October. Analysts on average had  estimated  32 cents,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will be $800
million to $850 million, compared with a $913 million average
analyst projection.  Marvell’s storage business, which makes chips that control
computer hard drives, is suffering as personal computer demand
slows and device makers turn to alternative technology. Its
wireless business is struggling as customers such as  Research In
Motion Ltd. (RIM)  lose market share.  Chief Executive Officer Sehat Sutardja said on a conference
call yesterday he expects the mobile and wireless market to
decline by mid-single percentage points in the third quarter
from the second.  “Our results in the second quarter were affected primarily
by the slowdown in the macro-economic environment that impacted
our storage and mobile markets,” Sehat said in a statement.  The computer storage market will grow in the low-single
digits in the same period, he said.  Second-quarter net  income  was $93.1 million, or 16 cents a
share, compared with $192.4 million, or 31 cents, in the same
period a year earlier. Revenue fell 9.1 percent to $816.1
million. Both sales and profit  missed  analysts’ predictions.  The  stock  had gained 34 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $12.28 at
yesterday’s close in New York, leaving it down 11.3 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
