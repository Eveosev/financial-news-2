Tropical Storm Gordon became the
seventh named storm of the 2012  Atlantic hurricane season ,
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.  The system has maximum winds of 40 miles (64 kilometers)
per hour, above the 39 mph threshold required to be classified
as a tropical storm. It’s moving north-northwest at 14 mph, the
agency said in an  advisory  shortly before 5 a.m.  New York  time.  Gordon is 585 miles east of Bermuda and 1,615 miles west of
the Azores, the Miami-based NHC said in a posting on its
website.  “Interests in the Azores should monitor the progress of
Gordon,” the NHC said on its website. “There are no coastal
watches or warnings in effect.”  Six named storms have formed this year including Hurricane
Ernesto, which struck  Mexico  last week, killing at least two
people and causing widespread flooding. The Atlantic season runs
from June 1 to Nov. 30 and U.S. forecasters expect 12 to 17
storms to form in the basin.  The remnants of Ernesto later reformed into Hector in the
Pacific, where it degenerated into a tropical depression
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
