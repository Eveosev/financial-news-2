Copper rose the most in more than a
week as U.S. building permits jumped to a four-year high, adding
to signs of improvement in the housing market.  Building permits, a proxy for future construction,
increased to an 812,000 annual pace in July, the most since
August 2008, Commerce Department figures showed today.
Construction generates about 40 percent of demand for the metal,
used in pipes and wiring, according to the Copper Development
Association. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw
materials climbed as much as 0.9 percent.  “Any time you see a positive report on housing, that’s
bullish for copper,”  Adam Klopfenstein , the senior market
strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview. “Signs of stability and traction in the
housing market will lend support to copper, and we’re seeing
broader strength in commodities and equities.”  Copper futures for December delivery rose 1 percent to
settle at $3.3935 a pound at 1:12 p.m. on the Comex in  New York ,
the biggest gain since Aug. 7. The metal has fallen 2.9 percent
this quarter on concerns that the debt crisis in Europe and
slowing growth in  China  would erode demand.  The permits figures add to signs of recovery in the U.S.
real-estate market. A private report yesterday showed builder
confidence climbed in August to the highest level in more than
five years.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months advanced 0.9 percent to $7,449 a metric ton ($3.38 a
pound).  Aluminum, lead, tin and nickel also rose in London. Zinc
fell.  To contact the reporters on this story:
