Globe Trade Centre SA (GTC) , Poland’s
second-largest property developer by market value, dropped to
the lowest in two months after posting a quarterly loss.  The  shares  fell as much as 5.6 percent to 5.77 zloty, the
lowest since June 12. They traded at 6.05 zloty as of 1:44 p.m.
in Warsaw, valuing GTC, the  worst-performing  stock in the WIG20
Index this year, at 1.45 billion zloty ($437 million).  The second-quarter net loss was 60.9 million zloty,
compared with a 145.7-million zloty loss a year earlier, as GTC
devalued assets in Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, it said in a
statement today. Retail markets in southeastern  Europe  will
“remain weak” because of “poor economic performance,” GTC
 added .  “GTC disappointed on the bottom line,” Bartlomiej
Kubicki, a Vienna-based analyst at Raiffeisen Centrobank AG,
said by e-mail today. “I don’t expect a significant improvement
in their operational performance in the near future as the
amelioration of the economies in the SEE region will take some
time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
