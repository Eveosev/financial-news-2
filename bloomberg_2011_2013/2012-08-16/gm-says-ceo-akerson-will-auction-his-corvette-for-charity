General Motors Co. (GM)  Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson plans to auction off his 1958 Chevrolet
Corvette to raise money for charity.  Akerson, who became CEO almost two years ago, plans to
donate proceeds of the auction to Habitat for Humanity  Detroit 
and its efforts to rebuild an east side neighborhood called
Morningside Commons, GM said today in a statement. Auction
details will be announced later, the Detroit-based company said.  “I love this Corvette, and if putting it on the block can
help rebuild the heart and soul of a neighborhood, I am all for
it,” Akerson said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
