Residual-fuel supplies in Singapore,
 Asia ’s biggest center for oil trading, refining and storage,
fell to the lowest in three weeks, according to a unit of the
Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Stockpiles of  fuel oil  and low-sulfur waxy residue,
excluding bitumen, declined by 3.46 million barrels, or 16
percent, to 17.8 million barrels in the seven days ended
yesterday, International Enterprise Singapore said in an e-
mailed statement today. That’s the lowest since the week ended
July 25.  Middle-distillate stockpiles, including gasoil and kerosene,
dropped by 357,000 barrels, or 3.7 percent, to 9.3 million,
according to the data.  Light-distillate inventories of naphtha, gasoline and
reformate gained by 252,000 barrels, or 2.7 percent, to 9.52
million.  The trade ministry surveys refiners, traders and storage
terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude offshore
storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
