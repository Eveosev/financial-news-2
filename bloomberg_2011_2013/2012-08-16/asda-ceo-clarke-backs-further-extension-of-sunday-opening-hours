Asda, the U.K. supermarket chain
owned by  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , said the retailer would support
an extension of Sunday opening hours after the 2012 Olympics
ends, according to Chief Executive Officer  Andy Clarke .  “Giving greater customer accessibility to more shopping
hours across the trading week has got to be a benefit for the
customer, so I would support it,” Clarke said at a press
conference in London today.  Asda, Tesco Plc and  J Sainsbury (SBRY)  Plc have all taken
advantage of the U.K. government’s decision to extend Sunday
trading hours beyond the traditional six over the eight weekends
straddling the Olympic and Paralympic games. Clarke said it was
too early to say if sales have been boosted as a result.  J Sainsbury, the U.K.’s third-largest supermarket chain,
doesn’t think customers want the extra hours extended
permanently, a spokeswoman for the grocer said Aug. 13. Tesco,
the nation’s biggest grocer, said the same day that it is
monitoring the response from customers.  Asda today reported same-store sales, excluding petrol and
value-added tax, slowed to 0.7 percent in the second quarter
ended June 30. That compares with a gain of 2.2 percent in the
prior quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
