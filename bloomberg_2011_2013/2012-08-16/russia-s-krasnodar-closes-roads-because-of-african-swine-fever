Russia ’s southern Krasnodar closed
roads to block movement of some food due to African Swine Fever.  The ban applies to pork goods and produce such as root
vegetables, Krasnodar’s regional administration said in a
statement on its website today. It may be extended to
transportation of other products if the virus continues to
spread, Eduard Kutygin, deputy governor and Krasnodar’s
agriculture minister, said in the statement.  Krasnodar is Russia’s main grain growing region, and
accounted for 12 percent of last year’s national crop with
11.4 million metric tons, according to the state statistics
data. It is also Russia’s main grain exporting route through
Black Sea ports.  “Essentially, this won’t affect grain exports at all,”
Alexander Korbut, vice president of Russia’s Grain Union, said
by phone from Moscow today.  More than 100,000 pigs died and have been slaughtered in
the past two weeks in southern Krasnodar because of the virus,
according to the regional government. The so-called quarantine
regime will run for two months, Kutygin said.  The virus has no vaccine and is deadly for pigs and
harmless for humans, according to the  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization. Since 2007, it has affected 307
Russian areas, caused 540,000 hogs to be slaughtered and
resulted in farmers getting 1.7 billion rubles ($53 million) in
compensation, according to the food safety agency known as
Rosselkhoznadzor. Krasnodar is the most affected in Russia, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
