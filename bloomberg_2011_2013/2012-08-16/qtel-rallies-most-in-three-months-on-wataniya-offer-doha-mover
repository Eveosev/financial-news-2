Qatar Telecom  QSC rallied the most
in more than three months after it offered $2.2 billion for the
remainder of  Kuwait ’s  National Mobile Telecommunications Co. (NMTC)  as
the company steps up acquisitions amid competition at home.  Qatar Telecom, majority owned by the gas-rich country’s
government, rallied 3.3 percent, the most since May 10, to 108.9
riyals at the close in Doha. The shares pushed Qatar’s QE Index
up 0.8 percent to 8,486.96, the highest since May 28. Shares of
 Vodafone Qatar (VFQS) , which competes with Qatar Telecom, slipped 0.8
percent.  Qatar Telecom will pay 2.6 dinars ($9.2) each for the 239.4
million shares it doesn’t own after approval from the Kuwait
Capital Markets Authority. That’s an 18 percent premium to 2.2
dinars when the stock last traded on June 25. Shares of National
Mobile, also known as  Wataniya Telecom , have been suspended
since the offer was announced.  “It’s reasonably priced,” said Umar Faruqui, a financial
analyst at Kuwait-based Global Investment House KSCC. “Our fair
value is 2.59 dinars. One of their strategies is to increase
their stake in companies which are performing well, so Wataniya
is one of them.”  Eight analysts recommend investors buy the shares of Qatar
Telecom, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The nation’s
biggest phone company said last month second-quarter profit
dropped 11 percent because of “adverse foreign exchange
movement in Indonesia and Algeria.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
