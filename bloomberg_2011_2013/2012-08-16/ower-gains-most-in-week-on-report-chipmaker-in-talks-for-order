Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (TSEM)  advanced
the most in more than a week after Globes reported the maker of
customized chips is in talks with a foreign client for a multi-
million dollar order.  The  shares  of the Migdal Haemek, Israel-based company
climbed 7.7 percent, the biggest intraday gain since Aug. 8, to
31.89 shekels at 2:55 p.m. in Tel Aviv.  A Tower official who couldn’t be identified because of
company policy declined to comment when contacted by Bloomberg.
Globes didn’t say where it got the information.  Tower shares have fallen 23 percent since the company
reported on Aug. 9 a loss in the second quarter and said this
quarter’s sales will fall short of analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
