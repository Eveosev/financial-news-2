Gasoline retreated from a 15-week
high as an increase in U.S. jobless claims and a drop in housing
starts increased concern that economic growth may slow, reducing
fuel demand.  Futures sank as the number of Americans  filing  for
 unemployment benefits  climbed by 2,000 to 366,000 in the week
ended Aug. 11, the Labor Department said. Construction of new
homes sank 1.1 percent in July, Commerce Department data show.
Gasoline demand typically declines after the Labor Day holiday,
which falls this year on Sept. 3. Emissions specifications in
fuel will loosen after the summer, expanding available supply.  “The economy continues growing in fits and starts,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
“This is the last of the summer-grade gasoline and, as we move
past September, it will be less expensive to produce winter
grade.”  September-delivery gasoline fell 2.77 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.0563 a gallon at 10:03 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange. October gasoline sank 1.43 cents to
$2.8739.  Futures gained 2.8 percent yesterday as the department
reported  gasoline supplies  dropped 2.37 million barrels to 203.7
million, the lowest level since the week ended June 15 and the
lowest for this time of the year since 2008. Wholesale  demand 
jumped to a 13-month high.  “The  market was driven higher yesterday by a drawdown in
gasoline supplies and some of those concerns may be easing off a
little bit,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price
Futures Group in  Chicago .  Heating oil for September delivery slipped 0.59 cent to
$3.0793 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.1
cent to $3.71 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. That’s the
highest level since May 17. Prices have climbed 38.4 cents since
July 1, according to data from the nation’s largest motoring
organization.  To contact the reporters on this story:
