Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of
Forties crude at a higher premium than the previous trade. Vitol
Group failed to sell Russian Urals and Nigerian Escravos grades
for a second day.  Angola,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will increase
its crude exports in October to 54 cargoes, three more than next
month, according to a preliminary loading program obtained by
Bloomberg.  North Sea  Phillips 66 sold the Forties cargo at a 40 cents a barrel
premium to Dated Brent for loading on Sept. 2 to Sept. 4,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts trading window. That compares with a trade
done on Aug. 14 at 20 cents above the benchmark.  Mercuria Energy Trading SA and Total SA both bid for one
lot of the blend for loading on Sept. 5 to Sept. 7 for a second
day. Mercuria was seeking to buy at a premium of 40 cents to
Dated Brent, down from 50 cents yesterday.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc failed to sell a shipment of the
grade for a fourth day. The company offered a cargo for loading
on Aug. 30 to Sept. 1 at 20 cents less than Dated Brent. That
compares with a 10 cents premium in the previous session.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was at 29 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent, down from a premium of 31 cents yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for September settlement traded at $115.98 a barrel
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London at the close of the
window, up from $115.12 yesterday. The contract expires later
today. The more actively traded October contract was at $114.30,
narrowing the discount to September to $1.68 from $1.85 in the
previous session.  Mediterranean/Urals  Vitol failed to find a buyer for 100,000 metric tons of
Urals at parity to Dated Brent for loading on Aug. 28 to Sept.
1, the survey of Platts showed. The company offered at 15 cents
more than Dated Brent yesterday.  No bids or offers were made for the blend in the
Mediterranean. The grade fell 4 cents to 63 cents a barrel more
than Dated Brent in the region, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Russia will ship 12 Urals cargoes of 100,000 tons each from
the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk from Aug. 31 to Sept. 6, a
partial loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Shipments from the Baltic port of Ust-Luga will be four
consignments of 100,000 tons each over the same period,
according to the schedule.  Russia will also export two lots of 140,000 tons and four
80,000 ton shipments of crude from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea 
from Sept. 1 to Sept. 6. One of the 80,000 ton shipments will be
Siberian Light grade and the other lots will be Urals.  TNK-BP issued a tender to sell 100,000 tons of Urals for
Sept. 1 to Sept. 2 loading from Ust-Luga, said two traders who
participate in the market. The tender closes tomorrow.  Emirates National Oil Co. Ltd. sold about 1 million barrels
of Saharan Blend crude to Hindustan Petroleum Corp., said two
traders who asked not to be identified because the information
is confidential.  West Africa  Vitol failed to sell a cargo of either 650,000 or 950,000
barrels of  Nigeria ’s Escravos crude for loading on Aug. 20 to
Aug. 24 at a $2.10 more than Dated Brent, the survey showed. The
shipment was offered at a $2.15 premium yesterday.  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe was $1.48 a barrel more than
Dated Brent, 2 cents less than the previous session, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Angola  plans to ship 51.86 million barrels, or 1.67 million
barrels a day, the plan showed. This compares with 1.63 million
in September.  Angola will export one consignment of Gimboa and two lots
of Mondo grades in October, compared with none for September,
the schedule showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
