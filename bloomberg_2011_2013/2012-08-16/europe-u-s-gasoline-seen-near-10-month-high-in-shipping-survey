The flow of European gasoline to the
U.S. is poised to rise to an almost 10-month high, according to
a survey of people directly involved in arranging cargoes.  Traders booked or plan to book 34 Medium-Range tankers,
each hauling about 37,000 metric tons of the fuel, for loading
in the next two weeks, according to the Bloomberg News survey of
five shipbrokers and a trader yesterday and today. That would be
the most since Oct. 27 and compares with 21 a week ago.  Of the 34 charters, 18 were already organized and 16 are
likely to happen, according to the survey. There are 30 MR
tankers that can load the gasoline, compared with 36 last week.  The survey is based on the industry’s so-called TC2 trade,
a designation for cargoes to  New York  from Rotterdam that’s
published by the  Baltic Exchange , the London-based shipping
bourse. Freight costs on the route climbed for an eighth
consecutive session yesterday, advancing 5 percent to 124.38
Worldscale points, according to the exchange.  The rate means costs are 24.38 percent higher than a
nominal dollars-per-ton flat rate assigned to the route from
January by the Worldscale Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
