Malaysia’s ringgit rose the most in
more than a week after economic growth unexpectedly accelerated
in the second quarter.  Gross domestic product  increased 5.4 percent from a year
earlier, beating all 23 estimates in a Bloomberg survey of
economists, according to figures released by the central bank.
The median forecast was for growth to slow to 4.6 percent from
4.9 percent in the first quarter. Expansion for the full year
may be at the upper end of the projected 4 percent-to-5 percent
range even as risks from  Europe  and the U.S. remain,  Bank Negara
Malaysia  said.  “Demand for the ringgit is on the uptake because of the
strong second-quarter GDP,” said Yeo Chin Tiong, head of
financial markets at Alliance Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “In
the near term, the Malaysian currency should trade in a tight
range in the absence of positive news.”  The ringgit gained 0.2 percent to 3.1273 per dollar as of
9:08 a.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , after weakening 0.5 percent
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 6.65 percent.  The government also reported yesterday a 1.4 percent
increase in consumer prices for July, less than the median
forecast for a 1.6 percent gain in a Bloomberg survey. That was
the smallest advance since March 2010.  Malaysia’s five-year bonds declined yesterday. The yield on
the 3.314 percent notes due October 2017 rose three basis points
to 3.35 percent, the highest level since the debt was sold in
April, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
