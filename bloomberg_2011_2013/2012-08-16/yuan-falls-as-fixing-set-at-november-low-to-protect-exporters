China’s  yuan  dropped to a one-week
low as the central bank weakened its daily fixing to the lowest
level since November to help exporters.  The People’s Bank of China reduced the  reference rate  by
0.02 percent to 6.3495 per dollar, the least since Nov. 29,
after the  Dollar Index  climbed 0.2 percent yesterday. Premier
 Wen Jiabao  said there’s “growing room for monetary-policy
operations,” during a two-day visit to the eastern province of
Zhejiang, according to a report on state television.  “China will keep the yuan weaker to alleviate pressure on
exporters,” said  Daniel Chan , executive vice president at Glory
Sky Global Markets Ltd. in Hong Kong. “There’s no surprise in
what Wen said. More aggressive easing is just a matter of timing
and investors are waiting for genuine actions.”  The yuan declined 0.05 percent to close at 6.3658 per
dollar in Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency traded at a 0.26 percent discount to
the daily fixing, well within the 1 percent limit. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, decreased six basis points, or 0.06 percentage
point, to 1.25 percent.  China has “the conditions and capabilities, and will be
sure to fulfill this year’s economic and social development
target,” Wen said while in Zhejiang, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported. The nation is targeting growth of 7.5 percent
in 2012, he said in March.  Foreign direct investment in the world’s second-largest
economy dropped 8.7 percent in July from a year earlier, the
Ministry of Commerce said today. That compares with the 2.5
percent decline estimated by economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan was little changed
at 6.3713 per dollar. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell
0.09 percent to 6.4460, at 1.2 percent discount to the onshore
rate, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
