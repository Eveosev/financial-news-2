India’s bonds fell for a fifth day,
driving yields to a two-month high, after central bank Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao said high  inflation  limits the scope for
measures to stimulate economic growth.  Wholesale prices rose 6.87 percent in July from a year
earlier, data published by the commerce ministry on Aug. 14
showed, the fastest pace among the largest  emerging markets . The
 Reserve Bank  of India held its  repurchase rate  at 8 percent on
July 31, while raising its inflation estimate for the fiscal
year through March 2013 to 7 percent from 6.5 percent. It will
next review borrowing costs on Oct. 30.  “Inflation is still a concern,” said N.S. Venkatesh,
Mumbai-based head of treasury at state-run  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  “The
central bank may put off any monetary easing until at least
October.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose four
basis points, or 0.04 percent, to 8.26 percent in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system, the highest
level since June 9.  Inflation was 5.2 percent in Brazil, 1.8 percent in China
and 5.6 percent in Russia last month, official figures show.  “Inflation is high,  oil prices , though they have come off
$100 a barrel, are at elevated levels, the external sector is
under stress,” Subbarao said in a speech on Aug. 13. “There is
just no space for fiscal or monetary response.”  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, climbed four
basis points to 7.83 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
