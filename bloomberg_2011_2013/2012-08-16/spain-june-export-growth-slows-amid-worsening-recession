Spanish  export s slowed in June,
undermining the only growth driver left in the euro region’s
fourth-biggest economy as the strictest austerity push in
decades deepened the second  recession  since 2009.  Spanish exports rose 5.1 percent to 18.9 billion euros
($23.2 billion) compared with a 10.8 percent increase a year
earlier and a 6.2 percent increase in May, the  Economy Ministry 
said in a statement from Madrid today. Imports slipped 1.4
percent compared with June 2011 and the country’s trade deficit
narrowed to 2.7 billion euros.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy ’s People’s Party government
overhauled Spanish labor rules on Feb. 10, making it easier for
companies to cut payroll during a downturn. The move seeks to
improve competitiveness while efforts to cut the euro region’s
third-largest  budget gap  weigh on demand.  The government forecasts domestic demand will shrink 4
percent in 2012, more than twice last year’s rate. Public
spending is seen contracting 4.8 percent after 2.2 percent last
year, while a 24.6 percent unemployment rate will push household
spending down 1.5 percent, after a 0.1 percent drop in 2011.  Spain ’s economy will contract 1.5 percent as export growth
slows to 1.6 percent this year from 9 percent in 2011, the
government said on Aug 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
