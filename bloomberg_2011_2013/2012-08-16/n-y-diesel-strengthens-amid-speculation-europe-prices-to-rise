New York  diesel strengthened amid
speculation that prices in  Europe  will rise to a record,
increasing the incentive to export the fuel.  Retail diesel prices should reach a record high this week
or early next week,  Olivier Jakob , managing director of
Petromatrix GmbH, a Switzerland-based researcher, said in a note
today.  The premium for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in New York Harbor
rose 0.25 cent to 13.13 cents versus heating oil futures traded
on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 3:15 p.m., according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery gained 4.02 cents to
$3.2542 a gallon.  Diesel barges  in Europeâ€™s wholesale market surged to a
premium of $39 a metric ton to September gasoil on the ICE
Futures Europe exchange on Aug. 14, the most since July 18,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Traders booked or plan to book 34 tankers, each hauling
about 37,000 metric tons of the fuel, for loading in the next
two weeks, according to a Bloomberg News survey of five
shipbrokers and a trader yesterday and today. That would be the
most since Oct. 27 and up from 21 a week ago.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor versus futures traded on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  narrowed 0.37 cent to 2.13
cents a gallon. Prompt delivery gained 0.3 cent to $3.062.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  widened 3.5 cent to 15.25 cents a gallon, a three-
week low.  Exxon Mobil Corp. expects production at its Beaumont,
Texas, refinery to be affected after a power failure yesterday
caused multiple unit upsets. Power has been restored and the
plant is resuming normal operations, Kathleen Jackson, a
Beaumont-based spokeswoman for Exxon, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
