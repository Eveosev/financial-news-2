Molycorp Inc. (MCP) , the U.S. owner of the
largest rare-earth deposit outside of China, may raise as much
as $517.5 million selling shares and convertible bonds to help
fund construction at its mine in  California .  Molycorp will offer as much as $172.5 million of shares and
as much as $345 million of convertible senior notes due in 2017,
the  Greenwood Village , Colorado-based company said in a
statement today. It intends to use the proceeds to fund
operating expenses, working capital and  capital expenditures .  The company’s largest shareholders, Resource Capital Fund
and Chile’s  Molibdenos y Metales SA (MOLYMET) , have agreed to buy $35
million and $25 million of stock respectively if Molycorp
requests it, Molycorp said in a filing. Molycorp won’t request
the purchase if the offering of convertible notes is successful,
according to a separate filing.  Molycorp is restarting output at the Mountain Pass mine as
China, which accounts for more than 90 percent of global rare-
earth supply, cuts output and restricts exports. The company
posted a surprise second-quarter loss on Aug. 2 after rare-earth
prices fell and said it would raise funds to pay for “a
substantial portion” of its remaining 2012 capital spending.
Molycorp bought Canadian metals producer Neo Material
Technologies Inc. for C$1.3 billion ($1.3 billion) in June.  Molycorp  fell  7.5 percent to $11.16 in  New York , the lowest
since its July 2010 initial public offering. The shares have
dropped 53 percent this year.  Mountain Pass  Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG are managing the
bond sale and Morgan Stanley is handling the share sale.  Molycorp sold $230 million of 3.25 percent convertible debt
in 2011 with a conversion price of $71.40.  Mountain Pass is scheduled to produce at a rate of as much
as 19,500 metric tons of rare-earth oxides a year by the fourth
quarter. Molycorp plans to double the mine’s capacity to 40,000
tons by the end of 2013.  Rare earths are 17 chemically similar elements used in
batteries, magnets and computer hard drives. Prices soared in
2011 after  China  announced quotas on exports before declining as
some buyers use substitute materials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
