Aluminum Corporation of China Ltd.,
the nation’s biggest producer of the lightweight metal, swung to
a first-half loss on weaker prices and higher fuel costs.  Net loss attributable to its parent company was 3.25
billion  yuan  ($510 million), or 0.241 yuan per share, in the
first six months, compared with a profit of 412.6 million yuan a
year earlier, according to a statement to the Hong Kong stock
exchange today. Sales rose 9 percent to 71.7 billion yuan.  Chalco posted a loss in the first quarter after aluminum
prices in  London  fell 12 percent in the period from a year
earlier. The company said in April that it record a first-half
loss as the price of the metal remains “hovering around low
levels” and raw material and fuel costs remain high.  The Beijing-based company announced this week that it
agreed to buy 35.3 percent of Ningxia Electric Power Group Co.
for 2.02 billion yuan to increase energy self-sufficiency.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
