U.S. embassy officials in  Venezuela 
interviewed a detained U.S. citizen a week after the South
American country arrested a man President  Hugo Chavez  said may
be a “mercenary.”  U.S. consular officials “met with a U.S. citizen being
held by Venezuelan authorities,” the Embassy said today in an
e-mailed statement, without revealing the person’s identity or
more information about the meeting. U.S. diplomats will
coordinate with Venezuela and “seek further access when
appropriate.”  Chavez said Aug. 9 that police captured a U.S. citizen
attempting to enter Venezuela illegally from  Colombia . The man
of Hispanic origin had passport stamps showing he’d visited
Iraq, Afghanistan and  Libya . The man tore up a notebook
containing coordinates while being arrested, Chavez said.  The U.S. embassy did not specify whether the individual
officials met with was the same man referred to by Chavez.  During questioning, the man said he was a former marine,
Chavez said Aug. 10. Venezuelan officials contacted the State
Department directly about the case, U.S. State Department
spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland  said Aug. 13.  Chavez, who faces elections on Oct. 7 and wants to extend
his 13 years in power with another six-year term, often points
to an attempted coup in 2002 as evidence that the U.S. and his
domestic opponents are planning to overthrow him. The self-
declared socialist has said that the opposition may react
violently to losing the elections and that the arrest “obliges
us to activate all the alarms.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
