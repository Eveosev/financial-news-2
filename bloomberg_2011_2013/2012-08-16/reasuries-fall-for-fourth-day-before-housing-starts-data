Treasuries fell for a fourth day
before a report economists forecast will show new-home
construction in the U.S. was close to the most since 2008.  Ten-year yields, the benchmark for home mortgages and
corporate bonds, climbed to the highest level in 13 weeks.
Reports on jobs, consumption and factory production this month
all pointed to improvement in the  U.S. economy , curbing demand
for the relative safety of Treasuries as stocks gained.  “Yields will go up,” said Kei Katayama, who buys  U.S.
government debt  in  Tokyo  for Daiwa SB Investments Ltd., which
manages the equivalent of $62.8 billion and is a unit of Japan’s
second-largest brokerage. “Housing is very strong. It’s steady
but slow growth” for the economy, he said.  The 10-year  rate  increased four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 1.85 percent as of 6:41 a.m. in  London ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. It was as high as 1.86
percent, the most since May 11. The price of the 1.625 percent
security due in August 2022 slid 11/32, or $3.44 per $1,000 face
amount, to 97 29/32.  Daiwa SB prefers shorter maturities, those that will fall
least if yields rise, Katayama said.  U.S. builders broke ground on homes at an annual rate of
756,000 houses in July, according to the  median  estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. June’s pace of 760,000
was the highest since October 2008.  Other reports today will probably show manufacturing in the
Philadelphia area shrank in August and initial claims for
 unemployment benefits  were little changed last week, according
to separate surveys.  Housing Report  The U.S. added 163,000 jobs last month, a government report
showed on Aug. 3, more than the 100,000 projected by analysts.
Retail sales rose 0.8 percent, the biggest increase since
February, Commerce Department figures showed Aug. 14. Industrial
production increased 0.6 percent in July from June, the  Federal
Reserve  reported yesterday.  Treasuries have handed investors a 1.4 percent loss this
month as of yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch data. An index of sovereign bonds around the world dropped
0.6 percent, the data show.  The  MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  of stocks returned 2.3
percent including reinvested dividends, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Improvement in the economy is damping speculation the Fed
will expand stimulus as soon as its Sept. 12-13 meeting.  The U.S. central bank bought $2.3 trillion of mortgage and
Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing to cap borrowing costs. It’s now in the
process of swapping shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings with
those due in six to 30 years to put downward pressure on long-
term borrowing costs.  Fed Operation  The Fed is scheduled to buy as much as $2 billion of
Treasuries due from February 2036 to August 2042 today as part
of the program, according to the Fed Bank of  New York   website .  The 10-year term premium, a model created by economists at
the Fed that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth
and inflation, rose to minus 0.70 percent, the least negative
reading since May 3.  It was as low as negative 1.02 percent on July 24, the most
expensive level on record. A negative reading indicates
investors are willing to accept yields below what’s considered
fair value.  TIPS Auction  The U.S. is scheduled to announce today how much it plans
to raise in sale of five-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities Aug. 23.  The auction will probably be for $14 billion, according to
Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory company in  Jersey City ,
 New Jersey . The last sale of the securities was for $16 billion
on April 19.  An index of TIPS has declined 2.1 percent loss this month,
based on the Bank of America figures. The U.S. consumer-price
index rose 1.4 percent in July from the year before, the
smallest increase since November 2010, the Labor Department data
yesterday showed.  The  difference  between yields on 10-year notes and same-
maturity TIPS, a gauge of trader expectations for consumer
prices over the life of the debt, was 2.27 percentage points.
The average over the past decade is 2.15 percentage points.  Investors received 1 percent of additional  yield  by buying
10-year notes in the U.S. instead of  Japan . The difference was
the most since May.  Biggest Creditor  Japan, which has purchased almost five times the amount of
Treasuries as China in 2012, is on course to  overtake  the
world’s most populous country by year-end as the largest
creditor to the U.S.  Investors in Japan bought $10.4 billion of Treasuries in
June, bringing purchases for 2012 to $61.3 billion and total
holdings of the debt to $1.1193 trillion, Treasury data
yesterday showed.  China added $300 million to its portfolio of U.S.
government securities for the month, raising its purchases this
year to $12.4 billion and its stake in Treasuries to $1.1643
trillion.  Should both countries continue buying at their respective
paces through 2012, Japan will end the year with more
Treasuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
