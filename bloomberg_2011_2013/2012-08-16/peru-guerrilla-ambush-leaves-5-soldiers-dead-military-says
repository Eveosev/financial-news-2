Peruvian guerrillas ambushed an army
patrol in a jungle area of central Peru yesterday, leaving five
soldiers dead.  A night patrol was involved in an “intense” firefight
with guerrillas near a counter-terrorist base in Satipo, Junin
region that also left five soldiers wounded, the Joint Command
of the Armed Forces said in a statement on its  website .  The clash followed the Aug. 13 seizure of more than a ton
of cocaine and 800 kilograms of chemicals used to produce the
drug, which traffickers transport through Satipo with the aid of
armed groups, La Republica reported.  Attacks on army patrols have escalated as the government
steps up efforts to stem rising cocaine production and capture
holdout members of the Shining Path, a Maoist insurgency
defeated in the 1990s, which the authorities say are involved in
drug trafficking,  money laundering  and other illicit activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
