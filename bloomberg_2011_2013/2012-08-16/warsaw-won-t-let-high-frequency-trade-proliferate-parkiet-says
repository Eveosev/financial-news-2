Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW)  SA won’t allow
a “proliferation” of high-frequency trading on its main market
when it introduces a new trading system in November, Chief
Executive Officer Ludwik Sobolewski was quoted as saying by
Parkiet in an  interview .  The exchange plans to launch NYSE Euronext’s Universal
Trading Platform on Nov. 2 and expects to attract new investors,
among them exchange-traded products, Sobolewski said, according
to the newspaper. Changes in the schedule “are possible” due
to technology risks, Parkiet quoted Sobolewski as saying.  High-frequency trading now plays a “negligible” role on
the Warsaw bourse, Sobolewski said, according to Parkiet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
