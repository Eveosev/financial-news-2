Marcopolo SA (POMO4) , a Brazilian truck and
bus bodies manufacturer, snapped a two-day decline after it was
added to a benchmark index of emerging-market stocks.  Shares gained 3.4 percent to 11.37 reais at 1:57 p.m. in
Sao Paulo after earlier rising as much as 4.8 percent. The
Bovespa index advanced 1.3 percent.  Marcopolo’s voting stock will be included on the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index,  MSCI Inc. (MSCI)  said in a statement late
yesterday. The addition, part of a rebalancing following a
quarterly review, takes effect at the close of trading Aug. 31.  “The MSCI index is a benchmark for managers, so funds that
replicate it in their portfolios now have to buy these shares,”
Henrique Kleine, the chief analyst at brokerage Magliano SA,
said in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo . “Besides that,
perspectives for Marcopolo are very good as it should benefit
from the new investment plan on infrastructure the Brazilian
government announced.”  Transportation Minister Paulo Sergio Passos said in
Brasilia yesterday that the government will sell licenses to
build and operate roads and railways worth as much as 133
billion reais ($66 billion) to bolster the recovery. In June,
the government said it added 6.6 billion reais to money set
aside to buy buses, tractors, trucks and other equipment as part
of a plan to fuel growth.  Marcopolo rose 55 percent this year through yesterday while
the Bovespa gained 2.5 percent during the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
