German banks wrote to  Standard &
Poor’s  complaining about the rating company’s fee increases,
calling them no longer acceptable and non-transparent, Financial
Times Deutschland reported today, without saying where it got
the information.  The letter is also meant to be a signal to Moody’s
Investors Service and Fitch, which follow a similar pricing
policy, FTD said. Moody’s, Fitch and S&P control 95 percent of
the German market. Banks that will face higher fees might be
entitled to stretch those over several years, FTD wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
