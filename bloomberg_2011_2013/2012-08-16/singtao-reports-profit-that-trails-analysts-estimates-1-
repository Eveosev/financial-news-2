Tsingtao Brewery Co. (168)  posted first-
half profit that missed analysts’ estimates as slowing economic
growth damped demand for beer produced by  China ’s second-largest
brewer. The stock dropped.  Net income rose to 1 billion  yuan  ($157 million) in the six
months ended June 30 from 990 million yuan a year earlier,
according to a statement to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange late
yesterday. That compares with the 1.13 billion yuan average of
four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Tsingtao is increasing production as competitors including
 SABMiller Plc (SAB)  and  China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291)  expand in the
world’s most-populous country. The brewer in March said
challenges this year will include a weakening global economy and
slower growth in domestic consumption.  “The disappointing first half 2012 results evidence our
view that Tsingtao is entering a slower earnings growth phase,”
Morgan Stanley analysts Lillian Lou, Angela Moh and Mark Yuan
wrote in a note distributed today. They rate the stock
“underweight.”  Tsingtao shares fell 4.4 percent to HK$43.20 at the 4 p.m.
close in Hong Kong. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  dropped 0.45
percent.  Sales rose 11 percent to 13.4 billion yuan from 12 billion
yuan a year earlier, according to the company’s statement.
Tsingtao also said it is confident of meeting its annual
production target of 10 billion liters beer.  Market Share  China Resources Enterprise, which makes Snow beer through
its joint venture with SABMiller, had a 22 percent share of the
China beer market in 2011, according to data from Euromonitor
International. Tsingtao was second with a 14 percent share.  Chairman Jin Zhiguo resigned, Tsingtao reported in June,
less than two weeks after an investor sold a block of shares 7
percent below market price. The beermaker said at the time Jin
resigned for health reasons and that the company had no contact
with the investor before the share sale.  Tsingtao plunged 7.8 percent, the most in two years, on
June 19 as billionaire investor Chen Fashu offered 32 million
shares at HK$47 apiece, 7 percent less than the previous closing
price of HK$50.55.  To contact the reporter on this story:
