Sudan should halt the deportation of
asylum seekers from Eritrea because they face detention and
torture by the Eritrean authorities,  Amnesty International  said.  The North African country last month forcibly returned six
Eritreans to their home country, where the government considers
asylum seeking to be an act of treason, the London-based rights
group said in a statement e-mailed yesterday.  “Eritreans forcibly returned to Eritrea face a real risk of
being subjected to violations, including incommunicado
detention, torture and other forms of serious ill-treatment,”
Amnesty said. “Detention conditions in Eritrea are appalling,
and in themselves amount to cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment.”  Amnesty said the six Eritreans deported July 24 were among
a group of 51 Eritreans and Ethiopians convicted earlier in July
of entering Sudan illegally and sentenced to two months
imprisonment and deportation. The rights group said all were
denied access to lawyers and translators, while only one of the
individuals spoke Arabic and could understand court proceedings.
In addition to the six Eritreans,  Sudan  also deported four
Ethiopian nationals to Eritrea. The remaining 41 are still
imprisoned.  The deportations violate international law, which
stipulates that individuals shouldn’t be returned to countries
where they are at risk of human rights violations, according to
Amnesty. Sudanese Foreign Ministry spokesman al-Obeid Murawih
didn’t answer phone calls to his mobile phone today seeking
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
