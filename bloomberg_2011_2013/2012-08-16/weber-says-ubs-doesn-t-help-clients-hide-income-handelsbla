UBS AG (UBSN)  Chairman  Axel Weber  said the
Swiss bank doesn’t help any clients hide their income from
German authorities and doesn’t aid tax evasion, Handelsblatt
newspaper reported today, citing an interview with Weber.  The lender is forcing all employees to comply with
regulation, Weber said. He hopes a German-Swiss tax deal will be
ratified soon, adding that such a measure is “the right way.”  Weber also said the bank isn’t in settlement negotiations
on probes into the possible manipulation of interbank offered
rates, the newspaper reported. The bank drew “disciplinary and
organizational consequences” from an internal probe into Libor,
Weber told the newspaper without giving details.  To contact the reporters on this story:
