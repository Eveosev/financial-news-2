E-Star Alternativ Nyrt. (ESTAR) , a Hungarian
energy company, fell to the lowest on record after saying that
rising non-payment by local governments hit its liquidity.  The shares dropped 5.2 percent to 405 forint by the close
in Budapest, the lowest since at least October 2007. The slump
brought its losses in the past seven trading days to 28 percent
and its plunge in 2012 to 91 percent.  Outstanding receivables from the company’s “four major
problematic” municipal clients increased, which has a
“significant harmful” effect on liquidity, E-Star said in a
 statement  to the Budapest Stock Exchange after the end of trade
yesterday.  E-Star’s dwindling cash made it “questionable” the
company will be able to meet its bond payments this year, Erste
Group Bank AG wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
