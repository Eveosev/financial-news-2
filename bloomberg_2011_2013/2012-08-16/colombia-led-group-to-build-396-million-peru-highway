A consortium of Colombian and
Peruvian companies won a concession to build a highway requiring
an estimated $396 million of investment, the Peruvian government
said.  A group that included Colombian firms Pavimentos Colombia
SAS and Nexus Infraestructura SAS and Lima-based Chung & Tong
Ingenieros SAC beat out two other groups in the bidding,  Peru â€™s
private investment promotion agency said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The 25-year concession is to build and maintain a 430-
kilometer (267-mile) highway connecting Arequipa in the southern
highlands with the Chilean border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
