Mexico’s peso bonds posted their
biggest drop since March, following Treasuries lower, on bets
the  Federal Reserve  will put off more stimulus measures as the
world’s largest economy shows signs of strength.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 increased 10 basis points,
or 0.10 percentage point, to 5.54 percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico
City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell
1.08 centavo to 139.84 centavos per peso. The peso appreciated
0.3 percent to 13.1342 per dollar.  Mexico’s peso bonds slid along with Treasuries after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said yesterday that the Fed will hold
off in September from a third round of bond buying known as
quantitative easing. Industrial production in the U.S., the
destination of 80 percent of Mexican exports, gained last month
more than economists forecast, the Fed reported today.  “The Treasury trade being unwound in my eyes definitely
has to do with people that were overly enthusiastic about the
idea of getting quantitative easing,” said Alex Silva, who
manages and advises on about $800 million of emerging-market
assets including Mexican bonds at Silva Capital Management in
 Chicago . “Then there’s the ripple effect into other markets.”  The 15-day correlation coefficient between 10-year Mexican
 government bonds  and similar-maturity Treasuries today rose to
0.80, the highest level since 2004. A reading of 1 means the two
securities move in lockstep while -1 indicates they move in
opposite directions.  Peso’s Gains  The peso’s advance today boosted this year’s rally against
the dollar to 6.1 percent, the biggest among the 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. Mexico’s currency gained 0.7
percent against the yen today.  The central bank held its 2012 gross domestic product
forecast at 3.25 percent to 4.25 percent, according to a
presentation posted on its website today. It also left its 2013
growth forecast unchanged at 3 percent to 4 percent.  Banxico, as the central bank is known, said consumer prices
will rise 3 percent to 4 percent this year and next even after
inflation accelerated above that target, with prices climbing
4.42 percent in July from a year earlier. Rising global prices
for corn following a drought in the U.S. and an outbreak of
avian flu may keep some food prices high in the third quarter,
Banxico said.  Yields on inflation-linked bonds due in December 2013
increased seven basis points to 0.24 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
