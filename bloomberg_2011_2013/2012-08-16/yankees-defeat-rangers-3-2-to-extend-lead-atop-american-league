The New York Yankees logged their
third straight win over the Texas Rangers to extend their lead
atop the American League.  Freddy Garcia (7-5) allowed two runs --  Josh Hamilton ’s
33rd and 34th home runs of the Major League Baseball season --
in 6 2/3 innings as New York won 3-2 after a one hour, 52-minute
rain delay at Yankee Stadium last night.  The Yankees got all their runs in the third inning off
Texas starter Scott Feldman. Jayson Nix scored on  Nick Swisher ’s
double,  Derek Jeter  reached home on  Curtis Granderson ’s
sacrifice fly and Swisher added the third run on Eric Chavez’s
single.  Hamilton then blasted home runs in the fourth and sixth
innings for the Rangers.  Feldman (6-8) surrendered three runs on seven hits and
struck out seven in six innings.  The Yankees have won seven of their past eight games to
improve to 70-47, 2 1/2 games ahead of the second-place Rangers
(67-49) atop the AL.  The last game in the series is scheduled for today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
