An F-16 fighter jet crashed in
northern  Belgium  while on a training mission from the Kleine-
Brogel air base near the town of Peer, the country’s military
said. No one was injured.  The accident occurred at 3:01 p.m. local time about one
kilometer from the Kleine-Brogel base, the military said today
in an emailed statement. The pilot was able to eject and was
found safe, it said. No one else was hurt in the incident, 
Belga newswire reported.  An investigation is under way and  initial information 
indicates that a collision with birds could be the cause,
according to the statement by the military.  At least 37 of Belgium's F-16 aircraft have crashed in 
almost 35 years of service in the country, according to Belga. 
The nation ordered 160 of the planes in the 1970s and 1980s, 
the newswire said.  The mayor of Peer activated the town’s municipal disaster
plan after the accident, according to Belga.  The Kleine-Brogel air base is home to Belgium’s 10th
Tactical Wing, which has taken part in international crisis
missions in Bosnia,  Kosovo ,  Libya  and  Afghanistan  as well as
NATO defense missions, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
