Nigeria ’s naira rallied to the
strongest in more than nine months as commercial lenders sold
dollars to comply with regulations on foreign-exchange holdings
and foreign investors bought the nation’s debt.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer climbed as
much as 0.6 percent to 156.32 a dollar, the highest on a closing
basis since Oct. 25, 2011, and traded at 156.55 as of 1:21 p.m.
in Lagos, the commercial capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The naira has risen 3.4 percent this year, making it
the best performing currency in Africa after the Zambian kwacha.  “The naira has been supported by a confluence of factors
recently, including  central bank ’s restrictions at auctions,
dollar sales from international  oil companies  and foreign
inflows into fixed income markets,”  Alan Cameron , analyst at
London-based CSL Stockbroker Ltd., said today in an e-mailed
response to questions. “The central bank is committed to
keeping the naira stable at around current levels.”  The Central Bank of Nigeria last month reduced the amount
of foreign exchange banks can hold as a percentage of their
shareholders’ funds to 1 percent from 3 percent and increased
their  reserve requirements  to 12 percent of total assets from 8
percent. Nigeria sold 75 billion naira ($478 million) of bonds
at an auction yesterday, with bids at 249 billion naira, the
Abuja-based Debt Management Office said today on its website.  Yields on the West African country’s 16 percent domestic
debt due 2019 fell six basis points to 16.46 percent, according
to August 15 prices on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website. Borrowing costs on the nation’s $500 million of
Eurobonds due 2021 fell seven basis points to 4.994 percent
today.  Ghana ’s cedi strengthened 0.2 percent to 1.9415 a dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
