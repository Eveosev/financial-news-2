Platinum futures jumped the most
since June after production was disrupted at a South African
mine owned by  Lonmin Plc (LMI) , the world’s third-biggest producer,
increasing concern that supply will lag behind output this year.  A strike that led to deadly riots and shootings at the
Marikana mine has disrupted operations since Aug. 10. Eighteen
bodies were lying near the site of a recent protest, the South
African Press Association reported today.  Impala Platinum
Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the second-largest producer, lost 120,000 ounces
of platinum output during a strike in January and February,
according to Bloomberg calculations.  “These supply challenges may be sufficient in our view to
potentially push the market into deficit this year,”  Daniel Brebner , an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said in a note e-mailed
today.  Platinum futures for October delivery climbed 2.8 percent
to settle at $1,435.20 an ounce at 1:12 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the biggest gain for a most-active contract
since June 29. After the close of floor trading, the metal
climbed to $1,442.80, the highest since July 10.  For the first time since July 5, the settlement price
topped the 50-day moving average, a signal that some analysts
who follow historical price patterns perceive as bullish.  Palladium futures for September delivery advanced 0.9
percent to $583.45 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
