LCH Clearnet SA, the French arm of
 Europe ’s biggest clearing house, raised the deposits it demands
from clients to trade milling wheat and corn futures on NYSE
Liffe in Paris after prices jumped.  The margin for milling wheat futures will climb to 1,300
euros ($1,595) per contract from 1,200 euros, LCH.Clearnet wrote
in a  statement  on its website yesterday. Margin requirements for
corn will rise to 1,000 euros from 900 euros, the clearinghouse
said.  Milling wheat futures have climbed 33 percent in the French
capital this year to 259.25 euros a ton, while corn futures have
advanced 28 percent to 252.25 euros a ton.  The changes will come into effect with the margin call
tomorrow morning for positions at today’s close, LCH.Clearnet
