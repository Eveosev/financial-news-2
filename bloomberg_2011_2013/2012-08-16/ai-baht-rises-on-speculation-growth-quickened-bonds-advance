Thailand’s baht reached a one-week
low before data that is forecast to show exports dropped for a
second straight month in July.  Government bonds  rose.  Overseas shipments fell 2.7 percent in July from a year
earlier after a 4.24 percent slide the previous month, according
to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey
before a government report next week. Data on Aug. 14 showed
 euro-zone   gross domestic product  contracted 0.4 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier and industrial production
dropped 2.1 percent in June from the prior year.  Europe 
accounted for 8.7 percent of Thailand’s exports in the first
half of this year, official data show.  “If you look at the economic data from the euro zone, they
have been still sliding, and so we are still going to see some
weakness in Asian exports in coming months,” said Nalin Chutchotitham, a Bangkok-based analyst at  Kasikornbank Pcl. (KBANK)   The baht was little changed at 31.56 per dollar as of 3:52
p.m. in Bangkok after touching 31.59 earlier, the weakest level
since Aug. 8, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its
three-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, was little changed at 6.24
percent.  Government bonds snapped a two-day loss after data from the
Thai Bond Market Association showed global funds boosted
holdings of local  debt  by $152 million yesterday. The yield on
the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 fell one basis point to
3.13 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
