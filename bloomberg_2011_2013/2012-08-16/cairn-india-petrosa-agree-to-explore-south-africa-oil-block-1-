Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , operator of the
biggest Indian onshore oilfield, and South African state-run oil
company PetroSA agreed to jointly explore for crude and gas in
Block 1 of the Orange Basin on the maritime border with Namibia.  The agreement on the 19,922 square-kilometer (4.9 million
acre) block on South Africa’s west coast is subject to approval
from local regulators, the companies said today in a statement.  Cairn will hold 60 percent of the venture and PetroSA the
balance. P. Elango, director of strategy at Cairn India, said in
the statement the deal was “an important first step” for the
company’s expansion outside of the  Indian subcontinent .  To contact the reporter on this story:
