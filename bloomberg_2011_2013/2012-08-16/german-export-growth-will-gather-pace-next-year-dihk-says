German export growth will pick up
next year as the euro-area economy recovers from the sovereign
debt crisis, the DIHK chamber of industry and commerce said.  Exports will grow 6 percent in 2013 after expanding 4
percent this year, DIHK predicted in its world economic report
published in Berlin today. That’s still down from 8.2 percent
growth last year and a 13.7 percent gain in 2010, DIHK said.  Europe ’s biggest economy relies on exports, about 40
percent of which are sold to its partners in the 17-nation euro
area. With the debt crisis curbing government and household
spending across the region,  Germany ’s foreign sales are waning,
damping economic growth.  Still, DIHK said Germany is benefiting from demand in
emerging economies such as  China , Indonesia and Vietnam. The
country should regain its position as the world’s second-largest
exporter in 2013, with China retaining the lead and the U.S.
slipping to third, it said. German imports will also grow 4
percent this year and 6 percent next year, DIHK forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
