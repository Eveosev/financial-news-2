Sales at major South Korean
department stores fell for the second straight month in July as
Europe’s turmoil weakened confidence during the summer holiday
shopping season.  Outlays at the three biggest chains declined 1.3 percent in
July from a year earlier after a 2 percent drop in June, the
Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said in a statement today.
 Discount-store sales  slipped 8.2 percent last month, the report
showed.  Consumer confidence  fell to a five-month low in July, the
same month the Bank of Korea unexpectedly reduced its benchmark
rate to support growth. The central bank may cut again next
month, helping to support demand, said An Ki Tae, an economist
at Woori Investment & Security in Seoul.  “The decline in retail sales will probably bottom out this
month or next month,” An said. “The rate cut expected in the
third quarter wouldn’t fundamentally improve the domestic
economy, but it would ease some of the burden for households
that are in debt.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
