German 10-year bunds stayed higher
after data showed  euro-area inflation  was unchanged last month.  The yield on the securities fell two basis points to 1.55
percent at 10:05 a.m. London time. The yield on two-year notes
was little changed at minus 0.033 percent.  The inflation rate in the 17-nation single-currency bloc
remained at 2.4 percent from a year ago, the same as in June and
May, the European Unionâ€™s statistics office in Luxembourg said
today, confirming an initial estimate published on July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
