U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said Britain doesn’t recognize the concept of “diplomatic
asylum” and won’t allow Wikileaks founder Julian Assange safe
passage out of the country after Ecuador granted him political
asylum.  “We cannot give safe passage to someone in this
situation,” Hague told reporters in London today. “The U.K.
doesn’t accept the principle of diplomatic asylum.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
