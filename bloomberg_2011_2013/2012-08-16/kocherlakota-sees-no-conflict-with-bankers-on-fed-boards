Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis
President Narayana Kocherlakota said he sees no conflict of
interest arising from the fact that bankers serve on the boards
of the regional Fed banks.  “Isn’t it wrong, these critics say, to give bankers power
over those who are supposed to supervise them?” Kocherlakota
said in the text of prepared remarks today in Minot, North
Dakota. “It would be wrong if that were the case, but members
of the board of directors -- bankers or not -- have no say in
how Federal Reserve banks conduct their supervisory
operations.”  U.S. lawmakers including Senator  Bernie Sanders  of Vermont
want to ban bank employees from regional Fed boards, warning
about conflict of interest. Such representation came under
scrutiny after JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer
 Jamie Dimon , a board member at the  New York  Fed, revealed in May
what is now estimated to be at least $5.8 billion in trading
losses.  Sanders, an independent, introduced legislation in May that
would bar employees of bank holding companies or other firms
regulated by the Fed from serving on the boards of the 12
regional Fed banks.  Bankers provide regional Fed bank presidents with
information about credit conditions and the economy, which is
“precisely the kind of information that policy makers need to
do their job,” Kocherlakota said.  The Minneapolis Fed chief didn’t comment on the economy or
the outlook for monetary policy in his prepared remarks. He is
not a voting member of the policy-setting  Federal Open Market
Committee  this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
