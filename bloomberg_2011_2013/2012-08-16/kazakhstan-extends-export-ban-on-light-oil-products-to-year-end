Kazakhstan, the largest oil producer
in the former  Soviet Union  after  Russia , extended its ban on
exports of light oil products to the end of the year to curb
rising domestic fuel prices.  The government extended a ban due to expire July 1,
according to a decree published in the official Kazakhstanskaya
Pravda newspaper today and dated June 29. The measure was put in
place to prevent “a critical shortage and rise in
prices on the domestic oil-products market,” according to the
government order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
