Johannesburg’s Lions rugby team has
been dropped from next year’s Super Rugby tournament in favor of
Southern Kings from  South Africa ’s Eastern Cape province,
leaving the biggest city in the three competing nations without
a team.  The  Lions , which finished at the bottom of the South
African Conference in this year’s  Super Rugby  tournament, “will
have the chance to regain their status in 12 months’ time,” the
South African Rugby Union said in a  statement  on its website
today. The Kings franchise “contains numerous leading rugby
schools. It has been starved of top-class rugby competition for
a decade and a half and now it has the chance to show what it
can do.”  The annual Super Rugby tournament, which runs for about six
months, includes 15 teams with five teams each from South
Africa,  Australia  and  New Zealand . This year New Zealand’s
Chiefs won the tournament with South Africa’s Durban-based
Sharks coming second. The Lions came last out of the 15 teams,
winning only three of its 16 games. At the end of last year the
Lions won South Africa’s biggest rugby tournament, the Currie
Cup.  “This is a very unfortunate decision which will result in
a team taking part in a competition without needing to qualify
on rugby merits,” Lions President Kevin de Klerk said in a
 statement  on the rugby club’s website today. “ We are extremely
disappointed at this result. We will take time to consider this
decision and then to plan our response that best protects our
players, staff, stakeholders and supporters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
