Outokumpu Oyj (OUT1V) , the stainless-steel
maker that is  Finland ’s largest power user, will boost annual
consumption by 40 percent as it expands output at its Tornio
site in the north of the country.  Power use will rise by 1 terawatt-hour from a maximum 2.5
terawatt-hours currently, Saara Tahvanainen, a company
spokeswoman in Helsinki, said by telephone. That compares with
Finland’s total electricity use of 84.4 terawatt-hours last
year, according to the Finnish Energy Industries association.  The new capacity will start next year and full production
may be reached in 2014 as the company doubles ferrochrome output
capacity to 540,000 metric tons a year, Tahvanainen said.  Outokumpu’s Tornio site is the single largest power user in
Finland, which prompted the company to take part in the
development of a nuclear reactor as part of the Fennovoima Oyj
venture, Tahvanainen said. Fennovoima has a permit to build a
new nuclear power plant in Pyhaejoki in northern Finland. The
company will this year or next choose between reactor designs
from  Areva SA (AREVA)  and  Toshiba Corp. (6502)   “We want to obtain long-term, stable power output at a
predictable price,” Tahvanainen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
