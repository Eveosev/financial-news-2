South Africa recovered to reach 262-
7 at stumps on the opening day of the third and final cricket
Test against England as it seeks to replace the hosts at the top
of the world rankings.  Vernon Philander is on 46 and  Dale Steyn  has 21 at Lord’s
in London.  James Anderson  and  Steven Finn  took three wickets
each and wicketkeeper Matt Prior had four dismissals.  The visitors won the toss and slumped to 54-4 before lunch.
First Anderson had captain Graeme Smith caught behind for 14
runs, then Prior also caught Alviro Petersen (22) and Jacques Kallis (3) off Finn, who bowled Hashim Amla for 13.  AB  de Villiers  and Jacques Rudolph put on 51 for the fifth
wicket before Anderson dismissed De Villiers for 27, leaving the
visitors on 105-5. Rudolph and JP Duminy then added 58 runs and
Graeme Swann broke through, bowling Rudolph for 42.  After a partnership of 72, Anderson made it 235-7 when
Duminy, on 61, edged to Prior shortly after England took the new
ball. Anderson took 3-58 and Finn had figures of 3-68.  South Africa leads 1-0 and will replace England as the No.
1 team in the International Cricket Council Test rankings with a
series victory.  England captain  Andrew Strauss  is playing in his 100th Test
after the buildup to the match was overshadowed by controversy
surrounding  Kevin Pietersen .  The South African-born batsman was dropped by England after
he sent text messages to opposing players. He’s apologized to
Strauss and his team for what he described as “what you might
call provocative texts” that were meant as “banter between
close friends.”  The texts contained “less than flattering” comments about
Strauss and his teammates, the Daily Mail reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
