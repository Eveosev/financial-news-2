Ethanol fell for the first time in
three days on speculation the market is oversupplied.  Prices slipped a day after the Energy Department said
 inventories  in the week ended Aug. 10 were 18.4 million barrels,
up 4.9 percent from a year earlier. Output rose a third
consecutive week to 819,000 barrels a day, the longest string of
increases since May 18.  “Production was up,” said  Ian Jackson , a trader at SCB &
Associates LLC in Chicago. “That’s going to keep pressure on
the market until we see some serious shutdowns.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 0.2 cent to
settle at $2.587 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices
have gained 17 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  was unchanged
at $2.64 a gallon and in Chicago the additive lost 0.5 cent to
$2.56, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased 0.5 cent to $2.63 and on
the West Coast the additive dropped 1 cent to $2.745.  Production has fallen 15 percent from a record 963,000
barrels a day as companies temper operations because of more
expensive corn prices caused by drought.  Corn for December delivery jumped 3.5 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $8.075 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
