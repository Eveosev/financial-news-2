An executive of Tokyo-based Yazaki
Corp. agreed to plead guilty for his role in a conspiracy to fix
prices of auto components sold in cars in the U.S., the  Justice
Department  said.  Toshio Sudo, a Japanese national, was charged with engaging
in a conspiracy to rig bids and prices for instrument panel
clusters, also known as meters, made by the closely held
company, the Justice Department said today in an e-mailed
statement.  Sudo agreed to serve a 14-month jail sentence in the U.S.,
pay a $20,000 fine and cooperate with the continuing probe into
bid rigging and price fixing in the auto-parts industry.  Including todayâ€™s plea agreement, the Justice Department
has charged seven companies, 11 people and secured fines for
more than $785 million in connection with antitrust violations
in the industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
