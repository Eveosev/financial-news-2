CX Solar Korea is leading a group
that signed an agreement with the government of  Pakistan  to
build a 300-megawatt solar farm that will require an investment
of as much as $900 million.  The group plans to start a 50-megawatt installation near
Quetta in southwestern Balochistan province that will use a
combination of crystalline silicon and thin-film panels to see
which perform best, said Moon-sok Choi, chief executive of CX
Solar, a Seoul-based project developer.  The group expects to build 300 megawatts by 2016, Choi
said. The power will be sold under a 25-year contract, with
details still being negotiated, Choi said in an e-mailed
response to questions.  CX Solar is in talks with panel suppliers, including
Bernin, France-based  Soitec SA (SOI) , which makes Concentrix
photovoltaic panels, Choi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
