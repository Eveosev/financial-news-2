Bahrain’s Lower  Criminal Court

years’ imprisonment after finding him guilty of calling for and
participating in unauthorized marches and gatherings,  Alwatan 
reported on its website.  The High Criminal Court postponed until Aug. 23 a ruling in
another case in which Rajab has been convicted for insulting the
