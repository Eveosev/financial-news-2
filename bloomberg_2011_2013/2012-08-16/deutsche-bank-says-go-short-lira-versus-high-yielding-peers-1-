Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  said it is “less
constructive” on the Turkish lira due to diminished carry and
recommended shorting the currency against “high yielding”
currencies of India, Mexico and South Africa.  The lira weakened 0.3 percent this month against the
dollar to trade at 1.7997 per dollar at 10:15 a.m. in Istanbul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
