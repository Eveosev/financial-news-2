The U.K.’s longest running comic
book, the Dandy, will print its last weekly edition to mark the
75th anniversary in December, after which characters such as
Desperate Dan and Korky the Cat move online.  “On Dec. 4th we’ll publish our 75th anniversary edition --
and now that the cat’s out of the bag, I can confirm that this
will be our last print edition,” Ellis Watson, head of
magazines and newspapers at publisher DC Thomson & Co., said
today in a statement. “It’s what comes online then that will
set the tone for the next 75 years.”  The Dandy ’s most famous characters are Desperate Dan, a
cowboy who can lift a cow with one hand and eats cow pies, and
Korky the Cat, a black-and-white cat with a trademark red nose.
Privately held DC Thomson, based in Dundee,  Scotland , said it is
developing its magazine business to make it more efficient.  “Dan has certainly not eaten his last cow pie,” Watson
said.  The last edition will include a reprint of the first-ever
Dandy, initially published in December 1937.  A book commemorating the 75th anniversary premiered at the
Edinburgh International Book Festival this week. The Dandy will
feature in exhibitions at the National Library of Scotland and
The Cartoon Museum, DC Thomson said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
