Orange-juice  futures fell after
independent forecaster Elizabeth Steger said the orange crop in
Florida, the world’s second-biggest citrus grower, will be
bigger next year.  The state’s output in the season starting Oct. 1 may rise
to 156.7 million boxes, according to Steger, the founder of
Citrus Consulting International in Kissimmee, Florida. In the
previous year, production reached 146.5 million boxes, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. The  agency  will release its
first projection for the next crop on Oct. 11. One box weighs 90
pounds, or 41 kilograms.  “The figure did put some pressure on the market,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president for Price Futures Group in  Chicago ,
said in a telephone interview.  Orange juice for November delivery declined 1.2 percent to
settle $1.0805 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York. Prices have tumbled 36 percent in 2012.  About 4,634 contracts were traded today, the most since
June 22. Prices climbed as much as 5.8 percent and tumbled as
much as 5 percent.  Traders expected “between 145 million and 160 million
boxes,”  Michael McDougall , a senior vice president at Newedge
Group in New York, said in an e-mail.  “Steger’s numbers are highly regarded,” Sterling Smith, a
futures specialist at Citigroup Inc.’s institutional client
group in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
