Gold demand fell 7.1 percent in the
second quarter as investment slid and Asian jewelry purchases
declined amid higher local prices and concern about economic
growth, the  World Gold Council  said.  Global demand dropped to 990 metric tons in the quarter
compared with 1,065.8 tons a year earlier, as investment slid 23
percent and jewelry fell 15 percent, the London-based industry
group said today in a report. Jewelry consumption should pick up
in  Asia  during the second half this year on seasonal wedding and
festival purchases and as economic growth improves, it said.  Gold fell 4.3 percent in London in the second quarter as
commodities plunged the most since 2008 and investors favored
the dollar amid mounting concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis and
global expansion. Investors are still holding a near-record
amount in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  and central banks
will buy close to 500 tons this year after adding the most to
reserves since becoming net buyers in 2009, the council said.  “Gold persisted to be very expensive for Indian consumers
because of the weak rupee and that’s choked off demand,” Marcus Grubb, managing director of investment research at the council,
said yesterday by phone from  London . “The continuing economic
problems around the world have started to rekindle expectations
of some easing of policy. With a seasonal likelihood of stronger
demand in  India  and then in China, the second half is going to
be stronger than the first half for the gold market.”  Gold Prices  Gold for immediate delivery traded at $1,603 an ounce at
3:33 p.m. yesterday in London, up 2.5 percent this year. Prices
averaged $1,611.88 in the second quarter, up 6.8 percent from a
year earlier and 4.7 percent lower than the first quarter.  World investment, including gold bars, coins and exchange-
traded products fell to 302 tons in the three months through
June, the council said. Coin and bar demand accounted for the
bulk of investment, with ETP holdings little changed, the report
showed. European bar and coin demand rose 15 percent to 77.6
tons, the data show.  Nations from  Russia  to  Ukraine  to  Kazakhstan  added to their
gold holdings this year. Central banks bought 157.5 tons in the
quarter, compared with 66.2 tons a year earlier, the council
said. That took first-half additions to 254.2 tons.  Jewelry use slipped to 418.3 tons in the second
quarter from 490.6 tons a year earlier, the council said.
Jewelry demand from India, 2011’s biggest buyer, plunged 30
percent to 124.8 tons, accounting for 30 percent of the global
total. A weaker rupee versus the dollar meant that average local
second-quarter bullion prices in India were 29 percent higher
than a year earlier, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Indian
jewelers held a strike in March and April to protest government
taxes on imports.  Indian Demand  Total Indian demand was 181.3 tons in the latest quarter,
25 percent more than  China ’s, the biggest buyer the previous two
quarters. The council reiterated its prediction that China will
become the top consumer this year on an annual basis, with
demand reaching almost 850 tons versus about 700 tons for India.  Mine output rose 0.4 percent to 706.4 tons in the second
quarter from a year earlier, the council said. Scrap supply
declined 12 percent to 363.7 tons in the period, the lowest
level since the first quarter last year.  “It’s expectation of a higher price in the future,” Grubb
said, referring to the drop in scrap production. “The easy
recycling has been done. You need a higher price to tempt more
out.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
