Warner Music  Group Corp. was sued by
George Gershwin’s heirs over claims they’re owed $4.5 million in
royalties and interest from works of the late composer of
“Rhapsody in Blue” and “Porgy and Bess.”  The claims relate to the rental of Gershwin’s works outside
the U.S. and  Canada , worldwide licensing of ballets, worldwide
licensing of concert grand rights and Warner Music’s failure to
register copyrights in a timely manner, according to the
complaint filed Jan. 11 in  New York  state court in Manhattan.  The heirs, including a nephew and niece of George and Ira Gershwin, said in the complaint that in 2007 they reviewed
Warner Music’s books and records, which they said revealed
“significant non-payments and/or underpayments of royalties and
other amounts” as well as other contractual breaches.  The heirs are also conducting two other examinations
related to other “worldwide and traditional income issues” and
may bring additional claims, they said in the complaint.  James Steven, a spokesman for Warner Music, declined to
comment yesterday on the lawsuit.  The case is Marc George Gershwin v. WB Music Corp.,
650117/2013, New York State Supreme Court, County of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
