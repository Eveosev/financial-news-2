Gafisa SA (GFSA3) ,  Brazil ’s fourth-biggest
homebuilder by revenue, led its peers higher as sales almost
tripled in the last quarter of 2012.  Shares rallied 5.1 percent to 5.15 reais at 12:30 p.m. in
 Sao Paulo . It was the best performance on the BM&FBovespa Real
Estate index, which gained 0.2 percent.  Sales jumped to 905.2 million reais ($444 million) in the
three months through December from 338.4 million reais in the
same period of 2011, Gafisa said in a regulatory filing on
preliminary quarterly results after the market closed yesterday.  “Although the company was hurt again by client
cancellations in its low-income division, sales speed was a
positive surprise,” David Lawant, Enrico Trotta and Vivian Salomon, analysts at the investment bank Itau BBA, wrote in a
note to clients published today. They have a buy recommendation
on the stock, with the 12-month price target of 6.40 reais.  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3)  advanced as much as 4.6 percent
to 3.83 reais, the highest intraday level since Oct. 24, after
reporting late yesterday that sales in the fourth quarter of
2012 met its guidance at 1.1 billion reais. That is a 17 percent
decline from the same period a year earlier.  Even Construtora e Incorporadora SA  gained 1 percent to
9.48 reais. The homebuilder’s new projects soared 72 percent to
1.2 billion reais in the fourth quarter from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
