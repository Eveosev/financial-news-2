Fuji Heavy (7270)  Industries Ltd., the
maker of Subaru cars, targets a 6 percent increase in global
sales, spurred by the introduction of a new Forester SUV model
and demand for its Impreza and XV crossover vehicles.  Deliveries will probably rise to 750,000 in 2013 from
706,612 last year, the carmaker said today in a statement. Sales
in China will climb about 32 percent to 57,500 units.  The Tokyo-based automaker will use an existing line in the
U.S. to increase output, including production of a new model in
2016, President Yasuyuki Yoshinaga told reporters in  Tokyo . It
will announce details at the end of March on the plan to boost
production, he said.  Fuji Heavy will raise output at its Lafayette,  Indiana ,
factory, Yoshinaga said. Sales in the U.S., its largest market,
rose 20 percent in 2012 to a record, led by the Impreza
hatchback. A boost in U.S. capacity is key to the company’s mid-
term target through March 2016, which includes 380,000
deliveries to the U.S. out of 850,000 shipments worldwide.  The Lafayette plant opened in 1989, initially as a joint
venture with truckmaker  Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202)  It currently makes
Outback wagons, Legacy sedans and Tribeca sport-utility vehicles
as well as Camry sedans for Toyota Motor Corp. under contract.  The factory can produce a maximum of 310,000 vehicles
annually, based on state air-pollution limits, Jennifer McGarvey, a spokeswoman for the factory, said last month.  Michael McHale, a company spokesman, has said 50,000 units
of production capacity would be added should Impreza hatchback
or Forester SUV production be moved to Indiana.  Fuji Heavy advanced 0.5 percent to 1,181 yen as of 2:47
p.m. in Tokyo trading. The shares more than doubled last year,
the best performer on  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock
Average, as the automaker’s lack of manufacturing plants in
 China  shielded the company from the sales slump in the country
relative to Toyota, Nissan Motor Co. and Honda Motor Co. A
weaker yen also boosted the share price.  To contact the reporters on this story:
