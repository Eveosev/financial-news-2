South Korea ’s won traded near a 17-
month high, reflecting dollar weakness after Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  warned of the consequences of failure to
raise the U.S. debt ceiling.  The Dollar Index, a gauge of the greenback’s strength,
approached the lowest level in more than a week after Geithner
said not increasing the limit by early March would impose
“severe economic hardship.” South Korea’s government may curb
 exchange-rate  volatility further and recent movements in the won
may have been too fast, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said at a
conference yesterday in  Hong Kong .  The won closed little changed at 1,056.55 per dollar in
Seoul, compared with 1,056.13 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 1,054.49 earlier, the highest
level since August 2011, after rallying 8.3 percent in 2012, the
best performance among the 11 most-traded Asian currencies.  “The won earlier erased yesterday’s decline as investors
bet South Korean authorities haven’t yet taken action to stem
the won’s rise,” said Yoo Hyen Jo, an analyst at Shinhan
Investment Corp. in  Seoul . “Still, further gains are likely to
be limited as any volatile movement in the won could prompt
authorities to act.”  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo said yesterday the
nation will take an “active” response on the won if needed.
Measures to slow the won’s appreciation could include
“smoothing operations,” Kim said, adding authorities should
act to normalize the exchange rate. Global investors sold $92
million more South Korean stocks than they bought yesterday,
exchange data show.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due September
2017 dropped four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
2.84 percent, according to Korea Exchange prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
