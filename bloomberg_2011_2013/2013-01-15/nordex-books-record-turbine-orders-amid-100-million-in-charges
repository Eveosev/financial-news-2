Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind-turbine
maker, said it took in record orders last year in  Europe  even as
changes at units in the U.S. and  China  are expected to result in
charges of as much as 75 million euros ($100 million).  Nordex recorded 628 million euros of new orders in the
fourth quarter as total new business for the year rose 15
percent to about 1.27 billion euros, the Hamburg-based company
said today in a statement. Liquidity increased 28 percent to 273
million euros, it said.  Last month the company said it would cut 130 positions and
stop making rotor blades at its plant in China in response to
weak demand. It also seeks to begin making a profit at its U.S.
unit, which contributed 5 percent of new business last year,
Nordex said. Today the manufacturer announced it expects a one-
time expense of 60 million to 75 million euros for 2012 “in
connection with the planned structural adjustments in the  United
States  and China.”  Wind-turbine makers across the globe have reduced prices to
compete for orders with their Asian peers as U.S. and European
governments cut clean-energy incentives to curb budget deficits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
