The  Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
expanded its counterparties in reverse-repurchase agreements for
use when policy makers eventually drain the record amount of
cash they added to the financial system.  The Fed added 13 additional banks, government-sponsored
enterprises, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank of  Boston , and
money funds to its list of approved reverse-repo counterparties.
The New York Fed posted the firms added on its  website  today.  The central bank began in 2010 expanding counterparties
beyond its primary dealers in a plan to increase its future
capacity and ability to withdraw the unprecedented amount of
liquidity it has added to the financial system since global
financial crisis in 2008.  In a reverse repo, the Fed lends securities for a set
period, draining cash from the banking system. At maturity, the
securities are returned to the Fed, and the cash to the primary
dealers. In a tri-party repo, a clearing bank acts as a third
party to make sure there’s adequate collateral behind the repo
and that it conforms throughout the life of the transaction to
the investor’s requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
