Canadian  stocks  rose for a sixth
day, the longest stretch since November, as gold producers
advanced as the price of the metal increased amid concerns about
U.S. debt ceiling discussions.  Centerra Gold Inc. (CG)  climbed 6.6 percent after its gold
production forecast was almost double from last year.  Barrick
Gold Corp. (ABX)  and Goldcorp Inc. added at least 1 percent as gold
rose for a second day.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC)  lost 1.4 percent
after Bank of Montreal analysts lowered their rating on the
stock.  Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LLL) , the Canadian yoga-wear
retailer, sank 4.1 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange after
forecasting fourth-quarter sales that trailed analysts’
estimates.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 38.88
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,641.97 at 4 p.m. in Toronto. The
benchmark gauge has gained 1.7 percent this year. Trading volume
was 6.5 percent higher than the 30-day average at this time of
the day.  “The one thing that’s holding up the TSX Index today is
material stocks, in particular the gold sector,” Youssef Zohny,
a portfolio manager with Stenner Investment Partners of 
Richardson GMP Ltd., said on the phone from Vancouver. Richardson
GMP manages about C$16 billion ($16.3 billion). “We’re seeing
Republicans and Democrats start to dig in with their upcoming
debt ceiling fights in February and March and that’s helping
 gold prices  today.”  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  warned
yesterday of severe economic hardship should Congress fail to
raise the debt ceiling that lawmakers have increased or revised
79 times since 1960, including 49 times under Republican
presidents. President  Barack Obama  vowed he won’t negotiate over
raising the government’s debt ceiling.  Centerra Rises  Centerra Gold Inc. rallied 6.6 percent to C$10. The company
said 2013 gold production will be between 605,000 and 660,000
ounces, almost double its 2012 gold production of 387,076
ounces.  Barrick, the world’s largest producer of gold, gained 1.1
percent to C$34.03 and Goldcorp, the second-largest, rose 1.1
percent to C$36.83.  Gold for February delivery advanced 0.9 percent to
$1,683.90 an ounce in New York. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman
 Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that while the economy is
responding to monetary stimulus “there is still quite a ways to
go.”  Manulife Shares  Manulife, Canada’s largest insurer, fell 1.4 percent to
C$14.12. Tom Mackinnon, analyst with BMO Capital Markets, cut
his rating for Manulife to market perform from outperform due to
valuation after a 20 percent rally in the past two months.  The shares trade at 25.1 times reported earnings, more than
twice the multiple for a group of financials in the S&P/TSX,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lululemon slumped 4.1 percent to C$68.24 on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. The company, which has posted double-digit gains
in same-store sales for 13 straight quarters, yesterday said it
expects a high single-digit increase.  Revenue for the quarter will be at the “high end” of its
original forecast of $475 million to $480 million, the company
said. Analysts  projected  $489 million, according to the average
of 22 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Celestica Inc. (CLS) , an electronic components manufacturer,
dropped 1.6 percent to C$8.17. Gus Papageorgiou, an analyst with
Bank of  Nova Scotia , cut his recommendation on the stock to
sector perform from sector outperform, citing its valuation
relative to peers. The stock is up 23 percent  since  touching a
three-year low in October.  To contact the reporters on this story:
