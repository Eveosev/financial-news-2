European Commission President  Jose Barroso  said regulations to create a single bank supervisor at
the  European Central Bank  are proceeding quickly.  “I hope making the final step for formal adoption is a
matter of weeks, not months,” he said in the text of a speech
to the European Parliament in Strasbourg,  France . Parliament
members have worked “very efficiently” with the council of
European nations to speed up work on the issue, he said today.  The European Central Bank is slated to become the single
supervisor for euro-area banks around March 1, 2014, a year
after regulations are set to establish oversight operations. The
new supervisor is one condition for allowing the 500 billion-
euro ($667 billion) European Stability Mechanism to lend
directly to banks.  The Brussels-based commission will move swiftly on other
banking measures such as  capital requirements , deposit-insurance
standards and how to handle failing lenders, Barroso said. The
commission, the European Union’s executive arm, plans to
introduce a proposal on handling failing firms after the single-
supervisor regulations are finished, he said.  “The commission will make a formal legislative proposal
for a single resolution mechanism in the banking sector before
the summer,” Barroso said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
