Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of
America Corp. and  Nomura (8604)  Holdings Inc. are predicting Japanese
stocks will extend their longest  streak  of gains in 23 years as
extra economic stimulus boost earnings.  The Topix Index,  Japan ’s broadest gauge of share
performance, rose for nine straight weeks through Jan. 11, the
longest stretch since  December 1989 (TPX) , when it hit a record
2,886.5. Goldman Sachs boosted its estimate to 1,000 on Jan. 7
from 930, while Bank of America increased its 12-month estimate
to 1,250 from 1,050, according to a Jan. 11 note from Tokyo-
based chief equity strategist Naoki Kamiyama. That’s a gain of
39 percent from the last close of 898.69.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced 10.3 trillion yen ($116
billion) in additional stimulus measures on Jan. 11 and is
pressuring the Bank of Japan to double its inflation target to 2
percent after the third recession in five years. Goldman Sachs
is buying shares of exporters, financial firms and utilities,
Hiroyuki Ito, Tokyo-based head of equity investment at Goldman
Sachs Asset Management Co., said last month.  “Abe is not just talk, but is about action,”  Jesper Koll ,
head of equity research at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in  Tokyo , said
Jan. 11. “In his first 30 days, it’s really quite impressive in
that you have a concrete supplementary spending.”  Koll has a 12-month target of 1,050 for the Topix. Analysts
surveyed in December said the Topix would rise to 905 by year-
end, according to the median of 14 estimates. Predictions have
been revised up after Abe’s  Liberal Democratic Party  was
returned to power at Dec. 16 elections. The Topix increased 0.8
percent to 906.22 today.  Earnings Boost  All 33 industries on the Topix advanced since Nov. 14.
Securities companies led, as Nomura, the country’s biggest
brokerage, jumped 72 percent and  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601) 
surged 49 percent as the market rallied. Gauges of shipping
companies and iron and steel manufacturers recorded the second-
and third-biggest  increases .  A weaker yen and Abe’s stimulus policies will boost
earnings, according to a Jan. 7 note from Goldman Sachs analysts
led by chief Japan strategist Kathy Matsui. The yen fell below
89 to the  U.S. dollar  last week and is trading at its lowest
level since June 2010. The currency has declined 11 percent
since the election was announced.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average will advance 9.7 percent to
11,860 by year end, Jefferies Group Inc. analysts led by  Sean
Darby , chief global equity strategist said Jan. 10, citing
improving trade ties with  China  as a catalyst for earnings.  “Earnings are forecast to rise more than 20 percent in
fiscal 2013 and Japanese stocks remain relatively cheap,” said
Masahiro Fukuda, investment director at Fidelity Worldwide
Investment in Tokyo. “Even before talk on Abe-nomics began,
Japanese stocks could’ve rebounded to this level without
counting the impact of a rapid drop in the yen on earnings.
Valuation justifies further gains when you take a weaker yen
into account.”  1983 Levels  Income per share on the Topix Index will climb  56 percent 
in the next year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with a 13 percent increase for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 27 percent for the Shanghai Composite
Index, the data show.  The Topix trades for 1.06 times book value, up from 0.82
times the value of net assets in June, the lowest ever,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1993. The
gauge closed at 695.51 on June 4, a level not seen since 1983.  Nakayama Steel Works Ltd. (5408) , which gets all its revenue from
Japan, almost doubled in value during the nine-week rally,
surging 97 percent and leading gains by makers of the material
on speculation Abe will pursue greater public-works spending.  Export Prospects  Nippon Yusen K.K. (9101) , Japan’s biggest shipping line by market
value, added 42 percent as the yen’s decline and signs of
recovery in the economies of China and the U.S. boosted the
propects for exports. Progress in halting the spread of  Europe ’s
debt crisis also improved the outlook for the company, which
receives 39 percent of revenue from routes to the continent.  I’rom Holdings Co. (2372) , a supplier of equipment and management
services to medical institutions, gained the most among the
Topix’s 1,687 members, surging 224 percent from Nov. 14. Kubotek
Corp., a maker of  inspection systems  for display manufacturers
including  South Korea ’s Samsung Electronics Co., recorded the
second-biggest advance, jumping 178 percent.  This isn’t the first time analysts have called for a rally
in Japanese shares.  A surge from November 2010 through the start of 2011 was
cut short by the March 11 earthquake. Forecasts for a recovery
in share prices on the back of reconstruction spending were
dashed as the government of former Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda 
proved unable to restart the economy. The yen rose as Europe’s
sovereign-debt crisis and an uneven recovery in the U.S
conspired sent investors in search of safer assets.  Growth Challenge  “Expectations for policy action will lead the market, but
I’m not sure how much impact it will actually have on
earnings,” said said Shintaro Shinohara, who helps oversee
about 11 trillion yen ($124 billion) as the head of equity
investment at Prudential Investment Management Japan Co. “It’s
not going to be a one-way rally. Globally, Europe’s growth will
be about 1 percent, the U.S. faces uncertainty and China’s not
going to expand as fast as previously.”  Japan faces domestic problems as well. More than 25 percent
of people are older than 65 and the country’s government debt
has balooned to 185 percent of gross domestic product. The
country’s shares trade about 70 percent below their 1989 level.  Of the stimulus package announced Jan. 11, about 3.8
trillion yen will be for disaster prevention and reconstruction,
with 3.1 trillion yen directed to stimulating private investment
and other measures, according to a statement released by the
Cabinet Office. Extra spending will increase gross domestic
product by about 2 percentage points and create about 600,000
jobs, the government said.  Game Changer  Japan’s currency slid below 120 per euro yesterday for the
first time since May 2011 after Abe said he wanted someone “who
can push through bold monetary policy” as the next  Bank of
Japan (8301)  governor. The BOJ meets next week.  “This year may become a game-changing year for Japanese
stocks,” said Takashi Ito, an equity strategist at Nomura in
Tokyo. “The new government are aiming to support corporate
growth and let Japanese companies lead the Japanese economy.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
