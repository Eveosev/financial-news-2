Housing Finance Ltd. (HFCL) ,  Kenya ’s only
publicly traded mortgage lender, climbed to the highest level in
almost 16 months as AIB Capital Ltd. started coverage on the
stock with a buy recommendation.  The shares advanced 3.9 percent to 17.50 shillings by 1:19
p.m. in Nairobi, the highest intraday price since Sept. 22,
2011. About 144,000 shares, or 122 percent of the three-month
daily average volume, changed hands, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Lower interest rates in Kenya will help Housing Finance
increase lending and boost income, according to AIB. The Central
Bank of Kenya’s Monetary Policy Committee, led by central bank
Governor Njuguna Ndung’u, reduced the rate for the fourth time
since July last week, cutting it to 9.5 percent from 11 percent.  “We have been seeing that investors are taking early
positions in financial companies ahead of announcement of
earnings,” Ted Macharia, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
AIB Capital, said by phone today. AIB has a price target of 21
shillings a share.  Housing Finance’s net income in the nine months to Sept. 30
slipped to 396 million shillings ($4.57 million) from 407
million shillings a year earlier, it said Oct. 29. The company
reported a 26 percent increase in non-performing loans, which it
attributed to higher interest rates, saying the situation was
improving as rates were reduced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
