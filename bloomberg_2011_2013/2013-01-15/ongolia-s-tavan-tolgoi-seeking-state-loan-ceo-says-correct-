(Corrects spelling of executives name in second paragraph
of story originally published Jan. 11.)  Mongolia’s Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi LLC,
the country’s largest state-owned coal company, is seeking a
$400 million to $500 million government loan to repay debt and
build infrastructure, its chief executive officer said.  “Our financial situation is very complicated at the moment
and we have to cover our debts and finance all our
infrastructure projects and operations,” Yaichil Batsuuri, a
former member of Parliament who has led Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi
since October, said in a telephone interview yesterday.  Erdenes Tavan Tolgoi, which signed a $250 million contract
in July 2011 to supply coal to companies including  Aluminum
Corp. of China Ltd. , gave about 300 billion tugrik ($214
million) to the government’s Human Development Fund in 2011 and
2012, the UB Post newspaper  reported  in September, citing the
company’s then chief executive Baasangombo Enebish. The fund
hands out cash to Mongolian citizens as part of a government
effort to redistribute the nation’s mining wealth.  The mining company is developing Mongolia’s Tavan Tolgoi
area, the nation’s largest coal field, with 6.4 billion metric
tons of reserves. It’s also preparing for an initial public
offering overseas, which has been postponed at least twice
because of market conditions and a lack of laws to regulate its
equity offering.  Mongolia’s government has promised every citizen 1,072
shares of common stock in the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
