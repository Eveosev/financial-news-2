Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell
after a data showed inventories gained for a third week,
boosting concern that rising supplies in  China , the biggest
consumer, will outpace demand as winter slows construction.  Rebar for May delivery dropped as much as 0.9 percent to
3,969 yuan ($638) a metric ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange
before trading at 3,988 yuan a ton at 11:29 a.m. local time.
Futures gained 2 percent yesterday, the most at close since Dec.
25, on speculation  China’s economy  is accelerating.  Rebar  inventory  in China rose for a third week to 5.8
million tons on Jan. 11, the highest since Oct. 12, according to
data from Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co. Spot
prices fell for a third day yesterday, according to Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  “There isn’t enough demand to sustain current prices,” Yu
Yang, an analyst at Shenyin Wanguo Futures Co., said by phone
from Shanghai. “The market is back to the dull fundamentals
after having digested the bullish euphoria over future demand.”  Futures rose yesterday after a Bloomberg survey showed
China’s economic growth may have recovered to 7.8 percent in the
fourth quarter from a year earlier, after sliding to a three-
year low of 7.4 percent in the previous quarter. The official
data is due on Jan. 18.  The average spot  price  for rebar fell 0.3 percent to 3,739
 yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike.
Spot  iron ore  at Tianjin port dropped 0.2 percent to $154.60 a
dry ton, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
