Senator  Barbara Boxer , a California
Democrat, said today she intends to back the nomination of
former Nebraska Republican Senator Chuck Hagel to be the next
U.S. defense secretary.  Boxer said her decision came after speaking with Hagel by
telephone last week and receiving a written response today to
her questions, according to an e-mailed statement from her
office.  “He has pledged without reservation” to support President
 Barack Obama ’s policies, Boxer said in the statement, “policies
that I believe have made our world safer and our alliances
stronger.”  Boxer said that she asked Hagel about several issues,
including Iran and U.S. relations with Israel, as well as
treatment of women and gays in the military. “His answers were
reassuring and show a sensitivity and understanding,” she said
in the statement.  Obama nominated Hagel, a Vietnam War veteran, to succeed
 Leon Panetta  as defense secretary. His nomination has already
run into opposition from Republicans, including Senators Lindsey
Graham of South Carolina and  John Cornyn  of Texas.   Hagel’s critics have focused their questions on whether he
sufficiently supports Israel and stepped-up U.S. sanctions on
Iran, as well as on his previous remarks about the “bloated”
 defense budget .  Hagel, 66, apologized on Dec. 21 for comments he made in
1998 questioning whether an “openly, aggressively gay” person
could properly represent the U.S. as an ambassador.  To contact the reporter on this story:
