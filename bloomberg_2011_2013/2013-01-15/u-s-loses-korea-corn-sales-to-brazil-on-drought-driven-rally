South Korea, the world’s third-
biggest buyer of corn, more than halved imports from the U.S. as
it turned to cheaper suppliers led by Brazil and  Argentina .  Shipments of American corn tumbled to a seven-year low of
2.84 million metric tons last year, from 6.02 million tons in
2011, according to  data  on the Korea Customs Service’s website
today. Imports from Brazil jumped to 1.96 million tons from
122,704 tons, while purchases from Argentina rose to 1.08
million tons from 1,957 tons, the data show.  Corn surged to a record $8.49 a bushel in  Chicago  on Aug.
10 last year as drought ravaged crops in the U.S., the top
exporter. Prices then tumbled 18 percent by the end of the year
as U.S. exports slowed and buyers sought cheaper supply. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. reiterated yesterday its forecast that corn
will rise to $8.25 a bushel in three months, saying better U.S.
weather is needed for a recovery in the next crop.  “Korean buyers last year shunned U.S. supplies because of
the price surge triggered by the drought, and, coincidently,
 Latin America  had a  bumper crop ,” Lee Tae Woong, a deputy
general manager at Nonghyup Feed Inc., the nation’s biggest
feed-grain buyer, said in a telephone interview today. “We
expect buyers to continue to seek non-U.S. supplies this year.”  Corn for March delivery were little changed at $7.245 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:05 p.m. in  Seoul . The
price is up 3.8 percent this year after climbing 8 percent last
year, the fourth straight yearly advance.  ‘Diversifying’  U.S. corn supply accounted for 35 percent of South Korea’s
corn imports in 2012, the lowest level since 2005 and down from
78 percent in 2011 and 85 percent in 2010, customs data show.  “Farmers in  Brazil  and Argentina may keep boosting corn
output as prices remain high,” Lee said. “In the longer term,
Korean buyers will continue diversifying import sources, and it
might be difficult to see the U.S. regaining 80 to 90 percent
share.”  Brazilian corn and soybean shipments from Paranagua, the
country’s biggest grains and oilseeds port, will rise as much as
14 percent this year on large crops, the port said earlier this
month. Argentina’s corn crop may jump 21 percent to a record
25.5 million tons this year after warm, dry weather since the
end of December helped planting of the grain, the  United
Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization said on Jan. 14.  South Korea ’s corn imports rose to 8.22 million tons from
7.76 million tons last year, the customs data show. Shipments
from Ukraine jumped to 897,339 tons in 2012 from none in 2011.
The Asian nation’s feed-corn purchases increased to 6.04 million
tons from 5.67 million tons, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
