Air travel  in Dallas, home to the
fourth-busiest U.S. airport, is returning to normal after a
winter storm snarled schedules for  AMR Corp.’s (AAMRQ)  American Airlines
as well as  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)   American and its American Eagle regional unit canceled 343
flights, many at Dallas- Fort Worth  International. Southwest,
which temporarily suspended operations at Love Field, said it
was able to resume before scrubbing any flights.  Cancellations at Dallas Fort-Worth, which served 57.8
million passengers in 2011, can ripple through the rest of the
nation’s air travel system. American, based in Fort Worth,
Texas, is the third-largest carrier in the U.S., and Southwest
is fourth biggest.  “The weather seems to be improving here by the hour, as is
our operation,” Kent Powell, a spokesman for American, said in
an e-mail message.  Some later flights had empty seats, allowing American to
rebook passengers whose earlier flights were canceled, he said.  Southwest’s schedule at Dallas Love Field, where the
airline is based, was returning to normal,   Whitney Eichinger , a
spokeswoman, said earlier today.  A snowstorm, including thunder, moved through the Dallas-
Fort Worth area earlier today, coating streets and bridges with
a thin layer of ice, sleet and snow, the  National Weather
Service  said. The agency extended a  winter weather advisory 
until noon local time as freezing drizzle continued in the area.  To contact the reporters on this story:
