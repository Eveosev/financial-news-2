Denbury Resources Inc. (DNR) , the Plano,
Texas-based company that uses carbon dioxide to boost output
from mature  oil fields , agreed to buy acreage in  North Dakota 
and  Montana  from ConocoPhillips for $1.05 billion to expand its
presence in the  Rocky Mountains .  Denbury plans to close the deal this quarter using $1.3
billion in cash raised in December from selling assets to  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM) , according to a statement today. By buying more oil
fields, Denbury may be able to defer more than $400 million in
taxes, according to the statement.  Denbury  increased  production in each of 2012’s first three
quarters by using carbon dioxide, known as CO2, to help crude
flow more easily from old fields. In about five years, Denbury
plans to reverse the  ConocoPhillips (COP) ’ fields 7 percent to 9
percent annual decline, Ernesto Alegria, a spokesman for
Denbury, said today in a telephone interview.  “We are now purely focused on what we do best, C02-
enhanced oil recovery,” Denbury Chief Executive Officer Phil Rykhoek said in today’s statement. The company expects the
acquisition will produce 140 million to 180 million barrels of
crude, he said.  The 86,000 acres Denbury is acquiring yielded the
equivalent of about 11,000 barrels of oil a day, offsetting
12,500 barrels of average daily production lost in the Exxon
sale, according to  slides  posted today on the company’s website.  Shares Rise  “It’s a net positive for Denbury shares,” Tim Rezvan, a
New York-based analyst for Sterne Agee & Leach Inc. who rates
them a buy and owns none, said today in a telephone interview.
“They’ve replaced production they sold and reduced tax leakage
from the sales.”  Denbury rose 5.2 percent to $17.76 at the close in  New
York , the most since Aug. 3. ConocoPhillips gained 1 percent to
$59.03.  The sale will add $120 million to fourth-quarter results,
ConocoPhillips, based in Houston, said today in a separate
statement.  ConocoPhillips has announced sales of as much as $12.5
billion of assets in the past year, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The company targeted $8 billion to $10 billion of
divestitures from 2012 to 2013 as it sought to remake itself,
selling assets and spinning off its refining business.  The sale doesn’t include assets in the Bakken formation,
according to ConocoPhillips.  To contact the reporter on this story:
