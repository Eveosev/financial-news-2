China should “gradually” establish
a property taxation system that covers trading and ownership,
Premier  Wen Jiabao  said during a visit to the finance ministry
today.  The comments were published in a  statement  posted on the
central government’s website. In its more than two-year effort
to curb the  property market , the government has raised down-
payment and mortgage requirements, imposed a property tax for
the first time in Shanghai and Chongqing, increased building of
low-cost social housing, and placed home-purchase restrictions
in about 40 cities.  Many Chinese cities are preparing to introduce property tax
trials, the China Securities Journal reported on Nov. 16, citing
unidentified people. The central government hasn’t yet decided
on their scale and timing, it said. Prices climbed in 53 of 70
cities in November from the previous month, compared with 35 in
October, according to data from the National Bureau of
Statistics Dec. 18.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
