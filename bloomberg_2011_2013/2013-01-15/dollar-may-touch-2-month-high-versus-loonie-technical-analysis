The U.S. dollar may climb toward a
two-month high versus its Canadian counterpart after it failed
to breach a key support level, Royal Bank of  Canada  said, citing
trading patterns.  The greenback avoided piercing 98.26 Canadian cents,
according to George Davis, the bank’s Toronto-based chief
technical analyst for fixed income and currency strategy. A
close above 99.37 may “expose a pocket of resistance defined
by” C$1.0040 and the highs seen in November and August, Davis
wrote in a report yesterday.  The U.S. dollar bought 98.38 Canadian cents as of 9:40 a.m.
in  Tokyo , little changed from its 98.37 close in New York.
Canada’s currency is known as the loonie, named for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin.  C$1.0040 is the 50 percent Fibonacci retracement level of
its decline from C$1.0447 on June 4 to 96.33 cents on Sept. 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was last seen on
Nov. 16, when the greenback climbed to that month’s peak at
C$1.0057. Its August high was C$1.0085, reached on Aug. 2.  Fibonacci analysis is based on the theory that prices rise
or fall by certain percentages after reaching a high or low. A
break below support, or levels where there may be orders to buy,
indicates it may decline to the next level. A breach of
resistance, where sell orders may be clustered, signals an
advance.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
