Egypt ’s pound weakened for the eight
day this month after banks bought almost all the dollars the
central bank offered at today’s foreign-currency auction.  The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 6.5827 a dollar as
of 2:29 p.m. in Cairo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The pound has dropped 6 percent to a record low since the
central bank started dollar auctions Dec. 30 in which the amount
each bank can buy is capped.  The regulator said last month the policy seeks to protect
what’s left of foreign reserves after they dropped to a
“critical” level. The central bank sold $74 million at today’s
auction, out of $75 million it had offered, according to an
announcement on Bloomberg.  The cut-off price at today’s sale was 6.55 a dollar. Banks
placing bids at that price received 50.68 percent of their
demand, the data show.  The yield on the government’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due
April 2020 was little changed at 5.52 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
