Splunk Inc. (SPLK) , a maker of software
that helps businesses analyze Internet data, gained amid
speculation that it may be acquired.  The San Francisco-based company’s stock rose 6.9 percent to
$33.46 at the close in New York, its highest price since Oct. 4.  Speculation that the company may be bought by  International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  or  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  has shielded the stock
price against a drop resulting from a lockup that expires today,
said  Brian White , an analyst at Topeka Capital Markets Inc., who
rates the shares a buy.  Splunk raised $331 million in a secondary offering on July
19 after surging more than 70 percent since its initial share
sale in April. As part of the secondary offer, selling
stockholders agreed to a lockup that extended the IPO lockup
period on half of their shares until today.  Founded in 2004 by Erik Swan, Rob Das and Michael Baum,
Splunk is the first of the so-called big data companies to go
public. Its software helps businesses monitor and analyze Web
information to improve service, cut operating costs and reduce
security risks. Its backers include venture firms August
Capital, JK&B Capital, Ignition Partners and Sevin Rosen Funds.  Splunk announced today in a statement that one customer,
Ceryx Inc., achieved more than a 200 percent return on its
purchase of Splunk software, reducing “the effort for message-
tracking workflows eightfold.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
