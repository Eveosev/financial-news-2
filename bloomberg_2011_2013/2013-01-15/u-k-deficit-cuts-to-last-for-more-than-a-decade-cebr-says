Britain’s austerity program may last
for more than a decade amid weak economic growth and higher-
than-planned public spending, the Center for Economics and
Business Research said.  Efforts to balance the budget may have to be extended
beyond the 2020 general election, the London-based research
group said in a report published today. Net government debt will
reach 85 percent of economic output by 2017, costing Britain its
top  credit rating , and the deficit by then will be more than
twice as large as government forecasters predict, it said.  “Weak economic growth will hold back the deficit-reduction
program over the coming years,” CEBR economist Scott Corfe said
in an e-mail. “The deficit-reduction program will stretch into
not just the next parliament, but into the one after that.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said last month
austerity will continue until 2018, three years later than
planned when the Conservative-led government took power in 2010
and began tackling a record deficit equal to 11 percent of gross
domestic product.  CEBR said the deficit won’t fall as quickly as Osborne
predicts. By the fiscal year that starts in April 2017, the
shortfall will be 68 billion pounds ($109 billion) instead of
the 31 billion pounds forecast by the  Office for Budget
Responsibility , CEBR said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
