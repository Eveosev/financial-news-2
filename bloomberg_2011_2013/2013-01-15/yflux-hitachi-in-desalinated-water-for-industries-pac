Hyflux Ltd. (HYF) , Singapore’s biggest
publicly traded water company, said it signed an agreement with
 Hitachi Ltd. (6501)  to deliver desalinated seawater to the Indian state
of Gujarat as part of a $600 million project.  The 30-year industrial water purchase agreement is with
Dahej SEZ, the company managing Dahej Special Economic Zone. The
desalination plant construction is a part of the Delhi-Mumbai
Industrial Corridor projects being promoted by the Japanese and
Indian governments, the company said in a statement.  Hyflux also said last week that it will start discussions
with lenders for its S$1.05 billion ($858 million) Tuaspring
venture, the island’s largest desalination plant. Tuaspring is
Singapore’s second seawater desalination facility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
