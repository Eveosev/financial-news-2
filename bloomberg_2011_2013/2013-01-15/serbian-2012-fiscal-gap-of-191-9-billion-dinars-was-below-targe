Serbia ’s fiscal deficit reached
191.9 billion dinars ($2.3 billion) in 2012, less than the
government’s target, even as December’s shortfall was the
second-highest monthly gap of the year.  The gap, calculated according to International Monetary
Fund standards, rose 30.6 billion dinars last month, with
government spending at a record 99.7 billion dinars because of
subsidy payments and aid to pensioners, the Finance Ministry,
based in the capital, Belgrade, said today on its website.  Prime Minister Ivica Dacic’s five-month-old Cabinet had
targeted a gap of 203.6 billion dinars or 6.7 percent of gross
domestic product. The government wants to narrow the deficit to
3.6 percent this year and balance the budget in 2016.  The IMF will examine Serbia’s 2012 budget performance and
the early implementation of fiscal-consolidation measures in
2013 before discussing a new loan deal for the Balkan nation in
the spring, Bogdan Lissovolik, its resident representative, said
today in Belgrade. The government wants a precautionary loan
deal with the Washington-based lender, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
