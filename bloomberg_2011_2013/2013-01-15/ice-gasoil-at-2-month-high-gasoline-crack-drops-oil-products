Gasoil rose to a two-month high on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange, buoyed by forecasts for colder
weather in the region. The product’s crack, or premium to Brent
crude, gained.  Backwardation in ICE gasoil, or the difference between the
first- and second-month contracts, widened to the most since the
end of October. Gasoline’s crack declined for the third session.  Light products  Gasoline barges  in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub
were bid and offered at $970 to $975 a metric ton and haven’t
traded yet, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with
deals from $967 to $973 yesterday.  Gasoline’s  crack , a measure of refining profit, shrank 38
cents to $6.77 a barrel as of 10:36 a.m. local time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in  London . That
compares with $7.14 a barrel the previous session and is the
lowest in more than a week.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent crude, narrowed to
$7.55 a barrel from $8.12 yesterday, PVM data showed. It has
shrunk from $8.73 last week, the biggest discount in more than
five months.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for February delivery rose as much as $12 to $966.50
a ton, the highest intraday level since Oct. 30. It increased
0.8 percent to $962 a ton as of 12:53 p.m. London time on ICE.  The contract’s backwardation, or premium to March futures,
grew to $8 a ton versus $7 the previous session. The market
structure can signal rising near-term demand or falling supply.  The backwardation “is surging with some cold weather on
both sides of the Atlantic,”  Olivier Jakob , managing director
of Switzerland-based researcher Petromatrix GmbH, said in a note
today.  Temperatures in  Frankfurt  are forecast to drop to minus 6
degrees Celsius (21 Fahrenheit) on Jan. 19 from minus 1 today,
according to data from CustomWeather Inc.  Germany  is Europe’s
largest heating oil market. Temperatures will also fall below
zero in London, Paris and Amsterdam this week, the data show.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profit, rose to
$17.54 a barrel versus $17.10 at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent
declined 0.2 percent to $111.61 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
