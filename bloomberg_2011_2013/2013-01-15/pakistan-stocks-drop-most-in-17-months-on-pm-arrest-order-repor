Pakistan’s  benchmark stock index
tumbled the most in 17 months after a report the nation’s top
court ordered the arrest of Prime Minister Raja Parvez Ashraf.  The benchmark  Karachi Stock Exchange 100 Index (KSE100)  sank 3.2
percent to 16,107.89 at the close, its steepest drop since Aug.
9, 2011.  Habib Bank Ltd. (HBL) , Pakistan’s second-biggest by assets,
declined 2.5 percent to 111 rupees. Lafarge Pakistan Cement Co.
sank 7.5 percent to 4.66 rupees.  Lotte Pakistan PTA Ltd. (LOTPTA) , part
of  South Korea ’s Lotte Group, lost 9.2 percent to 6.29 rupees.  “The uncertainty of what may happen is causing investors
to panic,” Rehan Shaikh, chief executive officer at HBL Asset
Management Ltd. in Karachi, said by phone. “Investors are
reacting to the news of the prime minister.”  Pakistan’s Supreme Court today ordered the arrest of Ashraf
on charges of corruption in a case involving rental power
projects, GEO television reported, citing a court order.  The reports of an arrest warrant being issued for Ashraf
came as a popular Islamic cleric, Tahir-ul-Qadri, rallied
thousands of people in the center of Islamabad, vowing to stay
until the government quit and corrupt politicians are removed
from the legislature.  Ashraf took power last year after his predecessor was
removed by top judges for refusing to order the reopening of
graft charges against the president. Rolling power outages in
 Pakistan  have closed factories and sparked street protests.  To contact the reporters on this story:
