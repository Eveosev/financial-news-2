India ’s 10-year bond yield held at
the lowest level since July 2010 as the slowest inflation in
three years added to speculation the central bank will reduce
interest rates this month.  The benchmark wholesale-price  index  rose 7.18 percent in
December from a year earlier, the commerce ministry reported
yesterday, the least since 2009. The median of 34 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 7.37 percent gain. Reserve Bank
of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao, who last lowered the
repurchase  rate  by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April, will
review monetary policy on Jan. 29.  “With wholesale inflation subdued, we believe the RBI is
likely to front-load its policy rate cuts,” analysts at
Standard Chartered Plc, including Mumbai-based Anubhuti Sahay,
wrote in a research note today. “The downward trend in the
inflation trajectory is likely to continue until the third
quarter of 2013.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 was
little changed at 7.80 percent as of 9:50 a.m. in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. It fell seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, yesterday in the biggest
decline since August.  Standard Chartered predicts the RBI will cut its benchmark
rate by 100 basis points in 2013. Investors should buy 10-year
bonds with a yield target of 7.50 percent, the bank recommends.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point to 7.50 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
