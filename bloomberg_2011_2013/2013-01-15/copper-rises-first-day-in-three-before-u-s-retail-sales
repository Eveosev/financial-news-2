Copper fell to the lowest level in
two weeks as mined output of the metal by Rio Tinto Group
increased more than forecast.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange dropped 0.2 percent to $7,984.50 a metric ton at 3:33
p.m.  Shanghai  time, the lowest since Dec. 31. Copper for March
delivery on the Comex in  New York  was little changed at $3.6275
per pound.  Rio Tinto Group, the world’s second largest mining company,
said output of mined copper in the fourth quarter rose 20
percent to 163,900 tons on higher grades at Escondida, the
world’s biggest copper mine. Refined copper production gained 7
percent to 86,200 tons.  “There seems to be ample supplies around,” Xu Liping, an
analyst at HNA Topwin Futures Co., said by phone from Shanghai.
“There is no stockpiling going on here as the metal is easily
available, and demand may be affected more as construction
companies here halt operations in the next couple of weeks
before the Chinese New Year.”  Stockpiles tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed
to 209,096 tons last week, the highest since the week ended
April 20. Markets in  China  will be closed for the week of Feb.
11 for public holidays.  Futures for April delivery on the SHFE fell 1.4 percent to
57,700  yuan  ($9,283) a ton. On the LME, aluminum, zinc, lead and
tin declined, while nickel gained.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
