 Lithuanian inflation under European
Union methodology will probably slow to 2.8 percent from a year
earlier in January compared with 2.9 percent the previous month.  Consumer prices may increase 0.3 percent from December as
post-holiday clothing discounts only partially offset rising
transportation and food costs, the statistics office, based in
the capital, Vilnius, said today on its website.  Lithuania’s 12-month average inflation rate, as measured by
the EU’s harmonized consumer-price index, will probably be 3.1
percent in January, down from 3.2 percent in December, the
office said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
