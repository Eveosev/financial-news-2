Italy  will sell 6 billion euros of
15-year bonds via banks, said a person familiar with the plan.  The debt will be priced to yield 30 basis points more than
Italy’s 4.5 percent March 2026 security, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the details of the transaction
aren’t public yet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
