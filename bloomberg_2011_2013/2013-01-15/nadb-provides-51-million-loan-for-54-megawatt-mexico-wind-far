Cia. Eolica de Tamaulipas SA, a
renewable-energy joint venture that’s partially owned by the
Mexican retailer  Organizacion Soriana SAB (SORIANAB) , received a $51
million loan from the North American Development Bank for a wind
farm to power 163 of its stores.  The financing was denominated in Mexican pesos and
disbursed on Dec. 21, Juan Antonio Flores, a spokesman for the
San Antonio, Texas-based lender, said today in a telephone
interview.  The 54-megawatt wind farm, in the northeastern state of
Tamaulipas, will comprise 30 turbines supplied by  Vestas Wind
Systems A/S (VWS)  and cost $130 million, he said.  Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB (GFNORTEO) , a local lender, will provide
a final tranche of financing for the project by March, Flores
said. Construction is expected to start this quarter.  Cia. Eolica de Tamaulipas’s other owners include the Swiss
investment company Grupo Ecos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
