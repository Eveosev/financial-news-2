Peru ’s sol posted its steepest
decline in two months after the central bank stepped up dollar
purchases to soak up supply from companies paying taxes in local
currency.  The sol depreciated 0.2 percent to 2.5424 per  U.S. dollar 
today, the biggest drop since Nov. 16, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank said on its website it bought $300 million
in the spot market today after purchasing $350 million
yesterday, the most in five months. Mining companies, which
account for 60 percent of the country’s exports, are probably
buying soles before an annual deadline for income tax payments
in April, spurring the currency to a 16-year high yesterday,
said  Mario Guerrero , an economist at Scotiabank Peru SA.  “It’s unusual to have such a high demand for soles at the
start of the year,” Guerrero said in a telephone interview from
Lima. The central bank is trying to prevent “sharp movements in
the currency.”  The sol touched 2.5375 per dollar yesterday, the strongest
level since October 1996,  data  from Peru’s financial regulator
show.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 3.71 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.07 centimo to 126.91 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
