A real estate developer who
graduated from  Harvard Business School  was accused of defrauding
mortgage lenders in a  Brooklyn , New York, property scheme.  Schelton Assoumou, owner of Brooklyn Renaissance
Development Inc., is charged with bank and wire fraud, according
to documents unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn.  Prosecutors allege that Assoumou, a 2005 Harvard Business
School graduate, engaged in the scheme from June 2008 to June
2012. The defendant asked graduates of the school and others to
invest in Brooklyn properties and prepared fraudulent loan
documents for the transactions, according to the criminal
complaint unsealed today.  Assoumou told investors that he would manage the
properties, recruit tenants and make mortgage payments on their
behalf, according to the complaint. Assoumou made only a few
payments and the properties quickly fell into default, the
government said.  “The investigation to date has revealed no evidence that
the defendant made anything other than token efforts to manage
the properties and recruit financially viable tenants,”
prosecutors said in the complaint.  Loans at issue for three Brooklyn properties totaled more
than $2.1 million, according to the complaint. A lawyer for
Assoumou couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  The case is U.S. v. Assoumou, 1:13-mj-00022, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of  New York  (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
