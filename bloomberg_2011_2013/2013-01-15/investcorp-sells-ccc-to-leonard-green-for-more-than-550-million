Investcorp SA, the Bahrain-based
investment firm, said it completed the sale of CCC Information
Services Inc., a provider of software for auto-insurance claims,
to private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP.  The sale of CCC to Los Angeles-based Leonard Green
“unlocks” more than $550 million in proceeds for Investcorp
and its investors and brings to $1 billion the proceeds from
sales since November, the firm said today in an e-mailed
statement. Investcorp bought CCC Information Services for about
$595 million in 2006, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Founded three decades ago, Investcorp, which has
investments in Gucci and  Saks Fifth Avenue , has about $11.5
billion in assets under management, according to its  website .
