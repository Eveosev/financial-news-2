ELO Sistemas Eletronicos SA, a
Brazilian power-meter maker, has deployed 3,400 devices in the
remote Amazonian city of Parintins to help state-controlled
utility  Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA (ELET6)  reduce energy theft.  ELO will install another 12,000 smart meters in the region
this year that will send the utility information about power
failures and line tampering, according to a statement today from
ELO and  Echelon Corp. (ELON) , a San Jose, California-based company
providing some of the components.  Parintins is located on an island in an isolated portion of
the grid and has one of the country’s highest rates of energy
theft because enforcement there is difficult, according to the
statement.  “Parintins will be the first Brazilian city with 100
percent of the customers with a smart meter installed,” Marcos
Rizzo, vice president of business development for ELO, said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
