U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said he was suspending reinvestment of the Government
Securities Investment Fund of the Federal Employees’ Retirement
System, as one of the measures to avoid exceeding the $16.4
trillion debt limit.  “Federal retirees and employees will be unaffected by this
action,” Geithner said today in the letter to congressional
leaders.  Using this measure frees up $156 billion, according to the
Treasury Department, which estimates that all the emergency
measures will run out as early as mid February. After that, the
U.S. may no longer be able to meet its obligations, such as
 Social Security  or Medicare payments, causing “irreparable harm
to the American economy,” Geithner said in a separate letter
yesterday.  This step leaves Treasury with one last extraordinary
measure it can still tap, suspending reinvestment of the
Exchange Stabilization Fund.  President  Barack Obama  warned Republicans in Congress not
to use the debt limit as an opportunity to force new spending
reductions, while many Republicans say a boost in borrowing
authority must be linked to cuts in government expenditures.  To contact the reporters on this story:
