Fiat SpA (F)  plans to roll out the full
range of its 500L compact this year and make at least 110,000
units for markets in  Europe  and the U.S. at its Serbian plant,
the head of the Balkan factory said.  Trekking, an off-road version of the 500L model, and a
right-hand steering wheel for U.K. buyers are expected in the
first half, followed by a U.S. version in the second part of
this year, Antonio Ferrara, the head of Fiat’s Serbian  venture ,
said in an interview in Belgrade yesterday. A longer option that
seats seven or may serve as a pickup, should follow.  “We are going to launch all these versions to keep the
level of attention on the car high,” Ferrara said.  The Serbian plant, Fiat’s newest facility in the world, has
already made almost 30,000 500Ls since production began in July.
The factory’s output should help  Serbia  return to growth in 2013
and boost exports, following an estimated 1.9 percent
contraction in 2012, the country’s second recession in three
years.  The Italian carmaker that controls Chrysler Group LLC
expects a 700 million-euro ($935 million) loss in 2012 in
Europe, where car sales are at almost a two-decade low. Chief
Executive Officer  Sergio Marchionne  said yesterday industry
sales in Europe may recover in the second half of the year.  “The U.K. market is increasing, the German and the Italian
markets are steady, but every 15 days we check the trend and are
totally ready to adjust” volume and versions, Ferrara said.
“We’ve done all the investment necessary to have this
flexibility” at the Kragujevac plant that Fiat formed as a
venture with the Serbian government in 2008.  The factory in central Serbia already plans some overtime
work next month “but we need to be sure demand is
consolidating” before any increase in Fiat Automobili Srbija’s
workforce of 2,500, Ferrara said.  Engines that will be available will range from a 0.9 liter
gasoline model to a 1.6 liter diesel motor, along with those
fueled by natural gas and propane, he said.  FAS  will also start making  Punto  subcompacts again this
year after suspending the model in 2011 when it was preparing
for 500L, Ferrara said. Output is planned at about 1,500 units a
year, “just to meet the local demand” that persists for the
small car that retailed for less than 7,000 euros, he said.  With assistance from Tommaso Ebhardt in Milan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
