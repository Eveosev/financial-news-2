Russian (INDEXCF)  stocks fell for the first
time in three days as the central bank kept rates on hold and
investor appetite for riskier assets declined on concern the
U.S. budget dispute may derail an economic recovery.  The 50-stock Micex Index dropped 0.9 percent to 1,515.25 by
the close in Moscow. Trading volumes were 30 percent higher than
the 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show. OAO
Tatneft, the oil producer based in Russia’s Tatarstan region,
declined 1.4 percent, while OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel fell
2.3 percent.  Concern about the  U.S. economy  increased after Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said government borrowing limits
may be breached as early as next month unless Congress raises
the debt ceiling. Bank Rossii left borrowing costs unchanged,
holding the refinancing rate at 8.25 percent for a fourth month,
the Moscow-based central bank said in a statement on its website
today. The decision was forecast by all 19 economists in a
Bloomberg survey.  “The main issues blocking the  bull market  are the U.S.
delayed fiscal solutions,”  Mark Rubinstein , head of research at
IFC Metropol, said in an e-mailed report today.  Financial markets “could go haywire” if lawmakers don’t
raise the government’s debt limit, President  Barack Obama  said
at a White House news conference yesterday.  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, dropped the most in
two weeks, losing 1 percent to 99.98 rubles. Profit last year
rose 11 percent to 344 billion rubles ($11.4 billion), the bank
said.  Sollers Jumps  OAO Sollers, an automaker, surged 7.9 percent to 774.40
rubles. Russian car and light commercial vehicle sales rose 10.6
percent to 2.94 million in 2012, Association of European
Business committee chairman Joerg Schreiber told reporters in
Moscow today.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, slid 1.1 percent to $29.81. The
RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
stock futures, rose 2.2 percent to 21.09 today.  The Micex trades at about 5.6 times  estimated earnings .
That compares with a multiple of 10.8 times for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index.  Russian equities have the lowest valuations based on
estimated earnings among 21 emerging markets tracked by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
