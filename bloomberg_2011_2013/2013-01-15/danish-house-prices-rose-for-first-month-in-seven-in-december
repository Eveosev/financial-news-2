Danish house prices rose in December
for the first time in seven months and the number of homes for
sale dropped as the nation’s property market shows signs of
recovering.  The Home House  Price Index  rose 1.9 percent last month from
November, the real estate brokerage of  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE) , said in
a press release today. The figures are adjusted for seasonal
swings and based on a three-month rolling average. Prices
slipped 1.9 percent from a year earlier, it said. The number of
homes for sale dropped 2.6 percent last month and sank 12
percent from a year earlier, according to a separate release
published by the  Association Danish Mortgage Banks .  Denmark’s house prices have plunged at least 20 percent
since a 2007 peak, sending the nation into a recession and
sparking a regional banking crisis. The economy, which probably
contracted 0.4 percent last year, will grow 1.2 percent in 2013
as the housing market recovers, the government estimates.  “The stabilization of  house prices  is still fragile,”
Christian Hilligsoe Heinig, chief economist at Danske Bank’s
mortgage unit, Realkredit Danmark, said in a press release.
“It’ll rely on how the domestic economy performs and how much
confidence potential buyers have in the economy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
