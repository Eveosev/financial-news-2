(Corrects date of  Italy  announcement and share gain in
third paragraph.)  Olympic Entertainment Group AS (OEG1T) , the
only publicly traded casino operator in eastern  Europe , fell
from a 52-month high in Tallinn after reporting slower sales
growth for its main Estonian and Latvian units.  The stock fell as much as 7.3 percent, it biggest intraday
drop since February 2010, and closed down 6.3 percent at 1.79
euros in the Estonian capital, valuing the company at 271
million euros ($361 million). Volume of 250,586 shares was more
than twice the three-month daily average.  As of yesterday, Tallinn-based Olympic had gained 36
percent since Aug. 3, when it announced plans to expand to Italy
through an investment in a Milan gaming operator. The company
said today that revenue growth at its Baltic units slowed in the
fourth quarter.  Sales at Olympicâ€™s Estonian and Latvian units rose 8.1
percent and 1.9 percent from a year earlier, respectively,
compared with growth of 14.7 percent and 17.1 percent in January
to September, the company said. Revenue growth at the smaller
Lithuanian unit accelerated to 4.8 percent from the same period
a year ago in October to December, compared with 4.3 percent in
the first nine months of 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
