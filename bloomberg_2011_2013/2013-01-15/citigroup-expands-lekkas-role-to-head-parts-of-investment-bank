Citigroup Inc. (C)  named Linos Lekkas as
head of investment banking for Central Europe,  Middle East  and
Africa as the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets reorganizes
staff amid job cuts.  It’s consistent with “our objective to deploy our human
and financial capital more efficiently,” James Bardrick and
Manuel Falco, co-heads of banking for Europe, the Middle East
and Africa said in a memorandum to employees today. The contents
of the document were confirmed by Edwina Frawley-Gangahar, a
spokeswoman at Citigroup in London.  Chief Executive Officer  Michael Corbat , 52, said in
December that Citigroup will cut about 11,000 jobs, while also
shutting branches and pulling back from some emerging markets as
revenue dries up at global banks. The New York-based firm
earlier this month overhauled management of regional operations
outside the U.S., naming Jim Cowles CEO of Europe, the Middle
East and Africa.  Lekkas, 38, joined Citigroup in January 2011. He will
continue to be head of corporate investment banking for
countries including Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary and Poland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
