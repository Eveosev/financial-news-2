The lira headed for the lowest level
in six days on concern a slowing of new debt purchases by the
U.S. Federal Reserve will cut investors’ appetite for emerging-
market bonds, reducing demand for the local currency.  The lira depreciated 0.1 percent against the dollar to
1.7718, its lowest level on a closing basis since Jan. 9. Yields
on two-year benchmark notes rose as much as 5 basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, and traded one basis point higher at 6.03
percent at 4:41 p.m. in Istanbul.  The Turkish currency appreciated 6 percent last year in the
third-biggest gain in emerging  Europe  after the Polish zloty and
the Hungarian forint as benchmark yields plunged 483 basis
points. Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated yesterday he will
closely scrutinize the potential costs of asset purchases aimed
at spurring economic growth as the Fed’s balance sheet
approaches $3 trillion. Foreign investors were net buyers of $16
billion in Turkish bonds last year.  “Foreigners are staying away from the Turkish market
because of the Fed reports,” Sercan Kiliclar, a fixed-income
trader at  Akbank TAS (AKBNK) , said in e-mailed comments. “The anxiety
is caused by the possibility of Fed halting asset purchases.”  Two-year cross-currency swaps, used by foreign investors to
hedge against currency risk, rose 5 basis points this week to
5.29 percent, the highest level since Nov. 14.  Benchmark notes erased earlier losses after the Treasury
sold 895.7 million liras ($506 million) of 15-month bonds at 6.2
percent, auctioning this maturity for the first time.  The Treasury has completed this month’s sales, raising 12
billion liras of debt in five auctions versus its monthly
domestic borrowing target of 11.6 billion liras. It plans to
auction 34.6 billion liras of debt this quarter, up 89 percent
from the last three months of 2012.  Even as U.S. policy makers were preparing to start new
Treasury purchases, several members of the Federal Open Market
Committee said it would “probably be appropriate to slow or
stop buying well before the end of 2013,” minutes from the
Fed’s Dec. 11-12 meeting showed on Jan. 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
