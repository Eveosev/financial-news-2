The British Bankers’ Association, a
financial lobby group, proposed creating an independent council
to promote a new code of conduct for bankers after scandals
eroded trust in the industry.  The code would guide banks on pay, what’s expected of
boards and controls to prevent unethical behavior, the London-
based BBA said in a submission to parliament  published  today.  The plan comes after banks set aside about 11 billion
pounds ($17.7 billion) to compensate customers mis-sold loan
insurance and the Libor scandal.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc , Britain’s biggest government-owned lender, may pay as much
as 500 million pounds in fines next week to settle allegations
traders tried to rig interest rates, two people with knowledge
of the matter said.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  was fined 290 million pounds in
June for manipulating Libor.  The proposed Banking Standards Review Council “would need
to be independent of the industry” with a non-banking chairman
and a majority of non-banking members, including customers, the
lobby group said in its submission to the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards.  The new Financial Conduct Authority regulator could also
help develop a blacklist of employees to prevent certain
individuals from working in banking or financial services, the
BBA said.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Stephen Taylor  To contact the reporter on this story:
