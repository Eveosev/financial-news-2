A man was struck and killed by a New
York City subway train while another was injured in two separate
rush-hour incidents at one station that snarled train service on
 Manhattan ’s East Side for hours.  A 31-year-old man was killed at about 4:30 p.m. yesterday
at the station at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue when he lost
his balance while defecating between cars on the uptown 6 train
and fell to the tracks, said  Paul Browne , a spokesman for the
 New York City Police Department , in a telephone interview.  About 20 minutes earlier, at the same station, a 50-year-
old homeless, intoxicated man was taken to Harlem Hospital
Center for treatment of gashes to his buttocks and leg and a
broken pelvis, Browne said. Witnesses saw the man climbing out
of the trackbed, yet nobody saw a train hit the man, and he had
no memory of being on the tracks, Browne said.  While there had been reports from some witnesses of an
altercation on the platform, police could find no connection
between the two incidents, Browne said. Service on the 4, 5 and
6 trains was delayed about two hours while police investigated.  New York  City’s subway system is the busiest in the U.S.,
with about 5.7 million daily riders, according to the state’s
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority , which runs the network.
Two people were pushed to their deaths in front of subway trains
in the city last month, and a man and a woman were indicted
separately for their murders this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
