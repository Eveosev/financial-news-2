Corn prices will stay high as a
record crop in Argentina and a higher harvest in  Brazil  will
fail to replenish stockpiles after production losses from the
worst U.S. drought since the 1930s, the  United Nations  said.  “It is too early to talk about a full recovery in
production,  stocks  and a decline in international prices,” said
Liliana Balbi, a senior economist at the UN’s Food & Agriculture
Organization. It will take a recovery in output in the U.S., the
largest grower and exporter, and bumper crops in  China  and
 Europe  to ease the supply concerns, she said.  Global inventories will drop 12 percent to a six-year low
of 116 million metric tons before the 2013 Northern Hemisphere
harvest, as the drought cut U.S.  output  by the most since 1996,
the Department of Agriculture  said  Jan. 11. Higher prices may
curb a decline in  food costs  tracked by the UN. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. reiterated yesterday its forecast that corn will rise
to $8.25 a bushel in three months, saying better U.S. weather is
needed for a recovery in the next crop.  Argentina ’s harvest will jump to a record 25.5 million tons
in the year beginning March 1, from 21 million tons a year
earlier and an earlier estimate of 24 million tons, said Balbi,
who leads an FAO team that issues global warnings on potential
disruption to food supplies. The FAO estimate was raised as
improving conditions boosted yields, she said in an e-mail to
Bloomberg yesterday before releasing a country report.  Record Prices  Corn for delivery in March was little changed at $7.2475 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 5:05 p.m. Singapore time.
While futures have declined 15 percent from a record $8.49 in
August, they are still up 21 percent in the past year.  The drop from record prices spurred higher feed use in
livestock and poultry, draining the U.S. stockpiles to 8.03
billion bushels (204 million tons) as of Dec. 1, the  smallest 
post-harvest supply in nine years, according to USDA data. World
reserves will be 13 percent of consumption in food, sweetener,
ethanol and feeds, the lowest  ratio  since 1974, USDA data show.  “Old-crop stocks could still tighten further, without
higher prices,” Morgan Stanley analysts led by  Hussein Allidina 
wrote in a report Jan. 11.  The USDA estimates Argentina will produce 28 million tons.
Brazil, set to overtake Argentina as the second-largest shipper,
will harvest 71 million tons, 1 million tons more than expected
in December, the Washington-based agency said Jan. 11. The U.S.
collected 273.8 million tons of corn in 2012, down 13 percent
from a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
