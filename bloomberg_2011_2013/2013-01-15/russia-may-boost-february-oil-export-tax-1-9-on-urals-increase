Russia , the world’s biggest energy
exporter, will probably increase  duties  on most oil shipments
abroad by 1.9 percent from Feb. 1 after Urals crude prices rose.  The standard export duty is set to increase to $403.30 a
metric ton, or about $55.02 a barrel, from $395.60 a ton this
month, according to Bloomberg calculations based on oil price
data from the Finance Ministry.  The government is reviewing the export duty structure and
may propose changes by the end of the first quarter to stimulate
output and help producers meet President Vladimir Putin’s goal
of more than 10 million barrels a day. Production remained at a
post-Soviet high of 10.49 million barrels a day for a second
month, according to preliminary December data from the Energy
Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. Oil and gas provide about half of
Russia’s budget revenue.  The discounted rate on some eastern Siberian and Caspian
Sea grades may grow to $198.50 a ton from $192.70 this month.
The levy on extra-heavy crude, set at 10 percent of the standard
duty, would be $40.30 in February.  Russia bases the export taxes on the average Urals blend
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
The benchmark export grade averaged about $110.43 a barrel
during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance
Ministry adviser, said today by phone. In the previous
monitoring period, it averaged $108.66, according to the
ministry.  Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev must sign off on the levies
before they take effect.  The duty for middle distillates, such as diesel, and heavy
products, such as fuel oil, may increase to $266.20 a ton from
$261.10. A gasoline tax, set at 90 percent of the crude oil duty
since May 2011 to counter domestic shortages, may grow to $363 a
ton in February from $356 this month.  The government may raise the duty on liquefied petroleum
gases such as butane and propane to $200.30 a ton from $198.70.  To contact the reporter on this story:
