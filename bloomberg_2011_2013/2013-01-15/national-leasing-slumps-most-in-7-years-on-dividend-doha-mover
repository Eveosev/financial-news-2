National Leasing (NLCS)  tumbled the most in
almost seven years after the Qatari investment company cut its
full-year dividend by 43 percent as net income fell.  The shares slumped 10 percent, the most since March 2006,
to 40.7 riyals at the close in Doha. National Leasing was the
biggest decliner on a percentage basis on the benchmark QE
Index, which decreased 1 percent to 8,557.96, the lowest level
in almost two weeks. About 1.2 million National Leasing shares
were traded today, more than 11 times the three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  National Leasing said today its board recommended a 2012
dividend of two riyals, down from 3.5 riyals for 2011 and 3
riyals for 2010. Full-year profit at the company which invests
in, sells and rents transferable and fixed assets decreased 12
percent to 190 million riyals ($52 million).  Investors were “disappointed as they expected a four-riyal
dividend,” said Samer Darwiche, Dubai-based analyst at Gulfmena
Investments Ltd.  National Leasing trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 9.7
times, compared with 1.1 times for  United Development Co. (UDCD) , which
invests in Qatari infrastructure. The stock is the third-
smallest on the QE Index of 20 companies, with an index
weighting of 1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
