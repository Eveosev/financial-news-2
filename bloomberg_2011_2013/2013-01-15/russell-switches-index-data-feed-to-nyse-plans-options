Distribution of Russell Investmentsâ€™
real-time data feed for its indexes, which serve as benchmarks
for $3.9 trillion in investments, will switch to  NYSE Euronext (NYX) 
as the two firms plan to create new options on the gauges.  NYSE Euronext will be the primary source of intraday data
on measures such as the Russell 2000 Index through a service
called RussellTick, according to a statement from both companies
today. Russell previously distributed the data through Nasdaq
OMX Group Inc. The Russell-NYSE Euronext deal also involves a
commitment to develop new services and products, such as index-
based options, the statement said.  Exclusive rights to trade Russell stock-index futures are
held by  IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) , the energy and commodity
futures bourse that last month agreed to acquire NYSE Euronext
in a $8.2 billion deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
