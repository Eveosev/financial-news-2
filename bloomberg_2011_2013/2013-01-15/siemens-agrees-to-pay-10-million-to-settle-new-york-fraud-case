A  Siemens AG (SIE)  unit agreed to pay $10
million to settle allegations made by  New York  prosecutors that
the company lied about its qualifications to win more than $200
million in infrastructure contracts.  Schlesinger-Siemens Electrical violated New York state law
by filing false documents with two city departments, the New
York District Attorney’s Office said in a statement on its
website yesterday. Siemens takes responsibility for misconduct
committed by its former business partner Schlesinger Electrical
Contractors Inc.,  Munich, Germany-based Siemens said in an e-
mailed statement.  The business “unfairly put itself ahead of more qualified
applicants,” New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., said
in the statement. “Although it safely and successfully
completed the majority of the work it was hired to do, there is
no room for dishonesty in business, particularly when taxpayers
are footing the bill.”  New York’s Department of Environmental Protection awarded
five contracts to Schlesinger-Siemens Electrical with a total
value of $234.8 million between Aug. 31, 2005 and Jan. 19, 2007,
the  district attorney  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
