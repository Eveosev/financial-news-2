The  Abu Dhabi  Investment Authority,
one of the worldâ€™s largest sovereign wealth funds, appointed
Gregory Eckersley as global head of its internal equities
department, overseeing portfolios, risk management and the due-
diligence process.  Eckersley joined ADIA from 1770  Capital Partners , a fund he
jointly started in 2011 that focuses on global energy, mining
and commodities, the Abu Dhabi-based sovereign wealth fund said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Eckersley, who was employed at AllianceBernstein LP for 16
years and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford University, will report
to Mohamed Darwish Al Khoori, executive director of the internal
equities department.  ADIA, established in 1976, manages global investments
including equities, fixed income, real estate and private equity
to provide sustained long-term financial returns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
