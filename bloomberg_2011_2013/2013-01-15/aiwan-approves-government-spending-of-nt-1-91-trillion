Taiwan lawmakers reduced central
 government spending  to NT$1.91 trillion ($65.9 billion) from a
proposed NT$1.94 trillion this year as the nation seeks to
reduce its deficit and the economy shows signs of recovery.  Under the approved budget, revenue for 2013 will be NT$1.73
trillion, little changed from the Cabinet’s August proposal, the
island’s statistics bureau said in a statement yesterday. The
government will run a NT$174.3 billion deficit, according to the
statement. The Cabinet in August proposed a budget deficit of
NT$214.4 billion.  Taiwan’s  economy  remains vulnerable to fluctuations in
demand for its goods amid an uneven global recovery. Gross
domestic product grew at a slower pace than previously estimated
in the third quarter even as a recovery in  China  boosted the
island’s industrial output and exports.  “They are gradually trying to reduce spending at a
moderate pace,” Ma Tieying, a Singapore-based economist at DBS
Group Holdings Ltd., said before the statement. “The fiscal
balance will improve gradually in the coming years and the
public debt-to-GDP ratio can stabilize within five years.’  Taiwan said in November it would alter its public-debt
limit to 50 percent of GDP from 48 percent of gross national
product, or GNP.  To contact the reporters on this story:
