Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the investment
bank that agreed in November to be acquired by  Leucadia National
Corp. (LUK) , raised $1 billion after increasing the size of its first
dollar bond sale in about 21 months.  The bank sold $600 million of 5.125 percent, 10-year
securities to yield 332.5 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and $400 million of 6.5 percent, 30-year
bonds at a relative yield of 357.5 basis points, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The offering was originally set at
$750 million, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly.  Jefferies previously sold dollar debt in April 2011,
issuing $800 million of 5.125 percent, seven-year debentures to
yield 220 basis points more than benchmarks, Bloomberg data
show. The bonds traded at 105.8 cents on the dollar to yield 3.9
percent, or a spread of 312 basis points, on Jan. 8, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  Proceeds will be used to pre-fund the bank’s $250 million
of 5.875 percent notes due June 2014, said the person. About
$350 million of proceeds will be used by Jefferies High Yield
Holdings LLC for a required redemption of two series of its
outstanding non-controlling membership interests.  The new bonds are expected to be rated Baa3, the lowest
level of investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service,
