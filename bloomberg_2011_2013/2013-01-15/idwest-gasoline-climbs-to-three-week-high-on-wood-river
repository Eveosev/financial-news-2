Gasoline in the Midwest strengthened
to a three-week high against futures on the outage of a crude
unit at an  Illinois  refinery.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  shut a pipestill for repairs at the 365,000-
barrel-a-day Wood River, Illinois, plant, after an electrical
fire Jan. 12. The unit restarted today, said  Rich Johnson , a
Houston-based spokesman for the company. The refinery is the
second-largest in the Midwest, behind  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting, Indiana,
plant.  Conventional gasoline  in the Midcontinent, or Group 3
region, rose 6.75 cents a gallon against futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  to a discount of 24.25 cents at 4:30 p.m.,
the smallest gap since Dec. 19.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in  Chicago  gained  2.25 cents  against futures to a discount of 24
cents, the smallest gap in a month.  Inventories of motor fuel in the Midwest, known as PADD 2,
rose by 3.13 million barrels to 55.3 million in the week ended
Jan. 4, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
That’s the most since March 2, the data showed.  Crude supplies  in the region, which includes the storage
hub of Cushing,  Oklahoma , added 1.77 million barrels to 115.1
million last week, the highest level in EIA records dating to
1990. The EIA is part of the Energy Department.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Group 3 area was unchanged
at 3.25 cents below heating oil futures. The same fuel rose 1.5
cents to a discount of  12.5 cents  in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
