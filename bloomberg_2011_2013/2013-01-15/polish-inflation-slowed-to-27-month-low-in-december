Polish inflation slowed in December
to below the central bank’s target for the first time in more
than two years, bolstering the case for more interest-rate cuts.  The  inflation  rate fell to 2.4 percent, compared with 2.8
percent in November, the statistical office in Warsaw said
today. That was less than the 2.5 percent median estimate of 33
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Prices rose 0.1 percent from
the previous month.  Poland’s central bank, faced with inflation above its 2.5
percent target since September 2010, was the only one in the
European Union to raise rates last year. Since the May increase,
policy makers have responded to a slowdown in the EU’s largest
eastern economy by reducing the  benchmark  a combined 75 basis
points to 4 percent. Last week, Governor Marek Belka announced
the current round of monetary easing “is drawing to an end.”  “Policy makers are resisting deeper rate cuts because they
still don’t believe in a sustained fall in the inflation rate
below the target,” Marta Petka-Zagajewska, chief economist at
Raiffeisen Bank in Warsaw, said today by phone. “What could
make them believers is the data on December industrial output,
which we forecast may fall 10 percent.”  The average yield on the government’s two-year Treasury
bond dropped as much as five basis points after the data to 3.28
percent and at 2:25 p.m. in Warsaw traded at 3.31 percent. The
zloty was little changed at 4.1190, keeping it 0.1 percent
weaker on the day.  Poland ’s  economy , which expanded 1.4 percent in the third
quarter from a year earlier, will grow 1.5 percent this year,
the least since 2002, the central bank forecasts. It predicts
the inflation rate may decline to below 1.5 percent next year.  The Central Statistics Office in Warsaw is scheduled to
publish industrial output and producer price data for December
on Feb. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
