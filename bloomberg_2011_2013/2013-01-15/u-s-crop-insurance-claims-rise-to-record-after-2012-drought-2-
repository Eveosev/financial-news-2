The worst U.S. drought since the
1930s led to record payouts on crop-insurance claims, with
farmers collecting $11.581 billion as of yesterday for damage in
2012, government data show.  Payments are up 6.8 percent from 2011, when claims reached
the previous record of $10.843 billion, according to a Risk
Management Agency  report  published today on the U.S. Department
of Agriculture website. In 2010, the total was $4.251 billion.  Last year’s Midwest drought sent corn and soybean prices
surging to records as output fell, while dry fields across the
Great Plains left winter-wheat conditions in November at their
worst since at least 1985, when the USDA began collecting the
data.  “Crop insurance payments made a huge difference for many
farmers that suffered drought losses,”  William Edwards , an
agricultural economist at  Iowa State University  in Ames, said in
a telephone interview. “U.S. crop insurance is easy and a
comprehensive marketing tool that protects against yield losses
and price declines. The program works.”  About 282 million acres of crops were insured in 2012, up
6.1 percent from a year earlier. Farmers planted 326.3 million
acres of 16 principle crops in 2012, the USDA estimates. The
total premium paid for government subsidized crops was $11.06
billion in 2012 compared with $11.97 billion a year earlier.  “Any good insurance program requires high participation to
balance payments with premiums paid,” Edwards said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
