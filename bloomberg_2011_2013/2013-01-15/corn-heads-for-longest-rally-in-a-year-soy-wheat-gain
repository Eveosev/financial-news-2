Corn futures rose, capping for the
longest rally in a year, as dry weather depletes soil moisture
and increases crop stress in  South America , boosting demand for
shrinking U.S. supplies. Wheat also advanced, and soybeans fell.  Parts of  Argentina , Paraguay and southern  Brazil  will have
dry conditions in the next 10 days, Mike Tannura, the president
of T-Storm Weather LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. Rain will be needed by late January to prevent crop
damage after parts of Brazil and Argentina got less than 60
percent of normal rain since Dec. 1, he said.  “South American weather is less than ideal for big
crops,”  Jerry Gidel , the chief feed-grain analyst at Rice Dairy
LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “If it’s still
dry at the start of February, there could be some real yield
losses.”  Corn futures for March delivery rose 0.9 percent to close
at $7.305 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price climbed for the seventh straight session, the longest
rally since Dec. 28, 2011. Earlier, the grain reached $7.345,
the highest for a most-active contract since Dec. 17.  Inventories of  corn  as of Dec. 1 fell to the lowest in nine
years for that date, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on
Jan. 11. The grain surged to a record $8.49 on Aug. 10 after the
worst drought since the 1930s reduced Midwest production.  Wheat futures for March delivery jumped 2.1 percent to
$7.8275 a bushel in  Chicago . The price rose for the third
straight session, the longest rally since Nov. 28, as drought
and cold threatened U.S. winter plants.  Temperatures may fall as low as minus 10 Fahrenheit (minus
23 Celsius) as far south as Kansas and Illinois, increasing risk
for damage to crops without a blanket of snow protection,
Tannura of T-Storm Weather said. The U.S. Drought Monitor showed
severe to exceptional  drought  conditions on 86 percent of the
six-state Great Plains region as of Jan. 8.  Soybean futures for March delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$14.135 a bushel. Earlier, the oilseed reached $14.3625, the
highest since Dec. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
