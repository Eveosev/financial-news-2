U.S. stocks erased losses as a
rally in retailers helped the market recover from an early drop
triggered by concern lawmakers will fail to lift the debt
ceiling.  The Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 Index was little changed at
1,470.25 at 12:35 p.m. in New York after slipping as much as 0.5
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  was up 3.58
points at 13,510.9, reversing a 62 point drop.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
