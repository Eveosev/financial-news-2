     Jan. 15 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  shares  rose, with the
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average closing at a 32-month high, after  Bank
of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said the central bank will
pursue powerful monetary easing.  Sony Corp. (6758) , the nation’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, rose 1.2 percent.  Olympus Corp. (7733)  led gains on the
Nikkei 225 after the optics maker’s shares were recommended by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  Sharp Corp. (6753)  slid 2.7 percent on a
Nikkei newspaper report it cut production of displays for Apple
Inc.’s iPhone on weaker-than expected demand for the handset.  The Nikkei 225 gained 0.7 percent to close at 10,879.08 in
 Tokyo , the highest since April 30, 2010. The broader  Topix (TPX)  Index
advanced 0.8 percent to 906.22 with about two stocks advancing
for each that fell.  Japan ’s markets opened after a three-day
weekend during which Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for a
“bold policy leader” to replace the BOJ’s Shirakawa.  “Abe’s remarks have affected the market, which likes the
fact the government is pushing for monetary and fiscal measures
simultaneously,” said Shintaro Takeuchi, portfolio investment
group manager at Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co. that
manages 8.67 trillion yen ($97 billion) in assets. “It’s up to
fundamentals whether the market will extend gains from here.”  The Topix capped its longest weekly winning streak since
1989 on Jan. 11, when the Cabinet approved a 10.3 trillion yen
stimulus package. Goldman, Bank of America Corp. and Nomura
Holdings Inc. are expecting Japanese stocks to extend gains as
added economic stimulus boosts earnings. The gauge is trading at
1.08 times book value, compared with 2.20 for the  Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  and 1.59 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Shirakawa Comments  Shirakawa, whose term ends in April, said the BOJ will
provide powerful monetary easing and monitor the impact of
currencies on prices and the Japanese economy. He spoke at a
meeting of BOJ branch managers in Tokyo today.  At its meeting on Jan. 21-22, the BOJ will double its
inflation target to 2 percent, a move advocated by Abe,
according to people familiar with officials’ discussions. The
yen reached 89.67 against the dollar yesterday, the weakest
since June 2010, and 110 to the euro. A lower yen enhances the
value of overseas earnings at Japanese exporters.  Shares pared gains as the yen strengthened after Economy
Minister Akira Amari said Japan faces risks from any excessive
decline in the currency, highlighting limits on Abe’s campaign
to drive down the currency. The yen rose against all of its 16
major counterparts, dimming the outlook for Japanese exporters.  “The market has yet to have a sense about where the yen is
likely to settle, and so market participants are looking for
whatever clues available,” said Koichi Kurose, chief economist
in Tokyo at Resona Bank Ltd., which oversees about 15 trillion
yen.  Exporters Advance  Sony gained 1.2 percent to 995 yen, paring a gain of as
much as 2.5 percent.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a carmaker that gets 79
percent of its revenue outside Japan, added 1.2 percent to 883
yen after advancing as much as 2.2 percent.  Futures on the S&P 500 Index slid 0.2 percent today. The
gauge yesterday fell 0.1 percent as Apple’s slump to an 11-month
low amid concern about iPhone sales offset a rally in Dell Inc.
shares.  Olympus advanced 7.7 percent to 1,937 yen after Goldman
raised its rating to buy from neutral amid rising
interchangeable lens camera sales.  Sharp paced declines by Apple suppliers after the Nikkei
newswire said orders for iPhone 5 parts had been cut about 50
percent following lower-than-expected sales. Sharp, which makes
displays for the smartphone, dropped 2.7 percent to 321 yen.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  added 4.7 percent
to 21.97, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.3 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
