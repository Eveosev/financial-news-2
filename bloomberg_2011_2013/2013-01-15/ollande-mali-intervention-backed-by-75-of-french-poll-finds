French President  Francois Hollande ’s
decision to send troops to  Mali  was backed by 75 percent of
people questioned in France, according to a BVA poll.  The support reflected the “virtually unanimous” backing
of the nation’s political leaders for the move, according to a
statement by Eric Bonnet, polling director at the Paris-based
firm. In contrast, almost two-thirds of those questioned in
March 2011 opposed the action in  Libya .  Among backers of Hollande’s Socialist Party, support for
the Jan. 11 military intervention was 74 percent. It reached 60
percent among adherents of the anti-immigrant National Front,
the poll found.  Support for the intervention in Mali could drop
precipitously if the conflict dragged on, Bonnet said. The
survey questioned 1,252 people and was conducted yesterday and
today by telephone and Internet by BVA for Le Parisien. It has a
margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
