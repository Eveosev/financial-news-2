BOC Aviation, an aircraft lessor
owned by  Bank of China Ltd. (3988) , said it will buy 50 Airbus SAS A320
family planes, as rising travel in the region spurs demand for
new aircraft.  The order comprises of A320 and A321 variants, including 25
neos, BOC Aviation said in a statement today. The order is worth
more than $4 billion at 2012 list prices on Airbus website.
Planemakers usually give discounts to large customers.  The planes are scheduled for delivery from the second half
of 2014 through end of 2019, the lessor said.  PT Garuda
Indonesia (GIAA) ’s low-cost unit also announced yesterday an order for
25 Airbus A320neos, as carriers expand their fleet to benefit
from rising travel in  Asia .  BOC Aviation previously placed an order for the A320 jets
in 2010, it said. With the current agreement, the company’s
cumulative orders for Airbus planes reached 187, it said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
