Portugal ’s  economy  will contract
more than previously forecast this year as export growth slows,
the country’s central bank said.  Gross domestic product will shrink 1.9 percent in 2013
after declining an estimated 3 percent in 2012, the Lisbon-based
Bank of Portugal said today in its winter economic bulletin. In
November, the bank forecast a contraction of 1.6 percent for
2013. It projects growth of 1.3% in 2014.  “The outlook for the Portuguese economy in 2013 and 2014
continues to be marked by the process of adjustment of the
structural macroeconomic imbalances, including the short-run
impact of fiscal consolidation measures, as well as tight
financing conditions,” the central bank said in a statement.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling rising
joblessness and a deepening recession as he cuts spending and
raises taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-euro ($104
billion) aid plan from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund. Portugal has already been given more time to
narrow its budget shortfall after  tax revenue  missed forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
