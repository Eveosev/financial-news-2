Innovation has become the holy grail. Finding innovation is almost a sacred quest for the solution that will create growth, and open new eras of prosperity and well-being. 
Unfortunately, like many things called holy, the concept of innovation is invoked ritually and ceremonially more than it is embraced in practice.  For all the talk about innovation, I see many leaders in numerous organizations in every sector who actively stifle it. They say they want more innovation. But at the same time, they seem to operate by a set of hidden principles designed to prevent innovations from surfacing or succeeding. I've compiled them into a set of anti-rules. Acting in these nine ways guarantees that there will be little or no innovation of any significance, because no one had the time, money, or motivation to innovate: Following these rules ensures that innovation will wither on the vine, if it even surfaces in the first place. That is often just fine with established interests, who would rather be protected against the nuisance of change. It's not so fine for success in a highly dynamic environment that demands new solutions. Leaders who want to nurture innovation can reverse the anti-innovation rules and eliminate the practices that stifle innovation, in order to create a pro-innovation culture. For each of these innovation-stiflers, innovation-promoters can move to the opposite behaviors. In a culture of innovation, these actions allow innovation to flourish: Leaders seeking innovation should adhere to these pro-innovation principles. But it might also be a good idea to keep the innovation-stiflers posted as a reminder of what  not  to do.
