Morocco is seeking to award work on
the second phase of its Ouarzazate solar power project by the
end of the year, the nation’s minister of mines and energy said.  Fouad Douiri, speaking at a conference in  Abu Dhabi , said
the project would provide 300 megawatts to 340 megawatts of
power once completed. The first phase of the project is being
built by ACWA Power International, a Saudi Arabia developer.  The project is part of the nation’s ambition to generate 2
gigawatts of electricity from solar power by 2020, requiring
investment of as much as $9 billion. Next year, he said the
government plans to tender for another solar project in the city
of Oujda about 60 kilometers south of the  Mediterranean Sea . It
would be between 400 megawatts and 500 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
