Platinum surged to a three-month
high, exceeding the price of gold for the first time since
April, after the world’s largest producer said it will cut
production. Palladium reached a 10-month high and gold rose.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  said today it will idle four
shafts in  South Africa , cutting output by 400,000 ounces a year,
after a review of its operations. The reduction is equal to
almost 7 percent of total global production. The metal is mainly
used in pollution-control devices in cars and in jewelry, and
Barclays Plc estimated last month that supply will fall short of
demand by 38,000 ounces this year.  “There is a rush to buy platinum as today’s news means
that the market will be pushed further into deficit,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist at Archer Financial
Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “We
are seeing strength in other precious metals as well.”  Platinum futures for April delivery climbed 1.9 percent to
settle at $1,689.90 an ounce at 1:15 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  after touching $1,706.80, the highest for a
most-active contract since Oct. 9. The precious metal has gained
9.6 percent this month, compared with last year’s 9.8 percent
advance.  An ounce of gold bought as little as 0.99 ounce of platinum
in London earlier today, compared with about 1.16 ounces in
August,  data  compiled by Bloomberg show.  Palladium futures for March delivery added 1.4 percent to
$713.35 on the Nymex, after reaching $725, the highest since
Feb. 29.  Gold Advanced  Gold advanced for a second day after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday that while the  U.S.
economy  is responding to monetary stimulus there is still
“quite a ways to go.”  “The market is reading this as a sign that the easing will
continue for some time,” Klopfenstein of Archer Financial said.  Gold futures for February delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$1,683.90 an ounce on the Comex in  New York . Yesterday, prices
climbed 0.5 percent.  Silver futures for March delivery increased 1.3 percent to
$31.529 an ounce on the Comex.  To contact the reporters on this story:
