Brazil’s retail sales expanded for a
sixth straight month in November as President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
administration keeps in place tax cuts implemented to spur
demand.  The volume of sales rose 0.3 percent, after increasing 0.8
percent in October, the national statistics agency said today in
Rio de Janeiro. The median estimate of 30 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for sales to gain 0.2 percent. From the year
earlier, sales increased 8.4 percent, in line with the 8.3
percent forecast of 32 economists surveyed.  President Dilma Rousseff’s government has granted tax
breaks for goods including furniture, appliances and automobiles
to prop up demand and spur faltering growth in the world’s
second-largest emerging market economy. It also pressured banks
to lower borrowing costs to increase lending, while the central
bank cut its  benchmark   interest rate  more than any other Group
of 20 nation to a record 7.25 percent.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo , rose 2 basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 7.71 percent at 9:10 a.m. local time. The
real weakened 0.09 percent to 2.0335 per dollar.  Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  announced on Dec. 19 that
retailers, excluding supermarkets, will be exempt from payroll
taxes starting in April. He also announced the extension of IPI
tax cuts on some  consumer goods  through June, though at lower
levels.  Brazil’s central bank estimates the economy grew 1 percent
last year, its worst performance since 2009, while economists
surveyed by the bank forecast 3.2 percent growth this year. The
economy grew 2.7 percent in 2011 and 7.5 percent in 2010.  The broader retail index, which includes the sale of cars
and construction materials, rose 7.2 percent from the previous
year, the statistics agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
