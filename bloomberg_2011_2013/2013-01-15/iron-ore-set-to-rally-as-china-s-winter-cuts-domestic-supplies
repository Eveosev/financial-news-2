Iron ore, trading near a 15-month
high, may extend the rally in the first half as steelmakers in
China, the biggest buyer, seek imports to make up for losses in
domestic production because of the coldest winter in 28 years.  Prices may average $130 a ton this quarter before climbing
to $135 in the next three-month period,  Tom Price , a commodities
analyst at UBS AG, said today. The country’s mines have been
unable to boost output that was curbed by the cold spell, Credit
Suisse Group AG said Jan. 10. Prices may rise to $170 a ton in
the first half, Deutsche Bank AG said Jan. 8.  The steelmaking raw material has surged 78 percent since
dropping to a near three-year low in September as demand in
China rebounded on optimism the world’s second-largest economy
is recovering from a seven-quarter slowdown. That offered some
respite to producers such as Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
second-largest mining company, which posted a better-than-
expected fourth-quarter output and said it’s pressing ahead with
expansion of its biggest business.  “It’s the hardest time of the year for them to switch to
domestic supplies,” UBS’ Price said by phone from Sydney.
Production “runs at pretty high rates until about November or
December and then starts to buckle as it starts to snow.”  Iron ore  with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin declined a third day, falling 0.2 percent to
$154.60 a dry ton yesterday, according to data from The Steel
Index Ltd. The ore climbed to $158.50 a ton on Jan. 8, the most
expensive since Oct. 13, 2011. The price averaged $120.58 a ton
in the three months ended Dec. 31, according to The Steel Index.  China Supplies  The rally prompted Chinese steelmakers to use more domestic
supplies, according to Mysteel.com. Domestic ore accounted for
84.1 percent of the fines used to process into pellet feed and
28.2 percent of the ore used to produce sinter feed as of Jan.
11, up from 80.1 percent and 26.2 percent respectively reported
on Dec. 21, the researcher said in a  survey  of 60 smaller mills.
Pellet and sinter feed are both used in blast furnaces to make
iron in steel production.  The advance in prices will stop Chinese steelmakers from
rebuilding inventories, according to Hebei Iron & Steel Group
and Maanshan Iron & Steel Co.  China  boosted imports by 8.4
percent to a record 743.55 million metric tons in 2012,
according to customs data released Jan. 10. Shipments last month
climbed to 70.94 million tons, also an all-time high, from 65.78
million tons in November, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Rio’s share of ore production rose to 52 million tons in
the three months to Dec. 31 from 51.2 million tons a year
earlier, the London-based company said today in a statement.
That compares with the median forecast of 50.6 million tons of
four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Steel reinforcement-bar futures fell 0.7 percent to close
at 3,977 yuan ($640) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. The
average spot price for rebar fell 0.3 percent to 3,739  yuan  a
ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing Antaike.  Iron ore is measured in dry tons, or metric tons less
moisture. At Tianjin port moisture can account for 8 percent to
10 percent of the ore’s weight.  To contact the reporter for this story:
