indicating the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average will retreat from its
highest level in 32 months, on speculation the market is
overbought.  American Depositary Receipts of  Sharp Corp. (6753) ,  Japan ’s
biggest maker of liquid crystal displays that counts Apple Inc.
as a customer, lost 4.6 percent, indicating its shares may
decline for a second day after the Nikkei newswire reported
Apple scaled back orders for iPhone parts. Brother Industries
Ltd. may be active after Credit Suisse Group AG advised selling
shares of the Japanese office equipment manufacturer. ADRs of
Toyota Motor Corp. climbed 0.5 percent as Citigroup Inc.
recommended buying the carmaker’s shares.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in

yesterday, its highest level since April 2010, and has climbed
26 percent since Nov. 14, when elections were called. The yen
has fallen to a more than two-year low amid expectations the

and defeat deflation.  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 14.3 times estimated
earnings, compared with 13.3 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500

according to data compiled by Bloomberg News.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
