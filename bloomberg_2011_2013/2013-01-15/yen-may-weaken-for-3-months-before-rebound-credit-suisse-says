The yen will weaken against the
dollar in the next three months as Japanese government officials
increase economic stimulus, according to  Credit Suisse Group AG. (CSGN)   Japan ’s currency may depreciate to 91 per dollar, compared
with a previous forecast of 84, before strengthening to 80
within 12 months, the Zurich-based bank said in a report.  The yen touched the weakest versus the U.S. dollar since
June 2010 yesterday on bets Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
will select a central-bank chief who will expand monetary
stimulus. The currency rose the most since May versus the dollar
today as Japanese Economy Minister Akira Amari said an
excessively weak currency may hurt imports and households,
damping bets policy makers will try to push it down further.  “Over time, it is increasingly difficult for the Bank of
Japan to deliver on market expectations for an increase in
inflation,”  Daniel Katzive , director of global foreign-exchange
at Credit Suisse in New York, said in a telephone interview.
“We think they will stop short of the real game-changing step
of buying foreign assets.”  The yen rose 1 percent to 88.60 per dollar at 1:26 p.m. New
York time. Japan’s currency is down about 12 percent versus the
greenback since the end of September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
