Spain’s core  inflation  rate fell in
December as price pressures ease in an economy confronting a
second straight year of contraction.  Annual core  inflation , which excludes energy and fresh food
prices, fell to 2.1 percent from 2.3 percent in November, the
National Statistics Institute in Madrid said today. That
compares with an 2.3 percent median forecast of five estimates
in a Bloomberg survey. Underlying prices were unchanged from the
previous month.  The  recession  in the euro region’s fourth-biggest economy
is deepening as Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy struggles to tackle
a budget deficit that matches that of  Greece  as the euro-area’s
second biggest after Ireland. The European Central Bank last
week left its benchmark interest rate unchanged as it sees flat
growth in the region in 2013.  Spain’s headline inflation rate, based on EU calculations,
was 3 percent, matching an estimate published on Jan. 2. Tax
increases are fueling price increases even as a 26.6 percent
jobless rate undermines demand. Retail sales fell 7.8 percent in
November, after 9.7 percent in October.  Stripping out their impact, inflation was 0.9 percent in
December, according to the Spanish statistics institute, and 0.2
percent if fresh food and energy were also excluded, according
to the Spanish measure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
