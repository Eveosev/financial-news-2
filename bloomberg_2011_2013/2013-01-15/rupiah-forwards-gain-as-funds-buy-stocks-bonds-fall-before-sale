Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards advanced
after global funds bought equities on bets economic growth will
accelerate.  Government bonds  fell as the  finance ministry  held
its first debt auction of 2013.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  added to yesterday’s biggest
gain since September after overseas investors bought $48 million
more of local stocks than they sold on Jan. 14, exchange data
show. The government sold 9 trillion rupiah ($926 million) of
notes, exceeding its 7 trillion rupiah target, Robert Pakpahan,
director general at the debt management office, said in a
mobile-phone message.  The rupiah’s one-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.2
percent to 9,9967 per dollar as of 3:36 p.m. in Jakarta, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s 2.5 percent weaker than the
onshore spot rate, which slid 0.8 percent to 9,715, prices from
local banks compiled by Bloomberg show. A daily  fixing  used to
settle non-deliverable forward contracts was set at 9,859 today
by the Association of Banks in  Singapore .  “The forwards reflect foreign investors’ positive
perception of Indonesia,” said Rully Nova, a currency analyst
at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in Jakarta. “The strengthening
today is supported by good sentiment from stocks.”  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, was steady at 6.75
percent, the highest level since September.  Southeast Asia’s largest economy may grow 6.6 percent to
6.8 percent this year, Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said
yesterday, compared with the central bank’s Jan. 10 estimate for
6.3 percent growth in 2012.  The yield on the government’s 9.5 percent notes due June
2015 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.57
percent, according to the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
