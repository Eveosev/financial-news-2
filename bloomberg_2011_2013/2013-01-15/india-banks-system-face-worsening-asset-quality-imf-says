India’s financial system has been
made vulnerable by a deterioration in bank assets and a lack of
capital as the economy slowed, according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  “The main near-term risks to the financial system are a
worsening of bank asset quality and renewed pressures on
systemic liquidity,” the Washington-based lender said in a
statement today. Stress tests have shown the risks are
“manageable” for now, according to the IMF, which concluded
its assessment of India’s financial stability in February 2012.  Increasing involvement of the state in the financial
industry leaves the government exposed to losses at banks and is
acting as a brake on economic growth, the IMF said. India’s
economy will expand 6 percent this year, the body said in
October, after gross domestic product rose 4.9 percent in 2012,
the least since at least 2005.  The IMF urged Indian regulators to loosen a mandatory
requirement for banks to hold government securities, saying that
it would boost the flow of capital to other industries. India
should also foster development of the local corporate  bond
market  to broaden funding sources, according to the statement.  India remains committed to adopting international standards
“in a phased manner and calibrated to local conditions,” the
 Reserve Bank  of India said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
