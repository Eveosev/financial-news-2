Polish bond yields declined and the
zloty weakened for a fourth day after the  inflation rate  fell
below the central bank’s target for the first time in more than
two years, stoking speculation of more interest-rate cuts.  The yield on two-year notes fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 3.39 percent at 3:40 p.m. in Warsaw. The
zloty depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 4.1168 per euro.  The inflation rate dropped to 2.4 percent last month, the
lowest since August 2010 and below the central bank’s 2.5
percent target, the statistics office said today. While policy
makers cut borrowing costs for third time in as many months last
week in a bid to spur  Poland ’s slowing economy, Governor  Marek Belka  said the current “round” of monetary easing was coming
to an end.  “The significant fall in inflation to below the target in
December supports the dovish Monetary Policy Council members,”
said  Maja Goettig , chief economist for central and eastern
 Europe  at KBC Securities NV in Warsaw. “The odds of another 25
basis-point cut already in February should increase” if the
inflation data is accompanied by a decline in December
industrial production and weakness in employment, she said.  Polish  industrial output  probably slumped 6.5 percent from
a year earlier last month, according to a median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 28 economists. The statistics office is
scheduled to release the data on Jan. 18.  To contact the reporter on this story:
