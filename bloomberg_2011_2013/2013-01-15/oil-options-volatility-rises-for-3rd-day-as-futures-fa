Crude options volatility rose for a
third day as the underlying futures fell from the highest level
in almost four months.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
March, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 23.89 percent on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  as of 4:40 p.m., compared with 23.76 percent yesterday.  Volatility for February options, which expire tomorrow,
rose to 23.99 percent from 23.86 percent yesterday, after
falling as low as 20.46 percent on Jan. 8. March volatility was
21.98 on that day.  “Volatility is going up but just incrementally,” said
Michael Truscelli, a broker and trader at Paramount Options Inc.
in New York and a Nymex trader. “It was just a little too low
for everybody.”  Oil futures for March delivery fell 87 cents to $93.72 a
barrel on the Nymex. February-delivery crude futures, which
expire Jan. 22, declined 86 cents to $93.28 a barrel.  The most-active options in electronic trading today were

volume of 2,189 contracts at 4:45 p.m. in  New York . March $120

they were unchanged at 4 cents a barrel.  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 60
