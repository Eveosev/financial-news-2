Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s biggest retailer, is pledging to hire more than 100,000 people in the next five years by employing veterans in need of work, the  New York  Times reported.  The  Arkansas , Bentonville-based retailer will employ any veteran who has left the military in the previous year and didn’t have a dishonorable discharge, the newspaper reported on its website dated Jan. 14. William Simon, president of the U.S. unit, will announce the plans in a speech to the  National Retail Federation , according to the report.  Wal-Mart is promising to hire more veterans as unemployment in the U.S. has stayed close to 8 percent. The retailer has about about 1.4 million employees in the country, according to a March regulatory  filing .  The plans are among the largest hiring commitments for veterans in history and the program will officially begin on May 27, or Memorial Day, the report said.  Due to the size of Wal-Mart’s retail operations and supply chain, the company is almost sure to find a position, even if part-time, for any veteran looking for work, the article said citing Gary Profit, senior director of military programs at Wal- Mart as saying.
