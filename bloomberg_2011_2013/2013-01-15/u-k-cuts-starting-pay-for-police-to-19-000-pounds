U.K. Home Secretary Theresa May will
cut the annual starting salary for rank-and-file police officers
by 17 percent to 19,000 pounds ($30,500) as the government
reviews officers’ working conditions amid budget cuts.  Accepting most of the recommendations of an independent
review by lawyer Tom Winsor, May said the revamp of police pay
is the first for 30 years in Britain. Policing unions reacted
with anger when his recommendations were published last year.  May said in a  written statement to Parliament  in  London 
today that the decision reflected “the tough economic
conditions and the government’s wider economic objectives, which
include reduction of the deficit and the challenging but
manageable reduction in government funding to the police over
the spending review period.”  Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said last month
the government’s austerity program will continue until 2018,
three years later than planned when the Conservative-led
government took power in 2010 and began tackling a record
deficit equal to 11 percent of gross domestic product.  May said plans to bring in compulsory severance across all
ranks within the police will be held back for further
negotiation.  Steve Williams, the chairman of the Police Federation of
England and  Wales , which represents rank-and-file officers, said
in a statement that the group accepted the findings of the
independent process, though it remains “disappointed with some
of the recommendations.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
