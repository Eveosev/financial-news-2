Tas Viglatzis was named chief
financial officer at the FT Group, the Pearson Plc-owned
division that manages the Financial Times newspaper.  Viglatzis will help the company meet financial objectives
and identify acquisitions, as well as build new revenue streams
and boost efficiency, the FT Group said in a statement today.
Viglatzis was previously director of strategy at the FT.  The FT Group is seeking to boost revenue from online
sources and cut its reliance on physical subscriptions as more
readers get their news online or on smartphones and tablets.  The company also appointed Gio Stoppiello as chief
operating officer at the FT Group. Stoppiello previously worked
as the group’s U.K. finance director.  Both appointees take over from Scott Henderson, who is
leaving the company to pursue new opportunities in  North
America .  To contact the reporter on this story:
