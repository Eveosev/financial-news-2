President  Barack Obama  is close to
naming  Denis McDonough  as his fifth chief of staff, with an
announcement coming as soon as this week, according to a person
familiar with the matter.  McDonough, if selected, would succeed Jack Lew, Obama’s
choice as the next Treasury secretary.  Selecting McDonough
would elevate one of the president’s former congressional staff
members whose loyalty to him is unquestioned, according to
people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to
discuss personnel decisions.  The chief of staff serves as the president’s gatekeeper,
making the position one of the most powerful in the White House.
Obama, a senator from  Illinois  when he won the presidency in
2008, has a long relationship with McDonough, 43, who joined his
Capitol Hill office in 2007, said the people.  “Denis has been one of the people the president has most
trusted and depended on,” said Bill Burton, Obama’s former
deputy press secretary. “He is extraordinarily talented,
extremely intelligent and unbelievably loyal in a town where
loyalty is not always rewarded.”  Last week, Obama named Lew as Timothy F. Geithner’s
replacement as Treasury Secretary, leaving a vacancy should the
appointment gain Senate confirmation. The chief of staff job
isn’t subject to Senate confirmation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
