WPP Plc (WPP)  Chief Executive Officer
 Martin Sorrell  said the world’s largest advertising company
recorded stronger-than-expected performance in December, which
boosted results for the fourth quarter.  The company has budgeted for 2 percent to 3 percent growth
in advertising spending by its customers in 2013, while its
operating companies are more optimistic, calling for growth of
as much as 4 percent, Sorrell said today at an event in London.  Sorrell has been pushing into digital marketing and faster-
growing markets, such as Malaysia and  Brazil , as the advertising
industry prepares for a possible slowdown in spending following
the Olympics and U.S. Presidential elections last year.  WPP  rose  as much as 1.6 percent to 960 pence in  London , and
traded 1 percent higher at 954.50 pence as of 12:15 p.m., giving
the company a market value of 12.1 billion pounds ($19.4
billion).  Last month, WPP said it would relocate its base back to
London after four years in Dublin.  Analysts project a 3.6 percent increase in WPP’s 2013
revenue, the average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
