Russian investigators charged Elena Kotova, the country’s former top representative at the  European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development , for seeking a bribe of
$1.4 million.  Kotova demanded the bribe in return for facilitating a $95
million EBRD loan to a Canadian oil and gas company, the
 Interior Ministry  in Moscow said in a  statement  on its website
today. The decision to charge Kotova is “totally unfounded,”
her lawyer, Sergei Mirzoev, said by phone.  The former EBRD official was charged along with a top
manager of a major Russian bank, the ministry said, adding that
he acted as a go-between in the attempted bribe-seeking.  Russia in February 2011 opened a criminal case against
Kotova, who resigned from her post as the Russian representative
at the  development bank  in December 2010. The EBRD, owned by 63
countries and two intergovernmental institutions, was created in
1991 to invest in former communist countries and help them
transform their economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
