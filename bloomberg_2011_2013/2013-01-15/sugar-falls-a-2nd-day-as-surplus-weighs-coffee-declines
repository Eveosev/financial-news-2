Cocoa futures fell for the second
time in three sessions on signs that global demand is ebbing.
Sugar and orange juice also slid, while coffee and cotton
advanced.  European cocoa-bean processing fell 6.2 percent in the
fourth quarter, bringing the 2012 total to a seven-year low,
according to the European Cocoa Association. Grinding in  North
America  fell 4.4 percent on increasing inventories amid a
faltering economy, according to the average of 10 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  “The European grind was very bad, so the attitude will be
bearish either way” for prices,  Jack Scoville , a vice president
for Price Futures Group, said in an e-mail from  Chicago .  Cocoa for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to $2,252 a
metric ton at 11:09 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York . The
price is down 0.7 percent since Jan. 10.  The Washington-based  National Confectioners Association 
will release its North American processing data on Jan. 17.  Also in New York, raw-sugar futures for March delivery
retreated 0.4 percent to 18.82 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for March delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$1.109 a pound on ICE.  Arabica-coffee futures for March delivery climbed 0.8
percent to $1.5465 a pound in New York, after touching $1.565,
the highest for a most-active contract since Nov. 29.  Cotton futures for March delivery gained 0.5 percent to
75.88 cents a pound on ICE.  To contact the reporters on this story:
