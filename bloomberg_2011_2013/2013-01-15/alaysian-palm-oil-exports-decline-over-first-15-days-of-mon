Palm oil shipments from  Malaysia 
tumbled 21 percent in the first 15 days of this month, said
Intertek, adding to signs that a zero-rated tax on exports
intended to clear record stockpiles has yet to boost trade.  Exports declined to 570,510 metric tons from 719,817 tons
in the same period in December, surveyor Intertek said in a
statement. That compares with a 25 percent drop in the first 10
days of this month. A separate estimate of 15-day shipments from
Societe Generale de Surveillance is scheduled later today.  The country, the second-largest producer, set the tariff at
zero this month to drain reserves, and Plantation Industries and
Commodities Minister Bernard Dompok said yesterday the same rate
would extend into February. Palm has tumbled into a  bear market 
in Kuala Lumpur as stockpiles expanded and  Indonesia , the
biggest grower, boosted exports.  “We continue to compete with Indonesia and there’s no good
visibility on whether our zero percent export tax is working or
not,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst at Alliance Investment Bank
Bhd. “It may take some time.”  Exports to  China , the biggest palm oil consumer after
 India , dropped 45 percent to 120,950 tons in the first 15 days
of January from 221,287 tons in the same period last month,
according to Intertek. China’s quality watchdog, the General
Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine, tightened inspections on  imports  of cooking oils
from Jan. 1 to improve  food safety .  Palm oil  for March delivery advanced 1.1 percent to 2,397
ringgit ($796) a ton on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange at
4:37 p.m., paring the loss over the past year to 24 percent.
Today’s advance came after soybeans, which can be crushed to
provide an alternative oil, rallied yesterday.  Stockpiles should start to decline and a level below 2
million tons will be “quite comfortable,” Dompok said
yesterday. Inventories of the oil used in foods and fuels
reached an all-time high of 2.63 million tons in December.  The Malaysian government said in October it would cut the
export tax on palm oil to between 4.5 percent and 8.5 percent,
from 23 percent, effective from Jan. 1. The tariff for this
month was set at zero as the base price was below the threshold
of 2,250 ringgit a ton that triggers the 4.5 percent rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
