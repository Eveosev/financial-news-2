Bonds of  Ameren Corp. (AEE) ’s generating
unit fell to their lowest level after the owner of  Missouri ’s
largest utility said last month it was quitting the so-called
merchant generation business, precipitating a rating cut.  Ameren Energy Generating Co.’s $300 million of 7 percent
bonds due in 2018 plunged 12.75 cents to 65.5 cents on the
dollar to yield 17.3 percent at 9 a.m. in New York, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. That’s the lowest level since the bonds
were sold in June 2008.  Ameren will quit owning power plants that sell electricity
at market rates and is taking a non-cash pretax charge of $1.5
billion to $2 billion in the fourth quarter, the St. Louis-based
company said in a Dec. 20 regulatory filing. Moody’s Investors
Service cut the unit’s senior unsecured rating two levels, to B2
from Ba3, and put the grade under review for a further
reduction, the firm said in a Jan. 10 statement.  The downgrade and continuing review reflects Ameren’s
“weak stand-alone metrics and uncertainty over its
sustainability as a standalone entity,” Toby Shea, a credit
analyst at Moody’s, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
