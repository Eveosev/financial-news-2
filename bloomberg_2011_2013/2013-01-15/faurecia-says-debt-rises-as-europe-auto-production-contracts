Faurecia (EO) , Europe’s biggest maker of
car interiors, fell the most in more than a year in Paris
trading after saying debt exceeded its forecast as auto
production in the region contracted.  The shares declined as much as 11 percent, the steepest
decline since November 2011. Faurecia was down 6.7 percent at
9:48 a.m. local time. The stock fell 25 percent over the last 12
months, valuing the Nanterre, France-based company at about 1.4
billion euros ($1.9 billion).  Net debt rose to 1.81 billion euros as of Dec. 31 from 1.53
billion euros on June 30, Faurecia said yesterday in an earlier-
than-scheduled earnings report. The company said that’s higher
than it expected, without giving a figure. Auto production in
 Europe  declined 13 percent in November and 18 percent in
December, leading to higher inventories and lower receivables,
the company said. Natixis had estimated debt of 1.65 billion
euros.  Faurecia, 57 percent-owned by  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG) , plans to
cut about 3,000 jobs in its home region, or 7.5 percent of the
workforce, by the end of 2013 as European auto demand is poised
to decline for a sixth year. Faurecia is pushing expansion
abroad with the goal to boost the share of sales outside Europe
to 55 percent in 2016 from 37 percent in 2011.  Second-half operating income tumbled 32 percent to 211
million euros, Faurecia said. Sales rose 7 percent to 8.6
billion euros as growth in  North America  and  Asia  offset a
decline in Europe.  Net income for the full year plunged 62 percent to 140
million euros, burdened by 84 million euros in restructuring
charges. The figure was below the 172 million-euro average of 13
 analyst estimates  surveyed by Bloomberg.  More than 700,000 shares were traded, 77 percent more than
the six-month average trading volume.  To contact the reporter on this story:
