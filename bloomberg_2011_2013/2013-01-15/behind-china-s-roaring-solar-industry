Wednesday,  Bloomberg reported  that Chinese solar stocks had soared based on market expectations that demand in China for alternative energy will increase given the Chinese government's increasing solar capacity targets. Earlier this week, China's National Energy Administration  announced its intention to add 10 gigawatts of solar power capacity in 2013 , more than twice its current level. According to Barron's and others, China has already begun implementing its ambitious plan to increase installations. It previously approved the Golden Sun initiative for the first half of this year and committed prodigious amounts of government cash to the sector. China has also begun offering subsidies for rooftop solar projects. These aren't controversial production-side subsidies (of the kind that have been challenged as contravening international trade agreements) but rather incentivizing domestic subsidies intended to help Chinese citizens and organizations to purchase solar systems at an affordable price. This week, the share price of Trina Solar Ltd. the nation's third-biggest maker of solar panels, jumped to the highest level in five months even as that of LDK Solar Co. rallied 7.7 percent. Although some commentators may see this uptick in China's solar investments (and equity values) as an intriguing short term phenomenon, we at The Boston Consulting Group believe it reflects a public commitment on the part of China's government to embrace clean energy sources and to seek economic growth that is less energy dependent, as well as these profound long-term trends: The tremendous boom in China's consuming classes, the phenomenal growth of its cities, the explosion in its housing sector and overall infrastructure, all add up to significant new opportunities for all kinds of companies. Likely winners could include house builders and their suppliers, the specialist furnishings businesses, the makers of household appliances, as well as suppliers of commodities such as corn, fertilizer, copper, cotton, steel, cement, oil, coal, gas, electricity, and providers of transportation equipment of all kinds. But even more, these growth trends in China represent tremendous new opportunities for companies capable of developing innovative solutions to some of the most formidable problems of the new world, especially those capable of creating sustainable, nonpolluting solutions (of the kind, for instance, represented by solar panels). We believe that billions of dollars, then, will be made not just in delivering clean safe energy to China's exploding urban centers, but also in providing China with higher-quality, safer, sustainable food. Billions of dollars will be made developing and marketing completely recyclable packaging, and end-to-end distribution systems that require 80 percent less energy and have total system loss ratios of 50 percent of the current model. Billions of dollars will be made in the water market — providing systems that conserve water and deliver clean potable water to a nation where droughts and polluted drinking water are still all too common. Billions of dollars will be made, too, providing health care to the 200 million plus over 65 year old Chinese population of 2020. The opportunities are there — what is your firm doing about them?
