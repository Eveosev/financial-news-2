Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the world’s largest
supplier of clothes and toys to retailers, agreed to acquire
personal-care brand owner Lornamead Acquisition Ltd. for about
$190 million.  Lornamead sells more than 20 brands, including
“traditional and heritage” U.S., U.K. and German lines such as
Finesse, CD, Aqua Net and Lypsyl, Li & Fung said in a  statement 
on its website yesterday. Lornamead’s sales in the year ended
March 31 were about $155 million, Li & Fung said.  “The acquisition of Lornamead will further expand our
market share in the beauty business on a global basis,” Li &
Fung Chief Executive Officer  Bruce Rockowitz  said in the
statement. “This is a very strong platform and will allow us to
deepen our relationships with major retailers across all key
markets.”  Li & Fung last year raised HK$3.9 billion ($503 million) in
its biggest share sale since listing in 1992 as the company
seeks acquisitions to spur growth. The company’s  stock  dropped
15 percent in Hong Kong trading on Jan. 14, the most in five
months, after saying operating income slumped 40 percent last
year because of weaker U.S. orders.  The company announced the Lornamead purchase after the Hong
Kong stock exchange closed yesterday. Li & Fung American
depositary receipts fell 0.3 percent to close at $3 in U.S.
over-the-counter trading yesterday, after the disclosure. Each
ADR represents two underlying common shares.  The Lornamead purchase excludes cash and the Yardley non-
U.S. business, which was sold separately in an earlier
transaction, Li & Fung said. Lornamead shareholders retained
some units, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
