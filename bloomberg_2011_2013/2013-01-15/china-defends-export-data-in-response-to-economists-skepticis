China’s customs administration said
every dollar of trade is documented, defending the quality of
 export  data that analysts at UBS AG and  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  said may fail to capture the true picture.  “Customs import and export statistics are based upon
actual customs declarations,” the General Administration of
Customs said in an e-mailed statement yesterday, responding to
questions submitted by Bloomberg News on Jan. 11. “In our
published export and  import  data, every dollar has a
corresponding customs declaration document to back it.”  China’s unexpected 14.1 percent export gain in December
from a year earlier spurred skepticism from economists at banks
including UBS, which cited discrepancies with other nations’
trade data. The Ministry of Commerce said today that exporters
hurried shipments before a waiver of inspection fees expired at
the end of the month and it was wrong to speculate that the data
was false.  “It’s good that China’s customs bureau is responding to
concerns, showing an awareness within the government of the need
to communicate with the financial and business community and the
public,” said  Louis Kuijs , chief China economist at Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc in Hong Kong, who previously worked for the
World Bank in Beijing. At the same time, “saying that all of
the data is backed up by customs declarations does not remove
people’s concerns about fabricated declarations.”  December Surprise  The gain in December compared with a 2.9 percent increase
in November and the 5 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of 40 analysts.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  fell 0.4 percent as of the
11:30 a.m. local-time break in trading after the nation reported
a decline in foreign direct investment at the Commerce Ministry
briefing in Beijing where spokesman Shen Danyang said the
December export numbers were accurate. Investment from abroad
fell 4.5 percent in December from a year earlier.  “There’s mixed evidence on on whether exports were quite
good in the second half of last year -- there’s some support in
the data but also some items that are a little bit odd,” Kuijs
said. “ China ’s exports to Hong Kong show very strong growth,
but when you look at the data from the Hong Kong side, the Hong
Kong imports from China are much less strong.”  Trade Zones  After the release of the December data, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and ANZ cited a divergence from overseas orders in a
manufacturing index, while Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. said the
increase could indicate exporters’ rush to finish year-end
orders and government pressure to report exports before the end
of the year to get closer to the official 2012 target of 10
percent trade growth.  “It is possible that local governments may have tried to
boost exports data by either making round trips in special trade
zones” or by exporting “earlier than otherwise in an attempt
to improve the annual exports data,” Goldman Sachs’ Beijing-
based economists Yu Song and Yin Zhang wrote in a Jan. 10 note.
“Having said that, there is no concrete evidence to suggest
this is what actually happened.”  Customs collects trade statistics “in accordance with the
relevant laws and regulations,” according to the agency’s
statement. Companies within special-trade zones, or bonded
zones, that have actual transactions with overseas partners are
included in the statistics, while transactions with domestic
companies aren’t included in data, customs said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
