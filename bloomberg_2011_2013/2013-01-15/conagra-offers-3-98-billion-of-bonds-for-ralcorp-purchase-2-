ConAgra Foods Inc. (CAG) , the packaged
foods maker that’s purchasing  Ralcorp Holdings Inc. (RAH) , sold $3.98
billion of bonds to help fund the acquisition.  The maker of Chef Boyardee and Healthy Choice meals issued
$750 million of 1.3 percent, three-year securities to yield 95
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, $1 billion
of 1.9 percent, five-year notes at a relative yield of 115 basis
points, $1.225 billion of 3.2 percent, 10-year bonds at 140
basis points and $1 billion of 4.65 percent, 30-year debentures
at 165 basis points, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Proceeds will go toward the Ralcorp deal which is valued at
$6.8 billion, including the assumption of debt, the Omaha,
Nebraska-based company said today in a filing.  The company previously sold debt in September, issuing $250
million each of 1.35 percent, three-year bonds; 2.1 percent,
5.5-year notes; and 3.25 percent, 10-year debt, Bloomberg data
show. The bonds due September 2022 traded at 101 cents on the
dollar to yield 3.13 percent, or 130.5 basis points more than
Treasuries, on Jan. 2, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The new bonds are expected to be rated Baa2 by Moody’s
Investors Service, Bloomberg data show.  Buying Ralcorp, which sells foods under retailers’ own
brands, will increase ConAgra’s private-label sales to $4.5
billion, according to the filing. The transaction will create a
company with annual sales of about $18 billion and more than
36,000 employees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
