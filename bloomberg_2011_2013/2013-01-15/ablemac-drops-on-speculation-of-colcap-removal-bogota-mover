Tablemac SA (TABLEMA) , the Colombian wood
products maker, fell the most in two months on speculation the
company will be dropped from the Colcap index.  Tablemac tumbled 4.6 percent at the close in Bogota,
bringing the decline this year to 11 percent. The Colcap, which
includes about 20 stocks determined by the Colombian stock
exchange,  fell 0.1 percent .  “It looks like Tablemac could very likely leave the
index,” said Carlos Andres Vallejo, a Medellin-based analyst at
brokerage Bolsa y Renta SA. The shares would face strong selling
pressure from funds that track the Colcap, Vallejo said.  The next re-weighting of the  index  will be after the market
close on Jan. 31, according to a statement last month from the
stock exchange. The stocks are weighted based on their
“adjusted market cap value,” according to the exchange.  Tablemac President Juan Fernando Vasquez said today in an
e-mail that there was nothing the company could do to prevent a
Colcap exit, since inclusion is based on the index’s
methodology.  “We’ve heard the same thing you have about a possible exit
from the Colcap,” Vasquez wrote in the e-mail. A drop from the
index would be “unsettling given that so many investors base
their portfolios on the index.”  Cemex Latam Holdings SA (CLH) , a cement company that brokerage
firm Correval SA said on Jan. 3 may join the Colcap, has gained
10 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
