Bulgaria invited bids for the
construction of the Plovdivtsi dam and water treatment plant.  The government will use World Bank financing to build the
reservoir, which will supply water to some 40,000 people in the
towns of Rudozem and Madan near the Greek border, the Ministry
for Regional Development and Public Works in Sofia said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The deadline for submitting bids is Feb. 26, the ministry
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
