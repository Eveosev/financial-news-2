Benso Oil Palm Plantation Ltd. (BOPP) , a
unit of  Wilmar International Ltd. (WIL) , rose the most in more than
two months after announcing it will open a $16 million oil-palm
refinery in  Ghana  next month.  The stock gained 3.6 percent to 1.45 cedis as of 2:51 p.m.
in the capital, Accra, the highest since October 25.  “News yesterday that Wilmar is going to open one of the
biggest oil-palm refineries in West Africa here in Ghana hit the
market today,” Xorlali Torsu, a trader at Databank Financial
Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone. “The news attracted
buyers. Those who have the shares are now holding on to them.”  The plant will be able to process 1,000 metric tons a day,
making it West Africa’s second-biggest oil-palm refinery, said
Santosh Pillai, the managing director of Benso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
