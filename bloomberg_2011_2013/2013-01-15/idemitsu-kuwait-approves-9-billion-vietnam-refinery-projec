Idemitsu Kosan Co., a Japanese
refiner, and its partners approved a $9 billion oil refinery
project in  Vietnam  to meet rising demand in the country.  The companies expect to start construction in the second
quarter of this year and commercial production in 2017, Tokyo-
based Idemitsu said in a statement. They’ve awarded an
engineering, procurement and construction contract to a
consortium formed by Chiyoda Corp., JGC Corp., Technip SA, GS
Engineering & Construction Corp. and SK Engineering &
Construction Co., according to the statement.  Idemitsu and its partners delayed deciding whether to build
the Nghi Son plant, south of Hanoi, at least three times as they
resolved issues including how to finance the project. The Nghi
Son plant with capacity of 200,000 barrels a day will be
Vietnam’s second after the Dung Quat refinery started commercial
operations in 2009.  Idemitsu and Kuwait Petroleum International Ltd. each have
a 35.1 percent stake in the Nghi Son project, while Vietnam Oil
& Gas Group holds 25.1 percent.  Mitsui Chemicals Inc. (4183)  has a 4.7
percent interest.  To contact the reporters on this story:
