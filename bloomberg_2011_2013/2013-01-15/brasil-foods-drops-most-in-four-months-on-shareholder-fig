BRF - Brasil Foods SA (BRFS3) , Brazil’s
largest foodmaker, dropped the most in almost four months after
a newspaper reported a shareholder conflict over a board
appointment.  The stock fell 2.8 percent, the most since Sept. 28, to
43.92 reais at 12:45 p.m. in Sao Paulo. Brazil’s benchmark
Bovespa stock index slid 0.3 percent.  The pension fund for state-run  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ,
known as Petrobras, doesn’t support the appointment of Brazilian
billionaire Abilio Diniz to BRF’s board, while stockholders
 Tarpon Investimentos SA (TRPN3)  and Previ, the retirement fund for  Banco
do Brasil SA (BBAS3) ’s employees, back the move, Sao Paulo-based
newspaper Valor Economico reported today.  “Investors don’t like shareholder conflicts,” Luiz
Roberto Monteiro, a broker at Renascenca DTVM, said in a
telephone interview from Sao Paulo. “The conflict may taint
management.”  Diniz is chairman of  Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo
Pao de Acucar , Brazil’s biggest retailer and a distributor of
 Brasil Foods ’s TV dinners and sausages.  Brasil Foods declined to comment on the Valor story,
according to an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
