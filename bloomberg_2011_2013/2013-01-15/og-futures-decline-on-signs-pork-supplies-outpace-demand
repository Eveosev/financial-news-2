Hog futures declined on speculation
that supplies of U.S. pork are outpacing demand. Cattle prices
rose.  Yesterday, wholesale  pork  fell the most in more than a
week, and meatpackers processed 431,000 hogs, up 17 percent from
a year earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed. On
Jan. 11, the agency said that pork  output  will be 23.302 billion
pounds (10.6 million metric tons) this year, up 2.2 percent from
a December estimate.  “We’re seeing supplies still a little burdensome,” Paul Beere, a grain and livestock adviser at Prime Agricultural
Consultants in Brookfield,  Wisconsin , said in a telephone
interview. “If there’s still a big bulge in supply because of
more production and higher weights, we’re going to see prices
continue to push lower.”  Hog futures for April settlement fell 0.2 percent to 87.7
cents a pound at 9:51 a.m. on the  Chicago  Mercantile Exchange.  Wholesale pork declined 0.6 percent yesterday to 83.42
cents a pound, the biggest drop since Jan. 2.  Cattle futures for April delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1.34825 a pound in Chicago.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement gained 0.1
percent to $1.51525 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
