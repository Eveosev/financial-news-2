Egyptian lawyer Ahmed al-Gizawy and
two colleagues were sentenced to jail and lashes by a Jeddah
court on charges of smuggling drugs into  Saudi Arabia , the
state-run Ahram Gate reported, citing unnamed judicial
officials.  El-Gizawy was sentenced to five years in prison and 300
lashes, while his colleague Islam Bakr, an Egyptian, was
sentenced to six years in prison and 400 lashes. A Saudi was
also charged, though no details were given by Ahram on his
sentencing.  Egypt ’s consulate in Jeddah intends to file an appeal
against the ruling, the state-run Middle East News Agency
reported, citing Adel Al-Alfy, Egypt’s consul general.  Gizawy was arrested last April at a Saudi airport.
Activists say Saudi authorities fabricated charges against the
human rights lawyer for his work with Egyptian detainees. He
pleaded not guilty.  Saudi authorities had called for the death penalty in the
first hearing, which started last July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
