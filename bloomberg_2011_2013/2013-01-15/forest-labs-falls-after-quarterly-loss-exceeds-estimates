Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX) , the
drugmaker that lost patent protection on its top-selling product
in March, plunged the most in three months after posting a
third-quarter loss wider than analysts’ expectations.  Forest fell 1.3 percent to $37.11 at 9:45 a.m. New York
time, after declining to $36.20 in the biggest intraday drop
since Oct. 16. The loss in the period ended Dec. 31 was 21 cents
a share after one-time items were excluded, the New York-based
drugmaker said in a statement today. The result compared with an
8-cent loss that was the average of 23 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales declined 42 percent to $678 million, missing the $774
million estimate of analysts. Forest’s revenue has been tumbling
after protection ended on the antidepressant Lexapro, once its
biggest-seller with more than $2 billion in annual sales. The
company is pushing to offset the decline with the sale of newer
drugs, including the lung treatment Tudorza and bowel disorder
medicine Linzess.  “The bottom-line is that we view these near-term numbers
as not overly meaningful as the focus remains on management’s
ability to launch Tudorza and Linzess,” Steve Scala, an analyst
with Cowen & Co. in  Boston , said in a note to clients Jan. 14.  Forest  shares  gained 22 percent in the 12 months through
yesterday.  Forest said it expects full-year profit at the lower end of
its forecast of 45 cents to 60 cents a share. Revenue may be
$3.1 billion to $3.2 billion, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
