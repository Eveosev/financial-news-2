Ron Peltier , head of the real-estate
brokerage business at  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A) , expects home
prices to climb this year after the supply of available
properties fell, he told CNBC.  “We have a switch from a surplus of inventory to a
shortage of inventory,” Peltier, the chief executive officer of
HomeServices of America, told the business news station in an
interview today. “Together with low interest rates and
affordability at an all-time high, I think we will see sales
units grow again in 2013 about 10 percent and prices in the high
single digits in terms of growth.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
