Imports of liquefied natural gas
into  South Korea , the world’s second-largest buyer of the fuel,
dropped 9.5 percent in December as prices rose.  Shipments fell to 4.32 million metric tons from 4.77
million tons a year earlier, data on the  Korea Customs Service ’s
website showed today. Still, the monthly volume was the second-
biggest in 2012, after 4.64 million tons in February, and
compared with 2.99 million tons in November. The average price
paid per ton rose to $762.74 from $750.07 while the total cost
of the purchases dropped to $3.29 billion, compared with $3.58
billion in the same period a year earlier, the data showed.  South Korea buys most of the cleaner-burning fuel under
multi-year contracts from suppliers including Qatar, Indonesia
and Oman. Last month’s purchases included 610,935 tons on the
 spot market  costing about $758.42 a ton from Belgium, Trinidad
and Tobago,  Equatorial Guinea  and Nigeria, the data showed.  State-run  Korea Gas Corp. (036460) , the world’s biggest LNG buyer,
said today that December sales rose 15 percent to 4.81 million
tons from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
