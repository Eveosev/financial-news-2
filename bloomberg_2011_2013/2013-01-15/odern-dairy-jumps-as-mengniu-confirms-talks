(Corrects third paragraph in story published Jan. 15 to
show discussions took place that didn’t yield progress.)  China Modern Dairy Holdings Ltd. (1117) 
surged to an almost 20-month high after  China Mengniu Dairy Co. (2319) ,
the country’s biggest dairy producer, confirmed it had been in
talks to acquire the supplier.  Modern Dairy jumped 9.9 percent to HK$2.55, the highest
close since June 2011. China Mengniu dropped 2.1 percent.  There were discussions, and there wasn’t much progress,
Frank Ning, chairman of Mengniu, said after delivering a speech
at a Hong Kong conference yesterday.  Buying Modern Dairy would give Mengniu more control over
its milk supply as concerns about safety in the nation’s dairy
industry linger. Maanshan-based Modern Dairy supplies Mengniu
with unpasteurized milk.  Excessive toxins were found in milk at one of the Mengniu’s
warehouses in 2011. The company blamed the contaminants on moldy
feed given to cows.  A Hong Kong-based investor relations representative at
Modern Dairy, who said his last name was Wong, declined to
comment on the talks or give his full name when reached by phone
today.  Ning, who is also the chairman of COFCO, said he didn’t
know when an agreement can be reached. COFCO, a government-
backed company that has businesses ranging from food to grain
trading, holds about 20 percent of Mengniu according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The two companies have held discussions on a possible deal,
Bloomberg reported in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
