Bahrain plans to seek 5 megawatts of
renewable energy projects by June, the nationâ€™s energy minister
said at a conference in  Abu Dhabi  today.  Abdul Hussain Ali Mirza said the oil ministry will tender
for 3 megawatts of wind power projects and 2 megawatts of solar.
Over time, the government wants to develop more solar power, and
these facilities would be the first step toward creating a
renewable  energy supply  for the Persian Gulf nation.  Speaking in an interview at a conference in Abu Dhabi,
Mirza said the nation wants to encourage renewable energy as an
alternative to fossil fuels.  Bahrain gets about 83 percent of its energy from natural
gas and the rest from oil, according to rankings by the
International Renewable Energy Agency published in November. It
said the country had no renewable power projects. The government
is working on a 25-megawatt waste-to-energy power plant,
according to Irena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
