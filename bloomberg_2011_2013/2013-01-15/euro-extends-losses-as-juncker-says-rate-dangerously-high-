The euro fell versus the dollar as
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said the 17-nation
currency is “dangerously high” after climbing to the strongest
level in 10 months against the greenback.  Europe ’s shared currency also extended losses versus the
yen after the remarks from Juncker, who leads the group of euro-
area finance ministers. The yen gained earlier from almost the
lowest against the euro since May 2011 after Japanese Economy
Minister Akira Amari said an excessively weak currency may hurt
imports and households. The Swiss franc slid to a 13-month low
versus the euro.  “If the exchange rate is very high, that’s going to hurt
trade and weigh on growth in the euro zone through trade
channels,” Sireen Harajli, a foreign-exchange strategist in  New
York  at  Credit Agricole SA (ACA) , said in a telephone interview.  The euro fell as much as 0.9 percent to $1.3264, the
biggest intraday decline since Jan. 3, before trading at $1.3306
at 5 p.m. New York time, down 0.6 percent. It touched $1.3404
yesterday, the strongest level since Feb. 29.  The 17-nation currency tumbled as much as 1.8 percent to
117.60 yen before trading at 118.14 yen, down 1.3 percent. It
reached 120.13 yesterday, the highest since May 2011. The
Japanese currency appreciated 0.8 percent today to 88.79 to the
greenback after weakening yesterday to 89.67, the least since
June 2010.  “It was said last year that the euro zone was at risk of
breaking, and I said last year that this won’t happen,” Juncker
told an annual gathering of business leaders in Luxembourg.
“The euro zone has become more stable after lots of efforts,
some from me. The euro foreign- exchange rate  is dangerously
high,” Juncker said.  Krone, Rand  Norway’s krone and  South Africa ’s rand were the biggest
losers among the dollar’s 16 most-traded counterparts.  The krone fell after central bank Deputy Governor Jan F.
Qvigstad signaled a persistent strength in the currency would
influence the bank’s next rate decision in March. It declined
1.2 percent to 5.5687 per dollar.  The rand slid after Anglo American Platinum said it will
shut four shafts, putting 14,000 jobs at risk and fueling
concern South Africa’s current-account deficit will widen. The
currency dropped 1.4 percent to 8.8162 per dollar and touched
8.8246, the weakest since Dec. 4. Metals and other minerals
accounted for 61 percent of South Africa’s exports in the first
11 months of 2012, according to government data.  Franc Drops  The Swiss franc depreciated past 1.24 per euro for the
first time since Dec. 7, 2011, as haven demand ebbed after
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said Jan. 10 the
euro-area economy will slowly return to health in 2013. The
currency fell 0.4 percent to 1.24 per euro and reached 1.2413.  The premium for three-month options granting the right to
sell the franc versus the euro relative to those allowing for
purchases surged to the most since at least 2003, as far back as
Bloomberg tracks the data. The so-called risk reversal rate rose
to as much as a 2.12 percentage-point premium for franc puts,
from 1.78 yesterday and 0.87 a month ago. A  put option  gives the
right, but not the obligation, to sell a currency.  The yen snapped a four-day losing streak against the dollar
after Amari said  Japan  faces risks from any excessive decline in
the yen, highlighting the limits on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s
campaign to drive down the currency to spur growth and defeat
deflation. While a weaker yen may help exporters, it also will
cause higher import prices, Amari told reporters in  Tokyo .  ‘Massively Short’  “The market is massively short yen because investors are
convinced it will weaken further on the back of the government’s
policy,” said Michael Derks, chief strategist at FxPro
Financial Services Ltd. in  London . “When positions are that
extreme, a comment like that from Amari can really swing the
market.” A short position is a bet an asset will decline.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the yen versus those on
a gain, known as net shorts, was 74,096 on Jan. 8, figures from
the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.
Net shorts totaled 30,447 on Nov. 16.  The  Bank of Japan (8301)  will review its 1 percent inflation goal
at its policy meeting on Jan. 21-22. Abe has called for the
target to be doubled.  Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman  Jim O’Neill  said
the BOJ must show it’s serious about inflation targeting for the
yen to weaken further.  Inflation Target  “Classical indicators suggest it is oversold,” O’Neill
said in an interview on “Bloomberg Surveillance” from London.
The BOJ “has got to show its going to take this 2 percent
inflation target seriously. Rather than just a goal, it has to
be a target,” he said.  The yen slid 16 percent over the past six months, the most
among the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Indexes, as Abe was swept to power. The
dollar fell 4.5 percent, and the euro rose 4.5 percent.  The dollar rose versus most major peers as investors sought
safety amid bets a political showdown over the U.S. debt limit
will hurt the economy. The limit was reached Dec. 31, and
Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said yesterday measures
he’s taking to avoid breaching it won’t work past each March.  Geithner warned of severe economic hardship should Congress
fail to raise the ceiling, which lawmakers have increased or
revised 79 times since 1960. President  Barack Obama  told
Republicans in Congress not to use the need for an increase in
the $16.4 trillion limit to force through new spending cuts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
