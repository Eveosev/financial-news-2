Thailand ’s baht climbed to a 16-
month high on speculation the central bank will allow gains to
counter inflation.  Government bonds  rose for a second day.  The currency rose for a seventh day, the longest winning
stretch since March 2011, after Bank of Thailand Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul said yesterday the monetary authority
won’t intervene in the market as long as the baht moves in line
with fundamentals. Inflation accelerated to the fastest pace in
13 months in December, official data show. A stronger baht would
help slow price gains by cutting import costs.  “Given the concern over inflation, investors probably
believe authorities won’t guide the currency lower, although
they may seek to slow the pace of appreciation,” said Shigehisa
Shiroki, chief trader on the Asian and emerging-markets team at
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  Tokyo . “The baht is rising with
other Asian currencies as we are in a risk-on mood with easing
concern about fiscal and debt problems in the U.S. and  Europe .”  The baht jumped 0.5 percent to 30.09 per dollar as of 3:10
p.m. in Bangkok and touched 30.05 earlier, the strongest level
since Sept. 9, 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 4.15 percent.  Appreciation in the local currency is driven by an
improvement in global investor confidence, Prasarn said. Global
funds purchased $1.6 billion more Thai sovereign securities than
they sold this month through yesterday and poured a net $237
million into equities, according to figures from the stock
exchange and Thai Bond Market Association.  The yield on the 3.125 percent government bonds due
December 2015 fell one basis point to 2.94 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
