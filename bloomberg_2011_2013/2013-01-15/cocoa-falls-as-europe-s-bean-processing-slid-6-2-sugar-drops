Cocoa fell in  London  after European
bean processing in the fourth quarter dropped to the lowest in
seven years. Sugar also slid.  Bean grindings declined 6.2 percent to 327,982 metric tons
in the period,  according to  the Brussels-based European Cocoa
Association. That was the lowest amount for the three-month
period since 2005. The median in a Bloomberg survey of 12
traders, grinders and brokers on Jan. 4 suggested processing
would fall 4 percent. Grindings dropped as some processors,
including Delfi Cocoa (Europe) GmbH, slowed factory rates.  “The ECA numbers are the lower end of expectations, but
they weren’t bad considering Delfi was grinding less in the
period,”  Jonathan Parkman , co-head of agriculture at brokerage
Marex Spectron Group in London, said today by phone. “So it’s
only slightly negative to the market.”  Cocoa for March delivery was down 0.5 percent to 1,444
pounds ($2,322) a ton by 10:14 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. It
gained 0.9 percent yesterday. Cocoa for March delivery fell 0.5
percent to $2,255 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  Cocoa pressing in Europe fell 18 percent in the second
quarter and 16 percent in the third, ECA data showed. Some
grinders curbed bean-pressing early last year after a drop in
demand for by-product cocoa powder reduced their profitability.  “Looking at  Europe  alone can be misleading,” Parkman
said. “When you add up all the other regions where beans are
processed, the drop in the fourth quarter we estimate will be
about 2 to 3 percent.”  Rising Profitability  Factories started ramping up rates again. Delfi is
increasing processing at its Hamburg plant after a six-month
slowdown, Karel Menu, the company’s managing director, said on
Jan. 7. Cargill Inc. has started to increase grindings after
slowing down earlier last year, Jos de Loor, president of the
cocoa and chocolate unit, said on Nov. 21.  “The grinds will be spectacular by the time we get to the
second and third quarters because the base comparison will be
very low,” Parkman said. “I expect to see double-digit
increases by then. The first quarter should already be
positive.”  White, or refined, sugar for March delivery slid 0.5
percent to $505 a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for March
delivery retreated 0.6 percent to 18.79 cents a pound on ICE.  Robusta for March delivery was 0.6 percent down to $1,960 a
ton in London. Arabica coffee for March delivery slid 0.6
percent to $1.524 a pound in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
