Rubber retreated from a nine-month
high as the Japanese currency climbed against all of its 16
major peers after comments by  Japan ’s economy minister raised
concerns the nation won’t try to further weaken the currency.  Rubber for delivery in June closed little changed at 312.1
yen a kilogram ($3,514 a metric ton) on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange. Futures reached 321 yen on Jan. 11, the most expensive
since April.  Economy Minister Akira Amari said Japan faces risks from
declines in the yen after it weakened 3.6 percent this year
against a basket of developed market currencies and an
excessively weak currency may hurt import costs and households.  “The yen rebound prompted some investors to cash in
profits,” Sureerat Kunthongjun, an analyst at AGROW Enterprise
Ltd., said by phone from Bangkok. Rubber may regain ground on
optimism over economic stimulus and reduced supplies during the
low production period, she added.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, speaking to
branch managers today, said the bank will continue to pursue
powerful easing. The government said last week it will spend
10.3 trillion yen in new stimulus efforts. The BOJ will review
its 1 percent inflation goal at a Jan. 21-22 meeting after Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe demanded it double the target.  Rubber for delivery in May fell 1.4 percent to 25,480  yuan 
($4,100) a ton on the  Shanghai  Futures Exchange. Natural rubber
inventories monitored by the bourse continued to expand,
climbing 1,824 tons to 101,482 tons, the highest since March
2010, the exchange said Jan. 11, based on a survey of nine
warehouses in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin.  Thai rubber free-on-board dropped 0.5 percent to 101.20
baht ($3.36) a kilogram today, according to the Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand .  To contact the reporters on this story:
