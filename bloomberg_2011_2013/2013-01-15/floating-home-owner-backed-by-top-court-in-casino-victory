The U.S. Supreme Court ruled for the
owner of a floating home in a decision that may shield dockside
casinos from some lawsuits by workers and customers.  The justices’ 7-2 decision limited the reach of federal
maritime law. The court said the disputed Florida home didn’t
qualify as a “vessel” under the law because it wasn’t designed
to carry people or things over the water.  The ruling is a victory for Fane Lozman, whose 60-foot,
two-story home was the subject of a years-long dispute with the
Florida city of Riviera Beach. The city, saying Lozman owed
$3,000 in dockage fees, used federal maritime law to seize the
home and later destroy it.  The decision is also a win for the casino industry and at
least 60 floating casinos. The American Gaming Association told
the justices that a ruling against Lozman might have forced
casinos to defend against a new category of lawsuits under
federal laws designed to protect seamen and harbor workers.  The case is Lozman v. City of Riviera Beach, 11-626.  To contact the reporter on this story:
