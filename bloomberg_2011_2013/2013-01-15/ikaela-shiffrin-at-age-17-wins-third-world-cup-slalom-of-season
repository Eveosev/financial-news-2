Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. claimed
her third slalom victory in her first full season on the World
Cup skiing circuit at the age of 17.  Shiffrin covered the two runs in Flachau,  Austria ,
yesterday in 1 minute, 51.45 seconds, 0 .85 of a second  ahead of
Sweden’s Frida Hansdotter. Germany’s Maria Hoefl-Riesch, the
reigning Olympic slalom champion who led after the first run of
the night event, was eliminated when she missed a gate during
her second run on the floodlit course.  It was the second straight slalom title for Shiffrin, who
also won in Zagreb,  Croatia , on Jan. 4 to become the first
American to win two World Cup races before the age of 18. Four-
time World Cup champion Lindsey Vonn, who skipped the Flachau
race, got her first victory when she was 20 years old.  Shiffrin got her breakthrough win on Dec. 20 in Are, Sweden,
and now leads the World Cup slalom standings over Slovenia’s
 Tina Maze , who was fifth in Austria. Maze leads the women’s
overall standings and has six wins this season, including one in
all five alpine disciplines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
