U.K. government bonds advanced for a
third day and 10-year index-linked yields dropped to a record as
a report showed inflation stayed at the fastest since May.  Sterling gained versus the euro for the first time in eight
days after an index of house prices rose last month to the most
in 2 1/2 years. Consumer prices increased an annual 2.7 percent
in December from a year earlier, matching the readings in the
previous two months, the Office for National Statistics said.
Retail-price inflation rose to 3.1 percent from 3 percent in
November.  The  10-year gilt  yield fell one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 2.03 percent at 9:47 a.m. London time,
extending their slide since Jan. 11 to seven basis points. The
1.75 percent bond due September 2022 rose 0.08, or 80 pence per
1,000-pound ($1,609) face amount, to 97.59.  The yield on U.K. 10-year  inflation-linked bonds  tumbled to
as low as minus 1.01 percent, the least since Bloomberg started
collecting the data in 1992.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.5 percent this
month through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. German bonds also dropped 1.5 percent and Treasuries
fell 0.3 percent.  Sterling gained 0.1 percent to 83.18 pence per euro,
halting its longest losing streak since October. The pound was
little changed at $1.6082.  The U.K. currency has weakened 1.6 percent this year, the
second-worst performance after the yen according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10 developed-market
currencies. The euro advanced 1.1 percent, while the dollar fell
0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
