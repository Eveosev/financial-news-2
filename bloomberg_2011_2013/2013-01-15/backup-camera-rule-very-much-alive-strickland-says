The delayed rule that would require
backup cameras in new cars remains “very much” on the table,
National Highway Traffic Safety Administrator  David Strickland 
said.  “The secretary and I talk about rear visibility every
day,” Strickland said today in an interview at the North
American International Auto Show in  Detroit , referring to U.S.
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.  The rule was delayed for a third time, with NHTSA missing a
Dec. 31 deadline to issue it. It’s under discussion at the White
House’s Office of Management and Budget as one of the most
expensive pending U.S. rules, with a stated cost of $2.7
billion.  “As an administrator, I don’t like missing deadlines,”
said Strickland, who as a congressional staff member helped
write the law requiring the rule. Automakers have opposed
placing the mandate on all vehicles, saying it makes sense for
larger cars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
