The University of Louisville
outscored the  University of Connecticut  by 21 points in the
second half to win 73-58 in its first game as college
basketball’s No. 1 team.  Russ Smith scored 23 points and Chane Behanan had 16 points
and nine rebounds last night in Hartford,  Connecticut , as
Louisville improved to 16-1, including a 4-0 record in the Big
East Conference. The victory came hours after the Cardinals
climbed two spots to No. 1 in the Associated Press poll.  Connecticut (12-4) opened a 34-28 lead at halftime before
being outscored 45-24 during the second half. Louisville took
control with a 19-5 scoring run and limited the Huskies to three
baskets in the first 13 minutes of the second half.  Louisville, which has won 11 straight games, next plays
sixth-ranked Syracuse on Jan. 19.  Fourth-ranked  Kansas  last night pushed its winning streak
to 14 games with a 61-44 victory over Baylor.  Ben McLemore scored 17 points to lead the Jayhawks, who
built a 33-20 halftime lead in improving their record to 15-1
and 3-0 in the Big 12 Conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
