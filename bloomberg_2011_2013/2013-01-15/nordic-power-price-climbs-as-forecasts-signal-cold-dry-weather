Nordic electricity for April through
June rose as forecasts for an extended period of freezing
temperatures and dry weather indicated an increase in
electricity demand and lower supply.  Low temperatures in Oslo are forecast to drop to minus 18
degrees Celsius (zero Fahrenheit) on Jan. 19 from minus 13
today, and sink further to minus 22 degrees on Jan. 23,
according to CustomWeather Inc. data on Bloomberg.  The next-quarter contract gained 1.7 percent to close at
38.30 euros ($51.12) a megawatt-hour at 3:30 p.m. on Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. February power rose 0.9
percent to 46.75 euros.  Power demand in the Nordic region can surge as freezing
winter temperatures boost heating demand. The region’s
hydropower reserves are 4.8 terawatt-hours below the seasonal
average and may decline to a deficit of 12.5 terawatt-hours in
two weeks, according to Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg. The
region, which gets more than half of its power supplies by
running water through turbines, had a surplus of 9 terawatt-
hours at the end of November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
