India’s rupee fell, retreating from
the strongest level in almost two weeks, on speculation
importers boosted purchases of the dollar.  The rupee declined 0.3 percent to 54.6375 per dollar as of
1:29 p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
rose as much as 0.4 percent to 54.3050 earlier, the strongest
level since Jan. 2.  “We are seeing importers buying dollars,” said Naveen Raghuvanshi, a trader at Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai.
“The rupee should stabilize at current levels, supported by
inflows.”  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX)  of shares breached 20,000 for
the first time since January 2011 today after the government
yesterday delayed a clampdown on tax avoidance to 2016 due to
the plans spooking foreign investors, who have pumped a net $1.6
billion into local stocks so far this year, exchange data show.
The rupee gained earlier on speculation the central bank will
reduce interest rates to boost economic growth after inflation
slowed to a three-year low in December.  One-month implied volatility in the rupee, a gauge of
expected moves in exchange rates used to price options, fell 15
basis points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 9.80 percent.  The central bank will lower its benchmark repurchase rate
by at least 25 basis points to 7.75 percent by the end of March,
according to 19 of 22 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The next
policy review is due Jan. 29.  Swap Facility  “The rupee should begin to appreciate on a broad and more
sustained basis as the Reserve Bank of  India  engineers monetary
policy easing,” analysts at Morgan Stanley, including  New York- 
based Rashique Rahman, wrote in a report received today.  The RBI announced a  swap facility  yesterday to channel
credit to the export sector, which will support the rupee,
according to Surbhi Ogra, an analyst at ICICI Bank Ltd. in
Mumbai.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.55 per
dollar, compared with 55.43 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 55.43 versus 55.26. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
