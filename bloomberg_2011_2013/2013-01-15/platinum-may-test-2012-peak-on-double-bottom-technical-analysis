Platinum may climb 5 percent to a
level near last year’s peak in the coming weeks, narrowing
gold’s premium over the metal or even overtaking it, after
forming a “double bottom,” according to Barclays Plc.  The price for immediate-delivery metal will reach $1,735 an
ounce after confirming the first low of $1,529.19 on Oct. 29 and
the second of $1,515.87 on Dec. 28, Dhiren Sarin, chief
technical strategist for Asia Pacific at Barclays, said today.
In 2012, platinum touched $1,737.25 on Feb. 29, the highest
level since September 2011.  Platinum, used to make autocatalysts and jewelry, has
advanced 11 percent in the past year, outperforming gold and
silver, on increased demand from the  auto industry  and amid
supply disruptions at mines. A double bottom is a chart pattern
showing a drop in price, followed by a rebound and then another
decline to near the same level, usually indicating support.  “As long as gold trades in a range-bound environment,
platinum has room to outperform further from current levels,”
Sarin said. Gold may trade in a range between $1,620, the two-
thirds retracement level after a rally from May to October last
year, and $1,725 an ounce in the short term, he said.  Spot platinum was little changed at $1,655.42 an ounce at
2:19 p.m. Tokyo time, while bullion climbed 0.2 percent to
$1,671.25 an ounce. Gold’s premium over platinum was at the
lowest level since April today.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
