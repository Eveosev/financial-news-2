Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE) , Poland’s
second-largest utility, plans to cut 3,180 jobs and save 864
million zloty ($280 million) through 2015 after electricity
prices slumped on the country’s economic slowdown.  State-controlled Tauron sees annual savings rising to 334
million zloty in 2015 from 239 million zloty this year, it said
in a regulatory statement today. The majority of the amount will
come from voluntary redundancy program, the company said.  “Our main target, which is increasing the company’s value
for shareholders, won’t be achieved without firm actions in such
a difficult environment,” Chief Financial Officer Krzysztof Zawadzki said in the statement.  Tauron is cutting costs as Polish power prices for next
year declined 21 percent in 2012 and reached a record low of
170.75 zloty per megawatt-hour today. Its biggest competitor,
 PGE SA (PGE) , also controlled by the Polish government, reduced its
workforce by 1,459 people in the first half of 2012.  “Polish utilities are heavily overcrowded,”  Pawel
Puchalski , a Warsaw-based analyst at Bank Zachodni WBK SA, said
by phone today. “It’s a good step but will help the company
keep costs in check rather than lower them as inflation will
increase the existing cost base.”  Shares Drop  Tauron shares declined 1.2 percent to 4.78 zloty at 4:39
p.m. in Warsaw, trimming this year’s advance to 0.6 percent. The
stock slumped 11 percent in 2012.  The utility will cut about 1,580 jobs at its generation
units, 1,400 at the distribution business and about 200 in its
heating subsidiaries, reducing the total headcount by about 11
percent, according to its statement.  At least 400 employees left the Katowice-based utility in
the first nine months of 2012 under its previous 1 billion-zloty
cost-cutting plan, the company said in a regulatory statement in
November.  Tauron had 28,069 employees and capacity of 5.4 gigawatt at
the end of June, while PGE had 44,250 workers and 13.1 gigawatts
of capacity. That compares with German utility  EON SE (EOAN) ’s 78,889
employees per 69,557 megawatts, according to its 2011 annual
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
