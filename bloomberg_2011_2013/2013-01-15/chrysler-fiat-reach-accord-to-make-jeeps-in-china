Chrysler Group LLC and its majority
owner  Fiat SpA (F)  reached a preliminary agreement with joint-
venture partner  Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. (2238)  to make Jeep
sport-utility vehicles in China for sale in that market.  The agreement was signed today at Chrysler’s Auburn Hills,
Michigan, headquarters, according to a statement. The accord
would require Chinese national and regional government review,
and Jeep would aim to begin sales within two years of approval,
Mike Manley, the brand’s chief, said in an interview this week
at the  Detroit auto show .  Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of Chrysler and
Fiat, is positioning Jeep as one of the main global brands for
both automakers. Marchionne, 60, plans to expand Jeep by adding
production of its SUVs in  China , Russia and  Italy .  Jeep is Chrysler’s top-selling worldwide brand. The company
is updating three models this year to build on 2012’s global
sales record. The 2014 Grand Cherokee, Patriot and Compass SUVs
will add newly available transmissions that help boost fuel
economy for all three models to as much as 30 miles (48
kilometers) per gallon in highway driving, Chrysler has said.  Jeep’s worldwide sales last year climbed 19 percent to
701,626 sport-utility vehicles, Chrysler said last week. The
brand topped its previous record of 675,494 set in 1999. U.S.
deliveries totaled 474,131 in 2012, accounting for 68 percent of
total Jeep sales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
