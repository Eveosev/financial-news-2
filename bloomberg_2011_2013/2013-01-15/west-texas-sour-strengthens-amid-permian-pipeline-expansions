West  Texas  Sour on the  spot market 
strengthened the most in almost a month as  Sunoco Logistics
Partners LP (SXL)  and  Magellan Midstream Partners LP (MMP)  prepared to
expand pipeline capacity from the Permian Basin to Houston.  Sunoco is moving 40,000 barrels of crude a day from West
Texas to Houston, with 70,000 barrels a day of capacity set to
open to Longview, Texas, and Nederland, Texas, before the end of
the first quarter, Joe McGinn, a spokesman for the Philadelphia-
based company, said in a phone interview today.  Magellanâ€™s Longhorn pipeline reversal expects to begin
moving 75,000 barrels of crude a day late in the first quarter
or early in the second quarter, increasing to 225,000 by mid
2013, Bruce Heine, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based spokesman for the
company, said in an e-mailed statement.  Production in the Permian basin, the largest U.S. oil
field, grew to 1.29 million barrels a day in December from an
average of 880,000 in 2009, according to a U.S. Energy
Department analysis of well data. The increase outpaced growth
in pipeline capacity out of the region, leading to a glut of oil
in Midland, Texas, the delivery point for West Texas Sour.  WTS strengthened $3.85 to a discount of $14.15 a barrel at
3:48 p.m.  New York  time, narrowing the most since Dec. 21,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The discount of West Texas Sour to West Texas Intermediate,
the U.S. benchmark crude, averaged $9.36 in the fourth quarter
of 2012, the weakest quarterly average since Bloomberg began
recording prices in 1991.  West Texas  WTI in Midland  strengthened $2 to a discount of $10.50 a
barrel to WTI in Cushing, the narrowest the discount has been
since Jan. 3.  In Canada, Western Canada Select, an oil-sands bitumen
blend, strengthened by $2.25 to a $36.75 discount to WTI,
according to Net Energy Inc., a Calgary oil broker.  Phillips 66 (PSX)  returned a crude unit at its 356,000 barrel-a-
day refinery in Wood River,  Illinois , to service after shutting
it down for repairs over the weekend, a spokesman said in an e-
mail.  Syncrude, a synthetic light crude produced from bitumen,
rose 60 cents to a $1.20 premium to WTI. A Suncor spokeswoman
said yesterday the company is planning a maintenance turnaround
at its 350,000 barrel-a-day upgrader in  Alberta  sometime during
April and May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
