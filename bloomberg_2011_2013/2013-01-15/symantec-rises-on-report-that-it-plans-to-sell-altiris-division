Symantec Corp. (SYMC) , the largest maker of
antivirus programs, rose to a high not seen since September 2008
on a report that it plans to sell Altiris Inc., a software-
management business acquired in 2007 for about $830 million.  Symantec advanced 4.7 percent to $20.85 at the close in New
York after the Wall Street Journal reported that the business is
for sale and drawing interest from private-equity firms.  Altiris makes programs that help companies track, install
and maintain their software on desktops, laptops, servers and
handheld devices. Steve Bennett, the former chief executive
officer of  Intuit Inc. (INTU) , began running Symantec in July and is
trying to turn around a company that has failed to keep pace
with shifting computer-security threats.  “Symantec is evaluating all of its options to create more
return for its shareholders and will have more information to
share at our strategy announcement next week,” Cris Paden, a
spokesman the Mountain View, California-based company, wrote in
an e-mail. He declined to comment on the report.  Symantec ousted former CEO Enrique Salem last year and
indicated it was exploring options for divestitures. Salem had
said he opposed breaking up the company.  Bennett has said he will update investors on his efforts
when Symantec reports quarterly earnings Jan. 23.  Symantec has long been dogged by a divided structure, with
its antivirus software business on one side and a large data-
storage business on the other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
