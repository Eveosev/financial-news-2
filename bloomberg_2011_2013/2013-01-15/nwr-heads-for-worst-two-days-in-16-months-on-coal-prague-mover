New World Resources Plc (NWR)  had the
biggest two-day drop in almost 16 months after the Czech mining
company missed its sales target for last year and said coal
prices will probably decline this year.  The stock was the worst performer and the most-traded in
the  PX (PX)  index today, dropping 5.9 percent to 89 koruna by close
in Prague. Its 11 percent back-to-back slump is the steepest
since September 2011.  NWR sold 9.7 megatons of thermal and coking coal last year,
less than its 10.3 megatons target, as demand from steelmakers
plunged, the Amsterdam-registered company said yesterday. The
miner will cut investment this year by 30 percent to 50 percent
to lower costs as the price of thermal coal, also known as steam
coal, is likely to decline, NWR said.  “Sales volumes were disappointing,” Bohumil Trampota, an
analyst at J&T Banka AS in  Prague , wrote in a report to clients
today. Coal prices in 2013 “are expected to be under a lot of
pressure and the price of steam coal should be down,” he said.  Europe’s benchmark price for thermal coal fell 16 percent
last year amid the continent’s economic crisis and  China ’s
manufacturing slowdown. The futures contract has retreated 1.3
percent this week to $100.10 a metric ton in the Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
