FirstEnergy Corp. (FE) , an Akron, Ohio-
based utility with customers in six states, reached a multiyear
agreement to put its name on the Cleveland Browns’ stadium, the
first time the National Football League team had a sponsor’s
name on its home field.  The agreement comes five months after Jimmy Haslam, bought
the National Football League team for more than $1 billion.  “This is a great day for all of us and it builds on the
momentum we have experienced as we enter into a new era of
Cleveland Browns Football,” Haslam said in a statement.  FirstEnergy has been a corporate partner of the Browns
since 1999 and is the current scoreboard sponsor. Financial
terms of the agreement weren’t disclosed in a joint statement.  Once approved by the Cleveland City Council, the Browns’
stadium will become the 23rd of the NFL’s 31 venues to have a
naming rights deal. The eight remaining NFL teams without naming
rights agreements would be the Atlanta Falcons (Georgia Dome),
 Buffalo Bills  (Ralph Wilson Stadium), Chicago Bears (Soldier
Field),  Cincinnati Bengals  (Paul Brown Stadium),  Dallas Cowboys 
(Cowboys Stadium), Green Bay Packers (Lambeau Field), Kansas
City Chiefs (Arrowhead Stadium) and San Francisco 49ers
(Candlestick Park).  The Browns went 5-11 this season, missing the playoffs for
the 10th straight year. Haslam, who is the president of Pilot
Travel Centers LLC, the nation’s largest operator of travel
centers and truck stops, in August bought controlling interest
in the franchise from  Randy Lerner .  To contact the reporter on this story:
