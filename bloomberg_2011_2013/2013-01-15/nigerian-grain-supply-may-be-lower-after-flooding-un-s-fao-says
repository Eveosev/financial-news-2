Nigeria, the world’s biggest rice importer, may have a
“significant impact” on the country’s crop and livestock
supply, the  United Nations ’ Food & Agriculture Organization
said.  Almost 2 million hectares (4.94 million acres) of crop
land, including rice, corn, sorghum, yam and cassava, in 14
states were lost during heavy rains and flooding from August to
October, the Rome-based UN agency wrote today in a country
 report  on its website. Rice and corn were the most affected.
Cassava, which can be used to make a type of flour, is a crop
Nigeria sought to expand to replace imported wheat. The west
African country is the third-biggest buyer of U.S.  wheat .  Field surveys by the Nigerian government during August and
September, which estimated that the country’s grain production
may increase about 5 percent from 2011, “did not take into
account the full impact of the flooding,” the FAO said. About
5.7 million animals were killed, according to the report.  Grain markets are still “well supplied” in  Nigeria  and
the sub region, and prices have declined, the FAO said. Corn
dropped by more than 25 percent in October from a peak in May,
before increasing slightly in November in the northern part of
the country.  To contact the reporter on this story:
