China ’s solar photovoltiac
installations may reach 31 gigawatts of capacity by 2015, said
Liu Qi, the nation’s vice minister and deputy administrator of
the National Energy Administration.  The official, speaking at a conference in  Abu Dhabi , also
said China is willing to advocate global policies that push for
a doubling of renewable energy capacity by 2030.  The comments shed light on China’s goals for expanding
solar installations. Earlier this month, the institution said it
was targeting 12 gigawatts of hydroelectric capacity, 18
gigawatts of wind and 10 gigawatts of solar this year in an
effort to boost power production without increasing fossil-fuel
consumption.  To contact the reporter on this story:
