Hong Kong   stocks  swung between gains
and losses after hitting an 18-month high as optimism about
increasing foreign securities investments boosted Chinese
shares, tempering concern about the  U.S. government debt .  China  Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s second-largest
lender by market value, rose for a second day after a regulator
said China can boost quotas for foreign securities investment.
 Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , which supplies Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target
Corp., dropped 2 percent after Deutsche Bank AG cut its rating
on the stock. AAC Technologies Holdings Inc., a supplier of
speakers to Apple Inc. lost 3.3 percent after the Nikkei
newswire said iPhone production may be reduced.  The Hang Seng Index was little changed at 23,399.56 as of
11:13 a.m., after earlier falling 0.4 percent and rising 0.4
percent. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of mainland
companies increased 0.1 percent to 12,012.97, paring a gain of
as much as 0.8 percent. The Hang Seng Composite Index was little
changed as about the same number of shares advanced as declined.  “Optimism on the fast pace of China’s financial market
reforms to bolster domestic markets and increase access to
foreign markets for locals is a continuing theme today,” said
 Gavin Parry , managing director of Hong Kong-based Parry
International Trading Ltd. “This is being tempered with an
impact on confidence over Obama’s ‘‘haywire’’ remarks for
markets for a debt ceiling solution, coupled with Apple’s impact
on regional supply chain names.”  Relative Value  Hong Kong’s benchmark index surged 23 percent last year as
 China’s economy  showed signs of improvement and as central banks
around the globe added stimulus. Shares on the measure traded at
11.3 times  estimated earnings  yesterday, compared with 13.3 for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 12 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped less
than 0.1 percent today. The gauge yesterday declined 0.1 percent
from near a five-year high as Apple Inc. shares slumped amid
concern about iPhone sales, offsetting a rally in Dell Inc.  Among other stocks that fell, Chaowei Power Holdings Ltd.,
a battery maker, tumbled 7.1 percent as an investor offers to
sell 150 million of its shares in the company.  The Hang Seng Volatility Index rose 1.7 percent to 14.51,
indeicating options traders expect a swing of 4.2 percent in the
next 30 days. Futures on the  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 0.2 percent
to 23,349.  To contact the reporter on this story:
