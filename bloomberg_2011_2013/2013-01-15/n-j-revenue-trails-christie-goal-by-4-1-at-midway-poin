New Jersey tax collections fell 4.1
percent short of Governor  Chris Christie ’s projections midway
through the fiscal year.  The $426 million shortfall narrowed after December revenue
beat forecasts by 1.1 percent, the first time monthly
collections exceeded Christie’s budget targets in the year that
began July 1. Income-tax revenue was 14 percent above estimates
last month, according to the state Treasury Department.  “The growth we continue to see in income-tax collections,
the largest and most important revenue source for the state, is
an encouraging sign that the fundamental strengths of the New
Jersey economy are driving the recovery forward,” Treasurer
Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said yesterday in a statement.  Christie, 50, a first-term Republican who plans to seek re-
election in November, signed a $31.7 billion spending plan in
June that counted on a 7.4 percent revenue increase compared
with fiscal 2012. He said last month that midyear budget cuts
may be needed.  November revenue missed Christie’s targets by 11 percent
after  Hurricane Sandy , which struck Oct. 29, kept shoppers and
Atlantic City gamblers at home. Christie has said collections
may rebound as rebuilding creates jobs.  Last month, the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services
said revenue for the rest of the fiscal year would need to climb
12 percent to meet Christie’s budget estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
