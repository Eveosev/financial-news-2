The  New Zealand dollar  fell versus
the majority of its 16 most-traded peers as yen rose after
Japan’s Economy Minister Akira Amari said an excessively weak
Japanese currency may hurt the nation’s imports, damping bets
policy makers will try to push it down further.  The Australian dollar was little changed versus its U.S.
counterpart before a report that may show an increase in
unemployment, adding to signs of weakness in the domestic
economy. Economists forecast that the South Pacific nation added
the fewest jobs last month since a drop in August.  “Data releases continue to suggest a softened domestic
outlook, and markets will gauge the upcoming employment report
as a key factor driving near-term policy expectations for the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia,” Eric Theoret, a currency strategist
in Toronto at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) ’s Scotia Capital unit, wrote
yesterday in a note to clients.  The kiwi, as New Zealand’s dollar is nicknamed, declined
0.4 percent to 83.96 U.S. cents yesterday in New York. It slid
1.2 percent to 74.56 yen after touching 75.53, the strongest
since 2008.  Australia’s dollar traded at $1.0565 after falling 0.4
percent earlier. It declined 0.8 percent to 93.81 yen after
reaching 94.66, also the highest since 2008.  Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials fell 0.5
percent. Crude oil futures declined 0.8 percent, while the
 Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  rose 0.1 percent.  The Australian dollar declined 1.1 percent over the past
year among the 10 developed-nation currencies monitored by the
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The kiwi gained 2.6
percent, and the  U.S. dollar  slid 3.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
