The Netherlands had its longest
traffic jams ever today during the morning rush hour because of
heavy snowfall, according to Dutch motoring association  ANWB .  The total length of vehicle backups on motorway and
multilane highways in the country was more than 1,000 kilometers
(621 miles) at 8:30 a.m., Arnoud Broekhuis, traffic manager at
The Hague-based ANWB, said in an interview today. The second-
longest was on Feb. 8, 1999, at 975 kilometers, Broekhuis said.
“The morning rush will seamlessly go over into an evening
rush,” he said.  Several flights were canceled or delayed at Amsterdam
Schiphol Airport, according to the airport’s website. Train
traffic in some parts of the Randstad area, which encompasses
the four largest cities Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht and The
Hague, was also disrupted, according to Dutch Railways NS. Trams
in cities including Amsterdam and The Hague also suffered
delays.  The national KNMI weather institute hadn’t issued a weather
alert for today. In cities such as The Hague snow was as high as
20 centimeters (7.9 inches), Broekhuis said. The ANWB advised
people to stay home. “Some will spend their entire day in the
car and won’t get anywhere,” Broekhuis said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
