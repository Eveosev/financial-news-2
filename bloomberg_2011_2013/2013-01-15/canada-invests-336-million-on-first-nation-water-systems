Canada ’s federal government said it
will spend C$330.8 million ($336 million) at more than 50
aboriginal communities over two years to improve water and
wastewater systems on First Nation reservations.  “Our government is committed to addressing water and
wastewater issues on reserves to ensure that First Nations
communities have access to safe drinking water,” Minister of
Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development John Duncan said in
a Jan. 13 statement.  Communities to see the water system improvements on local
lands include Canoe Lake, Saskatchewan; Tallcree First Nation,
Alberta; and Nazko First Nation in British Columbia. Canada has
about 1.2 million natives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
