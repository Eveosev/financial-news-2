Oil dropped from the highest level
in almost four months on concern that debt-ceiling talks will
harm the  U.S. economy  and as a gauge of New York-area
manufacturing contracted for a sixth straight month.  Futures in New York declined 0.9 percent after President
 Barack Obama  said yesterday he won’t bargain with Republicans
over raising the government’s debt limit and called for separate
discussions on spending cuts. The Federal Reserve Bank of New
York’s general economic index  fell  to minus 7.8 this month from
a revised minus 7.3 in December.  “Concerns about a possible U.S. default are starting to be
felt,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New
York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “This is going to
roil all the markets.”  Crude oil for February delivery decreased 86 cents to
$93.28 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since Jan. 9. Trading volume was 18 percent above the
100-day average. The contract increased to $94.14 yesterday, the
highest settlement since Sept. 18. Prices are down 5.5 percent
from a year earlier.  Futures were little changed after the  American Petroleum
Institute  said U.S. oil inventories grew 46,000 barrels a day
last week to 360.9 million. Crude was down 77 cents at $93.37 a
barrel at 4:57 p.m. in electronic trading.  Brent for February settlement dropped $1.58, or 1.4
percent, to end the session at $110.30 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange. February futures expire
tomorrow. The more-active March contract fell $1.32, or 1.2
percent, to $109.63. Volume was 29 percent above the 100-day
average.  Spread Narrows  The front-month European benchmark contract was at a
premium of $17.02 to West Texas Intermediate oil traded in New
York, the narrowest spread based on settlement prices since
Sept. 19.  The spread has shrunk since  Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) 
and  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  resumed service of the Seaway pipeline running
from Cushing to the Gulf Coast on Jan. 11 at a capacity of
400,000 barrels a day, up from 150,000 barrels. The link
provides an outlet for record supplies in the central U.S.  The Treasury Department has been using emergency measures
since the end of December to prevent a breach of the $16.4
trillion debt limit. In a letter yesterday to House Speaker  John Boehner , Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  said the department
expects to exhaust those measures “between mid-February and
early March.”  The debt ceiling has been lifted 79 times since its
creation in 1917, 49 of those times during Republican
administrations.  Standard & Poor’s  lowered the U.S. credit rating in August
2011 after the most recent showdown over the threshold.  Oil
prices  tumbled 7.2 percent the month of the downgrade and an
additional 11 percent in September 2011.  Risk Assets  “Some fears about the debt ceiling are coming into the
market,” said Bill O’Grady, chief market strategist at
Confluence Investment Management in  St. Louis , which oversees
$1.4 billion. “The debt ceiling was ignored for a while on
expectations that they would muddle through, but there’s a
chance they won’t. All risk assets are reacting.”  The dollar increased as much as 0.9 percent against the
euro. A stronger U.S. currency curbs the appeal of dollar-
denominated commodities as an investment.  The  New York  Fed’s Empire State Manufacturing Index was
projected to show a reading of zero, which signals no change in
conditions, according to the median of 54 economist responses in
a Bloomberg survey. Readings lower than zero signal contraction
in New York, northern  New Jersey  and southern Connecticut.  Retail sales increased 0.5 percent in December, Commerce
Department figures showed. The median forecast of 83 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for a 0.2 percent rise.  German Economy  Germany’s economy, Europe’s largest, probably shrank in the
final quarter of 2012.  Gross domestic product  may have dropped
as much as 0.5 percent from the third quarter, the Federal
Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today in a preliminary
estimate. It said growth slowed to 0.7 percent in 2012 from 3
percent in 2011.  U.S. crude oil  inventories  probably increased a second week
after production climbed to the highest level in almost 20
years, a Bloomberg survey showed. Stockpiles rose by 2.2 million
barrels in the seven days ended Jan. 11, according to the median
of 11 analyst estimates before an Energy Information
Administration report tomorrow.  Production advanced 17,000 barrels a day to 7 million in
the week ended Jan. 4, the most since March 1993, the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical arm, said last week.  Gasoline Supply  Gasoline  supplies  rose 2.7 million barrels, according to
the survey. An advance of that size would leave stockpiles at
235.8 million barrels, the highest level since February 2011.
Inventories of  distillate fuel , a category that includes heating
oil and diesel, probably rose 1.5 million barrels.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 538,005
contracts as of 4:58 p.m. Volume totaled 580,792 contracts
yesterday, 21 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.5 million, the most since Dec. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
