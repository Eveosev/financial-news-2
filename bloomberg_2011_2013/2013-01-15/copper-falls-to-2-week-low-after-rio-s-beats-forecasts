Copper dropped to a two-week low as
 Germany ’s economy slowed and U.S. lawmakers struggled to reach
an agreement to raise the nation’s borrowing limit.  Manufacturing in the New York region contracted for a sixth
straight month in January and German growth slowed more than
expected last year, separate reports today showed. President
 Barack Obama  said at a White House news conference yesterday
that he won’t negotiate over raising the debt ceiling, warning
of economic calamity if Congress fails to increase the $16.4
trillion limit.  “There are economic concerns moving forward with the debt-
ceiling issue, and markets came under pressure after Obama’s
speech,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision
Financial Markets in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.
“Anything tilting toward economic uncertainty is going to weigh
on copper.”  Copper futures for delivery in March lost 0.2 percent to
$3.6255 a pound at 11:08 a.m. on the Comex in New York after
touching $3.606, the lowest  since Dec. 31.  Since 1960, Congress has raised or revised the debt limit
79 times, including 49 times under Republican presidents,
according to the Treasury Department.  The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s general economic
 index  fell to minus 7.8. Readings below zero signal contraction.
Germany grew at a 0.7 percent pace last year, down from 3
percent in 2011, the nation’s statistics office said.  Prices also slid after Rio Tinto Group’s production of
mined copper topped analyst estimates, indicating ample supply.  Stockpiles monitored by the London Metal Exchange rose 1.1
percent to 333,275 metric tons, the highest since Jan. 27.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months fell 0.3
percent to $7,972 a metric ton ($3.62 a pound). Nickel, zinc and
lead also slid in London. Aluminum was little changed, while tin
rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
