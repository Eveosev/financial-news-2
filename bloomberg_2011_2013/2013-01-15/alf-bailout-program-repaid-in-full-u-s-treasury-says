The  U.S. Treasury  Department said
the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, had
been repaid in full.  Interest and other gains above principal repayments from
the program total $173 million, the Treasury said in a statement
today. Under TALF, a bailout program that started operating in
March 2009, the Federal Reserve lent funds to investors in
highly rated asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-
backed securities.  TALF supported the origination of almost 3 million auto
loans, more than 1 million student loans and about 900,000 loans
to small businesses, the Treasury said.  Accumulated fees collected through TALF total $856 million,
exceeding the total principal amount of TALF loans outstanding,
$556 million, according to the Treasury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
