Palm oil gained after soybeans
surged the most in more than six months yesterday on signs that
U.S. stockpiles are tightening, increasing concerns that global
oilseed supplies may dwindle.  The contract for delivery in March advanced as much as 1.8
percent to 2,413 ringgit ($803) a metric ton on the  Malaysia 
Derivatives Exchange in Kuala Lumpur, before trading at 2,399
ringgit at 11:03 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur.  Soybeans rallied 3.3 percent in  Chicago  yesterday, the most
at close since July 5, after a U.S. Department of Agriculture
report on Jan. 11 showed  inventories  fell 17 percent from a year
earlier to 1.966 billion bushels as of Dec. 1, the lowest in
nine years. Exporters sold 120,000 tons to  China , the world’s
biggest consumer, the USDA said yesterday.  “Over the immediate period, we should see prices
recovering because of the oncoming production down-cycle for
palm oil which is expected to ease inventory,” said Arhnue Tan,
an analyst at Alliance Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.
“This could add to concerns over soybean supply shortage.”  Production in Malaysia, the largest grower after  Indonesia ,
usually peaks in October and November before tapering off.
Output this year may match the all-time high of 18.9 million
tons recorded in 2011, Choo Yuen May, director-general of the
Palm Oil Board said yesterday. Production totaled 18.8 million
tons in 2012 while  stockpiles  reached a record of 2.63 million
tons in December, data from the board showed.  Refined palm oil for delivery in May increased 0.5 percent
to 6,734  yuan  ($1,082) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil for May rose 1 percent to 8,618 yuan a ton.  Soybeans for March delivery fell 0.2 percent to $14.15 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for delivery
in March advanced 0.3 percent to 50.62 cents a pound, extending
yesterday’s 2.5 percent rise at the close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
