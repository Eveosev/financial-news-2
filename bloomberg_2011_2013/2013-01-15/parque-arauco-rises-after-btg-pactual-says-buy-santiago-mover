Parque Arauco SA (PARAUCO) ,  Chile ’s third-
largest shopping-mall operator, rose the most in three months
after Banco BTG Pactual SA recommended buying the stock as a bet
on growing consumer demand in the Andean region.  Shares in the Santiago-based company  advanced  3 percent to
1,200.7 pesos at the close in Santiago, the biggest gain since
Oct. 18. The Ipsa benchmark index fell 0.1 percent.  BTG Pactual, an investment bank based in  Sao Paulo ,
initiated coverage of the shopping-mall operator with a buy
rating and price target of 1,500 pesos for the next 12 months,
25 percent above its current price. Chile’s gross domestic
product will expand 4.65 percent this year, outpacing  Brazil ’s
estimated growth of 3.5 percent for 2013, according to a
Bloomberg survey of analysts.  Parque Arauco “offers a back-door way to play the
consumption story in the Andean region,” BTG Pactual analysts
Marcello Milman and Gustavo Cambauva wrote today in an e-mailed
note to clients.  Mall Plaza SA, a unit of retailer  SACI Falabella (FALAB) , and
 Cencosud SA (CENCOSUD)  are the biggest and second-biggest shopping mall
operators in Chile, BTG Pactual said in its report. Falabella
and Cencosud are both based in Santiago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
