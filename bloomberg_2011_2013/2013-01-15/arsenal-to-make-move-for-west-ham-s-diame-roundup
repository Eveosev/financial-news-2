The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable Internet links.  Arsenal Chasing Diame  Arsenal may make a 3.5 million pound ($5.6 million) bid for
West Ham midfielder Mohamed Diame, the  Sun  reported.  Diame, who joined West Ham six months ago from Wigan
Athletic, has yet to sign a new contract offered to him by the
Hammers.  City’s Defense  Manchester City manager  Roberto Mancini  may try to sign two
players from Borussia Dortmund in case defender  Vincent Kompany 
loses his appeal against a red card, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  Kompany was sent off for a tackle on Arsenal player  Jack Wilshere  last weekend, and may serve a ban of at least three
games.  Mancini has his eyes set on Dortmund pair Neven Subotic and
Mats Hummels, as well as AS Roma’s Daniele De Rossi and Stoke
and England defender Ryan Shawcross.  QPR-Bound?  West Bromwich player  Peter Odemwingie  may join Queens Park
Rangers as the London club offers the Nigerian an increased
salary, the  Daily Mirror  reported.  West Bromwich had previously rejected a 2 million pound
offer for the 32-year-old, who they value at three times more.  QPR is willing to boost Odemwingie’s weekly wages of 40,000
pounds as well as offer him an automatic 12-month contract
extension should they not get relegated and a “survival
bonus,” the paper said.  Fulham Swoop  Fulham will have to pay 1.5 million pounds for Barnsley
right-back John Stones, the  Sun  reported.  Hull may bid as much as 3 million pounds for Fulham goal
keeper David Stockdale, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
