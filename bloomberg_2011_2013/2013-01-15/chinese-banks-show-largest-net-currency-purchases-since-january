China’s central bank and financial
institutions  bought  a net 134.6 billion  yuan  ($21.7 billion) of
foreign currency in December, the largest amount in 11 months.  Yuan positions accumulated from foreign-exchange purchases
increased to 25.9 trillion yuan last month from November, data
published by the People’s Bank of China showed today. That
compares with net sales of 73.6 billion yuan in November and
100.3 billion yuan in December 2011.  The yuan failed to appreciate against the dollar in
December for the first time in five months. The central bank
said in August that capital flows would be “basically balanced”
in the second half of 2012 and the size of any net inflows or
outflows would be small.  Data from the PBOC today also showed that  China ’s foreign-
exchange  reserves , the world’s largest, increased in each month
during the fourth quarter, rising to a record $3.32 trillion in
December. That completes a five-month gain, the longest streak
since August 2011.  --Scott Lanman. Editors: Scott Lanman, Sunil Jagtiani  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
