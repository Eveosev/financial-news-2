China’s stocks  rose to the highest
level in seven months after Citigroup Inc. said earnings have
bottomed out and Guosen Securities Co. forecast a rebound in
profits. Satellite-navigation companies led the advance.  Shanghai Electric Power Co., supplier of a third of the
electricity in  China ’s richest city, advanced 4.1 percent after
the company estimated profit rose 80 percent last year.  North
Navigation Control Technology Co. (600435)  paced a rally for companies
that will benefit from government-mandated use of domestic
navigation systems in vehicles.  GoerTek Inc. (002241) , a supplier of
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) , dropped 1.7 percent from a record.  “Market sentiment is very strong as the economy is on a
mild recovery path and regulators continue to come up with
positive policies such as allowing more foreign investment,”
said Dai Ming, a  fund manager  at Hengsheng Hongding Asset
Management Co. in Shanghai, which manages $190 million. “Even
if there’s a correction, the magnitude isn’t likely to be big.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  climbed 0.6 percent to
2,325.68 at the close, the highest level since June 1. It jumped
3.1 percent yesterday after the head of the securities regulator
said the government can increase by 10 times the size of two
investment programs that allow foreign investors to buy Chinese
stocks and bonds.  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 0.7 percent to 2,595.86 today, while
the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  fell 0.2 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55
Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, added 0.7 percent in  New York  yesterday.  Earnings Outlook  The Shanghai Composite has risen 19 percent from an almost
four-year low on Dec. 3. The measure trades at 12.9 times
reported earnings, compared with the seven-year average of 21.4,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg since 2006. Average
trading volumes were 53 percent higher than the 30-day average.
Thirty-day  volatility  was at 21.2, compared with last year’s
average of 17.1.  Analysts may start raising earnings forecasts as early as
this month, Minggao Shen and Ben Wei, Citigroup strategists,
wrote in a report today.  The CSI 300 and  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  may
advance another 15 percent to 20 percent in the first half, they
wrote. Further gains will be “reshaped” by government policy
meetings in March and in the coming fall, they wrote.  Profits will post a “robust rebound” and grow 25 percent
in 2013 amid recent improvement in economic conditions and last
year’s low base, Zhou Binglin, analyst at Guosen Securities,
wrote in a note today.  Economic Data  December economic data including industrial production and
fixed-asset investment as well as a report on fourth-quarter
gross domestic product are due on Jan. 18. Economic growth may
have recovered to 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter from a year
earlier, after sliding to a three-year low of 7.4 percent in the
previous period, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Shanghai Electric jumped 4.1 percent to 4.86  yuan , the
highest close since Sept. 11, after saying profit probably rose
80 percent in 2012.  Cosco Shipping Co. (600428) , a unit of China’s
biggest shipping company, slipped 0.7 percent to 4.13 yuan after
saying net income may have dropped 87 percent last year.  North Navigation jumped 10 percent to 12.96 yuan.  China
Spacesat Co. (600118)  gained 2.7 percent to 15.95 yuan. Beijing UniStrong
Science & Technology Co. climbed 1.1 percent to 19.07 yuan.  All tour coaches, long-distance buses and vehicles that
transport dangerous articles should install the Beidou
navigation system, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
yesterday, reiterating a government statement from earlier this
month. China launched the first satellite for the system in 2000
and a preliminary version has been used for traffic control,
weather forecasting and disaster relief work on a trial basis
since 2003, according to the report.  Foreign Investors  GoerTek, which makes acoustic devices for Apple, lost 1.7
percent to 39.90 yuan, snapping a five-day, 15 percent surge.
Apple fell to an 11-month low in New York yesterday after the
Nikkei newswire said orders for iPhone 5 parts had been cut
about 50 percent following lower-than-expected sales.  The iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund, the largest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., added 0.5 percent to $41.31 in
New York, as the prospect of greater foreign investor access
stoked appetite for the nation’s assets.  China can raise the level of quotas for the  Renminbi 
Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors and the Qualified
Foreign Institutional Investors programs,  Guo Shuqing , chairman
of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said at a
conference in Hong Kong yesterday. RQFII allows offshore yuan in
Hong Kong to be invested in mainland’s securities while QFII
permits foreigners to buy yuan-denominated stocks and bonds.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Allen Wan, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
