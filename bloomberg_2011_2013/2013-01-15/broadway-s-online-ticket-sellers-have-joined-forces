Two of Broadway’s biggest players in
the growing market to sell tickets online have combined forces,
two people with knowledge of the deal said today.  Key Brand Entertainment , owner of ticket broker
 Broadway.com , acquired  BroadwayBox.com , which offers discount
tickets, the people said.  Key Brand also owns  Broadway Across America , which produces
and invests in Broadway shows and tours.  The two people spoke on condition of anonymity because the
sale has not been publicly announced.  Almost half of all theatergoers surveyed last season
purchased their tickets online. Broadway.com was cited as one of
the most popular sources for theater news, according to the
survey by the Broadway League, a trade association of producers
and theater owners.  Created by Dan Geisler and his wife, Odeda Geisler,
BroadwayBox posts discount codes for Broadway and off-Broadway
tickets. BroadwayBox also sends out e-mail blasts paid for by
producers that promote discounts to specific shows.  The Geislers didn’t return calls.  High Fees  Key Brand bought Broadway.com, an online publisher of news
and interviews, in 2010. Broadway.com charges a fee of about 33
percent over the face value per ticket.  For “The Lion King,” for example, Broadway.com adds $37
in fees to the $115 full-price tickets. Ticketmaster, the show’s
primary online outlet, charges $8.50 in fees.  Key Brand is closely held and doesn’t disclose profits.  Muse highlights include Patrick Cole’s  philanthropy 
forecast.  To contact the reporter of this story:
