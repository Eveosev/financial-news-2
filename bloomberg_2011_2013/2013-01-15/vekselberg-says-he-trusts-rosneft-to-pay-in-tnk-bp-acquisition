State-run  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , Russia’s
biggest oil company, doesn’t need to sign a guarantee payment
letter after agreeing to buy TNK-BP, Russian billionaire  Viktor Vekselberg  said.  “We signed an agreement, any guarantee letters are
needless,” the Renova Group chairman told reporters in Moscow
today. “We deal with such a respected company as Rosneft, and
with its respected managers. We trust them.” Vekselberg agreed
to sell Renova’s stake in TNK-BP to Rosneft as part of the
third-biggest oil-company acquisition ever.  Rosneft agreed in October to buy TNK-BP, a 50-50 venture
between  BP Plc (BP/)  and AAR, a group of Russian billionaires, for
$54.8 billion. The company, led by Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin, will buy BP’s 50 percent stake in TNK-BP for $26.8
billion in cash and shares and has an initial agreement to
acquire the billionaires’ half of the company for $28 billion in
cash.  AAR is expected to invest the money in Russia, President
 Vladimir Putin  said on Dec. 22. Vekselberg, Russia’s second-
richest man, said he respected “the president’s wishes” and
will invest in the country because of Renova’s understanding of
“how the economy works here.”  The money will be invested in energy, technology transfer
and machinery manufacturing, Vekselberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
