Fiserv Inc. (FISV)  is buying Open Solutions
Inc. for $55 million and taking on $960 million in debt as the
account-processing provider seeks to bolster products and
services for banks,  credit unions  and other financial firms.  The acquisition will deliver at least $75 million in
additional annual revenue and cut costs by more than $50 million
annually over the “next several years” for Fiserv, according
to a statement yesterday. Fiserv expects revenue to grow 3
percent to 4 percent this year, while adjusted earnings per
share will increase 15 percent to 18 percent. Analysts are
 predicting  earnings growth of 12 percent to $5.77 a share on a
4.5 percent increase in sales to $4.72 billion, according to the
average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Brookfield, Wisconsin-based Fiserv, which has a market
value of about $11 billion, is expanding the billing and account
payments technology it provides for more than 16,000 financial
firms, including lenders, billers, mortgage and leasing
companies, as well as brokerage and investment firms.  Buying Glastonbury, Connecticut-based Open Solutions will
add 3,300 clients worldwide, and products tailored mainly for
community-based financial institutions that outsource their
banking technology.  For 2012, Fiserv said it expects to report a 12 percent
rise in adjusted earnings per share. That compares with its
previous forecast for growth of 11 percent to 14 percent, and
analysts’ projections for 13 percent growth to $5.17 a share.
Fiserv will announce 2012 results and 2013 guidance on Feb. 5.  Fiserv’s shares, which advanced 35 percent in 2012, fell
2.9 percent to $80.47 at the close in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
