Libya ’s Oil Minister Abdulbari Al- Arusi called for the formation of committees to review oil and
gas agreements that don’t take into account the interests of
Libya and its citizens, state-run National Oil Corp. said.  The reviewed agreements would then be presented to the
“political leadership of the country to avoid the confusion
that took place over the past years,” the Tripoli-based company
said on its  website  today. It didn’t give further details. Al-
Arusi was appointed Oil Minister in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
