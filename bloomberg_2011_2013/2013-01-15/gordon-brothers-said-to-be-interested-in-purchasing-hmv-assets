Gordon Brothers Group LLC, a Boston-
based liquidation, lending and investment firm, is interested in
purchasing assets of U.K. retailer  HMV Group Plc (HMV)  that may become
available as part of a restructuring process, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  The person declined to be identified because the matter is
private. HMV, the U.K.’s largest retailer of CDs and DVDs, said
late yesterday it planned to go into administration, a form of
insolvency protection, and would appoint Deloitte LLP to oversee
the process and seek a buyer.  Endless LLP, a private-equity firm that focuses on
companies in distress, also said today it contacted Deloitte
with a view to buying the company. Hilco, a U.K. retail
restructuring firm that owns HMV Canada, may also consider
bidding, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Gordon Brothers  has been involved in some of the largest
distressed retail cases in recent years, including the 2009
liquidation of Circuit City Stores Inc. and purchases of
companies including Polaroid Corp. Last year, the firm teamed up
with Hilco Merchant Resources LLC to buy the merchandise of
Betsey Johnson LLC, a bankrupt U.S. women’s fashion retailer.  Three calls and an e-mail to spokespeople at Gordon
Brothers were not immediately returned. A spokesman for Hilco
declined to comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
