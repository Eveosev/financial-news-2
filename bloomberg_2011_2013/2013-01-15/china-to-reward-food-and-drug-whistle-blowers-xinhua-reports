China  will give rewards of as much
as 300,000  yuan  ($48,265) to people who report food and drug
issues to authorities, the official Xinhua News Agency reported
today, citing a State Food and Drug Administration circular.  The per-case reward will “encourage the public to report
illegal activities,” helping eliminate potential food and
medicine safety risks, Xinhua reported. The SFDA increased the
maximum reward from the 50,000 yuan set in 2003 and expanded the
program to cover food as well as drugs, Xinhua said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
