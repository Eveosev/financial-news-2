The leu strengthened to the highest
in more than 11 months as  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said Romanian
bonds are eligible for its emerging-market government bond
index.  The currency appreciated 1 percent to 4.3432 per euro by
7:02 p.m. in Bucharest, the highest level since Feb. 3 on a
closing basis. Yields on  Romania ’s June 2019 euro-denominated
bonds slid six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, to 3.819
percent.  Romania is eligible for entry into the JPMorgan GBI-EM
Index Series, and is “currently slated for inclusion” in the
March 1 rebalance, the bank said in an e-mailed note today.
Inclusion, which is subject to final determination, will be in a
phased approach over a three-month period ending May 1.
Romania’s weighting on completion is estimated at 0.54 percent
in the GBI-EM Global Diversified index, according to the note.  “Romania’s inclusion into the JPMorgan bond index will
attract a lot of inflows from foreign investors which are
currency positive,” Esther Law, a senior emerging-market
strategist at Societe Generale SA in  London , said in a message
today. “This is especially true with the current low non-
resident holdings of local bonds.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
