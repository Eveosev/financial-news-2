Russia ’s car market may stop growing
in 2013, a foreign-business group said, ending a run of at least
four years of increases exceeding 10 percent as the country’s
economic expansion slows.  Auto sales in Russia jumped 11 percent last year to a
record 2.94 million vehicles, with gains slowing to a 1 percent
increase in December, the Moscow-based Association of European
Businesses said today in a  statement .  Demand in the country will probably “consolidate at or
close to its current level,” Joerg Schreiber, chairman of the
AEB’s carmakers committee, said at a Moscow press conference.
“The outlook for the market in 2013 holds little promise for a
quick return to growth at the double-digit rates enjoyed in
recent years.”  Bank Rossii, the country’s central bank, said today that
data for November suggested that Russia’s economy continued to
cool gradually, with industrial output and retail trade
stabilizing at “low” growth levels and investment slowing.
Gross domestic product in the third quarter expanded 2.9 percent
from a year earlier, down from 4.9 percent in the first quarter.  The AEB estimates that Russia’s automotive market this year
will total 2.95 million to 3.1 million cars and light commercial
vehicles, Schreiber said. Growth last year was the slowest since
2009, when the AEB widened its tracking of car sales include
Russian brands. Increases prior to 2012 amounted to 30 percent
or more.  Russia’s largest carmaker,  OAO AvtoVAZ (AVAZ) , and partners
 Renault SA (RNO)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  sold a combined 890,433 cars
last year, according to the AEB. Group deliveries in the country
by  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  amounted to 315,937, while  General Motors Co. (GM) ’s
sales totaled 288,308 vehicles.  Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) ’s Solaris,  Ford Motor Co. (F) ’s Focus and  Kia
Motors Corp. (000270) ’s New Rio were the best-selling non-Russian models
sold last year, the AEB said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
