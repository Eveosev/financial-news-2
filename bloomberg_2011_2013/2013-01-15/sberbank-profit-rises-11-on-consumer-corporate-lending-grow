OAO Sberbank,  Russia ’s largest
lender, said full-year profit jumped 11 percent as the bank made
more loans to consumers and companies.  Net income under Russian accounting standards rose to 344
billion rubles ($11.4 billion) for 2012 from 310 billion rubles
for the prior year, the Moscow-based bank said today on its
website.  Sberbank, which is controlled by the government, has become
 Europe ’s fourth-largest bank by market value as local lenders
and Russia’s economy weather the region’s debt crisis better
than their counterparts in western Europe.  “Balance sheet growth was solid as retail deposits surged
by 6.4 percent month on month,” Jason Hurwitz and Marina Karapetyan, Alfa Bank analysts in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed
report.  Retail loans expanded 42 percent in the year to 2.52
trillion rubles, while corporate lending increased 17 percent to
7.5 trillion rubles, Sberbank said. Net interest income, the
difference between what a bank earns from lending and what it
pays on deposits, jumped 23 percent to 638 billion rubles, the
lender said.  Non-performing loans dropped 25 basis points to 2.7 percent
of total lending at the end of last year. The company said
operating expenses climbed 19 percent in 2012 due to costs
incurred by the bank’s modernizing plans. A basis point is the
equivalent of 0.01 percentage point.  Its capital adequacy ratio, a measure of financial strength
calculated by the Russian Central Bank, dropped to 12.5 percent
at the end of 2012 from 15 percent a year earlier, a decline
Sberbank attributed to last year’s acquisition of  Turkey ’s
 Denizbank AS. (DENIZ)   Sberbank shares  slipped from their highest level since
March, losing 0.5 percent to 100.49 rubles by 12.52 p.m. in
Moscow trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
