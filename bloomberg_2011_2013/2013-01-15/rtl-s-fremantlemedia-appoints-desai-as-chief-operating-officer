FremantleMedia, the content-
production arm of  RTL Group SA (RTL)  behind television hits such as
“American Idol” and “The X Factor,” appointed Sangeeta Desai
as chief operating officer and chief financial officer.  Desai takes the newly created joint role immediately and
will be based in London, reporting to Chief Executive Officer
Cecile Frot-Coutaz, the company said in a statement today.  Desai previously served as chief operating officer at HIT
Entertainment Ltd., the London-based owner of children’s brands
including Thomas the Tank Engine and Barney that was acquired by
 Mattel Inc. (MAT)  in October 2011 for $680 million.  RTL,  Europe ’s largest television broadcaster, is working to
reduce its dependence on TV advertising sales by focusing on
online programming and content production. The company is
counting on more hit shows such as “American Idol” to
encourage pay-television operators and consumers to pay more for
its products. RTL said in August that it planned to step up
investment in FremantleMedia, whose revenue rose 16 percent to
720 million euros ($963 million) in the first half of 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
