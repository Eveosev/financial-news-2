6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, bringing the 2012 total to a

in the three months through December, the lowest for the period
since 2005, the Brussels-based industry group said in an e-
mailed report today. The total for 2012 was 1.29 million tons,
down 10 percent from 2011 and the lowest since 2005, according
to the report.  The  association  gathered its figures from 21 companies
