U.K.  natural gas  for within-day
delivery declined as milder-than-predicted weather tempered
demand for the heating fuel.  Same-day gas fell as much as 1.5 percent, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. The low temperature in  London 
was 1 degree Celsius (34 Fahrenheit) compared with a prediction
for minus 3 degrees yesterday, CustomWeather Inc. data show.  Gas for today slid 0.4 pence, or 0.6 percent, to 67.75
pence a therm at 4:43 p.m. London time.  Next-month gas  dropped
0.6 percent to 66.8 pence a therm. Thatâ€™s equivalent to $10.75
per million British thermal units and compares with $3.41 per
million Btu for front-month U.S. gas.  Imports from  Norway  were as high as 135 million cubic
meters a day, matching a record 135 million reached on Jan. 1,
Gassco AS data show.  An unplanned outage led to a 10 million cubic meter a day
production loss into the St. Fergus terminal for an unknown
duration, Total SA said on its website.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 367
million cubic meters, versus a seasonal normal of 309 million
cubic meters,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Gas accounted for 38 percent of U.K. power production at
4:40 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 39 percent, nuclear 16
percent and wind 1.5 percent.  Electricity for tomorrow was little changed at 53.90 pounds
a megawatt-hour, broker data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
