General Electric Co. (GE) ’s power
conversion business won a $10 million contract to aid in the
construction of the world’s largest wastewater treatment plant
in Abu Dhabi, boosting its operations in the region.  The company said in a statement that it would supply eight
pump drive trains, each with a power of 6.38 megawatts, as part
of pumping station work that’s making up a 40-kilometer (25-
mile) wastewater tunnel to collect and transport used waters
generated by the city.  When the plant is fully operational in 2030, its wastewater
pumps powered by GE drive trains will be able to treat as much
as 70,000 cubic meters of wastewater an hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
