Jim Armstrong will retire this year
as Augusta National Golf Club’s executive director after 34
years in the job, the club said.  Armstrong, 65, will be succeeded in his role at the home of
golf’s annual Masters Tournament by Will Jones, 46, Augusta
National Chairman Billy Payne said in a statement.  “Jim has certainly earned and deserves his retirement,”
Payne said. “I sincerely and genuinely thank Jim for his
personal and professional dedication.”  Armstrong has served under five of Augusta’s six chairmen
since coming to the private club in 1978. He will retire in
September, club spokesman Steve Ethun said in an e-mail. The
club didn’t provide details on Armstrong’s decision.  Jones has worked alongside Armstrong since 1993 and serves
as the Augusta, Georgia-based club’s senior director of business
affairs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
