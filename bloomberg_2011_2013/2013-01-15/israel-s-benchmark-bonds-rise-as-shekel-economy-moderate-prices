Israel ’s benchmark government bonds
rose, pushing the yield to the lowest level in almost two weeks
on investor bets a slowing economy and a strong shekel will ease
inflationary pressures.  The yield on the 4.25 percent bond due March 2023 dropped
six basis points, or 0.06 percentage point, the second-biggest
decline among similar-maturity sovereign debt of 23 developed
nations tracked by Bloomberg, to 3.96 percent at the close in
Tel Aviv. The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference
between the inflation-linked bonds and similar-maturity fixed-
rate government debt, fell two basis points to 211, implying
average annual inflation of 2.11 percent.  Annual inflation  may have stayed unchanged at 1.4 percent
in December, the lowest since July, according to the  median
estimate  of 13 analysts on Bloomberg. The data will be released
at 6:30 p.m. in  Jerusalem . The shekel gained 5 percent in the
three months ended Dec. 31, the best performer among an expanded
list of 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Economic
growth slowed to 3.3 percent in 2012, the  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said Dec. 31, compared with 4.6 percent in the
previous year.  “A slowing economy and higher unemployment are expected to
continue to moderate consumer prices,” said Rafi Gozlan, chief
economist at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage and Investments Ltd. “In
this environment there is a likelihood of another rate cut in
coming months which makes long-term government debt still
attractive.”  Cheaper Imports  A strong shekel, which is making imports cheaper, is also
having a deflationary effect, Gozlan said. The currency weakened
0.2 percent to 3.7310 a dollar at 4:50 p.m. as the  U.S. dollar 
strengthened against 13 of 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg.  One-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of
investor expectations for rates over the period, fell three
basis points to 1.7 percent, the lowest since Jan. 9.  Slowing growth has eased demand and helped to keep
inflation within the government target of 1 percent to 3 percent
since September 2011, the longest such period since 2007,
leaving room for central bank policy makers to cut  interest
rates  last month to 1.75 percent, the lowest level in two years.
The  next decision  is scheduled for Jan. 28.  The Tel Aviv Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, increased 0.1 percent to 281.96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
