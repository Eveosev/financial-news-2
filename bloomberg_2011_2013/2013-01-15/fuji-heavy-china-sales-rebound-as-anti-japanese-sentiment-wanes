Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (7270)  the maker
of Subaru cars, targets a 6 percent increase in global sales,
spurred by the introduction of a new Forester SUV model and
demand for its Impreza and XV crossover vehicles.  Deliveries will probably rise to 750,000 in 2013 from
706,612 last year, the carmaker said today in a statement. Sales
in  China , which posted the first rise in four months in
December, will climb about 32 percent to 57,500 units.  Fuji Heavy’s December sales in China rose 20 percent,
President Yasuyuki Yoshinaga said at a press conference in Tokyo
today. The gain is the first that a Japanese carmaker has
reported since a flare-up in political tension over disputed
islets in the  South China Sea  led to violent demonstrations in
China in September.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  and  Nissan Motor Co. (7201)  have
also increased discounts and extended guarantees to win back
customers.  “We thought we will have to wait until next spring to
recover, but it has shown signs that sales recovery may be
earlier than we expected,” Yoshinaga said.  Sales of almost 4,860 vehicles were helped by the
introduction of the new Forester, Subaru’s biggest seller in
China, and discounts on the older version, said Yoshiaki Tabei,
a spokesman for the Tokyo-based carmaker.  Toyota’s China sales in December dropped 16 percent to
90,800, bringing annual sales to 840,500 vehicles, 4.9 percent
less than in the previous year. Nissan sales dropped 24 percent
last month in China, while  Honda Motor Co. (7267) ’s fell 19 percent.  Lafayette Line  Fuji Heavy will use an existing line at its Lafayette,
Indiana, factory to increase output, including production of a
new model in 2016,Yoshinaga said. It will announce details at
the end of March on the plan to boost production, he said.  Sales in the U.S., its largest market, rose 20 percent in
2012 to a record, led by the Impreza hatchback. A boost in U.S.
capacity is key to the company’s mid-term target through March
2016, which includes 380,000 deliveries to the U.S. out of
850,000 shipments worldwide.  The Lafayette plant opened in 1989, initially as a joint
venture with truckmaker  Isuzu Motors Ltd. (7202)  It currently makes
Outback wagons, Legacy sedans and Tribeca sport-utility vehicles
as well as Camry sedans for Toyota under contract.  The factory can produce a maximum of 310,000 vehicles
annually, based on state air-pollution limits, Jennifer McGarvey, a spokeswoman for the factory, said last month.  Shares Doubled  Fuji Heavy gained 0.8 percent to 1,184 yen at the close in
 Tokyo , compared with a 0.7 percent increase in the Nikkei 225
Stock Average. Fuji Heavy more than doubled last year, the best
performer on  Japan ’s benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average, as the
automaker’s lack of manufacturing plants in China gives its
flexibility to ship more cars to the U.S. and Japan.  Fuji Heavy deliveries in China last year fell 24 percent
from a year earlier to 43,459 units. It targets annual sales of
100,000 units a year by March 2016.  The company -- the only major Japanese automaker not to
have received approval to manufacture vehicles in China -- plans
to eventually have a local production base in the country,
Yoshinaga said in an interview last month, without giving a
timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
