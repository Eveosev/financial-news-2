Hochtief AG (HOT) , the German builder
controlled by Spain’s Actividades de Construccion y Servicios
SA, jumped to the highest level since March after Goldman Sachs
Group added the company to its “conviction buy” list.  The shares  climbed  as much as 4.4 percent to 47.49 euros in
 Frankfurt  trading, and traded 4.3 percent higher as of 11:04
a.m. That extends the gains this month to 7.9 percent and values
the company at 3.6 billion euros ($4.8 billion). The 148,235
shares traded after two hours represent 93 percent of the three-
month average.  Hochtief, whose historic projects include Frankfurt’s
Commerzbank Tower, once  Europe ’s tallest building, is benefiting
from an industry upturn that has resulted in a 12 percent gain
in the  Stoxx 600 Construction and Materials Index  over the past
year. Marcelino Fernandez Verdes, the former head of ACS’s
construction business who became Hochtief’s chief executive in
November, is scheduled to present a plan to increase
profitability and reduce participation in high-risk projects on
Feb. 28.  “Hochtief has rallied since the new CEO was announced in
November, but with the rest of the sector up, we believe
Hochtief can go further,” Goldman said in a research note
today. “While execution will likely take time, we believe
clearer goals could increase investor interest.”  Profitability at the Essen-based company may be boosted by
anticipated process improvements in the coming years, Goldman
said. The investment bank previously rated Hochtief stock at
neutral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
