CTC Media Inc. (CTCM)  is rebounding from
the cheapest level versus peers since 2009 as Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. recommends buying the Russian television company on
prospects a focus on younger viewers will stoke revenue growth.  Shares of CTC traded in the  Nasdaq Composite Index (CCMP)  jumped
7.3 percent yesterday to $8.70 in New York, the biggest advance
since Aug. 7. The Moscow-based company traded for 9.3 times
estimated earnings, the highest valuation since Dec. 13. CTC’s
rally, the steepest on the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index
yesterday, narrowed its discount to companies on the  MSCI
Emerging Markets Media Index (MXEF0MD)  to 61 percent, from as wide as 67
percent Dec. 28, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  CTC’s revenue will climb 10 percent next year and about 11
percent in 2014 and 2015 as it wins more viewers with  original
programming  and as the company cuts costs, Goldman analysts led
by Alexander Balakhnin, wrote in a report dated Jan. 11. CTC,
which tumbled 11 percent last year as it took on a new chief
executive officer, is debuting new shows including ‘Angel and
Demon’ and ‘The Eighties’ as it seeks out viewers aged 10 to 45.  “The stock is undervalued, it’s a clear buy for those who
want exposure to Russia’s growth story,” Konstantin Chernyshev,
the Moscow-based head of research at UralSib Financial Corp.,
which has had a buy rating on CTC since May 2011, said by phone
yesterday. “CTC Media has a lot of potential for growth as the
company has a good management team, has stabilized its share of
viewers and is winning new ones.”  Increased Volume  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  rose 1.1 percent to
101.38 yesterday and  RTS stock futures  expiring in March held at
159,090 in the New York day. Trading volume in CTC Media’s stock
was almost four times the average daily volume for the past
three months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest dedicated
Russian exchange-traded fund, rose 1.3 percent to $30.14
yesterday. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected
swings in the  stock futures , decreased 0.3 percent to 20.58.  Under CEO Boris Podolsky, who moved from the chief
financial officer position on June 14, CTC will post an 11
percent jump in 2013 revenue, after an predicted 2.8 percent
increase in 2012, according to the mean of 12 analysts’
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. The company’s 2013 revenue will
rise to $872.7 million, according to forecasts.  Russian  television advertising  will probably rise between
10 percent and 15 percent in 2013 from 2012, fueled by an
expanding economy, UralSib’s Chernyshev said.  Ad Spending  Russia’s gross domestic product will climb 3.4 percent in
2013, according to the median of 25 economists’s estimates in a
Bloomberg survey last month. Economic growth probably
accelerated 3.5 percent in 2012, the government forecast last
year, slowing from 4.3 percent expansion in 2011.  Total spending on Russian TV ads is expected to increase to
 $5.9 billion  in 2014, the biggest market in  Europe , from $4.4
billion in 2011, CTC Media says on its website, citing estimates
by industry think-tanks, including Zenith Optimedia and Video
International.  CTC, which operates television channels in  Russia ,
 Kazakhstan , Moldova and broadcasts its programs in countries
including  Germany , the U.S., Thailand and  Israel , is switching
its focus to a younger audience beginning this year as it seeks
to attract more advertisers.  The broadcaster will direct its content to viewers aged 10
to 45 years-old, compared with the previous target of six to 54-
year-olds, CEO Podolsky told analysts on a conference call Aug.
7.  Local Shows  Proceeds from advertising accounted for more than 97
percent of company revenue in 2011, the highest level since
2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  CTC TV, the company’s main television channel, has changed
its strategy and is winning more viewership by broadcasting
domestically made shows, rather than Hollywood-made
blockbusters, Goldman’s Balakhnin wrote, adding that the new
strategy also helps to cut costs.  The largest non-government television broadcaster in
Russia, CTC said its  audience  of viewers aged six to 54 for all
of its television channels increased to 14.8 percent in the
third quarter, from 14.7 percent a year ago, and was the third-
biggest after NTV Television and TNT TV. The company cited TNS
Global as a source for the data.  CTC TV’s weekly audience of viewers aged 18 years and older
rose to 6.9 percent in the week to Jan. 6, from 5.3 percent in
the week to Dec. 30, TNS Global data showed Jan. 10.  VimpelCom Gains  “The launch of the spring season, with new episodes of
existing titles and scheduled premieres, should support audience
share dynamics and unwind inventory erosion concerns,”
Goldman’s Balakhnin wrote. “The quality of programming has
improved and the company is able to retain audience share
through more cost-efficient means.”  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , Russia’s third-biggest mobile phone company
by subscribers, rallied 1.5 percent to $10.75 yesterday in New
York.  Markus Bjerke, an analyst at Arctic Securities ASA in Oslo,
raised its recommendation on the shares to buy from hold and
lifted the price estimate on the shares to $13 from $10.60.  Crude for February delivery gained 0.6 percent to $94.14 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday, the
highest level since Sept. 18. It slid 0.5 percent to $93.68 by
8:25 a.m. today.  Brent oil for February settlement increased 1.1 percent to
$111.88 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
yesterday, before dropping 0.3 percent today to $111.58. Urals
crude, Russia’s chief export blend, rose 1.1 percent to $109.96,
and was down 0.1 percent today to $109.83 a barrel.  The ruble added 0.2 percent to 30.2540 per dollar
yesterday, the highest level since May 11. It was little changed
at 30.275 today. Ruble futures showed the currency strengthening
0.2 percent to 30.520 per dollar in New York yesterday.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 0.8 percent to HK$5.01 in  Hong Kong  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
