Iran  will send monkeys into space
next month as part of a plan to put humans into orbit, Hamid
Fazeli, head of the country’s  space agency  said.  “The monkeys that will be sent in a life capsule are for
now in quarantine and are scheduled to be sent into space during
the Fajr festival,” Fazeli said according to the  Mehr  state-run
news agency, referring to the 10-day celebration leading up to
the 34th anniversary of the Islamic revolution on Feb. 10.  The capsule named Pishgam, or Pioneer, will be carried into
orbit on a Kavoshgar rocket, he said.  Iranian President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  has described his
country’s scientific achievements as “miraculous” and his
government has portrayed Iran’s nuclear and space programs as a
symbol of independence from Western countries. The U.S. and its
allies are at loggerheads with Iran over its nuclear program and
express concern that its space projects may have military
applications.  The first Iranian-made satellite, called Omid, was launched
in February 2009. A year later, Iran fired a domestically
produced rocket into space with a satellite carrying two
turtles, a rat and several worms.  Iran may successfully send humans into space within five
years, Fazeli said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
