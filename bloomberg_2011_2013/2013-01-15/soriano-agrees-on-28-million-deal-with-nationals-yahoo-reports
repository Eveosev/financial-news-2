Rafael Soriano  agreed on a two-year,
$28 million contract with the Washington Nationals after
recording 42 saves for the  New York Yankees  last season in
Mariano Rivera’s absence,  Yahoo Sports reports .  Soriano, a 33-year-old right-hander, turned down a one-
year, $13.3 million qualifying offer from the Yankees in
November. His contract with the Nationals includes a $14 million
option for the 2015 season that vests if the reliever finishes
120 games over the next two years, Yahoo said, citing an
unidentified person familiar with the situation.  Rivera,  Major League Baseball ’s all-time saves leader, will
return to the closer’s role in New York after signing a one-year
contract in December. He missed most of last season with a knee
injury and Soriano finished third in the  American League  in
saves, going 2-1 with a 2.26 earned run average in 69 relief
appearances.  Soriano has 132 career saves, including a career-high 45
with the Tampa Bay Rays in 2010. The Nationals’ bullpen includes
25-year-old Drew Storen, who had 43 saves in 2011 before missing
three months last season following elbow surgery. The Nationals,
who had the best record in the majors last season at 98-64, also
have All-Star reliever Tyler Clippard, who had 32 saves in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
