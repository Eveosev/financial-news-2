Potential buyers of  Dell Inc. (DELL) , the
struggling personal-computer maker, would have a difficult time
getting enough funding to complete a deal, said Bill George, a
 professor  at  Harvard Business School .  While the cost of money is relatively cheap these days,
lining up private capital for a company with a market value of
about $22 billion and $9 billion in debt is a challenge, he said
today on the “Bloomberg Surveillance” show.  “It’s a real stretch,” George said. “Putting together
these funds is a lot tougher than people think.”  Dell, the third-largest PC maker, is discussing a leveraged
buyout with private-equity firms TPG Capital and Silver Lake, a
person with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Its stock
had lost 43 percent over the past five years, compared with a
3.8 percent gain by the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  George compared Dell’s situation with the slow efforts to
take Best Buy Co. private, saying some of the same people are
involved. Richard Schulze, Best Buy’s founder, has been working
with three private-equity firms, including Cerberus Capital
Management LP, on a takeover of the electronics chain, people
familiar with the matter have said.  Shares of  Round Rock , Texas-based Dell rose 7.2 percent to
$13.17 at the close in  New York , following a 13 percent jump
yesterday when Bloomberg first reported on the buyout talks.  To contact the reporters on this story:
