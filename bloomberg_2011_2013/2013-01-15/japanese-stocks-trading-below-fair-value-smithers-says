Japanese stocks are a better value
than U.S. equities and will extend gains even without further
weakness in the yen, according to advisory firm Smithers & Co.  Company profits in the financial year starting in April
will be “sharply higher,”  Andrew Smithers , chairman of London-
based Smithers & Co., which provides advice on international
asset allocation, wrote in a research note dated yesterday.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  traded at 10,937.62 as of
12:05 p.m. in Tokyo, poised for its highest closing level since
April 2010. The broader Topix Index advanced 1.2 percent.  Japanese shares of non-financial companies “are probably
selling below fair value,” Smithers said. “Profits are likely
to be poor in the six months to March, but to bounce back
thereafter. We expect the stock market to respond to the
improved short-term outlook.”  Earnings per share  on the Topix will climb 56 percent in
the next year, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
That compares with a 13 percent increase for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 27 percent for the Shanghai Composite
Index, the data show.  The Topix capped a nine-week advance, its longest weekly
winning streak since 1989 on Jan. 11, on Jan. 11 when the
Cabinet approved a 10.3 trillion yen stimulus package. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Nomura Holdings Inc.
are expecting Japanese stocks to extend gains as added economic
stimulus boosts earnings. The gauge is trading at 1.08 times
book value, compared with 2.20 for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index and 1.59 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
