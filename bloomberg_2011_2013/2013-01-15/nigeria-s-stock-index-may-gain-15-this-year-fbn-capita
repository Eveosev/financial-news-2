Nigeria ’s benchmark  All-Share Index (NGSEINDX) 
could gain 15 percent this year, with banking stocks expected to
benefit from “attractive” dividend yields, FBN Capital said.  The measure, which advanced 35 percent in 2012, could reach
32,250, the Lagos-based brokerage said in an e-mailed report
from  analysts Gregory Kronsten, Olubunmi Asaolu, Tunde Abidoye
and Uwadiae Osadiaye. The  gauge  traded at 29,687.80 as of 2:32
p.m. in Lagos, the commercial capital.  “In the very near term, we believe equities will see some
support because of attractive yields on banks’ 2012E
dividends,” the FBN Capital analysts wrote. The analysts set a
year-end target price of 8.2 naira for  Diamond Bank Plc (DIAMONDB) , FBN’s
“top pick” for equities. FBN gave an outperform recommendation
on Diamond,  Skye Bank Plc (SKYEBANK) , and  United Bank for Africa Plc .  “After some extremely disappointing years in the banking
sector, we believe that 2012 will be remembered as the year when
the long-awaited recovery in the sector finally arrived,” the
analysts wrote. The Central Bank of Nigeria set up the Asset
Management Corp. of Nigeria, or Amcon, which bought bad debts
from the nation’s lenders after a debt crisis in 2008 and 2009.
This enabled the banks to enter 2012 with cleaned-up balance
sheets, and with reduced loan-loss provisions, FBN Capital said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
