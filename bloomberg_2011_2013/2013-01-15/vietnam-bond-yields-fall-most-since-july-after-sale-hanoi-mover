with the two-year yield falling by the most since July, after
the government sold debt at lower interest rates. The dong was
little changed.  The  yield  dropped to its lowest level since February 2009
after the State Treasury sold 2 trillion dong ($96 million) of
364-day bills at an average yield of 7.69 percent yesterday,
compared with 8 percent on Jan. 7, according to a posting on the
Hanoi Stock Exchange website. Borrowing costs declined as demand
for sovereign notes increased at banks, according to Roy Fong,
director of fixed income at VinaWealth Fund Management Joint-
Stock Co. in  Ho Chi Minh City .  “The inflation trend is going down, so we think  interest
rates  will be coming down as well,” said Fong. “There will be
lots of liquidity in the banking system, which should push
investors to look at bonds.”  The two-year yield fell 20 basis points, or 0.20 percentage
point, to 8.40 percent, the biggest decline since July 30,
according to a daily fixing rate from lenders compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate on five-year securities dropped 15 basis
points to 9.30 percent, the lowest level since June 2009.  The value of outstanding loans increased by around 8.9
percent in 2012, according to a statement on Jan. 9 from the
central bank, which is targeting 12 percent expansion in credit
this year. Lending growth may be subdued in the first few months
of 2013, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said in his New Year’s
message posted on the government’s website Jan. 1.  Dong Steady  The interbank overnight deposit  rate  dropped eight basis
points to a four-day low of 3.63 percent, according to daily
fixings by banks compiled by Bloomberg. The rate has fallen 87
