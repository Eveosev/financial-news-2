A  Google Inc (GOOG) .-backed undersea power
line that will connect offshore wind farms to the U.S. eastern
seaboard will begin construction in 2016 with its first segment
off the New Jersey coast.  The first phase of the Atlantic Wind Connection will span
the length of New Jersey and carry 3,000 megawatts of
electricity, the Princeton, New Jersey-based project said today
in a statement.  The offshore cable is expected to be
operational in 2019.  There are no offshore wind farms currently operating in the
U.S. New Jersey has yet to put any rules in place for potential
offshore wind development, according to a statement today from
the New Jersey Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group.
Without offshore windmills, the undersea power line may be used
in the future to transport coal-generated electricity,  Jeff
Tittel , a director of the New Jersey Sierra Club said in the
statement.  The link “can make the grid more reliable and lower the
cost of energy in New Jersey by delivering both offshore wind
and conventional electricity to where it is needed and when it
is needed along the coast,”  Atlantic Wind Connection  Chief
Executive Officer Robert Mitchell said in the statement.  The project is also sponsored by  Marubeni Corp. (8002) , Bregal
Energy Inc. and  Elia System Operator SA. (ELI)  It aims to reduce the
cost of offshore wind power by creating a transmission line to
which future offshore wind farms can connect. The line is also
expected to reduce congestion and lower the cost of moving power
on the land-based grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
