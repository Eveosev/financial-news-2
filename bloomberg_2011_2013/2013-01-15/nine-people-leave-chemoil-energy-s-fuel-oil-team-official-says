Nine employees of the fuel oil team
at  Chemoil Energy Ltd. (CHEME)  have left the marine-bunker supplier,
said a company official.  Operations for the bunker, or ship fuel, business are
continuing, said the official, who asked not to be named because
of company rules.  Chemoil is the fifth-largest bunker supplier by volume in
Singapore in 2012, according to the city-state’s Maritime and
Port Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
