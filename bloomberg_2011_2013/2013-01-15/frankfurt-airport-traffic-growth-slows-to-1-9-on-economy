Fraport AG’s  Frankfurt  Airport
passenger traffic growth slowed in 2012 as recessions in Europe
and aviation-industry strikes reduced flight numbers.  The number of passengers using Frankfurt Airport, Europe’s
third-busiest, rose 1.9 percent to a record 57.5 million
travelers, the company said today in a statement. That lagged
behind the 6.5 percent gain posted in 2011.  The economy of the 17 nations sharing the euro went into
recession in the third quarter, and gross domestic product in
 Germany  expanded 0.7 percent last year, slower than the 3
percent gain posted in 2011. Weak demand from southern Europe,
fewer flights during the winter timetable and 3,350 flight
cancellations throughout the year stemming from walkouts by
airline cabin crews and airport security guards and baggage
handlers hampered traffic growth, Fraport said.  Even after passenger numbers missed Fraport’s forecasts,
“the full-year guidance for earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization is not at risk,”  Jochen Rothenbacher , a Frankfurt-based analyst at Equinet Bank AG, said
today in a report to clients. He reiterated an accumulate
recommendation and a share-price estimate of 52 euros.  Fraport  fell  as much as 1.8 percent and was down 0.7
percent at 42.80 euros at 10:49 a.m. in Frankfurt, the lowest
since Dec. 4, based on closing prices.  Earnings Forecast  The airport operator predicted in November that Ebitda in
2012 would rise at least 5 percent. The Frankfurt-based company
is  scheduled  to report preliminary full-year profit figures on
March 12.  Takeoffs and landings at Frankfurt Airport declined 1
percent in 2012, pushed down by a drop of 10 percent in
December, as airlines scaled back on cargo services and used
larger passenger planes, including Airbus SAS’s A380, Fraport
said today. Freight volume fell 6.9 percent to 2 million metric
tons.  Including airports and terminals that the company owns in
Antalya,  Turkey ; Burgas and Varna,  Bulgaria ; and  Lima ,  Peru ,
Fraport’s group traffic rose 2.9 percent to 99.4 million
travelers in 2012. Takeoffs and landings increased 0.4 percent
to 819,415 movements. Air-freight volume declined 5.8 percent to
2.36 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
