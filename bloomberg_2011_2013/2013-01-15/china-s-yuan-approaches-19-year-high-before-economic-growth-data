China ’s  yuan  approached its
strongest level in 19 years ahead of data forecast to show the
world’s second-largest economy halted a seven-quarter slowdown.  Gross domestic product expanded 7.8 percent in the three
months ended Dec. 31 from a year earlier, compared with a 7.4
percent increase in the previous quarter, according to the
median estimate of 53 analysts in a Bloomberg News survey before
figures due Jan. 18. The People’s Bank of China raised the
yuan’s reference rate by 0.01 percent to 6.2691 per dollar
today. The currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on
either side of the daily fixing.  “The yuan will continue to head higher but the moves will
be modest ahead of key data at the end of the week,” said Khoon Goh, a senior strategist in  Singapore  at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. “The fixing has been fairly steady.”  The yuan rose 0.09 percent to 6.2136 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The currency reached 6.2124 yesterday, the strongest level since
the government unified official and market exchange rates at the
end of 1993.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange rates used to price options, slipped five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.60 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the
yuan fell 0.11 percent to 6.1905 per dollar.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards slipped 0.05 percent
to 6.2840 per dollar in  Hong Kong , a 1.1 percent discount to the
onshore spot rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yuan may strengthen less than 3 percent this year,
according to a front-page commentary in today’s China Securities
Journal, citing unidentified analysts as saying. The Chinese
economy may grow more than 7.5 percent, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
