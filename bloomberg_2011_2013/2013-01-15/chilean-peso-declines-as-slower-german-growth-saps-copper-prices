Chile’s peso dropped for a third
straight day as copper, the nation’s biggest export, fell after
report showed  Germany ’s economic growth slowed in 2012.  The currency also fell on speculation the central bank may
take steps to slow its advance after the peso touched a three-
month intraday high of 469.10 per dollar on Jan. 8.  “Below 470, fears of verbal intervention increase though
we don’t expect actual intervention until below 460,” said
Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago, referring to the dollar versus the peso.  The peso declined 0.2 percent to 474.6 per  U.S. dollar  at
9:51 a.m. in Santiago. The euro slid 0.4 percent. Futures on
copper dropped 0.5 percent to $3.6315 a pound in  New York .  Germany’s gross domestic product may have dropped as much
as 0.5 percent in the final three months of last year from the
third quarter, the Federal Statistics Office reported today in a
preliminary estimate, leaving  Europe ’s largest economy at the
brink of recession. It reported that economic growth slowed to
0.7 percent in 2012 from 3 percent in 2011. Copper, used in new
homes and cars, often rises or falls on changing expectations
for global expansion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
