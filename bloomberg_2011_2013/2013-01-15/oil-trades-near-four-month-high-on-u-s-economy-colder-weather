Oil traded near the highest level in
almost four months in  New York  before reports that may show the
economy recovering in the U.S. and as lower temperatures buoy
demand for heating fuels.  West Texas Intermediate was little changed after climbing
0.6 percent yesterday. The U.S. East Coast and Midwest will be 5
degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 Celsius) below normal from Jan. 19 to
Jan. 23, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,
 Maryland .  Retail sales  probably rose for a second month in
December, a Bloomberg News survey of economists predicted before
Commerce Department data today.  “Colder weather is helping the energy complex,” said
 Andrey Kryuchenkov , an analyst at VTB Capital in  London , who
predicts WTI may remain capped at about $95.60 a barrel. “The
global oil market looks evenly balanced.”  Crude for February delivery was at $93.70 a barrel, down 44
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 12:55 p.m. London time. The contract increased to $94.14
yesterday, the highest settlement since Sept. 18. Prices dropped
7.1 percent last year.  Brent for February settlement was at $111.58 a barrel, down
30 cents, on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
more-active March contract slipped 20 cents to $110.75. The
front-month European benchmark contract was at a premium of
$17.89 to WTI futures. It settled at $17.08 on Jan. 11, the
narrowest since Sept. 19.  Retail Sales  U.S. retail sales may have increased as consumers looked
beyond the year-end budget battle among lawmakers. The 0.2
percent increase in follow a 0.3 percent gain in November,
according to the median forecast of 83 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. Other figures may show New York-area manufacturing
stabilized, and wholesale costs were contained.  The nation’s crude stockpiles probably gained by 2.4
million barrels last week, according to a Bloomberg News survey
before an Energy Department report tomorrow.  U.S. gasoline supplies rose by 2.6 million barrels in the
seven days ended Jan. 11 for an eighth weekly gain, according to
the median estimate of eight analysts in the Bloomberg survey
before tomorrow’s report. Distillate inventories, a category
that includes heating oil and diesel, probably increased by 1.5
million barrels.  Gasoil for February delivery advanced as much as $12, or
1.3 percent, to $966.50 on the ICE exchange. That’s the most
since Oct. 30.  U.S. oil output advanced to 7 million barrels a day in the
week ended Jan. 4, the most since March 1993, data from the
Energy Department show.  The  American Petroleum Institute  is scheduled to release
separate data today. The API collects stockpile information on a
voluntary basis from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and
pipelines. The government requires that reports be filed with
the Energy Department for its weekly survey.  The 14-day relative strength index for WTI climbed above 70
yesterday for the second time in three days, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. That level signals a market is overbought
and may decline. Today’s reading is 66.8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
