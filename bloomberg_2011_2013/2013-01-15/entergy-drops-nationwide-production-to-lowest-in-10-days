U.S. nuclear-power production
dropped the most in 10 days after an  Entergy Corp. (ETR)  reactor in
 Mississippi  tripped offline.  Nationwide production fell 1.5 percent to 92,462 megawatts,
or 91 percent of capacity, the biggest daily decline since Jan.
5, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data compiled
by Bloomberg. Output was down 1 percent from a year ago with
nine of 104 plants offline.  Entergyâ€™s 1,297-megawatt Grand Gulf 1 reactor shut
automatically because of a turbine trip, according to a report
to the commission. The plant is about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
southwest of Vicksburg.  Entergy slowed production to 84 percent of capacity at its
651-megawatt Vermont Yankee 1 reactor from full power yesterday.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
