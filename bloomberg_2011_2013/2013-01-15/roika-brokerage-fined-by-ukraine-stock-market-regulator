Troika Dialog Ukraine, the local
unit of  Russia ’s OAO Sberbank, was fined by the Ukrainian stock
market regulator for “manipulating securities” and receiving
an “unjustified profit.”  The National Stocks and Securities Commission fined Troika
170,000 hryvnia ($10,879) for actions on March 15 that changed
the benchmark index of Ukrainian Exchange, the UX, with the
purpose of making a profit in operations with futures, the
regulator said in a statement on its website today.  “The commission studied the situation comprehensively,”
acting head Anatoliy Amelin said in the statement. A detailed
analysis proved there was “manipulation with prices.”  “We regard the commission’s decision today as unjustified
and unlawful,” Troika’s press service said in e-mailed
statement. “We are going to challenge this decision according
to the law.”  The commission started a case against Troika in December,
according to its website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
