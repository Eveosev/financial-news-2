  South Korea ’s imports of oil from
 Iran  increased 24 percent in December from a year earlier.  Purchases last month were 793,361 metric tons, equivalent
to about 188,000 barrels a day, compared with 639,281 tons a
year earlier, according to data posted on  the Korea Customs
Service ’s website today. The volume dropped from 814,797 tons in
November, the data showed.  South Korea halted imports of Iranian crude in August and
September after the start of a European Union ban on insurance
coverage for tankers carrying oil from the Persian Gulf nation.
The injunction was a part of sanctions by Western countries
intended to pressure Iran to stop its nuclear program, which the
U.S. and  Israel  say is aimed at developing atomic weapons.  South Korean refiners  SK Innovation Co. (096770)  and Hyundai Oilbank
Co. resumed shipments after Iran offered its own vessels.  Imports from Iran fell 37 percent from 2011 to 7.79 million
tons in 2012, according to the customs data. That was the
equivalent of 6 percent of its total purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
