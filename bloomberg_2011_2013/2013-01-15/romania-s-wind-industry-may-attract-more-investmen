Romania  may attract more investors
in wind farms this year and in 2014 because of government
incentives, according to  Monsson Group , the biggest wind-park
developer in the country.  Monsson, a privately-held company, has wind projects of
about 2,400 megawatts in Romania, out of which 1,700 megawatts
already got approval from the local power grid operator,  Arne
Osborg , the group’s chairman, said in a presentation in
Bucharest today. The group has sold projects with combined
capacity of about 850 megawatts, including to  CEZ AS (CEZ) , and built
818 megawatts, according to the company’s presentation.  “There’s a window of opportunity and anyone who hasn’t
invested or committed to building these projects should consider
doing so quite quickly, because otherwise they might miss this
window and as time goes by, profitability increases
automatically without any regulator having to change any laws,”
Osborg said.  Romania is attracting investors including  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, CEZ
and  Enel SpA (ENEL)  because of its renewables incentive program, which
grants green certificates for energy produced from renewable
sources that power distributors must buy. The country’s
installed capacity may double in two to three years from 2
gigawatts at the end of 2012, Osborg said.  “The Romanian wind sector is very attractive and the
growth outlook, wind conditions, regulation, grid make this
sector one of the main investor targets globally,” Osborg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
