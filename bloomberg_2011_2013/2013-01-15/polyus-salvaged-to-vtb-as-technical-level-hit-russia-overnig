Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PLZLY) , the
worst performer among the most-traded Russian stocks in the U.S.
this year, drew five times its daily average of trades as VTB
Capital said the stock is poised to recoup losses.  Global depositary receipts of Polyus, Russia’s top producer
of gold, rose 1.3 percent to $3.07 in New York yesterday, its
first advance in 10 days on volume five times the daily average
over the past three months. The stock rebounded after its 14-day
 relative strength index  fell to 29.2 Jan. 14, below the 30 level
that signals a drop has been excessive and may reverse. The last
time the RSI was below 30, on Aug. 15, Polyus jumped 12 percent
the  next month .  “Polyus has been lagging behind and has a lot of catching
up to do,” Nikolay Sosnovskiy, a metals analyst at VTB Capital,
a unit of Russia’s second-largest bank, said by phone from
Moscow yesterday.  Sosnovskiy is predicting Polyus will advance 49 percent in
 London , after retreating more than 5 percent there and in New
York this year. The shares fell as billionaire  Mikhail Prokhorov 
said in September that he wanted to sell all or part of his
stake and as concern grew over mine delays. Futures on Moscow’s
RTS stock index added 0.2 percent to 157,860 in U.S. hours,
while the Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of Russian equities
in the U.S. fell 0.2 percent to 101.18.  Polyus traded at 11.2 times estimated earnings in New York
yesterday, rising from a four-month low of 11 times reached Jan.
14. The London-based company also rose in London, where the 
stock  climbed 1.6 percent to 194 pence, or $3.12, the biggest
gain since Dec. 21. Trading volume rose to 139 percent of the
three-month average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Surge Expected  Shares of the Moscow-based company traded on  Russia ’s Micex
Index fell for a third day, declining 0.5 percent to 983.30
rubles, or the equivalent of $32.49 yesterday.  VTB’s Sosnovskiy has a 290 pence price target on Polyus’
London-listed shares, indicating expectations of a 50 percent
advance over the next 12 months. He rates the London-listed
stock buy and the Micex-traded shares hold.  Shares are set to surge as much as 30 percent in 2013 as
 gold prices  extend gains and the company boosts output, Ilya Kravets, who helps manage $100 million of assets at Daniloff
Capital LLC in New York including Polyus stock, said.  “Polyus is fundamentally undervalued and has a huge
potential for growth,” Kravets said by phone in New York
yesterday. “As developed economics implement stimulus measures,
gold will rise, fueling increase” in gold miners’ stocks
including Polyus.  Gold has climbed 0.5 percent this year, and  Danske Bank
A/S (DANSKE) , Credit Suisse Group AG and  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  forecast record
average prices for gold this year.  Output Target  Polyus reiterated its 2012 production target of 1.6 million
ounces in October, even after third-quarter sales fell 3
percent.  Shares of the company may fall as low as 179.75 pence in
London “within one week to one month” before it rebounds,
Philippe Delabarre, analyst at Trading Central investment
research company in Paris, said by phone yesterday.  Prokhorov’s Onexim Holdings Ltd. is looking to sell some or
all of its 37.8 percent stake in Polyus, according to a Sept. 12
statement. Billionaire Suleiman Kerimov’s Nafta Moskva, which
holds 40.2 percent of Polyus, said at the time it isn’t planning
to acquire shares.  The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the biggest U.S.-traded
exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, declined 0.8
percent to $29.9 yesterday, falling for the second time in three
days. The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings
in the index futures, dropped 2.9 percent to 20.48.  Urals Drops  Oil, which along with natural gas contributes about 50
percent of Russian government revenue, slipped 0.9 percent to
$93.28 a barrel in New York yesterday, declining from the
highest level in four months above the 100-day average.  Brent oil for February settlement decreased 1.4 percent to
$110.3 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
yesterday.  Urals crude , Russia’s chief export blend, retreated
1.1 percent to $108.76.  The ruble weakened 0.3 percent to 30.3475 per dollar
yesterday. It rallied 0.4 percent to 40.2975 per euro, leaving
the ruble little changed at 34.8250 versus the  dollar-euro
basket  used by the central bank to manage the currency. Ruble
futures showed the currency weakening 0.2 percent to 30.640 per
dollar in  New York  yesterday.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 commodities
slipped 0.5 percent to 652.18 yesterday.  United Co. Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 2.6 percent to HK$4.88 in Hong Kong trading as of 11:06
a.m. local time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
