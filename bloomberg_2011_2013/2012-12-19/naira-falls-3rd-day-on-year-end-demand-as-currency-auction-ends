The naira fell for a third day,
reaching its lowest in a month, as seasonal dollar demand
increased and the  Central Bank of Nigeria  ended its foreign-
currency auctions for the year.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer weakened 0.1
percent to 158.05 per dollar as of 2:04 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. A close at this price would be its weakest
since Nov. 16. The naira has gained 2.7 percent this year, the
second-best performing currency in Africa, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  There is high dollar demand due to seasonal, year-end
imports and traveling, Jide Nwaogwugwu, a research analyst at
Lagos-based Dunn Loren Merrifield Ltd., said by phone today.
“There will be demand pressure while the CBN is not selling.”  The central bank said last week it will end dollar sales to
lenders at twice-weekly auctions today and resume on Jan. 7. The
Abuja-based regulator  sold $300 million  today, the most since an
Aug. 8 sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Nigeria ’s  inflation  rate rose for the second consecutive
month in November to 12.3 percent from 11.7 percent, the
 National Bureau of Statistics  said Dec. 17. The central bank
left its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged at 12 percent this
year to control inflation and stabilize the naira.  Yields on 10-year naira debt were unchanged at 11.88
percent, according to yesterday’s prices compiled on the
Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs
on the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January 2021 fell
one basis point to 4.13 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi declined 0.1 percent to 1.896 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
