NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) ’s utility
Florida Power & Light Co. said it’s requesting bids to build a
third natural  gas pipeline  into Florida to meet growing demand
from power generators.  The approximately 700-mile (1,125-kilometer) pipeline would
deliver gas from western Alabama to a new hub in Central Florida
that would connect to FPL’s gas system in Martin County, the
Juno Beach, Florida-based company said today in a statement. The
line would deliver about 400 million cubic feet of gas a day
starting in 2017, and would increase after that, the company
said.  Bids for the project, which will consist of two segments,
are due by April 3, 2013, Richard Gibbs, a spokesman for FPL,
said today in a telephone interview. The “multibillion dollar”
pipeline will need federal, state and local approvals, Gibbs
said.  Florida uses more natural gas to produce electricity than
any U.S. state other than Texas and 60 percent of the state’s
power is generated by gas plants, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
