Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean- Claude Juncker said he has “reasons to believe” Dutch Finance
Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem could be his successor as head of
the group of 17 euro-area finance ministers.  “I have reasons to believe that the Dutch finance minister
could become chairman of the eurogroup,” Juncker said in an
interview with Luxembourg radio 100.7 today. He said he expects
to request nominations by early January and “that there will
only be one candidacy.”  Juncker, who was appointed to a new 30-month term as
eurogroup head in July, said earlier this month that he will
step down from that role by the end of January. Juncker has led
meetings of the euro-area finance ministers since 2005.  “The news that’s been repeated that leaders of the euro
area came to an agreement at the last summit” last week in
Brussels “is wrong,” Juncker said in the interview. “I don’t
exclude -- not at all -- that my Dutch colleague will take over
this role, but there’s been no agreement on this and there was
no discussion among the 17 on this either.”  Juncker said in the interview that he is in regular contact
with EU President  Herman Van Rompuy , who like Juncker, consults
other government leaders.  “I expect that after some more talks with  Van Rompuy , early
January I will ask my colleagues to submit candidacies on which
we will vote at the eurogroup meeting in January,” said Juncker.
“I expect that there will be one candidacy only.”  The euro-area finance ministers are scheduled to meet on
Jan. 21 in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
