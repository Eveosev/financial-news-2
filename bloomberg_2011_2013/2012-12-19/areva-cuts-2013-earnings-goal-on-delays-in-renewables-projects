Areva SA (AREVA) , the French maker of
nuclear reactors, offshore  wind turbines  and biomass plants, cut
its earnings forecast for 2013, citing financing delays at
unspecified renewable energy projects carried out by clients.  Revenue from the renewables division, which was forecast to
exceed 750 million euros ($994 million) in 2013, is now expected
at about 600 million euros, unchanged from 2012, Paris-based
Areva said in a statement today. As a result, earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization will exceed 1.1
billion euros in 2013, down from a previous forecast of at least
1.25 billion euros, the company said.  The reduction in the revenue forecast is “due to the time
required to set up financing for certain customer projects,
delaying their execution,” Areva said.  The French company, which is cutting spending and selling
assets to shore up a balance sheet that has been impaired by
construction delays at a nuclear plant in  Finland  and
investments in African uranium mines that have soured,
maintained its 2012 financial targets.  It also reiterated its goal for “break-even free operating
cash flow before tax” in 2013, and for revenue growth of 3
percent to 6 percent in its nuclear business next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
