permits rose to their highest price in eight days.  Allowances for delivery in December next year gained as
much as 6.5 percent to 7.38 euros ($9.79) a metric ton, the
highest price since Dec. 11, and traded at 7.25 euros as of 4:29
p.m. on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  The contract has lost 9 percent this year as a glut of
permits grew amid the economic crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
