Japan ’s exports fell for a sixth
month in November and the  trade deficit  swelled, underscoring
the challenge that incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faces in
reviving growth.  Shipments slid 4.1 percent from a year earlier, the  Finance
Ministry   said  in Tokyo today. The median forecast of 23
economists was for a 5.5 percent decline. Imports rose 0.8
percent leaving a deficit of 953.4 billion yen ($11.3 billion),
the third-largest on record.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose above 10,000 for the
first time since April on speculation that the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
will expand monetary stimulus, a move that could aid exports by
fueling more declines in the yen. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank
of America Merrill Lynch forecast that that the central bank
will add 10 trillion yen to an asset-purchase fund at a policy
meeting that ends tomorrow.  “We’re in a manufacturing-led recession,” said  Takuji Okubo , Tokyo-based chief economist at Japan Macro Advisors,
formerly of Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale SA. “While Abe
should be able to help exporters by pushing monetary easing to
weaken the yen, he may find it difficult to implement an
effective fiscal stimulus package given Japan’s mounting debt.”  The Nikkei 225 rose 1.1 percent as of 11:18 a.m. in Tokyo.
The yen was down 0.1 percent against the dollar at 84.31, close
to a 20-month low, a slide that may improve the outlook for
shipments next year.  Economic Contraction  Japan’s economy has contracted for two straight quarters,
meeting the textbook definition of a recession. Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief Japan economist at Credit Suisse Group AG in
 Tokyo , estimates that gross domestic product this quarter will
fall an annualized 3.6 percent after dropping 3.5 percent in the
three months through September.  The cumulative trade deficit for the first 11 months of
2012 was 6.28 trillion yen, more than double the record deficit
in 1980. Exports to the U.S. exceeded those to  China  for the
first time since December 2008, excluding seasonal factors, the
ministry said.  Exports to China fell 14.5 percent from the previous year
as shipments of construction equipment tumbled almost 75 percent
and cars dropped 68 percent by value, improving from an 84
percent decline in October. Exports to the European Union
dropped 19.9 percent, while those to the U.S. rose 5.3 percent.  Increasing purchases of mobile phones from Korea and China
accounted for some of the rise in imports, the ministry said.  Abe told BOJ Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa  yesterday that he
campaigned on ending deflation and correcting the strong yen,
and said that he wanted to introduce a 2 percent inflation
target.  2013 Improvement  “The improvement of overseas economies will cause a pickup
in exports in the second half of 2013,”  Junko Nishioka , chief
economist at RBS Securities Japan Ltd., said before the report.
At the same time, “the trade deficit will probably not shrink
much, as the weaker yen will raise the cost of energy imports.”  Analysts’ median estimate was for a trade deficit of 1.04
trillion yen on weakness in exports to  Europe  and China and
nuclear plant shutdowns that increased demand for energy
imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
