Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s biggest government-owned bank, is closing its global
strategic equity solutions unit as it focuses on more profitable
business.  The operation will be “managed down in an orderly
fashion,” spokeswoman Sarah Small said by telephone from London
today.  The department provided equity financing and derivative
products for sovereign wealth funds and family offices that
allowed their clients to hedge against market risks and acquire
or dispose of company shareholdings, RBS said on its website.
The unit had employees in London,  Hong Kong ,  Singapore , Dubai
and  New York , according to the  website.   About 12 people will be effected globally by the closure
and RBS may find jobs for them in other departments at the
Edinburgh-based lender, a person with knowledge of the situation
said. The decision to close the department was made in
September, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity
because the details are private.  RBS, which is reversing a decade of expansion to 2008 as
regulators impose higher  capital requirements  and as the
sovereign debt crisis erodes profitability, said in January that
it will cut about 3,500 jobs at the investment bank. The company
had 142,800 employees as of June 30 this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Didier Huyberechts, head of the Strategy Equity Solutions
department in Dubai left the bank at the end of October, he said
by telephone. Tori de Silva, a Dubai-based spokeswoman for RBS,
confirmed Huyberechts departure from the bank by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
