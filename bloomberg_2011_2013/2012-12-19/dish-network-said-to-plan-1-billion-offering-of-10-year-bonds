Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  raised $1.5
billion in a sale of 10-year bonds after increasing the size of
the offering by 50 percent.  The 5 percent notes from the Dish DBS Corp. unit of the
second-largest U.S. satellite-television provider yield 319
basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The deal was marketed earlier today
at $1 billion. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes that
may include spectrum deals, the Englewood, Colorado-based
company said today in a regulatory filing.  “Given the risk that DISH DBS will see leverage soar in
support of a wireless initiative at parent DISH Network, we
would only be interested in DISH DBS bonds if they priced more
like a BB credit, or north of +350 basis points,” Michael Hodel, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., wrote in a research note
today.  Dish previously sold debt in September, including $2
billion of 5.875 percent, 10-year debentures, Bloomberg data
show. Those notes traded at 111 cents on the dollar yesterday,
the highest since they were issued, to yield 4.45 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Deutsche Bank AG managed today’s sale, Bloomberg data show.
The bonds are rated Ba2, two levels below investment grade, by
Moody’s Investors Service, and one step lower at BB- at  Standard
& Poor’s .  DirecTV is the largest satellite-TV provider.  To contact the reporter on this story:
