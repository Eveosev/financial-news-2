Mexico  economists expect consumer
prices to rise 4.0 percent this year, according to a central
bank survey published today.  The analysts forecast the economy will expand 3.87 percent
in 2012, the survey on the central bank’s website showed. While
the bank usually publishes its surveys at the start of each
month, today’s poll was published two weeks early and reflects
forecasts from the first half of December.  Inflation expectations for 2012 fell to 4.10 percent from
4.16 percent in the previous survey after effects of a bird-flu
outbreak on egg and poultry prices eased. Price-growth has
remained above the central bank’s 2 percent to 4 percent target
range every month since June, although the central bank
forecasts it will end the year below 4 percent.  Annual inflation reached a less-than-expected 4.18 percent
in November, down from 4.6 percent in October and 4.77 percent
in September.  Mexico’s economy grew 3.3 percent in the third quarter, the
slowest pace in more than a year, as manufacturing cooled on
lower demand from the U.S. The Finance Ministry forecasts growth
this year at 3.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
