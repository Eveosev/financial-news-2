Professional golfer  Phil Mickelson 
has withdrawn his ownership interest in Major League Baseball’s
San Diego Padres, a spokesman for the golfer said.  Mickelson, 42, said yesterday that he wasn’t able to make a
long-term commitment to the team, which was recently purchased
for $800 million by a group including beer distributor Ron Fowler and the family of former Los Angeles Dodgers owner  Peter O’Malley , the San Diego Union-Tribune reported.  T.R. Reinman, a spokesman for Mickelson, confirmed the
report in an e-mail. He declined to comment on Mickelson’s
reason for the decision.  Mickelson, a San Diego resident who ranks ninth in U.S. PGA
Tour history with 40 wins, was to hold a minority stake in the
team.  To contact the reporter on this story:
