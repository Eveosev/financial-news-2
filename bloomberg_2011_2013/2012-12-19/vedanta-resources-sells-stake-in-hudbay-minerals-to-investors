Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , an Indian oil
and metals producer, sold its stake in HudBay Minerals Inc.  “Vedanta sold its total share position of approx 15
million shares to a diverse collection of institutional
shareholders,” HudBay Chief Executive Officer David Garofalo
said in an e-mail today.  Vedanta said in 2009 that a subsidiary controlled 9.5
percent of Toronto-based HudBay, a miner of zinc, copper, gold
and silver, as closely held Vedanta sought to expand in North
America.  E-mails sent to London-based Vedanta’s corporate
communications office weren’t immediately returned.  HudBay fell 4.8 percent to C$9.87 in Toronto. The shares
have slumped 2.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
