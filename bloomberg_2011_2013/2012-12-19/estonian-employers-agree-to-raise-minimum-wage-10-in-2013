Estonian employers accepted a demand
by labor unions to raise the minimum monthly wage by 10 percent
starting in January.  The minimum gross wage will increase to 320 euros ($424)
from 290 euros, according to an e-mailed statement today from
the  Estonian Employers’ Confederation .  Unions demanded the wage increase last month, citing tax
avoidance and a widening income gap between the rich and the
poor. Wages may rise too fast and trigger an upsurge in prices
because of a shortage of workers that’s “become an increasingly
important limiting factor for production,” the central bank
said last week.  Wages in the newest euro-area member may grow 5.6 percent
this year and 5.8 percent in 2013, while productivity per worker
will probably advance 0.4 percent and 2.5 percent, according to
the central bank.  Unemployment declined to a 3 1/2-year low of 9.7 percent in
the third quarter, down from a record 19.8 percent in the first
quarter of 2010. Still, economic growth will slow this year to
2.9 percent from the European Union’s fastest pace of 8.3
percent last year as Nordic export demand stalls, according to
the central bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
