The Boston  Red Sox  signed pitcher
Ryan Dempster to a two-year contract, adding an All-Star right-
hander.  Dempster, 35, split last season with the Texas Rangers and
 Chicago Cubs , compiling 12 wins and 8 losses with a 3.88 earned-
run average in 28 starts.  Financial terms of the contract werenâ€™t disclosed by the
Red Sox in a press release. The Boston Globe, without citing the
source of its information, last week reported it to be worth
$26.5 million.  A two-time All Star, Dempster has a career record of
124-124 with a 4.33 ERA in 547 games, including 322 starts, over
15 seasons with the Florida Marlins,  Cincinnati Reds , Cubs and
Rangers. While with Chicago, Dempster had 87 saves over four
seasons as a relief pitcher before returning to a starting role.  To contact the reporter on this story:
