Temperatures in the eastern U.S. may
be seasonal as December ends, with frigid air confined to the
western half of the country, said Matt Rogers, president of
Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Temperatures in parts of  Idaho , Utah and Nevada may drop as
much as 8 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 Celsius) below normal, while
the states east of the Mississippi River remain closer to
average from Dec. 29 to Jan. 2, he said.  “Storms next week and the week after are complicating the
forecast picture and keeping detail confidence on the low
side,” Rogers said in a note to clients today.  Energy traders look to long-range forecasts to gauge
potential fuel use. Below-normal temperatures in the large
cities of the Midwest and Northeast may increase demand for
energy to warm homes and businesses, pushing up natural gas and
heating oil prices.  Earlier this week, Rogers said the eastern U.S. may be
about 3 degrees cooler than normal Dec. 28 to Jan. 1. He said
today that like many other colder patterns predicted by forecast
models, this one will probably “under-perform expectations and
be less impressive.”  While the East has seasonal temperatures at the beginning
of the year, Ontario,  Quebec  and the Canadian Maritimes may have
temperatures 3 to 8 degrees above normal.  In New York, the normal average temperature for Dec. 25 is
about 36 degrees, according to MDA Weather Services in
Gaithersburg,  Maryland . It is 32 in  Boston ; 25 in Chicago; 32 in
St. Louis; 53 in Houston; 19 in Calgary,  Alberta ; 35 in Seattle;
and 49 in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
