Chinese port operators agreed to buy
a $135 million stake in a Taiwanese container terminal, the
second-biggest mainland acquisition on the island, as closer
cross-strait ties spur trade volumes.  China Merchants Holdings International Ltd. (144) ,  Cosco Pacific
Ltd. (1199)  and China Shipping Group Co. will each buy 10 percent of
the terminal in Kaohsiung,  Taiwan ’s biggest port, according to a
statement yesterday. Taiwanese shipping line  Yang Ming Marine
Transport Corp. (2609)  will remain the largest shareholder following
the transaction, which still needs regulatory approvals.  Talks on the deal began at least three years ago as Taiwan
eased restrictions on mainland investments amid warmer ties.
 China Mobile Ltd. (941)  bought a NT$17.8 billion ($613 million) stake
in mobile phone operator Far EasTone Telecommunications Co. two
years ago in the largest mainland-Taiwan acquisition, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The first phase of the Kao Ming terminal opened January,
2011, according to the statement. The facility handled 1.08
million containers in its first year, compared with a 1.4
million design capacity. Two more berths, which will double the
terminal’s capacity, are due to open in 2014. The terminal is
the only facility at Kaohsiung able to handle vessels with a
capacity of more than 14,000 containers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
