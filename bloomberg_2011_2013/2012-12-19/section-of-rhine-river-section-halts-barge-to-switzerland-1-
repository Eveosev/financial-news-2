A section of the Rhine River in
 Germany  has been shut after water levels increased, cutting off
barge shipments to  Switzerland  from the Rotterdam trading hub.  Europe’s busiest inland waterway closed late yesterday
between Germersheim and Iffezheim, Thomas May, an official at
the Wasserschutzpolizei, said today by phone from Karlsruhe,
where the 310,000 barrel-a-day Miro refinery is located. That
part of the river is used to transport commodities including
coal, scrap metal and oil products. Water levels are forecast to
continue to rise, May said.  At Kaub, 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of  Frankfurt , the
barge clearance level was 5.19 meters as of 1:34 p.m. local
time, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. That was the highest
since January 2011. Rhine water level in Rheinfelden, Germany,
near the Swiss border rose to 7.54 meters yesterday, the highest
since June 14.  “The high water levels of the Rhine will slow barge
shipments out of Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp and should lead to
heating oil starting to pile up,”  Olivier Jakob , managing
director of Switzerland-based researcher Petromatrix GmbH, said
in a note today.  Germany is Europe’s largest heating oil market. Barges of
the fuel traded at  discounts  of $2 to $4 a ton to January gasoil
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
