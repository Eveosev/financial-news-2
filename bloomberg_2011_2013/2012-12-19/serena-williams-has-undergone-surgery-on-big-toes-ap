Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion
 Serena Williams  pulled out of an exhibition event in Thailand
later this month after having surgery on her big toes, the
Associated Press reported.  The AP cited Florida podiatrist Jeffrey Rockefeller as
saying the double Olympic champion from the U.S. was treated for
a “chronic foot disorder which involved minor procedures” on
her big toes.  The third-ranked Williams had been scheduled to play top-
ranked  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus on Dec. 29 in Hua Hin,
Thailand.  Williams, 31, was sidelined for a year because of foot
surgery and a blood clot in a lung after winning Wimbledon in
2010.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
