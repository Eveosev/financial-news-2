Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  may climb about 7 percent in the next six months to
levels last seen in July as technical patterns indicate a buy
signal, according to Huawen Futures Co.  Tom DeMark’s Sequential indicator, designed to identify
trend exhaustions and anticipate reversals, gave a buy signal on
Dec. 14, when prices rose 2.8 percent, and now targets 4,100
($658) yuan a metric ton in June, said analyst Wang Yaoyao.  The most-active contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
rose to 3,841 yuan yesterday, the highest since July 19, on
speculation that an increase in lending in  China , the biggest
user, will boost demand for the product used to strengthen
concrete in building construction. Futures traded at 3,818  yuan 
a ton at 10:15 a.m. in Shanghai.  “We’re seeing the uptrend in early December continuing,
with the first target level at 3,918 yuan and then 4,100 yuan,”
Wang said.  Technical analysts observe price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting price increases, and
support levels, or floors limiting declines. The trading
patterns and prices are used to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
