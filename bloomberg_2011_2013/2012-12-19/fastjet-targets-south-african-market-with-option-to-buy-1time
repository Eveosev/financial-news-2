  FastJet Plc (FJET) , the African low-cost
airline venture, said it has acquired the option to buy South
 Africa ’s 1time Airline in a move that could expand its
operations to one of the continent’s largest aviation markets.  FastJet would buy the bankrupt South African airline from
parent 1time Holding Ltd. for $0.12, the London-based carrier
said in a statement today. 1time operations under the FastJet
brand would begin next year if the option is exercised, it said.  FastJet commenced service three weeks ago with flights in
Tanzania and has ambitions to build a network across the African
continent using a fleet of Airbus SAS A319s. The company is
backed by Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the founder of  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) , and
is majority owned by mining and agricultural group  Lonrho Plc. (LONR)   “The acquisition of 1time supports FastJet’s growth into a
pan-African low cost carrier and the synergies with FastJet’ s
existing operations will potentially increase the number of
available route networks from South Africa into the rest of
Africa,” FastJet Chief Executive Officer Ed Winter said.  Initial service would span domestic South African routes
involving Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth and
East London, FastJet said.  FastJet plans to take over some of MD80-type aircraft that
made up the 1time fleet at the time the airline went bust last
month. The aircraft will be replaced by A319s, Winter said.  Approval from regulators is required, as well as a court-
sanctioned settlement with 1time creditors, FastJet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
