Bank of America Corp.  Chief
Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  blocked a proposal to cut
the main component of most brokers’ pay as part of a new bonus
plan, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.  The proposal would have reduced the so-called grid payout
for Merrill Lynch financial advisers by two percentage points,
the person said, requesting anonymity because that plan wasn’t
made public. The changes would have affected advisers generating
less than $1 million in commissions.  Bank of America, the second-biggest U.S. lender, proceeded
with the plan to introduce new bonuses for advisers who steer
clients to use more of the bank’s products. In the weeks before
that incentive was unveiled internally this month, Moynihan
decided not to fund it by changing the grid, the person said.  David Walker , a Bank of America spokesman, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
