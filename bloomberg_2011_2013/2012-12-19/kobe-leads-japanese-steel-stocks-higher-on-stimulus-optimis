Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406) , Japan’s third-
largest mill, led domestic steelmakers higher in  Tokyo  trading
on optimism the new administration’s economy-boosting measures
will fuel demand.  Kobe Steel surged the most in 21 months, gaining 13.2
percent to 103 yen at the close.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal
Corp. (5401) , Japan’s biggest steelmaker, gained 6.7 percent to 208 yen,
the most since Sept. 7, while  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411)  rose 5 percent
to 1,520 yen.  Shinzo Abe’s victory in Japanese elections gives him a
mandate to implement fiscal and monetary stimulus plans and
increase public-works spending. Abe, whose Liberal Democratic
Party returned to power after three years, said on Dec. 17 he
wants to implement a “large” supplementary budget to stimulate
the economy.  Shares in Japanese steel companies gained today on
speculation about the stimulus measures, said  Yoku Ihara , an
investment adviser at Retela Crea Securities Co. in Tokyo. The
Japan Iron and Steel Federation Chairman Hiroshi Tomono
yesterday called on the new administration to upgrade the
country’s infrastructure and spur the nation’s economy.  To contact the reporters on this story:
