OAO RusHydro (RSHYY) ,  Russia ’s state-run
hydropower producer, is seeking to exceed a government target
for shareholder payouts in the next five years, more than
tripling dividend yields that are among the lowest of its peers.  “We expect a steady growth in dividends starting from
2012,” George Rizhinashvili, a deputy chairman at RusHydro,
said in a phone interview from Moscow yesterday. “Our annual
dividend payment ratio may be even higher than 25 percent of net
income,” based on Russian accounting standards, in the next
five years, he said.  RusHydro rallied 2.6 percent yesterday in New York, driving
a 1 percent jump in the  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index. (RUS14BN)  State
companies should “in most cases” pay 25 percent of profit as
dividends, Deputy Prime Minister  Arkady Dvorkovich  said in
September. RusHydro’s Moscow-listed stock has a 12-month
dividend yield of 1.1 percent, the second-lowest after  China ’s
Hubei Energy Energy Group Co. among 15 power producers with
market values of more than $1.2 billion, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Futures expiring in March on Russia’s RTS stock index
rallied 0.6 percent in U.S. trading hours to 152,200 as crude
oil, the nation’s biggest export earner, climbed for a third
day. The Bloomberg Russia-US gauge, which tracks the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S., gained to 98.66 in New York
yesterday, the highest level since Oct. 22.  ‘Differentiate Itself’  Dividends equal to 25 percent of net income would push
RusHydro’s yield to about 3.5 percent, according to Dmitry Bulgakov, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Moscow who rates the
company’s Moscow shares a buy. The Krasnoyarsk-based company,
which posted profit of 31.1 billion rubles ($1.03 billion) last
year and is the world’s fifth-biggest power producer by market
value, currently pays out about 10 percent of profit in
dividends, Bulgakov said by phone yesterday.  “RusHydro needs to differentiate itself from the rest of
the sector,” he said. “The market likes it and its logic is
simple, the higher the company’s dividends are, the lower the
risk of ineffective spending. Investors like predictability and
a promise of higher dividends gives them that.”  The dividend yield for Wuhan, China-based  Hubei Energy (000883)  was
0.6 percent over the past 12 months, while OAO EON Russia, a
power producer controlled by  Germany ’s largest utility, had a
yield of 2.3 percent. The dividend yield for  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V) ,
 Finland ’s biggest utility that has slumped 13 percent this year,
was 7 percent, the highest among the 15 electricity producers,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  ‘Very Optimistic’  American depositary receipts of RusHydro surged to $2.40 in
New York yesterday. The  stock  gained 1.8 percent to 75.09
kopecks, or 2.42 U.S. cents, in Moscow yesterday.  “The market is very optimistic on higher dividend payments
by RusHydro,” Elina Kulieva, an analyst at  Alfa Bank  who has a
buy rating on the shares, said by phone yesterday from Moscow.
“Those expectations are the main driver for the stock.”  The government’s share in RusHydro will increase to as much
as 66 percent from the current 60.5 percent, after the company
completes an additional share issue, Rizhinashvili said.
RusHydro began issuing 110 billion shares at 1 ruble each on
Dec. 19 and expects to finish the offering within 30 days,
according to a Dec. 13 regulatory filing. The government has
injected 50.2 billion rubles into the company this month in
exchange for the new shares.  Electricity prices are projected to rise between 12 percent
and 14 percent next year, helping RusHydro boost revenue,
Rizhinashvili said.  Rostelecom Rises  OAO Rostelecom (ROSYY) , Russia’s biggest fixed-line telephone
company, advanced 2.8 percent to $23.45 in New York, the highest
level since Nov. 6. Trading volume was almost three times the
daily average in the past three months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The company’s  stock  in Moscow increased 2.4
percent to 119.47 rubles, or $3.89.  Konstantin Malofeev, Rostelecom’s largest owner after the
Russian state, has urged the Moscow-based company to buy the
local unit of  Sweden ’s  Tele2 AB (TEL2B)  to form a fourth nationwide
wireless carrier.  Polyus Gold International Ltd. (PGIL)  added 1.8 percent to $3.42
in New York, the highest level since Oct. 22. The  shares 
increased 0.9 percent to 214 pence, or $3.48. The London-based
company plans to sell its assets in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan,

Russian exchange-traded fund, added 1.4 percent to $29.85, the
highest close since Sept. 18. The RTS Volatility Index, which
measures expected swings in futures, fell 2 percent to 20.03.  Crude oil for January delivery advanced 0.8 percent to
