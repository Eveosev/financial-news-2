Centrotherm Photovoltaics AG (CTN)  surged
the most in more than three weeks in  Frankfurt  as the German
maker of solar equipment won a 300-megawatt order from China.  Centrotherm rose as much as 18 percent, the biggest jump
since Nov. 27. It didn’t value the order from CECEP Solar Energy
Technology Co. for solar-cell production systems next year.  The company’s solar cell and panel manufacturing customers
are under pressure as  Europe  and the U.S. cut subsidies, adding
to a glut of devices that has already shrunk profit margins.  While the order is a “bright spot on the horizon,” it’s
“not yet a clear sign that the PV production-system market has
recovered,” Hans Autenrieth, the management board member for
sales and marketing at Centrotherm, said in a statement.  It rose 17 percent to 0.95 euro by 12:39 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
