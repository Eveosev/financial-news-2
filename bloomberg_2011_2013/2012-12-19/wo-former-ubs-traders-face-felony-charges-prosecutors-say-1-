Two former  UBS AG (UBSN)  traders face
felony charges for their alleged roles in the rigging of a key
global interest rate, the U.S. Justice Department said.  Tom Alexander William Hayes andRoger Darinwere charged
with conspiracy in a criminal complaint unsealed today, the
Justice Department said. Hayes also was charged with wire fraud
and a price-fixing violation for activity with another bank
aimed at manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate, the
department said.  “Make no mistake, for UBS traders, the manipulation of
Libor was about getting rich,” Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, the head of the Justice Department’s criminal division,
said a news conference in Washington.  UBS was ordered to pay about $1.5 billion to U.S., U.K. and
Swiss regulators for trying to rig global interest rates,
including Libor, over a six-year period. Regulators found that
traders at the Zurich-based bank made more than 2,000 requests
to its own rate submitters, traders at other banks and brokers
to manipulate rate submissions through 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
