Palm oil  declined by the most in a
week after China canceled some soybean purchases, signaling
weaker demand for vegetable oils in the world’s biggest buyer.  The contract for March delivery slid as much as 1.2 percent
to 2,313 ringgit ($758) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the biggest intraday fall since Dec. 12. The price was
at 2,318 ringgit at 12:01 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .  U.S. exporters said 420,000 tons of soybeans registered for
delivery before Sept. 1 were canceled, including 300,000 tons
bound for China, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .
Palm oil, which competes with soy, is heading for a 27 percent
drop this year, the worst annual loss since the financial crisis
in 2008, as stockpiles in  Malaysia  have climbed to a record.  “Reports of the canceled cargo from China has brought down
the prices,” Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at Commtrendz
Risk Management Services Pvt., said by phone from Mumbai.
“Pressure from the higher stockpiles still remains, although
technical indications are that prices are near the bottom.”  Stockpiles in Malaysia climbed to 2.56 million tons last
month, the nation’s palm oil board said Dec. 10. Shipments fell
3.3 percent to 734,571 tons in the first 15 days of December
from a month earlier, Societe General de Surveillance said.  Soybean oil for delivery in March was little changed at
49.58 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans
dropped 0.3 percent to $14.5575 bushel.  Palm oil for May delivery fell 1 percent to 6,742  yuan 
($1,082) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil for
May dropped 1.3 percent to 8,678 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
