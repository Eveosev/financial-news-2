Canadian  wholesale sales  rebounded
in October from the biggest drop in almost two years, led by
higher food and motor vehicle receipts, adding to evidence the
economy may have accelerated in the fourth quarter.  Sales rose 0.9 percent in October to C$49.2 billion ($49.9
billion) after a revised 1.5 percent decline in September,
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. The gain exceeded all 14
forecasts in a Bloomberg  survey , which had a median estimate of
a 0.5 percent increase.  The report adds to evidence the worldâ€™s 11th largest
economy may be rebounding after a weak third quarter. Other
reports published this month have shown greater-than-forecast
increases in employment and building permits.  Six of seven major categories tracked by the agency rose in
October,  Statistics Canada  said. Food wholesalers recorded a 1.2
percent gain in October, while wholesalers of motor vehicles
increased sales by 1 percent. Personal and household goods sales
were up 1.2 percent.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the impact of
price changes, increased 0.8 percent.  Receipts have stagnated after reaching a record C$50
billion in May. Wholesale sales were 2.2 percent higher in
October than the same month a year earlier.  Wholesaler inventories rose 0.2 percent to C$61.5 billion
in October. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how many
months it would take to deplete stocks at the current sales
pace, fell to 1.25 in October from 1.26 in September.  In a separate report, Statistics Canada said the number of
people receiving  employment insurance  benefits in October rose
0.9 percent to 535,030.  To contact the reporter on this story:
