India ’s lower house of parliament
approved a legislation that would make companies spend 2 percent
of their profit on social welfare.  Under the  Companies Bill , firms that reported an average
profit of at least 50 million rupees ($912,825) in the last
three years will have to allocate the funds. The legislation
also seeks to improve corporate governance norms, makes
boardroom decisions transparent and holds auditors and directors
more accountable.  Corporate Affairs Minister Sachin Pilot said yesterday in
the lower house that the bill encourages firms to spend on
social welfare “voluntarily.” The government intends to make
India an attractive investment destination with this
legislation, he said. The proposal requires approval from the
upper house and consent of the president before becoming law.  The new law will add momentum to Prime Minister  Manmohan
Singh ’s policy reforms amid forecasts for the slowest pace of
growth in a decade and before national elections in 2014. The
lower house yesterday also approved changes to banking laws,
raising a cap on voting rights and giving more regulatory power
to the  Reserve Bank  of India in a move that may open up the
industry to more lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
