J.C. Penney Co. (JCP)  hired a former
Abercrombie & Fitch Co. executive to help with its stores’
layout and design as Chief Executive Officer  Ron Johnson 
continues to lure alumni of the teen retailer.  Brandon Tonniges is a director of visual merchandising,
Joey Thomas, a J.C. Penney spokesman, said in an e-mail.
Tonniges was a vice president in Abercrombie’s brand senses
division, which the teen retailer’s website calls the “creative
force” behind its store experience.  Johnson is overhauling the 110-year-old department-store
company by turning most of its stores into collections of
branded shops as well as reducing sales events and coupons.
 Since (ANF)  joining as CEO last year, the former Apple Inc. retail
chief has hired ex-Abercrombie executives including Chief
Operating Officer Michael Kramer, Chief Supply Chain Officer
John Singleton and Chief Technology Officer Kristen Blum.  J.C. Penney’s sales have dropped 20 percent or more for
three straight quarters and the shares have slid 41 percent this
year. The stock rose 3.5 percent to $20.88 at the close in  New
York .  Tonniges will report to a vice president under Michael Fisher, who was named senior vice president of visual
presentation in March.  Abercrombie is one of the biggest U.S. specialty retailers
with more than 1,000 stores worldwide. Johnson also has tapped
Apple and  Target Corp. (TGT)  executives to replace managers hired
before he joined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
