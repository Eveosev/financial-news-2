IDB Holding Corp. (IDBH)  bonds rose,
sending the yield down the most in almost two weeks after a unit
of the debt-strapped company’s investment arm got a $750 million
offer to sell  New York ’s HSBC Tower.  IDB’s 5.1 percent bonds due December 2020 soared 6.5
percent to 23.31 agorot to the shekel, lowering the yield to
55.54 percent, the first decline in a week, at the close in Tel
Aviv. The company’s  shares  rose 4.8 percent as the benchmark
 TA-25 index  gained 0.8 percent. The nation’s benchmark bonds
fell, with the yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes
due in January 2022 increasing three basis points to 3.79
percent.  Property & Building Ltd. (PTBL) , which is 79.2 percent owned by
IDB’s  Discount Investment Corp. (DISI) , said today that no decision on
the offer for the building has been made. The value of the Fifth
Avenue building was raised to $580 million on March 31,
according to the  company’s third-quarter results . IDB, which is
struggling to meet payments on about 2 billion shekels ($533
million) in debt, has been in talks with debtholders to avert
insolvency proceedings. Property & Building’s  shares  surged 18
percent, the most since Nov. 2008, to 181.60 shekels.  “This is a very attractive offer for the company which
would also help support the needs of the group,” said Shay Lipman, an analyst at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage in Tel Aviv. “The
company would make a profit from the sale and have free  cash
flow  for dividends.”  Tender Tomorrow  Property & Building Corp. in June agreed to borrow $400
million for a 10-year period from a foreign institution to
refinance its debt on the tower. The yield on Property &
Building’s 5 percent bond due November 2017, fell 14 basis
points, the most since Nov. 13, to 3.797 percent. The company
will tomorrow start the institutional stage of a tender for two
new series of bonds. Moody’s Midroog rated as much as 500
million shekels of its debt A1 with a negative outlook.  The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which measures inflation-linked
and fixed-rate corporate bonds, declined for a sixth day,
retreating 0.1 percent to 279.33.  First International Bank of
Israel Ltd.  today accepted 341 million shekels in instutional
commitments in a tender for deferred notes. Demand for the notes
totaled 914 million shekels.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government debt of
similar maturity, advanced six basis points to 212,implying an
annual average rate of 2.12 percent.  One-year interest-rate
swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates over the
period, rose one basis point to 1.74 percent.  The shekel strengthened 0.3 percent to 3.7484 a dollar at
4:43 p.m., boosting this month’s advance to 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
