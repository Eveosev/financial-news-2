Conoil Plc (CONOIL)  jumped to the highest
level in four months after the Nigerian petroleum products
company said it is making new investments to expand sales.  The stock rose 5 percent to 21.52 naira by the close in
Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, its highest level since
Aug. 22.  Conoil is investing more than 500 million naira ($3.16
million) to build a capability for selling lubricant brands and
cooking gas directly to consumers, the company said in a
statement on its website on Dec. 18. The project, planned to run
for nine months, will create 500 jobs, the company said.  “The announcement has earned the company some good
patronage,” Raheem Mohammed, chief operating officer of Kundila
Finance Ltd., said by phone from Lagos today.  Conoil has fallen 32 percent this year, compared with a 32
percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
