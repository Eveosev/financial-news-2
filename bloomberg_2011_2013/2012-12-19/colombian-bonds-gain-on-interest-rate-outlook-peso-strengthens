Colombia ’s peso bonds advanced,
pushing yields lower, on speculation the central bank may reduce
 interest rates  as soon as this week to buoy growth in the South
American country.  The yield on the government’s 9.25 percent debt due in May
2014 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.89
percent, according to the central bank. The price increased
0.046 centavo to 105.712 centavos per peso. The yield on the
country’s benchmark peso bond due July 2024 fell one basis point
to 5.88 percent. Shorter-term bonds are more prone to
fluctuations in value from near-term interest-rate changes.  “Chances are rising for another cut,” Daniel Escobar, the
head analyst at Global Securities Colombia SA, a brokerage firm
in Bogota, said in a telephone interview.  Policy makers last month unexpectedly lowered the  overnight
lending rate  by a quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent to
boost a slowing economy.  Banco de la Republica will lower the benchmark by a
quarter-percentage point to 4.25 percent on Dec. 21, according
to three of 31 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest
project the target rate will hold steady.  The peso rose 0.1 percent to 1,791.65 per  U.S. dollar  today
and has rallied 8.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
