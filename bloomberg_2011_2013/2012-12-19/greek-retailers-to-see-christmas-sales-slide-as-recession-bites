Greek retailers will see Christmas
and New Year-related revenue decline 18 percent as business is
blighted by the country’s fifth year of recession, the National
Confederation of Hellenic Commerce said.  Nationwide spending on food and gifts will fall to 7.6
billion euros ($10.1 billion) this month from 9.25 billion euros
in December 2011, the Athens-based trade group said in an e-
mailed  statement  today. Expenditure will be 65 percent less than
the 21.9 billion euros recorded in the same month of 2008, at
the start of the financial crisis, the confederation said.  Greece ’s unemployment rate climbed to a record 26 percent
in September. The recession and deepening labor slump have been
exacerbated by spending cuts and tax increases imposed to trim a
budget deficit that was more than five times the euro-area limit
in 2009. The economy will shrink as much as 4.5 percent in 2013,
the  Bank of Greece (TELL)  forecast on Dec. 3.  The cost of a family Christmas dinner, based on an
identical basket of products, will fall to 151.56 euros this
year from 158.93 euros in 2011 as lower prices for red meat,
fruit and vegetables help to offset higher prices of turkey,
wine, feta cheese and olive oil, according to the statement.  Greek retail spending for the whole of 2012 probably won’t
exceed 50 billion euros, down from 60.5 billion euros in 2011,
the confederation said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
