Thales SA (HO) , Europe’s biggest defense
electronics maker, will name  Jean-Bernard Levy  as chief
executive officer to succeed Luc Vigneron, who will step down
early, according to the company’s largest private owner.  Charles Edelstenne, CEO of  Dassault Aviation SA (AM) , which
owns almost 26 percent of Thales, told journalists today on a
press trip that Levy, formerly chief of  Vivendi SA (VIV) , will be
named to the Thales job tomorrow. Dassault is the company’s top
owner after the French government.  Vigneron, formerly chief executive of state-owned tanks
maker Nexter, was tapped by the government and Dassault in 2009
amid a reshuffling of the shareholder structure in which
Alcatel-Lucent SA divested its holding and Dassault boosted its
investment.  Levy was chief executive of Vivendi for seven years until
he was ousted in June after months of tension with Jean-Rene Fourtou, the chairman since 2002. The disagreements were said to
center on Levy’s resistance to turnaround scenarios.  Messages left at Thales’s press office and calls to a
spokesman’s mobile phone weren’t immediately returned.
Vigernon’s mandate had been set to last through 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
