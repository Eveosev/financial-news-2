Malaysia’s inflation rate held at
the lowest in more than two years in November, giving the
central bank scope to keep  interest rates  steady and support
growth.  Consumer prices  rose 1.3 percent from a year earlier, after
climbing at the same pace in October, the Putrajaya-based
Statistics Department said in a statement today. The median of
18 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 1.4 percent
gain.  The  World Bank  said today most policy makers in East Asia’s
emerging nations should keep interest rates steady as economic
growth is poised to accelerate next year without spurring
inflation.  Bank Negara  Malaysia has maintained borrowing costs
at 3 percent for nine consecutive meetings and said last month
price gains are expected to remain “modest” in 2013.  “Malaysia is in a sweet spot and Bank Negara can keep the
key rate unchanged for a while,” Jackit Wong, a Hong Kong-based
economist at Natixis Asia Ltd., said before the report.
“Malaysia’s economy will likely remain solid, continuously
supported by firm domestic consumption and strong investment.”  Malaysia’s interest rates are “roughly in line” with those
suggested by the Taylor rule, the World Bank said today.  John
Taylor , an economist at  Stanford University , published in 1993
an interest-rate formula, which measures where a central bank
should set its policy rate based on inflation and growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
