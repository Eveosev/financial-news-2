Prime Minister  David Cameron  said
the U.K. will bring home 3,800 troops from  Afghanistan  next
year, almost half the current strength serving in Helmand
province, as it hands over security to local forces.  Troop numbers, which have already been reduced from 9,500
to 9,000 by the end of 2012, will fall to about 5,200 after the
end of next year, Cameron told lawmakers in London today. All
North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led operations in the country
are due to finish by the end of 2014. The U.K. remains committed
to supporting Afghanistan beyond next year.  “Because of the success of our forces and the Afghan
national security forces and the fact we are moving from
mentoring at a battalion level to mentoring at a brigade level
by the end of 2013, we will be able to see troops come home in
two relatively even steps in 2013 and 2014,” Cameron said.  Cameron discussed Afghanistan with U.S. President  Barack Obama  in an hour-long video conference yesterday, during which
they agreed that NATO’s strategy to withdraw combat troops by
the end of next year is “on track.”  “This would present further opportunities for
International Security Assistance Force countries to bring
troops home next year and they agreed to stay in close touch as
detailed plans develop,” Cameron’s office said in an e-mail.  “In terms of post-2014 we haven’t made final decisions
yet,” Cameron told the House of Commons. “We have said very
clearly: no one in a combat role, nothing like the number of
troops there are now.” The premier said the U.K. had “told the
Afghans we will provide the officer training academy they have
asked for.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
