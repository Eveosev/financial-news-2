European governments will be able
to fund faster Internet networks in cities under rules approved
by the European Commission today.  Regulators said new guidelines for funding networks with
speeds of more than 100 megabits per second would allow public
funding in urban areas “subject to very strict conditions.”  The overhaul would limit public funding for broadband
unless it provides a substantial improvement over existing
infrastructure.  To contact the reporter on this story:
