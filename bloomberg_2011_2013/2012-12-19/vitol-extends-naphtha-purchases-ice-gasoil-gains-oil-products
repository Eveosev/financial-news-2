Vitol Group extended its purchases
of naphtha in northwest  Europe , taking its number of cargoes to
22 since the start of last week. Gasoil rose for the fourth time
in five days on the ICE Futures Europe Exchange.  A section of the Rhine River, Europe’s busiest inland
waterway, in Germany has been shut after water levels increased,
cutting Switzerland off from the Rotterdam trading hub. That
part of the river is used to transport commodities including
coal, scrap metal and oil products.  Light Products  Naphtha traded from $959 to $961 a metric ton as Vitol
bought four shipments from Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Glencore
International Plc, Dow Chemical Co. and Trafigura Beheer BV,
according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Platts pricing window. That’s the most since Oct.
17 and compares with a deal at $957 yesterday.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, widened to $3.36 a
barrel at 1:50 p.m. London time, according to data from PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a crude and products broker. It was $3.01 the
previous session, the smallest spread since Jan. 31.  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area traded at
$950 and $951 a ton, according to a survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with
deals at $941 and $945 yesterday.  Chevron Corp., Trafigura and Hess Corp.’s Hetco sold the
Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make finished fuel.
Vitol and Statoil ASA bought shipments comprising 1,000 tons.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to Brent crude, fell to $4.71
a barrel as of 1:50 p.m. London time, PVM data showed. It was
$5.12 yesterday.  Gasoline demand in  France  declined 0.9 percent last month
from a year earlier, according to the Union Francaise des
Industries Petrolieres, an industry group.  Middle Distillates  Diesel barges traded at $17 more than January gasoil on
ICE, the Platts survey showed. That’s unchanged from yesterday.
North Sea Group sold to Vitol Group and Morgan Stanley.  The latter was the only buyer of jet fuel barges, acquiring
three lots from BP Plc and Vitol at premiums of $85 and $86 a
ton, the survey showed. That matches yesterday’s level, the
highest since Nov. 20, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Gasoil for January delivery rose $9.25, or 1 percent, to
$937.50 a ton on ICE as of 4:52 p.m. London time. The February
contract was at a 50 cent premium to the front month.  The futures have been in contango, where near-term supplies
are cheaper than later deliveries, for the 28th session as of
today because of milder weather. That’s the longest stretch
since August last year.  The temperature in  Frankfurt  was 5 degrees Celsius (41
degrees Fahrenheit) today, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. It
has been above the five-year average since Dec. 14.  “The ICE gasoil front spreads have not been particularly
strong recently, and the recent European weather developments
currently do not call for a change of trend,”  Olivier Jakob ,
managing director of Switzerland-based researcher Petromatrix
GmbH said today in a note.  The  fuel’s crack  gained to $15.92 a barrel versus $15.80 at
4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent rose 1 percent to $109.90 a barrel.  Diesel consumption in France rose 5.2 percent in November
from the same month last year, UFIP said today in an e-mail.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil changed hands from $575.75 to $583 a
ton, the survey of Platts showed. That compares with $573 to
$578.50 a ton yesterday. The low-sulfur grade traded at $614,
versus $610.25 to $611 yesterday.  Rhine River  At Kaub, 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Frankfurt, the
barge clearance level was 5.22 meters at 4:34 p.m. local time,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. That was the highest since
January 2011. Rhine water level in Rheinfelden,  Germany , near
the Swiss border rose to 7.54 meters yesterday, the highest
since June 14.  The waterway closed late yesterday between Germersheim and
Iffezheim, Thomas May, an official at the Wasserschutzpolizei,
said today by phone from Karlsruhe where the 310,000 barrel-a-
day Miro refinery is located. Germany is Europe’s biggest
heating oil market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
