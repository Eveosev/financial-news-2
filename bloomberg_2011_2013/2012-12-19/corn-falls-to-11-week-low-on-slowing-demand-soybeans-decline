Corn fell to the an 11-week low
after the government said production of ethanol fell and
inventories rose last week. Soybeans declined for a third time
this week as rains aid crops in  Brazil .  Production of ethanol in the U.S., mostly from corn, fell
13 percent in the week ended Dec. 14 from a year earlier, the
 Department of Energy  said in a weekly report. About 42% of this
year’s crop will be used to make ethanol, according to the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture . Stockpiles rose 4 percent last week
from a year earlier to the highest since June. Ethanol producers
are losing as much as 25 cents a gallon producing the fuel,
according to Northstar Commodity Investments Inc.  “Ethanol production is slowing and inventories are still
rising, a negative combination,”  Mark Schultz , the chief
analyst for Minneapolis-based Northstar, said in a telephone
interview.  “Corn demand is slowing.”  Corn futures for March delivery declined 1.5 percent to
$7.09 a bushel at 11:20 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
after touching $7.0575, the lowest since Sept. 28. The price
through yesterday gained 11 percent this year after drought cut
U.S. production 13 percent to a six-year low. The grain reached
a record $8.49 on Aug. 10.  Soybean futures for March delivery dropped 1.1 percent to
$14.4425 a bushel, heading for the first three-day decline since
Nov. 12. Earlier, the oilseed touched $14.4225, the lowest since
Dec. 4. Most-active futures through yesterday gained 21 percent
this year after a drought in the U.S. triggered concern that
supplies will fall short of growing demand from  China .  Rain may boost Brazilian soybean production to 81.5 million
metric tons in the marketing year that begins Feb. 1, up from
81.3 million forecast in November and 67.7 million harvested
this year, the soybean processors group Abiove said today. The
USDA predicts Brazil will surpass the U.S. as the top producer
and exporter of the crop.  Favorable Conditions  Frequent rain the next two weeks from  Paraguay  to central
Brazil will maintain favorable conditions for flowering plants,
 World Weather Inc.  said in a report today. Yesterday, U.S.
exporters said 420,000 tons of soybeans registered for delivery
before Sept. 1 were canceled, including 300,000 tons to China.  “Harvest will ramp up by the middle of January in Brazil,
and that will slow demand” for U.S. soybeans, Charles Sernatinger, a vice president at ABN Amro Clearing Inc. in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “U.S. soybeans appear
to be overpriced, and the Chinese seem to agree.”  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
