Gasoline in  Europe  rose for the
third day as Cargill Inc. bought in the barge market. Gasoil
advanced for the fourth time in five days on the ICE Futures
Europe Exchange.  A section of the Rhine River, Europe’s busiest inland
waterway, in Germany has been shut after water levels increased,
cutting  Switzerland  from the Rotterdam trading hub. That part of
the river is used to transport commodities including coal, scrap
metal and oil products.  Light Products  Gasoline in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp area traded at
$950 and $951 a metric ton, according to a survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That compares with
deals at $941 and $945 yesterday.  Chevron Corp., Trafigura Beheer BV and Hess Corp.’s Hetco
unit sold the Eurobob grade, to which ethanol is added to make
finished fuel. Vitol Group and Statoil ASA bought shipments
comprising 1,000 tons.  The fuel’s  crack , or premium to  Brent crude , fell to $4.85
a barrel as of 10:52 a.m. London time, according to data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and products broker. It was
$5.12 yesterday.  Gasoline demand in  France  declined 0.9 percent last month
from a year earlier, according to the Union Francaise des
Industries Petrolieres, an industry group.  Naphtha’s crack , or discount to Brent, widened to $3.22 a
barrel, PVM data showed. It was $3.01 the previous session, the
smallest spread since Jan. 31.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for January delivery rose $9.50, or 1 percent, to
$937.75 a ton on the ICE exchange as of 12:42 p.m. local time.
February futures were at parity to the front month.  The futures have been in contango, where near-term supplies
are cheaper than later deliveries, for 27 sessions as of
yesterday amid a milder weather. That was the longest stretch
since August last year.  The temperature in  Frankfurt  was 5 degrees Celsius (41
degrees Fahrenheit) today, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. It
has been above the five-year average since Dec. 14.  “The ICE gasoil front spreads have not been particularly
strong recently, and the recent European weather developments
currently do not call for a change of trend,”  Olivier Jakob ,
managing director of Switzerland-based researcher Petromatrix
GmbH said today in a note.  The  fuel’s crack  gained to $15.98 a barrel versus $15.80 at
4:30 p.m. yesterday. Brent rose 1 percent to $109.90 a barrel.  Diesel consumption in France rose 5.2 percent in November
from the same month last year, UFIP said today in an e-mail.  Rhine River  At Kaub, 40 miles (64 kilometers) west of Frankfurt, the
barge clearance level was 5.17 meters at 12:33 p.m. local time,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. That was the highest since
January 2011. Rhine water level in Rheinfelden, Germany, near
the Swiss border rose to 754 centimeters yesterday, the highest
since June 14.  The waterway closed late yesterday between Germersheim and
Iffezheim, Thomas May, an official at the Wasserschutzpolizei,
said today by phone from Karlsruhe where the 310,000 barrel-a-
day Miro refinery is located.  Germany  is Europe’s biggest
heating oil market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
