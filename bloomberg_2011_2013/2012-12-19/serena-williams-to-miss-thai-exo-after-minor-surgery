Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion
 Serena Williams  dropped out of an exhibition event scheduled for
this month in Thailand after having surgery on her toes.  The operation was “very minor” and won’t affect her
preparations for the new tennis season, her agent, Jill Smoller,
said in an e-mail today.  The Australian Open, the season’s first major championship,
starts Jan. 14 in Melbourne.  The third-ranked Williams had been scheduled to play top-
ranked  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus on Dec. 29 in Hua Hin,
Thailand.  Williams, 31, was sidelined for a year because of foot
surgery and a blood clot after winning Wimbledon in 2010. She
has won 15 Grand Slam singles titles, sixth most among women.  To contact the reporter on this story:
