President  Barack Obama  said he
offered congressional Republicans a “fair deal” during budget
talks and accused them of “posturing” in negotiations.  The president, at a White House news conference, vowed to
continue to reach out to House Speaker  John Boehner  and said
there is no reason to breach the end-of-the-year deadline and
allow automatic spending cuts and tax increases to take effect.  “I have gone at least half way” in negotiations for a
accord to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff and Republicans need
to “take the deal” he’s offered, Obama said. “The fact that
they haven’t taken it yet is puzzling.”  Obama also said he still wants to get an agreement by
Christmas. He said the proposals he and Boehner have advanced
are “pretty close.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
