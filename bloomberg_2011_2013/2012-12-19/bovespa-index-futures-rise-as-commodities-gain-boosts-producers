The  Bovespa (IBOV)  index advanced for a
second day as  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  rallied after Finance
Minister Guido Mantega said the state-run producer will raise
gasoline prices.  Petrobras contributed the most to the gauge’s advance after
Mantega, who is also the company’s chairman, said today in
Brasilia that there will “certainly” be a price increase in
2013. Homebuilder PDG Realty SA Empreendimentos & Participacoes
rose the most in almost two weeks amid speculation a stronger
global economy will support Brazil’s recovery.  The Bovespa climbed 0.9 percent to 60,998.34 at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo, extending its increase in 2012 to 7.5
percent. Forty stocks rose on the gauge today while 26 sank. The
real strengthened 0.8 percent to 2.0718 per dollar.  “A price increase is key for Petrobras to carry on with
its huge investment plan,” said Roberto Altenhofen, an analyst
at Sao Paulo-based consulting firm Empiricus Research.  The Rio de Janeiro-based producer said in a regulatory
filing today it plans to cut operating costs by 32 billion reais
between 2013 and 2016 as it ramps up offshore crude reserve
investments. Petrobras plans to invest $236 billion between 2012
and 2016, mostly on exploration and production. The stock, the
heaviest- weighted  on the Bovespa after  Vale SA (VALE) , rose 3.8 percent
to 20.93 reais.  U.S. stocks fell as political leaders in  Washington  tried
to reach a budget deal. The $607 billion in spending cuts and
tax increases set to take effect next year without an agreement
may lead to a recession and a higher jobless rate, the
Congressional Budget Office has said.  Recovery Prospects  “There are more signs that the U.S. will soon have a
solution for the so-called fiscal cliff, and once that happens,
the road to recovery will be pretty much open over there,”
Hamilton Moreira, a strategist at  Banco do Brasil SA , said by
phone from Sao Paulo. “Things for the global economy should be
better next year, and with  Brazil ’s trading partners growing at
a faster pace, Brazil itself will probably follow suit.”  PDG Realty jumped 2.5 percent to 3.27 reais.  Vale, the world’s largest iron-ore producer, fell for the
first time in nine days, dropping 1.2 percent to 40.51 reais
after it agreed to pay 212 million Swiss francs ($233 million)
to settle a tax dispute with Switzerland.  The Bovespa index has climbed 16 percent from this year’s
low in June as stimulus from central banks around the world
eased concern about an economic slowdown while record low
benchmark lending rates have pushed some investors to move into
stocks from fixed income.  The index  trades  at 11.3 times analysts’ earnings estimates
for the next four quarters, compared with 11.1 times for MSCI
Inc.’s measure of 21 developing nations’ equities, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Trading volume was 8.52 billion reais in stocks in Sao
Paulo today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.28 billion reais this year
through Dec. 17, according to data compiled by the  exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
