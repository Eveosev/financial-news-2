Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Latin
America’s largest oil producer by market value, paid $234
million to acquire a fertilizer plant from  Vale SA. (VALE5)   The 700,000 metric tons Araucaria Nitrogenados urea plant
“complements the other Petrobras fertilizer assets,” Rio de
Janeiro-based Petrobras said in a statement yesterday. The deal
needs regulatory approval, it said.  The acquisition comes after Petrobras reported a 12 percent
drop in third-quarter profit and its first quarterly loss in 13
years in the second-quarter. Vale, the world’s  largest iron-ore
producer , is cutting investments, suspending projects and
selling assets as demand wanes in China and Europe, the
company’s two biggest markets.  Vale expects to announce the sale of some of its oil and
gas assets in the coming weeks, Chief Executive Officer Murilo Ferreira told reporters in  London  after an investors’
presentation on Dec. 6. The company will likely announce the
sale of a stake in its general cargo VLI unit in the first two
months of 2013, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
