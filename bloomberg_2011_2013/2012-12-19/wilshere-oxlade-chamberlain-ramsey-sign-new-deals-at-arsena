England midfielder  Jack Wilshere  is
among five Arsenal players who have signed new “long-term”
contracts.  Fellow international players Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain,
Kieran Gibbs, Carl Jenkinson and Aaron Ramsey have also agreed
on new deals.  “We are delighted that these five young players have all
signed new long-term contracts,” manager  Arsene Wenger  told the
club  website . Arsenal didn’t reveal the length of the contracts.  Between them the five have made more than 350 first-team
appearances for the Gunners.  England forward Theo Walcott has yet to commit himself to
Arsenal and there is speculation he may leave. His contract
expires at the end of this season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
