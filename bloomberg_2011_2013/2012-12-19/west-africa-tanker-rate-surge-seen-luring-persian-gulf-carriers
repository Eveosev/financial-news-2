A surge in oil-tanker rates for
vessels shipping West African crude to the U.S. may restrict
ship supply in the  Persian Gulf  as the rally lures vessels to
the Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Securities ASA said.  Earnings rose almost threefold to $23,314 a day this month
for ships hauling 1 million-barrel cargoes of West African oil
to the U.S., according to data from the  Baltic Exchange  in
London. Very large crude carriers with twice the capacity are
making $17,253 shipping Persian Gulf oil to  Japan , the bourse’s
data show.  The price rally from West Africa may cause owners to send
VLCCs in ballast to the region after the ships deliver cargoes
to Asia, Arctic analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth said in an e-
mailed note today. That would limit how many are available in
the Persian Gulf, the normal return destination, he said.
Ballasting normally refers to sailing with sea water to keep a
ship stable when it doesn’t have a cargo.  The Baltic Dirty Tanker Index, an overall measure of crude
oil transportation costs, climbed 2.7 percent yesterday to 774
points, its largest one-day gain since March 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
