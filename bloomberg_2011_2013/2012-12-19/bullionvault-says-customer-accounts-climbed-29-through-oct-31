BullionVault, an online service to
buy, sell and store gold and silver, said the number of funded
customer accounts climbed 29 percent in its latest year.  There were 42,677 accounts as of Oct. 31, BullionVault said
in an e-mailed statement today. Gold held by customers climbed
to 31.28 metric tons from 26.3 tons a year earlier and silver
assets rose to 332.8 tons from 244.8 tons, Adrian Ash, the
company’s head of research, said by phone today.  Revenue still fell 32 percent to 380 million pounds ($618
million) because prices weren’t as volatile, discouraging
trading, Ash said. “If the price isn’t moving as much, then
people aren’t going to be in and out as much,” he said. “The
nature of the market has been one of consolidation across the
board.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
