Oil rose to a two-month high after
the Energy Department said inventories decreased as  refineries
ramped up  operations, boosting demand for crude.  Prices gained for a fourth day as  stockpiles  fell to 371.6
million barrels, the least since Oct. 12, and refineries ran the
most since August. Petroleum consumption rose to the second-
highest level this year and demand for distillate fuels
including heating oil and diesel increased to the greatest
amount in 2012.  “Crude oil runs are strong and that’s bullish,” said
 Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group Inc. in Villanova,
 Pennsylvania . “Crude demand is higher due to the refinery runs.
The product markets are very strong.”  Crude oil for January delivery rose $1.58, or 1.8 percent,
to settle at $89.51 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The four-day streak of gains is the longest since
September. January futures expired at the close of floor trading
today. The more-active February contract advanced $1.58, or 1.8
percent, to $89.98.  Brent for February settlement increased $1.52, or 1.4
percent, to $110.36 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. Brent’s premium to February WTI narrowed by 6
cents to $20.38 a barrel.  WTI has declined 9.4 percent in 2012 as a U.S. shale boom
deepened the  glut  at Cushing,  Oklahoma , America’s biggest
storage hub. That has left it at an average $17.40 below Brent
this year, compared with a premium of about 95 cents in the 10
years through 2010. Brent, the benchmark grade for more than
half the world’s crude, has risen 2.8 percent this year.  Refinery Rates  The 964,000-barrel decline in crude  supplies  was less than
the forecast decrease of 1.75 million that was the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 11 analysts. Refineries
operated at a 91.5 percent rate, up 1.1 percentage points from
the previous week and the most since Aug. 10.  “The 91 percent utilization rate leads to stronger demand
for crude oil,” said  John Kilduff , a partner at Again Capital
LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. “There
is some concern about further destocking for those crude
inventories into the end of the year.”  Oil stockpiles have dropped during December in the past six
years, Energy Department data show. Companies in  Texas  can be
taxed on the value of stored crude as part of local property
taxes, R.J. DeSilva, an Austin-based spokesman for the Texas
Comptroller of Public Accounts, said in an e-mail.  Product Supplies  The Energy Department also said  inventories of distillates 
dropped 1.09 million barrels to 117 million. They were forecast
to rise 1 million.  Gasoline supplies  gained 2.21 million barrels
to 219.3 million, more than the 2 million increase expected by
analysts.  Total consumption of fuels  jumped 1.13 million barrels a
day, or 6 percent, to 20 million, the most since Aug. 10.
Distillate demand surged 20 percent to 4.21 million barrels a
day, the most since Dec. 16, 2011.  “The report is bullish for the market,” said Bill Baruch,
a senior market strategist at Iitrader.com in  Chicago . “Demand
is stronger, especially distillates, and oil is building its
momentum.”  Investors also watched the budget talks in  Washington . More
than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases, known as
the fiscal cliff, is set to start in the U.S. in January unless
an agreement to avert the measures is reached.  “There is a more optimistic tone in the budget talks,”
said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition
Energy in Stamford,  Connecticut . “It won’t surprise me to see
oil move up to the $90 area.”  Plan B  The House may vote tomorrow on House Speaker  John Boehner ’s
“Plan B,” which would raise tax rates on income over $1
million, rather than the $400,000 threshold that President
 Barack Obama  proposed in his latest offer. Obama said he would
veto Plan B.  The president said today at the White House that he would
“like to get it done before Christmas.”  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 454,945
contracts as of 3:30 p.m. Volume totaled 439,704 contracts on
Dec. 14, 14 percent below the three-month average. Open interest
was 1.49 million, the least since Nov. 19.  To contact the reporters on this story:
