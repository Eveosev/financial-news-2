Steel reinforcement-bar futures
dropped from the highest level in five months on speculation
that growth in demand for the construction raw material will
slow as  China  maintains curbs on the  property market .  Rebar for delivery in May fell as much as 0.6 percent to
3,796  yuan  ($609) per metric ton on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange and was at 3,806 yuan by the end of the morning session.
Futures, down 9.6 percent this year, closed at 3,819 yuan
yesterday, the highest price since July 19.  China will stick to its real estate curbs, Liao Yonglin, an
official from the Ministry of Land and Resources, said yesterday.
In its more than two-year effort to rein in prices, China raised
down-payment and mortgage requirements, imposed a property tax
for the first time in Shanghai and Chongqing, and placed home-
purchase restrictions in about 40 cities.  “The level of construction activities in the housing
market is rather lackluster,” Long Qingqing, analyst at Huatai
Great Wall Futures Co., said by phone from  Shanghai .  The country’s new property starts fell 7.2 percent in the
first 11 months from last year to 1.62 billion square meters
(17.4 billion square feet), according to statistics bureau data.  The  average spot price  of rebar rose 0.6 percent to 3,624
yuan a ton yesterday, the highest since Nov. 27, according to
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Spot iron ore  at
Tianjin port was unchanged at $132.20 a dry ton yesterday,
according to a gauge compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
