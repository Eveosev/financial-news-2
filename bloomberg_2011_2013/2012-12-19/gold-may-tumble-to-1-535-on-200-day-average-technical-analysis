Gold, down 7.1 percent from the 2012
high in October, may extend its losses through next quarter,
according to technical analysis by Stifel Nicolaus & Co.  The price may drop to $1,535 an ounce if it closes below
the 200-day moving average, said  Dave Lutz , the head of
exchange-traded fund trading and strategy at Stifel Nicolaus in
Baltimore. Futures for February delivery were little changed at
$1,670.10 at 12:51 p.m. on the Comex in New York, after falling
as much as 0.3 percent to $1,665.10. The 200-day moving average
is about $1,669.  Gold is facing “headwinds” amid low inflation and the
prospect for a budget agreement in Congress, Lutz said. If
lawmakers are able to avoid the more than $600 billion in tax
increases and spending cuts set to begin in January, it would
remove an obstacle to economic growth and reduce demand for
precious metals as a haven, he said.  “Low inflation and low-to-medium growth are going to be a
negatives for gold,” Lutz said in a telephone interview.
“Businesses are holding back on spending, but as soon as we get
the budget stuff out of the way, 2013 could certainly be a good
year for growth” in the economy, he said.  The “first stop” for gold will be $1,600, followed by a
drop to $1,535 by the end of the first quarter, Lutz said,
basing his forecast on the price move when futures fell below
the moving average in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
