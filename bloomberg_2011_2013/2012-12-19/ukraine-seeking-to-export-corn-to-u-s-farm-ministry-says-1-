Ukraine is seeking to export corn to
the U.S., where this year’s harvest was reduced by the worst
drought in half a century, Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk said.  “This would be a very important confirmation that our
product has quality and meets all standards,” Prysyazhnyuk told
reporters in Kiev today. Ukraine is trying to agree with the
U.S. on sanitary standards at the moment, he said.  The eastern European nation increased corn plantings for
the 2012 harvest by 26 percent to 4.4 million hectares,
government data show. Ukraine will ship abroad about 12 million
tons of corn in the year ending Aug. 31, Prysyazhnyuk said last
month. The worst drought in the U.S. since 1956 reduced this
year’s harvest, sending corn and soybean prices to records.  Ukraine will increase corn plantings by 5 percent to 7
percent next year, the Agriculture Minister said today. “It is
economically more expedient to grow corn rather than barley,”
Prysyazhnyuk said.  Winter barley areas fell this year to 1.1 million hectares
from 1.3 million hectares last year, he said. Spring barley
plantings will be the same as a year ago, he said.  Corn stockpiles in Ukraine declined as of Dec. 1 to 11.2
million metric tons from 13.9 million tons a year earlier,
government data show. Grain stockpiles declined by 27 percent to
21.4 million tons and also included 6.5 million tons of wheat
and 2.1 million tons of barley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
