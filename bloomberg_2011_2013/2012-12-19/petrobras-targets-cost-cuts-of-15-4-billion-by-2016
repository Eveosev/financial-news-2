Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , the world’s
most indebted publicly traded oil company, plans to cut
operating costs by 32 billion reais ($15.4 billion) between 2013
and 2016 as it ramps up offshore crude reserve investments.  Lowering fuel consumption at offshore production platforms
and reducing chemicals consumption at refineries are among
measures to be put in place, the Rio de Janeiro-based producer
said today in a regulatory filing.  Petrobras will seek to “increase the productivity of the
company’s operational processes,” it said in the filing.  Petrobras’s short and long-term debt totals $92 billion,
more than any other publicly traded oil company, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The company plans to  invest  $236
billion between 2012 and 2016, with the majority earmarked for
exploration and production as it seeks to develop the largest
offshore oil discoveries in the Americas since 1976.  Since becoming chief executive officer in February, Maria das Gracas Silva Foster required company divisions to make
financial revisions, unveiled a $14.8 billion divestment plan
and created a program to increase production efficiency at the
offshore Campos Basin -- the company’s main basin.  Petrobras rose 3.8 percent to close at 20.93 reais in  Sao
Paulo , the highest since Nov. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
