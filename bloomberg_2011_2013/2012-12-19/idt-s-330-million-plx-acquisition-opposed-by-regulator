PLX Technology Inc. (PLXT)  fell the most
since October after the Federal Trade Commission filed an
administrative complaint seeking to block its $330 million
acquisition by electronics components maker  Integrated Device
Technology Inc. (IDTI)   The stock tumbled 17 percent to $3.72 at 1:40 p.m. in  New
York  trading, the steepest decline since Oct. 18. The Sunnyvale,
California-based company has fallen 29 percent this year.  The deal would give the combined firm a near-monopoly on
the PCle switch, a type of integrated circuit crucial to
connectivity in computers and other electronic devices, the FTC
said yesterday in a  statement .  “The combination of IDT and PLX would hurt competition and
lead to higher switch prices, lower innovation in the
marketplace, and reduced customer service,” Richard Feinstein,
director of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition, said in the
statement.  IDT’s proposed acquisition of PLX would give the combined
firm a share of more than 85 percent of the almost $100 million
market for PCle switches, the commission said.  Customers have pitted one company against the other to get
lower prices and the proposed transaction would end this
beneficial rivalry, the FTC said in its complaint.  Graham Robertson, a spokesman for  San Jose , California-
based IDT, declined to comment on the FTC complaint. David Hurd,
a spokesman for PLX, didn’t respond yesterday to voice-mail and
e-mail messages seeking comment on the complaint.  To contact the reporter on this story:
