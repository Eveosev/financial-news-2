Yemen’s President Abdurabuh Mansur Hadi has removed the son of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh
as head of the Republican Guard and restructured the country’s
armed forces, state television reported.  Hadi removed Ahmed Saleh from his post along with Major
General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmer, who led the first armored division,
and divided the armed forces in air, land, marine and border
guard units, according to the report. The Republican Guard and
the armored division have been merged with the rest of the armed
forces, according to the report.  Yemen’s forces were divided last year during the uprising
against Saleh. Hadi also dismissed Yahia Mohammed Saleh, nephew
of the former president, from his post as chief of staff of the
central security forces, freeing the army and security forces
from control of the former president and his family.  The military restructuring army is one of the main
provisions of the power transition accord reached last year by
former president Ali Abdullah Saleh when he stepped down last
year following an uprising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
