The pound rose for a fourth day
against the dollar as minutes showed  Bank of England  policy
makers voted 8-1 to pause a bond-buying program as risks from
the euro-area crisis ease and inflation concerns persist.  Sterling climbed to a three-month high versus the U.S.
currency as the minutes of the Dec. 5-6 meeting showed  David Miles  dissented and sought to increase the asset-purchase  target 
by 25 billion pounds ($40.7 billion). All nine members of the
Monetary Policy Committee voted to keep the benchmark  interest
rate  at a record low of 0.5 percent. U.K. government bonds fell
for a ninth day, the longest losing run since February 2011.  “The market will interpret the 8-1 as being about as
hawkish as one can expect,” said  Neil Jones , head of European
hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. in  London . “They
will begin to price in the possibility of a stronger economic
performance in the first quarter, and consequently there’ll be
demand for the pound and sterling assets.”  The pound strengthened 0.1 percent to $1.6273 at 4:13 p.m.
in London after rising to $1.6307, the highest level since Sept.
21. The U.K. currency fell 0.1 percent to 81.49 pence per euro.  Sterling will strengthen to about $1.67 and 77.50 pence per
euro at the end of the first quarter, Mizuho’s Jones said. A
Bloomberg survey of economists forecasts the U.K. currency will
trade at $1.60 and 80 pence per euro by March 31.  ‘Encouraging’ Signs  The Bank of England halted bond purchases or quantitative
easing in November and is relying on its so-called Funding for
Lending Scheme to boost credit and aid the economic recovery.
The MPC said early signs of the program were “encouraging.”
Still, it said the economy may shrink this quarter and surveys
pointed to “broadly flat underlying output” in the near term.  The  10-year gilt yield  rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.96 percent after climbing to 1.99
percent, the highest level since May 10. The 1.75 percent bond
due in September 2022 dropped 0.05, or 50 pence per 1,000-pound
face amount, to 98.16.  The 10-year  break-even rate , a measure of expectations of
inflation derived from a difference in yield between gilts and
index-linked securities, dropped two basis points to 2.74
percentage points, after climbing to 2.79 percentage points
yesterday, the most since April 19.  Investors holding gilts lost 1.5 percent this month through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds were little changed while Treasuries fell 0.9 percent.  Less Competitive  The strength in the pound this year was making the U.K.
less competitive, the central bank’s minutes showed.  Sterling’s gains between the middle of 2011 and middle of
2012 “had been unwelcome,” according to the statement. The
“deterioration in U.K. competitiveness over the past couple of
years represented a potential headwind to the ability of U.K.
exporters to benefit from a pickup in global growth.”  The pound has appreciated 1.5 percent this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 0.9 percent and
the dollar fell 3.6 percent.  “They are not giving any clear suggestion that they are
ready for more QE, but that is something which could well happen
fairly early next year,” said  Ian Stannard , head of European
currency strategy at Morgan Stanley in London. “We see them use
the phrase that sterling strength is unwelcome. All of this is
increasingly bringing sterling into the policy debate.”  U.K.  retail-sales growth  slowed more than economists
forecast in December, a report from the  Confederation of British
Industry  showed. The gauge of annual sales growth fell to 19
from 33 in November, the business lobby said. Economists had
forecast a decline to 25, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
