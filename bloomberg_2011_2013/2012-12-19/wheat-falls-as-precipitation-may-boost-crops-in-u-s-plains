Wheat fell, heading for its biggest
monthly decline in more than a year, on speculation that rain
and snow in the U.S. Great Plains and Midwest will boost
prospects for crops that are dormant for the winter.  Snow is expected in the southern Plains, where hard-red
winter wheat is grown, and precipitation may fall as a winter
storm covers most of  Iowa ,  Nebraska  and northwestern  Missouri ,
forecaster DTN said in a report today. Concern that crops would
be damaged by the worst U.S. drought since 1956 had helped send
wheat prices up as much as 51 percent since mid-June.  “We’re getting some rain and some snow in areas that
needed it,” Jon Marcus, the president of Lakefront Futures and
Options LLC in Chicago, said by telephone.  Wheat futures for March delivery fell 0.7 percent to settle
at $8.0575 a bushel at 2 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price is down 6.7 percent since Nov. 30, heading for the biggest
monthly slump since September 2011, on speculation that global
stockpiles won’t fall as much as expected.  In the U.S., wheat is the fourth-largest crop, valued at
$14.4 billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
