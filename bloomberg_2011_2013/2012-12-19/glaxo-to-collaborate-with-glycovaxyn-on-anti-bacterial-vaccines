GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) , the U.K.’s
biggest drugmaker, will collaborate with GlycoVaxyn AG to
develop new anti-bacterial conjugate vaccines, an $8 billion
market.  The closely held company will receive an upfront payment
and an equity investment from Glaxo, which has an option to
obtain an exclusive license on vaccines they work on during a
three-year collaboration period, Schlieren, Switzerland-based
GlycoVaxyn said in a  statement  today. The company is also
eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties if the
vaccines win regulatory approval. Financial terms weren’t
disclosed.  GlycoVaxyn  focuses on vaccines against common severe
bacterial infections. Its most advanced program is a vaccine
against the Shigella bacterium, which causes dysentery and
bloody diarrhea. Pre-clinical candidates include vaccines to
prevent hospital infections and E. coli.  “Collaboration with a vaccine industry leader confirms the
potential of our platform to generate new complex vaccines,”
GlycoVaxyn Chief Executive Officer Philippe Dro said in the
statement.  GlycoVaxyn uses recombinant DNA technology that allows it
to target bacterial diseases for which effective vaccines don’t
yet exist, according to the company. Investors in GlycoVaxyn
include Sofinnova Partners, Index Ventures and Edmond de
Rothschild Investment Partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
