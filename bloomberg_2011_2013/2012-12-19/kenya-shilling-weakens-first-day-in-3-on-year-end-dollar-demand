Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for the
first day this week as businesses sought to buy dollars before
the year-end.  The currency of  East Africa ’s biggest economy weakened 0.2
percent to 86.10 a dollar as of 4:45 p.m. in Nairobi.  “There is last-minute demand” for dollars, causing the
weakening of the shilling, Julius Kiriinya, a dealer at Nairobi-
based African Banking Corp., said by phone. “The local currency
will get a reprieve” as business activity slows over the
Christmas period, he said.  The Central Bank of Kenya accepted all 1.75 billion
shillings ($20.3 million) in bids at today’s sale of 14 day
term-auction deposits, a bank official who asked not to be
identified in line with policy, said by phone. The bank had
offered 4 billion shillings.  “We expect the shilling to firm slightly in coming
sessions helped by remittances from expatriate workers and tea
exporters selling dollars after their auction,” Nairobi-based
NIC Bank Ltd. said in a note to clients today.  The Ugandan shilling gained 0.7 percent to 2,648 a dollar,
while Tanzania’s shilling appreciated 0.2 percent to 1,596 a
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
