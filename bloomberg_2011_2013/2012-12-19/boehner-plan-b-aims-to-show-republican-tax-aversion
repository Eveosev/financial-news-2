House Republican leaders are considering giving members a chance to vote on spending cuts to firm up support for House Speaker  John Boehner ’s tax measure, said a Republican lawmaker and a congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.  In announcing his proposal yesterday to raise tax rates for income above $1 million, Boehner had said his plan wouldn’t reverse automatic spending cuts set to take effect in January.  Republican leaders are asking rank-and-file members today what they would support in order to pass Boehner’s plan, which he said would be brought up for a vote tomorrow.  Unless Congress acts, more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts will begin next month.
