The zloty climbed to its strongest
level in 10 weeks after German business confidence improved for
a second month, boosting expectations that  Poland ’s biggest
export market can withstand the euro area’s recession.  The zloty appreciated 0.2 percent to 4.0736 per euro, its
strongest rate since Oct. 10, as of 11:43 a.m. in Warsaw. The
currency has jumped 9.6 percent this year, the steepest gain
among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The yield on 10-
year notes fell less than 1 basis point to 3.90 percent.  The Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, rose to 102.4 in December from 101.4
a month earlier. Ifo’s gauge of the current situation slipped to
107.1 from 108.1, while a measure of executives’ expectations
rose to 97.9, the highest since May, from 95.2 in November. The
Polish economy, which relies on  Germany  for 25 percent of its
sales abroad, slowed to its weakest pace of  growth  in more than
three years last quarter.  “The improvement in the expectations component of the
index may increase confidence in German economic resilience,”
 Rafal Benecki , chief economist for Poland at ING Groep NV in
Warsaw, said in an e-mailed note to clients. “This would boost
the euro-dollar rate and help the zloty.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
