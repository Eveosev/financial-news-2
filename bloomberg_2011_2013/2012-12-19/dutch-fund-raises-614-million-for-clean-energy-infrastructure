Dutch Infrastructure Fund BV, a
Schiphol-based fund management company, raised 463 million euros
($614 million) from investors for renewable-energy and other
infrastructure projects.  DIFâ€™s fourth infrastructure fund reached its second close,
having already raised finance in May, the company said in a
 statement  on its website. It has a target size of 600 million
euros and a cap of 750 million euros at final close, or the last
opportunity for new investors to step in, slated for early 2013.  The fund will seek public-private partnerships and clean-
energy investments offering the long-term, steady gains that
have also attracted retirement funds such as PensionDanmark A/S
and insurer  Allianz SE. (ALV)  DIF has raised 1.3 billion euros of
equity in total.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
