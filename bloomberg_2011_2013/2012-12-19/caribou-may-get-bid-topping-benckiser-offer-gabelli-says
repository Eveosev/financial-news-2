Gamco Investors Inc. (GBL)  head Mario
Gabelli said  Caribou Coffee Co. (CBOU)  is undervalued at Joh. A.
Benckiser Group’s offer price of $16 a share and may get a
higher bid.  “We think it’s statistically undervalued even at $16,”
Gabelli said today in an interview.  Caribou’s  earnings  before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization will increase about 15 percent to $35 million in
2013 from this year, Gabelli said.  Gamco disclosed today in a filing that it raised its stake
in Caribou Coffee from 5.7 percent to 6.8 percent. It disclosed
its 5.7 percent stake on Dec. 18, the day after Benckiser
announced its plans to buy Caribou.  Benckiser, which  bought  Peet’s Coffee & Tea Inc. in
October, earlier this week agreed to purchase Minneapolis-based
Caribou for about $340 million, adding to its coffee portfolio.
The closely held company also recently increased its stake in
D.E Master Blenders 1753 NV.  Caribou rose 0.4 percent to $16.05 at the close in New
York. The shares have gained 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
