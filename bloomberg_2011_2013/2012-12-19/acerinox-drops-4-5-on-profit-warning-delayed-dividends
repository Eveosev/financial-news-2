Acerinox SA (ACX)  declined the most in two
weeks in  Madrid  as the biggest Spanish stainless-steel maker
warned of a possible quarterly loss and delayed its dividend.  The company fell 3.4 percent, the largest slide since Nov.
30. The Madrid-based manufacturer said fourth-quarter earnings
would be similar to those in the third quarter, when it reported
a 31.5 million-euro ($42 million) loss, in a filing today that
blamed “worse-than-expected” market conditions.  Acerinox responded to the weak outlook for steelmakers by
delaying dividends planned for January and April until the July
payment. Bloomberg analysts forecast the gross payment in July
will be 35 euro cents, the same as last year’s total dividends.  The company closed down 31 cents at 8.62 euros, trading 3.2
times its average daily volume over the past three months.  Earnings per share this year are forecast to decline to 10
cents from 30 cents in 2011, according to the average of 14
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
