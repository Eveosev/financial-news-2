Russian  retail-sales  growth
quickened more than economists predicted in November as faster-
than-forecast increases in wages and incomes allowed consumers
to spend more.  Sales rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier, after a revised
4 percent increase in October which was the slowest pace since
January 2011, the  Federal Statistics Service  in Moscow said
today in an e-mailed statement. The median  forecast  of 14
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 4.1 percent advance.
The jobless  rate  rose to a four-month high of 5.4 percent, in
line with analysts’ expectations, from 5.3 percent.  The world’s largest energy exporter has relied on domestic
demand, buoyed by lending growth and low unemployment, to
insulate the economy from  Europe ’s debt crisis and slowing
growth in  China . Gross domestic product grew 2.9 percent from a
year earlier in the third quarter, the slowest pace since it
began recovering at the start of 2010, because of slower farming
and construction.  “All in all, the economy continues muddling through,”
analysts at Troika Dialog said yesterday in an e-mailed note.
“However, the development seems to be sustainable and based on
increasing local demand and improving production efficiency.”  Real average wages increased 7.3 percent from a year
earlier in November, the fastest pace in four months and more
than a 4.9 percent median forecast, the service said. Disposable
incomes advanced 6.7 percent, compared with a 2.6 percent median
estimate, while fixed-capital investment grew a lower-than-
projected 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
