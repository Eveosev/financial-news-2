Running back LeSean McCoy will start
the Philadelphia Eagles’ Dec. 23 home game against the
Washington Redskins after missing four weeks because of a
concussion.  Bryce Brown will serve as McCoy’s backup, Eagles coach Andy Reid told reporters today.  McCoy, who has rushed for 750 yards and two touchdowns this
season, suffered the concussion on Nov. 18 in a 31-6 loss to the
Redskins. The 24-year-old McCoy rushed for at least 1,000 yards
each of the past two seasons.  At 8-6, the Redskins are tied atop the National Football
Conference East Division with the  New York  Giants and the Dallas
Cowboys. The Eagles (4-10) have been eliminated from playoff
consideration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
