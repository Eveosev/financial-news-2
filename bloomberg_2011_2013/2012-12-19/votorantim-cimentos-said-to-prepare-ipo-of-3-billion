Votorantim Cimentos SA, the biggest
cement producer in Brazil, is preparing an initial public equity
offering of at least $3 billion, according to three people with
direct knowledge of the matter.  Votorantim Cimentos hired Banco Itau BBA SA and  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  to manage the deal and will include additional
banks, said the people, who asked not to be identified because
the plan hasn’t been made public. The IPO will take place
sometime next year, they said.  “Such a move is not Votorantim’s actual plan,” the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  Votorantim Cimentos, which expanded into six countries this
year, may make acquisitions in the U.S.,  South America ,  Africa 
and some European countries, former Chief Executive Officer
Walter Schalka said in August. A $3 billion IPO by the Sao
Paulo-based company would be the biggest for Brazil since Banco
Santander Brasil SA’s $7.5 billion offering in 2009.  The cement unit of Brazil’s Grupo Votorantim, controlled by
the Ermirio de Moraes family, completed a swap of its 21.2
percent stake in  Cimpor Cimentos de Portugal SGPS SA (CPR)  in June.
The company gained access to China, India, Turkey, Morocco,
Tunisia and Spain, adding 778 million euros ($1 billion) in
annual sales, according to a June 25 statement.  Officials Itau BBA and JPMorgan declined to comment on the
IPO plan and asked not to be named in keeping with company
policy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
