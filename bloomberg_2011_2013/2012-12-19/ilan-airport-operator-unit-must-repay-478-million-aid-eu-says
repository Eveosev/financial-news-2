SEA Handling SpA, controlled by the
state-owned operator of Milan’s Malpensa and Linate airports,
must repay 360 million euros ($478 million) of Italian
government aid, European Union regulators said.  The European Commission said capital injections for the
unit of Societa Esercizi Aereoportuali SpA from 2002 to 2010
was incompatible with state aid rules and gave an unfair
advantage over rivals who operate without subsidies, according
to an e-mailed statement.  “Italy has to recover the aid received by SEA Handling so
as to restore the level playing field,” the Brussels-based
authority said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
