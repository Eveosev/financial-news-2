Index of 24 raw materials rose 0.7 percent to settle at 644.73
at 3:53 p.m. in New York.  The UBS Bloomberg CMCI index of 26 prices declined 0.1
percent to 1,578.92.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle futures climbed to a record for the fourth straight
session on speculation that a U.S. winter storm will lower
animal weights and delay meat shipments, further shrinking beef
supplies.  Blizzard conditions are forecast for tonight and tomorrow
with 2 inches to 5 inches (5 centimeters to 13 centimeters) of
snow expected in the Central Plains and as much as 15 inches in
parts of Iowa and  Wisconsin , Joel Widenor, a vice president for
Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a
telephone interview. During cold, wet weather, livestock need to
use more energy to stay warm, leading to lower weights.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
February delivery advanced 1.1 percent to $1.3435 a pound.

issued a tender to sell three cargoes of Urals blend for loading
