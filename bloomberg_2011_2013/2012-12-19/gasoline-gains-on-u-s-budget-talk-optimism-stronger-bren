Gasoline and heating oil rose as
President  Barack Obama  and House Republican leaders continued
budget negotiations and as a stronger Brent boosted the prices
of products produced with imported crude.  Futures climbed on optimism that Obama and House Speaker
 John Boehner  will reach a deal to avert the so-called fiscal
cliff, more than $600 billion in automatic tax increases and
spending cuts set for January. Brent gained as much as 1.1
percent in London. German business confidence increased for a
second month in December.  “The macro factors are all green,” said  Addison Armstrong , director of market research at Tradition Energy in
 Stamford , Connecticut. “You have fiscal cliff hopes, there’s a
better tone in Europe, more stimulus talks in Japan and
expectations that the new government in China will come in and
do some stimulus.”  Gasoline for January delivery rose 1.68 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.7077 a gallon at 9:51 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices touched $2.7179, the highest
intraday level since Dec. 4. Futures have advanced 0.8 percent
this year.  Heating oil for January delivery increased 2.14 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $3.0179 a gallon, extending this year’s increase
to 2.8 percent.  Brent rose 77 cents to $109.61 a barrel on the London-based
ICE Futures Europe exchange.  “Products are back to tracking Brent,” Armstrong said.  Weekly Inventories  The Energy Department is scheduled to report last week’s
oil inventories at 10:30 a.m. in Washington. Gasoline stockpiles
probably rose 2 million barrels and  supplies of distillates ,
including heating oil and diesel, increased 1 million barrels,
according to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by
Bloomberg.  The industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute  reported
yesterday that gasoline inventories surged 4.18 million barrels,
while distillates slipped 1.88 million.  The average nationwide cost for  regular gasoline  sank 1
cent to a $3.226 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. That’s
the lowest level since Dec. 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
