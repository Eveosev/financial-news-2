Foreign investors in the solar
 energy industry  in the Czech Republic plan to file an
arbitration lawsuit against the state in the first quarter of
2013, citing “unfair” treatment.  Ipvic, an association of mostly German closely held
companies that invested in the Czech business, will seek
“compensation for considerable financial loss suffered by
investors as a result of the unfair retroactive discriminatory
change in Czech legislation,” spokesman Frank Schulte said in a
statement posted on the association’s website.  In an effort to curb a sudden surge in solar plant
installations that threatened to raise electricity prices, Czech
lawmakers passed a new law in 2010 imposing a retroactive tax on
solar plants hooked to the grid in 2009 and 2010. The law also
raised fees for plants built on agricultural land and slapped a
32 percent levy on carbon credits awarded to the companies,
which reward environment-friendly technologies.  “The Czech government doesn’t take into account
considerable sums that our members invested in good faith and in
accordance with Czech laws,” Schulte said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
