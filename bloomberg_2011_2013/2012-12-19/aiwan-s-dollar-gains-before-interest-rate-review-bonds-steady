Taiwan ’s dollar touched the
strongest level in more than a week and  government bonds  were
little changed before the central bank reviews monetary policy
at a quarterly meeting today.  Governor Perng Fai-nan, who said last week the island’s
economy is rebounding, will hold the benchmark  interest rate  at
1.875 percent, according to all 23 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Global funds bought $1.4 billion more Taiwanese stocks
than they sold this month, taking net purchases in 2012 to $4.6
billion, exchange data show. The yen fell to the lowest level
since August 2011 against the euro amid bets the  Bank of Japan (8301) 
will expand stimulus measures at a meeting that starts today.  “I think the consensus is the central bank will keep rates
unchanged today,” said Sam Chang, a bond trader at Yuanta
Securities Co. in Taipei. “The central bank may try to maintain
relative stability in the  Taiwan dollar  as monetary easing in
developed economies has caused a lot of inflows.”  The Taiwan dollar closed little changed at NT$29.102
against its U.S. counterpart in Taipei, according to data from
Taipei Forex Inc. The currency touched NT$29.036 earlier, the
strongest level since Dec. 10. It has appreciated 4.1 percent
this year, poised for a fourth annual gain.  Taiwan’s central bank has bought the greenback to counter
gains in the island’s currency on most days in the past eight
months, according to traders who asked not to be identified. The
monetary authority’s mandate is to keep relative exchange-rate
stability and to intervene in the event of abnormal moves,
Governor Perng said on Dec. 12.  Volatility Drops  One-month implied volatility in the Taiwan dollar, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.94
percent.  The yield on the government’s 1.125 percent bonds due
September 2022 was at 1.149 percent, unchanged from yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank
lending  rate was little changed at 0.385 percent, a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
