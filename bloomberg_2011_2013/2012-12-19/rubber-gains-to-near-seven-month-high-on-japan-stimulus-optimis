Rubber climbed for a fourth day as
speculation that the  Bank of Japan  will add monetary stimulus
pushed the country’s stocks benchmark to a 10-month high.  Rubber for delivery in May gained as much as 1 percent to
288.5 yen a kilogram ($3,422 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange, nearing a seven-month high for the most-
active contract of 289 yen reached yesterday. Futures were at
287 yen at 11:38 a.m. local time, extending this year’s advance
to 9 percent.  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose above 10,000 for the
first time since April as  Japan ’s central bank begins a two-day
policy meeting.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  surged as much as 2.4 percent
after the Nikkei newspaper reported that the largest Asian
automaker plans to expand global production to a record next
year, raising the outlook for tire demand.  “A bull-run in Japanese stocks fueled a rally in rubber
futures,” Hideshi Matsunaga, an analyst at broker ACE Koeki Co.
in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Incoming Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met BOJ Governor Masaaki
Shirakawa yesterday and requested he agree to an accord
containing the 2 percent inflation target. That’s double the
BOJ’s current goal. Abe’s party swept to victory in elections
for the lower house of parliament on Dec. 16. Japan’s currency
dropped after data showed the nation’s trade deficit swelled,
boosting the appeal of yen-based contracts.  The contract for delivery in May was little changed at
25,275  yuan  ($4,056) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.
Thai rubber free-on-board rose 0.6 percent to 96.15 baht ($3.14)
a kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
