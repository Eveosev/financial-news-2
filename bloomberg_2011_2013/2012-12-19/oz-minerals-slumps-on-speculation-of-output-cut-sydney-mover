OZ Minerals Ltd. (OZL) , Australia’s third-
biggest copper producer, fell the most in almost four years on
speculation it will miss its output target this year, said Chris
Weston, chief market strategist at IG Markets Ltd.  The stock fell 9.8 percent to A$6.71 at the close of
trading in Sydney, its biggest drop since February 2009. The
benchmark  stock index  rose 0.5 percent.  There is no production problem at its Prominent Hill mine
in South Australia and the company expects to meet its full-year
production target of 100,000 metric tons to 110,000 tons for
copper, spokeswoman Rachel Eaves said in an e-mailed response to
Bloomberg questions.  “You don’t just offload a good stock at this time of year
unless you have some sort of conviction and the rumor is there’s
some sort of issue at their mine that potentially could affect
production guidance,” Weston said by phone from  Melbourne .  To contact the reporter on this story:
