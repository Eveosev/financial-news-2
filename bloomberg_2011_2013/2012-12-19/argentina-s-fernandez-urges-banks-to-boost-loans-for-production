Argentina’s President Cristina
Fernandez de Kirchner said the government will ask banks to
boost lending to finance productive projects to at least 17
billion pesos ($3.5 billion), according to a statement posted on
the  presidential website   The government had earlier required banks to lend at least
5 percent of deposits this year for such projects. As of Dec.
17, banks had lent the equivalent of 91 percent of the amount
requested by the government and were likely to surpass the
requirement by the end of the year, Fernandez said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
