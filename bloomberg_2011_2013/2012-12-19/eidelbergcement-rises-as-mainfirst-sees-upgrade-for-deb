HeidelbergCement AG (HEI) , the world’s
third-largest cement maker, jumped the most in more than four
months after MainFirst Bank AG analysts predicted the company
will regain an investment-grade  credit rating  next year.  HeidelbergCement  rose  as much as 5.5 percent to 46.48
euros, the steepest intraday gain since Aug. 3 and the biggest
move today on  Germany ’s benchmark  DAX Index. (DAX)  The stock, which
was trading up 5.3 percent at 1:15 p.m. in Frankfurt, has jumped
42 percent this year, valuing the company at 8.7 billion euros
($11.6 billion).  Debt at the Heidelberg, Germany-based cement producer is
 rated  Ba1 at Moody’s Investors Service, the highest non-
investment grade rating, and an equivalent BB+ at Fitch. The
company cut net debt in the third quarter by almost 10 percent,
and beat a spending-reduction target by 21 percent, it said on
Nov. 8.  “Cash and cost savings have become a vital part of
Heidelberg’s DNA,” Christian Korth and Tobias Fahrenholz,
analysts at Frankfurt-based MainFirst, wrote in research report
today. “We forecast the company to reach investment grade
rating in 2013 already, without divestments being necessary.”  An investment grade, which will also depend on how quickly
rating companies react to earnings improvements, is likely to
attract new investors to HeidelbergCement shares, the analysts
said. It may also mark the start of “meaningful and reliable”
 dividend  payments by the company, they said.  The MainFirst analysts raised their recommendation on the
cement producer’s stock to “outperform” and estimate the share
price will rise to 55 euros in a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
