Lithuania’s new government signed
off on a 17.6 percent increase in the  minimum wage  to fulfill
pre-election promises, the second time the country has raised
the rate in less than a year.  The minimum wage effective Jan. 1 will be 1,000 litai
($385) a month, up from 850 litai since July and 800 litai
before that, according to a decree approved today, the
government in the capital Vilnius said in an e-mailed statement.  “We’re starting to implement the pledges given to
voters,” Prime Minister Algirdas Butkevicius, who took office
last week with his four-party Cabinet, said in the statement.  The change will improve  living standards  for about 200,000
workers in the Baltic nation of 3 million people, including
about 50,000 public sector employees, the government said.  A working group including industry representatives will by
Feb. 1 propose possibly applying a lower minimum-wage
requirement to small and mid-sized companies so that they aren’t
tempted to fire workers or pay wages illegally, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
