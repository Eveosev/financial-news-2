case scenario,” said Kazuyuki Terao, chief investment officer

management as of June 30. “Japan’s new leadership is showing
its resolve that the government and the BOJ will join forces to
beat deflation. The BOJ is under pressure to change, given its
governor is to step down soon.”  Relative Value  Asia’s benchmark equities index has risen 14 percent this
year as central banks from the U.S.,  Europe , Japan and China
took action to spur economic growth. The gauge traded at 14.7
