Whitehaven Coal Ltd. (WHC)  said it hasn’t
received approaches to buy assets from China Shenhua Energy Co.
in  Australia , or any proposal from the Chinese company to take
over the coal producer.  Whitehaven and Shenhua have met in recent months to discuss
a sale of Shenhua’s Watermark coal project in New South Wales
state in return for a stake in the Sydney-based company, the
Australian Financial Review  reported  today, citing unidentified
sources. Whitehaven rejected the proposal, asking Shenhua to
make a takeover bid, the paper said. Whitehaven has a market
value of A$3.5 billion ($3.7 billion).  “Whitehaven has had no proposals from Shenhua to sell its
assets to Whitehaven, nor has there been any proposal from
Shenhua to acquire Whitehaven,” the company said today in a
statement. Whitehaven routinely holds talks with other coal
companies about business opportunities, and has had discussions
“at various times with Shenhua because of the obvious potential
synergies between the assets of each company in the Gunnedah
Basin.”  Whitehaven owns seven mines in NSW, while Shenhua’s
Watermark project is located near Whitehaven’s rail
infrastructure in the Gunnedah basin.  Nathan Tinkler ,
Whitehaven’s biggest shareholder, in August scrapped a takeover
proposal valuing the miner at A$5.3 billion after coal prices
fell.  Whitehaven rose 8.1 percent to A$3.47 at the close of
trading in Sydney, the highest since Aug. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
