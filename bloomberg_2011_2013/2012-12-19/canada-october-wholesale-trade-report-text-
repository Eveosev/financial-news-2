The following is the text
of  Canada ’s wholesale trade report for October from
 Statistics Canada .  Wholesale sales advanced 0.9% to $49.2 billion in October,
following a decline of 1.5% the previous month. Higher sales
were reported in six of seven subsectors, representing 87% of
wholesale sales.  In volume terms, wholesale sales were up 0.8%.  Widespread sales increases  In October, the largest advance in dollar terms was in the
food, beverage and tobacco subsector, where sales increased 1.2%
to $9.6 billion. The  food industry , which accounts for 90% of
the subsector, gained 1.2%.  The motor vehicle and parts subsector rose 1.0%, its first
increase in four months. The new motor vehicle parts and
accessories industry (+3.9%) was responsible for over 90% of the
subsector’s growth. The motor vehicle industry edged up 0.1% for
the month.  Sales in the personal and household goods subsector grew
1.2% in October, following two consecutive monthly declines. The
pharmaceuticals and pharmacy supplies industry (+3.8%) accounted
for most of the increase, more than offsetting the decline in
September.  The miscellaneous subsector posted lower sales for a sixth
consecutive month, falling 0.3%. This was the subsector’s lowest
level since November 2010. Lower sales in the other
miscellaneous industry (-3.0%) and the recyclable material
industry (-8.1%) offset gains in the agricultural supplies
industry (+6.1%) in October.  Wholesale sales up in most provinces  In October, sales were up in eight provinces, with  Quebec ,
Saskatchewan and British Columbia accounting for most of the
national increase.  The largest increase in dollar terms was in Quebec, where
sales rose 2.8% after a decline of 1.9% in September. Higher
sales across several subsectors contributed to the growth in
October.  Sales in Saskatchewan were up 5.6%, following four
consecutive monthly declines.  In British Columbia, sales increased 1.8%, more than
offsetting a decline in September. Sales in this province have
generally been on an upward trend since April 2009.  The largest decrease in dollar terms was in Ontario, where
sales fell 0.4%. After peaking in June 2012, sales have declined
in three of the past four months.  Inventories increase slightly  Inventories edged up 0.2% to $61.5 billion in October,
posting their 10th increase in 11 months. Overall, 12 of the 25
industries registered higher inventories.  The largest increases in dollar terms were in the
construction, forestry, mining and industrial machinery,
equipment and supplies industry (+1.2%) and the agricultural
supplies industry (+3.9%).  The inventory-to-sales ratio declined from 1.26 in
September to 1.25 in October.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time in
months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain
at their current level.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
