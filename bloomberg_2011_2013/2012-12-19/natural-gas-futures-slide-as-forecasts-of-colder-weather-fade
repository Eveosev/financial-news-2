Natural gas futures dropped in New
York for the first time in three days as  weather forecasts  for
late December and early January turned warmer.  Gas slid 2.9 percent after Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted mostly normal temperatures in the
eastern half of the U.S. from Dec. 29 through Jan. 2.
Yesterday’s outlook was for colder-than-average weather in those
regions.  “The weather forecast is becoming as volatile as the
price,” said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy
Management Institute in New York. “The temperature outlook
became much less supportive and the market just started
selling.”  Natural gas for January delivery fell 9.8 cents to settle
at $3.32 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . The futures are up 11 percent this year,
heading for the first annual gain since 2007. Prices declined to
$3.261 per million Btu in intraday trading on Dec. 14, the least
since Sept. 28.  The low in  Chicago  on Jan. 1 may be 20 degrees Fahrenheit
(minus 7 Celsius), 1 more than the usual reading, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . About 50
percent of U.S. households use gas for heating, Energy
Department data show.  Inventory Forecasts  A department report scheduled for release tomorrow will
show gas inventories fell by 75 billion cubic feet last week to
3.731 trillion, according to the median of 21 analyst  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. The five-year average withdrawal for the
period is 144 billion. Last year, supplies declined by 100
billion during the week.  Stockpiles rose 2 billion cubic feet in the week ended Dec.
7 to 3.806 trillion cubic feet, a government report showed Dec.
13. It was the latest seasonal supply gain since Dec. 30, 2005,
according to department data compiled by Bloomberg.  Supplies were 8 percent above the five-year average,
compared with 4.6 percent the previous week. The gas inventory
 surplus  to the average has declined from a six-year high of 61
percent in March, department data show.  Industrial gas demand may climb by 300 million cubic feet a
day in 2013, Barclays Plc said yesterday, citing the expansion
of plants using gas as a feedstock. Industrial consumption
totaled about 18.62 billion cubic feet a day this year,
according to the Energy Department.  ‘Shale Revolution’  “The shale revolution is triggering an avalanche of
industrial capacity expansions,” Biliana Pehlivanova, an
analyst at Barclays in  New York , said in a note to clients.  Stockpiles have reached record highs in each of the past
four years as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, boosted output.
U.S. natural gas production in the lower-48 states rose to a
record in September as new wells in the Northeast’s Marcellus
shale formation started producing, the Energy Department said in
the monthly EIA-914 report released Nov. 30.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway ’s biggest oil and gas producer, bought
70,000 acres in the Marcellus region to boost oil production
amid falling U.S.  gas prices .  The assets, which are currently producing at about 5,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day, have a so-called risked
resource base, a measure of reserves, of 300 million to 500
million barrels of oil equivalent, the Stavanger-based group
said in a  statement  today. The acreage in  Ohio  and  West Virginia 
was purchased from Grenadier Energy Partners LLC, Protege Energy
II LLC and PetroEdge Resources II LLC, Baard Glad Pedersen, a
spokesman for Statoil, said by phone.  Better Market  “A majority of the net acres in this transaction are
located in the liquid-rich part of the Marcellus,” Statoil
said. “The market for these products is substantially better-
paying than the current market for dry gas in the U.S.”  The U.S. raised its forecast for natural gas output in 2012
by 0.6 percent in a report Dec. 11.  Marketed gas production will average 69.22 billion cubic
feet a day this year, up from 68.84 billion estimated in
November, the Energy Department said in its monthly  Short-Term
Energy Outlook . Output may rise 0.5 percent in 2013 to 69.59
billion a day, department estimates show.  Gas prices at the benchmark  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana ,
will average $2.78 per million British thermal units, compared
with the previous estimate of $2.77, according to the report
from the department’s Energy Information Administration.  The boom in oil and natural gas production helped the U.S.
cut its reliance on imported fuel. America met 83 percent of its
energy needs in the first eight months of the year, department
data show. If the trend lasts through 2012, it will be the
highest level of self-sufficiency since 1991.  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
270,891 as of 2:38 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 363,000. Volume was 341,156 yesterday. Open interest was 1.17
million contracts. The three-month average is 1.16 million.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting full
volume and open interest data.  strq  To contact the reporter on this story:
