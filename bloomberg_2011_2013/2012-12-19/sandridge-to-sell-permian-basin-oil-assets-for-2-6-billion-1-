SandRidge Energy Inc. (SD) , the energy
producer that has been fighting shareholder calls to break up
the company, agreed to sell assets in the Permian Basin to
Sheridan Production Partners II for $2.6 billion.  Sheridan, a closely-held producer based in Houston, will
pay cash, SandRidge said today in a news release. SandRidge,
based in  Oklahoma City , produces about 24,500 barrels of oil
equivalent a day from 225,000 acres in the Permian’s Central
Basin Platform.  The sale price exceeds an estimate from John Gerdes, a
Canaccord Genuity analyst based in Houston who said in a Dec. 17
note to clients that the acreage might fetch $2.5 billion.  “The sale of the Permian assets at this time has allowed
us to capitalize on current strong valuations for mature,
conventional Permian assets,” SandRidge Chief Executive Officer
 Tom Ward  said in the statement.  The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter
of 2013. SandRidge will use the proceeds to pay debt and fund
drilling at its Mississippian Lime fields in Oklahoma and
 Kansas , according to the statement.  The deal makes SandRidge “more of a bet on the Horizontal
Mississippian,” said Jason Wangler, an analyst at Wunderlich
Securities Inc. in  San Francisco .  “If that play works, so does SandRidge,” he said. Wangler
rates SandRidge a buy and doesn’t own any of its shares.  Shares Fall  SandRidge announced the sale after the close of regular
trading in  New York . SandRidge rose 8.8 percent to $7.07 in late
trading after closing at $6.50 in New York.  SandRidge’s managers believe “all shareholders should
conclude that this is a great outcome for them,” Greg Dewey, a
spokesman, said in response to e-mailed questions. “We are
simply doing what we said we would do, staying true to our brand
and doing things quickly and efficiently and once again making a
move that creates tremendous value for the Company and its
shareholders.”  SandRidge shares have fallen this year as shareholders
including TPG-Axon Capital Management LP and Mount Kellett
Capital Management LP call for the company to put itself up for
sale.  TPG-Axon, the hedge fund run by former  Goldman Sachs (GS)  banker
 Dinakar Singh , has called for a shareholder vote on replacing
SandRidge’s board of directors. TPG owns 6.5 percent of
SandRidge, and Mount Kellett owns 4.5 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Cutting Debt  SandRidge should avoid “any hasty strategic actions, such
as the precipitous sale of the Permian assets,” until a new
board can be seated, Mount Kellett Chief Operating Officer
Jonathan Fiorello said in a Nov. 15 letter. He estimated the
Permian acreage may be worth $4 billion.  Wangler said the sale may help SandRidge win over
shareholders, since it will allow the company to reduce its
debt.  Other analysts have criticized the sale because it would
increase SandRidge’s reliance on lower-profit natural gas.  “Regrettably, a Permian sale does not improve SandRidge’s
long-term financial standing,” Gerdes wrote in his note.  Selling the assets at $2.5 billion would have funded the
company through through 2014, and SandRidge would outspend its
 cash flow  by $1.2 bilion a year from 2014 to 2017, Gerdes wrote.
He said in an interview he hasn’t had time to review his
calculations based on SandRidge’s higher sales price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
