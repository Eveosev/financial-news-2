KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH) ,  Poland ’s sole
copper producer, rose to the highest in almost 1 1/2 years after
Erste Group Bank AG gave an accumulate recommendation on the
stock.  The shares rose as much as 1.1 percent and traded 0.8
percent up at 194.1 zloty as of 11:08 a.m. in Warsaw, the
highest since July 2011, valuing the Lubin, Poland-based company
at 38.8 billion zloty ($12.7 billion). Erste set its target
price at 210 zloty per share.  KGHM completed Poland’s biggest foreign purchase by buying
 Canada ’s Quadra FNX Mining Ltd for $2.9 billion in cash in
March. In October, the company increased its 2012 profit
forecast 25 percent to 4.74 billion zloty.  “KGHM became a multinational company, which, in our
opinion, deserves a fair comparison versus its closest
international peers,” Michal Zasadzki, a Warsaw-based analyst
at Erste, said in a note to investors. “KGHM is traded with a
14 percent discount” to peers, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
