Sweden ’s central bank should
consider cutting its  main lending rate  next year to the record
lows seen after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holding Inc.,
said Mats Dillen, director-general at the Swedish National
Institute of  Economic Research .  The Riksbank probably has room to gradually lower the repo
rate to 0.25 percent from 1 percent in 2013 to stimulate demand
as inflation is below target and  household debt  concerns are
overblown, Dillen said today in Stockholm.  “It’s natural for the Riksbank to take the biggest
responsibility at this stage to stabilize the economy since
they’re quite some way from the inflation target and growth is
weak,” he said. Household debt “won’t rise much in coming
years. It’s not something we see as a big problem,” he said.  The Riksbank yesterday forecast no more cuts after lowering
its main lending rate for a fourth time in a year as Governor
Stefan Ingves said  consumer sentiment  has weakened and exports
are suffering from slumping European demand. Two of the bank’s
six board members argued for cuts next year to 0.75 percent and
0.5 percent, respectively.  NIER today forecast the Riksbank will only lower rates to
0.75 percent in 2013, as  gross domestic product  growth slows to
0.9 percent this year and 0.8 percent in 2013. Headline
inflation won’t return to the 2 percent target until 2015, after
abating to 0.4 percent next year from 0.9 percent in 2012, NIER
said.  GDP Contraction  The first quarter “will be very weak with a risk of a GDP
contraction,” Dillen said. “Sentiment among households and
companies is much weaker than normal,” and “we have a very
high unemployment,” he said.  A report today showed Swedish  consumer confidence  fell for
a fifth month, slumping to the lowest since April 2009.  The consumer confidence index fell to minus 12.2 from a
minus 7.3 the previous month, the NIER said. The manufacturing
confidence index rose to minus 15 from a revised minus 17. It
was estimated at minus 19.  Sweden’s export-reliant economy will contract a quarterly
0.5 percent in the last three months of this year, NIER forecast
today. Unemployment will rise to an average 8.3 percent next
year from 7.7 percent in 2012, according to NIER.  Abating growth has meant  private borrowing growth  has
slowed in all but one of the last 25 months after household debt
hit a record 173 percent of disposable incomes this year
compared with 90 percent in the mid-1990s as Swedes financed
finance rising property prices. It will stay largely unchanged
at 174 percent next year if the central bank sticks to its
forecast of no more rate cuts, the Riksbank said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
