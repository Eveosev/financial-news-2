Deutsche Rohstoff AG (DR0)  plans to add to
asset sales next year as the German mining and commodity company
seeks to increase its focus on U.S. oil and natural gas output.  Rohstoff, with 63 percent of Tekton Energy LLC, may begin
60 to 80 horizontal drillings in Windsor, north of Denver, as
early as February, it said today in a statement. The company is
in talks with potential investors to finance the program, which
may generate sales of about $180 million by the end of 2015.  “Local permissions have been granted and the also-required
authorization of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation
Commission will hopefully be entirely available by the end of
January 2013,” the company said. The license includes a
potential 20 million barrels of oil-equivalent, it said.  The producer plans to dispose of more assets after selling
its Georgetown gold mine and a stake in Rhein Petroleum, and
focus on units already producing oil, natural gas and wolfram.
Rohstoff plans to pay a dividend for 2012 and may invest in new
projects in 2013, with the board reviewing “several offers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
