AT&T Inc. (T)  won permission from U.S.
regulators to acquire airwaves from four companies including
 Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.  The Federal Communications Commission approved the
acquisitions in  an order  posted on the agency’s website today.
The approval also encompasses AT&T’s acquisition of airwaves
from Horizon Wi-Com LLC and  NextWave Wireless Inc. (WAVE) , the FCC said
in its order.  AT&T, the second-largest U.S. wireless operator, has
proposed at least 24 deals this year to acquire frequencies as
it seeks to catch up with top mobile carrier  Verizon Wireless ,
which is ahead in the race to stockpile the industry’s most
precious asset. The companies involved told the FCC the spectrum
is currently underutilized, the agency said.  Transferring the airwaves to Dallas-based AT&T will help
boost mobile high-speed Internet use, the FCC said in its order.
San Diego Gas & Electric had acquired the airwaves for smart
grid use, the agency said.  The FCC approval will help “spur aggressive investment by
AT&T and create good paying jobs across the wireless and
technology eco-systems,” Joan Marsh, AT&T vice president of
federal regulatory, said in a posting on the company’s public-
policy  blog .  To contact the reporter on this story:
