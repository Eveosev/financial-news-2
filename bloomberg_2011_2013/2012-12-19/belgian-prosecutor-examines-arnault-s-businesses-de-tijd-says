The Brussels prosecutor’s office is
looking into  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  Chief Executive
Officer  Bernard Arnault ’s network of businesses in Belgium,  De
Tijd  and  L’Echo  reported, without saying where they got the
information.  The inquiry, led by Walter Quirynen, head of the financial
section of the prosecutor’s office, began in September in the
framework of Arnault’s request for naturalization in Belgium,
according to L’Echo.  The prosecutor’s office declined to comment on the reasons
for the inquiry, according to the newspapers.  The investigation is a purely administrative procedure that
is automatically triggered by naturalization requests, a
spokesman for Arnault who asked not to be named said when
contacted by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
