Construction has begun on a
wastewater treatment plant in Ontario to reduce the amount of
effluent entering waterways thatâ€™s being financed by the
Canadian government, Ontario province and Kirkland Lake.  Canada  through its Green Infrastructure Fund and Ontario are
providing the majority of an estimated $36 million in project
costs, with the balance from the northeastern provincial town
where miner  Kirkland Lake Gold Inc. (KGI)  is based.  The building of the new plant and conversion of a
decommissioned facility into a pumping station that can handle
overflows is to be completed by the spring of 2014, the
government said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
