nine-month high. Zinc, lead and nickel also declined.  Metal for delivery in three months was little changed at
$8,021.50 a metric ton on the LME at 2 p.m. Shanghai time. It
fell to $8,006.25 on Dec. 17, the lowest since Dec. 7. Copper
for March delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.4
percent to 57,630  yuan  ($9,250) a ton.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rebounded from the lowest price in more than three
months as some investors ended bets on declines, with U.S.
lawmakers seeking an agreement on a new budget to avert
automatic spending cuts and tax rises.  Gold for immediate delivery gained as much as 0.3 percent
to $1,676.85 an ounce and was at $1,675.50 at 1:45 p.m. in
Singapore. The price fell to $1,661.10 yesterday, the lowest
since Aug. 31, as optimism that a deal may be reached boosted
equities and pared demand for the metal as an alternative asset.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Palm oil  declined by the most in a week after China
canceled some soybean purchases, signaling weaker demand for
vegetable oils in the world’s biggest buyer.  The contract for March delivery slid as much as 1.2 percent
to 2,313 ringgit ($758) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the biggest intraday fall since Dec. 12. The price was
at 2,318 ringgit at 12:01 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur .  Rubber advanced to the highest level in more than seven
months as speculation that the  Bank of Japan  will add monetary
stimulus weakened the nation’s currency, boosting the appeal of
yen-based contracts.  Rubber for delivery in May gained 0.7 percent to end at
287.7 yen a kilogram ($3,410 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, the highest level for the most-active
contract at close since May 10. Futures have advanced 9.2
percent this year.  Wheat climbed for a second day on signs of increased demand
from importers amid shrinking supply from shippers including
 Argentina . Soybeans and corn dropped.  Wheat for delivery in March climbed as much as 0.7 percent
to $8.165 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, and was at
$8.13 at 1:20 p.m. in Singapore. While that takes its gain this
year to 25 percent, making it the best performer on the Standard
& Poor’s GSCI Commodity Index of 24 raw materials, it’s dropped
14 percent since trading in July at the highest level in almost
four years.  Soybeans for delivery in March lost 0.3 percent to $14.5675
a bushel after dropping 1.9 percent yesterday on the
cancellation of 420,000 tons of U.S. exports registered for
delivery before Sept. 1, including 300,000 tons bound for  China .
The oilseed has risen 21 percent this year.  Corn for March delivery slipped 0.3 percent to $7.18 a
bushel. Most-active prices have risen 11 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
