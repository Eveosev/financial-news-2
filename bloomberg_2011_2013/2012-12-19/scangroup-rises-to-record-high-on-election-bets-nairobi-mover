Scangroup Ltd. (SCAN) ,  East Africa ’s
biggest marketing company by sales, climbed for a fourth day to
a record high on bets earnings will be boosted by a jump in
advertising for election campaigns.  The stock advanced 2.9 percent to 70.50 shillings by the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, the highest since it was
first publicly traded in 2006. More than seven times the three-
month daily average volume of shares changed hands.  Elections for the presidency and other levels of government
are scheduled for March 2013. Advertising spending in Kenya
surged 43 percent in the first half of 2012 to 40.1 billion
shillings ($467 million) from a year earlier, according to
Nairobi-based market researcher Ipsos-Synovate.  “Campaigns for the upcoming elections seem to have begun
and Scangroup benefits from the advertising spending,” Davis
Mika, an analyst at Nairobi-based Contrarian Investing Kenya
Ltd., said by phone today.  The company is also benefiting from foreign investors who
are seeking exposure to  Africa ’s growing advertising market, Aly Khan Satchu, chief executive officer of Rich Management Ltd., a
Nairobi-based adviser to companies and high net-worth
individuals, said by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
