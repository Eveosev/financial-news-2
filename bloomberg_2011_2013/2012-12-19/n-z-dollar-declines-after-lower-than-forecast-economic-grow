The  New Zealand dollar  dropped the
most in six weeks versus its U.S counterpart after the island
nation’s economy grew less than forecast in the third quarter.  The Australian dollar declined for a third day against the
greenback as U.S. stocks fell on concern American lawmakers are
stalemated on a deficit-reduction deal, reducing demand for
riskier assets. New Zealand’s currency fell versus all of its 16
most-traded counterparts as gross domestic product rose 0.2
percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 from the previous
quarter, compared with a 0.4 percent gain forecast by economists
in a Bloomberg survey, and second-quarter GDP was revised lower.  “Both currencies have been under pressure this entire week
after the  Reserve Bank  of Australia signaled a willingness to
induce greater monetary accommodation in their monthly meeting
minutes,” Ravi Bharadwaj, a market analyst in Washington at
Western Union Business Solutions, a unit of  Western Union Co. (WU) ,
wrote yesterday in a note to clients.  The New Zealand dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell 0.9
percent to 83.41 U.S. cents yesterday in New York after
declining as much as 1 percent. That was the largest drop since
Nov. 7. The kiwi decreased 0.7 percent to 70.39 yen.  Australia’s currency depreciated 0.5 percent to $1.0481. It
sank 0.3 percent to 88.47 yen.  The  S&P 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.8 percent.  In minutes released Dec. 18, the RBA cited a weaker labor
market as a reason for its decision on Dec. 4 to cut  interest
rates . Policy makers at the meeting lowered the bank’s overnight
cash-rate target to 3 percent, from 3.25 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar has strengthened 4.6 percent this
year, the biggest increase among the 10 developed-nation
currencies monitored by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Indexes, and the Aussie has fallen 0.4 percent. The  U.S. dollar 
has slipped 3.3 percent, and the yen has dropped 13 percent to
lead decliners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
