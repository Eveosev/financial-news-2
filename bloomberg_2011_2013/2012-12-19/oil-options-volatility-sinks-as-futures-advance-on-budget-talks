Crude options volatility slipped as
futures rose on optimism the White House and congressional
Republican leaders will reach a budget deal to avert more than
$600 billion in automatic tax increases and spending cuts.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
February, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 24.09 percent on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  as of 3:30 p.m., down from 24.62 percent
yesterday.  “You had this pretty decent up move,” said Fred Rigolini,
vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in  New York .  “It’s
end-of-the-year doldrums and most people are leery of stepping
in with the fiscal uncertainty going into the end of the year.”  February-delivery crude oil advanced $1.58 to settle at
$89.98 a barrel on the Nymex, the fourth consecutive increase.  Futures rose as President  Barack Obama  and House Speaker
 John Boehner  negotiated to avert the so-called fiscal cliff.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
February $80 puts, which fell 17 cents to 31 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,062 contracts at 3:32 p.m. February $85 puts were
the second-most active, with 1,934 lots exchanged as they
declined 37 cents to 89 cents a barrel.  Calls Predominate  Bets that prices would fall, or puts, accounted for 54
percent of electronic trading volume.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, bullish bets accounted for 52
percent of the 72,969 contracts traded.  February $100 calls were the most active options yesterday
with 3,788 contracts changing hands. They declined 1 cent to 14
cents a barrel. June $80 puts fell 28 cents to $2.92 a barrel on
3,253 lots.  Open interest was highest for February $105 calls with
34,094 contracts. Next were February $110 calls at 24,673 lots
and December 2013 $100 calls at 23,633.  To contact the reporter on this story:
