Arsenal said the Dec. 26 Premier
League match with London rival West Ham has been postponed
because of planned strike action.  London Underground train drivers are to hold three strikes
in a dispute over Bank Holiday pay, the first of them on the day
after Christmas.  “This decision has been made now, due to the preparation
period needed to safely operate Emirates Stadium by all the
relevant agencies,” Arsenal said in a statement. The game will
be played on Jan. 23 or 26, depending on the clubs’ F.A. Cup
third-round results, it added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
