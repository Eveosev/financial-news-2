U.K. stocks  advanced to a nine-month
high as German business confidence increased more than estimated
and optimism grew that U.S. lawmakers are making progress in
budget talks.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc (RBS)  led lenders higher.  London Stock Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  advanced
the most in more than four years as it was said to have lowered
its bid for LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd.  CRH Plc (CRH)  climbed 4.9 percent
after Deutsche Bank AG recommended the shares.  CLS Holdings Plc (CLI) 
jumped to the highest price in more than five years.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 25.69 points, or 0.4 percent, to
5,961.59 in London, the highest since March 16. The gauge rose
yesterday as U.S. President  Barack Obama  softened his stance in
budget discussions with Republican House Speaker  John Boehner .
The broader FTSE All-Share Index added 0.5 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index advanced 1.5 percent.  “Investors are more optimistic about a U.S. budget deal,”
said  Manish Singh , who helps manage $2 billion as head of
investment at Crossbridge Capital in London. “The only question
is whether President Obama and Speaker Boehner manage to sell
the compromise deal to their respective constituents in the
Congress, and it’s likely that they will. We will probably end
the year on a good note.”  The FTSE 100 has rallied 7 percent this year as the
 European Central Bank  announced an unlimited bond-buying plan
and the U.S. Federal Reserve expanded asset purchases.  Budget Vote  The U.S. House of Representatives may vote tomorrow on
Boehner’s “plan B,” which would raise tax rates on incomes
over $1 million, rather than the $400,000 threshold that Obama
proposed in his latest offer. Democrats rejected Boehner’s plan,
released yesterday, as inadequate.  Politicians in the world’s largest economy have until the
end of the year to reach an agreement on measures to avoid more
than $600 billion of automatic tax increases and spending cuts
that will otherwise come into effect in January.  German business confidence rose for a second month in
December, topping economists’ estimates. The Ifo institute’s
 business climate index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
climbed to 102.4 from 101.4 in November. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had projected an increase to 102.  In the U.S.,  housing starts  fell 3 percent to a 861,000
annual rate from a revised 888,000 annual pace in October, the
Commerce Department reported today in Washington. The median
estimate of 85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a
drop to 872,000. Building permits, a proxy for future
construction, advanced to a four-year high.  Greek Rating  Standard & Poor’s  raised Greece’s credit rating to B- with
a stable outlook, from selective default. The new grade is the
highest that the ratings company has given to Greece since June
2011, when it lowered the country to CCC from B.  Lloyds gained 4.4 percent to 49.2 pence and RBS advanced
3.4 percent to 315.4 pence.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest
bank, climbed 2 percent to 653 pence. A gauge of banking shares
in the FTSE 350 Index jumped 2.5 percent to the highest level
since May 2011.  LSE advanced 2.9 percent to 1,106 pence, the highest since
May 2008, after three people familiar with the matter said
Europe’s oldest independent bourse lowered its bid for a
majority stake in LCH.Clearnet by 30 percent. LSE said in a
statement it remains in talks with LCH on potential changes to
the deal.  CRH added 4.9 percent to 1,224 pence, the biggest jump
since June, after Deutsche Bank raised its recommendation on the
world’s second-largest maker of construction materials to buy
from neutral, citing a more positive view on the European
building industry for 2013.  CLS Surges  CLS Holdings jumped 4.9 percent to 769.5 pence, the highest
price since January 2007, after saying it obtained planning
approval for a site in London’s Vauxhall Square. The company
said it will build 520 houses, including 110 affordable houses,
two hotels, a hostel, a multiscreen cinema, shops and offices.
The project will cost more than 500 million pounds ($815
million), CLS said.  Vesuvius Plc and  Alent Plc (ALNT)  closed at 324 pence and 309.7
pence, respectively, after Cookson Group Plc split to form the
two companies.  Bunzl Plc (BNZL)  slid 4.3 percent to 1,020 pence, a one-month low,
after JPMorgan Chase & Co. cut the company’s 2013 earnings
estimates by 4 percent, citing a higher interest charge. It also
reduced its target price on the shares to 1,200 pence from 1,250
pence.  Separately, Seymour Pierce Ltd. downgraded the shares to
reduce, the equivalent of sell, from hold. Panmure Gordon & Co.
Plc and Numis Securities Ltd. also lowered their earnings
estimates for Bunzl, after the company said in a trading
statement it expects underlying revenue growth of 2.5 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
