Asia ’s  fuel oil  crack spread
widened, signaling increased losses for refiners turning crude
into residual products. Trafigura Beheer BV extended its gasoil
purchases in Singapore, the region’s largest oil-trading center.  Fuel Oil  PetroChina Co. bought 20,000 metric tons of 380-centistoke
high-sulfur fuel oil from Lukoil OAO at a discount of $2 a ton
to benchmark quotes, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
traders who monitored transactions on the Platts window. The
cargo is for Jan. 14 to Jan. 18 loading.  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Asian marker Dubai crude widened 22
cents to $7.58 a barrel at 3:12 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. This crack
spread widened for a third day.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged for a second day
at $10.25 a ton, PVM said. This means bunker, or marine fuel,
moved in tandem with supplies used in power stations.  Middle Distillates  Trafigura bought 150,000 barrels of  gasoil , or diesel, with
0.5 percent sulfur for a third day, according to the Bloomberg
survey. It paid 30 cents a barrel below average December prices
to Royal Dutch Shell Plc to load from Jan. 12 to Jan. 16.  The Amsterdam-based trader also bought 250,000 barrels of
the fuel with 500 parts-per-million of sulfur from China
International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., known as Unipec,
the survey showed. The shipment, for Jan. 11 to Jan. 15 loading,
changed hands at a premium of $1.40 a barrel to average December
prices.  Trafigura has purchased at least 14 gasoil cargoes of
either grade in Singapore so far this month, totaling 2.6
million barrels.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude rebounded 48 cents to
$19.69 a barrel at 3:12 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
This  crack spread , a measure of processing profit, widened for
the first time in four days.  Jet fuel  dropped 15 cents to a  premium  of 15 cents a barrel
to gasoil, PVM data showed. This regrade snapped a 10-day rising
streak, indicating it is less profitable to make  aviation fuel 
over diesel.  Light Distillates  Shell bought 25,000 tons of naphtha for second-half
February delivery from Mabanaft GmbH at $945 a ton, according to
the Bloomberg survey. Glencore International Plc sold a similar
cargo for first-half March delivery to Vitol Group at $938 a
ton.  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
futures rose $5.36 to $115.86 a ton at 5:18 p.m. Singapore time,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of the profit from making the petrochemical and gasoline
feedstock, widened for the second time in three days.  BP Plc bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline loading
Jan. 5 to Jan. 9 from a unit of SK Innovation Co. at $115.90 a
barrel, according to the Bloomberg survey.  Europe ’s second-
biggest oil company sold the same quantity of 95-RON grade for
loading Jan. 3 to Jan. 7 to Phillips 66 at $118.50 a barrel.  Gunvor Group Ltd. sold 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline
loading Jan. 14 to Jan. 18 to Shell at $118.45 a barrel, the
survey showed.  Refinery News  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., or Sinopec, plans to
process 15.5 million tons of crude next year at its Jinling
refinery, according to an official who asked not to be
identified due to company policy. There are no major maintenance
plans for the 4.5 million ton-a-year plant in 2013.  Tenders  Total SA bought a total of 140,000 tons of paraffinic
naphtha from  Bharat Petroleum  Corp. and Oil & Natural Gas Corp.
for January loading from Mumbai and Hazira, said three traders
who asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Bharat Petroleum offered to sell 35,000 tons of paraffinic
naphtha for January loading from Mumbai, said two traders who
asked not to be named because the information is confidential.  Vietnam National Petroleum Corp., or Petrolimex, sought to
buy about 21,000 tons of 0.25 percent sulfur gasoil and 10,800
tons of 92-RON gasoline for January to March loading, according
to a document e-mailed to potential suppliers.  Indian Oil Corp. canceled an offer to sell 35,000 tons of
naphtha for January loading from Chennai, said two traders who
asked not to be identified because the information is
confidential.  To contact the reporters on this story:
