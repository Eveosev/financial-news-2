The  yuan  gained as the central bank
set the currency’s fixing at the strongest level this month amid
optimism U.S. lawmakers will reach a budget deal to avert tax
increases and spending cuts in  China ’s biggest export market.  The People’s Bank of China raised the reference rate by
0.02 percent to 6.2865 per dollar, the highest since Nov. 27.
The yuan is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the fixing. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of stocks reached a
nine-month high after U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner  said there
would be a vote this week on a plan to raise taxes on income of
more than $1 million a year.  “Risk appetite has improved as it’s likely that the U.S.
budget concerns will be over soon,” said Patrick Cheng, a
foreign-exchange analyst at Haitong International Securities Co.
in Hong Kong. “The PBOC will keep yuan appreciation at a steady
pace given its target to stimulate domestic consumption, while
the export outlook remains grim.”  The yuan climbed 0.03 percent to 6.2306 per dollar as of
10:02 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. The currency has strengthened 0.21 percent this
week, taking this year’s gain to 1 percent. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in exchange rates used
to price options, dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage
point, to 1.75 percent.  Comprehensive Reform  China’s political will to push through more comprehensive
economic reform is “seemingly stronger than we originally
expected,” Credit Suisse Group AG Hong Kong-based analyst
Vincent Chan wrote in a report today. There’s a good chance the
government will introduce a comprehensive economic plan in
October 2013, he wrote.  The  Hong Kong  Monetary Authority injected HK$4.42 billion
($570 million) into its banking system yesterday to prevent the
city’s currency from rising beyond its permitted trading range.
The aggregate balance will increase to HK$246 billion tomorrow.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.03 percent
to 6.2078 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards advanced 0.03 percent to
6.3115, a 1.3 percent discount to the onshore spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
