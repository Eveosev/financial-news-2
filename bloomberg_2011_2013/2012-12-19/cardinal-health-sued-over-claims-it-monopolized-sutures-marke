Cardinal Health Inc., the second
largest U.S. drug distributor by revenue, and medical products
distributor  Owens & Minor Inc. (OMI)  were sued by a Pennsylvania
health system for allegedly monopolizing the sutures market.  The two companies’ dominance in the U.S. markets for
sutures and endomechanical products led to artificially inflated
prices, lawyers for the Schuylkill Health System said in the
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Philadelphia.
Schuylkill Health, which operates two acute-care hospitals in
Pottsville, Pennsylvania, is seeking to represent all direct
purchasers of sutures and endo products.  “The scheme injures purchasers by suppressing competition,
preventing entry and expansion by rivals, imposing
supracompetitive prices and stifling innovation,” lawyers for
Schuylkill said in the complaint.  The health system is seeking to recover three times the
amount of overcharge damages plus court costs.  “We have not been served with a complaint and therefore
cannot comment on the matter,” Debbie Mitchell, a spokeswoman
for Dublin, Ohio-based Cardinal, said in an e-mail.  Trudi Allcott, a spokeswoman for Owens & Minor, based in
Mechanicsville,  Virginia , didn’t immediately return a phone call
seeking comment on the filing.  The case is Schuylkill Health System v.  Cardinal Health
Inc. (CAH) , 12-7065, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).  To contact the reporter on this story:
