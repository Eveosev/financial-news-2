Treasury 10-year yields fell from an
almost seven-week high on concern U.S. officials are failing to
make progress resolving a fiscal showdown that could push the
 U.S. economy  into recession.  The yields pared declines after the U.S. sold $29 billion
of seven-year notes in the sixth auction of coupon-bearing debt
in seven trading days. A year-end budget deadline loomed as the
White House threatened to veto a Republican plan that may face a
vote tomorrow in a move to highlight the party’s opposition to
tax increases. The U.S. faces $600 billion in automatic spending
cuts and tax boosts if officials can’t reach an agreement.  “That’s encouraged further buying,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who oversees $2.1 billion as chief investment officer
at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. “Positions
certainly seem to have hardened from here, which makes a
solution that much more difficult to achieve.”  The benchmark 10-year note  yield  fell two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.8 percent at 5 p.m. New York time
after dropping four basis points earlier to 1.77 percent. The
yield reached 1.85 percent yesterday, the highest since Oct. 25.
The price of the 1.625 percent security maturing in November
2022  gained  1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 98 13/32.  Thirty-year yields declined one basis point to 2.99 percent
after sliding to as low as 2.95 percent. They touched 3.03
percent yesterday, a three-month high.  Volume Falls  Treasury  volume  reported by ICAP Plc, the largest inter-
dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , fell 18 percent to $292
billion. It was $357 billion yesterday, the most since Nov. 7.
Daily volume has averaged $241 billion in 2012.  Volatility in Treasuries reached the highest level in six
weeks yesterday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index,
which measures price swings of U.S. government securities based
on options, rose to 63 basis points, the most since Nov. 6. The
2012 average is 70.3.  President  Barack Obama  told reporters he offered
congressional Republicans a “fair deal” during budget talks
and accused them of “posturing” in negotiations.  Obama would veto an alternate proposal by House Speaker
 John Boehner  because it would put “too big a burden on the
middle class,” White House Communications Director  Dan Pfeiffer 
said in a statement.  Boehner’s “Plan B” would raise tax rates on income over
$1 million, rather than the $400,000 Obama proposed in his
latest offer. The House speaker is looking to pressure the
president to accept deeper spending reductions and a higher
threshold for rate increases.  The spending cuts and tax boosts that are set to begin in
January without an accord could push the world’s biggest economy
into recession, the  Congressional Budget Office  has said.  Auction ‘Icing’  The Treasury sold $165 billion of notes and bonds in
offerings that started on Dec. 11.  “People can only buy so much until the fiscal-cliff
negotiations are wrapped up, or at least have a fairly certain
direction,” said  Jim Vogel , head of agency-debt research at FTN
Financial in  Memphis ,  Tennessee . “The auctions were sort of the
icing on this week’s bad cake.”  The seven-year note sale drew a  yield  of 1.233 percent,
compared with a forecast of 1.242 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of six of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The auction’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.72, versus a 2.75 average at the past 10 sales.  ‘Decent Auction’  “It’s a decent auction,” said Jason Rogan, director of
U.S. government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC a New York-
based brokerage for institutional investors. “It came right on
the screws.”  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 39.9 percent of the notes, compared with
an average of 40.4 percent at the past 10 offerings.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 23.1 percent,
the most in records dating to 2009. The average over the past 10
sales was 15.2 percent.  The  current  seven-year note yield declined one basis point
to 1.22 percent.  The government will sell $14 billion in five-year Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities tomorrow, bringing this week’s
note sales to $113 billion.  The U.S. auctioned $35 billion in five-year securities
yesterday, with direct bidders winning 30.4 percent of the
offering, the most since 2004. At the Dec. 17 offering of $35
billion in  two-year  debt, direct bidders bought 28.4 percent of
the securities, the second-highest amount since 2003, when the
Treasury started releasing the data.  Last Week  The Treasury sold $13 billion of 30-year bonds on Dec. 13,
$21 billion of 10-year notes on Dec. 12 and $32 billion of
three-year debt on Dec. 11.  The Fed bought $1.9 billion of Treasuries today due from
February 2036 to November 2042 under Operation Twist. The
program, which expires at year-end, is replacing shorter-
maturity notes in the central bank’s holdings with longer-term
debt to hold down borrowing costs.  The central bank will begin buying $45 billion of
Treasuries a month next year in an expanded round of
quantitative easing. The new purchases don’t involve selling
shorter-term securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
