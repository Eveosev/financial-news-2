French nitrogen-fertilizer shipments
rose 3 percent in July through October from a year earlier,
industry association Unifa said.  Sales of nitrogen, used by farmers in their fields to boost
plant yields, climbed to 721,000 metric tons in the first four
months of the year that started July 1, Paris-based Unifa wrote
in an e-mailed statement today.  France  is the largest crop grower in the European Union,
and the biggest user of crop nutrients, according to the
International Fertilizer Industry Association. French farmers
are forecast to lift soft-wheat planting for harvesting next
year by 2.8 percent, the  Agriculture Ministry  reported Dec. 11.  “The fertilizer deliveries follow the progress in the area
planted with cereals,” Unifa wrote.  Potassium-fertilizer shipments in France rose 3 percent to
261,000 tons for May 1 to the end of October, compared with a
year earlier, Unifa said. Phosphorus deliveries jumped 13
percent to 210,000 tons, according to the report.  The association tracks nitrogen sales on the basis of a
year that starts July 1, while the marketing year for potassium
and phosphorus begins May 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
