Germany ,  Europe ’s biggest power
market, plans to propose changes to its clean-energy subsidy
system in March to reduce the cost of building wind farms and
solar parks as it shutters nuclear reactors.  The so-called EEG clean-energy law must be modified to
ensure renewables can compete and their expansion is aligned
with power-line construction, Environment Minister Peter Altmaier and Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said today.  “We want to turn the renewable-energy law into the central
steering instrument for the future expansion of renewables,”
Altmaier told reporters in Berlin. The planned overhaul is “at
least as ambitious” as reforming health care or pensions, he
said.  Power supply has moved to the center of Germany’s political
agenda since  Chancellor Angela Merkel  decided in 2011 to replace
nuclear reactors with more fossil-fired plants and a growing
share of clean-energy sources. Her government is seeking to
prevent a voter backlash against rising energy costs before the
next general election in the autumn of 2013.  It’s not yet clear whether the March proposal will result
in a bill before the election, Altmaier said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
