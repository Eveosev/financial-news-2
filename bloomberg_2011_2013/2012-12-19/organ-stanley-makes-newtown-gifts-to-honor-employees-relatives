Morgan Stanley (MS)  contributed $150,000
to charities honoring victims of the mass shooting at a Newtown,
Connecticut, elementary school that killed 20 children and six
adults, including three relatives of bank employees.  The firm set up a fund to support services such as grief
counseling and is contributing to other charities, Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman wrote in a memo to employees
yesterday that was obtained by Bloomberg News. About 1,400
employees have contributed a total of more than $1 million.  Jack Pinto, 6, was the son of Dean Pinto, a Morgan Stanley
lawyer. Mary Sherlach, the school’s psychologist who was killed,
was the wife of Bill Sherlach, a broker at the firm. Grace
McDonnell, 7, was the niece of Paul Minella, who also works in
the firm’s brokerage. Two other Morgan Stanley employees are
married to teachers at the school who were not injured.  “No word or deed can right these wrongs or take away our
colleagues’ suffering –- but as a firm, we can lend them
support,” Gorman wrote in the memo.  President  Barack Obama  pledged his administration will
draft “concrete proposals” by the end of next month to help
stem gun violence in the U.S. after the Dec. 14 shooting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
