Romania â€™s government extended until
the end of 2013 a deadline to sell minority stakes in some
state-owned companies,  Ziarul Financiar  reported, citing a draft
law approved yesterday.  The eastern European country pledged to sell minority
stakes in energy companies, such as natural-gas company Romgaz
SA,  Transgaz SA (TGN)  and nuclear-power operator Nuclearelectrica SA
this year, the Bucharest-based newspaper said.  Romania had also planned to sell stakes in air carrier
Tarom SA and rail freight company CFR Marfa SA. None of the
sales has happened so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
