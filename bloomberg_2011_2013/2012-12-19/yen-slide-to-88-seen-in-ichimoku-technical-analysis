The yen has entered a fifth
weakening cycle since the 1985 Plaza Accord and is poised to
depreciate to about 88 per dollar, according to Bank of Tokyo-
Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., which cited trading patterns.  The conversion line rose above the base line on the monthly
Ichimoku chart of the dollar-yen rate last month, a bullish
signal for the greenback, according to Teppei Ino, an analyst at
the unit of  Japan ’s biggest financial group by market value. In
the near term, the yen is likely to depreciate toward the lower
end of the cloud at 88.69 per dollar should it cross last year’s
weakest point of 85.53, Ino said.  “Dollar-yen has reached a recent high, and it’s looking
like the bullish trend for the pair will continue for some
time,” Tokyo-based Ino said.  Since the Plaza Accord, when finance chiefs from the
largest economies agreed to weaken the dollar, there have been
large run-ups in the dollar-yen rate in 1989, 1996, 2001 and
2005, each lasting more than 18 months, according to Ino. Given
the yen has appreciated “for a long time” since June 2007, the
reversal is likely to take just as long, he said.  The Japanese currency weakened 0.1 percent to 84.33 per
dollar as of 9:03 a.m. in  Tokyo  from yesterday. It touched 84.48
on Dec. 17, the lowest level since April 12, 2011. In October
last year, the yen touched a postwar record of 75.35.  Ichimoku charts are used to predict a currency’s direction
by analyzing the midpoints of historical highs and lows. The
cloud refers to the area between the first and second leading
span lines on the chart and is used to show an area where buy
orders may be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
