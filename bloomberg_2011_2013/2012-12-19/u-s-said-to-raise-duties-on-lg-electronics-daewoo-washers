In a decision  Whirlpool Corp. (WHR)  said
was a victory, the U.S. Commerce Department raised anti-dumping
duties on washing machines from  South Korea  made by  LG
Electronics Inc. (066570)  from preliminary tariffs set in July. They were
lowered on  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)   Levies at 13.02 percent were set for LG and 9.29 percent
for Samsung for selling large, residential washers in the U.S.
below production costs, the department said yesterday in a
statement. Duties of 82.41 percent on Daewoo Electronics Corp.
were left unchanged.  “This decision is an important victory for our 22,000
dedicated U.S. employees, the consumers we serve and the U.S.
appliance industry,” Marc Bitzer, president of Whirlpool North
America region, said in a statement. Whirlpool brought the
complaint.  The department also set duties as high as 72.41 percent on
washer imports from  Mexico .  Warren Connelly, a lawyer for Samsung, said the Commerce
Department employed a controversial practice, looking at a
specific time period in which prices were lower, that allowed it
to set the higher tariffs.  The U.S. also established additional rates to counter
government subsidies it said the Korean manufacturers received.
For Samsung, the rate is 1.85 percent and for Daewoo, 72.3
percent. The additional rates don’t apply to LG.  This is not the last step in the process. The U.S.
International Trade Commission is scheduled to take a final
decision on the case in February, and Samsung predicted that it
would prevail then.  To contact the reporter on this story:
