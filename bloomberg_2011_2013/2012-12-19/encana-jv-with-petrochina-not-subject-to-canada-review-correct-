(Corrects name of federal act in second paragraph.)  Encana Corp. (ECA) ’s C$1.18 ($1.19)
billion joint venture with state-owned Petrochina Co. won’t be
subject to government review, Industry Canada spokeswoman
Margaux Stastny said in an e-mail today.  The deal, in which PetroChina will get a 49.9 percent stake
in Encana’s Duvernay Shale acreage, isn’t subject to the
Investment Canada Act that restricts state-owned companies
seeking to acquire oil-sands businesses, she said.  “Foreign investments that do not involve the acquisition
of control are not reviewable under the Investment Canada Act
except in respect of their national security implications,” she
said in the e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
