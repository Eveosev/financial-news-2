The Bank of  Canada  should refrain
from raising interest rates until the end of next year to help
fuel growth, and the country should use regulation to stem a
further build up of household debt, the International Monetary
Fund said.  “The beginning of the monetary tightening cycle should be
delayed until growth strengthens again,” the Washington-based
fund said in a report on the Canadian economy, adding the
central bank has room for further monetary easing if growth
fades. “The current monetary policy stance is appropriately
accommodative given the negative output gap.”  Canada’s central bank has kept its key  lending rate  at 1
percent for more than two years, the longest pause since the
1950s.  The IMF said global economic uncertainty, including concern
that more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts
will begin next month in the U.S. if Congress doesn’t act, is
containing growth in Canada. The country’s expansion is forecast
to be “just below 2 percent” in 2013.  The impact on Canada from fiscal tightening in the U.S.
will be about three-quarters of the effect in the U.S., the IMF
said, adding the current pace of fiscal consolidation in Canada
is “appropriate.” The IMF said the federal government is on
track to balance its budget by 2015 and has room for a new
temporary fiscal stimulus package if needed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
