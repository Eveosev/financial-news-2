SPX Corp. (SPW)  is close to announcing an
agreement to buy  Gardner Denver Inc. (GDI) , a producer of industrial
air compressors, for more than $4 billion, said a person
familiar with the matter.  SPX, which produces industrial equipment for a variety of
industries, emerged as the leader in the sale process earlier
this month, said two people, who asked not to be named as the
process is private. Gardner Denver canceled meetings with four
private-equity firms also bidding, they said.  A deal would mark a victory for activist investor ValueAct
Capital Management LLC, which owns 5.1 percent of Gardner
Denver’s stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of
Sept. 30. The San Francisco-based firm started pushing for a
sale in July after Gardner Denver Chief Executive Officer Barry Pennypacker quit.  Vikram Kini, a spokesman for Gardner Denver, and SPX
spokesman Ryan Taylor didn’t immediately return calls seeking
comment.  Gardner Denver, based in Wayne,  Pennsylvania , had hired
investment banking firm Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise on
how to deal with ValueAct, people familiar with the matter said
earlier this year. Gardner Denver disclosed in October that it
was working with the firm to explore a possible sale. Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment.  Gardner Denver is valued at about $3.7 billion based on
today’s closing share price of $76. Reuters earlier reported
that SPX was close to an acquisition of Gardner Denver.  To contact the reporter on this story:
