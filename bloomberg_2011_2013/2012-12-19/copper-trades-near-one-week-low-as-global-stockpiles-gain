Copper traded near the lowest level
in more than a week as inventories at the London Metal Exchange
warehouses climbed to a nine-month high. Aluminum, zinc, lead
and nickel also declined.  Metal for delivery in three months was little changed at
$8,025.25 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 10:26
a.m.  Shanghai  time. It fell to $8,006.25 on Dec. 17, the lowest
since Dec. 7. Copper for March delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.5 percent to 57,600 yuan ($9,246) a ton.  LME  inventories  climbed to 300,500 tons as of yesterday,
the highest since Feb. 24, bourse data showed. Those tallied by
the SHFE gained to 205,385 tons as of last week, near a seven-
month high of 205,933 tons for the week ended Nov. 23, according
to the exchange data.  “Although people expect demand to improve next year along
with a recovery of China’s macro economy, the existing
inventories are an overhang on the market,” said Lu Minsu, an
analyst at New Century Futures Co.  The metal for immediate delivery on Shanghai’s Changjiang
market was quoted at a discount of 160  yuan  a ton to the SHFE
front-month futures contract yesterday.  The March contract on the Comex in  New York  was little
changed at $3.656 a pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
