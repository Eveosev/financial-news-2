Greece  came in last in a global
ranking as the least charitable nation after three years of
economic crisis and fiscal austerity, a study shows.  Greece fell two places to the bottom of a 146-country
ranking alongside Montenegro as the countries that gave the
least to charity in 2011, the Charities Aid Foundation said
today. Australia topped the World Giving Index compiled by the
charity, followed by Ireland, Canada,  New Zealand  and the U.S.  The pressure on the household budgets of Greeks was
reflected in most other nations, with the aftershocks of the
2008 financial crisis reducing the amount of time and money
people were willing to devote to charity. The survey showed 28
percent of people gave money to charity last year compared with
almost 30 percent in 2007.  “In large parts of the world, household incomes are being
squeezed, prices are rising and job insecurity is on the
increase, with the result that many simply have less time and
money to spare,” John Low, chief executive of the group said.  In Greece, the share of people donating to charity fell to
5 percent from 7 percent in 2010. Still, 3 percent of Greeks
volunteered time to charitable causes, unchanged from a year
earlier, and 30 percent said they had helped a stranger compared
with 28 percent.  About 165 million Indians, 143 million Americans and 126
Indonesians donated money, the survey showed.  Women donated more money than men in 2011 around the world,
although men were more likely to volunteer time and help a
stranger, the charity said.  Gallup interviewed more than 155,000 people in 146
countries on behalf of the group, which provides financial
services and social finance to charities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
