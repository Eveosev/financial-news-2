Fraser & Neave Ltd. (FNN)  plans to say
that  Overseas Union Enterprise Ltd (OUE) ’s $13.1 billion ($10.7
billion) takeover offer is “not compelling, but fair,”
according to three people with knowledge of the matter.  F&N’s board may announce its view on the bid today, based
on recommendations from adviser JPMorgan Chase & Co., said the
people, who asked not to be named because the deliberations are
private. The language is the same as what F&N directors used to
describe an earlier offer from companies controlled by Thai
billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi.  An  OUE-led group  offered to pay S$9.08 a share for the
company on Nov. 15. Charoen, through  Thai Beverage Pcl (THBEV)  and TCC
Assets Ltd., in September bid S$8.88 a share for the 70 percent
of Singapore-based F&N he didn’t already own. F&N has said it
agreed to pay the OUE consortium a break-up fee of as much as
S$50 million if a competing offer is successful.  F&N traded at  S$9.62 a share  at 11:51 a.m. in  Singapore 
today. The company has a market value of S$13.85 billion at that
price.  Spokesmen at F&N, OUE and JPMorgan declined to comment or
weren’t immediately available to comment on the view.  To contact the reporters on this story:
