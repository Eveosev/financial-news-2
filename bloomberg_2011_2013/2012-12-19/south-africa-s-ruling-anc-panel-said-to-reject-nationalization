A South African ruling party
commission rejected the wholesale nationalization of mines,
while backing proposals to collect additional revenue from
profitable companies, according to two officials on the panel.  A study published by the  African National Congress  in
February called for a 50 percent “resources rent tax” on all
mining operations, triggered once companies earn returns in
excess of about 15 percent annually. The tax would generate
about 40 billion rand ($4.8 billion) at current prices,
according to the study. It concluded that the seizure of mines
would be “an unmitigated economic disaster” for the country.  At a policy conference in June, the party failed to reach
agreement on new taxes or how they would be implemented,
referring the issue to its national conference which is taking
place this week.  The party’s Economic Transformation Commission agreed to
impose additional levies, yet didn’t discuss the issue in detail
and added little to proposals agreed to in June, said the two
officials, who declined to be named because the proposals
haven’t been presented to ANC members at the conference.  The commission’s report still has to be endorsed at a
plenary session of the ANC conference before it is adopted as
party policy. Enoch Godongwana, the head of the ANC’s Economic
Transformation Committee, declined to comment on the proposals.  To contact the reporters on this story:
