The committee that is winding up
failed lender  Glitnir Bank hf  has suggested that Iceland’s
central bank receive so-called golden shares in return for
approving a creditor settlement, Visir reported, without saying
how it got the information.  The shares would allow Sedlabanki to veto changes to
Glitnir’s constitution after a creditor settlement, preventing
any major changes to the company’s operations, the Reykjavik-
based news service  reported .  Glitnir was the first of Iceland’s three major lenders to
fail in October 2008. Together, Glitnir, Kaupthing Bank hf and
Landsbanki Islands hf had balance sheets ten time the size of
the island nation’s $13 billion economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
