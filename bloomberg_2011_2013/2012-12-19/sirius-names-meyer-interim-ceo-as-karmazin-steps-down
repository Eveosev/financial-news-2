Sirius XM Radio Inc. (SIRI)  promoted James
E. Meyer to interim chief executive officer while it seeks a
permanent replacement to Mel Karmazin.  Karmazin said in October he would leave on Feb. 1 after
clashing with  John Malone , the billionaire who plans to take
control of the satellite-radio operator. The board formed a
search committee, led by Liberty Media Corp. CEO Greg Maffei, to
consider internal and external candidates, Sirius said then.  Meyer, Sirius’s president of sales and operations since
2004, will also join the board, according to a statement today.
Meyer was previously president of Aegis Ventures, a general
management consulting company, and provided consultant support
for New York-based Sirius.   To contact the reporter on this story:
