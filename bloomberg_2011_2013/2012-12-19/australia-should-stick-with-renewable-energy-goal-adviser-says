Australia ’s climate change adviser
recommended sticking with the government’s 2020 renewable energy
target to give investors confidence in the industry.  Reviews of the policy to encourage investment in wind and
solar power should occur every four years, rather than every two
years, the  Climate Change Authority said today  in a final report
on the matter.  Australia should retain its plan to get 41,000 gigawatt
hours of electricity from renewable sources by 2020, even though
it would put the country on course to source about 25 percent of
its power from renewable energy rather than the 20 percent
initially intended, the adviser said in its preliminary review
in October. Some power companies including  CLP Holdings Ltd. (2) ’s
Australian unit said the target should be lowered to account for
falling electricity demand and to cut costs.  Today, renewable energy accounts for more than 10 percent
of Australia’s power generation, according to the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
