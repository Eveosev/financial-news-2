  Vale SA (VALE5) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, agreed to pay the equivalent of $553.1 million to
settle Swiss and Brazilian tax disputes as it seeks to resolve
claims that helped drag shares down last year.  Vale  will pay 212 million Swiss francs ($232.8 million) in
installments starting in January through 2015 to settle a tax
claim with Switzerland, the company said in a  statement  today.
Separately, Vale  said  it will pay 663 million reais ($320.3
million) to terminate a legal dispute with the Brazilian state
of  Minas Gerais  for overdue taxes for the 2006-2012 period.  Vale, based in  Rio de Janeiro , is fighting Brazilian
federal and local tax claims as governments seek to boost
revenue from metals and mineral mining.  Brazil  is seeking about
30.7 billion reais of taxes on profit from Vale’s foreign units
in addition to overdue mining royalties. Concern the payments
would cause losses prompted Vale to  slump  22 percent in Sao
Paulo last year, the worst performance since 2008.  Vale had said fourth-quarter earnings will be curbed by
about $451 million after existing provisions, according to
Bloomberg’s calculations.  The dispute with Switzerland stems from differences in the
interpretation of tax breaks granted to the company in 2006,
Vale said a statement before the open of regular trading hours.
The tax exemptions were renewed until 2015, it said.  In Minas Gerais, where the government sought 2.1 billion
reais in taxes for the 2006-2007 period, Vale agreed to pay 168
million reais to terminate the claims, the company said. The
remaining 495 million reais will cover claims for 2008-2012, it
said.  Vale  slid  1.4 percent to close at 40.41 reais in  Sao Paulo ,
declining for the first time in nine days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
