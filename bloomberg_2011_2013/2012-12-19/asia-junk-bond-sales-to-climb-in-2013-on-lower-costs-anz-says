Junk bond sales in  Asia  outside of
 Japan  will climb in 2013 as companies take advantage of record
low borrowing costs, according to  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  Debt risk dropped to the least in 19 months.  Offerings from high-yield issuers in the region increased
4.6 percent to a record $14.8 billion this year while U.S.
dollar-denominated sales from similarly-rated companies globally
surged 44 percent to $351.6 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Junk yields in Asia fell to  5.97 percent 
yesterday, the least in data going back to 2004, HSBC Holdings
Plc indexes show.  “Yields have compressed,” said Owen Gallimore, a
Singapore-based credit trading desk analyst at ANZ. “I expect a
pick-up in high-yield issuance from 2012 levels.”  Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) , a Hong Kong-based maker of steel used
in auto components that’s  rated  Ba1 by Moody’s Investors
Service, sold the most high-yield bonds from Asia denominated in
either dollars, euro or yen this year, issuing $2.1 billion of
securities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The 41
sales from 33 companies since Dec. 31 compares with 31 sales
from 29 borrowers in 2011, the data show.  By comparison, investment-grade bond sales in the region
excluding Japan denominated in so-called G3 currencies have more
than doubled this year to a record $93.7 billion.  Investment-grade debt is rated at least Baa3 by Moody’s or
BBB- by S&P. Bonds with lower ratings are typically known as
junk, speculative-grade, or high-yield.  Bondholder Permission  The most recent sale of junk debt in Asia was from a unit
of Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science and Technology Co., which
issued $600 million of 6.125 percent notes last week, Bloomberg
data show. The unit of the Chinese maker of cranes and drilling
equipment said Dec. 14 it had received bondholder permission to
sell more debt.  The cost of insuring corporate and sovereign bonds in Asia
from non-payment fell to a 19-month low. The Markit iTraxx Asia
index of 40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan dropped 1
basis point to 108 basis points as of 8:44 a.m. in  Hong Kong ,
set for its lowest close since May 2011, Credit Agricole SA and
CMA prices show.  Junk sales may make up about 20 percent to 25 percent of
total dollar bond issuance in the region next year, from 15
percent this year, ANZ’s Gallimore said. The Melbourne-based
bank expects offerings to total $105 billion in 2013, he said.  Credit Risk  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 1 basis point to
119.5 as of 11:44 a.m in Sydney, Credit Agricole prices show.
That’s set for its lowest since August last year, according to
CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices
quoted by dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index also fell 1 basis point to
156 basis points as of 9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The gauge is headed for its least in more than eight
months, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
