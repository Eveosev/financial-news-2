Viktoria Rebensburg of Germany won a
women’s giant slalom race in Are,  Sweden , as she tries to claim
her third straight World Cup championship in the skiing
discipline.  Rebensburg, 23, finished two runs with a combined time of 2
minutes, 28.94 seconds to beat runner-up Anna Fenninger of
Austria by 0.62 seconds.  Slovenia’s  Tina Maze , who had won four straight giant
slalom races, finished third at 2:29.85 and still leads the
discipline standings with 460 points, as well as the overall
standings. Rebensburg moved up to third in giant slalom with 256
points and Austria’s Kathrin Zettel is second, after finishing
10th today in 2:31.34.  Lindsey Vonn , the defending overall World Cup champion from
the U.S., skipped the event while taking a break from the sport
to regain strength after being hospitalized last month with a
stomach infection. Vonn is fourth in the overall standings with
414 points, trailing Maze by 445.  To contact the reporter on this story:
