Temasek Holdings Pte, Singapore’s
state-owned investment company, raised its stake yesterday in
 Olam International Ltd. (OLAM)  after earlier this month saying it would
back the commodity trader’s bond offering.  Temasek boosted its holdings from 16.3 percent to 17
percent, it said today in a  statement  on its website. Aranda
Investments Pte, controlled by Temasek, bought 200,000 shares
for S$293,000 ($240,361) yesterday, according to an Olam filing.  Olam, the world’s second-biggest rice trader, said Dec. 3
it will offer $750 million in bonds and as much as $500 million
in warrants to address any concerns about its liquidity, after
short-seller  Carson Block  said the company may fail. Temasek,
Olam’s second-biggest shareholder, agreed to buy any rights not
taken up by other investors.  “We are pleased to have the opportunity to add to our
stake,” Temasek said today in the  statement .  Olam “represents
a reasonably attractive investment over the long term,” it said.  Shares of Olam gained 4.4 percent to close at S$1.54 in
 Singapore , the highest price in two weeks. The benchmark Straits
Times index rose 0.1 percent.  Temasek could end up holding as much as 29 percent of Olam
if it exercises all the warrants in 2016 at the earliest,
according to Sunny Verghese, Olam’s chief executive officer.  The stock has slumped 11 percent since Nov. 19 when Block
first said at a London conference he was selling Olam shares
short and that the company was at risk of collapse. Shorting
refers to investors borrowing shares and selling them, betting a
decline in prices will allow them to profit by buying them at a
lower price later.  Olam said it faces no risk of insolvency and sued Block and
his research firm Muddy Waters LLC on Nov. 21 in the Singapore
High Court, calling the comments malicious falsehoods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
