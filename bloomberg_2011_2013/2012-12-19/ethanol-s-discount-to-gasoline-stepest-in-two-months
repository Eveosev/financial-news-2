Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
futures weakened to the widest level in two months on ample
stockpiles of the biofuel.  Ethanol futures fell to the lowest price since June 28 on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade after an Energy Department report
showed  stockpiles  rose 4 percent last week to 20.8 million
barrels, the most in six months. Imports more than tripled to
37,000 barrels a day from 12,000 the previous week.  These are “tough times for ethanol producers,” said Will Babler, a broker at Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,
 Illinois . “That was a big, big stocks number. There’s plenty
out there.”  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline expanded to 52.91 cents a
gallon, the widest spread since Oct. 10, based on futures
settlement prices. It was 43.59 cents yesterday. The
differential has averaged 61.25 cents this year.  Denatured ethanol for January delivery fell 4.1 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $2.214 a gallon in Chicago. The futures have
tumbled 19 percent in the past five months.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in Chicago at
$2.25 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf at $2.315, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Ethanol on the West Coast slumped 4.5 cents to $2.365 a
gallon and in  New York  the additive sank 2 cents to $2.33.  Gasoline Gains  Gasoline for January delivery rose 5.22 cents, or 1.9
percent, to settle at $2.7431 a gallon on the Nymex. The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Babler said ethanol’s discount to the motor fuel hasn’t
been enough to stoke demand in the face of the glut.  “It’s a good blend spread, but it doesn’t look like anyone
wants it,” he said.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 93 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool last week, up from 90 percent in the
seven days ended Dec. 7, the Energy Department report showed.
The fuel has averaged about 91 percent this year.  Corn for March delivery fell 17 cents, or 2.4 percent, to
$7.03 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  Based on March contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 32 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, down from
33 cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed
from the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of
ethanol production that can be fed to livestock, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  Ethanol on the Brazilian spot market  is fetching $2.06 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, sank 15 percent to 4.76 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. RINs are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
