The United Nations-overseen
emissions-market regulator has approved a system of rules that
will allow farmers using genetically improved seeds to claim
carbon offset credits, according to Arcadia Biosciences Inc.  Nitrogen-efficient seed allows farmers to maintain high
crop yields while using less fertilizer, the Davis, California-
based agricultural-technology company said today in a statement.  Nitrogen is a large source of agricultural emissions
because less than half the volume applied to fields globally is
used by plants, with most of the rest entering water systems or
converting into nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas almost 300 times
more potent than carbon dioxide, the company said.  “There are significant opportunities for agriculture to
play a central role in the cost-effective mitigation of  climate
change ,” Eric Rey, president of Arcadia Biosciences, said in
the statement. “We are particularly pleased with the approval
of this new methodology because it is the first to recognize the
huge opportunity for genetic improvements to mitigate climate
change and create value at multiple levels.”  The rules approved by the Clean Development Mechanism
Executive Board in Bonn, known as a methodology, will
potentially add to supply of credits in a market that’s plunged
92 percent in the past year because of a glut. Certified
Emission Reduction credits for December next year fell as much
as 7.5 percent yesterday to a record 37 euro cents ($0.49) a
metric ton and hadn’t traded today on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London .  The CDM, formed as part of the 1997  Kyoto Protocol , is the
largest carbon offset market, having generated $215 billion in
investment for greenhouse gas mitigation projects around the
world, Arcadia said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
