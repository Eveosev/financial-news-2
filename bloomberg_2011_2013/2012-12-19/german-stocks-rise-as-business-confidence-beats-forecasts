German stocks  rose, with the
benchmark  DAX (DAX)  Index climbing to its highest in nearly five years
as business confidence increased in December more than expected.  HeidelbergCement AG (HEI)  gained 3.6 percent as a gauge of
construction companies advanced after Deutsche Bank AG
reiterated its positive industry outlook.  SAP AG (SAP)  rose after
rival Oracle Corp. posted fiscal second-quarter sales and profit
that exceeded analysts’ estimates.  ThyssenKrupp AG (TKA)  advanced 2.2
percent as Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded the stock.  The DAX added 0.3 percent to 7,672.84 at 10:41 a.m. in
 Frankfurt , its highest level since January 2008. The gauge has
 rallied 29 percent  from its low on June 5 as European Central
Bank policy makers agreed on an unlimited bond-purchase program
and the  Federal Reserve  announced a third round of quantitative
easing. The broader HDAX Index rose 0.3 percent today.  The Ifo institute’s  business climate index , based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 102.4 from 101.4 in
November. That’s the second straight increase after sentiment
dropped to a 2 1/2 year low in October. Economists predicted a
gain to 102, according to the median forecast of 43 economists
in a  Bloomberg News survey .  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington  may show that housing starts fell to an 872,000
annual rate in November after reaching a four-year high 894,000
rate in October, according to the median forecast of 85
economists. Building permits, a proxy for future construction,
probably rose to an 875,000 annual pace.  Construction Gains  HeidelbergCement, the world’s third-largest maker of the
building material, gained 3.6 percent to 45.64 euros. A gauge of
construction stocks rose the second most among the 19 industry
groups in the  Stoxx Europe 600 Index. (SXXP)   Deutsche Bank reiterated its positive stance on building
stocks, including HeidelbergCement, citing increased investor
confidence in a turnaround, cost savings and strong balance
sheets.  SAP, the largest maker of enterprise software, advanced 0.7
percent to 61.10 euros after Oracle reported profit excluding
some items of 64 cents a shares and adjusted revenue of $9.11
billion. That beat the average analyst estimates for profit of
61 cents and sales of $9.02 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  ThyssenKrupp added 2.2 percent to 18.54 euros. Credit
Suisse upgraded the stock to outperform, the equivalent of a buy
rating, from neutral, saying the planned disposal of its
Americas unit will remove a loss-making business and
substantially change the steelmaker’s long-term outlook.  The company’s management is focused on engineering which
will bolster its business model, according to Credit Suisse.  Merck KGaA (MRK)  sank 3.3 percent to 98.25 euros as its
experimental drug L-BLP25 missed the main goal of a trial in
lung cancer patients, denting the company’s ambitions of turning
the medicine into a $1 billion-a-year product.  The drug, formerly known as Stimuvax, failed to improve
patient survival significantly in the late-stage trial of more
than 1,500 patients known as Start, Darmstadt, Germany-based
Merck said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
