Gold fell for a second day in New
York on speculation that a recovery in U.S. housing and
improving prospects for a budget deal in Congress will ease
pressure on the Federal Reserve to expand monetary stimulus.  Builders in November capped the strongest three months for
residential construction in four years, and building permits
advanced to four-year high, a U.S. government report showed
today. Lawmakers are in talks to avert more than $600 billion in
tax increases and spending cuts set to begin next month, which
is a “major risk factor” to the economy, Fed Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke said last week, after announcing plans for additional
stimulus.  “The Fed has said they’re going to be doing everything
they can on concern over the fiscal cliff, and without that
concern, we may avoid the need for further stimulus,”  David Meger , the director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets
in  Chicago , said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for February delivery slid 0.2 percent to
settle at $1,667.70 an ounce at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. The price touched $1,662 yesterday, the lowest since Aug.
31. The metal is up 6.4 percent this year.  Silver futures for March delivery fell 1.7 percent to
$31.116 an ounce in New York, after dropping to $31.085, the
lowest since Nov. 6.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
January delivery lost 0.1 percent to $1,592.90 an ounce, capping
a third straight decline.  Palladium futures for March delivery climbed 1.1 percent to
$698.35 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
