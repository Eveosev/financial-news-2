Syrian rebels fighting to overthrow
President Bashar al-Assad seized a section of the highway
linking the country’s north and south, severing the supply route
between the nation’s two biggest cities.  The Free Syrian Army seized the strategic highway, which
runs from Damascus to the northern city of Aleppo, yesterday,
according to opposition activist websites. The thoroughfare also
serves as a branching off point for most of the country’s other
major cities.  Assad has been fighting an uprising since March 2011 that’s
killed about 44,000 people, according to the U.K.-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights. The opposition has made gains
against Assad’s forces and controls mainly Sunni Muslim areas
stretching from the northeastern outskirts of the capital to
areas in the southwest.  Fighting killed at least 128 people yesterday, including 42
in Damascus and its suburbs, the opposition Local Coordination
Committees said in an e-mailed statement.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov
and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius have said during the
past week that Assad’s days may be numbered.  Syria ’s civil war is destined for stalemate, with neither
the rebels nor the military able to prevail in the conflict,
Syrian Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa told Al-Akhbar newspaper.
His comments were posted on its English-language website on Dec.
