New York  Mets relief pitcher Frank
Francisco underwent surgery to remove a bone spur from his right
elbow, the Major League Baseball team said yesterday.  Francisco, 33, should begin throwing in six weeks and
probably will be ready for opening day on April 1 when the Mets
host the  San Diego Padres , the team said in an e-mailed release.  Mets Medical Director David Altchek performed the surgery
yesterday at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan.  Francisco had a 1-3 record with 23 saves while posting a
5.53 earned run average in 48 games last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
