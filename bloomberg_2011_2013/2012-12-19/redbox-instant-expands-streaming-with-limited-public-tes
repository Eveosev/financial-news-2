Redbox Instant by Verizon , the new
online-video service, expanded a test of its subscription
streaming by opening it to a wider group of invited users.  The company, a venture between  Coinstar Inc. (CSTR) â€™s Redbox and
 Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) , announced the expansion today on
Twitter Inc.  The service is counting on price and convenience to gain a
foothold in the online-video market. Customers will be able to
buy unlimited streaming and four rentals per month from Redbox
kiosks for $8 or $9. The higher price includes access to Blu-ray
disks. Streaming-only is $6 a month, Chief Executive Officer
Shawn Strickland said in a Dec. 12 interview.  The Twitter announcement directs readers to
 RedboxInstant.com  to request an invitation for the expanded
trial run. The service was previously being tested by about
2,000 employees of New York-based Verizon, the second-largest
U.S. phone company.  A full commercial rollout is expected in the first quarter
of 2013, the company has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
