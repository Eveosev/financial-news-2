Eastern Tobacco,  Egypt ’s monopoly
cigarette maker, resumed production after reaching agreement
with workers who had been on strike for two days, Fatma Ramadan
of the Egyptian trade union federation said in a phone
interview.  The agreement was confirmed by a company official, who
requested anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to disclose the
details publicly. The signing of the accord was attended by
government representatives, he said.  “Factories in all our branches are now back in operation
as we have reached an agreement to fulfill workers’ demands,”
the official said. Ramadan, who heads the union federation’s
strike committee, said she had yet to see the text of the
agreement.  Production at Eastern Tobacco was halted yesterday because
of the strike, the company said in an e-mailed statement to the
bourse.  One of the workers’ main demands is the resignation of
Nabeel Abdel Aziz,  Eastern Tobacco (EAST) ’s chairman, according to an
e-mailed statement by the union federation. Eastern Tobacco’s
holding company hasn’t yet made a statement on that.  The workers also sought increased bonuses, to be paid in
one installment at the start of the year rather than in three,
permanent jobs for temporary workers and improved working
conditions, the federation said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
