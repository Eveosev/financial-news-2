Lithuania’s central bank is seeking
a merger of  AB Ukio Bankas (UKB1L)  and AB Siauliu Bankas with the help
of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Eversus
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The plan would avert deterioration of the unprofitable Ukio
Bankas and create the Baltic nation’s third biggest lender by
deposits, after local units of SEB AB and  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , the
online  business magazine  said. The EBRD has been the largest
shareholder of Siauliu Bankas since 2005, Eversus said.  The Bank of Lithuania won’t comment on the report, its
spokesman Giedrius Simonavicius said by phone in Vilnius today
when contacted by Bloomberg.  The EBRD won’t comment on the transaction, Head of Media
Relations Anthony Williams said by phone from  London .  “We continue our work with Siaulu Bankas, a long-standing
partner of the EBRD in Lithuania,” he said. “As always, the
EBRD will review opportunities as they arise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
