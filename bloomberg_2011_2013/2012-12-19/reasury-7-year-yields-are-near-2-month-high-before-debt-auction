Treasuries rose for the first time
in three days as the White House said President  Barack Obama 
would veto a Republican budget proposal in a fiscal showdown
that could push the U.S. economy into recession.  Bonds remained higher after the U.S. auctioned $29 billion
in seven-year debt in the third of four note sales this week
totaling $113 billion. House Speaker John Boehner pushed for a
vote tomorrow on a Republican alternate budget proposal to
highlight the party’s opposition to tax increases sought by
Obama as the year-end budget deadline approached. The U.S. faces
more than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax boosts
if officials can’t reach an agreement.  “That’s encouraged further buying,” said Christopher Sullivan, who oversees $2.1 billion as chief investment officer
at United Nations Federal Credit Union in New York. “Positions
certainly seem to have hardened from here, which makes a
solution that much more difficult to achieve.”  The 10-year note  yield  declined two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.8 percent at 1:08 p.m. New York time
after touching 1.83 percent earlier. The yield reached 1.85
percent yesterday. The price of the 1.625 percent security
maturing in November 2022 rose 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000 face
amount, to 98 13/32.  Thirty-year bond yields fell two basis points to 2.98
percent after reaching 3.03 percent yesterday.  Auction Results  The seven-year notes auctioned  yielded  1.233 percent,
compared with a forecast of 1.242 percent in a Bloomberg News
survey of six of the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary dealers. The
bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids
with the amount offered, was 2.72, versus a 2.75 average at the
past 10 sales.  The  current  seven-year yield declined two basis points to
1.21 percent after touching 1.25 percent earlier.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 39.9 percent of the notes, compared with
an average for the past 10 offerings of 40.4 percent.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 23.1 percent of
the notes, the most in records dating to 2009.  Seven-year notes have returned 3.2 percent this year
compared with a 1.7 percent gain by Treasuries overall,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The seven-
year securities rose 13.7 percent in 2011, while Treasuries
overall advanced 9.8 percent.  TIPS Sale  The Treasury will sell $14 billion in five-year Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities tomorrow. It auctioned $35
billion in two-year notes on Dec. 17 at a yield of 0.245 percent
and sold the same amount of five-year debt yesterday at a yield
of 0.769 percent.  Obama would veto Boehner’s proposal because it would put
“too big a burden on the middle class,” White House
Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said in a statement.  The president told reporters later he’s open to
negotiations and “eager” for a solution. He said the Republican
position “defies logic.”  Boehner’s “Plan B” would raise tax rates on income over
$1 million, rather than the $400,000 Obama proposed in his
latest offer. The House speaker is looking to pressure Obama to
accept deeper spending cuts and a higher threshold for rate
increases.  Recession Possible  The spending cuts and tax boosts set to begin in January
without an agreement may push the world’s biggest economy into a
recession, the Congressional Budget Office has said.  Volatility in Treasuries reached the highest level in six
weeks yesterday. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index,
which measures price swings of U.S. government securities based
on options, rose to 63 basis points, the most since Nov. 6. The
2012 average is 70.3.  The Federal Reserve purchased $1.9 billion of Treasuries
today due from February 2036 to November 2042 under Operation
Twist. The program, which expires at year-end, is replacing
shorter-maturity notes in the central bank’s holdings with
longer-term debt to hold down borrowing costs.  The central bank will begin buying $45 billion of
Treasuries a month next year in an expanded round of
quantitative easing. The new purchases don’t involve selling
shorter-term securities.  To contact the reporters on this story:
