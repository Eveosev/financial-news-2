The U.K. said it’s delaying for as
many as four years a decision on whether to include  greenhouse
gases  from international aviation and shipping in its five-year
carbon budgets, which set a ceiling on national emissions.  Energy Secretary Ed Davey today cited “uncertainty” over
international rules to reduce emissions from planes and ships
that cross boundaries when deferring the decision, which had
been due by the end of 2012.  The government “will revisit this issue when setting the
fifth carbon budget,” Davey said today in a statement posted on
Parliament’s website.  The fifth carbon budget, capping U.K. emissions for the
five years from 2028 through 2032, is due to be set in 2016.
Domestic aviation and shipping are already included in the
budgets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
