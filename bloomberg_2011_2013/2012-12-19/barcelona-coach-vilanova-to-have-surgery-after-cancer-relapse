Barcelona coach Tito Vilanova has
suffered a relapse after cancer treatment last year and will
have surgery tomorrow, the four-time European soccer champion
club said.  Vilanova had surgery to remove a tumor from a throat gland
in November 2011 when he was assistant coach to Pep Guardiola.
He returned to work two weeks later.  After the surgery, Vilanova will undergo chemotherapy and
radiation treatment for approximately six weeks, the club said
on its website.  “During this time, and depending on how well he recovers,
Vilanova’s treatment may be compatible with his work life,”
Barca said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
