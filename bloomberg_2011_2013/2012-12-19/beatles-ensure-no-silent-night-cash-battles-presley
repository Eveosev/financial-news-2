Fans of Johnny Cash, the Beatles and
Elvis Presley have their presents all taken care of -- at a
price.  The battle of the Christmas box sets is back, with each
providing enough listening to last the holiday season.  “The Beatles Stereo Vinyl Box Set” does just what it says
on the handsome case. Inside are 14 old-fashioned albums and a
hardback book.  It’s the first time the Fabs’ first four albums and “Past
Masters” recordings have come in this stereo 180-gram vinyl
form. Play it chronologically and marvel at the progression in
just six years from the schoolboy rhymes of “Love Me Do” to the
studio mastery on “Abbey Road.” Expect to pay about $320.
Rating: *****.  For those on smaller budgets, the Beatles reissued “Yellow
Submarine” and “Magical Mystery Tour” this year for the group’s
50th anniversary, priced about $17. Not their finest moments,
though lovingly restored. Rating: ***.  “The Complete Columbia Album Collection” by Cash has more
than 900 songs spread out over some 60 discs. While not all of
the tracks are great, the hit rate is pretty good, and there’s a
lot of material never before issued on CD. $160. Rating: ****.  The year has seen a lot of British artists fit their oeuvre
into neat boxes.  “Studio Albums” by the Who has the exceptional “My
Generation” and “Who’s Next.” It’s a shame that it includes the
dispensable “It’s Hard” and “Endless Wire.” Who fans might
prefer the newly released “Live at Hull,” a companion piece to
“Live at Leeds.” $360. Rating: ***½.  “Blur 21” covers 21 discs. That’s a lot of listening, and
you might prefer one of the Britpop band’s compilations, which
cherry-pick the best. $170. Rating: ***½.  “The Complete Studio Recordings” by Roxy Music is more
concise and still finds space for outtakes and single edits.  One can only wonder what the group might have done if Brian Eno had stayed. Bryan Ferry’s conventional song “For Your
Pleasure” gradually gets more distorted over seven minutes as
Eno introduces echo, feedback, and finally Judi Dench’s words:
“You don’t ask why.” $80. Rating: *****.  The English Beat has a five-CD set “The Complete Beat.”
It’s a more than comprehensive picture of an act whose hits
include the likeable, lightweight “Mirror in the Bathroom.”
$140. Rating: **.  Those seeking heavier fare might prefer “The Complete
Columbia Albums Collection” by Blue Oyster Cult. This is for
truly dedicated fans of the maniacs that brought the world
“Don’t Fear the Reaper.” “On Your Feet or On Your Knees” is a
thunderous live album that won’t make for a quiet Christmas.
$120. Rating: *.  “Studio Albums 1968-1979” by Joni Mitchell is an altogether
different affair. “I Had a King,” with its wonderful high pitch,
evolves quickly into the assured songwriting of “Chelsea
Morning” and “Both Sides Now.” Then come the breathtaking “Blue”
and the increasingly sophisticated and jazzy sounds of “Hejira.”
I love these albums so much. $62 on import. Rating: *****.  “Prince From Another Planet” by Presley is a definitive
take on his sellout shows at Madison Square Garden in 1972.
There’s also an interview in which Elvis says he’d like to
perform abroad. “I’d like to, very much, I’ve never been out of
this country except in service.” $26. Rating: ****.  “The Velvet Underground & Nico” now comes in a 45th
anniversary, six-disc version. The Scepter studio sessions and
Factory rehearsals in 1966 are added to that album with the Andy Warhol banana cover. Four versions of “Heroin” is a bit much,
though there is a spine-chilling take on “European Son” and a
new remaster of Nico’s “Chelsea Girl.” $90. Rating: *****.  This year has seen a bumper crop of classic rock albums
being reissued in deluxe editions.  My favorites include Sugar’s “Copper Blue,” Peter Gabriel’s
“So,” the Prodigy’s “The Fat of the Land,” Interpol’s “Turn on
the Bright Lights,” “Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness” by
Smashing Pumpkins and “XX” by Rage Against the Machine. Rating:
***** for the original albums, *** for the extras.  I’ve already reviewed “Grrr!” by the Rolling Stones,
“Loveless” by My Bloody Valentine, Michael Jackson’s “Bad,” Paul Simon’s “Graceland,” Amy Winehouse’s “At the  BBC ,” “L.A. Woman”
by the Doors and David Bowie’s “Ziggy Stardust.” All fine boxes
for Christmas.  Those wishing to remember the late Dave Brubeck have his
“Columbia Studio Albums Collection 1955-1966”; Woody Guthrie
fans will enjoy “The Centennial Collection” and Frank Zappa
aficionados can pick from more than 60 of his reissued albums.  (Mark Beech writes for Muse, the arts and leisure section
