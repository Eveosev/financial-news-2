Informa Plc (INF) , the publisher of
Lloyd’s List, rose to the highest in almost two years after
Panmure Gordon & Co. named the stock its top 2013 pick among
medium- and large-capitalization U.K. media companies.  The shares advanced 1.5 percent to 455.2 pence, the highest
price since February 2011, gaining a fifth day and giving the
Zug, Switzerland-based company a market value of 2.74 billion
pounds ($4.46 billion).  “In 2013, we expect Informa to go the ‘extra mile’ and
reward investors even more,”  Alex DeGroote , an analyst at
Panmure with a buy rating, said in a note to clients.
“Improving revenues and bid speculation are all supportive.”  DeGroote raised his 12-month price target to 575 pence from
525 pence in anticipation of the company introducing a share
buyback program and on prospects of faster revenue growth than
investors expect.  Informa sold events businesses in Hungary,  Austria , the
 Czech Republic  and Germany in the first half as a result of
Europe’s debt crisis. It may sell some of its smaller
businesses, Chief Executive Officer Peter Rigby said last month.  The company isn’t interested in buying Springer Science,
which German publisher  Axel Springer AG (SPR)  is selling, as it is too
expensive, Rigby said at the time.  The shares have risen 18 percent since Nov. 14 when Nomura
said that the company was a potential takeover target. It is up
26 percent this year, ranking eighth of 13 stocks in the FTSE
350 Media Index. The FTSE All-Share Index has gained 9.3 percent
this year.  Informa was also Panmure’s top media pick for 2012.  The publisher was cut to neutral from buy by Roddy Davidson
at Westhouse Securities Ltd. on basis of its recent share gains.
Davidson maintained his 470 pence 12-month price target. The
stock has 18  buy ratings , seven hold ratings and one sell
recommendation among 26 analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
