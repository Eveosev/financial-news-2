The European Central Bank avoided a
legal challenge to its purchase of euro-area government debt and
acceptance of Greek, Irish and Portuguese debt from banks as
collateral after the bloc’s top court threw out the case.  A lower European Union court was right to reject the
challenge by Stefan Staedter in Berlin as “manifestly
inadmissible” because it was filed more than two months after
the start of the ECB’s bond-buying program and decisions to
accept collateral, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said in
a  ruling  published on its website.  Staedter, a lawyer working for German-based campaign group
Europolis, had brought the case. Europolis is headed by academic
Markus C. Kerber who last year asked  Germany ’s constitutional
court to block the country’s participation in the EU bailout of
 Portugal .  “It’s a poor decision,” said Kerber in a phone interview
today. The decision, dated Nov. 15 “is not conclusive” and
“it’s inconsistent with the criteria for admissibility,” he
said. “We couldn’t know when these bond purchases were made by
the ECB, because since 2010 they were made with irregular
intervals.”  Kerber is involved in a pending lawsuit at the EU’s top
court in which a group including more than 7,000 plaintiffs is
suing the Frankfurt-based ECB over its proposal to buy unlimited
bonds from debt-laden countries to regain control of interest
rates in nations that make up the monetary union.  The case is: C102/12 P, Stefan Staedter v. European Central
Bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
