Japan  will import fewer than 160,000
barrels a day of oil from  Iran  next year to avoid sanctions
aimed at the Middle Eastern country’s nuclear program, the head
of Japan’s oil industry group said.  JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corp., the country’s biggest refiner,
will cut its imports from the current contract of about 80,000
barrels a day, Kimura Yasushi, who serves as chairman for both
JX and the Petroleum Association of Japan, said at a press
conference today.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in March exempted Japan
from sanctions on banks doing business with Iran because of the
Asian country’s steps to reduce imports from the Persian Gulf
nation. The waiver was renewed in September for a second six-
month term for Japan, which was the world’s biggest importer of
Iranian crude after in  China  in the first half of 2011,
according to the U.S. Department of Energy.  Imports from Iran averaged 190,000 barrels a day from
January to October, 40 percent less than the same period last
year, and fell to 160,000 barrels a day in October, Kimura said.  “Maintaining that 160,000 barrels a day as a ceiling,
refiners will look into reducing more, as JX cuts its own
imports,” said Kimura, who declined to comment on how much
purchases would be cut. “We will tackle this while keeping a
close eye on the U.S.’s policy on Iran.”  U.S. and European Union officials say Iran’s nuclear
development is aimed at producing atomic weapons, while the
government in Tehran says the project is for civilian purposes.  To contact the reporters on this story:
