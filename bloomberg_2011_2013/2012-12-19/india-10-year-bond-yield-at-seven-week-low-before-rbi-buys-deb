India ’s 10-year government bonds
were little changed, with the yield near a seven-week low,
before the central bank purchases debt this week to help ease a
cash squeeze.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will purchase as much as 80
billion rupees ($1.5 billion) of notes due in 2018, 2020 and
2026 on Dec. 21, according to a statement on its website
yesterday. The RBI held interest  rates  for a fifth month
yesterday, while signaling it could cut in coming months.
Inflation eased to a 10-month low of 7.2 percent in November,
official data show.  “Open-market operations are likely to remain the preferred
tool to inject liquidity and that is positive for bonds,”  Rohit Arora  and  Igor Arsenin , strategists at Barclays Plc in
 Singapore , wrote in a research note today. “Downside surprises
in inflation in the past couple of months have paved the way for
the central bank to start easing from January.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 was
unchanged from yesterday at 8.15 percent in Mumbai, according to
the central bank’s trading system. It touched 8.14 percent on
Dec. 14 and Dec. 17, which were the lowest levels since Oct. 29.
The yield has dropped 42 basis points this year.  “In view of inflation pressures ebbing, monetary policy
has to increasingly shift focus and respond to the threats to
growth,” the RBI said in its statement yesterday.  The central bank has bought 1.1 trillion rupees of
 government securities  this fiscal year that started April 1.
Lenders borrowed 1.52 trillion rupees from the RBI’s overnight
repurchase window yesterday, the most since March, indicating a
cash squeeze in the financial system. Indian local-currency
sovereign bonds returned 10 percent this year, the best
performance after Indonesia among 10 Asian indexes compiled by
HSBC Holdings Plc.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point to 7.67 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
