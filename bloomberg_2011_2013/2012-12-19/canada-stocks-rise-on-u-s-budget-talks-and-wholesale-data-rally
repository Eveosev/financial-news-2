Canadian  stocks  rose a second day as
U.S. budget talks inched forward and wholesale sales rose more
than expected in October, adding to evidence the economy may
have accelerated in the fourth quarter.  Uranium One Inc. added 5.7 percent for a fourth day of
gains after the pro-nuclear Liberal Democratic Party won a
landslide election victory in  Japan  on Dec. 16. Toronto-Dominion
Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia rose at least 0.6 percent as
financial stocks contributed most to gains in the  Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Composite Index. (SPTSX)  Alacer Gold Corp. and Eldorado Gold
Corp. slipped at least 1.5 percent as the price of the metal
declined for a second day.  The S&P/TSX rose 36.07 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,370.41
at 9:52 a.m. in Toronto. The equity gauge has gained 3.5 percent
this year.  Canadian  wholesale  sales rebounded in October from the
biggest drop in almost two years, led by higher food and motor
vehicle receipts. Other reports published this month have shown
greater-than-forecast increases in employment and building
permits.  The House may vote tomorrow on House Speaker John Boehner’s
“Plan B,” which would raise tax rates on income over $1
million, rather than the $400,000 threshold the president
proposed in his latest offer. The Obama administration and
Democrats rejected the Boehner plan, released yesterday, as
inadequate. Government leaders are negotiating to avoid more
than $600 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases
set to begin in the new year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
