Hundreds of South Sudanese civilians
are sheltering at a United Nations peacekeepers’s base to escape
an outbreak of violence a week after nine people died in clashes
between protesters and the army in the town of Wau, the UN said.  “As a result of outbreaks of violence, several hundred
civilians, primarily women and children, have been allowed to
seek safety at the Unmiss camp in Wau,” Kouider Zerrouk,
spokesman for the  United Nations Mission in South Sudan , said
today by phone from Juba, the capital.  Violence erupted in Wau, the capital of Western Bahr El
Ghazal state, on Dec. 8 and Dec. 9 after the army clashed with
protesters opposing plans to transfer the administrative
headquarters from the town to Baggari.  Government spokesman Barnaba Marial Benjamin didn’t answer
calls seeking comment about today’s violence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
