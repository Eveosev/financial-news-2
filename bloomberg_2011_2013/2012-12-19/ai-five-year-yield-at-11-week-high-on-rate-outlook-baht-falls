Thailand’s five-year government
bonds fell, pushing the yield to an 11-week high, on speculation
the central bank won’t need to cut  interest rates  as the global
economy improves. The baht declined.  U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner  is trying to sell a tax
rise for top earners to fellow Republicans to reach a deal to
avert more than $600 billion of automatic spending cuts and tax
increases in the world’s largest economy. The  Bank of Japan (8301) ,
which ends a two-day meeting tomorrow, will probably boost
monetary stimulus, 17 of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
forecast. Thai consumer prices rose 2.7 percent in November from
a year earlier, the least in three months, official data show.  Bond yields are climbing because of “the improving outlook
for the global economy and risk assets,” said Jens Lauschke, a
fixed-income strategist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in  Singapore .  The yield on the 5.125 percent bonds due March 2018
increased one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.31
percent as of 3:19 p.m. in Bangkok, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. That was the highest level since Oct. 2. The yield
has risen five basis points this year.  The central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged
last month after an unexpected cut in October, and signaled it
may be done with easing.  Thailand ’s economy may expand 5.8 percent in 2012, compared
with an earlier prediction of 5.7 percent, Bank of Thailand
Governor Prasarn Trairatvorakul said at a seminar in Bangkok on
Dec. 13. The economy may grow 4.7 percent next year, higher than
the previous 4.6 percent projection, he said.  The baht fell 0.1 percent to 30.60 per dollar, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency has appreciated 3.1
percent this year. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, increased two
percentage points, to 4.30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
