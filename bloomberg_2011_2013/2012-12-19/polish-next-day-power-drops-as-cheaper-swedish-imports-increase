Polish day-ahead electricity  dropped
to its lowest level this week as flows of cheaper power from
 Sweden  were set to increase.  Next-day power fell 4.3 percent to 184.29 zloty ($59.89) a
megawatt-hour, exchange data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Poland  was set to receive electricity via an undersea cable
from Sweden tomorrow during the evening demand peak, data from
the power grid manager PSE Operator SA showed. Power for the
next day in Sweden’s SE4 area, to which Poland is connected,
settled at 44.28 euros ($58.73) a megawatt-hour, down 14
percent, according to the Nord Pool Spot AS power exchange.  Less power was set to flow from Poland to the Czech
Republic, Slovakia and  Germany  as prices in the region fell.  Day-ahead electricity on the coupled markets of the  Czech
Republic  and Slovakia slumped 15 percent to 45.12 euros a
megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countries’
market operators. Hungarian day-ahead power slid 15 percent to
45.27 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
