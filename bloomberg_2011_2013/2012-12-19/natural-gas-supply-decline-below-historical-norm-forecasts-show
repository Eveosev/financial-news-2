Natural gas inventories fell by less
than average last week as warm weather reduced heating-fuel
demand, analyst forecasts compiled by Bloomberg show.  Stockpiles dropped 76 billion cubic feet to 3.73 trillion
cubic feet in the week ended Dec. 14, based on the median of 22
estimates. The five-year average stockpile change for the period
is a decline of 144 billion, according to the Energy Department.  Estimates ranged from decreases of 57 billion to 82 billion
cubic feet. The department’s weekly supply report is scheduled
for release at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington .  Temperatures were higher than average in the eastern U.S.
last week, MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,  Maryland , said.
New York City’s low Dec. 10 was 44 degrees Fahrenheit (7
Celsius), 10 above normal, the National Weather Service said.  Storage withdrawals this month could reach “an all-time
record low for December,” said Martin King, an analyst at
FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. “It’s still too early to
call the winter yet, but much colder temperatures are needed
very soon to avoid another pricing apocalypse for the
industry.”  Natural gas futures have climbed 0.6 cent to $3.32 per
million British thermal so far this week on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Prices have gained 11 percent this year,
heading for the first annual increase since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
