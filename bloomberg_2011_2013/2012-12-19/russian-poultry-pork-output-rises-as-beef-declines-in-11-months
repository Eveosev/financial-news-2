Russia produced more pork and
poultry in the first 11 months of the year and less beef,
government figures showed.  Production of pork gained almost 15 percent from a year
earlier and fell 4.6 percent for beef, the Federal State
Statistics Service said in an e-mailed statement today. Output
of poultry and byproducts increased about 14 percent, it said,
without giving amounts.  Beef production in November dropped 7.4 percent from a year
earlier to 15,500 metric tons, said Rosstat, as the service is
known. Pork output climbed 17 percent to 85,800 tons, while
poultry production rose 5.5 percent to 288,000 tons.  Cattle and poultry output by so-called live weight, which
includes skin, bones and byproducts, rose 7.2 percent to 10.2
million tons in the 11-month period, according to Rosstat.  Russiaâ€™s cattle herd amounted to 20.4 million head by the
end of November, little changed from a year earlier. The number
of cows increased 0.5 percent to 8.9 million. Populations gained
7.7 percent to 19.3 million for hogs and expanded 6.4 percent to
25.1 million for sheep and goats, Rosstat said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
