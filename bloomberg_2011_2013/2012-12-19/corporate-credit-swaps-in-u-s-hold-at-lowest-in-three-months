A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk held at about the lowest level in three months as German
business confidence increased for a second month in December.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 0.3
basis point to 88.8 basis points at 8:09 a.m. in New York,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The measure reached
87.7 basis points yesterday, the lowest intraday level since the
latest version of the index started trading on Sept. 20.  Strength in  Europe ’s largest economy may support a euro-
area recovery next year, allaying concern that global financial
improvement is faltering.  Germany ’s Ifo institute’s business
climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to
102.4 from 101.4 in November. That’s the second straight
increase after sentiment dropped to a 2 1/2-year low in October.
Economists predicted a reading of 102, according to the median
of 43 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
