Japanese  shares  rose, pushing the
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  above 10,000 for the first time since
April, amid optimism the Bank of  Japan  will add easing tomorrow
at the close of a two-day policy meeting.  Steelmakers (TPIRON)  advanced
on prospects for more public works to stimulate the economy.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest
lender, jumped 6.1 percent amid bets for more monetary easing.
Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Co., the nation’s second-biggest life
insurer, advanced 9.1 percent. Toyota Motor Corp. gained 3.5
percent after the Nikkei newspaper reported the carmaker plans
to raise its vehicle output next year. Canon Inc., the world’s
largest camera maker, led exporters higher as the yen traded
near a 20-month low against the dollar. Kobe Steel Ltd. soared
13 percent.  The Nikkei 225 gained 2.4 percent to 10,160.40 at the close
of trading in  Tokyo , the highest since March 28. The broader
Topix Index climbed 2.8 percent to 839.34, with all but one of
its  33 industry groups  advancing. Volume on the two stock gauges
was double the 30-day average.  “The Bank of Japan is likely to expand the asset-
purchasing program to stimulate and sustain growth momentum,”
Takahiro Sekido, a strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Ltd. who formerly worked at the central bank, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. “We expect around 10 trillion
yen, mainly by JGB purchasing. This kind of policy will
encourage yen selling and support overseas investments into
Japanese corporates.”  The benchmark Nikkei 225  climbed 17 percent  since Nov. 14
when elections were called. Shares rose on expectations the
Liberal Democratic Party, which returned to power at the polls
last weekend, will raise spending and secure more easing from
the central bank to boost the economy.  LDP Budget  The LDP and coalition partner Komeito have agreed to pass a
supplementary budget possibly worth more than 10 trillion yen
($119 billion), the Nikkei newspaper reported. The BOJ will
probably increase monetary stimulus tomorrow after a two-day
policy meeting that starts today, 17 of the 21 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg estimated.  Banks provided the second-biggest boost to the Topix, after
transport equipment companies and electronics makers, on
speculation an increase in monetary easing will boost the
economy.  Mitsubishi UFJ rose 6.1 percent to 435 yen.  Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest bank by market
value, gained 4.2 percent to 3,010 yen. Dai-Ichi Life jumped 9.1
percent to 113,200 yen.  The yen fell to its lowest level against the euro since
August last year, and fell 0.2 percent to 84.35 to the dollar. A
weaker Japanese currency raises exporters’ overseas income when
repatriated.  Exporters Rise  Canon, which receives about 80 percent of its revenue
overseas, gained 6.5 percent to 3,455 yen. Honda Motor Co.,
which counts North America as its biggest market, climbed 6.2
percent to 3,070 yen.  Toyota increased 3.5 percent to 3,850 yen, the second-
biggest single boost to the Topix. The automaker will announce a
boost to its production target to 9.9 million vehicles for 2013,
the Nikkei reported.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures climbed less than 0.1
percent today. The gauge rose 1.2 percent yesterday amid signs
of progress by President  Barack Obama  and Republicans to reach a
budget agreement to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, $600
billion in spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect
unless a compromise is reached.  Plan B  Obama proposed a budget that would cut about $1.2 trillion
in federal spending and raise a similar amount in taxes in the
next decade, according to a person familiar with the talks.
House Speaker John Boehner said he will push a budget “plan B”
that would include tax increases on income of more than $1
million, countering an offer from Obama who to raise rates on
those earning more than $400,000.  Steelmakers recorded the second-biggest gain today among
the Topix’s industry groups on expectations the LDP will push
for more infrastructure projects. Kobe Steel soared 13 percent
to 103 yen, while Nisshin Steel Holdings Co. gained 6.4 percent
to 711 yen.  The Topix trades at 0.99 times  book value , compared with
2.1 for the S&P 500 and 1.5 for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than the value of their assets.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  rose 8.5 percent
to 18.62 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.3
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
