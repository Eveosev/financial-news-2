U.K. natural gas prices were little
changed as trading volumes declined and the network manager
forecast a balanced system.  Next-month gas rose 0.2 percent on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in  London . The amount of gas traded fell 14 percent
yesterday to the lowest level this month.  Gas for January climbed 0.09 pence, or 0.1 percent, to
66.95 pence a therm at 4:14 p.m. London time. Thatâ€™s equal to
$10.89 a million British thermal units and compares with $3.35
for gas in the U.S.  Gas for today erased earlier gains and was unchanged at 66
pence, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg.  Demand in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. tomorrow will be 307
million cubic meters versus a seasonal norm of 298 million,
 National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show. The system will contain 341 million
cubic meters at that time, down from 343 million at the start of
today.  Gas accounted for 32 percent of U.K. power production at
4:10 p.m., grid data show. Coal generated 40 percent, nuclear 54
percent and wind output rose to its highest since Dec. 14,
accounting for 7.8 percent of the total.  Electricity for the next working day fell 2.4 percent to
47.85 pounds a megawatt-hour, the lowest since Nov. 23, broker
data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
