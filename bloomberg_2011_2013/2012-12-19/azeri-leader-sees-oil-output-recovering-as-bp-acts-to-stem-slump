BP Plc (BP/) , the U.K. oil producer
leading Azerbaijan’s biggest energy projects, will stem a drop
in output in the country after responding “responsibly” to
criticism from Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev , the leader said.  “I am very glad that BP, which is our main partner,
responded to my views and criticisms very responsibly,” Aliyev
said in comments published today in the state-run daily
newspaper  Azarbaycan . “The BP president spoke to me about his
company’s plans for the coming years. I am glad that the
stabilization of oil output is the priority.”  Production at the BP-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oilfield
fell 12 percent in the first half of the year, prompting Aliyev
to call on the London-based company to fix “grave mistakes.”
BP has since replaced regional managers and brought in
technicians to address “challenges” at the Caspian Sea field,
which provided 78 percent of  Azerbaijan ’s total output in 2011.  The country’s cooperation with BP is “built on a very
strong basis,” Aliyev said, describing reports of his criticism
as exaggerated. “Starting from next year, our oil production
will stabilize and sustainable oil production will continue for
many years.”  Azerbaijan is the third-largest oil producer in the former
 Soviet Union , after Russia and  Kazakhstan . Its output fell 10
percent last year to 45.6 million metric tons, and dropped 6.8
percent in the first 11 months of this year, the State
Statistics Committee said Dec. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
