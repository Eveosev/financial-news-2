State regulators say U.S. health
officials need a role in overseeing so-called compounding
pharmacies following the  meningitis outbreak  that killed 39
people this year.  Health officials from the states and  Food and Drug
Administration  met today to discuss whether the federal agency
should take more responsibility when compounding pharmacies go
beyond the traditional role of preparing personalized
prescriptions. The states typically oversee these pharmacies
while the FDA regulates drug manufacturing.  Contaminated steroid shots for back pain from New England
Compounding Pharmacy Inc., known as NECC, led to  620 infections ,
including the deaths, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Members of Congress argued the FDA
should have treated the company like a drug manufacturer and
shut it down while FDA Commissioner  Margaret Hamburg  said a
patchwork of regulations restrained the agency from acting.  “I think most states feel that, with respect, that with
the responsibilities within their own states they have the
knowledge and the tools and the resources to address traditional
compounding,” Hamburg said today in a briefing with reporters.
“It gets more complicated when you get into the continuum of
compounding.”  NECC suspended operations Oct. 3 and recalled 17,676 doses
of the pain-killing steroid linked to the meningitis outbreak in
19 states.  To contact the reporter on this story:
