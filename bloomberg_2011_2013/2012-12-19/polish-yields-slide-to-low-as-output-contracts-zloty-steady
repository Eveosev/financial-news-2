The yield on  Poland ’s benchmark 10-
year notes fell to within one basis point of a record low after
industrial output unexpectedly declined last month, boosting the
case for interest rate cuts.  The yield on notes due in October 2023 dropped four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.87 percent as of 4:53
p.m. in Warsaw. The zloty pared intraday gains to trade little
changed at 4.0831 against the euro.  Production fell 0.8 percent from a year earlier, after a
4.6 percent increase in October, the Central Statistics Office
in Warsaw said today. That compared with a median estimate for a
0.5 percent increase in a Bloomberg survey of 26 economists. The
European Union’s biggest eastern economy is feeling the impact
of the recession in the euro area and the central bank cut rates
by a quarter point for a second month in December.  “The data raise the probability of a more pronounced rate
cut in January,” Ernest Pytlarczyk, chief economist at BRE Bank
SA in Warsaw, wrote in an e-mailed comment today.  Forward rate agreements, used to speculate on interest rate
levels, showed traders’ bets for 106 basis points in reductions
by mid 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
