A measure of European interbank
lending stress rose from the lowest in six weeks, according to a
money-market indicator.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight index swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was 12.2
basis points at 8:15 a.m. in London from 11.1 yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The spread, a measure of banks’
reluctance to make unsecured loans to one another, reached the
lowest since Nov. 6 yesterday.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars was little
changed with the three-month cross-currency  basis swap  at 23
basis points below Euribor. The one-year basis swap was 24.5
basis points below Euribor from minus 25 yesterday. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.072
percent yesterday from 0.071 the day before. The Eonia swap, an
estimate of overnight borrowing costs over the next three
months, was little changed at 6.2 basis points.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday to 239 billion euros ($316 billion) from 249 billion
euros the day before. That compares with this year’s average of
498 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
