Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell a
cargo of  North Sea  Forties crude, the first offer to emerge in
about five days. Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc didn’t
find sellers for the grade for a third day as they bid at the
same price as yesterday.  OAO Surgutneftegas,  Russia ’s fourth-largest oil producer,
issued a tender to sell three cargoes of Urals blend for loading
in January from two Baltic ports, according to a document
obtained by  Bloomberg News .  North Sea  Trafigura offered Forties for loading from Jan. 13 to Jan.
15 at a premium of 89 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window showed.  Shell bid at 80 cents more than to Dated Brent for a Jan. 8
to Jan. 10 consignment, according to the survey. Statoil sought
to buy at the same price for a Jan. 8 to Jan. 11 cargo.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days rose 2 cents to 76 cents more
than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for February settlement traded at $109.79 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, compared with $108.75 in the previous session. The March
contract was at $108.92, a discount of 87 cents to February.  Mediterranean/Urals  There were no bids or offers for Urals for a second day,
according to the Platts survey.  Surgutneftegas is offering one shipment each for Jan. 8 to
Jan. 9 and Jan. 10 to Jan. 11 from Primorsk, the tender showed.  The company is also seeking to sell one lot for Jan. 5 to
Jan. 6 from Ust-Luga, according to the document. The tender
closes tomorrow. Each consignment is of 100,000 metric tons.  The Urals differential to Dated Brent in the Mediterranean
widened 2 cents to minus 30 cents, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. In northwest Europe, the  discount  to Dated Brent
increased 5 cents to $1.05, the data showed.  West Africa  Angola ,  Africa ’s second-largest oil producer, will cut
exports of Plutonio crude in February while shipments of Palanca
grade will be stable at one lot, two loading programs obtained
by Bloomberg News showed.  The country is scheduled to ship six consignments of 1
million barrels each of Plutonio in February, one less than next
month, according to a loading plan. The Palanca shipment is for
985,000 barrels, a second plan showed.  Qua Iboe blend dropped 1 cent to at $2.66 a barrel more
than Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s close to an eight-month high at $2.72 on Dec. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
