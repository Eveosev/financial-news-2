China, the world’s biggest carbon
emitter, will pay 8.6 billion  yuan  ($1.4 billion) in subsidies
for electricity generated from renewable power this year.  Regional financial authorities will allocate the funds to
provincial and independent power-grid companies, according to a
Ministry of Finance  statement  posted on the central government’s
website. The government will provide 5.9 billion yuan for wind-
power and 2 billion yuan for biomass-energy projects, with the
rest subsidizing solar farms.  The move will bolster cash flows at  renewable-energy 
developers as the grid companies are required to use the capital
to pay the fixed and above-market tariffs of clean electricity
output they purchased in 2012.  The world’s second-biggest economy is deploying energy
generated from the sun, wind and biomass to help meet its target
of cutting  carbon emissions  by 17 percent per unit of gross
domestic product in its five-year plan through 2015. China wants
to have 100 gigawatts of wind, 21 gigawatts of solar and 13
gigawatts of biomass power installed by 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
