Germany ’s 10-year bonds fell for a
third day after an industry report showed business confidence in
the nation improved in December, damping demand for the region’s
safest assets.  Benchmark  bund yields  climbed to the highest level in three
weeks as European stocks joined a rally in shares around the
world.  Greek bonds  gained, with 10-year yields falling to the
lowest since the nation’s debt was restructured in March, after
Standard & Poor’s raised the country’s credit rating yesterday.
Italian, Spanish and Portuguese securities also advanced as
investors sought out higher-yielding investments.  “The latest print from the Ifo was a bit better than
expected and indicates there might be a stabilization,” said
Morten Hassing Povlsen, a senior rates analyst at Nordea Bank AB
in Copenhagen. “The market has taken the Ifo data with relief,
because it isn’t dropping more. Bund yields are rising toward
the late November highs.”  The German 10-year yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.43 percent at 4:53 p.m.  London  time after
climbing to 1.46 percent, the highest level since Nov. 27. The
1.5 percent bond due in September 2022 dropped 0.17, or 1.70
euros per 1,000-euro ($1,326) face amount, to 100.635.  Sentiment Improves  The Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on a
survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 102.4 from 101.4 in
November. That’s the second straight increase after sentiment
dropped to a 2 1/2-year low in October. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News predicted a gain to 102.  The Stoxx Euro 600  Index of shares  gained 0.4 percent and
the DAX Index of German shares increased to the highest in
nearly five years.  Greek bonds advanced for a third day after S&P raised the
nation’s rating to B- from selective default, citing the
“strong determination” of euro-area governments to keep the
nation in the currency bloc.  European officials last week approved the payout of 49.1
billion euros of loans through March from  Greece ’s bailout
programs with the European Union and International Monetary Fund
after receiving the results of the Greek bond buyback program.  Stable Outlook  “Greece finally stepped towards the light yesterday as
ratings agency S&P raised its credit rating,” Lee McDarby, head
of dealing on the corporate and institutional treasury desk at
Investec Bank Plc in London, wrote in a note to clients. “The
peripheral euro state was also given the stamp of having a
stable outlook driven by the strong determination of the
collective of euro-zone governments to keep the nation in the
shared currency.”  The yield on Greece’s 10-year bond dropped 109 basis points
to 11.73 percent, with the price climbing 3.90 to 48.99 percent
of face value. The rate plunged as much as 148 basis points to
11.33 percent.  Volatility on Belgian debt was the highest among euro-area
nations tracked by Bloomberg, followed by that of the Greece and
Ireland, according to measures of 10-year bonds, two- and 10-
year yield spreads and credit-default swaps.  Italian 10-year bond yields declined six basis points to
4.39 percent after falling to 4.35 percent, the lowest level
since December 2010. Spain’s 10-year rate fell four basis points
to 5.26 percent.  The yield on  Portugal ’s  10-year security  dropped below 7
percent for the first time since Feb. 4, 2011, sliding as much
as 10 basis points to 6.97 percent.  “A confidence rebound is enough to return the economy to
trend growth rates,” Christian Schulz, an economist at
Berenberg Bank in London wrote in a note to clients. “As
Germany starts growing again, chances for the euro-zone
periphery countries to export their way out of trouble also
improve markedly.”  German bunds returned 3.8 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
bonds gained 21 percent and Portugal’s rose 57 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
