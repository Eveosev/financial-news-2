LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) 
received a building permit to convert the defunct La Samaritaine
department-store in Paris into a hotel and said it will spend
450 million euros ($600 million) on the project.  The development, which includes commercial space, offices
social housing and a daycare center, will open at the end of
2015, LVMH said today in an e-mailed statement. The hotel will
be under the Cheval Blanc brand.  LVMH, which also owns the Le Bon Marche department store,
acquired La Samaritaine in 2001 and closed it in 2005, saying
the building was a fire hazard. The world’s largest maker of
 luxury goods  won approval in 2009 to convert the 143-year-old
structure into a hotel.  SANAA, a Tokyo-based architecture practice whose previous
projects include New York’s New Museum of Contemporary Art, was
appointed last year to design the renovation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
