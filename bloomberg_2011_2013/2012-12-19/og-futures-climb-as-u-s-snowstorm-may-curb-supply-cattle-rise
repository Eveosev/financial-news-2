Hog futures rose to a two-week high
on speculation that a U.S. winter storm will lower animal
weights and delay meat shipments. Cattle also climbed.  Blizzard conditions are forecast for tonight and tomorrow
with 2 inches to 5 inches (5 centimeters to 13 centimeters) of
snow expected in the Central Plains and as much as 15 inches in
parts of Iowa and  Wisconsin , Joel Widenor, a vice president for
Commodity Weather Group in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a
telephone interview. During cold, wet weather, livestock need to
use more energy to stay warm, leading to lower weights.  “Weather impeding livestock-weight gains and or
transportation of either moving the animal or moving the product
always sort of perks up the livestock markets,” Lawrence Kane,
a market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group, said in a telephone
interview from  Yates City ,  Illinois . “Some of the conditions
are going to get pretty tough on livestock.”  Hog futures for February settlement rose 1 percent to
86.125 cents a pound at 10:17 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching 86.475 cents, the highest for the most-
active contract since Dec. 3. Prices are up 1.2 percent this
year through yesterday.  Cattle futures for February delivery advanced 0.5 percent
to $1.33625 a pound. Yesterday, the price rallied to $1.3405,
the highest ever for the most-active contract.  Feeder-cattle futures for March settlement added 0.6
percent to $1.5535 a pound on the CME.  To contact the reporter on this story:
