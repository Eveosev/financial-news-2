The rand weakened for the first time
in four days against the dollar as investors bet the currency’s
advance to a two-month high was overdone.  South Africa ’s currency depreciated as much as 0.1 percent
and traded less than 0.1 percent lower at 8.4562 per dollar by
9:05 a.m. in Johannesburg. The rand reached 8.4354 per dollar
yesterday, the strongest since Oct. 4. Yields on benchmark 10.5
percent bonds due December 2026 were unchanged at 7.33 percent.  The rand has climbed 6 percent since reaching a three-and-
a-half year low of 9.0092 on Nov. 21 as European officials eased
terms for Greek aid and U.S. politicians took steps to resolve a
budget standoff. The currency gained 1.1 percent yesterday after
President  Jacob Zuma  was re-elected for a second term as
president of the country’s ruling  African National Congress  and
businessman  Cyril Ramaphosa  was elected deputy president,
boosting expectations of more investor-friendly policies.  “Markets can be content in the knowledge that someone who
understands business and the importance of delivery as playing a
key role,” Quinten Bertenshaw, a Johannesburg-based analyst at
ETM Analytics, said in e-mailed comments. “Technically, the
rand finds itself at a crucial point.”  The rand’s relative strength index against the dollar was
at 29.3 yesterday, below the 30 level that signals the currency
is overbought.  A stochastic oscillator for the rand versus the dollar was
also below the 30 threshold that signals the currency may have
advanced too quickly and is poised to fall. The measure, which
tracks the price of a security relative to its highs and lows
during a particular period, has been below 30 since Dec. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
