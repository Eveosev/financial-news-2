Argentina ’s biggest union groups
rallied outside the presidential palace in downtown Buenos Aires
to back demands for lower income  taxes  and a higher  minimum
wage .  The demonstration was organized by the General Labor
Confederation, the country’s biggest union umbrella group, and
the Public Workers Association. The opposition Civic Radical
Union party also backed the protest.  Union demands include an increase in the threshold at which
wages start to be taxed and an increase in the minimum salary to
3,500 pesos ($715) per month from the 2,875 pesos that the
government has announced for February 2013. After wages rose an
average 25 percent this year, in line with the inflation rate
estimated by private economists, more workers have become
subject to income taxes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
