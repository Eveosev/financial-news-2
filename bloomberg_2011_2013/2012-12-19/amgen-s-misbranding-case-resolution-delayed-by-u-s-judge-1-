A federal judge delayed his decision
on whether to approve an agreement to resolve a criminal charge
against  Amgen Inc. (AMGN)  for misbranding its anemia drug Aranesp.  The proposed settlement calls for the company to pay
$150 million in criminal penalties. Amgen, the world’s largest
biotechnology company, also would pay $612 million to settle
civil cases over its marketing practices, prosecutors said.  “I’m going to reserve and get back to you,” U.S. District
Judge Sterling Johnson told prosecutors in a hearing today in
 Brooklyn , New York. The judge said he may decide later today or
tomorrow.  U.S. prosecutors alleged the company promoted Aranesp for
uses not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration from
about 2001 through March 2007 to compete with  Johnson &
Johnson (JNJ) ’s anemia treatment Procrit.  Aranesp was approved to treat anemia caused by chronic
kidney failure and chemotherapy. Amgen marketed the drug for
larger, less frequent doses than indicated and for unapproved
use in patients with anemia caused by cancer, according to
prosecutors.  Amgen was estimated to have reaped about $85 million in
gains from misbranding Aranesp, Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger Burlingame said during the hearing. The company pleaded guilty
yesterday to a single misdemeanor misbranding charge over the
allegations.  “This is serious conduct but it is also misdemeanor
conduct,” Burlingame told the judge today.  The case is U.S. v. Amgen Inc., 1:12-cr-00760, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of  New York  (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
