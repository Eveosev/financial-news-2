U.S. stocks fell, pulling the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index down from a two-month high, as
 federal budget  negotiations deteriorated. Global equities
reached a 17-month high and the euro rose as German business
confidence grew.  The S&P 500 lost 0.8 percent to 1,435.81 at 4 p.m. in  New
York  after yesterday closing at the highest level since Oct. 18.
Trading volume was 6.6 percent above the 30-day average. The
 MSCI All-Country World Index (MXWD)  gained for a third day, rising 0.2
percent to the highest since July 2011. Ten-year Treasury yields
slipped two basis points to 1.80 percent after reaching an
almost two-month high yesterday. The euro touched an eight-month
high versus the dollar. Energy led commodities higher after U.S.
supply data.  House Speaker  John Boehner ’s “Plan B” would put “too big
a burden on the middle class” and President  Barack Obama  would
veto it, White House Communications Director  Dan Pfeiffer  said.
Boehner replied that Obama will be responsible for “the largest
tax increase in American history” if Democrats don’t accept the
measure the House plans to pass tomorrow.  “Markets continue to be very much focused on fiscal-cliff
resolution,”  Ryan Larson , the Chicago-based head of U.S. equity
trading at RBC Global Asset Management (U.S.) Inc., said in an
interview. His firm oversees $250 billion. “The move over the
last few days has been supported by optimism that a deal will be
reached by year-end. However, so far today we’re seeing a bit of
caution as congressional leaders remain at different ends on
several key issues.”  ‘Plan B’  The House may vote tomorrow on Boehner’s plan, which would
raise tax rates on income over $1 million, rather than the
$400,000 threshold the president proposed in his latest offer.
Boehner is looking to pressure Obama to accept deeper spending
cuts and a higher threshold for rate increases by showing how
tough it will be to win Republican support for any higher taxes.  The  S&P 500  snapped a two-day rally as health-care,
consumer-staples, utility and telephone shares  led losses  in all
of the 10 main industry groups. The S&P 500 has gained 14
percent this year and is up 1.4 percent so far in December after
the  Federal Reserve  extended its unprecedented monetary-stimulus
efforts and economic data improved.  An S&P gauge of  homebuilders  trimmed its loss to 0.9
percent after slumping as much as 2.2 percent. Commerce
Department data showed housing starts  fell 3 percent to a
861,000 annual rate from a revised 888,000 annual pace in

Bloomberg called for a drop to 872,000. Building permits, a
proxy for future construction, advanced to a four-year high.  Market Movers  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  slumped 3 percent as Moody’s Investors Service

bought by Getco LLC.  Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. and Sturm Ruger & Co.
rebounded after sliding for three days following a school
shooting in Newtown,  Connecticut , that killed 20 children and
six adults. Smith & Wesson rose 7.2 percent today after plunging
18 percent in the previous three sessions, its biggest drop in
three years. The stock had more than doubled this year before
the Dec. 14 shooting.  Obama said his administration will come up with “concrete
proposals” by next month to help stem gun violence and endorsed
restrictions on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity
ammunition clips. Obama said there is a growing consensus in the
country for restricting high-powered weapons and urged Congress
to hold votes on such measures early next year.  Oil Climbs  Oil rallied 1.8 percent to $89.51 a barrel, its highest

pounds ($472 million) Barclays Plc agreed to pay in June.  Germany’s Ifo institute’s business climate index, based on
a survey of 7,000 executives, climbed to 102.4 from 101.4 in

dropped to a 2 1/2-year low in October. Economists predicted a
reading of 102, according to the median of 43 forecasts in a
Bloomberg News survey.  Ten-year German bund yields rose to the highest level in
more than two weeks, advancing two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.43 percent. The euro was stronger against
