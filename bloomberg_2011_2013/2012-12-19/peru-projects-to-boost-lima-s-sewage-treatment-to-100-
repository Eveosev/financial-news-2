Lima  will treat 100 percent of the
wastewater produced in the capital city by 2015 compared with 16
percent now as two plants enter operation, Peru Housing,
Construction and Sanitation Minister Rene Cornejo said.  Sewage treatment will jump to 75 percent next year as the
 Taboada  plant by Spain’s  Actividades de Construccion y Servicios
SA  that started this week increases processing, Cornejo said
today in an interview with Lima’s Radio Programas.  The La Chira plant, to be built by  Acciona SA (ANA) ’s Acciona
Agua water unit and Peru’s  Grana y Montero SA (GRAMONC1) , will be ready by
the end of 2015 and will process 25 percent of the city’s
wastewater, the minister said.  Most of the sewage produced in Lima, home to more than 8
million people, flows into rivers and the sea without being
treated. The government will invest 1 billion soles ($390
million) next year on sanitation and drinking water supplies in
the capital, Cornejo also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
