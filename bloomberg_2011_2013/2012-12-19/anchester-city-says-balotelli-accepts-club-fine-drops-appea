English Premier League champion
Manchester City said Italy striker  Mario Balotelli  accepted a
two-week club fine and dropped an appeal against the punishment.  His lawyers were scheduled to put his case before a league
tribunal today. City, managed by Roberto Mancini, imposed the
fine of 340,000 pounds ($554,000) because of the player’s
indiscipline on the field last season, the Daily Mail reported.
The 22-year-old missed 11 competitive games during the campaign
through suspension after red cards.  “After amicable talks between the parties, as a sign of
respect for Roberto Mancini, the supporters and the club, Mario
Balotelli has chosen to accept a two-week fine levied upon him
by the club and withdraw his disciplinary appeal,” City said in
a statement. “Mario remains available for selection for all
forthcoming  fixtures.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
