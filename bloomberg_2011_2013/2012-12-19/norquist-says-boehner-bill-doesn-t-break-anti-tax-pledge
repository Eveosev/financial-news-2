House Speaker John Boehner’s
proposal to let tax cuts expire on annual income exceeding $1
million doesn’t break the anti-tax pledge most Republicans have
taken, said Americans for Tax Reform.  The group is led by Grover Norquist, author of the pledge.  “Republicans supporting this bill are this week affirming
to their constituents in writing that this bill--the sole
purpose of which is to prevent tax increases -- is consistent
with the pledge they made to them,” the group said. “It is
extremely difficult
-- if not impossible -- to fault these Republicans’ assertion.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
