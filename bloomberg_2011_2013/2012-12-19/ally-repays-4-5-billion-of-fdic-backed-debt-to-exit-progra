Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) , the auto lender
majority-owned by the U.S. government, repaid $4.5 billion of
debt backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to exit the
crisis-era program.  The debt was issued June 3, 2009 and matured today, the
Detroit-based company said today in a statement. Ally in October
had already repaid $2.9 billion issued under the program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
