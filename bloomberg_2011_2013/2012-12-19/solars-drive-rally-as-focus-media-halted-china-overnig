Chinese equities  in New York climbed
to a seven-month high after the  World Bank  boosted  China ’s 2013
economic growth forecast.  Focus Media Holding Ltd. (FMCN)  jumped after
agreeing to go private in China’s biggest leveraged buyout.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in New York added 0.4 percent to 97.14 yesterday,
the highest close since May 11. Focus Media climbed to an eight-
month high after agreeing to be bought by a  Carlyle Group (CG)  LP-led
consoritum for more than was offered in an initial offer.
 Suntech Power Holdings Ltd. (STP) , the world’s biggest solar-panel
maker, surged 18 percent and Internet stocks NetEase Inc. and
 Baidu Inc. (BIDU)  rallied.  The World Bank said  China’s economy  may “have bottomed
out” after a seven-quarter slowdown, raising its forecast for
2013 growth to 8.4 percent from an October projection of 8.1
percent, according to a report issued yesterday. The  Shanghai
Composite Index (SHCOMP)  lost 26 percent and the China-US gauge 15
percent in the seven quarters to the end of September amid
falling export demand from Europe and the U.S.  “The pick up in growth estimates gives the market some
excitement,” Michael Gayed, the chief investment strategist at
Pension Partners LLC, which advises on $150 million of assets,
said by phone from New York yesterday. “There’s more upside
room in China and  emerging markets  than in other areas in the
equity world.”  Focus Deal  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., retreated 0.2 percent from a
nine-month high to $39.48, trimming its gain this year to 13
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.8 percent to
1,435.81, from a two-month high reached the previous day, as the
White House threatened to veto a Republican plan for the U.S.
budget.  American depositary receipts of  Focus Media , which makes
ads for out-of-home electronic screens, jumped 6.7 percent to
$25.52, the highest level since April 12. The gain was the most
since Aug. 13.  The Shanghai-based company said it signed a definitive
agreement with a buyout group to take the company private at
$27.50 for each ADR, up from the $27 it was initially offered
Aug. 12. The deal values Focus Media’s equity at about $3.7
billion, the company said in a statement yesterday.  ‘Better Off’  Focus Media will be bought by a company that will be owned
by Chief Executive Officer Jason Nanchun Jiang, and a group of
private-equity investors including  Carlyle Group  after the
transaction is completed, according to the statement. The board
has approved the deal, which still needs approval from at least
two-thirds of shareholders and is scheduled to close in the
second quarter of 2013.  Focus Media, accused by short-seller Muddy Waters LLC of
overstating its ad network, joins a number of Chinese stocks
withdrawing from U.S. exchanges after concern about corporate
governance hit valuations. Since April 2010, 19 of the 49
companies intending to go private have completed the
transactions, while four have failed, according to a Nov. 5
report by  Roth Capital Partners .  Investors are “clearly better off” with Focus Media out
of U.S. capital markets, Muddy Waters founder  Carson Block  said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday relayed via Dukas Public
Relations.  “We note that many pension funds and endowments will
presumably be the new owners of this company when the deal
closes,” Block said. “Should Focus be unable to meet its
sizable debt obligations, we encourage regulators and fund
investors to ask hard questions about the rationale and due
diligence process underlying this purchase.”  Solar Surge  Suntech, based in China’s Jiangsu province, surged to
$1.26, the highest close since July.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the world’s
second-largest maker of solar wafers, based in Xinyu, China,
surged 13 percent to $1.43, the highest price since Aug. 23.  China will make regional adjustments to the so-called feed-
in tariffs, or prices paid for electricity for renewable energy
projects, according to a  statement  yesterday on the central
government’s website, which cited a State Council meeting led by
Premier  Wen Jiabao . The nation also will offer preferential tax
measures to photovoltaic projects, the government said.  The changes are among the latest efforts by the Chinese
government to help the industry cope with plunging prices and
profit margins caused by a solar panel supply glut. The Science
and Technology Ministry last week confirmed a second round of
subsidies to more than 100 developers of solar projects with
total capacity of 2.8 gigawatts.  Baidu, Sina  Guangzhou-based  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL)  advanced 9.3 percent to
$4.36. Yingli Green Energy Holding Co., based in Baoding, China,
climbed 7.1 percent to $2.42, the highest close since July 20.  The Chinese economy may expand 8.1 percent in 2013, up from
7.7 percent this year, according to the median of 48 economists’
estimates in a Bloomberg survey over the past week. The
government set a growth target of 7.5 percent for 2012.  NetEase (NTES) , operator of China’s second-largest online games
website, soared 6.3 percent to $41.95 in the steepest rally
since June 6. Trading volume of its ADRs was almost three times
the daily average over the past three months, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Baidu, owner of China’s biggest search engine, rose 2.1
percent to a one-month high of $100.58.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  gained 0.8 percent
yesterday to 11,388.40, the highest level in nine months,
contributing to a 15 percent advance in 2013. The Shanghai
Composite was little changed at 2,162.24, and is down 1.7
percent in 2012.  The China-US measure has gained 7.9 percent this year,
after sliding 17 percent in 2011.  Thirty-day volatility  on the
index fell to 17.6 yesterday, compared with a 2012 average of
22, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The  Bloomberg Chinese Reverse Mergers Index (CHINARTO) , which tracks a
basket of companies that gained U.S. listings after buying firms
that already trade, dropped 0.5 percent to 74.93 in a second day
of declines. The gauge has risen 1.6 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
