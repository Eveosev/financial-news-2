The Canadian dollar declined against
its U.S. peer for a second day as U.S. negotiations over the so-
called fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts set to
start in January remain unresolved.  Canada’s currency traded in the tightest range against the
greenback since July 4 as U.S. House Speaker  John Boehner 
offered a backup plan as he seeks compromise between fellow
Republicans and the government. The Canadian dollar declined
against the euro as German business confidence increased for a
second month in December, signaling  Europe ’s largest economy may
support a euro-area recovery next year.  “The Canadian dollar appears to be the currency of choice
for those looking to hedge fiscal-cliff risk,”  Camilla Sutton ,
head of currency strategy at  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS) , said by phone
from Toronto. “If business confidence is improving, that’s
likely positive for the German economy and that’s also helped
support the euro.”  The loonie, as the Canadian currency is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, declined 0.1 percent to
98.67 cents at 8:32 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0125.  Canada’s dollar fell 0.7 percent against the euro to
1.3111, its second daily decline.  The House may vote tomorrow on Boehner’s “Plan B,” which
would raise tax rates on income over $1 million, rather than the
$400,000 threshold the president proposed in his latest offer.
The Obama administration and Democrats rejected the Boehner
plan, released yesterday, as inadequate. The U.S. is Canada’s
biggest trade partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
