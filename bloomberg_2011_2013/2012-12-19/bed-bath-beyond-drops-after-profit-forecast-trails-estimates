Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (BBBY) , the operator
of more than 1,400 home-furnishing stores, declined in extended
trading after projecting full-year profit that trailed analysts’
estimates.  Bed Bath & Beyond fell 3.6 percent to $58.10 at 4:55 p.m.
in extended trading after the announcement. The shares had
gained 4 percent this year through today’s New York close.  Profit will be $4.48 to $4.54 a share this year, the Union,
New Jersey-based retailer said today in a statement. Analysts
projected $4.62, the average of 25 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company also announced a plan to repurchase $2.5
billion in its shares after the completion of its existing
program, which began in December 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
