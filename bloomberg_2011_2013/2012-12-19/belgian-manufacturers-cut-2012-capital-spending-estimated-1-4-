Belgian manufacturers reduced
capital spending by an estimated 1.4 percent this year,
according to the National Bank of  Belgium ’s semi-annual survey.  The decline compares with a projection of a 17 percent
increase six months ago and follows an estimated 10 percent gain
in 2011. Spending is projected to rebound 14 percent next year,
the Brussels-based central bank said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The downward revision in the 2012 estimate “reflects a
difficult context marked by an unfavorable trend in demand
forecasts in the second half of the year, both on the domestic
market and on foreign markets,” according to the bank. Next
year will benefit from “a brighter outlook on the export
markets,” it said.  For 2012, “there appears to have been a decline in
virtually all branches of activity, with the exception of the
car manufacturing, non-ferrous metals, cement, paper and board
industries as well as the clothing industry,” the central bank
said. “Small and medium-sized enterprises seem to have been
affected the most.”  Capital spending  by the manufacturing industry accounts for
about 16 percent of total investment by Belgian companies,
according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
