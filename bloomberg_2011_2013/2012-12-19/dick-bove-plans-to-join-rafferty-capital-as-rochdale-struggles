Dick Bove, the bank analyst whose
employer, Rochdale Securities LLC, is struggling to survive
after an unauthorized $1 billion  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  trade, will join
Rafferty Capital Markets LLC.  Bove, 71, will lead research in financial services
companies,  Garden City , New York-based Rafferty said today in an
e-mailed statement. Speculation about Bove’s status swirled
after regulators ordered Stamford, Connecticut-based Rochdale to
halt operations because of losses on Apple and five traders
jumped to Rafferty.  “The firm is well-established and has a commitment to
independent research, the type I’ve enjoyed producing for many
years,” Bove said in the statement.  Rochdale President Dan Crowley has struggled to hold onto
his staff while seeking a deal to keep his 37-year-old brokerage
afloat. Bove said previously that he wouldn’t leave until
Crowley “threw in the towel” on finding a rescuer. Crowley
didn’t respond to inquiries about the firm’s fate.  To contact the reporters on this story:
