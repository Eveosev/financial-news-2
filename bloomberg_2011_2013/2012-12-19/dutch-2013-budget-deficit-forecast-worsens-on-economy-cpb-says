The Dutch  budget deficit  will narrow
less than previously forecast next year as the euro area’s
fifth-biggest economy shrinks and unemployment increases,
government planning agency CPB said.  The deficit will be 3.3 percent of gross domestic product
in 2013, after a shortfall of 3.8 percent in 2012, CPB said in
economic forecasts released today in  The Hague . That would
exceed the European Union’s 3 percent limit and is wider than
the 2.7 percent the agency predicted on Sept. 18. It also said
that the economy will keep shrinking next year.  “The Dutch economy has already been contracting for a year
and a half,” CPB said in a statement. “Only in the second half
of 2013 will the economy recover slightly.”  The Dutch central bank was more pessimistic on Dec. 10,
when it predicted a deficit of 4.1 percent for this year and a
shortfall of 3.5 percent for 2013 and 2014. Finance Minister
Jeroen Dijsselbloem said then that he does not exclude
additional budget cuts. The coalition of the Liberal party and
Labor, sworn in on Nov. 5, is planning budget cuts of about 16
billion euros ($21 billion) in the next four years.  The economy will contract 0.5 percent in 2013 after
shrinking 1 percent this year, CPB said. It predicted
unemployment will increase to 6 percent in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
