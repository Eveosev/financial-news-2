UBS AG (UBSN)  will pay $700 million in
fines to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission as part
of $1.5 billion settlement for rigging global interest rates,
according to  Bart Chilton , a Democratic commissioner.  The fine outlined by Chilton in a statement today is the
largest in CFTC history and follows the Washington-based
agency’s $200 million penalty on Barclays Plc for attempted
manipulation of the London interbank offered rate.  “The UBS settlement is serious and significant and will
provide a definite deterrent,” Bart Chilton, one of three
Democrats on the CFTC, said in a statement. UBS continued
wrongdoing even after investigations began and had a “corrupt
culture,” Chilton said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
