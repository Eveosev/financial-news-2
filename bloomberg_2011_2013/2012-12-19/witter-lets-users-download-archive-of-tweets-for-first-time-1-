Twitter Inc., the social-networking
company that features 140-character status updates, is letting
users download an archive of posts to make its site more
alluring as competition with Facebook Inc. escalates.  The move is designed to make it easier to view tweets by
month or search for certain words and phrases, the San
Francisco-based company said today on its  blog .  Twitter is adding tools to help it win Web surfers and
advertising dollars from social-networking rival Facebook. The
archiving feature comes a week after the company unveiled color
filtering for photos uploaded to applications for Apple Inc.
iPhones and Google Inc. Android phones. The move may help it
compete with Facebook’s Instagram, which earlier in the month
had made it harder for users to display their photos on Twitter.  Starting today, some people can request their archive of
tweets by pressing a button in Twitter’s settings. The option
will become available to all users in the coming months, the
company said.  Facebook began to encourage its members to relive memories
on the social network last year, when it introduced the
“Timeline” profile for viewing photos and events from the
past.  To contact the reporter on this story:
