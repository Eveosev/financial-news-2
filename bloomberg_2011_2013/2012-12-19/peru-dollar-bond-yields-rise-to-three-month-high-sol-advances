  Peru ’s dollar-denominated bonds
fell, pushing up yields to a three-month high, as U.S. lawmakers
struggled to reach a budget compromise, discouraging demand for
emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s 7.35 percent dollar-denominated
bond due in July 2025 rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 3.03 percent at 1:25 p.m. in Lima,
according to Bloomberg prices. That is the highest since Sept.
21. The bond’s price fell 0.40 cent to 144.87 cents per dollar.  The U.S., Peru’s biggest trading partner after China, faces
$607 billion in automatic spending cuts and tax increases
scheduled to take effect starting Jan. 1 if President Barack
Obama and Congress can’t agree on a plan to avoid them.  “There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done,” said
 Roberto Flores , the head of research at Inteligo SAB, a Lima-
based brokerage. “This is the big issue, the driver that will
determine how markets perform through year-end.”  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5615 per U.S. dollar,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  House Speaker  John Boehner ’s budget plan would put “too
big a burden on the middle class” and the president would veto
it, White House Communications Director  Dan Pfeiffer  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
