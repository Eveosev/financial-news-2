The  New York Yankees  re-signed
outfielder  Ichiro Suzuki , a 10-time All-Star and 10-time Gold
Glove winner for his defensive prowess, to a two-year contract.  Suzuki, a  Major League Baseball  All-Star every year from
2001 to 2010 while playing for the  Seattle Mariners , was traded
to New York in July and hit .322 with five home runs, 27 runs
batted in and 14 stolen bases in 67 games with the Yankees.  Contract details weren’t given by the Yankees in a  news
release  announcing the agreement last night. The deal is for a
total of $12 million to $13 million and Suzuki, 39, turned down
bigger offers from other clubs as a free agent, ESPN cited an
unidentified person in baseball who was briefed on the
negotiations as saying last week.  “I believe the Yankees organization appreciates that there
is a difference between a 39-year-old who has played relying
only on talent, and a 39-year-old who has prepared, practiced
and thought thoroughly through many experiences for their
craft,” Suzuki said in the statement. “I am very thankful, and
I will do my best to deliver on their expectations.”  Suzuki, a left-handed hitter, has a .322 career batting
average and ranks second among active players with 452 stolen
bases, trailing only Juan Pierre’s 591 steals. He has 2,606
career hits, having recorded at least 150 hits in each of his
first 12 seasons in the major leagues.  The 2001 American League Rookie of the Year and Most
Valuable Player after coming to Seattle from Japan, Suzuki is a
two-time AL batting champion and has led or tied for the major
league lead in hits seven times to tie  Pete Rose  and Ty Cobb for
the career record.  To contact the reporter on this story:
