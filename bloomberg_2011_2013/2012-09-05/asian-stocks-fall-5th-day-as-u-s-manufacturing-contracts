Asian  stocks  fell a fifth day, with
the regional benchmark index headed for the longest losing
streak in two months, as economic reports from the U.S. to  China 
and Australia stoked concern global growth is slowing.  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , South Korea’s largest exporter of
consumer electronics that gets 20 percent of its revenue in
America, lost 2.4 percent in Seoul.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) ,
Australia’s No. 2 lender by market value, slid 1.5 percent in
Sydney as the country’s economy grew at a slower-than-estimated
rate. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., Australia’s third-biggest
iron-ore producer, plunged 8.5 percent as prices of the
steelmaking material fell to a three-year low on slowing growth
in China.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.3 percent to 115.74
as of 7:15 p.m. in  Tokyo , heading for the longest losing streak
since the period ended July 12. More than four stocks declined
for each that advanced on the gauge. Volatility across the
region gained before the  European Central Bank  meets tomorrow.  “The macro backdrop is quite challenging and growth
conditions are fragile obviously,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-
based head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP Capital Investors
Ltd., which manages almost $100 billion. “The market is getting
nervous about going into the ECB meeting. There’s a lot of
speculation on the ECB about what they will do.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed this quarter
through yesterday as expectations for further stimulus measures
overshadowed signs of a global economic slowdown. The Asian
benchmark traded at 12.3 times estimated earnings as of last
week, compared with 13.6 times for the  Standard & Poor’s 500
Index (SPXL1)  and 11.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  Australian Growth  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.6 percent after a report
showed the nation’s economy slowed more in the second quarter
than economists expected. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index dropped 0.2
percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.1 percent,
while South Korea’s  Kospi Index (KOSPI)  slid 1.7 percent.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index  fell 1.5 percent. The Shanghai
Composite Index lost 0.3 percent after the HSBC China Services
PMI fell to 52.0 in August from 53.1 in July.  Taiwan’s Taiex
Index (TWSE)  lost 1.1 percent and Singapore’s Straits Times Index slid
0.5 percent.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.5 percent
today. The index declined 0.1 percent in New York yesterday,
when the  Institute for Supply Management ’s U.S. factory  index 
showed U.S. manufacturing shrank for a third month in August,
the longest decline since the recession ended in 2009.  Exporters to the U.S. declined. Samsung Electronics dropped
2.4 percent to 1.189 million won.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of
toys and clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell 2.5 percent to
HK$11.62 in Hong Kong.  Banks Slip  Australian shares fell after the government reported the
nation’s economy grew 0.6 percent last quarter from the previous
three months. That missed a 0.7 percent expansion forecast by
economists surveyed by Bloomberg and was less than half the 1.3
percent pace in the first quarter.  Westpac fell 1.5 percent to A$23.95.  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia , the nation’s biggest lender by market value, slid 0.2
percent to A$54.55.  Volatility across the region rose as investors awaited
developments out of Europe.  Mario Draghi , president of the
European Central Bank, said the central bank’s primary mandate
compels it to intervene in bond markets to wrest back control of
 interest rates  and ensure the euro’s survival. His comments came
before the ECB’s Governing Council is due to decide on his bond-
buying proposal tomorrow.  ’Melting Pot’  “You throw everything into the melting pot, and that’s why
you get this volatility on a day-to-day basis,” said Cameron Peacock, a Melbourne-based market analyst at IG Markets, a
provider of trading services for stocks, bonds and currencies.
“You’ve got people positioning themselves ahead of these
announcements. Some people are happy to get in there and
position themselves for risk. Some people say, ‘Not for me and I
will sit on the sidelines and wait and see what happens.’”  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  gained 3 percent
to 20.69, indicating traders expect a swing of about 5.9 percent
on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Measures of
anticipated price movements for the Hang Seng Index, the S&P/ASX
200 Index and the Kospi 200 Index also climbed.  Material and energy shares dropped the most on the Asia-
Pacific benchmark equity gauge today. Iron-ore prices plummeted
24 percent in August, the most in 10 months, sliding to $88.70 a
metric ton on Aug. 30, the lowest since Oct. 30, 2009. The
prices fell on concern slowing growth in China, the biggest
buyer, will curb demand.  Fortescue Metals lost 8.5 percent to A$3.12 after yesterday
cutting its full-year  capital spending  forecast by 26 percent to
$4.6 billion. The shares had biggest drop on the Asian benchmark
measure. Sundance Resources Ltd., the target of a takeover by
China’s Sichuan Hanlong Group, slumped 13 percent to 26.5
Australian cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
