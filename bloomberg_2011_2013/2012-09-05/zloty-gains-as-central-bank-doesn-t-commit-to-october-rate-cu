The zloty advanced for the first
time in three days after  Poland ’s central bank didn’t signal it
will cut  interest rates  next month.  The zloty gained 0.4 percent to 4.1796 per euro as of 5:39
p.m. in Warsaw, reversing an earlier drop to a six-week low. The
yield on two-year notes rose 4 basis points to 4.07 percent,
snapping five days of declines.  The central bank today kept borrowing costs unchanged for a
fourth month at 4.75 percent, the highest level since 2009, even
after the economy expanded at the weakest pace in almost three
years. While Governor  Marek Belka  said in a subsequent news
conference that policy makers were “open” to cutting rates,
his comment wasn’t a “clear” announcement of a reduction in
October, Wojciech Matysiak, an economist at Bank Pekao SA, wrote
in an e-mailed comment.  “The market was a little surprised having priced in a
small probability of a cut at this meeting,” Peter Attard Montalto, an economist at Nomura Holdings Inc. said in a
comment. “There may well have been a greater amount of surprise
for the market around the lack of pre-commitment” to a cut next
month, he said.  Investors pared their expectation for a reduction in
borrowing costs on Oct 3. One month forward-rate agreements are
today trading 19 basis points below three-month Warsaw Interbank
Offered Rate, compared with 20 basis points yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
