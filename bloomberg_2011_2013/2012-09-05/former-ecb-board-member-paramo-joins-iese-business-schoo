Former European Central Bank
Executive Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo has joined
Spain’s IESE business school.  Gonzalez-Paramo, 54, will be a visiting professor in the
economics department, the University of Navarre’s business
school said in an e-mailed statement today in  Madrid .  The Spaniard, whose term at the Frankfurt-based bank ended
this year, previously sat on the Bank of Spain’s board and was a
professor of public finance at Complutense University in Madrid.
While at the ECB he called on Spain to rein in spending and
overhaul labor rules and Spanish media cited him as a possible
candidate to lead the Bank of Spain or the Economy Ministry when
Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  came to power in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
