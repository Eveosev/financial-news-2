The European Commission is seeking
views on possible rules to overhaul Libor, Euribor and other so-
called market benchmarks in the wake of the scandal over
interbank lending rates.  European Union regulators are weighing options such as
forcing  banks  to provide real transaction data rather than
estimates and increasing the number of lenders involved in the
rate setting, according to an e-mailed statement from the
commission.  It’s “essential that steps are taken to ensure the
integrity of benchmarks,”  Michel Barnier , the EU’s financial
services chief, said in a statement. “The international
investigations under way into the manipulation of Libor have
revealed yet another example of unacceptable behavior by
banks.”  Confidence in Libor, the benchmark  interest rate  for more
than $500 trillion of securities, plummeted following  Barclays
Plc (BARC) ’s admission that it submitted false rates. The revelations
have provoked renewed calls for tougher oversight of the
financial system and pushed regulatory probes of interbank
lending rates to the top of the political agenda.  Barclays, the U.K.’s second-largest bank by assets, was
fined 290 million pounds ($460 million) in June for its role in
rigging Libor for profit. Chairman Marcus Agius, Chief Executive
Officer  Robert Diamond  and Chief Operating Officer Jerry Del
Missier subsequently resigned.  The commission will seek views on possible measures until
Nov. 15, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
