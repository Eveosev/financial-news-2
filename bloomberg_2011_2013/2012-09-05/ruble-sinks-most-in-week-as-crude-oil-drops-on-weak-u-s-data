The ruble strengthened for a second
day, erasing earlier losses, before the  European Central Bank 
meets tomorrow to decide on its bond-buying plan.  The ruble advanced less than 0.1 percent to 32.2900 at 7
p.m. in Moscow after falling as much as 0.6 percent.  Russia ’s
currency was 0.3 percent weaker versus the euro at 40.7074 and
retreated 0.1 percent against the central bank’s target euro-
dollar basket.  ECB President  Mario Draghi ’s bond-buying proposal involves
unlimited purchases of government debt that will be sterilized
to assuage concerns about printing money, two central bank
officials briefed on the plan said. The ECB’s Governing
Council will decide tomorrow on bond-buying plans.  Investors pared bets the ruble will weaken further, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 32.7470 per dollar
in three months, compared with 32.7590 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell four basis points to 216,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields compiled by the Micex fell
more than two basis points to 7.606 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
