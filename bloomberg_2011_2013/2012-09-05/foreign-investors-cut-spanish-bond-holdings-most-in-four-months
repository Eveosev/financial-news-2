Non-resident investors  offloaded
Spanish bonds at the fastest pace in four months in July as the
debt crisis intensified.  They reduced their holdings to 173.1 billion euros ($218
billion), or 34.8 percent of the total, from 182.1 billion
euros, or 36.1 percent, in June, the debt agency said on
its website today. Their share of all bonds and bills fell to
34.1 percent from 35.2 percent as Spanish banks increased their
share to 32.3 percent from 30.9 percent.  Spain  is losing foreign investment at the quickest pace
since the start of the euro as the failure to stem the sovereign
debt crisis fuels expectations it will be the next nation to
seek a full bailout. The exit has sent stocks to 2003 levels and
borrowing costs to record highs, while European Central Bank
data show private-sector deposits fell the most on record in
July.  --Andrew Atkinson, Leon Mangasarian  To contact the reporter on this story:
