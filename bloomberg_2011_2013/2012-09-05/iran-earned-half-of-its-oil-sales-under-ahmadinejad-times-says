Almost half of the oil revenue  Iran 
earned in the past 103 years has been during the presidency of
 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , former deputy Oil Minister Akbar Torkan
said, according to a report in the  Tehran Times .  About 47 percent of the $1.1 trillion in revenue was earned
after Ahmadinejad was first elected in 2005, Torkan said in the
report. World oil prices more than doubled from 2005, tripling
at one point as the fuel increased to a record in 2008.  Iraq overtook Iran in June as the second-largest producer
in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, figures
from the group show. Iran pumped 2.75 million barrels of oil a
day in August, 350,000 barrels less than in July, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Output has shrunk amid sanctions
imposed by the U.S., European Union and  United Nations .  To contact the reporter on this story:
