Western Refining Inc. (WNR)  entered into a
long-term commercial supply and trading agreement with  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN)  that will allow Western to expand its mid-
Atlantic wholesale business.  Westernâ€™s York River Fuels unit and Glencore will be able
to provide fuel products to customers from southern Georgia to
northern Maryland from a Savannah, Georgia, terminal with the
capacity to hold more than 450,000 barrels of gasoline,
distillates, ethanol and other biofuels and fuel blends, the
companies said in a statement.  Glencore obtained the storage capacity from Epic Terminals,
the companies said. Glencore, a Baar, Switzerland-based
commodities producer and marketer, will provide global sourcing,
supply and trading and inventory and risk management services to
Western, a refiner and marketer based in El Paso, Texas.  Western, which operates refineries in El Paso and Gallup,
 New Mexico , will provide rack marketing and contract and credit
management through the York River unit, the companies said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
