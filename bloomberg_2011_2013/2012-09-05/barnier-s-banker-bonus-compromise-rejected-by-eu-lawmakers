European Parliament lawmakers
rejected a compromise proposal on measures to regulate banker
bonuses, saying the plans are too weak.  Legislators rejected the proposal, advocated by European
Union Financial Services Commissioner  Michel Barnier , during a
meeting today on a draft Basel bank-capital law, said Philippe
Lamberts, the lawmaker leading the work on the measures for the
parliament’s Green group.  While EU lawmakers have called for a ban on bonuses that
exceed fixed pay, governments are concerned that the measure may
harm competitiveness. Barnier has advocated an alternative
approach based on empowering shareholders.  Members of the parliament at the meeting said that the
compromise plan “wasn’t even a basis to start discussions,”
Lamberts said in an interview in Brussels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
