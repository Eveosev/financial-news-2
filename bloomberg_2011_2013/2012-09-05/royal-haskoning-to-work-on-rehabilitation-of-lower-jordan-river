Friends of the Earth  Middle East 
hired a Dutch company to put together a plan to help
rehabilitate the Lower Jordan River after receiving a 3 million-
euro ($3.8 million) grant from the European Union,  The river’s ecosystem is threatened by excessive water
diversion for agriculture and other industries, development by
Israel, Syria and Jordan as well as pollution, the environmental
group said in a report.  Royal Haskoning, which won a tender for about 839,000
euros, this week started work with a group including Jordanians,
Israelis and Palestinians that will present the rehabilitation
plan for the Lower Jordan by 2014, FOEME said on its website.  “They will prepare a computerized model of all water
extraction from the river and all of the springs,” said Gidon
Bromberg, head of FOEME  Israel .  To contact the reporter on this story:
