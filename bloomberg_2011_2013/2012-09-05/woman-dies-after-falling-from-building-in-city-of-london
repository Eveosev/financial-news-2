A woman died after falling from a
roof terrace bar located near the  Bank of England  in the  City of
London  financial district yesterday, according to local police.  “A woman was seen to fall from a building” at about 6:30
p.m. on a road known as Poultry, the City of London police said
in an e-mailed statement today. “She was subsequently
pronounced dead at the scene. Police are investigating the
circumstances of her death.”  Police declined to name the woman who died. The death
occurred at the same building where 24-year-old Deutsche Bank AG
stockbroker Anjool Malde fell to his death on July 5 2009.  A person who answered the phone at the site today declined
to comment and referred calls to the police.  To contact the reporter on this story:
