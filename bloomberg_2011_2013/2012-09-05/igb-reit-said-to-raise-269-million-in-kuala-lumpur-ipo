IGB Real Estate Investment Trust (IGBREIT) ,
owner of two of Kuala Lumpur’s biggest shopping malls, raised
837.5 million ringgit ($269 million) in an initial public
offering after pricing units at the top of a marketed range,
said three people with knowledge of the matter.  The trust, an arm of Malaysian property developer  IGB Corp. (IGB) ,
sold units to institutional investors at 1.25 ringgit each, said
the people, asking not to be identified as the information is
private. IGB had marketed the shares at 1.15 ringgit to 1.25
ringgit apiece. Demand exceeded supply by more than 30 times at
the top of the range, said one other person familiar with the
matter who declined to be identified.  IGB REIT is joining a resurgence in IPOs in  Kuala Lumpur 
where the benchmark FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index rose to a
record this week. Palm-oil producer  Felda Global Ventures
Holdings Bhd. (FGV)  raised $3.3 billion in June, and hospital operator
 IHH Healthcare Bhd. (IHH)  sold $2 billion of stock in July.  The trust owns the Gardens Mall and Mid Valley Megamall,
which it acquired from IGB Corp. subsidiary  KrisAssets Holdings
Bhd. (KRIS)  It will generate distributable income of 108.7 million
ringgit this year, which is expected to rise to 230.5 million
ringgit in 2013, according to the offering prospectus.  IGB REIT’s offering comes after  Pavilion Real Estate
Investment Trust (PREIT) , another Kuala Lumpur shopping-center owner,
raised 710 million ringgit in an IPO in November 2011. Pavilion
REIT is up about  50 percent  from its offer price.  CIMB Group Holdings Bhd. (CIMB) , Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd.
and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  are joint lead managers for IGB
REIT’s offering.  To contact the reporters on this story:
