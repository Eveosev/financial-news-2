The naira snapped three days of
declines on inflows and on bets the  central bank  will support
the currency as reserves increased.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer climbed 0.1
percent to 158.38 per dollar as of 3:35 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital. The naira has climbed 2.5 percent this year,
the second-best performer in Africa, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  will sell 142.9 billion naira
($903 million) of 91-day, 182-day and 364-day treasury bills at
an auction today, it said on Aug. 29. Nigeria’s foreign-currency
reserves have risen 18 percent this year to $38.9 billion,
according to Aug. 31 data compiled by the central bank. The
regulator sold $200 million at a foreign currency auction today,
unchanged from the previous sale on Sept. 3, it said in an e-
mailed statement.  “The naira is strengthened by foreign investments into
treasury bills and the expectation that the central bank will
support the currency against the backdrop of rising foreign
exchange reserves,” Edgar Ebinum, analyst at Lagos-based Cowry
Asset Management Ltd., said in a telephone interview today.  The yield on  Nigeria ’s 7 percent domestic bonds due 2019
rose 44 basis points to 13.96 percent, according to Sept. 4 data
on the Financial Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on
the nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 fell three basis
points to 4.9 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi rose 0.2 percent to 1.9315 a dollar in Accra,
the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
