The Michigan  Supreme Court  ordered
that a proposal to make collective bargaining a constitutional
right be placed on the ballot in the November election.  Opponents sought to have the proposed amendment to the
state constitution barred from consideration by Michigan voters,
contending it conflicts with other provisions of the
Constitution including the Legislature’s right to enact laws
governing the resolution of disputes concerning public
employees.  The court today said it saw no conflict between the
proposed amendment and the existing constitution, and ruled that
proponents of the measure had collected enough signatures to put
it to a vote.  “The Legislature may still enact the laws provided for”
in the sections of the constitution cited by opponents, the
court said. “But should the amendment pass, the power to do so
could be limited by collective-bargaining agreements.”  The state’s high court also ordered onto the ballot a
proposed amendment that would require a statewide majority vote,
or a two-thirds vote of both houses of the Legislature, to raise
taxes or enact a new tax.  The court also approved for referendum a proposal to
require a popular vote before any international bridge could be
built between Michigan and  Canada .  The court rejected a fourth measure, which sought an
amendment to allow the construction of eight new casinos in the
state.  The collective bargaining case is Protect Our Jobs v. Board
of State Canvassers, 145748, Michigan Supreme Court (Lansing).  To contact the reporter on this story:
