Shawcor Ltd. (SCL/A) , which provides
coatings and other services to the pipeline industry, is
considering selling itself with the support of its controlling
shareholder.  Chairman Virginia Shaw told the board she is prepared to
sell her shares as part of a sale of the company, the Toronto-
based company said in a statement today. Shaw is the controlling
shareholder through a holding company, Shawcor said.  The board has formed a committee to consider a sale and
other alternatives, according to the statement. No buyers have
been identified.  Shawcor has hired Credit Suisse Canada as a financial
advisor. The statement was issued after the close of regular
trading. Shawcor rose 0.5 percent to C$35.08 at the close in
Toronto.  Shaw was elected board chairman in 2007, following the
death of her father, Leslie Shaw.  To contact the reporter on this story:
