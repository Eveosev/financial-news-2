A judge of  Germany ’s Federal
Constitution Court set to rule on bids to halt the country’s
participation in the European Stability Mechanism is biased and
should be removed from the group ruling on the case on Sept. 12,
a plaintiff has claimed.  Judith Blohm, a spokeswoman for the Federal Constitution
Court, said an emergency appeal that judge Peter Huber be
removed from the case has been received. Welt newspaper reported
the information earlier.  Huber’s former work for “Mehr Demokratie e.V.,” an
organization that has initiated constitutional complaints
against Germany participating in the ESM, makes him biased, Welt
cited the plaintiff as claiming.  To contact the reporters on this story:
