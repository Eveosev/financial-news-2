Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA , Brazil’s second-largest steelmaker, jumped the most in
almost four years after Latin America’s biggest economy boosted
import taxes on some products including steel.  Usiminas, as the  Belo Horizonte , Brazil-based company is
known,  gained  18 percent to 9.52 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo, the biggest increase since Sept. 19, 2008.  Gerdau SA (GGBR4) , the
largest Brazilian steelmaker, and Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA,
the country’s third-biggest, also rose.  Brazil raised the import tariff on some flat and long-steel
products to 25 percent from 10 percent to boost the domestic
 steel industry , the country’s trade ministry said yesterday in a
 statement . The measure benefits Usiminas the most because it’s
the steelmaker with the highest import exposure, Marcos Assumpcao and Andre Pinheiro, analysts for Banco Itau BBA SA,
said in an note today.  “Brazilian companies will benefit from higher realized
domestic prices in the short term,” wrote the analysts, who
upgraded the stock to the equivalent of neutral. “Sixty percent
of Usiminas’ revenues are exposed to the announced increase in
import tariff, while CSN and Gerdau’s exposures are smaller, 30
percent and 5 percent, respectively.”  CSN  rose  8.2 percent to 10.34 reais, the biggest climb
since August 2011. Gerdau increased 2.6 percent to 18.28 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
