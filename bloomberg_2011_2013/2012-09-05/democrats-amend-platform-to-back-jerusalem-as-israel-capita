Democrats meeting at their national
convention today in  Charlotte , North Carolina, amended their
party’s platform to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of
Israel.  After three voice votes, the delegates agreed to restore
language from the party’s 2008 platform, which said, “Jerusalem
is and will remain the capital of Israel.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
