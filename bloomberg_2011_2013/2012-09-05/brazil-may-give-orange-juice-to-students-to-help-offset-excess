The Brazilian government is studying
providing free  orange juice  in the country’s public schools, as
is done in the producing state of  Sao Paulo , to offset excess
production from two good crops, a government official said.  “Almost 98 percent of our production is exported, but we
came up with an excess production from the last two crops,”
Jose Carlos Vaz, executive secretary at  Agriculture Ministry ,
said today in a phone interview from Brasilia. “It’s surprising
that being the world’s largest producer, we have so little
consumption in Brazil.”  “We expect an increase of 10,000 tons of oranges per year
in consumption and we hope that in two years we can fully meet
the excess offer with the increased demand,” Vaz said.  Orange-juice inventories held by the world’s top three
producers tripled to 662,452 metric tons on June 30, an CitrusBr
industry association said on Aug. 28. Stockpiles compare with
214,000 tons a year ago, CitrusBr said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
