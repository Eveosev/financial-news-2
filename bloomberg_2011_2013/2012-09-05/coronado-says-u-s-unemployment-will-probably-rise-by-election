Julia Coronado , chief economist for
 North America  at BNP Paribas in New York, said the U.S. jobless
rate will probably remain higher than 8 percent until the Nov. 6
presidential election and is more likely to rise than to fall.  “Certainly with the economy growing at the pace it seems
to be growing, we would be more likely to see the unemployment
rate tick up than to move lower,” Coronado said today in an
interview on Bloomberg Radio’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .
“Right now, we are very much treading water in growth, in the
labor market.”  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  last week made the
case for further monetary easing to reduce an  unemployment rate 
stuck above 8 percent for more than three years, a situation he
called a “grave concern.” The government will report later
this week that the economy added 127,000 jobs in August, slowing
from a gain of 163,000 in July, while the jobless rate remained
at 8.3 percent for a second consecutive month, according to the
median estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Coronado said she agreed Bernanke that most joblessness has
been caused by weak demand rather than structural changes in the
economy, such as a mismatch of jobs and worker skills.  “The only real way to bring unemployment down is to have
stronger growth,” she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
