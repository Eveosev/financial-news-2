Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  was sued by
German lender Bayerische Landesbank and accused of fraud over
losses on mortgage-backed securities.  BayernLB, which bought about $511.9 million in securities
in 16 offerings that Goldman Sachs underwrote, said the
securities were riskier than promised and were “destined to
fail,” according to a complaint filed yesterday in New York
State Supreme Court.  “BayernLB has suffered significant losses as a result of
Goldman Sachs’s fraud,” the lender said.  Goldman Sachs and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  were sued separately
yesterday in the same court over mortgage bonds by  IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG. (IKB)  IKB, a German lender, said it sold $137.4
million in Citigroup securities and $73.2 million in Goldman
Sachs securities at a loss.  UBS AG, based in Zurich, was also sued in New York state
court over losses on mortgage-backed securities. The plaintiff,
Sealink Funding Ltd., said in its complaint that the $158.1
million in bonds are either held by Sealink or were previously
sold at a loss.  Claims against Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and UBS include
fraud and negligent misrepresentation, according to the filings.  Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Citigroup;  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs; and UBS spokeswoman  Karina Byrne  declined to
comment on the filings.  The cases are Bayerische Landesbank v. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., 653111-2012; IKB International SA in Liquidation v.
Citigroup Inc., 653100-2012; IKB International SA in Liquidation
v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 653101-2012; and Sealink Funding
Ltd. v. UBS AG, 653102-2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
