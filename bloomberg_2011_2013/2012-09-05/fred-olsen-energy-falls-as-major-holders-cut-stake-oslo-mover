Fred. Olsen Energy ASA (FOE) , a Norwegian
offshore drilling company, fell the most in three months in Oslo
trading after major shareholders  Ganger Rolf ASA (GRO)  and  Bonheur ASA (BON) 
sold part of their stakes.  Shares declined as much as 5.1 percent, the most since June
1, and traded down 4.6 percent at 236.5 kroner as of 2:19 p.m.,
making it the  biggest mover  on the OBX index.  Ganger Rolf and Bonheur, each sold 500,000 shares of their
equal 27 percent stakes at a 235 kroner apiece, representing a 5
percent discount to yesterdayâ€™s closing price, the companies
said in a statement today.  The sale equaled half the two million share limit that the
two owners put on the private placement, according to a
statement yesterday. Fred. Olsen Energy has risen 24 percent so
far this year.  Fred Olsen Energy owns and operates a fleet of two
deepwater drilling rigs and six semi-submersible vessels, as
well as one accommodation unit. The Oslo-based company has two
units under construction, an ultra deepwater drillship due for
delivery in the third quarter of 2013, and an ultra deepwater
semi submersible vessel scheduled for delivery in the first
quarter of 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
