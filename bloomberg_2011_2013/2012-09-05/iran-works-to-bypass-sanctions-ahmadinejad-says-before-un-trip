Iran is working to by-pass sanctions
that amount to a “full-scale, hidden psychological war”
against the Islamic republic, President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 
said.  The restrictions have hurt the country’s economy, and there
are “problems in selling oil, there are some problems in
transferring money,” Ahmadinejad said in an interview on state
television before traveling to the  United Nations  in New York to
attend the General Assembly meeting.  “We have oil and the world needs it,” Ahmadinejad said.
He said his government is working on ways around the sanctions,
without giving details. Iran’s  oil output  dropped to 2.75
million barrels a day in August from 3.1 million the previous
month, according to Bloomberg data.  The measures imposed by the U.S., UN and European Union,
including an oil embargo and banking curbs, are aimed at halting
 Iran’s nuclear program . The U.S. and Israel have expressed
concern that Iran may be building nuclear weapons, and warned
that they will consider military action to prevent that. Iran
says its program is for peaceful purposes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
