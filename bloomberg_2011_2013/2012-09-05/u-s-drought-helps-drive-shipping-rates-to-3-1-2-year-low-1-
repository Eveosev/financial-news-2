The worst U.S. drought in more than
half a century helped drive down rates for Panamax vessels
shipping grains to the lowest in more than 3 1/2 years as it
results in a slump in cereal cargoes.  The ships hauling about 60,000 metric tons of grains and
other commodities including coal and  iron ore  slid 5.7 percent
to $5,141 a day, the lowest since January 2009, according to
data from the Baltic Exchange in  London  today. The Baltic Dry
Index, a wider measure of costs, fell 1.3 percent to 684 points.  Global grain exports will fall the most in 27 years in the
2012-13 marketing year as the drought curbs shipments from the
world’s largest supply country, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. Canceled grains cargoes mean owners of vessels are
undercutting each other or dropping anchor waiting for
employment, said Fearnleys A/S, an Oslo-based shipbroker.  “The horizon does not look very bright,”  Fearnleys said
in a report today. “Only a few forward cargoes of grains are
being quoted in the market.”  Panamaxes joining the fleet jumped 43 percent in the last
two quarters, adding new vessels at the fastest pace since 2001,
according to data from Macquarie Research and  Clarkson (CKN)  Plc.  Daily earnings to hire Panamaxes for voyages across the
Atlantic Ocean fell the most since Feb. 12, sliding 9.5 percent
to $4,153, the lowest since Dec. 18, 2008, exchange data show.  Grains Contraction  The global grain trade will contract 9.1 percent to 289.4
million metric tons in the 2012-13 marketing year, the USDA
estimates. That’s the biggest retreat since 1985-86, when it
shrank by 18 percent.  The drought affecting the U.S. grain crop will
“significantly affect” Panamax vessels and Supramax vessels 25
percent smaller through the autumn harvest, Clarkson said in a
report distributed last month.  Daily Supramax earnings declined 0.5 percent to $8,834,
while average costs for Handysize ships, the smallest tracked by
the  Baltic Exchange , slid 0.2 percent to $6,623. Capesizes, the
largest, mostly shipping iron ore, advanced 0.9 percent to
$3,497 a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
