WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , the second-biggest
U.S. health insurer, is planning a four-part debt offering to
help fund its $4.9 billion acquisition of  Amerigroup Corp. (AGP)   The operator of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance
plans may sell three-, five-, 10- and 30- year notes as soon as
today, according to a person familiar with the transaction. The
offering will be of benchmark size, typically at least $500
million.  Wellpoint plans to use proceeds, along with cash on hand
and commercial paper borrowings, to fund the roughly $5 billion
acquisition, the company said in a filing today. The company
agreed to acquire  Virginia Beach , Virginia-based Amerigroup in
July, expanding Indianapolis-based WellPoint’s Medicaid coverage
to more than 4.5 million members, the company said in a release
at the time.  If the acquisition isn’t closed by Sept. 9, 2013, the debt
will be repaid at 101 cents on the dollar, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the terms aren’t set.  The new bonds may be rated Baa2, the second-lowest level of
investment grade, by Moody’s Investors Service, the person said.
Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG are
managing the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
