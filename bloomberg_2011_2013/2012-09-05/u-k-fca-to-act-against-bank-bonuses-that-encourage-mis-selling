The U.K. Financial Conduct
Authority, the financial regulator that will start next year, is
planning enforcement proceedings against banks with bonus plans
and other incentive schemes that encourage improper sales to
consumers, the agency’s chief executive designate, Martin
Wheatley, said.  An initial review by U.K. authorities has found that
incentive programs for bank staff “were likely to drive people
to mis-sell in order to meet targets and receive a bonus, and
these risks were not being properly managed,” Wheatley will say
in a speech in  London  today, according to an e-mailed copy of
his remarks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
