Egypt  will offer 14 billion Egyptian
pounds ($2.3 billion) of government debt over the next week as
yields declined before International Monetary Fund loan talks
resume and as the U.S. reiterated an aid pledge.  The Arab country will seek to raise 10 billion pounds at
sales tomorrow and on Sept. 9 by selling treasury bills ranging
in maturity from three to 12 months, according to central bank
data on Bloomberg. It will seek bids for a combined 4 billion
pounds of three-, seven- and 10-year treasury bonds on Sept. 10.  The average yield on  seven-year bonds  dropped 25 basis
points at a sale this week to 16.65 percent, the lowest since
January. An IMF delegation is due to resume talks in the second
week of September with Egypt for a loan of as much as $4.8
billion, Finance Minister Momtaz El-Saieed said in August. These
funds are needed to bridge the  budget deficit , including
 government investment  to restart the economy, El-Saieed said
yesterday.  The Obama administration is going forward with a plan
announced last year to provide Egypt with a $1 billion aid
package, including debt relief, to help the country’s economy,
Patrick Ventrell, the State Department’s acting deputy
spokesman, said yesterday.  The yield on the nation’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in
2020 was little changed at 5.47 percent at 3:11 p.m. in Cairo,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s near the
lowest level in almost a year. The pound, subject to a managed
float, strengthened 0.1 percent to 6.0965 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
