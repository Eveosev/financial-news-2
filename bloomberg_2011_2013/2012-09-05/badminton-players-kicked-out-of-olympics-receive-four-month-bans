Two Indonesian badminton players
kicked out of the  London  Olympics for deliberate poor play were
suspended for four months by their national federation.  Greysia Polii and Meiliana Jauhari were banned from
national and international tournaments until Dec. 3, the
Badminton Association of  Indonesia  said in a  statement  on its
website. Team coach Paulus Firman was also suspended for four
months, with the three bans backdated to the  Olympic Games .  “Please understand that the sanction must be given to them
because Greysia/Meiliana have violated fair-play regulations,”
association Secretary General Yacob Rusdianto said in the
statement.  Polii and Jauhari were among eight players disqualified
from the women’s doubles tournament at the Olympics for poor
play.  The four teams may have been attempting to lose to avoid
more difficult opponents in the quarterfinals, when the
competition moved to a knockout stage. All four already had
qualified out of the group competition, which was new in this
year’s Olympics.  “After this, we will focus on training so that we can
compete later and we can perform well,” Jauhari said.  South Korea ’s Jung Kyung Eun, Kim Ha Na, Ha Jung Eun and
Kim Min Jung had their original two-year bans from the Badminton
Korea Association reduced to six months on appeal last month.  China’s Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang were ordered to apologize
for the incident by their federation and Yu said she would
retire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
