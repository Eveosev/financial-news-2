China’s non-manufacturing industries
expanded at a weaker pace in August as new orders slowed, a
private survey indicated.  The purchasing managers’ index fell to 52 from 53.1 in July,
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics said today. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  China’s government faces mounting pressure for additional
measures to support growth as the economy risks slowing for a
seventh straight quarter on weakness in exports and output. The
HSBC gauge contrasts with a services index released Sept. 3 by
the government, which showed a faster expansion in August.  “The main risk confronting  China’s economy  is still to the
downside,”  Qu Hongbin , chief China economist for HSBC in Hong
Kong, said in a statement. “Beijing is expected to do more to
counter-balance the external shock.”  The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  of stocks fell 0.6
percent as of 10:38 a.m. local time, approaching the level from
the aftermath of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.  Service industries  account for about 43 percent of the
economy compared with about 90 percent in the U.S. Under China’s
current five-year plan, the government is seeking to raise the
share of services in gross domestic product to 47 percent by
2015, the official Xinhua News Agency said in May.  --Scott Lanman. Editors: Scott Lanman, Paul Panckhurst  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
