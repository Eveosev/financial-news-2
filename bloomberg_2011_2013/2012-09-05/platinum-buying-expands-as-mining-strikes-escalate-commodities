Investors are buying platinum at the
fastest pace since 2010 after disruptions at South African mines
caused the biggest loss of supply in at least seven years.  Strikes and pit closures meant mining companies extracted
380,000 ounces less than they could have this year, equal to
about 6 percent of global output, Deutsche Bank AG estimates.
Metal purchases through exchange-traded products were the most
in 20 months in August, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices
will average $1,625 an ounce in the fourth quarter, the highest
in more than a year, according to the median of 12 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The lost production is diminishing a glut that drove prices
to within 0.4 percentage point of a  bear market  in July and
below the cost of extracting the metal. The rebound accelerated
after police killed 34 strikers at  Lonmin Plc (LMI) ’s Marikana complex
last month. It was the worst mine violence since the end of
apartheid in 1994 in  South Africa , which accounts for about 75
percent of global output.  Hedge funds  are now their most bullish
since March, U.S. government data show.  “Supplies are going to be challenged,” said Nic Johnson,
who helps manage $30 billion of commodity assets at Pacific
Investment Management Co. in  Newport Beach ,  California . Platinum
“moved very close to the marginal cost of production which
should put an upward pressure on prices. Any type of outages in
South Africa will make it more attractive.”  Global Production  Platinum is now 13 percent higher this year at $1,582.75,
having dropped to an almost seven-month low of $1,379.25 on July
24. Only silver has gained more this year among precious metals.
The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities advanced 4.2
percent and the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities climbed
9 percent. Treasuries returned 2.5 percent, a Bank of America
Corp.  index (MXWD)  shows.  Global production will exceed demand by 99,000 ounces this
year, 77 percent less than in 2011, as South African output
retreats almost 10 percent to a decade-low of 4.38 million
ounces, Barclays Plc estimates. Supply will contract 6 percent,
outpacing a 2.2 percent decline in demand, Barclays forecasts.  Lonmin, the third-biggest platinum producer, says it has
been losing 2,500 ounces of daily production since Marikana was
shut by a strike Aug. 10.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  shut its
Rustenburg mine, the world’s biggest, for six weeks in January
after employees went on strike over pay.  Zondereinde Mine  Wage disputes are adding to mining companies’ struggle to
maintain output. They are now digging as deep as 1.3 miles to
find ore, and temperatures at the rock face of  Northam Platinum
Ltd. (NHM) ’s Zondereinde mine in South Africa can reach as high as 162
degrees Fahrenheit (72 degrees Celsius). Lonmin got 4.4 grams of
platinum-group metals from every ton of ore last year, 5.4
percent less than in 2010.  Global extraction costs are now about $1,430 an ounce,
according to Thorsten Proettel, an analyst at Landesbank Baden
Wuerttemberg in Stuttgart,  Germany . The average annual price has
exceeded that only three times in the past quarter century.  While analysts expect prices to keep rising, they would
have to advance another 45 percent to match the record $2,301.50
reached in March 2008. Production fell 220,000 ounces short of
demand that year, Barclays estimates. Lonmin made $455 million
in 2008 and will report profit of $13.9 million in 2012, based
on the mean of nine analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Catalytic Converters  Demand may fall short of analysts’ expectations because 38
percent is tied to the metal’s use in catalytic converters for
vehicles. Platinum is used with palladium and rhodium in the
canisters with honeycomb-like surfaces that convert emissions
into less harmful substances.  The economy in  China , the biggest car market, has slowed
for six quarters, the 17-nation euro area is contracting, and
 consumer confidence  in the U.S. fell the most in 10 months in
August.  Europe  accounted for 27 percent of consumption last year
and China 25 percent, according to Johnson Matthey Plc, the
maker of one in three autocatalysts.  “There are potential claims on the supply side, but it’s
very much the demand that’s going to drive prices lower in the
coming months,” said Ross Strachan, a commodities economist at
Capital Economics Ltd. in  London . “The largest source of demand
for platinum is in Europe, and the one overriding point is the
poor state of the European economy.”  Rising prices will also spur more recycling. Supply from
spent autocatalysts jumped 21 percent in 2008 as platinum
surged, according to London-based Johnson Matthey. Total
scrapping rose to a record 2.05 million ounces in 2011 as prices
averaged an all-time high of $1,721.  Car Sales  Global sales of cars and light commercial vehicles will
rise 5.5 percent to a record 81.1 million units this year,
according to LMC Automotive Ltd., a research company in Oxford,
 England . Carmakers will use 3.22 million ounces this year, the
most since 2008, and 3.81 million in 2013, Morgan Stanley
estimates.  Hedge funds  and other speculators almost tripled wagers on
rising prices in the two weeks through Aug. 28, U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission data show. They now hold a net 20,072
U.S. futures and options, the most since March. ETP holdings
reached an 11-month high of 45.3 metric tons on Sept. 4, valued
at $2.31 billion and 2.3 percent below the record set in
September 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS) , the biggest producer, will
report profit of 3.03 billion rand ($365 million) next year,
from 1.38 billion rand in 2012, based on the mean of eight
analyst estimates. The Johannesburg-based company made 3.59
billion rand in 2011. Its shares dropped 21 percent to about 420
rand this year.  “The mines are unprofitable,” said  David Christensen , who
oversees $600 million of assets as chief executive officer of
ASA Ltd., a  San Mateo , California-based company investing in
precious-metal companies. “Increasing labor activity is going
to negatively affect production.”  To contact the reporters for this story:
