Banks around the world are
underestimating the regulatory requirements that will be imposed
on financial firms, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Chief
Executive Officer Gerald McCaughey said.  “I think that people are underestimating globally how far
the regulators are going to go over time in terms of the
requirements,” McCaughey said today at a  financial-services
conference  in Toronto hosted by  Bank of Nova Scotia. (BNS)  “Globally,
you will see a continued series of increases in requirements,
whether or not it’s from a viewpoint of  leverage ratio  or Tier 1
common equity.”  McCaughey said it would be “difficult to believe” that
Canada wouldn’t eventually be affected by capital levels in the
U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
