Critics of the regulations imposed
during President  Barack Obama ’s administration have overstated
their effects on the  U.S. economy , said Cass Sunstein, who left
his post this year as the administration’s top regulator.  “If you’ve got any kernel of a complaint, you turn it into
a mountain” in an election year, said Sunstein, now a professor
at Harvard Law School and a contributor to Bloomberg View.  Sunstein, 57, spoke at the Bloomberg Link at the Democratic
National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. He was
administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs until August.  He said the Obama administration has proposed fewer
regulations than those of his predecessor, Republican  George W. Bush .  Sunstein said he tried to bring an approach that relied on
cost-benefit analysis, so that the public could see what it was
getting from regulations.  “The cost-benefit analysis I think is first and foremost a
technical exercise, but it has a big democratic payoff,
democratic with a small d,” he said.  Sunstein also said he appreciated input from members of
Congress, who usually had constructive information about the
effect of regulations.  Tom Miller , a spokesman for the  Republican National
Committee , singled out Sunstein for criticism in responding to
his remarks.  “Barack Obama’s regulations have choked business growth
and nobody is more out of touch with how to spur small business
than legal professor Cass Sunstein,” Miller said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
