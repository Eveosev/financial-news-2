Gold futures declined for the first
time in three sessions as a European Central Bank plan to buy
bonds as part of an economic-stimulus program lowered demand for
the precious metal as a hedge against inflation.  The ECB was said to propose unlimited government-debt
purchases that will be sterilized, ensuring a neutral impact on
the  money supply  by removing funds from elsewhere in the banking
system. Yesterday, gold reached $1,701.60 an ounce, the highest
since March 13.  “The word ‘sterilized’ is bearish for gold,”  Frank McGhee , the head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “There is some profit-
taking too.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to
settle at $1,694 at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
commodity gained 2.3 percent in the previous two sessions.  In August, the metal jumped 4.5 percent, the most since
January, on speculation that the  Federal Reserve  and ECB will
increase steps to bolster their economies.  Silver futures for December delivery slid 0.3 percent to
$32.329 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery advanced 0.5 percent to $1,575.60 an ounce, the
third straight gain. Palladium futures for December delivery
rose 0.9 percent to $646.95 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
