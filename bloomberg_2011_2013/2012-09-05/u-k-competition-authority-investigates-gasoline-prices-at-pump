The U.K. Office of Fair Trading
began an investigation of the country’s gasoline market on
concern that it isn’t competitive enough.  The authority will explore whether falling crude  oil prices 
are reflected at gasoline pumps, whether independent retailers
can compete with supermarkets and larger chains and if there is
price coordination among rivals, it said today on its website.  “We are keenly aware of continuing widespread concern
about the pump price of petrol and diesel and we have heard a
number of different claims about how the market is operating,”
said Claire Hart, an OFT director. The investigation “will help
us determine whether claims about competition problems are well-
founded and whether further action is warranted.”  The Automobile Association lobby welcomed the announcement,
saying it’s hard for consumers to know when they’re paying a
fair price.  BP Plc (BP/)  will cooperate with the probe, a spokeswoman
said. A  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  spokeswoman declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
