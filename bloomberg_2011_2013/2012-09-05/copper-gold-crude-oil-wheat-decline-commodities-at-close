The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped 0.4 percent to 670 at 5:09 p.m.  Singapore 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials declined
0.4 percent to 1,598.448.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for a second day amid signs that the global
economy is struggling, while European Central Bank policy makers
prepare to discuss measures to stem the bloc’s debt crisis.  Oil for October delivery was at $95.04 a barrel, down 26
cents, in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
at 9:17 a.m.  London  time. The contract decreased $1.17 yesterday
to close at $95.30, the lowest level since Aug. 30. Front-month
prices are down 3.8 percent this year.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a benchmark price for
 Asia , rose $2.51 to $22.05 a barrel at 9:58 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker. The
increase of 13 percent is the most since March 15, 2011. Gasoil
swaps for October rose 25 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $132.65 a
barrel, PVM data showed.  High-sulfur fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 9
cents to $2.92 a barrel, PVM data showed. Fuel-oil swaps for
October fell $13.75, or 2 percent, to $683.75 a metric ton, PVM
data showed. The premium of 180-centistoke  fuel oil  to 380-
centistoke grade, or the viscosity spread, was unchanged at
$14.75 a ton.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas climbed for a fifth day in New York, the
longest run of gains since July 24, on speculation a government
report this week will show a smaller-than-normal increase in
stockpiles.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for a second day in London as weaker growth in
 Australia ’s economy added to concern about a global slowdown and
the outlook for metals demand.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold was set to decline for the first time in four days in
London as a stronger dollar cuts demand for the metal as an
alternative investment and before European Central Bank policy
makers meet.  Immediate-delivery bullion fell 0.2 percent to $1,691.73 an
ounce by 9:05 a.m. in London. December-delivery futures were 0.1
percent lower at $1,694 on the Comex in  New York .  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Wheat fell for a fourth day in  Chicago  as  Russia  continues
to offer cheaper supplies even after drought cut the harvest in
last year’s third-largest shipper.  The December-delivery contract dropped as much as 0.6
percent to $8.835 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before
trading at $8.8475 at 2:04 p.m. in Singapore. The price has
declined 6.6 percent from a near four-year high on July 23.  Corn for delivery in December slipped 0.2 percent to $8.035
a bushel. Soybeans for November delivery dropped 0.3 percent to
$17.635 a bushel, after the most-active contract surged to a
record $17.89 yesterday.  Rubber dropped for a second day, falling by the most in
three weeks, after a report showed U.S. manufacturing shrank,
boosting concern that a global slowdown will cut demand for the
commodity used in tires and gloves.  February-delivery rubber retreated as much as 3.5 percent,
the most since Aug. 14, to 216.5 yen a kilogram ($2,762 a metric
ton) on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Futures settled at 219.1
yen, extending this year’s loss to 17 percent.  Palm oil  fell for a second day on concern that inventories
in  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest producer, may advance to
an 11-month high because of a seasonal increase in output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
