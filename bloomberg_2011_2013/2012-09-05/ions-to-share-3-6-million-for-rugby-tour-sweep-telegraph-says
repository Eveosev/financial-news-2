The British and Irish Lions players
will share about 2.3 million pounds ($3.6 million) if they win
all 10 matches on their 2013 rugby union tour of Australia, the
 Daily Telegraph  reported.  Under the draft player contract, each squad member will
receive a basic tour fee of 45,000 pounds, which will rise to
67,000 pounds if the combined team from the U.K. and Ireland
sweep all their matches, the newspaper said.  With head coach Warren Gatland expected to select at least
35 players, combined basic tour fees will total at least 1.5
million pounds, rising to as much as 2.3 million pounds
depending on win bonuses, the newspaper added.  The basic fee is an 18 percent increase on the 38,000
pounds that was paid for the 2009 tour of  South Africa  and is
more than double the 22,000 pounds on offer in  New Zealand  four
years earlier, the Telegraph said.  The schedule begins June 1 against the Barbarians in  Hong
Kong . The first game in Australia is June 5 against Western
Force in Perth and the tour concludes with the third Test
against the Wallabies in Sydney on July 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
