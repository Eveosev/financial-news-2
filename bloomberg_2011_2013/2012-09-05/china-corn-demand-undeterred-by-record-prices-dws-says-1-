Corn consumption in  China , the
world’s second-largest user, remains resilient even after prices
rallied to a record in Chicago, according to DWS Investments,
which invests $3.4 billion in agriculture-related businesses.  “We still have strong demand from countries like China,”
Bill Barbour, an investment specialist for the DWS Global
Agribusiness fund, said in a Bloomberg Television interview
today. “There’s not been much demand destruction.”  Corn, used in feeds and ethanol production, rallied 24
percent this year, reaching a record last month, as the driest
summer since 1936 in the U.S. Midwest damaged crops. Barbour’s
assessment adds to signs that Asian nations may sustain demand
for food while costs increase and economic growth slows.  There is no correlation between economic growth and food
demand, said Barbour, citing U.S. Department of Agriculture data
that show no declines in global demand for grains and oilseeds
in recession-hit years in 2008 and 2009, and in the early 1990s.  Corn touched a record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10 and traded
at $7.9825 on the  Chicago  Board of Trade today. Soybeans, which
traded an all-time high of $17.89 a bushel yesterday, have
surged 46 percent this year, beating all other commodities on
the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials. The
rallies helped boost global food prices 6.2 percent in July.  Corn shipments  to China rose 36 percent in July from a
month earlier to a six-month high, according to customs data
compiled Bloomberg. Imports in the first 10 months of the 2011-
2012 marketing year totaled 4.2 million tons, compared with a
record 4.3 million tons in the whole of 1995-1996, data show.  Smaller Crop  U.S. corn production may total 10.779 billion bushels, 13
percent smaller than last year, the USDA said Aug. 10. Yields
may drop to 123.4 bushels an acre this year from 147.2 last year,
according to the USDA.  “The corn yield is likely to be below what the USDA is
currently forecasting,” Barbour said. “There’s a risk that
some of the supply-chain managers may not actually be able to
delivery grains to their customers.”  DWS Investments managed $312.2 billion globally as of June
30, according to the company’s web site. The firm is the mutual-
fund unit of Deutsche Asset Management.  -With assistance from Anand Menon in  Singapore  and Jack Kaskey
