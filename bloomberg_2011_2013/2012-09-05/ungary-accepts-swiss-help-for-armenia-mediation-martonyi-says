Hungary  has accepted an offer from
Switzerland to mediate in a dispute with Armenia caused by the
extradition from the eastern European country of a convicted
murderer to  Azerbaijan , Hungarian Foreign Minister Janos Martonyi said today.  It is “regrettable, unacceptable and to be condemned”
that Azerbaijan “broke its promise” and pardoned Ramil
Safarov, Martonyi told Hungary’s state-run MR1 radio in an
interview. Safarov, who killed an Armenian soldier in Hungary in
2004, was transferred home last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
