The euro may decline to a two-year
low after it reaches the upper range of its so-called downward
channel, Forecast Pte said, citing trading patterns.  The 17-nation currency is in the channel, which has a top
line demarcated by highs of $1.4549 on Aug. 29, 2011 and $1.4247
on Oct. 27, said Pak Lai Ng, a Singapore-based technical analyst
at Forecast. The bottom line of the channel runs through the low
of $1.3146 on Oct. 4. The single currency has never climbed
above the channel, and its upper limit was about $1.2674 today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The euro dropped 0.3 percent to $1.2535 as of 10:38 a.m. in
 Tokyo  from the close in  New York  yesterday.  Europe ’s single
currency has risen 4 percent since it touched $1.2043 on July
24, the lowest level since June 2010.  The euro is “only correcting up,” Ng said. “After the
correction, it should head back down again to retest” the July
24 low, he said.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
