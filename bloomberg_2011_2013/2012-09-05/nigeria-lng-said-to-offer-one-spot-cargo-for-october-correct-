(Corrects number in headline.)  Nigeria LNG Ltd., Africa’s biggest
exporter of liquefied natural gas, tendered to sell a cargo of
the fuel on the  spot market  in October, two people with
knowledge of the matter said.  One shipment is scheduled to load at Nigeria LNG’s Bonny
Island plant in the Niger River delta from Oct. 13 to Oct. 15
and the offer will close on Sept. 11, the people said, declining
to be identified because the information isn’t public. The
tender is for 140,000 cubic meters, the people cited tender
documents as saying.  The cargo is worth more than $43 million, based on  World
Gas Intelligence  prices published today for northeast  Asia  of
$13.10 a million British thermal units. Spot prices have fallen
29 percent from their May 28 high of $18.40, WGI data show.  Nigeria LNG also offered on Aug. 17 to sell a cargo of the
same size for loading Sept. 21 to Sept. 23, two of the people
said.  Siene Allwell-Brown, a spokeswoman for Nigeria LNG in
Lagos, didn’t respond to an e-mail sent yesterday seeking
comment and couldn’t be reached by phone.  Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. owns 49 percent of
Nigeria LNG, according to the company’s website.  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  has a 25.6 percent stake,  Total SA (FP)  owns a 15 percent
share and  Eni SpA (ENI)  10.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
