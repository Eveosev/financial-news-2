Lady Gaga is going for the biggest
arena she can find on her return to London. Not content with the
 O2’s  20,000 seats, she’s got the 55,000 at Twickenham Stadium.  We look forward to the steak-colored leotard, now that the
wondrous meat-dress predecessor has been retired.  In a busy weekend for London rock fans, Noel Gallagher and
Elbow play today;  Jack White  and  Leonard Cohen  on Saturday at
the Roundhouse and Wembley Arena.  Information:  http://www.rfu.com/TwickenhamStadium ,

poetry and music. The free event, between Westminster and Tower
bridges, will be the biggest in its 16-year history.  Highlights include a celebration of Korean culture, along
with a 1,000-strong steel-pan concert in homage to Brazil, host
country for the next Olympics.  Information:  http://thamesfestival.org/   Saturday  The Last Night of the Proms at the  Royal Albert Hall  has
works by Puccini and Verdi leading into the usual “Land of Hope
and Glory,” “ Jerusalem ,” “God Save the Queen” and patriotic
flag-waving all around.  Royal Albert Hall,  Kensington Gore , SW7 2AP. Information:
+44-845-401-5045;  http://www.royalalberthall.com  or
 http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms .  Earlier,  Kylie Minogue  will gyrate in Hyde Park as part of
the Proms events. She’ll face competition on the open-air stage
from  Il Divo , tenor  Alfie Boe , and the London Community Gospel
Choir. The show, presented by Terry Wogan, starts at 5:15 p.m.
and tickets are 35 pounds ($56).  The Queens Arms is just around the corner from the Royal
Albert Hall, hidden in one of Kensington’s best mews. The pub’s
menu lists cask real ales and wild salmon fishcakes.  30 Queens Gate Mews, SW7 5QL. Information: +44-20-7823-9293
or  http://www.thequeensarmskensington.co.uk   Saturday Night  The  Royal Shakespeare Company’s  “Julius Caesar” puts a
new perspective on the play. Rome is moved to an anonymous,
possibly African state, with an all-black cast.  Jeffery Kissoon 
is imperious as Caesar and Ray Fearon delivers a passionate
“friends, Romans, countrymen” speech.  Noel Coward Theatre, 85-88 St. Martin’s Lane, WC2N 4AU,
through Sept. 15. Information: +44-20-7759-8010 or
 http://www.delfontmackintosh.co.uk .  Les Deux Salons, near the theater, is a French-style
brasserie. Michelin-starred chef Anthony Demetre refines the
winning formula developed at Arbutus and  Wild Honey . He serves
afternoon tea, as well as pre-and post-theater menus.  40-42 William IV Street, London, WC2N 4DD. Information:
+44-20-7420-2050 or  http://www.lesdeuxsalons.co.uk/   Sunday  Sterling Clark, heir to the Singer sewing-machine fortune,
spent decades in Paris collecting art. The loot he took home
includes a Monet from his series of cliffs at Etretat with each-
colored light flecking the water. Clark bought it for the
ridiculously low sum of $5,500 in 1933 -- a fraction of what a
Renoir cost him (the receipts are on show).  “From Paris: A Taste for Impressionism” ends Sept. 23 at
the  Royal Academy  of Arts on Piccadilly. Information:
 http://www.royalacademy.org.uk  or +44-844-209-0051.  Sunday Night  The closing ceremony of the  Paralympic Games  at the Olympic
Stadium features more than 1,000 dancers and actors. The event
is titled “Festival of Flame” and headlined by Coldplay.  You can watch it at the BBC Big Screens in Woolwich and
Waltham Forest, or the BT London Live screen in  Trafalgar
Square .  Information:  http://bbc.co.uk/bigscreens  or
