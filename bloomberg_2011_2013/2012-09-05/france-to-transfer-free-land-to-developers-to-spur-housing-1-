French President  Francois Hollande 
plans to transfer state-owned land to developers to build
hundreds of thousands of new homes each year, the  Ministry of
Housing  said.  Hollande’s Socialist government listed 930 plots
representing 2,000 hectares (4,942 acres) that can be
transferred, including 59 hectares in Paris, the government said
today after its weekly Cabinet meeting. The state will provide
the land for free or almost free to developers and will require
the construction of mainly rent-controlled homes.  The measure should allow the building of 110,000 lodgings
over the next three years, half of which will be in the Paris
region, Urban Affairs Minister Cecile Duflot said after the
Cabinet met.  Overall, the government’s goal is to encourage the
construction of 500,000 lodgings a year, of which 150,000 would
be rent-controlled, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud- Belkacem told reporters. The government will also multiply by
five the fines levied on local governments that don’t build
enough low-cost housing.  The measures won’t hurt the government’s budget deficit
because of the jobs created as well as tax receipts on work and
construction, Vallaud-Belkacem said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
