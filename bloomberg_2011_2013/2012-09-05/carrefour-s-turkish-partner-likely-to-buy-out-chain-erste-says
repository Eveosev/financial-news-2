Carrefour SA’s (CA)  local partner in
 Turkey  will probably buy the French retailer out of its business
there, according to analysts at Erste Group Bank AG.  The analysts give an 85 percent probability to  Haci Omer
Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL)  buying Carrefour’s 58 percent stake in the
local Carrefoursa chain to add to its existing 39 percent
holding, they said today in an e-mailed research note. The
remaining shares are publicly traded on the Istanbul bourse.  “This is the most likely outcome,” Erste Group’s Gorkem Goker and Mehmet Zumrut said in the note. “Sabanci will
consider the alternative of better operating the existing stores
in the absence of a French contribution to management.”  Carrefour Chief Executive Officer Georges Plassat said Aug.
30 that the Boulogne-Billancourt, France-based company will
review businesses in Turkey and Poland as local competitors are
better placed. Sabanci, Turkey’s second-biggest group of
companies, has hired Rothschild to study strategic options for
 Carrefoursa Carrefour Sabanci Ticaret Merkezi AS (CARFA)  and expects to
complete the process this year.  Four Sabanci executives resigned from the board of the
Istanbul-based retail chain on July 16, saying the French
company isn’t supporting Sabanci’s goals.  Carrefoursa has about 250 stores in Turkey compared with
the 4,000 operated by the country’s biggest retailer BIM
