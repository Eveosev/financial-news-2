The pound rose to the highest in
more than three months versus the dollar on signs the U.K.
recession is easing and as speculation the  European Central Bank 
will announce a plan to buy bonds boosted European currencies.  Gilts fell after data late yesterday showed services growth
accelerated in August more than economists forecast, adding to
the case for the  Bank of England  to refrain from expanding
stimulus tomorrow. Analysts predict policy makers will keep
monetary policy unchanged. The ECB also meets tomorrow, three
days after President  Mario Draghi  made his strongest case yet
for the purchase of indebted nations’ bonds to quell the euro-
area debt crisis.  “The U.K. data is a marginal positive for sterling,” said
 Paul Robson , a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc in  London . “European currencies including
sterling are also doing better as the market seems to be taking
the idea the ECB will be more active in stabilizing weak
sovereign markets as a positive.”  The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.5910 at 4:11 p.m. London
time, after reaching $1.5934, the strongest level since May 16.
The U.K. currency was little changed at 79.23 pence per euro
after appreciating to 78.88 pence, the strongest since Aug. 23.  A services gauge based on a survey of  purchasing managers 
surged to 53.7, the highest in five months, from 51 in July,
Markit Economics and the  Chartered Institute of Purchasing and
Supply  said in London yesterday. Economists had forecast an
increase to 51.2, according to the median of 28 estimates in a
Bloomberg News poll. A reading above 50 indicates growth.  Draghi Plan  Draghi’s bond-buying proposal involves unlimited purchases
of government debt that will be matched by the ECB’s removal of
an equivalent amount of money from elsewhere in the system to
assuage concerns about printing money, two central bank
officials briefed on the plan said.  Draghi told lawmakers in a closed-door session at the
European Parliament in Brussels on Sept. 3 that the ECB has lost
control of borrowing costs in the monetary union.  Bloomberg News 
obtained a recording of his comments, some of which were
published by Italian news agency AGI.  The pound has gained 1.4 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 0.5 percent and
the euro rose 1.5 percent.  Gilts Sale  Yields on 10-year gilts rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.64 percent after reaching 1.71 percent
yesterday, the highest since Aug. 21. The 1.75 percent bond
maturing in September 2022 fell 0.115 or 1.15 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 101.02.  Thirty-year rates rose four basis points to 2.97 percent
after the Debt Management Office sold 1.75 billion pounds of the
bonds at an average yield of 2.951 percent. Investors bid for
1.5 times the amount of gilts on offer. That compares with a so-
called bid-to-cover ratio of 2.2 times at the previous sale on
May 9, when yields averaged 3.224 percent.  Gilts also fell as data from the  British Retail Consortium 
showed shop prices rose 1.1 percent in August from a year
earlier, compared with a 1 percent gain in July.  Policy makers will leave the Bank of England’s asset-
purchase target at 375 billion pounds, according to the median
estimate of economists forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  Gilts have returned 4.2 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German
bunds gained 3.7 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
