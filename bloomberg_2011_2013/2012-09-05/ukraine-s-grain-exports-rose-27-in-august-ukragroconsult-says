Ukraine’s grain exports rose 27
percent in August compared with a year earlier on increased
wheat shipments, agriculture researcher UkrAgroConsult said.  Exports advanced to 1.88 million metric tons last month,
the researcher, which is based in the capital Kiev, said in an
e-mailed statement today. That compares with 1.48 million tons a
year earlier.  Wheat accounted for 824,000 tons, barley for 784,000 tons
and corn for 243,000 tons, the researcher said. Another 246,600
tons of wheat, 101,000 tons of barley and 94,200 tons of corn
are expected to be shipped from ports in the near future.  To contact the reporter on this story:
