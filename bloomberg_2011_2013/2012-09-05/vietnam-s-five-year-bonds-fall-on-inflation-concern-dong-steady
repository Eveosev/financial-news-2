Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell,
pushing the yield to the highest level in almost six weeks, on
speculation inflation will accelerate, reducing room for policy
makers to cut  interest rates . The dong was steady.  State Bank  of Vietnam Governor Nguyen Van Binh said on Aug.
21 the central bank will be “very cautious” in lowering
borrowing costs further, following a 5 percentage point
reduction in its refinance rate this year. Consumer-price gains
may quicken to between 6 percent and 7 percent by year-end,
analysts at  Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  wrote in
an Aug. 24 note, from 5.04 percent in August.  “Investors are concerned that inflation may rise toward
the year-end and want to wait for better bond prices,” said
Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based debt trader at Bank for Investment
& Development of Vietnam.  The yield on benchmark five-year bonds rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.84 percent, according to a
daily fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
highest level since July 27.  The dong traded at 20,855 per dollar as of 3:52 p.m. in
Hanoi, compared with 20,861 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The State Bank of Vietnam set its
 reference rate  at 20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to
its website. The currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on
either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
