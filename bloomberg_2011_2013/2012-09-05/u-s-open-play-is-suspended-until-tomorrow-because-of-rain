Rain has postponed play for the day
at the U.S. Open tennis championship, where only two singles
matches were completed today.   Andy Roddick’s night-session match against Juan Martin Del Potro was halted just after 9 p.m. New York time as a light rain
started to fall during a first-set tiebreaker at the National
Tennis Center.   The Roddick-Del Potro match will be completed tomorrow, as
will suspended matches involving defending men’s champion Novak Djokovic and 2006 women’s champion  Maria Sharapova .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
