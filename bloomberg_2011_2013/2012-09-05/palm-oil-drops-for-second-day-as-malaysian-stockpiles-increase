Palm oil fell for a second day on
concern that inventories in  Malaysia , the world’s second-largest
producer, may advance to an 11-month high because of a seasonal
increase in output.  The November-delivery contract fell as much as 0.8 percent
to 3,035 ringgit ($975) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and ended the morning session at 3,041 ringgit  Kuala
Lumpur . Futures have lost 4.2 percent this year.  Stockpiles probably rose 7 percent to 2.14 million tons in
August from 2 million tons in July, according to the median in
the Bloomberg survey of two analysts and three plantation
companies. That would be the highest level since September last
year. Output climbed 0.5 percent to 1.7 million tons on-month,
while exports rose 9.5 percent to 1.42 million tons, the survey
showed. The  Palm Oil  Board releases the data on Sept. 10.  “The market is lower because of supply pressure from
Malaysia and Indonesia as production is generally higher in
September,” Vijay Mehta, a director at Commodity Links Pte.,
said by phone from Singapore. “Prices should remain around the
current levels for demand to continue to come up and the supply
pressure to ease.”  November-delivery soybeans dropped as much as 0.3 percent
to $17.6225 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after rising
to an all-time high of $17.89 yesterday.  Soybean oil  for
December delivery slid as much as 0.6 percent to 57.90 cents a
pound. Palm oil and soybean oil are used in foods and fuels.  Palm oil for January delivery fell 0.2 percent to 8,230
 yuan  ($1,296) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month declined 0.6 percent to
10,200 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
