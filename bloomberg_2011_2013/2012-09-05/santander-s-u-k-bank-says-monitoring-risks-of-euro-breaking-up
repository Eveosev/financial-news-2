Banco Santander SA (SAN) ’s U.K.  unit  is
“actively monitoring” risks associated with a member country
leaving the euro or the currency breaking up, according to a
report filed with regulators.  “Redenomination risk arises from the uncertainties arising
from the exit of a member state from the euro or a total
dissolution,” the unit of  Spain’s biggest bank  said in a  filing 
to U.K. and U.S. regulators. “The group has been actively
identifying and monitoring potential redenomination risks and,
where possible, taking steps with the potential to mitigate
them.”  Santander U.K. has 12.5 billion pounds ($19.9 billion) in
assets and 47.4 billion pounds of liabilities arising in
contracts denominated in euros and 35 billion pounds in
associated hedges, the lender said. The U.K. unit led by Ana Patricia Botin, the daughter of group Chairman  Emilio Botin ,
contributed 13 percent to Santander’s first-half profit.  “This disclosure was required of all major U.K. banks by
our regulator,” said Andy Smith, a spokesman for Santander U.K.
in a statement sent by e-mail. “Our exposure to peripheral  euro
zone  remains less than 0.5 percent of the balance sheet.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
