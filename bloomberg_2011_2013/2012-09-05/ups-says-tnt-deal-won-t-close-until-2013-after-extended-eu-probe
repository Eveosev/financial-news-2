United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  said it
doesn’t expect to close the 5.16 billion-euro ($6.5 billion)
purchase of  TNT Express NV (TNTE)  until the first quarter after the
European Union extended its review of the deal.  UPS, which had anticipated completion this year, also
pushed back the deadline for TNT shareholders to respond from
Aug. 31 to Nov. 9 because antitrust clearance won’t be received
by the original deadline, the Atlanta-based company said today.  EU regulators resumed a probe of the bid for Hoofddorp,
Netherlands-based TNT on Aug. 23 after suspending it earlier in
the month to seek more information, setting a new deadline of
Dec. 20 to rule on the deal. UPS, the world’s biggest package-
delivery company, is seeking to expand in  Europe  with a bid that
would vault it to equal footing with  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) ’s DHL.  “UPS and TNT Express remain committed to the offer and are
working closely to fulfill all offer conditions,” the companies
said in today’s joint statement.  TNT fell 0.1 percent to 8.88 euros in Amsterdam prior to
the announcement, which came after the close, for a value of
4.82 billion euros. The price is about 6.5 percent below UPS’s
cash offer of 9.50 euros a share, which TNT accepted in March.  The euro has declined since the bid agreement, reducing the
dollar value of the offer from an initial $6.8 billion.  The tie-up with unprofitable TNT would immediately add to
earnings on an adjusted basis, UPS said in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
