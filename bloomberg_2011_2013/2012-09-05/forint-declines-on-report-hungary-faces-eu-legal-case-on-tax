The forint weakened after Brussels-
based news website Bruxinfo said the European Commission may
start a legal case against  Hungary  because of the country’s
financial transaction tax.  Hungary’s currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 285.27 per
euro by 4:19 p.m. in Budapest. Yields on the government’s
benchmark 10-year bonds were little changed at 7.405 percent.  The tax, which also applies to transactions at the central
bank, is complicating Hungary’s negotiations on an International
Monetary Fund credit line. Hungary may have to look for new
sources to replace revenue from the central bank if the IMF
objects to the levy, Antal Rogan, head of the ruling party’s
lawmakers, told Magyar Nemzet in an interview published today.  The forint’s slide was “definitely” caused by the report
about the infringement procedure, Peter Karsai, a Commerzbank AG
trader in Budapest, wrote in comments sent by e-mail.  The European Union’s executive arm may start the so-called
infringement procedure on Sept. 27, Bruxinfo said on its website
today, citing unnamed EU officials.  Hungary will probably reach an aid agreement “in the
autumn,” Premier  Viktor Orban  told foreign correspondents in
his office in Budapest today. The government is working on its
responses to IMF and EU policy proposals following a week of
negotiations in July, Orban said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
