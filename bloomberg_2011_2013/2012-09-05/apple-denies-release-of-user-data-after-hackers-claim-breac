Apple Inc. (AAPL)  said it didn’t provide
information on user accounts to the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation, after hackers claimed to have stolen data on 12
million users from an agency laptop.  The FBI denied having the data, some of which the hacker
group Anonymous said it released. The hackers say they accessed
the Apple data in March by breaking into a laptop of an FBI
agent.  “The FBI has not requested this information from Apple,
nor have we provided it to the FBI or any organization,” said
 Natalie Kerris , a spokeswoman for Apple.  To contact the reporter on this story:
