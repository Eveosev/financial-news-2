JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  investors
overreacted to a $5.8 billion trading loss during the first half
of this year and Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon  is doing a
“great” job, former CEO William B. Harrison said.  “It was disappointing to all of us that we had that kind
of loss, but the important thing is to put it into perspective,
which the market didn’t do very well,” Harrison, 69, said today
in an interview on CNBC. “A lot of people overreacted to it.”  JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is under
investigation by at least 11 agencies, including the U.S.
Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission, for
the loss at the London chief investment office. The firm’s
market value has dropped by about $28 billion since  Bloomberg
News  first reported on April 5 that the lender had amassed an
illiquid position on  credit derivatives .  Harrison, who retired from JPMorgan in 2006 after four
decades at the New York-based bank, said companies and employees
need to be able to make occasional mistakes and that he
“couldn’t be more proud” of that job that Dimon, 56, is doing.  “JPMorgan came through the financial crisis as we all know
without making a significant mistake,” Harrison said. “It’s
extraordinary that Jamie and team were able to manage it that
way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
