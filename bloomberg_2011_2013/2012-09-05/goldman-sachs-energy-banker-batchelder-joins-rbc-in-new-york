Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ’s Eric Batchelder, a managing director who advised energy and power
companies, left to join  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) ’s investment-
banking unit.  Batchelder joined RBC Capital Markets LLC as a managing
director last week, spokeswoman Elisa Barsotti said. He will
focus on  investment banking  for “master limited partnerships,”
companies that mainly manage oil and gas pipelines.  Batchelder had worked at New York-based Goldman Sachs since
at least 2002, according to the Finra  website . He was promoted
to managing director, the company’s second-highest rank behind
partner, in 2011. The records show he remains based in New York.  Batchelder helped advise Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy
LLC last year on the $1.9 billion sale of a collection of plants
and pipelines in Texas and Louisiana to partnerships controlled
by  Energy Transfer Equity LP. (ETE)   Batchelder also  advised  on fundraising efforts for Longview
Power LLC, which built a $2 billion coal-fired power plant in
West Virginia.  Sparkspread.com reported earlier this year that Batchelder
was leaving Goldman Sachs.  Doug McGregor, co-head of RBC Capital Markets, said in an
interview in December that the unit was slowing its expansion
after more than doubling headcount during the previous five
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
