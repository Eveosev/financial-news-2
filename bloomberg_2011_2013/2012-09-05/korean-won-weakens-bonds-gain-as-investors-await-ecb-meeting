South Korea’s won fell for a second
day and  government bonds  gained as a slump in U.S. manufacturing
deterred risk-taking ahead of a European Central Bank meeting to
discuss a debt-purchase plan tomorrow.  The euro weakened even after ECB President  Mario Draghi 
told lawmakers this week that the bank’s primary mandate compels
it to intervene in bond markets to ensure the common currency’s
survival. U.S. manufacturing shrank last month by the most since
July 2009, a report showed yesterday. South Korea plans to
announce economic stimulus measures next week without increasing
the budget, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said yesterday. The
 Kospi Index (KOSPI)  closed at the lowest level since Aug. 3.  “The euro declining before the ECB meeting and local share
losses after U.S. manufacturing data are all contributing to
risk-aversion sentiment in the market, weakening the won,” said
Cho Young Bok, a Seoul-based currency trader for Daegu Bank.  The won slipped 0.2 percent to 1,135.85 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-
month implied volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate
swings used to price options, jumped 25 basis points, or 0.25
percentage point, to 7.55 percent.  Bond Holdings  Overseas investors cut ownership of  South Korea ’s local-
currency bonds by 2.6 trillion won ($2.3 billion) in August to
86.9 trillion won, the biggest monthly decline this year, the
Financial Supervisory Service said in an e-mailed statement
today.  South Korea’s foreign-exchange  reserves  rose $2.53 billion
to a record $316.88 billion last month, the biggest increase in
six months, according to central bank figures released today.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due March
2017 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 2.83
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. Three-year debt
futures climbed 0.14 to 106.40 and the one-year interest-rate
swap slid two basis points to 2.81 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
