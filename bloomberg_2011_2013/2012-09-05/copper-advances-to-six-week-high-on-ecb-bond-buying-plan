Copper rose to a six-week high on
speculation that a European Central Bank plan to buy bonds will
help stem the region’s debt crisis, improving prospects for
metal demand.  A proposal from ECB President  Mario Draghi  involves
unlimited purchases of government debt that will be sterilized,
which ensures a neutral impact on the  money supply  by removing
funds from elsewhere in the banking system, two central bank
officials briefed on the plan said. Draghi will announce
tomorrow whether the plan has been adopted.  “Markets like what they are hearing, with copper in the
lead,”  Edward Meir , an analyst at INTL FCStone Inc. in  New
York , said in a report.  Copper futures for December delivery gained 1.7 percent to
settle at $3.529 a pound at 1:24 p.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, the price reached $3.534, the highest for a most-active
contract since July 19.  The dollar’s decline against a basket of major currencies
boosted the appeal of copper as an alternative investment.  Inventories of the metal monitored by the London Metal
Exchange declined 1.7 percent to 215,050 metric tons, the lowest
since October 2008.  Earlier, copper slid as much as 0.6 percent on signs that
global metal demand will ebb after expansion in  Australia ’s
gross domestic product slowed.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months gained 1.3
percent to $7,735.50 a ton ($3.51 a pound). Aluminum, nickel,
tin, lead and zinc also rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
