Corn yields in  Ukraine , where a
summer drought hurt crops, declined 27 percent, agriculture
researcher ProAgro said.  Average yields slid to 3.29 tons a hectare (2.47 acres)
from 4.49 tons a year earlier, the Kiev-based researcher said in
an e-mailed statement today. The grain was gathered from 92,000
hectares, against the 4.57 million hectares to be harvested this
year, ProAgro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
