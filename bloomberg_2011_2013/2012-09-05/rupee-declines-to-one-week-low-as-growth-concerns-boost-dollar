India ’s rupee fell to the lowest
level in almost three weeks as investors sought the perceived
safety of the dollar on concern global growth is slowing.  A report yesterday showed U.S. factory output shrank in
August by the most since July 2009 and London-based Markit
Economics said today euro-area services and manufacturing
contracted more than initially estimated. The Dollar Index,
which tracks the greenback against six major trading partners,
rose 0.1 percent. The European Central Bank’s Governing Council
will decide tomorrow on a bond-buying proposal that President
 Mario Draghi  says is necessary to ensure the euro’s survival.  “Today’s move is largely due to broad-based dollar
strength,” said Ashtosh Raina, head of foreign-exchange trading
at HDFC Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “We are also awaiting the outcome
of the ECB meeting.”  The rupee declined 0.5 percent to 55.9125 per dollar in
Mumbai, the biggest drop since Aug. 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 55.9600 earlier, the weakest
level since Aug. 16. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was unchanged at
9.50 percent.  The U.S. Institute for Supply Management’s factory index
fell to 49.6 last month from 49.8 in July, the Tempe, Arizona-
based group said. Economists in a Bloomberg survey projected a
reading of 50, which is the dividing line between expansion and
contraction.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.85 per
dollar, compared with 56.64 yesterday, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.86 from 56.55. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
