Crude options for later months rose
on speculation that futures prices will have wider swings after
the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.  Implied volatility for options expiring in November, a
measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge of
options prices, was 30.72 percent as of 4:55 p.m. in  New York ,
from 30.46 percent yesterday. Bearish bets accounted for 53
percent of the 36,783 contracts traded.  Volatility on December options volatility rose to 32.04
percent from 31.72 percent.  “People are looking beyond” the November presidential
“election and even to next year for any kind of price movement
and expecting prices may be range-bound the rest of the year,”
said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options Inc. in
New York.  Crude oil for October delivery rose 6 cents to settle at
$95.36 a barrel on the Nymex.  Rigolini said he saw brisk buying in November $90 puts and
December $100 and $110 calls trading as a spread. “We’re still
seeing people reaching out for some upside calls for
insurance.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
December 120 calls, up 7 cents to 54 cents a barrel at 5 p.m.
with 2,011 lots trading. October $85 puts were the second-most
active options, with 1,936 lots changing hands as they fell 2
cents to 12 cents a barrel. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of
crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  In the previous session, bearish bets accounted for 61
percent of the 115,733 contracts traded.  October $85 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 5,142 lots changing hands. They rose 4 cents to
14 cents a barrel. October $90 puts advanced 14 cents to 53
cents on volume of 3,878.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
46,433 contracts. Next were December $80 puts with 44,151 lots
and December $120 calls with 43,860.  To contact the reporter on this story:
