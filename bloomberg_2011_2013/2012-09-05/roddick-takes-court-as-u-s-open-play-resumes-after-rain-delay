Play has resumed at the U.S. Open
tennis championship in New York following rain delays that have
allowed only one match to be completed today.  Andy Roddick , the last American left in the men’s draw, is
beginning his fourth-round match in Arthur Ashe Stadium against
No. 7 seed Juan Martin Del Potro of Argentina.  In Louis Armstrong Stadium, fourth-seeded David Ferrer of
Spain and No. 13 Richard Gasquet of France will resume their
delayed match, with Ferrer holding a 7-5, 7-6 (7-2), 4-3 lead.
When that match is completed, defending men’s champion Novak Djokovic, the No. 2 seed from Serbia, is scheduled to play 18th-
seeded Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland.  Women’s top seed  Victoria Azarenka  of Belarus is the only
player to win a match today, with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5) victory
over defending champion Samantha Stosur, the No. 7 seed from
Australia.  Maria Sharapova  and  Marion Bartoli  had their day-session
quarterfinal match in Arthur Ashe Stadium suspended until
tomorrow so organizers could hold the Roddick-Del Potro night-
session match. Bartoli, the No. 11 seed from France, had a 4-0
lead over Sharapova, the women’s No. 3 seed and 2006 champion,
when play was halted by rain.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
