Discovery Holdings Ltd. (DSY) , the owner
of  South Africa ’s largest medical-insurance administrator, fell
the most in more than two-and-a-half years after saying life
policies may be held for less time than previously expected.  “The current economic environment may mean policy-holders
will hold their life policies for shorter periods than initially
envisaged,” Chief Executive Officer Adrian Gore said in a
results presentation in Johannesburg today.  Discovery Holdings shares dropped 3 percent, the biggest
decline since December 2009, to 56.20 rand at the 5 p.m. close
of trading in Johannesburg, where the company is based.  Net income for the year through June fell 15 percent to 2.2
billion rand ($263 million), the company said in a statement
today. That compared with the 2.4 billion-rand average estimate
of four analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The market might be worried about the Discovery life
business and potential policy lapses going forward,” Harry Botha, an analyst at Avior Research in Johannesburg, said by
telephone. “Discovery changed its assumptions and said policy
holders might hold on to their policies for shorter periods than
initially envisaged.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
