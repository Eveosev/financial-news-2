Iran ’s inflation rate rose to 23.5
percent in the month that ended on Aug. 20 from 22.9 percent the
previous month, the central bank said today on its website.  While the central bank said in its report that inflation
will continue to increase, President  Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  said in
a televised interview late yesterday that “the inflation growth
rate has declined this year. The inflation rate will decrease in
the second half of this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
