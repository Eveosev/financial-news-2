New York  gasoline weakened as Delta
Air Lines Inc. prepared to start the Trainer refinery in
 Pennsylvania .  Delta’s Monroe Energy LLC unit, which in April bought the
185,000-barrel-a-day plant from ConocoPhillips, expects
production by the end of this month, Trebor Banstetter, a
spokesman for the airline, said in a telephone interview. The
refinery, closed since September 2011, recently took delivery of
its first crude shipment, he said.  “I think the market feels they will begin processing crude
at the end of September and has a wait-and-see attitude about
when they get the downstream units on line and make finished
products such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel,”  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston, said in an
electronic message.  Conventional gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or CBOB,
in New York Harbor, dropped 1.25 cents to 13.75 cents a gallon
over futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 8:58
a.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
rose 0.06 cent to $3.1028 a gallon.  The premium for jet fuel at the hub versus Nymex heating
oil futures fell 1.25 cents to 12 cents a gallon.  Paul Jacobson, Delta’s chief financial officer, said in a
July 25 earnings call that the company was on target to begin
restarting the plant in mid-September.  Capacity Increase  Delta has said it is spending $100 million to increase
capacity at the plant from 185,000 barrels a day to 200,000, and
to increase the yield of jet fuel from 14 percent to 32 percent.  Phillip 66 (PSX) ’s 247,000-barrel-a-day Alliance  refinery  in
 Louisiana  lost power early today, the second time in about a
week the plant had an electrical failure.  “The utility provider expects to have power back to the
refinery by late today,” Phillips said in a  statement  on its
website.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
 Gulf Coast  rose 1 cent to 9.25 cents a gallon versus futures,
the widest since Aug. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
