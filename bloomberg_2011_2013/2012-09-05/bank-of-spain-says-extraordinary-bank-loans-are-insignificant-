The Bank of  Spain  said extraordinary
lending to banks is “insignificant” as a proportion of its
balance sheet, responding to a Wall Street Journal report that
it offered emergency loans that bypass usual European Central
Bank operations.  “Liquidity provision to banks other than ordinary monetary
policy operations represents an insignificant fraction of total
lending,” the Madrid-based central bank said in an e-mailed
statement today.  The Bank of Spain may have made about 400 million euros
($500 million) of loans through the so-called emergency
liquidity assistance program, the Journal reported today, citing
analysts. The Bank of Spain doesn’t publish figures or comment
on the ELA. Data on its website show “other claims on euro-zone
 credit institutions ” amounted to 402 million euros in July.  To contact the reporter on this story:
