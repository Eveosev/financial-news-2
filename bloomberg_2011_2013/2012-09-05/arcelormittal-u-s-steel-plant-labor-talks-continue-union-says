Talks between  ArcelorMittal (MT) , the
world’s largest steelmaker, and the United Steelworkers are
continuing four days after the previous labor contract expired,
the union said.  Tony Montana, a United Steelworkers spokesman, commented
today by e-mail. Bill Steers, a spokesman for Luxembourg-based
ArcelorMittal, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mailed request
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
