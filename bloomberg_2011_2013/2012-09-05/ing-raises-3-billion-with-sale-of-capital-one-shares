ING Groep NV (INGA)  raised about $3 billion
selling 54 million  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF)  shares received
when the Dutch lender sold its U.S. online bank this year.  The shares were priced at $55.75 each, two people familiar
with the matter said, asking not to be named because the terms
weren’t announced. The transaction, which represented a stake of
more than 9 percent in Capital One, may settle Sept. 10 and
result in a gain of about 300 million euros ($378 million) for
ING in the third quarter, the company said today in a statement.  ING, the largest Dutch financial-services firm, received
the shares as part of its February sale of ING Direct USA.
Capital One paid  $9.1 billion  of cash and stock, and by
yesterday the U.S lender’s shares climbed 15 percent since Feb.
16, the day before the deal was completed. The European Union
ordered ING to sell the U.S. online unit as a condition of its
government bailout during the financial crisis.  “The transaction confirms our view that ING can transfer 2
billion euros of excess capital from the bank to the holding by
year-end to repay part of the state support,” said Benoit Petrarque, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets.  Capital One fell less than 1 percent to $56.09 at 12:53
p.m. in  New York . ING  shares  rose 1.5 percent to 6.10 euros in
Amsterdam. ING is up about 5.9 percent since Aug. 29, when the
company announced the sale of its Canadian online bank for 2.5
billion euros to help repay a 2008 bailout.  Eli Leenaars  ING executive Eli Leenaars will step down from Capital
One’s board after the offer is completed, ING said today.  ING said the sale will free up about 1 billion euros in
capital and boost its core tier 1 ratio by about 35 basis
points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The lender, which received 10 billion euros in aid from the
Netherlands, said it has returned 7 billion euros, plus 2
billion euros in interest and premiums.  Frans Middendorff, a spokesman for ING, declined to comment
on the pricing for the stock sale.  To contact the reporters on this story:
