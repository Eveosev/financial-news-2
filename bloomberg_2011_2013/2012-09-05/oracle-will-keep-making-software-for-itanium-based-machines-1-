Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  said it will continue
to develop software for computers that run on  Intel Corp. (INTC) ’s
Itanium microprocessors, following a judge’s ruling that the
company is contractually obligated to do so.  The Redwood City, California-based company previously said
it would stop making new versions of its software for Itanium
chips. Last month, a California judge agreed with Hewlett-
Packard Co., a maker of Itanium-based machines, that Oracle made
a commitment to support its servers running the chips. Oracle
said at the time that it would appeal the ruling.  Hewlett-Packard sued Oracle in 2011, accusing the software
maker of violating a portion of former Hewlett-Packard Chief
Executive Officer Mark Hurd’s separation agreement describing a
“reaffirmation of the Oracle-HP partnership.” One month after
Hurd’s forced resignation in 2010, he was hired by Oracle CEO
 Larry Ellison  to serve as co-president of the largest database-
software maker. Oracle denied the claims.  Software for Hewlett-Packard’s Itanium computers will be
rolled out on about the same schedule as programs for
 International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) ’s Power Systems, Oracle
said today in a statement.  Michael Thacker, a Hewlett-Packard spokesman, had no
immediate comment on the ruling.  The case is Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Oracle Corp., 11-
cv-203163, California Superior Court, Santa Clara County (San
Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
