Maria Sharapova  advanced to the
women’s semifinals at the U.S. Open today with a three-set
defeat of Marion Bartoli in a match that started yesterday and
was interrupted by rain.  Sharapova, seeded third, won the U.S. Open in 2006 and will
be returning to the semfinals for the first time since then. The
25-year-old Russian’s next opponent will be top-seeded Victoria
Azarenka, 23, of Belarus.  Sharapova won 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 against the 27-year-old
Bartoli, from France, the 11th seed.  Sara Errani, 25, the 10th seed, will face either No. 4
 Serena Williams  of the U.S. or No. 12 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia in
the other semifinal.  Errani won 6-2, 6-4 earlier today against fellow Italian
Roberta Vinci, the 20th seed. Williams and Ivanovic are
scheduled to play tonight.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
