Spanish 10-year bonds advanced for a
third day as officials said the  European Central Bank ’s
government bond-buying proposal involves unlimited purchases,
boosting demand for the debt of so-called peripheral nations.  Germany’s 10-year bunds dropped after the nation received
bids for less than its maximum target at an auction. Spanish
two-year notes fell before the country sells as much as 3.5
billion euros ($4.4 billion) of securities due between 2014 and
2016 tomorrow. The Frankfurt-based ECB, led by President  Mario Draghi , will refrain from setting a public cap on yields,
according to three officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.  “It’s positive news, and the  bond market  is reacting to
that,” said Marchel Alexandrovich, a senior European economist
at Jefferies International Ltd. in  London . “There was some
concern that Draghi won’t be able to provide any details on a
bond-buying program at all, but this report suggested that there
will be at least some guidelines. That’s better than nothing.”  Spanish 10-year yields dropped 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 6.42 percent at 4:08 p.m. London time. The
5.85 percent security maturing in January 2022 rose 0.99, or
9.90 euros per 1,000-euro face amount, to 96.015.  The nation’s  two-year yield  advanced five basis points to
3.12 percent.  The ECB would refrain from setting a public cap on yields,
according to the officials. The plan will only focus on
 government bonds  rather than a broader range of assets and will
target short-dated maturities of up to about three years, two of
the people said.  Relative Strength  The  14-day relative strength index  for Spanish notes, which
tracks momentum by comparing closing prices with daily trading
ranges, was 68, after reaching 68.5 yesterday, the highest since
March. The 70-level indicates an asset may be “overbought” and
has risen too quickly.  Volatility on Italian government debt was the highest among
developed markets, followed by  Spain , according to measures of
10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10- year securities,
and credit default swaps.  Italian two-year rates climbed seven basis points to 2.44
percent, trimming eight days of declines.  Spain is scheduled to sell notes due in April 2014
tomorrow. It last sold the securities on June 21 at an average
yield of 4.71 percent. The nation also plans to auction debt
maturing in July 2015 and October 2016.  France  plans to sell
bonds due in 2017, 2022 and 2027.  “There’s pressure at the front-end of the Spanish curve
before the short-dated debt sales tomorrow,” said  Richard McGuire . “They rallied so strongly on the ECB expectations.”  German Auction  Germany got bids for 3.93 billion euros of the 10-year
bonds it sold today, less than its 5 billion-euro maximum sales
target, according to a Bundesbank statement. Germany sold the
securities at an average yield of 1.42 percent, the same rate as
the last sale on Aug. 8. That compares with a record low auction
yield of 1.31 percent on July 11.  “The result of the auction is a reflection of how tough
the market is ahead of the big event tomorrow,” said  Luca Jellinek , head of European  interest-rate  strategy at Credit
Agricole Corporate & Investment Bank in London. “We don’t know
what the ECB will say and no one wants to build a huge position
ahead of that.”  The yield on  Germany ’s 10-year bund maturing in September
2022 sold today rose two basis points to 1.46 percent. The extra
 yield  investors demand to hold U.S. Treasury 10-year notes
instead of similar-maturity bunds narrowed to 11 basis points,
the least since July 26. As recently as Aug. 24, Treasuries
yielded 33 basis points more than bunds.  ECB Decision  The ECB will cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis
points to 0.50 percent tomorrow, according to the median
forecast of 58 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. Spanish and
Italian notes have rallied since Draghi said on July 26 that he
would do “whatever it takes” to preserve the monetary union.
Spain’s two-year yields have fallen from a euro-era high of 7.15
percent on July 25.  “I am looking for details tomorrow on which bonds the ECB
might buy,” said  Peter Schaffrik , head of European interest-
rate strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in London. “The rally can
go on. Spanish and Italian two-year yields can reach 2
percent.”  German government bonds returned 3.7 percent this year
through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg
and the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.
Spanish bonds have fallen 2.2 percent and Italian debt has
returned 12 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
