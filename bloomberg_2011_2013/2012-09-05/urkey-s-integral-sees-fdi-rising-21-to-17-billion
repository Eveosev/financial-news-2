Turkey  will have 21 percent more
foreign direct investment next year in anticipation of Europe
making structural changes and the country’s sovereign rating
being upgraded to investment grade, brokerage Integral Menkul
Degerler said.  Foreign direct investment flows into Turkey may rise to $17
billion in 2013 from an expected $14 billion this year, Cenk
