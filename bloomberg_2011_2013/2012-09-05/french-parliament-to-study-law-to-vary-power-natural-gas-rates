The French parliament will study as
early as this month a proposed law to create power and natural-
gas tariffs that vary based on amounts used, a lawmaker said.  So-called progressive rates are designed to promote energy
savings and help low-income households pay for energy, Francois Brottes said today in a statement. Households using the least
energy and greatest efficiency will have the lowest rates.  Under the law, they will be given a  base rate  for power and
natural gas depending on how many people live on the premises,
where it is located in France, and the type of heating used,
Brottes said. The rate will apply to 80 percent of homes.  The law will increase to 4 million the number of households
considered to be in a “difficult situation” to pay their power
and gas bills compared with the 600,000 that are now benefitting
from so-called social rates, according to the statement.  Energy costs and dependence on atomic power were among the
main campaign themes of this year’s presidential election won by
Socialist Francois Hollande. The French government regulates
rates for power and gas. Gaz de  France  SA has challenged natural
gas rates in court, saying they don’t cover costs.  During the campaign, Hollande also promised a new rate
system for water, which isn’t included in the proposed law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
