Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Latin
America’s largest company by market value, is reviewing its
investment in a joint natural-gas project with  Repsol SA (REP)  in  Peru 
as it focuses spending on oil reserves in Brazil.  Petrobras, as the company is known, “is reviewing its
investments in Block 57” to determine what will be done with
the project’s output, the company’s press office said in an e-
mailed response to questions yesterday. The Rio de Janeiro-based
company is divesting assets to focus on developing its offshore
oil reserves after reporting its first quarterly  loss  in 13
years in the second quarter.  Repsol, which operates the project, extended a deadline for
Petrobras to make a payment for the project after it failed to
do so on time last month, an official at one of the companies,
who can’t be named because the information isn’t public, said in
a telephone interview yesterday.  Block 57 is located in Peru’s Amazonian jungle, where
Repsol and Petrobras are developing the Kinteroni  gas field . The
field was expected to begin producing gas in the fourth quarter,
with gross production capacity of 5 million cubic meters,
Madrid-based Repsol  said  in July.  Kristian Rix, a Repsol spokesman, declined to comment
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
