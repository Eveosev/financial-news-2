Gold prices may climb to $2,000 an
ounce by the end of the year because the  Federal Reserve 
probably will announce a third round of bond buying, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch analysts Sabine Schels and  Michael Widmer 
said in an e-mailed report today.  “Loose monetary policies with a scope for more aggressive
balance-sheet use in the U.S. and Europe will keep real rates in
most reserve currencies low (or negative) in 2012,” the
analysts said. “We continue to believe this will allow
investor demand for gold to remain strong.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
