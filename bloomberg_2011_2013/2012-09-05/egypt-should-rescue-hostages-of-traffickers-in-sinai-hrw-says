Egypt should work to free hundreds
of captives held for ransom by criminals in the eastern Sinai
Peninsula, as the country conducts military operations there
after last month’s deadly attacks,  Human Rights Watch  said.  “Thousands of sub-Saharan asylum seekers and migrants
attempting to cross the Sinai have fallen victim to abusive
traffickers and other criminals,”  Joe Stork , deputy director of
the  Middle East  and North Africa division of the New York-based
group, said in a statement e-mailed today. “Egypt’s new
government should use its increased law enforcement operations
to rescue victims of trafficking and end these abuses.”  Egypt’s army and police forces have launched a long-term
operation in the peninsula after 16 Egyptian border guards were
killed on Aug. 5 by unidentified militants who attacked a
security post.  To contact the reporter on this story:
