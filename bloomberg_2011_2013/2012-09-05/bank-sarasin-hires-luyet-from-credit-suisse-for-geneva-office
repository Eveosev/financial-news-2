Bank Sarasin & Cie. (BSAN) , the Swiss
wealth manager controlled by Safra Group, hired Frederic Luyet
from Credit Suisse Group AG as head of private banking for
French-speaking Switzerland.  Luyet, 52, will lead a team of more than 20 client
relationship managers as the firm plans a “significant
expansion” in the market, Sarasin said in an e-mailed
 statement . A Swiss citizen, Luyet previously worked in private
banking for Credit Suisse and UBS AG, the country’s largest
banks.  “This is a clear sign of Bank Sarasin’s commitment to both
its home market and the location of Geneva,” Bas Rijke, head of
the Geneva office, said in the statement.  Sarasin reported July 30 a 27 percent decline in first-half
profit and said private clients banking in  Switzerland  withdrew
1.2 billion francs ($1.25 billion) in the first six months while
customers elsewhere in  Europe  added funds.  Safra, which managed about $101 billion at the end of 2011
and has banks in  Brazil , the U.S. and Switzerland, completed its
acquisition of a controlling stake in Sarasin last month and has
offered to buy minority shareholders’ interests. Jacob Safra,
the Geneva-based vice-chairman of J. Safra Holding AG, joined
Sarasin’s board of directors last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
