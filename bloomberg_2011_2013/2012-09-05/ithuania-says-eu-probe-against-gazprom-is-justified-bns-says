Lithuanian Energy Minister Arvydas Sekmokas said the European Union’s antitrust probe into  Gazprom
OAO (GAZP)  operations in eastern and central  Europe  is “justified,”
the  Baltic News Service  reported today.  “I can confirm that we have asked the European Commission
to look into possible abuse of the European competition rules
over unfair pricing and I believe the probe is justified,”
Sekmokas was quoted as saying by the BNS. “Gazprom must assess
the current situation and react.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
