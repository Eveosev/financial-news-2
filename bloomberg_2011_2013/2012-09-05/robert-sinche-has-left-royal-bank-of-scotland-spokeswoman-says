Robert Sinche has left Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc where he was  global head  of foreign-exchange
strategy, a spokeswoman for the company said today.  Stamford , Connecticut-based Sinche departed to “pursue
interests outside the bank,” Anita Berthier wrote in an e-
mailed response to questions. “We wish him well,” she said.  Sinche, 60, joined RBS in 2010 from Lily Pond Capital
Management LLC in New York where he was chief strategist. He
previously worked at companies including Bank of America Corp.,
Citigroup Inc., Prudential Investment Corp., Alliance Capital
Ltd., Bear Stearns Cos., and Paine Webber Group Inc.  Sinche, who has more than 30 years of experience in foreign-
exchange markets, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  He said in interviews with Bloomberg in July that he saw a
more positive outlook for the dollar over the next two to three
years. Sinche predicted that the euro may weaken to $1.15 by the
middle of next year. The 17-nation currency traded at $1.2615 at
11:21 a.m. in New York.  Sinche ranked first in foreign-exchange research in the
2004 Euromoney magazine poll of currency investors.  He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in economics from
Hamilton College and holds a master’s degree in economics from
 Brown University .  To contact the reporter on this story:
