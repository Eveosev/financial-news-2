All Nippon Airways Co. (9202)  canceled a
 Boeing Co. (BA)  787 flight to  Tokyo ’s Haneda from Okayama, western
Japan, before takeoff today because of a hydraulic-oil leak from
an engine.  Japan’s largest carrier has dispatched two engineers to
replace the part responsible for the oil leak, spokeswoman
Megumi Tezuka said by telephone. There were no injuries from the
incident, which caused the oil to turn into a white mist, Tezuka
said.  The problem is separate from a case in July when ANA, which
became the first 787 operator last year, grounded five of the
planes to replace gear parts in their  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/) 
Trent 1000 engines, she said. The carrier replaced the parts
after the manufacturer discovered they had a shorter service
life than expected.  ANA fell 0.6 percent to 166 yen at the close of trading in
Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average dropped 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
