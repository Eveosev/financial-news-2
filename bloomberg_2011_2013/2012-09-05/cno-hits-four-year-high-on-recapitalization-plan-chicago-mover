CNO Financial Group Inc. (CNO) , the life
insurer that counts  John Paulson ’s hedge fund as its largest
investor, reached a four-year high after announcing a
recapitalization plan that may boost per-share profit.  CNO gained 5.5 percent to close at $9.45 in New York, the
highest since July 2008. The Carmel, Indiana-based firm has
advanced 50 percent this year.  The insurer is seeking $950 million of loans and bonds to
repay debt and cut borrowing costs, CNO said yesterday in a
statement. As part of a repurchase of convertible debentures,
CNO’s diluted share count will fall by 36.4 million. The
reduction would have increased earnings per share by 9 percent
as of June 30, according to the statement.  “The deal should optimize the company’s debt leverage,”
 Randy Binner , an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, wrote in a
research note yesterday. “CNO is a compelling value play in our
opinion with an in-progress capital management story.”  CNO plans to obtain senior secured credit consisting of a
$400 million, six-year  term loan  and a $250 million portion that
matures in four years, the firm said in yesterday’s statement.
CNO also plans to sell $250 million of notes due in 2020 and is
seeking a $50 million, three-year revolving  credit line .  Proceeds and cash will be used to repay $224 million on a
senior secured credit agreement, repurchase as much as $275
million in senior notes due in 2018, buy back about $200 million
of its convertible notes due in 2016 and pay expenses related to
the transactions, the firm said. CNO will take a $161 million
charge in the third quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
