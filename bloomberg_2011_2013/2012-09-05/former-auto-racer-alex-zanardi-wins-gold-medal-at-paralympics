Former racing driver Alex Zanardi,
who lost both of his legs in a 2001 crash, won a gold medal in
hand-cycling at the  London Paralympics , where  Oscar Pistorius 
secured his first title of the 2012 games.  Zanardi, 45, took the men’s individual time-trial in 24
minutes, 50.22 seconds over the 16-kilometer course at Brands
Hatch. The victory came on the same circuit in Kent, southeast
 England , the Italian had driven during his auto racing career.  “It’s at the top of the scale with the many other great
moments I’ve been lucky enough to live,” said Zanardi, who
lifted his bike above his head in celebration after his victory.  China increased its lead in the  medal standings  to 60 golds
and 159 medals in total after eight of 12 days of competition.
Russia is second with 28 golds among its 73 medals. Britain has
25 gold medals, followed by Ukraine and  Australia  with 22 each.  The games run through Sept. 9, with more than 4,000
athletes from 164 teams competing in a series of classes
depending on their impairment.  Zanardi won two driver titles in the Championship Auto
Racing Teams series in the U.S. after joining from Formula One
in 1995. He was critically injured and had both legs amputated
after crashing in a 2001 race in  Germany .  Zanardi returned to driving in touring cars with hand
controls before turning his attention to hand-cycling, winning
the category at the 2011  New York  Marathon.  Pistorius Rebounds  Pistorius, 25, anchored South Africa’s 400-meter sprint
relay team to victory in the T42/T46 event in a world-record
time of 41.78 seconds at the Olympic Stadium.  “We smashed that world record,” Pistorius told reporters.
“I said to the guys to stay calm and focused.”  Known as the “ Blade Runner ,” Pistorius suffered an upset
defeat to  Brazil ’s Alan Fonteles Cardoso Oliveira in the 200-
meter T44 final four days ago. The pair will race again in
tonight’s 100-meter T44 final, where Pistorius will defend the
title he won in Beijing four years ago.  Britain’s Sarah Storey won her third cycling gold medal of
the games, and 10th of her career, in the women’s C5 time-trial
at Brands Hatch yesterday. The 34-year-old also won two gold
medals in track cycling in London.  Swedish shooter Jonas Jacobsson, the most-decorated male
Paralympian, successfully defended his title in the men’s 50-
meter rifle 3 positions SH1 event. The 47-year-old has 30 medals
and 17 golds in nine appearances at the games.  To contact the reporter on this story:
