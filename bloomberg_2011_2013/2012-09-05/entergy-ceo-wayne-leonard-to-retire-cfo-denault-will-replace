Entergy Corp. (ETR) , owner of the second-
largest group of U.S. nuclear reactors, said Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Wayne Leonard will retire on Jan. 31 and be
replaced by Chief Financial Officer Leo Denault.  Leonard, 61, was the longest-serving CEO in Entergy’s
history, taking the role in January 1999, the New Orleans-based
company said in a statement today.  During Leonard’s tenure, the utility owner survived
 Hurricane Katrina , added nuclear power plants in the Northeast
and Midwest and abandoned a multibillion-dollar merger plan with
 NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE) , then known as FPL Group Inc.  Denault, 52, has been with the company since 1999 and been
CFO since 2004. He’ll be replaced in that position by Andrew
Marsh, currently vice president of system planning for the
company.  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  owns the largest number of U.S. reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
