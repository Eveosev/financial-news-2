Japan  stocks  declined a fifth day,
the longest losing streak in two months, as economic reports
from the U.S. and China added to signs global growth is slowing
ahead of tomorrow’s  European Central Bank  meeting.  Nissan Motor  Co., Japan’s second-largest automaker, dropped
1.9 percent as its vehicle sales in the U.S. missed estimates.
Komatsu Ltd., a maker of construction equipment that gets about
14 percent of its sales from China, slid 3.5 percent on a report
mainland industrial output may slow.  Chubu Electric Power Co. (9502) 
rose 2.4 percent to lead gains on the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average
after forecasting a narrower first-half loss.  The Nikkei 225 lost 1.1 percent to 8,679.82 at 3 p.m. in
Tokyo, closing at the lowest level since Aug. 3. The five-day
decline was the longest losing streak since July. The broader
Topix Index slid 1.2 percent to 718.09 today. The ECB’s
Governing Council is due to decide tomorrow on President  Mario
Draghi ’s bond-buying proposal, which he says is necessary to
ensure the monetary bloc’s survival.  “The macro backdrop is quite challenging and growth
conditions are fragile obviously,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-
based head of dynamic  asset allocation  at AMP Capital Investors
Ltd., which manages almost $100 billion. “The market is getting
nervous about going into the ECB meeting. There’s a lot of
speculation on the ECB about what they will do.”  The Topix dropped 18 percent from this year’s peak on March
27 on concern Europe’s debt crisis is deepening and growth is
slowing in China and the U.S. The gauge trades at 0.9 times book
value, compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. A number less than one means
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  U.S. Manufacturing  Futures on the  S&P 500  slid 0.4 percent today. The gauge
fell 0.1 percent yesterday after  Institute for Supply
Management ’s U.S. data showed U.S. manufacturing shrank for a
third month in August, the longest decline since the recession
ended in 2009.  Exporters to the U.S. declined.  Canon Inc. (7751) , a camera maker
that gets 27 percent of sales from the U.S., lost 3.9 percent to
2,463 yen. Sony Corp., Japan’s biggest exporter of consumer
electronics, slipped 3 percent to 863 yen.  Nissan Motor dropped 1.9 percent to 722 yen. The
automaker’s deliveries in the U.S. increased 7.6 percent last
month, according to researcher Autodata Corp., short of the 12
percent average estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Companies that do business in China fell on signs of a
deepening slowdown. Komatsu dropped 3.5 percent to 1,475 yen.
Fanuc Corp., a maker of industrial robots, slipped 2 percent to
12,550.  China Outlook  The nation’s growth in industrial output may slow to about
10 percent this year from 13.9 percent last year and 15.7
percent in 2010, the Securities Times newspaper reported today,
citing a joint report by the Ministry of Industry and
 Information Technology  and the  Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences . Adding to signs of slowdown, China’s services
industries expanded at a weaker pace in August, according to a
survey released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today.  Among stocks that rose, Chubu Electric gained 2.4 percent
to 909 yen. The utility said it expected its first-half loss to
narrow 79 percent to 4 billion yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
