Slovakia’s Economy Ministry
recommended granting  Continental AG (CON)  tax breaks worth 4.5 million
euros ($5.7 million) after  Europe ’s second-largest auto-parts
maker expanded production in the country.  The company has spent 25 million euros to add production of
brake components in its existing factory in Zvolen, central
Slovakia, according to a  document  posted on the government
website today. The project will create 500 new jobs, the
ministry said.  By expanding facilities in Slovakia, the Hanover, Germany-
based manufacturer seeks to benefit from lower labor costs than
western Europe as well as the country’s euro-area membership.
The Slovak government has yet to discuss the proposal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
