Safeway Inc. (SWY) , the second-largest
grocery chain in the U.S., is planning an initial public
offering of a minority stake in its Blackhawk Network Holdings
Inc. business.  The transaction may take place in the first half of 2013,
depending on market conditions, Pleasanton, California-based
Safeway said in a statement today. Blackhawk provides prepaid
products, such as restaurant gift cards, to retail and grocery
stores in the U.S.,  Canada , Europe, Mexico and Australia.  Blackhawk is “an undervalued asset within the company,”
 Charles Cerankosky , a Cleveland-based analyst at Northcoast
Research Holdings LLC, said in an interview. The business
generates at least $100 million in earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization, he said.  The load value, or purchase amount put on gift cards,
increased 25 percent in 2011 to $6.9 billion, William Tauscher,
chairman and chief executive officer of Blackhawk, said at an
investor conference in March. Profit at Safeway, which is facing
more competition from big-box retailers and dollar stores, fell
12 percent last year and may drop about 5.7 percent this year,
according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Safeway, which operates 1,666 stores in the U.S. and
Canada, rose 4.3 percent to $16.50 at the close in  New York , for
the biggest gain since Nov. 30. The  shares  have fallen 22
percent this year.  Kroger Co. (KR)  is the largest grocery-store chain in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
