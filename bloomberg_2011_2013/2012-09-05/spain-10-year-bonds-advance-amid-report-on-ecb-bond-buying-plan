Spanish 10-year  government bonds 
advanced as two officials said the European Central Bankâ€™s bond-
buying proposal involves unlimited purchases of government debt.  Ten-year yields declined four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 6.53 percent at 1:24 p.m. London time,
after rising as much as seven basis points. Two-year notes
stayed lower, with the yield climbing six basis points to 3.13
percent.  The Frankfurt-based ECB would refrain from setting a public
cap on yields, according to the people, and a third official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
