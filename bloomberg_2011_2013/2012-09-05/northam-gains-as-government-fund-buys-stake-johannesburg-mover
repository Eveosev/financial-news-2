Northam Platinum Ltd. (NHM) , operator of
the deepest mine for the metal, climbed to the highest in almost
three months as a South African government fund acquired an
additional stake.  The stock gained as much as 5.9 percent to 29.29 rand, the
highest level since June 11, and traded at 28.80 rand as of 3:33
p.m. in Johannesburg, where the company is based. Northam said
the Public Investment Corp., on behalf of the Government
Employees Pension Fund, acquired an interest in the company,
raising its holding to 18.9 percent.  Northam said Aug. 3 that a recent share price decline
forced black investor groups Afripalm (Pty) Ltd. and Mvelaphanda
Holdings (Pty) Ltd. to sell Northam stock to restore compliance
with covenants set by lenders. The company said at the time that
the government required it to “urgently restore” its
shareholding by black groups. Mining companies operating in
 South Africa  are required to have black investors to help make
up for apartheid.  Northam said Afripalm unit Newshelf 848 sold 37,248,400
shares. The company didn’t quantify the PIC’s purchase. The GEPF
held 8.3 percent as of July 27, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
