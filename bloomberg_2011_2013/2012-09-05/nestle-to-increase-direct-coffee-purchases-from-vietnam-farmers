Nestle SA (NESN) , the world’s largest food
company, plans to boost so-called direct purchases of coffee
from farmers in  Vietnam  by as much as five times over the next
half decade to improve quality as demand increases.  Nestle Vietnam Ltd . may buy about 60,000 metric tons from
growers a year by then, compared with 12,000 to 14,000 tons this
year, Managing Director Rashid Qureshi said in an interview
yesterday. The local unit of the Vevey, Switzerland-based
company started direct buying late last year, he said.  Vietnam, the biggest coffee exporter after  Brazil , is the
largest shipper of robusta beans that are used to make instant
drinks. At present, Nestle buys 200,000 tons to 250,000 tons of
Vietnamese coffee a year, Qureshi said. The 2011-2012 harvest
was a record 1.55 million tons, according to a Bloomberg survey.  “Shortening the  supply chain  to reach more directly to
farmers will improve the growers’ income, as well as
traceability of the coffee,” Qureshi said in Hanoi. “We can
train them, help them increase yield and quality of coffee.”  Production in Vietnam in the season ending this month may
gain 7.9 percent to 21 million, 60-kilogram (132 pound) bags,
the  International Coffee Organization  said yesterday. The gain
helped the group raise its estimate for worldwide coffee output
in 2011-2012 to 132.7 million bags from an earlier call of 131.4
million bags and last year’s harvest of 134.3 million bags.  Robusta futures have gained 14 percent to $2,071 a metric
ton on NYSE Liffe in  London  this year as roasters use more of
the cheaper grade. Costlier arabica has declined 27 percent on
ICE Futures U.S. in  New York  in 2012.  Dak Lak  Nestle invested in a procurement center in  Dak Lak , the
main coffee-growing region, and set up a mill there to process
beans, he said. Coffee consumption in Vietnam may double over
the next decade, and Nestle’s sales of coffee products may see
double-digit growth every year in the period, he said.  Nestle will start producing soluble coffee, mainly for
local sale, at a $270 million plant in Dong Nai province in
November after a first phase of construction is completed,
Qureshi said. A second phase will be finished next year, with
production of decaffeinated coffee planned for export, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
