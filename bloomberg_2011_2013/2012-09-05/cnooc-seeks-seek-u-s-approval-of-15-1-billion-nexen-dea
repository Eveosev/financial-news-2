Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s biggest offshore
oil and gas explorer, asked the U.S. government to review its
$15.1 billion offer for Canada’s  Nexen Inc. (NXY) , Cnooc said today.  The voluntary submission was made to the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States, Peter Hunt, a CNOOC
spokesman, said in a phone interview, declining to say when the
company made the filing.  The committee, known as CFIUS and chaired by Treasury
Secretary  Timothy Geithner , reviews foreign takeovers of U.S.
companies on national security grounds.  Cnooc, owned by the Chinese government and based in Beijing,
agreed July 23 to pay $15.1 billion for Nexen, a Calgary-based
company that operates in the U.S. portion of the Gulf of Mexico.  A Nexen takeover would mark the first time a Chinese
company would be the operator of U.S. leases in those waters
instead of a minority stakeholder. Nexen also has operations in
Canada’s oil sands, the U.K. North Sea and Nigeria.  Cnooc and Nexen said in a July 24 filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that they intend to put the
deal to CFIUS for review.  CNOOC applied for approval from the Canadian government on
Aug. 29.  To contact the reporters on this story:
