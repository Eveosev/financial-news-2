Spain  had its second-hottest August
since 1961 and the month was also the third-driest as a pattern
of above-normal warmth and lower-than-usual rainfall continues,
the  Agriculture Ministry ’s weather service reported.  Temperatures were an average 25.4 degrees Celsius (77.7
degrees Fahrenheit) last month, 2 degrees above normal, the
ministry wrote in a  report  on its website today. Only 2003 was
warmer in the past 51 years, according to the ministry. Rainfall
in August was 9 millimeters (0.35 inch) on average compared with
24 millimeters normally.  The heat and drought follows warmer and drier conditions
than usual in July, an “extremely warm” June and below-normal
rainfall in May. April was the only month this year that was
wetter than usual, after the December-to-February period was the
driest since at least 1947, according to ministry data.  Temperatures peaked at 45.9 degrees Celsius at Seville
airport on Aug. 11 and 44.5 degrees Celsius at Cordoba airport,
the ministry wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
