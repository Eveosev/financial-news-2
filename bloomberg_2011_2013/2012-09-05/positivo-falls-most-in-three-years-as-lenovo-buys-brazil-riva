Positivo Informatica SA (POSI3) , Brazil’s
biggest computer maker, fell the most in three years after
China’s  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) ’s agreement to buy a rival electronics
maker ended speculation it would be acquired.  Positivo slumped as much as 15 percent, the most since
February 2009, and traded 12 percent lower at 5.52 reais as of
12:25 p.m. in Sao Paulo.  The shares had surged 14 percent yesterday on speculation
it would be bought after Lenovo, the world’s second-largest
computer maker, said in a statement that Chief Executive Officer
 Yang Yuanqing  would make the “biggest announcement in the
company’s history in Brazil” today. Lenovo will buy consumer-
electronics makers Digiboard, Digibras and Dual Mix, a group
known as CCE, according to a regulatory filing today.  “That was a big disappointment to investors, who expected
some kind of agreement with Positivo,” Marcelo Varejao, an
analyst at brokerage Socopa, said by phone from Sao Paulo.
“Rumors about Lenovo’s interest in the Brazilian computer maker
had been running in the market for quite some time.”  Positivo had risen 9 percent this year through yesterday,
while the benchmark Bovespa stock index declined 0.9 percent
during that same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
