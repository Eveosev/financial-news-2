Andy Roddick ’s tennis career ended
with a four-set loss today to Juan Martin Del Potro in the
fourth round of the U.S. Open.  Roddick, 30, the last American man to win a Grand Slam
tennis tournament when he captured the 2003 U.S. Open
championship, lost 6-7 (1-7), 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-4 to Del Potro,
the 2009 U.S. Open champion from  Argentina .  Roddick, seeded 20th, said last week that he would retire
at the end of the tournament. He won two matches after making
that announcement, and entered today’s contest against the
seventh-seeded Del Potro with an 8-0 record in fourth-round
matches at the National Tennis Center in  New York .  Roddick won more than $20 million in a career that 
included 32 tournament titles. He was ranked No. 1 in the world
in 2003.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
