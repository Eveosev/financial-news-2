Spot gasoline in  California  slipped
against futures after  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  reported a unit startup at
the Golden Eagle refinery and said the Los Angeles plant was
resuming operations following a power disruption.  Tesoro’s 170,000-barrel-a-day Golden Eagle refinery in
Northern California reported a “major unit startup” over the
weekend, a notice e-mailed by the Contra Costa County hazardous
materials division yesterday showed. The company’s 97,000-
barrel-a-day Los Angeles plant was returning units to normal
operation after a “power dip” yesterday, said Tina Barbee, a
spokeswoman at Tesoro headquarters in  San Antonio .  The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
San Francisco fell 3.5 cents to 24.5 cents a gallon versus
gasoline futures traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at
1:47 p.m. East Coast time, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
same fuel in  Los Angeles  also dropped 3.5 cents to 24.5 cents a
gallon above futures.  The Golden Eagle and Los Angeles refineries “continue to
meet all product supply commitments,” Barbee said by e-mail.  California-blend, or CARB, diesel in San Francisco tumbled
5 cents to 31.5 cents a gallon above Nymex heating oil futures,
falling from a record high. CARB diesel in Los Angeles slipped 1
cent to 29 cents a gallon over futures.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in  Portland ,  Oregon ,
dropped 4 cents to a premium of 30.5 cents a gallon versus
gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel in Portland weakened 0.5
cent to 30.5 cents a gallon above heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
