Ethanol fell to an eight-week low in
 Chicago  on signs of adequate supply and more imports.  Futures declined with  stockpiles  in the most recent Energy
Department report at 18.5 million barrels, up 3.4 percent from a
year earlier, and as  imports  this year have averaged 16,000
barrels a day, up from 6,200 a day for all of 2011.  “We did some selling out the gate in ethanol and it didn’t
have a chance to recover,” said Mike Blackford, a consultant at
INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,  Iowa . “You’ve never really been
forced this year to go out and really scramble for ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 3.5 cents, or
1.4 percent, to $2.528 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade
today, the lowest settlement since July 12. Futures have gained
15 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol slipped 5.5 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.62 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel fell
5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.595, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows.  Ethanol in  New York  sank 5.5 cents, or 2.1 percent, to
$2.62 a gallon and in Chicago the additive slid 4.5 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $2535.  Blackford said demand may be tempered as refineries in the
U.S. Gulf start production after being forced to close because
of Hurricane Isaac.  The biofuel is blended with gasoline to stretch supply and
meet federal mandates. Refiners also mix the fuel in an effort
to capture the spread between the two.  Ethanol traded at a 42.18-cent  discount  to the motor fuel
today, up from yesterday’s 38.92 cents.  Gasoline for October delivery fell 0.24 cent to $2.9498 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Corn for December delivery tumbled 14.25 cents, or 1.8
percent, to $7.9075 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
