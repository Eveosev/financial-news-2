Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW) , the Internet
recruiting service that is exploring a sale, rose the most in
four months on speculation it may be making progress in the
search for a buyer.  The shares advanced 6.3 percent to $7.55 at the close in
New York. The stock has gained 8.8 percent since Feb. 29, the
day before Chief Executive Officer Salvatore Iannuzzi said he
would consider a sale.  “Speculation that the company is going to get sold is
fueling the stock,” said Eric Handler, an analyst at MKM
Partners LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut, in an interview today.
“With the product portfolio and the global footprint, I think
someone is out there who could extract value from the company.”  Potential buyers could include companies that specialize in
software for corporations, he said, such as  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) ,
 Oracle Corp. (ORCL) ,  Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) , and  SAP AG. (SAP)   News Corp. (NWSA)  might
also be interested in buying Monster to augment its online
classified advertising, Handler said.  Representatives from Monster, Microsoft, News Corp.,
Salesforce, Oracle and SAP declined to comment.  Monster said on March 5 that it hired Stone Key Partners
LLC and Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch to help it review
strategic alternatives.  To contact the reporter on this story:
