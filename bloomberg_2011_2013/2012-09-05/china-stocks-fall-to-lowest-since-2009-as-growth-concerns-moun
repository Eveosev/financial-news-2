China’s stock  indexes  fell, dragging
the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  to the lowest level since February
2009, on concern the economic slowdown is deepening.  Sany Heavy Industry Co. (600031)  slumped to the lowest level in two
years as the  Securities Times  reported China’s 2012 industrial
output growth may slow. China Minsheng Banking Corp. tumbled to
an 11-month low after JPMorgan Chase & Co. downgraded the stock
and Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. signaled rising non-performing
loans at Chinese lenders. China Vanke Co., the nation’s largest
publicly traded property company, rose to a two-week high after
August sales increased from July.  The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.3 percent to
2,037.68 at the close. The gauge pared an earlier loss of 0.7
percent as two shares gained for each one that fell. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  decreased 0.2 percent to 2,199.88. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
retreated 1.7 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of
the most-traded Chinese companies in the U.S. slumped 0.9
percent to 87.14 yesterday.  “Investors remain concerned about the economy and are
worried macro data will be weak,”  Zhang Gang , a strategist at
Central China Securities Holdings Co., said by phone in Shanghai
today. “They are hoping the government will come out with more
stimulus measures to boost the economy.”  Signs that China’s economic slowdown is deepening have
dragged the Shanghai Composite down 8.5 percent this quarter.
The gauge sank 2.7 percent in August, a  fourth straight month  of
declines. That’s the longest streak since the five months
through August 2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Industrial Output  A government purchasing managers index released last
weekend showed China’s manufacturing shrank for the first time
in nine months. Data showed yesterday that U.S. manufacturing
shrank for a third month in August in the longest decline since
the nation’s recession ended in 2009.  China’s 2012 industrial output growth may slow to about 10
percent, from 13.9 percent in 2011 and 15.7 percent in 2010,
Securities Times reported today, citing a joint report by the
Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  and the  Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences . The manufacturing industry is facing
weakening demand and production overcapacity, according to the
report.  Sany Heavy, China’s biggest machinery maker, slumped 3.7
percent to 8.95  yuan , the lowest close since Sept. 21, 2010.
 Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science & Technology Co. (000157) , the nation’s
second-biggest maker of construction equipment, retreated 1.3
percent to 7.86 yuan, the lowest close since Jan. 9.  Taiyuan
Heavy Industry Co. (600169)  sank 1.2 percent to 2.58 yuan, the lowest
close since Nov. 7, 2008.  Stimulus Tool  China may expand exporters’ tax rebates to help them cope
with a slump in trade growth, according to three people with
direct knowledge of the plan, deploying a stimulus tool used
during the global credit crunch.  The government may give a full rebate of the 17 percent
value-added tax on products including furniture, shoes and toys,
up from the current range of 13 percent to 15 percent, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions
are private. The policy may be rolled out as soon as this month,
depending on if trade remains weak, they said.  The  Shanghai  Composite trades at 9.2 times estimated
profit, near the lowest level since January, according to weekly
 data  compiled by Bloomberg. The measure’s 30-day volatility
reading was at 11.9, compared with this year’s average of 17.
About 5.7 billion shares changed hands in the gauge yesterday,
about 27 percent lower than the daily average this year.  Steelmakers’ Losses  A gauge of energy companies in the CSI 300 Index dropped
1.4 percent, the most of 10 industry groups.  Yanzhou Coal Mining
Co. (600188)  retreated 1.5 percent to 16.94 yuan, the lowest close since
July 15, 2010. The price of Shandong coking coal fell 10 percent
in the last week of August, Mizuho analyst Kelvin Ng said in a
phone interview, citing sxcoal.com data. China Shenhua Energy
Co., the nation’s largest coal producer, sank 1.9 percent to
21.04 yuan.  Angang Steel Co. (000898)  lost 2 percent to 3.37 yuan, the lowest
close since July 20, 2005. The combined July net loss for 80
large-to-medium-sized steel companies was 1.98 billion yuan
($312 million), China Business News reported, citing a document
from the China Iron and Steel Association.  China Minsheng Banking Corp. (600016)  dropped 3.7 percent to 5.47
yuan, the lowest close since October 2010, after it was cut to
neutral from overweight at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chinese banks’
overdue loans rose 29 percent in the first half, foreshadowing
an increase in non-performing loans, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.
analysts wrote in a note.  Industrial Bank Co. (601166)  lost 1.5 percent
to 11.94 yuan, the lowest close since July 26.  Higher Sales  A gauge of property companies in the Shanghai Composite
Index rose 1.2 percent, the biggest advance among five industry
groups, after China Vanke posted August sales of 11.35 billion
yuan, according to a statement to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.
Vanke had sales of 10.4 billion yuan in July, according to an
Aug. 3 statement.  Vanke shares climbed 1.1 percent to 8.32 yuan. Poly Real
Estate Group Co., the second-largest developer in  China ,
advanced 2.9 percent to 10.24 yuan.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., sank 1.8 percent yesterday,
the steepest slump since July 23. American depositary receipts
of  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd.  also known as Chalco, lost 3.1
percent to $9.36, the lowest level since Nov. 20, 2008.  The Beijing-based company said Sept. 3 it dropped its C$925
million ($937 million) bid for Mongolian coal producer SouthGobi
Resources Ltd. as it’s unlikely to win regulatory approval.
Chalco’s plans to acquire a stake in SouthGobi have been
hindered by the Mongolian government, which passed a law in May
restricting foreign state-owned companies from controlling key
assets. Chalco’s Shanghai-listed shares lost 1.4 percent to 4.97
yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
