The seller of adult films with
titles and packages based on Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Inc. flavors
agreed to pull them from the market.  Rodax Distributors Inc., which does business as Caballero
Video, yesterday agreed to a court order barring it from selling
its “Ben & Cherry’s” series of 10 DVDs with titles including
“Peanut Butter D-Cups” and “Boston Cream Thigh” while a
trademark suit is under way.  The order requires Caballero to recall the DVDs and to
destroy all products, labels and marketing materials that
infringe on Ben & Jerry’s trademarks.  Ben & Jerry’s, a unit of London-based  Unilever NV (UNA) , sued
Caballero in federal court in  New York  Sept. 5, claiming the
DVDs and packaging violated its trademarks. The packaging
featured images of naked men and women against backgrounds that
copy the design of Ben & Jerry’s ice cream containers such as
grazing cows and fluffy white clouds, the company said in its
complaint.  U.S. District Judge  Lewis Kaplan  issued a temporary
restraining order against Caballero on Sept. 6.  The case is Ben & Jerry’s Homemade Inc. v. Rodax
Distributors Inc., 12-CV-6734, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
