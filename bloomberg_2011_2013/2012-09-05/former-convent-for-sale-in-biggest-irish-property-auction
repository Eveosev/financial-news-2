A former convent outside of Dublin
with buildings dating back to 1845 will be offered next month in
the largest Irish property auction.  The former Sacred Heart convent, located 75 miles (123
kilometers) southwest of Dublin, is being put up for sale with a
minimum price of 100,000 euros ($125,000), according to Robert
Hoban, director of auctions at Allsop Space. The lot is among
130 properties that will be on sale at the Shelbourne Hotel in
Dublin on Oct. 3.  “We know a lot of the buyers are Irish living abroad who
emigrated 10, 20, 30 years ago, successful people who aren’t
affected by the recession,” Hoban said by telephone. U.K.
buyers attracted by rising rental yields in Dublin after the
country’s property boom ended are also investing, he said.  Dublin’s property market is showing “signs of life” after
 Europe ’s biggest property reduced the average value of
residential properties in the Irish capital by two thirds,
according to Dermot O’Leary, chief economist at  Goodbody
Stockbrokers . Even so, a lack of credit for home purchases and
oversupply in rural areas will probably push down prices
nationally this year and next, he said.  Georgian House  Other properties that will be offered in the auction
include a Georgian house in the center of Dublin for at least
850,000 euros and four neighboring houses in the city with a
minimum price of 360,000 euros, according to Hoban.  The average asking price for a home in Ireland at the peak
of the property bubble was 366,000 euros, according to property
website Daft.ie. It was 172,000 euros in the second quarter.  A duplex apartment in Dublin’s upmarket Donnybrook area is
also for sale at a minimum price of 295,000 euros. Allsop Space,
a venture between Allsop LLP and Irish property broker Space,
has sold 90 million euros of real estate at seven auctions since
April 2011. Past sales have included a medieval castle, an
unfinished housing estate and pubs and hotels in addition to
houses and apartments.  Cash buyers accounted for about 40 percent of home
purchases in auctions carried out by Sherry FitzGerald,
Ireland’s largest property broker, in the first six months. New
mortgage lending in the second quarter totaled 524 million
euros, 95 percent less than the quarterly peak in the third
quarter of 2006.  “There is not the cash locally to kick things off,”
according to Ronan Lyons, an economist with Daft.ie. “Hopefully
we can get international investors back into the Irish market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
