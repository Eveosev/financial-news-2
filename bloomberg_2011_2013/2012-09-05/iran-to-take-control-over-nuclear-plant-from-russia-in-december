Iran  will assume full control over
the Bushehr atomic power station Russia built at the end of
December, Russian state nuclear company Rosatom Corp. said.  Russia will continue to help Iran operate the countryâ€™s
first nuclear plant for three years because of a lack of trained
Iranian technicians, Rosatom said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
