Greece ’s state-controlled pension
funds saw the nominal value of their government bond holdings
drop 10.7 billion euros ($13.4 billion) after the country’s debt
swap earlier this year, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said.  It fell to 13 billion euros from 23.7 billion euros,
Stournaras, citing  Bank of Greece  data, said in a written
response to a lawmaker’s question distributed to reporters
yesterday.  Greece reduced its debt by about 100 billion euros when
bondholders agreed to the biggest sovereign restructuring in
history in March. The debt swap and bailouts from the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund aim to reduce Greek
debt to 120 percent of gross domestic product by 2020 from 165
percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
