Bioteq Environmental Technologies
Inc., a Vancouver-based company that treats industrial
wastewater, and Jiangxi Copper Co.,  China ’s largest copper
miner, agreed to build a water treatment plant in southeast
China.  The companies agreed in a joint venture to commit C$3.2
million ($3.2 million) to construct and operate the water
treatment plant at the Dexing mine site, Bioteq said today in a
statement.  The plant will be designed to treat as much as 24,000 cubic
meters of water a day. Annually, it’s expected to remove 900,000
pounds of copper from the environment in a form that can be
refined into useful products, Bioteq said. The copper
concentrate will be sold to Jiangxi Copper’s refinery at market
prices, minus transport and refining costs, it said.  Building is expected to be completed and the plant in
operation by July 2013, the company said.  “We are pleased to be working with Jiangxi Copper Co. to
address additional water treatment needs, meet environmental
requirements and maximize resource recovery at the Dexing
site,” Bioteq Chief Executive Officer Jonathan Wilkinson said
in the statement. It’s the fourth water treatment project
between BioteQ and Jiangxi Copper, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
