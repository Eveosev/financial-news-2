The  New York Jets  signed Robert
Malone and released T.J. Conley, changing punters four days
before they begin their National Football League campaign.  As the NFL season gets under way tonight with a game
between the defending Super Bowl-champion New York Giants and
the Dallas Cowboys, the Jets also re-signed defensive tackle
Marcus Dixon to their active roster, the team said in a
statement.  Malone, who spent training camp with the San Diego
Chargers, played in 12 games for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in
2010, averaging 41.5 yards on 52 punts. He also played one game
last season for the  Detroit Lions .  Conley played every game for the Jets last season, punting
92 times for a 42.7 yard average.  Dixon, waived by the Jets on Sept. 1, played in 19 games
for New York over the past two seasons, making 18 tackles and
2.5 sacks.  The Jets open their season at home against the  Buffalo
Bills  on Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
