BP Plc sold a  North Sea  Forties
crude cargo at the lowest price in more than four months. OAO
Lukoil sought to sell Russian Urals blend in the Mediterranean
without success.  Exports of North Sea Oseberg grade for October are planned
at eight cargoes of 600,000 barrels each, one more than this
month, a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  North Sea  BP sold Forties lot F0907 for Sept. 18 to Sept. 20 loading
to Lukoil at 75 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, the lowest
since April 19, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Platts trading window. BP sold one cargo
at a premium of 15 cents and another at a discount of 30 cents
on Aug. 31.  BP failed to sell a second consignment for Sept. 27 to
Sept. 29 at 20 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, unchanged
from its offer yesterday, the survey showed. Total SA didn’t
manage to buy the crude for Sept. 26 to Sept. 30 at 5 cents less
than Dated Brent, according to the survey.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time. Before the session,
Forties loading in 10 to 25 days was 26 cents a barrel less than
Dated Brent, the lowest since July 27, compared with a discount
of 14 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Brent for October settlement traded at $113.68 a barrel on
the ICE Futures  Europe  exchange in London at the close of the
window, down from $114.89 yesterday. The November contract was
$113.25, a 43 cent discount to October.  BP sold an Ekofisk cargo for Sept. 19 to Sept. 21 to
Trafigura Beheer BV at parity to Dated Bent and failed to sell a
second shipment of the blend for Sept. 22 to Sept. 24 at a
premium of 45 cents a barrel, the survey showed.  The London-based company didn’t find buyers for Oseberg
loading from Sept. 29 to Oct. 1 at 70 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent, according to the survey.  Nexen Inc. shut the Buzzard oil field, the biggest
contributor to Forties, yesterday for planned maintenance.  “Production has been shut in,” Patti Lewis, a Calgary-
based spokeswoman, said today in an e-mailed response to
questions from  Bloomberg News . “The maintenance turnaround
began yesterday, as scheduled.”  Mediterranean/Urals  Lukoil failed to sell 80,000 metric tons of Urals for Sept.
18 to Sept. 22 loading at 55 cents a barrel less than Dated
Brent, according to the survey. This compares with a discount of
70 cents for a trade on Aug. 23.  Urals advanced 6 cents to a discount of 76 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent for delivery in the Mediterranean, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Saudi Arabian Oil Co. cut its official selling price for
Arab Light to the Mediterranean to a discount of 90 cents for
October from a premium of 15 cents, according to a person
familiar with the pricing decision.  The state-owned producer, known as  Saudi Aramco , also
reduced the differential for Arab Light to northwest Europe, the
person said.  West Africa  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe rose 1 cent to $1.64 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
