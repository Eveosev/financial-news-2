A trustee representing Refco Inc.’s
foreign-exchange customers agreed to dismiss their last claim
against  Grant Thornton  LLP, the defunct firm’s former auditor
that clients accused of helping Refco defraud them.  The trustee, Marc Kirschner, sued a group of former Refco
executives and outside firms in 2007, claiming $500 million on
behalf of customers who lost money deposited with Refco  Capital
Markets . A judge in 2009 dismissed most of Kirschner’s claims
against Grant Thornton, Ernst & Young LLP and Mayer Brown LLP.  The parties agreed yesterday to drop the one remaining
claim, that Grant Thornton aided Refco in the fraud, after U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled the claim would be decided at
trial. No details of any settlement between the parties were
available from the court.  Refco, once the biggest independent U.S. futures trader,
was forced into bankruptcy in 2005 amid claims that executives
had schemed to hide more than a billion dollars in losses.
Former Refco Chief Executive Officer Phillip Bennett pleaded
guilty to fraud and conspiracy and is serving a 16-year prison
sentence.  The case is Kirschner v. Bennett, 07-cv-08165, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
