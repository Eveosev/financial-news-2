Kazakhstan, central Asia’s biggest
energy producer, doesn’t plan to cut borrowing costs this fall,
the central bank said.  “We don’t see any reason to further cut  interest rates  too
aggressively,” central bank Chairman Grigori Marchenko told
reporters today in Almaty. Grain prices are a “concern” as
they may stoke inflation, he said.  Policy makers trimmed the benchmark refinancing rate by
half a percentage point to 5.5 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
