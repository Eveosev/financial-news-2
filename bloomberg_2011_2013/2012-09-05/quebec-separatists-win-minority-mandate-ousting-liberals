Quebec ’s separatists will return to
power for the first time in nine years after winning a minority
mandate that will require them to seek support from opposition
parties to pass laws.  The CTV and TVA television networks projected the Parti
Quebecois would form a minority government in the French-
speaking province. The Liberals had been in power since 2003.  The PQ was leading in 59 of 125 electoral districts as of
9:36 p.m.  New York  time, with about 47 percent of polls
reporting, according to preliminary results posted by  Elections
Quebec . The  Liberal Party  was leading in 46 districts, with the
right-of-center Coalition Avenir Quebec ahead in 18. Quebec
Solidaire, another separatist party, could have two members in
the provincial legislature.  Today’s result may deprive Parti Quebecois leader Pauline Marois, who would become the first woman premier in Quebec
history, the mandate required to promote independence and start
her province toward another referendum on separation from
 Canada . Marois said last week it would be “very difficult” for
her to advance the separatist agenda at the desired pace without
a majority.  Preliminary results showed 33.2 percent of voters backed
the Parti Quebecois, compared with 30.6 percent for the Liberals
and 27.2 percent for the Coalition, Elections Quebec said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
