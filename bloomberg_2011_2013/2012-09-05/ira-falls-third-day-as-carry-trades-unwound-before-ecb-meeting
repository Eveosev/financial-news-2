The lira gained for the first time
in three days, erasing earlier losses, after a report that the
 European Central Bank ’s bond-buying program involves unlimited
purchase of government debt, bolstering risk sentiment. Bond
yields fell.  The lira strengthened less than 0.1 percent to 1.8190 at
5:02 p.m. in Istanbul, after weakening as much as 0.4 percent in
intraday trading. Yields on two-year benchmark debt retreated 3
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 7.60 percent,
declining for a second day.  The euro jumped half a cent to $1.2596 after a Bloomberg
report that the ECB would refrain from setting a public cap on
yields and sterilize bond purchases, according to two central
bank officials briefed on the plan. The plan will only focus on
 government bonds  rather than a broader range of assets and will
target short-dated maturities of up to about three years.  “The report was viewed as positive for risk sentiment,”
Emir Baruh, a currency trader at  Akbank TAS (AKBNK)  in Istanbul, said in
e-mailed comments.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  is expected to unveil details of
his bond-buying plan tomorrow at the bank’s monetary policy
meeting.  Turkey ’s central bank lent 2 billion liras ($1.09 billion)
at its lowest 5.75 percent policy rate today, compared with 3.5
billion liras provided a week earlier in the one-week repurchase
agreements auction.  Average borrowing costs for lenders fell to 6.41 percent on
Aug. 28, the cheapest since November. Funding costs were as high
as 8.74 percent in July and 11.93 percent in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
