Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Turkiye
Petrolleri AO, Turkey’s state oil and gas company, started
exploring for shale gas in the southeast of the country, Energy
Minister  Taner Yildiz  said.  Exploration began last week in Diyarbakir’s Saribugday-1
field, Yildiz said in Ankara during a meeting with Shell’s Chief
Executive Officer  Peter Voser , according to the state-owned
Anatolia news agency.  There may be 13 trillion cubic meters of shale gas
reserves, 1.8 trillion cubic meters of which is recoverable,
Ismail Bahtiyar, chairman of the Turkish Association of
Petroleum Geologists, said April 20.  Shell, which signed an agreement last year with Turkiye
Petrolleri for exploration in the Mediterranean, is also
interested in hydrocarbon exploration in the Black Sea, Voser
was quoted by the agency as saying.  Seismic work in the Mediterranean field, off Turkey’s
resort cost town of Antalya, has begun, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
