July as the region’s deepening economic slump eroded consumer
demand from Germany to Spain.  Sales slipped 0.2 percent from June, when they rose 0.1 
percent, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg 
said today. Economists had forecast a decline of 0.2 percent, 
according to the median of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg News 
survey. From a year earlier,  sales  dropped 1.7 percent.  In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, retail sales fell 0.9
percent from June, when they gained 0.5 percent, today’s report
showed. France reported a gain of 0.9 percent, while sales fell
1.9 percent in Spain.  The statistics office didn’t report data for  Greece , Cyprus
or Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
