U.S. stock futures trimmed declines
as European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s bond-buying
proposal was said to involve unlimited debt purchases to stem
the region’s crisis.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent to
1,405.30 at 8:09 a.m. New York time, after dropping as much as
0.6 percent earlier.  Draghi’s bond-buying proposal involves unlimited purchases
of government debt that will be sterilized to assuage concerns
about printing money, two central bank officials briefed on the
plan said. Under the blueprint, which may be called “Monetary
Outright Transactions,” the ECB would refrain from setting a
public cap on yields, according to the people familiar with the
plan, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
