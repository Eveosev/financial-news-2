Film actor and director  Clint Eastwood  shared the spotlight with Republican presidential
nominee Mitt Romney as highlights of the party’s nominating
convention, a poll shows.  Twenty percent of those surveyed said Eastwood -- who
delivered an improvisational and imaginary conversation with
President  Barack Obama , represented by an empty chair, on the
stage of the convention in Tampa, Florida -- was the gathering’s
high point, according to the poll conducted by Washington-based
Pew Research Center.  Just 17 percent said Romney, a former Massachusetts
governor and Bain Capital chief executive who accepted his
party’s nomination for president on stage following Eastwood’s
act, was the convention’s main attraction, the poll shows.  In a survey of 1,008 adults, conducted Aug. 31 through Sept.
3, those numbers represent a virtual tie. The margin of error
for the poll is plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. One in five
surveyed said the convention had no highlight.  The poll also reaffirmed what television viewership data
from  Nielsen Media Research  showed: viewership was down from the
Republican convention in 2008, when Senator  John McCain  of
Arizona was nominated.  “The public paid far less attention to this year’s
Republican convention” than it did four years ago,  Andrew Kohut ,
Pew Research Center president, said in a statement today. “Just
37 percent say they watched all or some of the Republican
convention, down from 56 percent in 2008.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
