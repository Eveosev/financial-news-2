VeriFone Systems Inc. (PAY)  tumbled after
the maker of credit-card terminals reported third-quarter sales
that fell short of analysts’ estimates, citing unfavorable
currency swings, competition in Europe and a fire in  Brazil .  The shares of  San Jose , California-based VeriFone dropped
14 percent to $30.55 at the close in  New York , the biggest
decline since May. The stock has fallen 14 percent this year.  Revenue in the quarter rose 54 percent from a year earlier
to $489.1 million, VeriFone said yesterday in a statement. That
missed the average $498.7 million estimate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One reason for the shortfall was a July
fire that destroyed the company’s Brazilian staging-and-repair
center, causing some VeriFone customers to turn to rivals.
VeriFone also faced competitive pressure in France and Germany.  “The revenue was a little low in the quarter, and guidance
for the next quarter and the next year was lower,” said  Gil Luria , an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., in an interview
yesterday.  Net income rose 43 percent to $37.7 million, or 34 cents a
share, from $26.3 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier. Profit
excluding some items was 75 cents a share, topping the average
70 cent estimate.  VeriFone forecast fourth-quarter earnings excluding certain
items of 75 cents to 77 cents a share. For the fiscal year
ending in October 2013, profit excluding some items will be
$3.25 a share to $3.30 a share. Sales in fiscal 2013 will be
$2.05 billion to $2.10 billion, less than the average $2.16
billion estimate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
