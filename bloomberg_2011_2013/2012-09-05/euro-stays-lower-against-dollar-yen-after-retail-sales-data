The euro stayed lower against the
dollar and the yen after a report showed European retail sales
dropped in July.  The 17-nation shared currency was 0.4 percent lower at
$1.2513 as of 10:09 a.m. London time, and fell 0.5 percent to
98.09 yen.  Sales slipped 0.2 percent from June, the European Unionâ€™s
statistics office in Luxembourg said today, in line with the
median estimates of 21 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
