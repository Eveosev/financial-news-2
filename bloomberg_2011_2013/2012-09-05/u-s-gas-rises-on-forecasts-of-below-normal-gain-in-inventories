Natural gas climbed for a fifth day
in  New York , the longest run of gains since July 24, on
speculation a government report this week will show a smaller-
than-normal increase in stockpiles.  Gas for October delivery rose as much as 1.5 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $2.869 per million British thermal units in
electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile exchange . It was
at $2.86 per million Btu at 10:27 a.m. Tokyo time.  Stockpiles probably rose 38 billion cubic feet in the week
ended Aug. 31, according to  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi
Futures Perspective in New York, before tomorrowâ€™s Energy
Department report. The five-year average change is a gain of 60
billion. A  surplus  of the fuel has been declining since March.  Futures rose 5.5 cents to settle at $2.854 per million
British thermal units yesterday in New York. Gas has climbed 9.4
percent from a two-month low of $2.614 on Aug. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
