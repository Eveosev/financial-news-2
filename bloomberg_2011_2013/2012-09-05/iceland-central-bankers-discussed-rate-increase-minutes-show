Members of the Iceland central
bank’s policy board discussed increasing the benchmark  interest
rate  by 25 basis points, according to minutes of the bank’s
August 20 and August 21 rate meetings, published today.  The Monetary Policy Committee “discussed leaving the
bank’s rates unchanged or raising them by 0.25 percentage
points,” the minutes showed. “The governor proposed that the
bank’s interest rates be kept unchanged.”  Four of the committee’s five members supported the no
change proposal, while one “voted against the governor’s
proposal and preferred that rates would be raised by 0.25
percentage points,” according to the minutes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
