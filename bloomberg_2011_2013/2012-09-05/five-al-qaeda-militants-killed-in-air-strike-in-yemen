Five al-Qaeda militants were killed
today in an air strike in the southeastern province of Hadramut,
 Yemen ’s  Defense Ministry  said on its website.  The attack came hours after President Abdurabuh Mansur Hadi
ordered an investigation into the killing of 15 civilians in an
air strike three days ago in the central province of al-Baodha,
the state-run Saba news agency reported late yesterday. The
strike mistakenly hit the civilians’ car while it was passing
near a vehicle occupied by al-Qaeda militants, Saba said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
