Michael Strahan’s debut alongside
Kelly Ripa on ABC’s syndicated TV program “Live With Kelly and
Michael” boosted the audience by 44 percent from a year ago.  Yesterday’s show with the former New York Giants football
player as co-host was the most-watched daytime program in 14 of
the top 15 television markets,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ABC said in a
e-mailed statement, citing preliminary Nielsen ratings.  ABC tapped Strahan as the permanent replacement for  Regis Philbin , who retired from the show in 2011. The program had
relied on guest hosts for the last nine months. Strahan, who
played with the Giants for 15 years culminating with a 2008
Super Bowl victory, will continue as an on-air commentator of
“Fox NFL Sunday.”  Produced by Disney’s WABC-TV in New York, the number of
viewers who watched the program in that market more than doubled
from September 2011, and was more than twice that of its nearest
competitor, NBC’s “Today” show, according to the statement.  Disney, based in Burbank,  California , climbed 2.3 percent
to $50.79 at the close in New York. The  stock  has gained 35
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
