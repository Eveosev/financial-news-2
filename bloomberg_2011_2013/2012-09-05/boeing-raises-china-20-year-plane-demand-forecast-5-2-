Boeing Co. (BA)  raised its 20-year  China 
commercial-aircraft market forecast by 5.2 percent, at least the
third straight increase, as economic growth and rising incomes
spur air travel in the world’s most populous nation.  Carriers in China will need 5,260 new planes worth $670
billion through 2031, according to a forecast the Chicago-based
planemaker released today in Beijing. The company last year
predicted the country would need 5,000 new planes with a value
of $600 billion through 2030.  Passenger numbers in China may rise 5 percent this year and
the next, Boeing said. The planemaker yesterday also raised its
India market forecast as Asian carriers expand their fleet to
meet rising leisure and business travel demand.  Airbus SAS (EAD)  has
said  emerging markets  will represent more than half of all
traffic growth in the next two decades.  “China is one of those markets where we’ve consistently
underestimated the growth,”  Randy Tinseth , Boeing’s vice
president for marketing, said. “Sustained strong economic
growth, growing trade activities and increasing personal wealth
are some of the driving forces.”  Boeing has won orders for 40 737s from Xiamen Airlines Co.,
10 777s from Xiamen Air’s parent  China Southern Airlines Co. (1055)  and
20 777s from China Eastern Airlines Corp. this year. Xiamen Air
is also in talks about ordering 30 737 MAX planes, an official
at the airline said last month.  Comac’s C919  Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China is also working on a new
narrow-body aircraft, the C919, which is scheduled to make its
first flight in 2014. Comac won an order for 45 C919 planes from
the leasing arm of  Agricultural Bank of China Ltd.  in June,
boosting its backlog to 280 planes from 12 buyers, the Shanghai-
based company said in June.  China will become the largest market by value of plane
deliveries in next two decades, Airbus said yesterday. About 69
percent of respondents surveyed in the country by the company
said they would fly more in the future, the Toulouse, France-
based planemaker said in  a statement .  “We expect Chinese carriers to experience rapid
international expansion over the next 20 years,” Tinseth said.
“Chinese carriers now have the capability and resources to
compete in the tough long-haul international market.”  Carriers in India will need 1,450 new aircraft worth $175
billion through 2031, according to Boeing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
