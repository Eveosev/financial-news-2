Bill Gross , who runs the world’s
biggest bond fund at Pacific Investment Management Co., said the
age of credit expansion which led to “double-digit” portfolio
returns is over.  Instead, investors face an “age of inflation, which
typically provides a headwind, not a tailwind, to securities
prices -- both stocks and bonds,” Gross said in his monthly
investment outlook posted on the Newport Beach, California-based
company’s  website  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
