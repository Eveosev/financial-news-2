The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities dropped for the second day, falling 0.6 percent
to 668.72 at 4:36 p.m. in  New York  as natural gas, coffee and
wheat futures declined. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw
materials slipped 0.2 percent to 1600.405.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures dropped in New York for the first time
in five days on forecasts of cooler weather that would limit
demand from  power plants .  Gas slid 2.1 percent as Commodity Weather Group LLC in
Bethesda,  Maryland , predicted mostly normal or below-normal
temperatures in the eastern and southern U.S. from Sept. 10 to
Sept. 14 after hot weather this week. Cooling demand in the U.S.
may be 12 percent lower than average from Sept. 11 to Sept. 15,
according to Weather Derivatives in Belton,  Missouri .  Natural gas for October delivery fell 5.9 cents to settle
at $2.795 per million British thermal units on the  New York

European natural gas: NI EGASMARKET  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Wheat futures tumbled to the lowest in almost three weeks
on speculation that demand will slow as livestock producers use
more corn, a cheaper substitute for  animal feed .  Corn prices have slumped 6.9 percent since touching a
record high on Aug. 10, cooling a rally sparked by crop damage
from the worst U.S. drought since 1956. Over the same period,
wheat dropped 3.7 percent.  Wheat futures for December delivery declined 2.4 percent to
settle at $8.6775 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after
reaching $8.6525, the lowest since Aug. 16. The contract posted
the biggest decline since Aug. 23, and prices have dropped in
nine of the past 10 sessions.  Corn futures for December delivery fell 1.8 percent today
on the CBOT to close at $7.9075 a bushel, compared with an all-
time high of $8.49 last month. Corn is the biggest U.S. crop
followed by soybeans, hay and wheat, government figures show.  Grain markets: NI GRMKTS  SOFT COMMODITIES  Cocoa rose the most in four months in New York on concern
that dry weather will dent crop prospects in West Africa, the
world’s largest producing region. Sugar and coffee fell.  Over the past two months, southern areas in  Ivory Coast  and
 Ghana  got about 20 percent to 40 percent of the usual
precipitation for this time of year, said Donald Keeney, a
senior agricultural meteorologist at MDA Information Systems
Inc. Futures rose for three straight months through August, the
longest rally since early 2011.  Cocoa for delivery in December climbed 4 percent to close
at $2,654 a metric ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New York, the
biggest gain for a most-active contract since May 1.  Raw-sugar futures for delivery in October dropped 1.7
percent to 19.01 cents a pound on ICE. Arabica-coffee futures
for delivery in December fell 2.8 percent to $1.606 a pound in
New York.  Orange juice  rose, capping the longest rally in almost a
year, on speculation that storms may threaten crops in  Florida ,
the world’s second-largest citrus grower. Cotton dropped.  Hurricane Leslie will move northward in the Atlantic from
 Bermuda  on a path to eastern  Canada , said Donald Keeney, a
senior agricultural meteorologist with MDA Information Systems
Inc. An area of low-pressure over southern  Alabama  and the
 Florida Panhandle  is expected to move into the north-central
 Gulf of Mexico  as early as today, the Miami-based National
Hurricane Center said.  Orange juice for November delivery climbed 2.9 percent to
settle at $1.247 a pound on ICE. That was the sixth straight
advance, the longest climb since Sept. 7, 2011.  Cotton futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
75.35 cents a pound on ICE, the second straight drop.  Soft  commodities markets : NI SOMKTS  CRUDE OIL  Oil was little changed in New York as European Central Bank
policy makers met to discuss the plan involving unlimited
purchases of government debt to ease the region’s debt crisis.  Futures were steady after two central bank officials said
Germany’s Bundesbank objected to the plan. Prices initially rose
0.4 percent on the proposal by ECB President Mario Draghi, who
will announce a decision at a press conference tomorrow.  Crude oil for October delivery rose 6 cents to settle at
$95.36 a barrel on the Nymex. Futures have retreated 3.5 percent
this year.  Oil markets: NI OILMARKET  OIL PRODUCTS  Heating oil fell as Gulf Coast refineries started up after
Hurricane Isaac last week knocked out 13 percent of the region’s
fuel-making capacity.  Futures sank to a one-week low on speculation that
production will increase, rebuilding supplies that dropped as
flooding, power losses and disruption of crude oil supplies shut
seven refineries and reduced output at four others. Valero
Energy Corp. said most production units are back online today at
its two Louisiana refineries.  Heating oil for October delivery fell 2.92 cents, or 0.9
percent, to settle at $3.1176 a gallon on the Nymex.  October-delivery gasoline declined 0.24 cent to settle at
$2.9498 a gallon on the exchange.  Gasoline: NI GASOLINE

Oil Products Europe: NI OPEMKT  BASE METALS  Copper rose to a six-week high on speculation that a
European Central Bank plan to buy bonds will help stem the
region’s debt crisis, improving prospects for metal demand.  A proposal from ECB President  Mario Draghi  involves
unlimited purchases of government debt that will be sterilized,
which ensures a neutral impact on the  money supply  by removing
funds from elsewhere in the banking system, two central bank
officials briefed on the plan said. Draghi will announce
tomorrow whether the plan has been adopted.  Copper futures for December delivery gained 1.7 percent to
settle at $3.529 a pound on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
price reached $3.534, the highest for a most-active contract
since July 19.  On the LME, copper for delivery in three months gained 1.3
percent to $7,735.50 a ton ($3.51 a pound). Aluminum, nickel,
tin, lead and zinc also rose.  Base metals markets: NI BMMKTS  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures declined for the first time in three sessions
as the  European Central Bank ’s plan to buy bonds lowered demand
for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation.  Yesterday, gold reached $1,701.60 an ounce, the highest
since March 13.  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.1 percent to

gain. Palladium futures for December delivery rose 0.9 percent
to $646.95 an ounce.  Precious metal markets: NI PCMKTS  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures fell for the first time in more than a week on
speculation that increasing supplies of pork in the U.S. are
outpacing demand. Cattle prices rose.  Meatpackers processed 447,000 hogs in the week ending Sept.
1 in Iowa and southern Minnesota, the nation’s largest producing
area, up 3 percent from a week earlier, government data show.
Yesterday, spot-market hogs declined to the cheapest since Dec.
28, 2010, and the price of wholesale pork fell to a 14-week low.  Hog futures for October settlement fell 0.8 percent to
