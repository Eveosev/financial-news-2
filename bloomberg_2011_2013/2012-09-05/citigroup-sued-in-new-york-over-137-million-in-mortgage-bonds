Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  and  UBS AG (UBSN)  were sued separately in New York over losses on
$368.7 million in mortgage-backed securities.  The three banks made “material misrepresentations” about
the loans backing the securities and about the transfer of the
loans into trusts, according to filings today in New York State
Supreme Court.  IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB)  sued Citigroup over losses on
$137.4 million in mortgage securities and also sued Goldman
Sachs over $73.2 million in securities. IKB, a German lender,
said it sold the securities at a loss.  UBS, based in Zurich, was sued by Sealink Funding Ltd. over
$158.1 million in bonds. The securities at issue in the UBS case
are either held by Sealink or were previously sold at a loss,
according to court papers.  Claims against Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and UBS include
fraud and negligent misrepresentation, according to the filings.  Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Citigroup;  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for New York-based
Goldman Sachs; and UBS spokeswoman Karina Byrne declined to
comment on the filings.  The cases are IKB International SA in Liquidation v.
Citigroup Inc., 653100-2012; IKB International SA in Liquidation
v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 653101-2012; and Sealink Funding
Ltd. v. UBS AG, 653102-2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
