Fotowatio Renewable Ventures , the
solar-power plant developer backed by U.S. energy investor
Denham Capital Management LP, won the right to build a 20-
megawatt project near  Australia ’s capital.  Fotowatio will participate in the Australian Capital
Territory’s feed-in tariff program, which rewards generators of
solar power by paying above-market prices for the electricity,
Simon Corbell, ACT minister for the environment and sustainable
development, said today in a statement.  The Royalla solar farm, to be built about 25 kilometers (16
miles) south of Canberra, will become the largest in Australia
by 2014, according to the statement. The venture will help in an
effort to lower  carbon emissions  and shift away from fossil
fuels, the ACT government said.  Fotowatio, which is based in the Netherlands, sought a new
project in Australia after losing a competition earlier this
year for federal government funds to build a large-scale solar
plant in New South Wales state. Denham Capital in March reached
an agreement with Fotowatio to invest $190 million in solar
projects in markets including Australia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
