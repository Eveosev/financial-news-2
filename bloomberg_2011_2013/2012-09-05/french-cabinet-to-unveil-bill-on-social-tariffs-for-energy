The French government will today
unveil a bill to put in place so-called social tariffs for
water, power and natural gas, Environment and Energy Minister
Delphine Batho’s office said.  The plan, which will be laid out at the weekly cabinet
meeting, would link rates to volumes used, with greater
consumption resulting in higher rates. Details of who will pay
the higher rates were not immediately available.  Batho is also set to discuss a planned revision of the
country’s mining code at today’s meeting, according to a
statement from the president’s press office.  The code defines rules on exploration and production of
minerals, oil and natural gas in  France  and applies to fracking
and other drilling techniques used to produce oil and natural
gas from shale rock.  To contact the reporters on this story:
