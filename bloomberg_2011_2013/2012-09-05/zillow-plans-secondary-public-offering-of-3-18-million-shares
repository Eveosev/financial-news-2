Zillow Inc. (Z) , a real-estate
information website, said it plans to sell 3.18 million shares
of its Class A common stock in a secondary public offering.  The company will use the proceeds of the sale for general
corporate purposes. Some of the proceeds may be used for
acquisitions or investments, though the company has no current
agreements or commitments, Seattle-based Zillow said today in a
statement.  Citigroup Inc. will be lead bookrunning manager of the
offering, with  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  as joint bookrunning
manager. An additional 325,000 shares will be sold by some
existing shareholders, according to the statement.  Zillow’s website allows home buyers, sellers, renters and
managers to list and search for properties, home-price estimates
and other information.  The company’s shares slipped 3.5 percent to $40.99 in
extended trading following the announcement. Earlier, they had
gained 2.3 percent to $42.43 at the close in  New York . The stock
has more than doubled since Zillow sold shares at $20 apiece in
an initial public offering in July 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
