Gunmen set off an explosion last
night that damaged Yemen’s main crude oil pipeline in Marib,
 Agence France-Presse  said, citing Abdel Qawi al-Odaini,
information director at the oil ministry.  The blast shut the flow of oil, AFP reported.  Crude began flowing into the 420-kilometer (260-mile)
pipeline from  oil fields  in Marib on July 15 after repairs from
earlier attacks were completed. Crude from Marib has been cut
off from refineries and markets as a result of at least 18
attacks on the pipeline since March 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
