The Dubai Mercantile Exchange,
majority-owned by  CME Group Inc. (CME) , added  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) 
of India as its newest member.  “Reliance is understood to be the first major Indian
enterprise to participate directly in a global oil futures
market,” the exchange, or DME, said today in a statement.  The refiner joins  Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  and Vitol
Group as members of the exchange, which plans to expand its Oman
crude futures contract in Asia. The DME appointed Christopher
Fix, former head of marketing for commodity futures in Asia
Pacific at BNP Paribas SA, as chief executive officer in June.  Reliance operates the world’s largest refining complex at
Jamnagar in the western state of Gujarat.  To contact the reporter on this story:
