(Corrects first paragraph of story published yesterday to
show Sberbank is buying a stake in BNP Paribas’s  Russia  consumer
finance unit.)  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank,
acquired 70 percent of  BNP Paribas SA’s (BNP)  consumer finance unit in
Russia.  The new entity will use the French bank’s  Cetelem  brand and
the remaining 30 percent will be retained by Paris-based BNP
Paribas, Sberbank said in an e-mailed statement today. Sberbank
paid 5.1 billion rubles ($157 million), Interfax reported today,
citing Senior Vice President Denis Bugrov.  The operation will be led by Andrey Lykov, former adviser
to president and chairman of the board of Sberbank, the company
said.  Sberbank’s deals this year include  Turkey ’s Denizbank,
acquired in June for $3.5 billion, and most of  Oesterreichische
Volksbanken AG (VBPS) ’s eastern European business for 505 million euros
($633 million) in February. The latter deal was as a platform to
expand in the region following its $1 billion acquisition in
January of Moscow brokerage Troika Dialog.  Setting up the bank with Cetelem is the best way to enter
the “point-of-sale finance market” where Sberbank isn’t
active, Bugrov said in the statement. Cetelem has a 4.5 percent
share of the Russian market, Bugrov said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
