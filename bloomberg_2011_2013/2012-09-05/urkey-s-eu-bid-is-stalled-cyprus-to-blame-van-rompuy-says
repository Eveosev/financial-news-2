Turkey ’s bid to join the European
Union is “stalled” and Cyprus is to blame, EU President  Herman Van Rompuy  said.  Cyprus, its northern part occupied by the Turkish army, has
used its veto power as an EU member to freeze Turkey’s entry
talks since mid-2010. The Cypriot government now holds the EU’s
six-month rotating presidency, making progress before 2013
unlikely.  “Were it not for some challenges from one of the members
of the European Union, Cyprus, we would have made more progress
when it comes to Turkey,” Van Rompuy told a Brussels conference
today. “I acknowledge that negotiations on enlargement are
stalled for the time being because one of the members of the
club has problems with the process.”  Since opening the entry negotiations in 2005, Turkey has
completed talks in only one of 35 EU policy areas. Its failure
to advance contrasts with  Croatia , which started the process at
the same time and is scheduled to join the bloc in July 2013.  “Intensive discussions are ongoing and I hope to visit
Turkey to get that message across,”  Van Rompuy  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
