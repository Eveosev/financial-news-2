Duet Group (DUE)  hired Philippe Laraison
from  Societe Generale  SA as chief investment officer for its
Duet Commodities Fund.  He replaces Tony Hall, who resigned in July after the fund
lost money in nine out of 10 months. The Duet Commodities Fund
lost 6.4 percent this year through June, after gaining 26
percent in 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Laraison “is very experienced and established in the
commodity space,” Henry Gabay, company co-founder, said in a
telephone interview from  London . “Philippe will likely begin
trading within the next 30 days. Another hiring will be
announced on the metals side very shortly.”  Laraison, who joined Societe Generale in 1994, worked as
the bank’s head of energy trading in  New York  from 2007 to 2011,
the company said in an e-mailed statement. He was global head of
refined oil trading at the bank from 2001 to 2004.  The Duet fund trades commodities from oil to metals after
starting in July 2010.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials has
gained 4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Grant Smith in London at
