Peru’s fiscal revenue probably will
rise 11 billion soles ($4.21 billion) next year as the economy
expands, El Peruano  reported , citing Finance Minister Miguel Castilla.  The increase will help cover planned pay raises for
teachers, the police and armed forces, Castilla told Congress
yesterday, according to the state-owned newspaper. The nation’s
gross domestic product is projected to grow 33 billion soles
next year, El Peruano said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
