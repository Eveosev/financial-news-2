Romania ’s currency gained for the
first time in four days, reversing an earlier decline, after a
Constitutional Court ruling allowed President Traian Basescu to
return to office.  The leu appreciated as much as 0.5 percent and traded 0.3
percent stronger at 4.4816 per euro by 7:09 p.m. in Bucharest,
the highest since Aug. 15. It lost as much as 0.2 percent in
earlier trading before the court’s decision today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on Romania’s dollar-
denominated bond maturing in 2022 fell 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.68 percent, the lowest since the bonds
were sold Jan. 31.  Judges voted six to three to invalidate a July 29
presidential impeachment vote as less than 50 percent of the
eligible voters participated in the referendum, the Bucharest-
based court said today. The power struggle between Basescu and
Prime Minister Victor Ponta  has weakened the leu and increased
the country’s borrowing costs.  “Return to office raises concerns of a continuation of
disagreements between him and the government,” analysts
including Irina Cretu at the National  Bank of Greece (TELL)  Securities
Romania SA said in an e-mail after the ruling.  The leu has declined 0.3 percent in the past three days,
extending its three-month retreat to 1.2 percent, the worst
performer among emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Romania’s  Finance Ministry  rejected all bids at an auction
yesterday because of “unacceptable yield offers,” the central
bank, which organizes the auction, said. The administration had
planned to sell 500 million lei ($137 million) in one-year
treasury bills. Demand totaled 864 million lei for the bills,
the bank said on its website.  Yields on one-year treasuries rose to 5.66 percent on Aug.
6 from 5.29 percent on June 11, according to central bank data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
