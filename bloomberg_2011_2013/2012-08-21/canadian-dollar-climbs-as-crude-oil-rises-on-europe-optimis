Canada’s dollar weakened from an
almost four-month high versus its U.S. counterpart after a
decline in equities increased investor  risk aversion , prompting
investors to sell higher-returning currencies.  The dollar had appreciated to the highest level since May 3
as oil gained and stocks rose amid speculation Europe’s debt
crisis won’t worsen. The loonie has a 30-day correlation
coefficient of 0.81 with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. A
reading of 1 would indicate they move in lockstep. The
correlation with crude oil is 0.63.  “We are seeing a very strong correlation between stocks
and the Canadian dollar right now,” said  Jack Spitz , managing
director of foreign exchange at  National Bank of Canada (NA)  in
Toronto, said in a telephone interview. “Risk assets are coming
off some, but the fundamental story for Canada still argues for
stronger performance given an improving global environment.”  Canada’s currency, nicknamed the loonie, declined 0.08
percent to 98.92 cents per  U.S. dollar  at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It
touched 98.43 cents, the strongest since May 3. One Canadian
dollar buys $1.0109.  The S&P 500 dropped 0.4 percent after earlier trading above
a four-year closing high of 1,419.04 reached on April 2.  Implied volatility for one-month options on the U.S. dollar
versus the Canadian currency remained close to the lowest level
since May 2007 at 6.3 percent. The five-year average is 12
percent. Implied volatility, which traders quote and use to set
option prices, signals the expected pace of currency swings.  Government bonds were steady, with the yield on 10-year
bond little changed at 1.93 percent. The price of the 2.75
percent securities maturing in June 2022 increased 8 cents to
C$107.31.  Statistics Canada  said today that wholesale sales fell 0.1
percent in June, after rising 0.9 percent in May. The median
forecast of 15 respondents in a Bloomberg News survey called for
sales to rise 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
