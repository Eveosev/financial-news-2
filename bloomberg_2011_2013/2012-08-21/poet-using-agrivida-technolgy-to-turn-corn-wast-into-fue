Poet LLC, the largest U.S. producer
of corn-based ethanol, will use technology from Agrivida Inc. to
develop processes to turn crop waste into biofuel.  Poet, based in  Sioux Falls ,  South Dakota , is seeking to
implement Agrivida’s systems for processing corn stover, the
stalks and leaves that remain after the crop is harvested, in
its existing cellulosic ethanol process, according to a
statement today.  Poet has operated a cellulosic ethanol pilot plant since
2008 and its first commercial facility is expected to begin
production next year in  Iowa . The Agrivida technology may reduce
the cost of converting plants into fuel, Wade Robey, chief
technology officer for closely held Poet, said in the statement.  “If successful, Agrivida’s novel approach to increase the
functionality and value delivery of corn stover will work well
with other technologies being developed by Poet,” he said.  Agrivida is developing seeds that make plants easier to
break down than traditional crops and systems to convert them
into fermentable sugars, according to the company’s website.  Poet’s cellulosic technology may be used to produce as much
as 1 billion gallons (3.8 billion liters) of ethanol a year if
deployed at all of its 27 corn-based biofuel plants, according
to the statement.  An estimated 160 million to 250 million dry tons of corn
stover is available each year for processing, Medford,
Massachusetts-based Agrivida said. That’s enough to produce as
much as 25 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuels or chemicals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
