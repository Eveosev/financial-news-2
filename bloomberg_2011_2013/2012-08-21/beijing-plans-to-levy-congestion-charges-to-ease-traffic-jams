Beijing plans to build a system for
imposing road-congestion charges on motorists, adding to caps on
vehicle registrations as  China ’s capital seeks to ease traffic
jams and cut emissions.  The municipal government will also accelerate the expansion
of the subway network, increase dedicated bus lanes and
encourage the use of bicycles for short commutes, according to a
five-year development plan by the city’s transportation
commission posted on its  website .  “Beijing faces a serious test in the next five years with
the rapid growth in population and number of vehicles,” the
commission said in its plan, which covers the period from 2011
to 2015. The document didn’t include details on the congestion
charges or when they will be imposed.  If the plan goes ahead, Beijing will join London and
 Singapore  among cities that levy congestion fees to deter usage.
China’s capital already caps the number of new vehicle
registrations and limits the use of private vehicles on
designated days based on their license plate numbers.  The city will also restrict growth in the number of
official cars and targets to reduce vehicular emissions by 10
percent from 2010 levels, according to the plan.  Traffic jams eased to an average 55 minutes during weekdays
in the first quarter, compared with 75 minutes a year earlier,
the Beijing Transportation Research Center said in June. In
2010, commuters spent an average 2 hours and 25 minutes a day in
gridlock.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
