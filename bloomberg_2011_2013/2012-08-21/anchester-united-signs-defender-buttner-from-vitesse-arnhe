Manchester United signed defender
Alexander Buttner from Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem, the Premier
League team said on its website.  Buttner signed a five-year contract until 2017, United
said, without disclosing financial terms. The 23-year-old made
119 appearances for Vitesse over the past four years.  Buttner is the second Dutchman to join United in the past
week after striker  Robin van Persie  signed from Arsenal on Aug.
17.  United opened its season last night with a 1-0 loss at
Everton. The Red Devils host Fulham on Aug. 25 at Old Trafford.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
