Cameroon will “keep watch on the
diamond trade” after its admission into the  Kimberley Process 
to certify the gems, Emmanuel Bonde, minister of mines,
industries and technological development, said.  Cameroon is now officially a member of the joint
government, industry and civil-society intitiative, which tries
to stem the flow of so-called conflict diamonds, he told
reporters in Yaounde, the capital, today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
