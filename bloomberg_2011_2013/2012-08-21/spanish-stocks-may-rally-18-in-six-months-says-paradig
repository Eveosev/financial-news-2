Spanish stocks may advance as much
as 18 percent in the next four to six months after breaking
through a key level, according to an analyst at Paradigm Capital
Inc.  The country’s benchmark gauge has rallied above the 7,200
level, confirming a double-bottom reversal pattern that signals
that a rally has begun, Paradigm’s Tina Normann wrote in a note
today.  The  IBEX 35 Index (IBEX)  has rallied 26 percent since its 2012 low
on July 24 amid better-than-expected company revenues,
speculation policy makers will do more to stimulate the global
economy and European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi ’s
pledge to preserve the euro.  The reversal pattern is also backed by momentum, Normann
said. The moving average convergence/divergence indicator, or
MACD, on the IBEX 35 shows a buy signal, Normann wrote. This
resurgence in momentum strength means that the gauge may break
out above the 18-month downtrend near 7,600, supporting an
increase toward 8,800, Normann wrote.  The IBEX 35 dropped 1.2 percent to 7469.6 in  Madrid 
yesterday as  Germany ’s Bundesbank criticized an ECB plan to
lower the sovereign yields of the euro area’s most-indebted
nations through bond purchases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
