Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  led Czech shares
higher as investors awaited data that may show the U.S. economy
is improving and amid optimism European policy makers will act
to resolve the region’s debt crisis.  Erste of Austria added 2.7 percent to 408.7 koruna in
Prague.  Komercni Banka As (KOMB) , the Czech unit of Societe Generale
SA, advanced 2.1 percent to 3,850 koruna. The PX equity index,
in which the two lenders have a 39 percent weighting, rose 1.2
percent to 950.50 at the close, rebounding from yesterday’s 1
percent slide.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , head of the
group of euro-area finance ministers, visits Athens tomorrow to
hear Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s request for a two-
year extension to the country’s fiscal-adjustment program.
French President  Francois Hollande  and German Chancellor Angela Merkel meet in Berlin on Aug. 23. U.S. home sales and durable
goods orders probably increased in July, economists said before
reports this week.  “Optimism regarding the U.S. data and expectations that
there will be a shift in European debt crisis after the meetings
are boosting the market,” Jiri Simara, an analyst with Cyrrus
AS in Prague, said by phone today. “Financial stocks are most
sensitive to that and there is also a correction of yesterday’s
losses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
