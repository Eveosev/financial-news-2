Los Angeles  should consider raising
taxes on real-estate sales to deal with continuing budget
deficits, the city administrative officer said.  The second-largest U.S. city by population has whittled the
deficit to a projected $238 million in the current fiscal year,
from $529 million in the year that ended in June 2010,  Chief
Administrative Officer  Miguel Santana  said today in a report.
Further reductions aren’t likely without additional revenue
because of a projected 4.2 percent annual increase in costs such
as salaries, pensions, health care, and workers’ compensation,
he said.  The city, with a budget of $7.2 billion for fiscal 2013,
has faced deficits totaling $1.6 billion over the past four
years and is considering turning over its zoo and convention
center to private management to save money.  “In order to fund the cost of services demanded by city
residents, voters should be given the opportunity to support
them with increased taxes,” Santana said in the report.  In addition to raising the tax on property sales, currently
$4.50 per $1,000 in value, Santana said the city should consider
increasing the tax on parking lots, currently 10 percent of
revenue.  His report also recommended reviewing taxes on sales,
entertainment tickets, utilities, hotels, gross receipts and
petroleum extraction.  The City Council will need to decide by Oct. 31 which
options to present to voters in the next municipal election,
scheduled for March 5, the report said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
