Germany  will still have to rely on
fossil fuel in 2050 to ensure power supplies, even if it plans
to switch to greener energy,  Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung
 reported citing a study by Deutsche Energie-Agentur GmbH.  The research, which was paid for by  RWE AG (RWE) , found that coal
and gas power plants will have to provide 60 percent of the
“ensured generation,” of  energy supply  available in periods
when there’s no wind or sunlight at hand for power generation,
the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
