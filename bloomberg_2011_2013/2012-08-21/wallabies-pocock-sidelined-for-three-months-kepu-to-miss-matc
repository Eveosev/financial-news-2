Australia captain  David Pocock  will
miss the remainder of the Rugby Championship following surgery
on the knee he injured in the tournament opener.  The openside flanker underwent a keyhole procedure today
after damaging the articular cartilage of his right knee during
the Wallabies’ 27-19 loss to  New Zealand  in Sydney three days
ago. The recommended three-month rehabilitation also puts
Pocock, 24, in doubt for Australia’s tour of the northern
hemisphere later this year, the team said in a statement.   Scrum-half Will Genia will lead Australia against the All
Blacks in the second round of southern hemisphere rugby’s annual
championship in Auckland on Aug. 25. Prop Sekope Kepu was ruled
out of the match at Eden Park after straining a knee ligament
during a training session in Sydney today, the team said in a
later statement. The squad will be named in two days before it
flies out to New Zealand.  Pocock was appointed Australia captain in June after
regular skipper  James Horwill  ruptured his hamstring, an injury
that needed surgery and sidelined the second-rower for the rest
of the year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
