Barra Energia Petroleo e Gas, an oil
startup with a 10 percent stake in  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) ’s
Carcara oil discovery, sees potential to find similar fields at
the same concession in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean.  “One of the most important consequences of this discovery
is that we have other geologically similar prospects nearby
Carcara inside our BM-S-8 block, which now have been greatly de-
risked and add enormous value to this block,” Barra Chief
Executive Officer  Renato Bertani  said in an e-mailed response to
questions.  Petrobras, based in Rio de Janeiro, is still drilling to
find the bottom of the reservoir, Bertani said. The first well
at Carcara encountered a layer of good-quality oil more than 400
meters (1,312 feet) thick, compared with as much as 350 meters
at Lula,  Brazil ’s largest field with an estimated 6.5 billion
barrels of reserves, Jose Formigli, the head of Petrobras’s
exploration and production unit, told reporters Aug. 15.  Petrobras and its partners need to drill additional wells
to determine the size of Carcara, Formigli said at the time.
Brazil expects to more than double oil production by 2020 as
Petrobras develops the largest discoveries in the America’s
since  Mexico  found Cantarell in 1976.  The state-controlled company operates the BM-S-8 concession
with a 66 percent stake.  Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP)  has a 14 percent
stake and  QGEP Participacoes SA (QGEP3)  has a 10 percent stake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
