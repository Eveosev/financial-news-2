The following is the text
of  Canada â€™s wholesale trade report for June from
 Statistics Canada .  Wholesale sales edged down 0.1% to $49.9 billion in June,
after four consecutive monthly increases. In volume terms,
wholesale sales were down 0.5%.  A decline in the miscellaneous subsector was almost
entirely offset by increases in five of the seven subsectors.  Sales of the miscellaneous subsector were down 6.4% in June.
Although four of the five industries in the subsector posted
declines, the agricultural supplies industry (-20.5%) was by far
the largest contributor to the change.  Excluding the miscellaneous subsector, wholesale sales rose
0.9%.  The largest advance in dollar terms was in the motor
vehicle and parts subsector (+2.2%). This fifth consecutive
increase was attributable to higher sales in the motor vehicle
industry (+3.4%).  Sales in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector
rose by 1.3% in June, a third consecutive gain. Overall, three
of the four industries in the subsector reported higher sales.  The food, beverage and tobacco subsector continued the
upward trend that began at the end of 2009. Sales were up 0.3%
in June, following a 1.3% advance in May.  Lower sales in most provinces  Wholesalers in seven provinces reported lower sales in June.
These declines were largely offset by higher sales in Ontario.  Ontario, which accounts for roughly 50% of total wholesale
sales, reported sales growth of 1.2% in June, the fifth increase
since the beginning of 2012. The June advance was mainly a
result of higher sales in the motor vehicle industry.  In  Quebec , wholesale sales were down 0.2%, the first
decrease in five months.  In Western Canada, sales declined in  Alberta  (-3.0%),
Saskatchewan (-2.0%) and Manitoba (-1.3%). Wholesale sales in
British Columbia were unchanged.  In June, three of the four Atlantic provinces posted
declines. Prince  Edward Island  (+9.1%) was the lone Atlantic
province to post a sales increase in June, following decreases
in the previous four months.  Increase in inventories  Inventories rose 0.4% to $60.2 billion in June. Inventories
were up in 16 of the 25 industries.  The largest inventory increases in dollar terms were in the
construction, forestry, mining and industrial machinery,
equipment and supplies industry (+2.3%) and the other
miscellaneous industry (+2.6%).  The inventory-to-sales ratio rose from 1.20 in May to 1.21
in June.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time in
months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain
at their current level.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
current dollars, unless otherwise noted. For more information on
seasonal adjustment, see Seasonal adjustment and identifying
economic trends ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010 -
x/2010003/part-partie3-eng.htm) .  Wholesale sales expressed in volume are calculated by
deflating current dollar values using import and industry
product price indexes. Since many of the goods sold by
wholesalers are imported, fluctuations in the value of the
Canadian dollar can have an important influence on the prices of
goods bought and sold by wholesalers.  The wholesale sales series in chained (2002) dollars is a
chained Fisher volume index with 2002 as the reference year.  Starting with the next release, total wholesale sales
published in volume, including the chain Fisher volume index,
will be revised from January 2004 onward to reflect
methodological enhancements. In addition, the reference year
will change from 2002 to 2007 for these volume data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
