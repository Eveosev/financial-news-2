German  government bonds  fell for a
second day, pushing the nation’s two-year rate above zero for
the first time in more than five weeks, on optimism a solution
can be found to  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Portugal’s  10-year yield  declined to a 15-month low and
Ireland’s nine-year bond yield dropped below 6 percent for the
first time since October 2010 amid speculation European leaders
will make progress on supporting  Greece  at meetings this week.
 Spain ’s  two-year notes  rose for a sixth day after borrowing
costs dropped at a bill sale. Securities issued by so-called
peripheral nations also rose on speculation the  European Central
Bank  will buy them to help contain the financial turmoil.  “It’s looking increasingly likely that the ECB is
undertaking serious discussions about a large-scale bond-
purchase program,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income
strategist at Rabobank International in  London . “If you see
such a program as a major step toward fiscal union and an
implicit transfer of liabilities from periphery to core, then
you would expect to see a selloff in bunds.”  Germany ’s two-year note yield climbed three basis points,
or 0.03 percentage point, to 0.008 percent at 4:33 p.m. London
time, above zero for the first time since July 12. It touched
0.017 percent, the highest since July 6. The zero percent bond
due June 2014 dropped 0.05, or 50 euro cents per 1,000-euro
($1,247) face amount, to 99.99. The nation’s 10-year yield
climbed five basis points to 1.55 percent.  Greek Meetings  Germany plans to sell as much as 5 billion euros of two-
year zero percent notes at an auction tomorrow.  Spain’s  10-year yield  fell seven basis points to 6.21
percent after declining to 6.16 percent yesterday, the lowest
since July 2. The two-year rate slid 10 basis points to 3.48
percent.  Italy ’s  10-year bond yield  slipped 12 basis points to
5.65 percent.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , the head of
the euro group of finance ministers, is due to visit Greece
tomorrow, while German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French
President  Francois Hollande  are scheduled to meet in Berlin on
Aug. 23 and both are set to talk separately with Samaras later
in the week.  Concessions from Greece’s international creditors are
possible so long as Prime Minister Antonis Samaras shows a
willingness to meet the main targets set out in his country’s
bailout program, a senior lawmaker with Merkel’s party said.  Spain sold its full allocation of 4.5 billion euros of 12-
and 18-month bills at today’s auction, with yields averaging
3.07 percent on the one-year debt, down from 3.918 percent at
the previous sale on July 17.  Euro ‘Fears’  The nation’s  two-year yield  has fallen from a euro-era high
of 7.15 percent set on July 25 amid speculation policy makers
will increase efforts to rein in borrowing costs. ECB President
 Mario Draghi  said on Aug. 2 the central bank may buy debt
together with the region’s bailout funds to address rates that
are elevated on “fears of the reversibility of the euro.”  Germany’s Spiegel magazine reported on Aug. 19 that the ECB
may seek to impose a ceiling on the borrowing costs of the euro-
zone’s most heavily indebted economies.  The euro strengthened 1 percent to $1.2473, and the Stoxx
Europe 600  Index (SXXP)  of shares gained 0.4 percent.  Portugal’s  10-year bond  yield dropped 35 basis points to
9.25 percent, the lowest since May 20, 2011.  The yield today dropped below the closing level of 9.58
percent on May 3, 2011, the day the nation reached an agreement
for a 78 billion-euro rescue plan from the European Union.  ‘Gaining Traction’  “The improvement in sentiment has been driven primarily by
reports of the ECB yield targeting gaining traction,” said
 Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec Bank Plc in London.
“Excluding Greece, Portuguese yields are the highest amongst
the peripherals, so naturally have the greatest scope to
outperform.”  Irish  nine-year yields  dropped eight basis points to 5.96
percent, the lowest level since October 2010.  Volatility on Dutch government debt was the highest in
euro-region markets today, followed by Italy, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two-and 10-year
securities, and credit-default swaps.  German debt returned 2.9 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
securities fell 1.9 percent, and Italy’s rose 11 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
