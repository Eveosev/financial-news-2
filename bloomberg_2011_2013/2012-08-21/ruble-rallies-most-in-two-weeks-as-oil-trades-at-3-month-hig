The ruble appreciated the most in
more than two weeks against the dollar as oil, the nation’s
chief export earner, traded at a three-month high.  The Russian currency strengthened 1.1 percent versus the
dollar to 31.7159 by the close in Moscow, the most since Aug. 6.
The ruble was unchanged against the euro at 39.57 and gained 0.6
percent against the central bank’s currency basket, which is 55
percent dollars and 45 percent euros, to 35.2502.  Crude for September delivery rose as much as 1.7 percent to
$97.60 in  New York  trading, the highest since May 7.  Brent crude 
added 1.4 percent to $115.23 a barrel.  “The ruble strengthens on higher  oil prices ,” said Maxim Korovin, a Moscow-based analyst at VTB Capital. “Russian
exporters are exchanging their dollars into rubles to pay taxes
at the end of the month, which supports the ruble.”  Investors pared bets on the ruble weakening against the
dollar, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
32.2093 in three months versus 32.57 on Aug. 20.  “The oil rally is speculative and not justified by
fundamental demand and supply balance, and the Eurozone crisis
hasn’t vanished,” Sergey Fishgoyt, deputy head of foreign
exchange at Otkritie Financial Corp., said by telephone.
“Therefore, the ruble may drop significantly within a month.”  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell nine basis points to 210,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. Yields on
the government’s ruble bonds due April 2021 fell to 7.83
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
