Romania’s benchmark stock index
rallied to the highest level in more than three months after a
Constitutional Court ruling invalidated an impeachment vote
against President Traian Basescu.  The  Bucharest Exchange Trading Index (BET)  climbed 0.4 percent to
close at 4,864.05, the highest since May 11, after earlier
retreating as much as 0.5 percent. Gains were led by  Fondul
Proprietatea SA (FP)  and  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , which both added 0.8 percent.  Six of nine judges voted to invalidate a July 29
presidential impeachment vote as less than half of the eligible
voters participated in the referendum, the Bucharest-based court
said today.  The ruling, once published in the official journal, allows
Basescu to return to his office and may prolong a feud between
him and Prime Minister Victor Ponta, who said today that Basescu
will be an “illegitimate president.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
