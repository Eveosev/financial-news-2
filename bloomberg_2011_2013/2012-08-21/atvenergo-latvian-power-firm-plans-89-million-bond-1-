AS Latvenergo,  Latvia ’s state-owned
electricity provider, plans to sell as much as 50 million lati
($89 million) in debt this year to spend on infrastructure.  The company plans to sell bonds in lati or euros, or both,
by the end of the year and has hired  SEB AB (SEBA)  to organize the
sale, Latvenergo said in a  statement  on its website. The state-
owned company will publish financial reports on a quarterly
basis, instead of annually, after the bonds are sold, according
to the statement.  The Latvian company’s bond sale would be the biggest public
corporate bond issue since the Baltic country regained
independence in 1991, said Natalja Tocelovska, head of
brokerage, fixed income and equity trading and  capital markets 
at SEB’s Latvian unit, in an e-mail.  “Latvenergo will practically be the first non-financial
company which will raise funds in the corporate  bond market ,”
said Tocelovska in the e-mail. “Estonia’s energy businesses,
which at the moment have issued bonds worth 575 million lati,
have had a very successful experience,” she said, citing bonds
sold by Eesti Eergia AS and Elering AS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
