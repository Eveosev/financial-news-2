China’s economy  will expand by more
than 8 percent this year as  growth  rebounds from a six-quarter
slowdown, said  Li Daokui , a former central bank adviser.  Full-year expansion will be 8.1 percent and fourth-quarter
growth may exceed 8.5 percent, Li, who was an academic member of
the People’s Bank of China monetary policy committee until March,
said in an interview today before speaking to a forum in Beijing.  Li’s comments compare with data this month showing China’s
slowdown at risk of extending into a seventh quarter, after
export growth slowed in July and industrial production and
lending missed economists’ forecasts. Li said China should
loosen policies further, including lowering the reserve-
requirement  ratio  for banks.  “A big problem at present is the weak investment from the
corporate sector, and China has to do more to encourage
corporate investment,” said Li, a professor at  Tsinghua
University  in Beijing.  --Zhou Xin. Editors: Scott Lanman, Patrick Harrington  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
