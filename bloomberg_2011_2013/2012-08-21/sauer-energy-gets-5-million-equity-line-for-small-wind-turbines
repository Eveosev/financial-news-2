Sauer Energy Inc. (SENY) , a maker of small-
scale vertical-axis wind turbines, rose the most in more than
two years after it signed a $5 million equity-line financing
agreement with  St. George  Investments LLC.  Sauer climbed 51 percent to 23 cents at the close in New
York, the biggest jump  since  July 23, 2010. That reduced the
loss this year to 68 percent.  Sauer Energy will use the funding from St. George to
produce its WindCharger wind turbines, the Newbury Park,
California-based company said today in a statement.  The equity line from Chicago-based St. George will also be
used to make turbines at  Helix Wind Corp. (HLXW) , which Sauer bought in
May, according to the statement. The financing is on a 36-month
term and provides a 6 percent discount to market prices.
Additional financial terms weren’t disclosed.  “Having this equity mechanism available to us, we are
aiming to maintain a debt-free balance sheet,” Chief Executive
Officer Dieter Sauer said in the statement.  Sauer Energy’s so-called microwind turbines are smaller
than the utility-scale turbines made by Vestas Wind Systems A/S
and General Electric Co. and can be used to reduce grid power
use at homes and businesses or for off-grid applications.  To contact the reporter on this story:
