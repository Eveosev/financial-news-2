European banks’ reluctance to lend
to one another held at the lowest level in more than a year,
according to a money-market indicator.  The  Euribor-OIS spread , the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, was little
changed at 24.9 basis points at 10:44 a.m. in London, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure is the lowest since
July 8, 2011.  Three-month Euribor, the rate banks say they see each other
lending in euros, was set at a record low 0.318 percent from
0.325 yesterday. The benchmark, derived from a daily survey of
banks for the European Banking Federation, fell for the twelfth
day.  The cost for banks to convert euro interest payments into
dollars dropped to the lowest since July 22, 2011. The three-
month cross-currency  basis swap  was 32.5 basis points below
Euribor from minus 35 yesterday.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 38 basis
points less than Euribor. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point.  An estimate of future average overnight borrowing costs in
euros, the three-month Eonia swap, was 7 basis points from 7.5
yesterday. The EBF’s euro overnight indexed average, or Eonia,
of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.109 percent yesterday
from 0.112 percent on Aug. 17.  Lenders increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
European Central Bank yesterday, placing 333 billion euros ($412
billion) with the bank from 327 billion euros on Aug. 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
