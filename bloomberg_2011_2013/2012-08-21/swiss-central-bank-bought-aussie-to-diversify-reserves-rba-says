The  Swiss National Bank  bought
Australian dollars as the central bank diversified its euro
holdings, according to  minutes  of the  Reserve Bank  of
Australia’s Aug. 7 meeting published today.  The Swiss central bank bought around 100 billion euros (120
billion francs) in May and June, with further buying likely in
July, to maintain its 1.20 franc peg against the European common
currency, the RBA said. A “modest amount” of the euros were
converted into the so-called Aussie dollar, the minutes said.  “When they’re buying the euros they have to recycle them
into fixed quantities, some of which into Aussie dollar,” said
 Chris Walker , a currency strategist at UBS AG in London. “It’s
only a small component of their reserve base but still net leads
to some euro-Aussie downside, or Aussie buying.”  The SNB introduced the franc cap in Sept. 6 after the euro
area’s fiscal crisis prompted investors to pile into the
currency, pushing it to near parity with the euro.  The Swiss central bank’s foreign-currency reserves swelled
11.3 percent in July to 406.5 billion Swiss francs, it said Aug.
7. Walter Meier, an SNB spokesman in Zurich, said then that “a
large part” of the increase resulted from currency purchases to
defend the minimum  exchange rate .  The Australian dollar has strengthened 6.8 percent against
the euro since the start of May. It traded little changed at
1.1826 per euro at 1:10 p.m.  London  time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
