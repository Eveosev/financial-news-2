(Corrects to say percentage points in second and fourth
paragraphs.)  The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index may
outperform the MSCI World Index in the year after  London  hosted
the Olympics as increased publicity attracts investor attention
to the market, according to Saxo Bank A/S.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows that the total return on the
benchmark indexes of the U.S.,  Australia ,  Greece  and  China ,
hosts of the four past summer Olympics, beat the MSCI World by
at least 14 percentage points.  “The outperformance has to do with the publicity the
Olympics generate for the country and the city, which then
serves as publicity much like for a regular company and may
cause investors to be more inclined to invest in the country’s
stocks,” Mathieu Bolduc, an equity analyst at Saxo Bank in
Copenhagen, said in a telephone interview on Aug. 14. “From a
historical perspective the odds are very good for the FTSE 100
to outperform after the London 2012 games.”  The  Standard & Poor’s 500  Index’s total relative return
exceeded the MSCI World Index’s by 24 percentage points 381 days
after the first day of the Atlanta Olympics in 1996. The
relative return for Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index was 27
percentage points more after the 2000 games in Sydney, while
that for Greece’s ASE Index was 28 percentage points more after
 Athens  hosted in 2004. The Hang Seng Index’s return was 15
percentage points more than the world index over the same number
of days after the 2008 games in Beijing.  The FTSE 100 has rallied 3.2 percent since the start of the
Olympics on July 27, compared with the MSCI’s 2.9 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
