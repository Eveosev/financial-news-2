OC Oerlikon Corp. AG (OERL)  said a
warehouse fire which damaged property in Arbon, where its Saurer
textile-machinery business is located, hasn’t materially
affected the company or its operations.  The fire, which started on the night of Aug. 19, devastated
three to four halls of the Saurer Werk II warehouse complex in
Arbon, a Swiss town on Lake Constance on the border with
 Germany , Andreas Schwarzwaelder, a spokesman, said by telephone.
The fire didn’t reach Oerlikon offices or production facilities,
he said.  Oerlikon said on March 23 that it sold Saurer Werk II to
HRS Investment AG, a Swiss real estate firm, for 35 million
Swiss francs ($36.2 million). Oerlikon has moved much of its
textile machinery business including the unit’s leadership to
 Shanghai  as part of a restructuring. It subsequently leased back
14,000 square meters of the 200,000 square-meter property.  The company has 120 production and administration employees
at the Saurer business in Arbon who have returned to work as
normal, Schwarzwaelder said.  Saurer is part of the natural fibers division of Oerlikon’s
textile unit. Natural fibers accounted for about 40 percent of
the textile unit’s 2011 sales of 2 billion Swiss francs, Chief
Executive Officer Michael Buscher said in April.  To contact the reporter on this story:
