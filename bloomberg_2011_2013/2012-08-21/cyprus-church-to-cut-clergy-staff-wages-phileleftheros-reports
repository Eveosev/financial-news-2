The  Orthodox Christian Church of
Cyprus  plans to cut the salaries of clergy and staff who earn
more than 1,500 euros ($1,865) a month given falling revenue,
 Phileleftheros  said, citing an unnamed church official.  Cyprusâ€™s economic crisis has contributed to a decline in
church revenue and its Holy Synod, or governing body, will
examine possible cuts at its next meeting on Sept. 4, the
Nicosia-based newspaper cited the synod member as saying. The
salaries of some managers at church organizations may also be
reduced by 40 percent, according to Phileleftheros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
