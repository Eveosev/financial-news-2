Belgian  consumer confidence  fell to
the lowest in six months in August amid increasing concern in
the country about the economic outlook and rising unemployment.  The consumer sentiment index for  Belgium , the euro area’s
sixth-largest economy, dropped to minus 16 in August from minus
13 in July, the Brussels-based  National Bank of Belgium  said
today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest since
February.  “Consumers are particularly pessimistic about
macroeconomic developments in Belgium,” the central bank said
in the statement. “Especially the fear of rising unemployment
weighs increasingly upon their morale, but also the general
economic outlook has deteriorated to a larger extent.”  A sub-index measuring concerns about joblessness in Belgium
climbed for a third month to 46 from 39. A sub-index gauging
householders’ assessment of the economy fell to minus 11 from
minus 7 in July, the lowest since February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
