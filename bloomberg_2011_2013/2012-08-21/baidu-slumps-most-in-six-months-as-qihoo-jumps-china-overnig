Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of  China ’s most-
used search-engine, tumbled the most in 10 months in New York on
speculation mounting competition from  Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (QIHU) 
will erode revenue.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese companies in the U.S. lost 1 percent, the most in three
weeks, to 89.75 yesterday. Baidu sank 5.7 percent, the steepest
drop since September, in its second day of declines. Qihoo, the
developer of China’s most-used Web browser, jumped to a three-
month high as analysts project the company’s outlook will beat
estimates.  Oil company   Cnooc Ltd. (883)  fell the most in a month after
first-half profit dropped.  Qihoo, which develops a web browser and security software,
started a new search engine last week, entering a market that is
80 percent dominated by Baidu. Qihoo’s forecast will probably
beat the $77.8 million average third-quarter sales estimate of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg as the  Internet company 
boosts advertising sales, Maxim Group LLC said.  “Investors realize that over time Baidu’s bottom line
could be significantly negatively affected by competition from
Qihoo,” Kevin Pollack, a managing director at Paragon Capital
in New York, said by phone yesterday. Qihoo’s search engine
“may soon cut into Baidu’s market share.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 0.5 percent to 34.29,
extending its retreat to a fifth day. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index of the biggest U.S. shares lost 0.3 percent to 1,413.17 as
a slump in technology companies overshadowed optimism euro-area
leaders will make progress in resolving the region’s debt
crisis.  Baidu Plunges  American depositary receipts of the Beijing-based Baidu
sank to $123.4, the biggest decline since Sept. 29.  Sina Corp.’s Weibo social media platform showed 14.2
percent of the 1,332 voters would choose Qihoo’s search engine,
the second among the five most popular Chinese  search engines ,
Stifel Nicolaus & Co. said in an Aug. 20 report, citing a
survey. Baidu got 76.5 percent of the votes. Search engines by
Google Inc. and Sohu.com Inc. ranked behind Qihoo.  “Qihoo search is pretty good, without commercials now,”
Tian X. Hou, founder of T.H. Capital LLC in Beijing, said by e-
mail yesterday. “The search’s relevance and inclusion rates are
similar to those of Baidu and Google, if not better.”  Competition in Video  Youku Inc. (YOKU)  and  Tudou Holdings Ltd. (TUDO) , the most-popular video
websites in China, won shareholder approval on Aug. 19 for their
merger. The combined company will compete with Baidu’s iQiyi
video unit and a similar operation of  Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) ,
China’s largest Internet company by market value.  “Despite its market dominance, Baidu is going to have
greater competition in both the search engine from Qihoo and
video areas from Youku after its acquisition of Tudou,” Paragon
Capital’s Pollack said.  Qihoo’s ADRs gained 4.4 percent to $21.1, the highest level
since May 22. Youku slid 2.7 percent to $17.6 while Tudou
declined 2.5 percent to $28.04.  ADRs of Cnooc, China’s biggest offshore oil and gas
explorer, sank 3.2 percent to $194.5 yesterday, slumping the
most since July 23. The ADRs, each representing 100 underlying
shares, traded 0.1 percent  below  its Hong Kong stock, from a
premium of 0.2 percent the previous day.  New Home Prices  Net income at the offshore oil company declined 19 percent
in the first half to 31.87 billion  yuan  ($5 billion), or 0.71
yuan a share, from 39.34 billion yuan, or 0.88 yuan, a year
earlier, Cnooc said in a statement yesterday. That compared with
the 35.07 billion yuan median estimate of seven analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Beijing-based  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN) , the largest real estate
information website in China, plunged 6.3 percent to $13.9, the
biggest tumble this month. E-House China Holdings Ltd. slumped
for a fourth day, losing 2.7 percent to $5.09, the lowest level
since Aug. 3.  China’s new home prices climbed in July from a month
earlier in 49 of the 70 cities tracked by the Chinese
government, the most since May last year, government data
released Aug. 18 showed. The government may expand a property
tax trial and raise the “threshold” for home pre-sales if
housing prices rebound too fast, Shanghai Securities News
reported Aug. 20, citing unidentified people.  Elong, Trina  Elong Inc. (LONG) , China’s second-largest online travel agency
whose biggest shareholder is Expedia Inc., surged 11 percent to
$15.95, the steepest rally since November.  The company forecast third-quarter sales will rise as much
as 20 percent from a year ago, according to a statement dated
Aug. 20.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , the world’s fourth-largest solar-panel
maker, jumped 7 percent to a three-week high of $5.18.  Trina, based in Changzhou of China’s Jiangsu province, said
yesterday it seeks to spur demand for its products by developing
 power plants  that will use them, a strategy implemented by
competitors including First Solar Inc., the largest U.S. solar
company.  Trina reported a second-quarter net loss of $92.1 million,
or $1.30 an ADR, from net income of $11.8 million, or 17 cents,
a year earlier, in a statement yesterday. Analysts had expected
a loss of $1.03 per ADR, the average of seven estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Second-quarter sales fell 40 percent to $346.1
million from a year earlier.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  advanced 0.5 percent to
2,118.27 yesterday. The Hang Seng  China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
Chinese companies increased 0.3 percent to 9,825.95.  To contact the reporter on this story:
