India ’s rupee led gains in Asian
currencies on speculation European leaders will agree on steps
to tackle the region’s debt crisis at meetings this week,
supporting demand for riskier assets.  The rupee reached a one-week high while South Korea’s won
and Taiwan’s dollar snapped four-day declines. Luxembourg Prime
Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , the head of the euro-area group of
finance ministers, visits Greece tomorrow to discuss its debt
program. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President
 Francois Hollande  meet in Berlin on Aug. 23 to consider ways to
contain Europe’s fiscal problems.  “We are seeing some recoveries in external conditions and
therefore, as long as risk sentiment is solid, funds are coming
to Asia,” said  Yuji Kameoka , chief currency strategist at Daiwa
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “Sentiment is influenced mainly by
Europe’s situation and global economic conditions.”  The rupee rose 0.4 percent to 55.51 per dollar as of 2:25
p.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The won
closed 0.4 percent stronger at 1,131.15 in Seoul, Taiwan’s
dollar gained 0.2 percent to NT$29.975 and Thailand’s baht
strengthened 0.2 percent to 31.46. Financial markets in
Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines are closed for holidays.  The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks the
region’s currencies, climbed 0.17 percent, the most in two
weeks. Its 60-day historical volatility dropped to 3.59 percent
from 3.71 percent yesterday. The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index of
stocks rose 0.4 percent.  Stock Inflows  The won rebounded from a two-week low after international
investors bought $36 million more local shares than they sold

releases tomorrow the minutes of its open-market committee
meeting held on Aug. 1. The central bank is ready to add to

reduce unemployment, it said after that meeting.  “Foreign investors’ interest in Asian stocks has revived
recently,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-
President Assets Management Corp., who helps manage $1.6 billion
of bonds. “The lack of negative news from the U.S. or Europe is
also supporting the  Taiwan dollar .”  China’s  yuan  rose 0.05 percent to 6.3562 per dollar in
Shanghai, according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
The People’s Bank of China fixed the currency’s reference rate
