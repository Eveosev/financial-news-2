Greece ’s Prime Minister Antonis Samaras said a return to the drachma would cause five more years
of recession in his country and the  unemployment rate  to exceed
40 percent,  Bild-Zeitung  reported, citing an interview.  An exit from the euro could mean the end of democracy in
Greece and lead to situation similar to the  Weimar Republic , the
newspaper cited him as saying in a preview of an article for
today’s edition.  Greece needs more time, not necessarily more money, to be
able to return to economic growth, Samaras said, according to
Bild. His government will cut staff in the public sector by
hiring one person for every ten people retiring and implement
tax and employment-law changes, he also told Bild.  To contact the reporter on this story:
