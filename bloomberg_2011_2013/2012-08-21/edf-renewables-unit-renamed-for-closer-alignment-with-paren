Enxco Inc., a U.S. unit of  EDF SA (EDF) ,
changed its name to EDF Renewable Energy to reflect its focus on
building and servicing solar, wind, biomass, hydro and biogas
projects.  The change represents a “closer alignment” with its
parent company following EDF’s 2011 purchase of the remaining 50
percent of EDF Energies Nouvelles, EDF’s French renewable energy
unit that owns Enxco, according to a statement today.  “The new brand name is a natural progression of the
integration with the EDF group,” San Diego-based EDF Renewable
Energy said in the statement. The company’s operations and
maintenance group, Enxco Service Corp., will be renamed EDF
Renewable Services and remain separate from its development
group that builds projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
