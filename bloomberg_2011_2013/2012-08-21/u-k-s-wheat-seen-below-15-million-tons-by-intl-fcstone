Wheat production in the U.K., the
European Union’s third-largest grower, may drop below 15 million
metric tons, according to INTL FCStone Inc.  The wheat harvest may be in “the mid-to-low 14 million ton
range,” analysts Jaime Nolan-Miralles and Rory Deverell said
today in an e-mailed report. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
has projected U.K.  output  at 15.5 million tons, 1.6 percent
larger than a year earlier. Excessive rains this year delayed
plant maturation and left crops susceptible to disease, the
U.K.’s Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board has said.  “Results coming from the field in the U.K. continue to
foster a large degree of variability,” Nolan-Miralles and
Deverell wrote.  France and  Germany  are the largest EU wheat growers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
