An electrical mat that reduces the
likelihood of burns for patients undergoing electrosurgery has
been recommended for use in the U.K.’s  National Health Service .  The technology, known as the Mega Soft Patient Return
Electrode, received positive guidance from the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, a body that
advises the NHS on cost-effective medical treatments. The mat is
developed by Draper, Utah-based Megadyne Medical Products Inc.,
a closely held company established in 1986.  Mega Soft is deployed during surgical procedures which use
electric currents to cauterize cuts and reduce bleeding from
incisions. The mat, which lies underneath the patient, completes
the electrical circuit between the patient and electrical
source, eliminating the need for electrode stickers to be placed
on the skin.  The electrode can provide benefits to patients with fragile
skin Carole Longson, director of NICE’s Health Technology
Evaluation Center, said in a statement today. “There are also
possible benefits for theater staff in terms of convenience and
reduced setting-up time,” said Longson.  NICE, which first began to evaluate the technology in
September, calculates the cost of the reusable mats at 1,900
pounds ($3,000) each. Positive guidance from the London-based
agency helps speed the adoption of new treatments across the 168
NHS hospital trusts in  England .  Megadyne also produces blade electrodes and generators,
according to the company’s website. The Mega Soft electrode can
be used for as long as 24 months, according to NICE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
