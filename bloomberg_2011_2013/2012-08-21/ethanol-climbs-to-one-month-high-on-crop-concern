Ethanol futures climbed to a one-
month high in Chicago on concern that the corn harvest may be
more damaged than previously estimated.  Futures followed corn higher after findings from the annual
Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour showed average yields in the
western two-thirds of  Ohio , the eighth-biggest state producer of
the grain, were down 29 percent to 110.5 bushels per acre. The
Agriculture Department estimated Aug. 10 that the yield would
fall 20 percent to an average 126 bushels from 158 last year.  “The reports out of this Pro Farmer crop tour are that
things may be worse than we thought,” said  Ian Jackson , a
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago. “It’s just a flat
price move with corn.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 4.1 cents, or
1.6 percent, to settle at $2.667 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the highest price since July 20. The futures have
gained 21 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago jumped 7.5 cents
to $2.65 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show. On the U.S.
Gulf Coast, the additive increased 6 cents to $2.71.  Ethanol in  New York  added 5 cents to $2.71 a gallon. On the
West Coast, the biofuel jumped 1 cent to $2.785.  Corn for December delivery rose 15 cents, or 1.8 percent,
to $8.3875 a bushel in  Chicago .  To contact the reporter on this story:
