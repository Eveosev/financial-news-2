Nordex SE (NDX1)  won a contract to deliver
and install nine turbines for a wind farm in southwest Finland,
the first deal under an  agreement  struck with Helsinki-based
 fund manager  Taaleritehdas Oy to finance projects.  Construction on the project, with 21.6-megawatt capacity,
will begin in the spring of 2013, Nordex said in a statement.  “This is a further key order for our N117 turbine,” said
Lars Krogsgaard, chief sales officer of Hamburg-based Nordex.  Under the June 29 agreement with Taaleritehdas, as many as
111 turbines will be shipped and installed by Nordex in projects
financed by the fund manager across Finland, with total capacity
seen at 260 megawatts. That would be more than the installed
wind-power capacity of 197 megawatts in  Finland  as of the end of
2011, according to the  Finnish Wind Power Association .  Finland  plans  to produce 38 percent of its power from
renewable energy by 2020, up from 32 percent now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
