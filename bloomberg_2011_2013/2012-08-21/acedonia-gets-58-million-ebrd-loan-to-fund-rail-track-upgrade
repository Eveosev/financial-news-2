The European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development will lend as much as 46.4 million euros ($57.8
million) to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s state-
run railroad development company.  The 15-year loan to the  Macedonian Railway Infrastructure 
supports a 60.7 million euro upgrade of the 30.8-kilometer (19-
mile) stretch from Kumanovo to Beljakovce, northeast of the
capital Skopje. The project gives the Balkan nation and its
neighbors “a whole new route for trade” with improved links to
the Black Sea ports in neighboring  Bulgaria , the London-based
lender said in an e-mailed statement.  The rail line is part of the so-called Pan European Rail
Corridor VIII that plans to link the Black Sea coast with the
Adriatic in Albania. The Macedonian project also got a 4 million
euro grant from the European Union’s  Western Balkans Investment
Framework , the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
