Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest producer of wind turbines, fired about 30 workers at a
factory in Brighton, Colorado, its second round of job cuts in
the state since last week.  Vestas, based in Aarhus, Denmark, is cutting its workforce
as the looming expiration in December of a federal tax credit
slows demand for turbines in the U.S., Andrew Longeteig, a
company spokesman, said today in an e-mail.  The company fired about 90 workers at a plant in Pueblo,
Colorado, Aug. 13. It still has about 3,000 employees in the
U.S. and Canada. Chief Executive Officer  Ditlev Engel  said in
January that as many as 1,600 U.S. jobs are at risk if lawmakers
don’t extend the production tax credit.  “We’re continuing to see Colorado’s economy pay the price
for Congress’s inaction on the wind PTC,” Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, said in an e-mailed statement.
“It’s costing us jobs.”  Mitt Romney , the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, has said he opposes extending the tax credit of 2.2
cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity produced by wind, biomass,
geothermal and landfill-gas plants, while President  Barack Obama 
is supporting it. The firings in Brighton were first reported by
the Boulder County Business Report.  Vestas shares rose 5.6 percent to 33.94 kroner in
Copenhagen today, the highest since June 1.  To contact the reporters on this story:
