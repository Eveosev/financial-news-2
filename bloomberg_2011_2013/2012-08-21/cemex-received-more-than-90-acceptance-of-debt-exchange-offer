Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO) , the largest cement maker
in the Americas, won more than 90 percent acceptance of an offer
to extend maturities on $7.25 billion of loans by three years.  “This means it’s a successful deal,”  Jim Harper , an
analyst at BCP Securities, said in a telephone interview from
Greenwich,  Connecticut . “This is good for the bonds, it’s good
for the stock.”  Support for the proposal, whose acceptance deadline was
extended to Sept. 7, bolsters Cemex’s efforts to prevent a
financing crunch in 2014 by pushing maturities to 2017. The
company has posted 11 straight quarterly losses after the U.S.
housing slump and global economic slowdown hurt demand for
building materials.  Yields on the company’s 9.25 percent bonds due in May 2020
fell 81 basis points to 9.3 percent, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The notes rose 4.3 cents on the dollar to 99.75 cents
at 3:58 p.m.  “There has been a lot of work, a lot of negotiation to get
there,” Maher Al-Haffar, Cemex’s chief of communications and
investor relations, said in a telephone interview today from
Panama City. “I don’t want to be overly optimistic, but it
seems like after going through a major storm, things are
beginning to look up for us.”  Deadline Extended  Cemex, which originally planned to close the transaction if
it won backing from holders of 95 percent of the debt, said
today the terms will be modified to allow completion with 91
percent acceptance if the higher target isn’t met by Sept. 7. In
addition to the 90 percent who agreed to the offer already,
another 1.5 percent have already indicated they plan to do so,
the Monterrey, Mexico-based company said.  “We could have more as soon as the holidays in  Europe  are
over,” Al-Haffar said. “There’s a cautiously optimistic view
that we may get to the 95 percent, which is a high threshold.”  Cemex  climbed  1.7 percent to 10.26 pesos today in Mexico
City. The shares have advanced 43 percent this year.  Based on current acceptance notices from creditors wanting
new high-yield notes that are part of the offer, Cemex said it
anticipated issuing a principal amount of $470 million. The
company said in June that it would issue as much as $500 million
of the notes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
