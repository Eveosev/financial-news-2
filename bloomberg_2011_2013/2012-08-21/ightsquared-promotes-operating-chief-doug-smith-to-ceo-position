LightSquared Inc., the bankrupt
wireless broadband venture, promoted Doug Smith to the job of
chief executive officer and said the company would overcome the
regulatory impasse that helped push it into default.  Smith, who had served as LightSquared’s co-chief operating
officer and helped design its high-speed network, will also be
chairman, the company said today in a  statement . LightSquared,
based in Reston, Virginia, filed for bankruptcy in May after
U.S. regulators said its proposed network to serve 260 million
people with high-speed mobile data service would interfere with
GPS navigation.  “LightSquared remains committed to working with all
stakeholders to find an equitable resolution to the regulatory
challenges that the company has faced this past year,” Smith
said in today’s statement.  LightSquared’s previous CEO,  Sanjiv Ahuja , resigned Feb.
28, and Smith along with Chief Financial Officer Marc Montagner
took over the co-COO job while the company searched for Ahuja’s
replacement. Prior to his executive positions at LightSquared,
Smith worked at  Clearwire Corp. (CLWR)  and  Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)   Philip Falcone , through his hedge fund Harbinger Capital
Partners, spent as much as $3 billion on LightSquared’s failed
effort to convert satellite airwaves to a mobile data network in
an attempt to build a wholesale wireless Internet service.
Falcone still serves on the board of LightSquared and is a
member of the executive committee, said Michael Tucker, a
spokesman for LightSquared.  Prior to LightSquared’s bankruptcy, lenders had requested
that Falcone step aside.  The Chapter 11 case has involved disputes with a group of
lenders including Capital Research & Management Co., Appaloosa
Management LP and  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)  over
LightSquared’s use of cash and whether it has enough money to
reorganize.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-12080,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporters on this story:
