Representative Todd Akin defied
pressure from Republican leaders, including presidential
candidate  Mitt Romney , and refused to withdraw from the Missouri
Senate race ahead of a deadline that passed today.  Akin, 65, is facing criticism and calls to step aside from
his fellow Republicans two days after he said that “legitimate
rape” rarely leads to pregnancy. Akin apologized for the remarks
and vowed to stay in the race against Senator  Claire McCaskill ,
who Republicans view as vulnerable as they seek to wrest control
of the Senate from Democrats.  Akin faced a 5 p.m. Central Time deadline today to take his
name off the ballot without a court order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
