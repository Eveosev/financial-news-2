The Czech energy regulator plans to
reduce subsidies for electricity generated by solar panels
installed on rooftops next year,  Lidove Noviny  reported, citing
calculations based on a proposal posted on the regulatorâ€™s
website.  Purchase price of electricity from rooftop solar panels may
fall from the current 6.16 koruna ($0.31) per kilowatthour to
about 3.5 koruna per kilowatthour in the second half of 2013,
the newspaper said. Power from larger rooftop installations with
a capacity between 5 kilowatts and 30 kilowatts will fetch even
lower prices, according to the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
