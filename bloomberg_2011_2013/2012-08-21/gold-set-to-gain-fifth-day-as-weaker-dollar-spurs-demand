Gold rose to the highest since early
May on speculation that minutes from the  Federal Reserve ’s last
meeting may signal that the bank is ready to add more stimulus
measures. Platinum climbed to a three-month high.  The U.S. central bank is slated to publish tomorrow minutes
from its two-day meeting that ended on Aug. 1. Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  may talk about monetary stimulus options at a
conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at the end of this month.
Gold also gained as a weaker dollar boosted the metal’s appeal
as an alternative investment.  “There’s a lot of monetary-easing chatter going around
with the chairman going to Jackson Hole,”  Frank McGhee , the
head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in Chicago,
said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery increased 1.1 percent to
$1,641.50 an ounce at 9:53 a.m. on the Comex in New York, after
reaching $1,642.90, the highest since May 7. The price is headed
for a fifth straight session of gains.  In 2010, at the Kansas City Fed’s annual monetary symposium
in  Jackson Hole , Bernanke foreshadowed a $600 billion bond-
purchase program. Prices have jumped more than 30 percent since
then.  The dollar fell as much as 0.7 percent against a basket of
six currencies today.  Platinum futures for October delivery climbed 0.6 percent
to $1,506.80 an ounce, after touching $1,509.60, the highest
since May 9.  Lonmin Plc (LMI)  said 33 percent of workers at the Marikana
complex in South Africa, the biggest platinum-producing country,
returned to work today after clashes with police last week led
to strikers’ deaths. Police shot dead 34 striking workers and
injured 78 others at Lonmin’s Marikana platinum mining complex
on Aug. 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
