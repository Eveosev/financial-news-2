Taiwan’s dollar rose the most this
month on speculation European leaders will make progress in
tackling their region’s debt crisis, boosting appetite for
riskier assets.  Global funds bought $411 million more local shares than
they sold today, taking net purchases this month to $3 billion,
according to exchange data. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President  Francois Hollande  meet in Berlin on Aug. 23 to
discuss the fiscal crisis, and both are set to talk separately
with Greece’s Prime Minister Antonis Samaras later in the week.  “Foreign investors’ interest in Asian stocks has revived
recently,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-
President Assets Management Corp., who helps manage $1.6 billion
of fixed-income assets. “The lack of negative news from the
U.S. or  Europe  is also supporting the  Taiwan dollar .”  Taiwan’s dollar closed 0.2 percent stronger at NT$29.75
against its U.S. counterpart, the biggest gain since July 31,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 20
basis points to 3.2 percent.  Official data showed yesterday Taiwan’s export orders
slumped 4.4 percent in July, declining for a fifth month.  Government bonds  fell after the Ministry of Finance
auctioned NT$30 billion ($1 billion) of 30-year debt today at a
higher yield than investors expected. The notes were sold at
1.738 percent, compared to the 1.71 percent median estimate of
six fixed-income traders surveyed by Bloomberg.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent notes due March 2022
rose one basis point to 1.191 percent, according to Gretai
Securities Market. The  overnight money-market rate  was little
changed at 0.386 percent, according to a weighted average
compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
