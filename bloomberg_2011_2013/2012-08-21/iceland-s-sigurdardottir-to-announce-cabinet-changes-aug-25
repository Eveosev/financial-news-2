Iceland’s Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir will announce changes to her cabinet on Aug. 25
after briefing her fellow  Social Democrats  on the moves, she
told state broadcaster RUV.  The changes are designed to prepare the government for next
year’s parliamentary elections and facilitate the reduction of
ministries from 10 to eight, approved by the island’s parliament
on May 11 and set to take place on Sept. 1.  A new Industry and Innovation Ministry will replace the
current Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism and the
Ministry of Fisheries and Agriculture. The duties of the
Ministry of Economic and Business Affairs will be divided
between that new ministry and the  Ministry of Finance , which
will be renamed the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs.
The  Environment Ministry  will be renamed the Ministry for the
Environment and Natural Resources.  “I’m obligated to discuss this in a party board meeting
and then with” the Social Democratic lawmakers on Aug. 25,
Sigurdardottir told the Reykjavik-based  broadcaster . “My motion
will be discussed then and hopefully approved.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
