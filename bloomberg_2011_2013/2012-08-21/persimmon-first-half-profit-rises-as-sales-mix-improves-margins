Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the U.K.’s largest
homebuilder by market value, increased profit before items by 65
percent in the first half as it sold more family houses to lift
margins.  Pretax profit excluding one-time gains and losses rose to
98.7 million pounds ($155 million) from 59.7 million pounds a
year earlier, the York, England-based company said today in a
statement. Revenue climbed 13 percent, while net asset value
increased by 4 percent to 625.7 pence a share.  Persimmon lifted its operating margin to 12.2 percent of
sales from 9 percent a year earlier as it built and sold more
family houses on discounted land bought after prices fell in the
2009 recession. Chief Executive Officer Mike Farley is using the
cash reserves generated by the company to pledge 1.9 billion
pounds of dividend payments through 2021 and to step up land
purchases.  “We’re well on track to delivering the 75 pence dividend
in 2013,” Farley said on a conference call.  Persimmon declined 2.5 pence in London trading to 702.5
pence as of 8:10 a.m. That reduced the company’s market value to
2.15 billion pounds.  The shares were the third-best performers in the 10-member
 U.K. Home Builder Index (BNUKHBLD) , gaining 50 percent from the start of
the year through yesterday. The index has climbed almost 34
percent in the same period, reflecting homebuilders’ efforts to
restore profits even as new home completions dropped last year
to the lowest during peacetime since 1924.  Government Push  The British government is seeking to boost housing starts
by loosening social housing requirements in planning consents
and encouraging investment by housing associations, non-profit
residential landlords, the Financial Times reported last week.  Persimmon’s home completions rose 6 percent to 4,712 as the
average selling price increased 7 percent to 171,206 pounds.
Pre-sales of homes to be built increased 4 percent to 1.04
billion pounds.  The company acquired 50 sites suitable for 5,779 homes
during the first half, giving it a land bank equivalent to 6.5
years of sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
