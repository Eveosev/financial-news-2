Workers at  Argentina ’s  Agricultural
Sanitary Agency  will go on strike for three days, hindering
exports of grain and beef and imports of fertilizers, Guillermo
Wade, an official at the port exporters chamber, said by
telephone from the city of Rosario.  The strike at the agency, known as Senasa, will start at
midnight local time and will prevent exporters and importers
from obtaining certificates for their shipments at ports in
Buenos Aires,  Bahia Blanca  and Rosario, Wade said.  “Certificates are mandatory for grain, beef exports and
fertilizers importation, so trade will be delayed,” he said.  Senasa workers haven’t received a response from the
government for their request for a 20 percent pay rise, the
sanitary union Apumag said in its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
