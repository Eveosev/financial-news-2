IHI Corp. a Japanese maker of heavy
machinery, acquired as much as 50 percent stakes in five  power
plants  in California from  Exelon Corp. (EXC)   IHI bought shares in three biomass power plants and two
coal-fired stations, which the company plans to convert to
biomass, IHI said in a statement today without disclosing any
financial details.  The two coal-fired plants are Rio Bravo Jasmin and Rio
Bravo Poso stations, each with a capacity of 33 megawatts,
according to the statement.  The rest of the plants, all biomass, are the 25-megawatt
Chinese Station, Rio Bravo Rocklin and Rio Bravo Fresno, both
with 28 megawatts of capacity, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
