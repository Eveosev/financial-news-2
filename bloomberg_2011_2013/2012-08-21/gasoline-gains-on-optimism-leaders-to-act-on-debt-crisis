Gasoline rose amid speculation that
European leaders will make progress this week on containing the
region’s debt crisis, which has threatened the global economy
and fuel demand.  Futures advanced for a second day as a senior lawmaker with
 Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s party said concessions are possible
for  Greece  to meet the main targets in its bailout program. The
dollar slipped to a six-week low versus the euro, helping spark
a broad rally in commodities.  “The signs are that they’re going to cut a deal on Greece
and that Merkel is going to give in a little bit,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .
“Bailouts are bullish for the market.”  September-delivery gasoline rose 3.44 cents, or 1.1
percent, to settle at $3.0652 a gallon on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Futures have climbed 20 percent from this
year’s low close of $2.5501 on June 21.  European leaders are meeting this week to discuss ways for
nations in the region to pay their debts.  “This is providing a little bit of optimism for the
market,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount
Options Inc. in  New York .  The euro was up 0.9 percent at 3:14 p.m. in New York. A
weaker dollar increases the investment appeal of commodities.  Commodities Rally  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 materials
touched the highest level since May 3 and was up 0.9 percent at
3:14 p.m. The gauge has jumped 21 percent from 559 on June 21.  A report by the Energy Department tomorrow will probably
show that gasoline inventories fell 1.35 million barrels last
week, according to the median estimate of 12 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. In the week ended Aug. 10, stockpiles declined
to the lowest for this time of the year since 2008, department
data show.  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
probably rose 1 million barrels last week, based on the survey.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 3.12 cents, or 1
percent, to $3.1243 a gallon, the highest close since May 2.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.3
cent to $3.717 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. That’s the
second straight day that prices have been at a daily high.
