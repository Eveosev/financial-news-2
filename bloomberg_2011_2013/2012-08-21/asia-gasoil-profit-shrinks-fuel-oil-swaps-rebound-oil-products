Asia ’s gasoil crack spread shrank
for the first time in five days, signaling reduced profit for
refiners making the distillate fuel.  Fuel-oil  swaps rose for the
ninth time in 10 days.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian marker Dubai
crude fell 75 cents from Aug. 17 to $19.05 a barrel at 12 p.m.
Singapore time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.,
a broker. This  crack spread  measures processing profit.  Gasoil swaps for September dropped 75 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $129.55 a barrel, PVM said. Prices were down for a second day.
Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil rose 15 cents to 80 cents. A wider
 regrade  indicates it’s more profitable to produce  aviation fuel 
than diesel.  Fuel Oil  High-sulfur fuel oil climbed 35 cents to $3.10 a barrel
below Dubai crude, according to PVM. The  discount  narrowed for
the fourth time in five days, showing reduced losses for
refiners turning crude into residual products.  Fuel-oil swaps for September rebounded $2.25, or 0.3
percent, to $682 a metric ton, PVM data showed. The premium of
180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade, or the
 viscosity spread , was unchanged after decreasing last week to
$12.50. This means bunker, or marine fuel, moved in tandem with
higher-quality supplies used in power stations.  Light Distillates  Naphtha swaps for September increased $1.50, or 0.2 percent,
at $952.50 a ton, according to PVM. The petrochemical and
gasoline feedstock was up for the third time in four days.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures was
little changed after rising to $94.38 a ton, the highest since
early May, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Gasoline’s
premium to naphtha on Aug. 17 lost 81 cents to $22.47 a barrel,
data compiled by Bloomberg showed. A narrowing  reforming margin 
signals it is less profitable to make motor fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
