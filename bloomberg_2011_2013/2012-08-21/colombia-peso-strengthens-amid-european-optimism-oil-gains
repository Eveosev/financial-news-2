Colombia’s peso advanced amid gains
in crude oil, the nation’s biggest export, and on speculation
European leaders will make progress in resolving the region’s
debt crisis.  The peso appreciated 0.4 percent to 1,814.10 per  U.S.
dollar  at the close of trading in Bogota. It dropped 1.6 percent
last week on speculation officials will take more measures to
stem a 6.9 percent advance this year, the best performance
worldwide after the Hungarian forint and the Chilean currency.  A senior lawmaker with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
party said concessions are possible for Greece as long as Prime
Minister Antonis Samaras shows willingness to meet the main
targets set out in his country’s bailout program.  “It’s a worrying situation, but concerns have eased and
that helps drive gains,” Julian Cardenas, the chief economist
at ING Pensiones y Cesantias, said by phone from Bogota. Crude’s
advance to a three-month high is also leading to gains in the
peso, he said.  Crude oil for September delivery rose to $96.68 a barrel on
the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement since
May 10.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent peso-denominated debt
due in July 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 6.61 percent. The price dropped 0.327 centavo to
127.334 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
