Village Main Reef Ltd. (VIL)  rose the most
in almost three months after the South African gold miner posted
a 36 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit as it benefitted from
higher prices of the metal.  The shares advanced 6.1 percent, the most since May 31, to
1.40 rand by the close in Johannesburg.  Earnings per share increased to 9.81 cents in the three
months through June from 7.19 cents the previous quarter, the
company said in a statement today. Operating profit increased to
114.4 million rand ($14 million), boosted by the acquisition of
the Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining Company Ltd. on June 1. Sales
were “positively impacted” by a higher realised gold price of
423,872 rand per kilogram over the quarter, up 1 percent from
the previous three-month period, it said.  “We have made great progress in strengthening our balance
sheet over the last 12 months,” Joint Chief Executive Officer
Marius Saaiman said in the statement. “Production volumes are
traditionally higher during the September quarter than those
achieved during the June quarter, and we expect all our
operations to follow this trend.”  The company’s Consolidated Murchison Mine in  South Africa ’s
Limpopo province produced 1,436 tons of antimony in the three
months, from 909 tons the previous quarter, as it benefitted
from better grade control and the company deployed more
machinery to produce the mineral used to harden lead.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
