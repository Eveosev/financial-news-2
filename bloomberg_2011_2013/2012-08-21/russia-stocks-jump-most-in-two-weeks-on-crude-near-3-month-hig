seven weeks as oil rallied, boosting investor appetite for

will continue to support the global economic recovery.  “Oil is up nicely, this is especially positive for
Russia,”  Neil Shearing , chief  emerging-markets  economist at
 Capital Economics  in  London , said by phone. “When oil rallies,
Russian equities rise. There’s optimism in the markets that the
