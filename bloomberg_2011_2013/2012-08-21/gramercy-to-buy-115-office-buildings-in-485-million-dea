Gramercy Capital Corp. (GKK) , a real
estate investment trust that finances commercial property,
agreed to buy 115 office buildings from an affiliate of KBS Real
Estate Investment Trust Inc. in a deal valued at $485 million.  Gramercy, in a joint venture with Garrison Investment
Group, will acquire the properties for $470 million in cash and
6 million of its shares, valued at $15 million, the New York-
based REIT said today in a statement. Gramercy and Garrison each
hold a 50 percent interest in the venture.  The portfolio comprises 5.6 million square feet (520,000
square meters) of office space, 81 percent of which is leased to
to  Bank of America Corp.  through June 2023. The buildings were
previously part of Gramercy’s realty division and were
transferred to KBS in September as part of a deal to settle
$549.7 million in mortgage debt.  “This agreement begins the implementation of our strategy
to create durable, recurring cash flows through the ownership of
long-term leased properties,” Gordon F. DuGan, Gramercy’s chief
executive officer, said in the statement. He was named CEO in
June after Gramercy decided to remain independent following a
strategic review.  The office portfolio is about 88 percent occupied, and its
projected operating income this year is about $41.5 million,
Gramercy said. The deal is expected to be completed in the
fourth quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
