Football Federation  Australia  said
Chief Executive Officer Ben Buckley is stepping down and will be
replaced by former National Rugby League CEO David Gallop.  Buckley, who was appointed in November 2008, will step down
at the conclusion of negotiations for the FFAâ€™s new broadcast
deal in about two months, the Sydney-based soccer governing body
said today in an e-mailed statement.  Gallop, who left his role as CEO of the Australian Rugby
League Commission in June, will take over before the end of the
year with the commencement date to be confirmed, the FFA said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
