Iceland’s state prosecutor indicted
 Gunnar Andersen , the former head of the island’s  Financial
Supervisory Authority , for violating banking secrecy by
gathering information on one of the country’s lawmakers.  Andersen collected information on the personal finances of
opposition Independence Party lawmaker  Gudlaugur Thor Thordarson 
and leaked it to newspaper DV, Deputy State Prosecutor Helgi
Magnus Gunnarsson said in an e-mail today.  Andersen was in March this year fired from the Reykjavik-
based watchdog, which he took over in 2009, for not disclosing
financial holdings. He couldn’t immediately be reached for a
comment on his mobile phone.  He faces up to one year in prison, according to Iceland’s
 penal code .  To contact the reporter on this story:
