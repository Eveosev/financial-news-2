Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to increase exports of Forcados crude to seven
cargoes of 950,000 barrels each in October, one more than
September, a loading plan obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The nation will also ship five lots of Bonga, five Brass
River, four Escravos and two Antan blend, according to separate
loading programs. The size of each consignment ranges from
237,000 barrels to 1 million barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
