State-owned Belarusbank, the largest
lender in Belarus by assets, plans to start accepting  American
Express Co. (AXP)  cards, becoming the country’s second bank to open
its payments network to the New York-based company.  “Our system is practically ready to accept American
Express cards,” Illia Shalanki, a deputy chairman of
Belarusbank’s management board, told reporters today in the
capital, Minsk.  Belarusbank and BPS-Sberbank, the local unit of Russia’s
biggest lender,  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , will service AmEx cardholders at
their joint nationwide network of about 30,000 terminals,
Shalanki said.  BPS-Sberbank was the first Belarusian lender to strike a
partnership with American Express, the biggest credit-card
issuer by purchases, in 2010. AmEx lacks a branch network and
doesn’t issue debit cards linked to checking accounts, the
world’s fastest-growing payment method.  To contact the reporter on this story:
