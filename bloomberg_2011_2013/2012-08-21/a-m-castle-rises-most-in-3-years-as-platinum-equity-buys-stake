A.M. Castle & Co. (CAS) , a U.S. metals
distributor rose the most in more than three years after
billionaire Tom Gores’ investment firm Platinum Equity LLC
bought a stake in the company and said it might try to buy the
rest.  A.M. Castle, based in  Chicago , rose 27 percent to $11.69 at
the close in New York, the biggest gain since March 10, 2009.  Platinum Equity, based in  Beverly Hills ,  California , bought
a 6 percent stake through metal distributor Ryerson Inc.,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission yesterday. The shareholders plan to discuss
alternatives including a possible acquisition of A.M. Castle by
Platinum or Ryerson, according to the filing.  Platinum could cut costs by combining the two distributors
said Timothy Hayes, an analyst at Davenport & Co. in Richmond,
Virginia.  “Platinum’s already there and they can bring in Castle
which allows them to gain synergies if they fold in Castle with
their other service centers,” Hayes said in a telephone
interview.  The company is searching for a new chief executive officer
after the departure of Michael H. Goldberg in May in what the
company said was “a proactive decision by the company’s board
of directors to identify and hire a CEO who will effectively
execute A.M. Castle’s strategy and deliver improved returns for
shareholders.”  A.M. Castle has a market value of $269.9 million. Platinum
bought Ryerson for $915 million in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
