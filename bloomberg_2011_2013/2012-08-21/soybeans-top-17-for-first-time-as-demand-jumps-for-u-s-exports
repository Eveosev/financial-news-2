Soybeans rallied to a record,
surging above $17 a bushel, as the worst U.S. drought in half a
century damaged crops and threatened to cut global inventories
already eroded by last season’s dry weather in  South America .  Prices at all-time highs will raise costs for importers
including China, the world’s biggest buyer, and meat  producers 
including Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc., which use
soybean meal and grains in  animal feed . Recent rains have failed
to revive Midwest crops, with U.S. corn and soybean  conditions 
rated the worst since 1988, while export demand for the oilseed
remains robust, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Crop prices have led gains this year on the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 commodities, with corn soaring to a
record $8.49 a bushel on Aug. 10 on the  Chicago  Board of Trade,
while soybeans surged 41 percent. The rally spurred the biggest
jump in global  food  prices since November 2009, according to the
 United Nations . The world food  import bill  will top $1 trillion
for a third year this year, the UN said in May.  “We would expect at some point to see soybeans trade at
$20 a bushel,” Chris Gadd, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.
in  London , said today by telephone. “The devastation seen in
South America earlier this year left soybeans very tightly
supplied prior to the issues in the U.S. this summer.”  Soybeans for November delivery rose 1.7 percent to $17.1175
a bushel on the CBOT as of 1:09 p.m. London time, after touching
$17.1275, an all-time high for the most-active contract.
Soybean-meal futures for December delivery gained 1.7 percent to
$521.60 per 2,000 pounds, after reaching a record $522.70.  World Supplies  World soybean stockpiles at the end of the 2011-12 season
tumbled 26 percent from a year earlier to 51.9 million metric
tons, as output plunged in Brazil and  Argentina , according to
the USDA. The agency expects inventories to rebound to 53.4
million tons in the upcoming season. Still, U.S. output may be
hampered further as persistent dry weather spurs more farmers to
abandon fields, Gadd said.  U.S. soybean export inspections jumped to 21.4 million
bushels in the week ended Aug. 16, up 36 percent from a week
earlier, USDA said yesterday. Soybeans are the fourth-largest
global crop, after corn, rice and wheat.  In  Ohio , the sixth-largest U.S. soybean-producing state
last year, analysts on the annual Pro Farmer Midwest Crop Tour
found soybean-pod counts that were about 18 percent lower than
last year. The group estimated corn yields 29 percent smaller
than last year, according to findings released yesterday.  South Dakota  In  South Dakota , crop tour participants pegged yield
potential for both crops at 47 percent lower than last year. The
tour will take corn and soybean samples this week in  Indiana ,
Illinois,  Iowa ,  Nebraska  and  Minnesota .  Corn for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to $8.285 a
bushel. Wheat futures gained 0.6 percent to $9.08 a bushel in
Chicago. In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat climbed 1
percent to 265.50 euros ($329.88) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  About 23 percent of U.S. corn was rated good or  excellent 
for a third straight week, unchanged from a week earlier, while
31 percent of soybeans received the top ratings, the USDA said
yesterday. Both ratings were the lowest for the date since 1988.
Areas of Iowa and Illinois, the largest corn and soybean growing
states, had more than an inch (2.5 centimeters) of rain in the
past week, after receiving less than half of normal moisture in
the past two months, National Weather Service data show.  “The stabilization of crop conditions is providing a false
sense of security,”  Wayne Gordon , a strategist at UBS AG in New
York, said in a report dated yesterday. Early harvest results
show poor grain quality and quantity and “anecdotes suggest
abandonment is higher than the USDA forecast,” he said,
referring to corn.  The USDA on Aug. 10 cut its soybean production forecast to
2.69 billion bushels, the lowest since 2007, while the corn
harvest was reduced to 10.779 billion bushels, a six-year low.  To contact the reporters on this story:
