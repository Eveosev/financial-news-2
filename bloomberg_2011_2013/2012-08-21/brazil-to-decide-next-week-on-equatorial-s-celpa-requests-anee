Brazil’s electricity regulator Aneel
will decide next week on a series of requests made by  Equatorial
Energia SA (EQTL3)  regarding Centrais Eletricas do Para SA, or Celpa,
said Nelson Hubner, the regulator’s general director.  Equatorial, which is offering to take over the utility
that’s operating under  bankruptcy protection , is looking for an
easing of service targets and fines during a transitional
period, Hubner told reporters in Brasilia today.  Celpa had a meeting of creditors delayed for a third time
this week, Judge Maria Filomena De Almeida Buarque said Aug. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
