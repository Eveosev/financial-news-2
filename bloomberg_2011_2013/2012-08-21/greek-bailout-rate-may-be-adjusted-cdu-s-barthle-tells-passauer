Greece’s international creditors may
adjust the interest on its bailout loans,  Norbert Barthle , a
senior lawmaker of German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s party, was
quoted as saying by the  Passauer Neue Presse .  Greece must meet the economic targets set out in its aid
programs, the German newspaper cited the Christian Democratic
Union’s budget spokesman as saying in an interview. Only small
tweaks are imaginable, such as on interest rates, Barthle was
quoted as saying.  Merkel and Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras meet in
Berlin on Aug. 24 for talks on Greece’s debt crisis, which has
rippled through the rest of the 17-nation euro area and the
global economy since erupting in late 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
