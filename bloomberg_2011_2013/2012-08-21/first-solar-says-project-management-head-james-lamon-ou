First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the panel maker
that hired a new chief executive officer in May, is seeking a
head for its project construction unit after Senior Vice
President James Lamon left.  Department heads have assumed Lamon’s roles on an interim
basis during the search for a replacement, Ted Meyer, a
spokesman for the Tempe, Arizona-based company, said today in a
phone interview. Meyer declined to say when Lamon left or why.  Lamon, who was senior vice president for project
engineering, construction and maintenance at First Solar, joined
the company in 2008. He is a former president of the Shaw
Group’s power division, according to  his profile  on LinkedIn,
which lists him as having retired from First Solar this month.
Lamon didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  Jim Hughes, a former executive at Accelergy Corp., was
hired to take over as CEO of First Solar in May from Chairman
 Mike Ahearn , who held the position on an interim basis after
ousting Rob Gillette in October.  First Solar  rose  7.5 percent to $24.14 at the close in  New
York . The shares have gained 63 percent in the past month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
