Electric Power Development Co. (9513) , a
Japanese power generator and distributor, will build a 19.5-
megawatt wind power station in Oma in  Aomori prefecture .  Construction for the plant, which will have 10  wind
turbines , will start as early as June and operations will begin
in March 2015 at the earliest, spokesman Junichiro Hoshino said
today by phone.  J-Power held a meeting with the town assembly yesterday to
discuss the change of location within the town as the original
site included farm land, he said.  The company hasn’t disclosed the cost of the project and
hasn’t picked manufacturers for the turbines, according to the
spokesman.  To contact the reporter on this story:
