Camco International Ltd. (CAO) , a
developer of clean-energy projects, won a U.S. Treasury grant of
about $6 million to repay a loan used to build a plant that
generates power from cow manure.  The 4.5-megawatt capacity plant captures gas for renewable
power generation from dung at a farm that has 15,000 dairy cows
in Jerome,  Idaho , Camco said today in a statement.  The cash was awarded as part of the federal grant program
established by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009. The project was completed earlier this year at a cost of
about $22 million and is the largest dairy-biogas plant in  North
America , according to Camco.  “If you put aside utilities, two other areas in the U.S.
where we believe emissions need to be reduced significantly in
the next five, 10 to 15 years are agriculture and transport,”
Chief Executive Officer  Scott McGregor  said by phone.  Camco plans to build about $200 million of projects in the
U.S. that target agricultural emissions, and expects to reach
financial close on some ventures this year, he said.  The company already has anaerobic digesters at farms in
 Minnesota  and is working with one of Michigan’s largest dairy
farms to generate power from manure. Projects typically have
loans covering 70 percent of the cost, McGregor said, declining
to specify the lender for its Idaho anaerobic digester.  Camco, also a developer of traded emission credits, is
targeting expansion in Southeast Asia and this month said it
plans to build a power plant in Malaysia fed by waste from a
palm-oil plantation.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
