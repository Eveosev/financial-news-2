Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  said its bid to bring a
new rheumatoid arthritis pill to the market has been delayed as
much as three months by U.S. regulators.  The decision by the Food and Drug Administration had been
expected after New York-based Pfizer said on July 31 it would
provide the agency with additional analysis of existing data
that may require more time to review. The FDA had been scheduled
to decide on approval of the drug, called tofacitinib, by today
and now will have until Nov. 21.  “The FDA determined that additional data analyses recently
submitted by Pfizer constitute a major amendment to the
application and will require additional time to review,” Pfizer
said in a statement today announcing the delay.  Tofacitinib is a pill that inhibits part of the immune
system that can cause rheumatoid arthritis. If approved, it may
generate $2.3 billion in annual sales for Pfizer by 2018,
according to an estimate by  Seamus Fernandez , an analyst with
Leerink Swann & Co. in Boston. It would compete with  Abbott
Laboratories (ABT)  Humira and  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) ’s Remicade.  Pfizer  shares  fell less than 1 percent to $23.69 at the
close of New York trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
