Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  will keep
expanding in agriculture and sees room to grow in Brazil and the
U.S. after completing the acquisition of  Viterra Inc. (VT)   Glencore agreed to buy Regina, Saskatchewan-based Viterra
in March to add grain assets in Canada and Australia as growth
in Asia boosts demand. The company may expand through building
its own assets, as well as acquisitions, Chris Mahoney, director
for Agricultural Products, said today on a conference call.  “Do we stop there? I think no,” Mahoney said, referring
to Viterra. “We don’t have anything in the U.S. Viterra has a
bit but not too much. There’s perhaps more that can be done in
Brazil. There is room for growth.” The company is waiting for
 China ’s approval to complete the Viterra acquisition, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
