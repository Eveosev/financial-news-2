Aziende Chimiche Riunite Angelini
Francesco Acraf SpA sued an affiliate of Icelandic generic
drugmaker Actavis Group HF for infringing a patent for the
antidepressant Oleptro.  Actavis South Atlantic LLC, based in Sunrise,  Florida ,
plans to sell copies of the drug before the patent expires,
Rome-based Angelini said in a complaint filed today in federal
court in Wilmington,  Delaware .  “Plaintiffs will be irreparably harmed by defendant’s
infringing activities” unless stopped by the court, according
to the complaint.  The Italian company asked for a permanent injunction
against Actavis’s sale of copies of the drug until patent
protection ends in 2029.  David Myers Jr., a U.S. spokesman for Actavis, didn’t
immediately return voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Aziende Chimiche v. Actavis, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington.)  To see the patent, click: 8,133,893.  To contact the reporter on this story:
