New York  Mets pitcher  Johan Santana 
is scheduled to have tests today to determine why he’s
experiencing stiffness in his back.  Santana, who missed the 2011 Major League Baseball season
following surgery on his pitching shoulder, is 0-5 with a 15.63
earned run average in his past five starts. The 33-year-old
left-hander, who on June 1 threw the first no-hitter in
franchise history, is 6-9 with a 4.85 ERA in 21 starts this
season.  Santana went on the disabled list last month with a
sprained right ankle. Since returning on Aug. 11, he’s given up
14 runs in 6 1/3 innings over two starts.  With the Mets out of playoff contention at 57-65, General
Manager  Sandy Alderson  and manager Terry Collins recently
discussed shutting Santana down for the rest of the season.
Collins said after last night’s 3-1 loss to the  Colorado Rockies 
that Santana would have a scan on his back today.  “It’s not just what I’m thinking or what they’re
thinking,” Santana told reporters before last night’s game.
“We have come a long way, and they know that. And I’m very
happy with everything that I’ve been able to accomplish. Even
though I’ve been struggling lately, that doesn’t mean that you
can’t see positives around everything that I have done.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
