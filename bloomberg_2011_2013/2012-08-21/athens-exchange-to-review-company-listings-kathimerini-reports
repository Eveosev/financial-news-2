The Athens Exchange is reviewing its
FTSE indexes to include more mid-size companies,  Kathimerini 
reported, citing Athens Exchange President Socrates Lazaridis.  Changes to the bourse are intended to help mid-size
companies attract attention from foreign funds and give more
emphasis to price-to-earnings and equity ratios, the newspaper
cited Lazaridis as saying. The exchange will also add an index
consisting of exporting companies, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
