Nine Entertainment Co., the
Australian media company owned by private equity group CVC Asia
Pacific, retained broadcast rights to rugby league matches in
the country alongside pay-television broadcaster Fox Sports.  Nine and Fox Sports will pay A$1.02 billion ($1.07 billion)
to broadcast games over five years, the Australian Rugby League
Commission said today. That compares to the A$1.25 billion that
 Seven West Media Ltd. (SWM) , Foxtel and Telstra Corp. paid for rights
to Australian Football League matches in April 2011.  The ARL Commission, which runs rugby league in  Australia ,
said in a statement it signed the agreement following “several
days of intense negotiations with representatives of all
commercial television networks.” The deal is worth A$925
million in cash, with the balance to be made up in advertising
packages worth A$100 million, Commission chairman John Grant
said.  “It’s been a difficult, complex and at times stressful
process,” Grant said at a televised news conference in Sydney.
“For our game it is the greatest deal ever done.”  Rugby league is Australia’s most-watched winter sport,
attracting a cumulative audience of 128 million in 2011,
according to market researcher Oztam Pty. which compiles
Australian TV ratings.  Channel Nine  will retain State of Origin inter-state games
and continue to broadcast three free-to-air National Rugby
League matches each weekend, the commission said. Fox Sports
will show five games across Saturday, Sunday and Monday, while
both broadcasters will show Four Nations tournament matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
