OPEC should maintain its production
ceiling at its next meeting in December because  oil prices  have
been rising, Kuwait’s Oil Minister Hani Abdulaziz Hussain said,
according to the  Al Rai  newspaper.  The market is “balanced,” with positive effects from a
better-than-expected performance in the  U.S. economy  and
stability in Europe, he said, the Kuwaiti paper reported. The
crude oil market will have a surplus, leading to a decline in
prices, once the international crisis over Iran’s nuclear
program eases and the Islamic country’s oil exports return to
normal, he said.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries comprises
Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria,
Qatar,  Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. It
plans to meet next on Dec. 12.  To contact the reporters on this story:
