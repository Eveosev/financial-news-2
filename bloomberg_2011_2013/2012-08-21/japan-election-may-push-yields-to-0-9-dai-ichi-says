Japan ’s benchmark bond yield may
rise to levels not seen in almost four months if elections spur
concern fiscal reforms will be set aside, according to Taisuke Sughino, deputy general manager at Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co.  The opposition party-controlled upper house this month
ratified legislation to double the 5 percent tax by 2015 after
Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  pledged to call elections
“soon.” The lower house passed the bill in June, causing more
than 50 ruling  Democratic Party  of Japan legislators to leave.  “While the passage of the sales tax hike bill is easing
immediate concerns about the fiscal situation, if the Diet is
dissolved and there’s a general election, the possibility that
cost-cutting measures will be shelved could raise concerns among
foreign investors,” Sughino said.  Election issues could send the 10-year note yield to 0.9
percent by year end, he said in an interview on Aug. 17. The
rate declined 1 1/2 basis point, or 0.015 percentage point, to
0.835 percent as of 1:21 p.m. in  Tokyo  today, and it hasn’t been
at 0.9 percent or higher since April 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
