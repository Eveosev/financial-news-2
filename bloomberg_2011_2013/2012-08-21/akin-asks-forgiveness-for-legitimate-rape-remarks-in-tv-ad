Rep. Todd Akin, the Republican
Senate candidate in  Missouri , has until the end of today to
remove his name from the fall ballot. That’s what party leaders
are advising him to do, following his televised remarks Sunday
calling pregnancy rare in the case of “legitimate rape.”  Instead, Akin is seeking forgiveness, Bloomberg’s  Political
Capital blog  reported today. With a 30-second ad opening with a
picture of the congressman and his wife, Akin makes a solo and
personal appeal to voters in Missouri: “Rape is an evil act,”
Akin says to the camera.  “I used the wrong words in the wrong way, and for that I
apologize,” says Akin, noting that he is the father of two
daughters and wants “tough justice” for any “predators,”
while holding compassion for any victims. He prays for them.  “The fact is, rape can lead to pregnancy,” Akin says.
“The truth is, rape has many victims.”  The mistake he made, he says in closing, “was in the words
I said, not in the heart I hold.”  The day ahead promises to be as dramatic as the ad Akin is
airing. The chairman of the  Republican Party  has called on him
to quit the race. The chairman of Senate campaign fundraising
has suggested he consider quitting. The super-PAC airing ads
against the Democratic incumbent, Senator  Claire McCaskill , is
pulling its commercials. The presidential ticket of  Mitt Romney 
and  Paul Ryan  has made their position known, too.  To contact the reporter on this story:
