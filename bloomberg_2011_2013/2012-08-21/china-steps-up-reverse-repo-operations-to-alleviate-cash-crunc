China ’s central bank stepped up
reverse-repurchase operations today to ease a cash crunch,
injecting 150 billion yuan using seven-day contracts and a
further 70 billion yuan via 14-day agreements, according to a
trader at a primary dealer required to bid at the auctions.  That’s the biggest one-day injection since the current
round of reverse repos started in late June. The previous high
was 143 billion yuan on July 3.  The seven-day repurchase rate was eight basis points higher
at 3.71 percent as of 10:05 a.m. in Shanghai, according to a
weighted average. The one-year interest-rate swap fell one basis
point to 3.03 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
