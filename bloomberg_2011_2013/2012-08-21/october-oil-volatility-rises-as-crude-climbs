Volatility on near-term crude
options rose for the first time in three days as futures gained
amid optimism that European leaders will make progress on
controlling the regionâ€™s debt crisis.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 28.07 percent at 3:10 p.m. in  New
York , up from 27.68 percent yesterday.  Crude oil for October delivery rose 58 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $96.84 a barrel on the Nymex.  Implied volatility on calls protecting against a 10 percent
rise in futures rose to 30.1 percent as of 3:20 p.m. from 29.4
percent at the same time yesterday. Puts protecting against a 10
percent decline rose to 30.9 from 30.6 percent.  The most active options in electronic trading today were

3:30 p.m. with 2,740 lots trading. October $85 puts were the
second-most active options, with 2,215 lots changing hands as
they declined 6 cents to 23 cents a barrel.  Bullish bets accounted for 54 percent of electronic trading
today. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
