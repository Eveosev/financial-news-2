German two-year  note yields  rose
above zero for the first time in more than five weeks as
speculation the euro-area debt crisis is abating damped demand
for the region’s safest assets.  The yield climbed four basis points to 0.017 percent at
4:20 p.m. London time after being negative since July 12. The
rate fell to a record low of minus 0.097 percent on July 31 and
Aug. 2. The zero percent bond due in June 2014 dropped 0.07, or
70 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,249) face amount, to 99.97.  “We have seen a generalized improvement in risk appetite
since the last European Central Bank meeting, resulting in an
unwinding of safe-haven flows,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-
income strategist at broker RIA Capital Markets in Edinburgh.
“The rise in two-year German yields is another illustration of
this. Much will depend on the outcome of the ECB meeting in
early September.”  A negative yield means investors who hold the security
until it matures will receive less than they paid to buy it.  Yields below zero showed the euro-area economy isn’t
“doing well,”  European Economic  and Monetary Affairs
Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said in a Bloomberg Television interview
on Aug. 14.  German 10-year bunds also declined, with the yield rising
six basis points to 1.57 percent.  German  government bonds  handed investors a loss of 1.2
percent this month through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
