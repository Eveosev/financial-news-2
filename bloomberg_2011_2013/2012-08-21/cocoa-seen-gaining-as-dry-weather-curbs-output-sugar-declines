 Cocoa may rise in  New York  on
speculation dry weather will curb production in West Africa,
supplier of about two-thirds of the world’s crop. Sugar fell.  Ghana ’s western region, the largest growing area of the
second-biggest producer, got 4.5 millimeters (0.2 inch) of rain
in three towns monitored from Aug. 1 to Aug. 10, data from the
Ghana Meteorological Agency showed. That compares with 35.4
millimeters a year earlier. Cocoa has climbed 16 percent this
year in New York on speculation a developing El Nino will bring
more dry weather, curbing supplies.  “The outlook for cocoa heading into 2013 remains a
decidedly bullish one,”  Shawn Hackett , president of Hackett
Financial Advisors Inc., said in a report e-mailed yesterday.
“Persistent dry weather in West Africa has the potential to
crater production potential.”  Cocoa for December delivery was little changed at $2,409 a
metric ton by 6:41 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. Earlier
it rose as much as 0.6 percent to $2,423 a ton. An increase to
$2,500 a ton would signal a  bull market , Hackett said. The beans
were little changed at 1,611 pounds ($2,538) a ton on NYSE Liffe
in London.  Biggest grower  Ivory Coast  had below average rainfall in
the southwestern Soubre region, which produces about 300,000
tons of cocoa a year, according to data from the country’s
National Meteorological Service. It produced 1.36 million tons
this season, according to  Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI) , the Lome,
Togo-based lender.  The next 30 days will be important for crop development,
Hackett said. The 2012-13 cocoa season should have a “small
global deficit,” according to a Aug. 17 report by Ecobank. That
may boost prices in the next few months, it said.  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.4 percent to 20.41
cents a pound in New York. White, or refined, sugar for October
delivery declined 0.7 percent to $562 a ton in London.  Arabica coffee for December delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$1.6515 a pound on ICE. Robusta coffee for November delivery was
little changed at $2,103 a ton NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
