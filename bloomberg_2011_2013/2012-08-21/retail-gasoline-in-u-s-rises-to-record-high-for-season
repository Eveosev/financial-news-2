Retail gasoline in the U.S. rose to
a seasonal high after refinery upsets cut fuel supplies and
crude traded near a three-month high.  The national average price for regular gasoline gained 2.3
cents to $3.744 a gallon this week, and was up from $3.581 a
year ago, the Energy Information Administration said in a
 report  yesterday. That’s the highest level for this season 
since at least 1990, when the agency began collecting prices.  U.S. retail  gasoline  has climbed for seven weeks, advancing
38.8 cents a gallon since July 2, as crude prices gained more
than $12 a barrel and refinery disruptions sent gasoline
inventories to the lowest level for this time of year since
2008, according to EIA data.  “Crude prices are most of it, and gasoline stocks are
still really low,”  David Hackett , the president of Stillwater
Associates in  Irvine ,  California , an independent fuel
consultant, said by telephone yesterday. “I don’t expect any
relief in gasoline prices until after Labor Day” on Sept. 3, he
said.  Advances in wholesale prices for gasoline, corn and wheat
have led a rally in the  Standard & Poor’s GSCI index  of 24 raw
materials from a closing low on June 21, surpassing the 20
percent threshold that signals a  bull market .  Chevron Blaze  Process units at  Chevron Corp. (CVX) ’s 240,000 barrel-a-day
Richmond refinery, the largest in Northern California, were
producing at 60 percent of capacity after an Aug. 6 blaze that
shut the plant’s only crude unit, a person familiar with
operations there said Aug. 8.  Other refineries that have produced below capacity include
 BP Plc (BP/) ’s Whiting, Indiana, plant,  Sunoco Inc. (SUN) ’s Philadelphia
plant,  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s Norco refinery in St. Charles,
 Louisiana , and Sinclair Oil Corp.’s Wyoming plant.  U.S. Gulf Coast and West Coast gasoline prices gained the
most this week, increasing to $3.546 and $4.002 a gallon,
respectively. The Midwest was the only region where prices
dropped, falling 2.7 cents to $3.761 a gallon.  Citgo Petroleum Corp. reported an equipment startup at the
Lemont refinery in Illinois Aug. 7. The 170,500-barrel-a-day
plant shut a fluid catalytic cracker last month and was
scheduled to finish work on the unit by early August.  AAA Prices  Gasoline at the pump  averaged  $3.717 a gallon yesterday, a
second straight daily record,  Michael Green , a spokesman for AAA
in  Washington , said today.  “There is some good news for drivers despite record-high
gas prices,” Green said in an e-mail yesterday. “The national
average price of gas has remained flat in recent days as
refinery issues have stabilized in the Midwest and West Coast.”  Prices in the U.S. East Coast should also drop in a few
weeks as refiners switch out of summer-grade gasoline
production, according to Hackett.  “Refiners can’t make as much gasoline to the summer grade
as they can to fall and winter,” he said. “That’ll increase
supplies in the East and help take the pressure of prices.”  West Texas Intermediate oil for September delivery rose
$1.51 to $97.48 a barrel today on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange today. Prices rose as high as $97.60, the highest level
since May 10.  Nymex gasoline futures for September delivery gained 5.02
cents to $3.081 a gallon. Prices increased 0.33 cent yesterday
on speculation that demand will increase as the U.S. approaches
the Labor Day holiday.  Gasoline Inventories  Motor-gasoline inventories declined for a third week in the
seven days ended Aug. 10, dropping 2.37 million barrels, or 1.2
percent, to 203.7 million, the Energy Department said Aug. 15.
Stockpiles of the fuel probably fell 1 million barrels, or 0.5
percent, to 202.7 million last week, a Bloomberg survey of nine
analysts showed.  Crude supplies  also slipped for the third week, shrinking
3.7 million barrels, or 1 percent, to 366.2 million, the agency
said. They probably climbed for the first time in four weeks in
the seven days ended Aug. 17, gaining 900,000 barrels, as
imports increased and demand slid from a nine-month high,
according to the survey.  Gasoline demand  for the four weeks ended Aug. 10 fell 2.8
percent from a year earlier to 8.91 million barrels a day, the
Energy Department data showed.  AAA, the largest U.S. motoring organization, projected
today that the most Americans since 2008 will travel on vacation
during the Labor Day weekend this year. The number of people
taking trips of 50 miles or more will increase to 33 million
from 32.1 million last year. This year, survey covered the
period from Aug. 30 to Sept. 3.  The Energy Department conducts a telephone survey of about
800 retail gasoline outlets across the U.S. each Monday to post
weekly gasoline prices as of 8 a.m. local time that day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
