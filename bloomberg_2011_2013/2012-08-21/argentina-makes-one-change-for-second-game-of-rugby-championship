Argentina  made one starting change
for its home debut in the Rugby Championship against  South
Africa , which brings two new players into its team.  Argentina coach Santiago Phelan named Martin Rodriguez to
replace Lucas Gonzalez Amorosino at full-back for the Aug. 25
match at the Estadio Malvinas Argentinas in Mendoza, the
Argentine rugby union said on its website. Phelan will name his
reserves bench tomorrow.  Argentina, which joined  Australia ,  New Zealand  and South
Africa in an expanded southern hemisphere rugby championship
this year, opened its campaign with a 27-6 defeat to the
Springboks in  Cape Town  four days ago.  Springboks coach Heyneke Meyer made two changes, and one
position shift, from last week, the South Africa Rugby Union
said on its website.  Adriaan Strauss replaces injured Bismarck du Plessis at
hooker and Jacques Potgieter takes over at blindside flanker, 
with Willem Alberts moving to No. 8 and Keegan Daniel going 
to the bench.  Bryan Habana , the most experienced member of the squad 
with 78 Test caps, will start at wing after passing a fitness 
test. He injured his left ankle in last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
