Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) , the largest
lender based in  Ohio , said the  Federal Reserve  didn’t object to
its capital plan, which includes a 25 percent increase in the
quarterly dividend and share buyback.  The stock repurchase could be as much as 100 million
shares, the Cincinnati-based company said today in a statement.
Fifth Third’s plan included potential share buybacks of as much
as $600 million through the first quarter of next year,
according to the statement. The payout could increase to 10
cents a share this quarter from 8 cents, Fifth Third said.  Fifth Third said in March that the Fed objected to its
proposed dividend increase and some common share buybacks. The
government didn’t object at the time to its redemption of as
much as $1.4 billion in certain trust-preferred securities.  “We believe our plan for capital management and retention
is a balanced and prudent one,” Chief Executive Officer Kevin Kabat, 55, said in the statement.  Fifth Third gained 2.6 percent to $14.77 at 4:29 p.m. in
extended trading in  New York . The shares increased 13 percent
this year through the close of regular trading, compared with a
21 percent advance in the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
