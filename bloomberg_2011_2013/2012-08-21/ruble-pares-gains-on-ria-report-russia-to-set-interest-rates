The ruble trimmed gains against the
dollar in after-hours trading following a RIA Novosti report
that lawmakers of the ruling United Russia party submitted a
bill to let the government determine  interest rates  and the
composition of the currency basket instead of the central bank.  The Russian currency appreciated 0.7 percent versus the
dollar to 31.8025 by 10:51 p.m. in Moscow. The ruble had risen
1.1 percent against the dollar to 31.7159 by the 7 p.m. close of
trading, the biggest advance in two weeks.  “It is strictly the prerogative of the central bank to
determine interest rates and any moves to take this away from
the central bank and put it into the hands of the government
would be a massive step back from all the good things that have
happened with monetary policy,”  Ivan Tchakarov , chief economist
at  Renaissance Capital  in Moscow, said by e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
