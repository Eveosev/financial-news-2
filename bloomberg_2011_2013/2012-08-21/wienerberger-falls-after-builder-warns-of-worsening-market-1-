Wienerberger AG (WIE) , the world’s biggest
brick maker, fell to a three-year low after the company warned
investors that it saw “significant deterioration” in European
building markets.  Wienerberger lost 34.9 cents, or 5.2 percent, to 6.401
euros at the 5:30 p.m. close in Vienna, the lowest since April
9, 2009. The company has lost 8 percent of its market value this
year, while the 23-member STOXX 600 Construction & Materials
index gained 7 percent.  “The macroeconomic environment has deteriorated
significantly in recent months and led to further weakness in
the construction sector throughout  Europe ,” Chief Executive
Officer Heimo Scheuch said in an e-mailed statement. “Industry
experts indicate that the current negative trend in European
residential construction will continue through the end of the
year.”  Wienerberger’s second-quarter net income fell 11 percent to
66.3 million euros ($82.7 million) on revenue of 653.6 million
euros. Analysts expected a profit of 25.7 million euros on sales
of 654.4 million euros, according to six  estimates compiled by
Bloomberg .  To contact the reporter on this story:
