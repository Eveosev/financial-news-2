Jefferies Group Inc. rose the most
in the Standard and Poor’s Midcap Financials Index after  Richard Bove  at Rochdale Securities LLC said the firm’s role in rescuing
 Knight Capital Group Inc. (KCG)  is a reason to buy the stock.  Jefferies climbed 4.7 percent to $14.41 at 10:49 a.m. in
New York as the broader index advanced 0.7 percent. Bove changed
his recommendation to buy from neutral, the analyst said in a
note to clients today.  Jefferies led a group of investors to rescue Knight after
faulty software resulted in a $440 million trading loss on Aug.
1. Firms including Blackstone Group LP and  TD Ameritrade Holding
Corp. (AMTD)  own a controlling stake in the Jersey City, New Jersey-
based market maker. Jefferies also helped lead the U.S. initial
public offering for British soccer club Manchester United Plc.  “The deal was a prestigious one for the firm,” Bove said
of the IPO. “Jefferies is doing a bit better than thought at
present.”  With investors valuing financial firms at or below book
value, the New York-based investment bank is “positioned to
benefit from the expected environment,” Bove said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
