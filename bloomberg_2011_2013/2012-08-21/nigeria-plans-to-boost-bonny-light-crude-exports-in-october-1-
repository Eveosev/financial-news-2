Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to increase Bonny Light daily crude exports for
October by 49 percent from September to 236,613 barrels a day,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The October schedule comprises 10 cargoes totaling 7.335
million barrels, compared with five shipments amounting to 4.75
million for September, the plan showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
