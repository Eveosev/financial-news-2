India ’s rupee strengthened the most
in two weeks on optimism European leaders will agree on measures
to contain their region’s debt crisis at meetings this week.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , the head of
the euro-area group of finance ministers, visits Greece tomorrow
to discuss its debt program. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and
French President  Francois Hollande  meet in Berlin on Aug. 23 and
both are set to talk separately with Greek Prime Minister
Antonis Samaras later in the week. The rupee touched a one-week
high on speculation a scheduled auction of debt-purchase permits
to overseas funds today will help spur fund flows to India.  “The global risk-on phase and ample liquidity have been
aiding the rupee,” Pramit Brahmbhatt, Mumbai-based chief
executive officer of Alpari Financial Services India Pvt. wrote
in a research report today.  The rupee advanced 0.3 percent from Aug. 17 to 55.5750 per
dollar in Mumbai, the biggest gain since Aug. 7, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 55.4550 earlier, the
strongest level since Aug. 13. The market was shut yesterday for
a local holiday. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, fell 15 basis
points, or 0.15 percentage point, to 10.15 percent.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 56.54 per
dollar, compared with 56.75 on Aug. 17, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.49 from 56.71 yesterday.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
