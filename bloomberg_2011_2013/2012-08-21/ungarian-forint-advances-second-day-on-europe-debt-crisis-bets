The forint strengthened for a second
day against the euro to near the strongest in 11 months and
Hungarian  government bonds  gained on speculation the  European
debt crisis  will ease.  The currency of Hungary, the most indebted eastern member
of the European Union, appreciated 0.6 percent to 275.20 per
euro by 4:13 p.m. in Budapest, after hitting 274.46 earlier
today, the strongest since Sept. 7. The government’s notes
maturing in 2015 rallied, cutting yields 16 basis points, or
0.16 percentage point, to 6.875 percent.  European stocks gained and the euro climbed on speculation
the region’s leaders can make progress at meetings on  Greece ’s
debt crisis. Germany’s Bundesbank stepped up its criticism of
the  European Central Bank ’s plan to embark on potentially
“unlimited” government bond purchases.  “Sentiment may be determined by the news from the European
leaders’ meetings and the row between the ECB and the
Bundesbank,” Karoly Bamli, a Budapest-based trader at
Commerzbank AG, and colleagues wrote today on the forint’s
strength.  Hungary  sold a planned 45 billion forint ($204 million) of
three-month Treasury bills at an auction today, at an average
yield of 6.85 percent, matching the cost of borrowing at a sale
on Aug. 7, which was the  lowest  since November for that
maturity.  Hungarian yields have fallen “mostly due to external
factors,” Andras Sovany, a Budapest-based trader at ING Groep
NV, wrote in an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg
today, citing drops in Spanish yields.  The Treasury in  Madrid  sold 4.51 billion euros ($5.6
billion) of bills today, in line with the 4.5 billion euros
sought. The yield for 12-month bills fell to 3.07 percent from
3.918 percent at the last sale on July 17. Yields on 18-month
bills fell to 3.335 percent from 4.242 percent last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
