European (SXXP)  stocks advanced as Spain’s
borrowing costs fell at a debt sale, while investors awaited
bilateral meetings between the leaders of euro-area countries to
gauge their progress in tackling the fiscal crisis.  Mining stocks posted the second-biggest gain of the 19
industry groups in the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index as  Rio Tinto  Group
and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  each added at least 1.5 percent.  Straumann
Holding AG (STMN)  slumped to its lowest price in nine years after
earnings missed analysts’ projections.  The Stoxx 600 climbed 0.4 percent to 272.58 at the close of
trading. The gauge rose to its highest level since July 2011
last week, its 11th consecutive week of gains, as optimism
mounted that the currency zone’s central bankers and politicians
will act to protect lenders and as U.S. consumer sentiment and
leading economic indicators exceeded forecasts.  “We’ve got enough noises coming out of governments and
central banks to suggest they are going to do something; they
just need to figure out how to do it,”  Karen Olney , head of
thematic equity strategy at UBS AG said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. “Asset allocators are saying it’s time to
maybe reduce our underweight in European equities.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was 15
percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Bilateral Meetings  Spain’s borrowing costs fell at an auction of 12- and 18-
month securities today. The yield for bills maturing next August
slipped to 3.07 percent from 3.92 percent at a debt sale on July
17. The yield for the notes maturing in February 2014 slid to
3.34 percent from 4.24 percent.  Luxembourg’s Prime Minister,  Jean-Claude Juncker , head of
the group of euro-area finance ministers, visits Athens tomorrow
to listen to a request by Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras
for a two-year extension to the country’s fiscal-adjustment
program. French President  Francois Hollande  and German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  meet in Berlin on Aug. 23.  National benchmark indexes gained in every western-European
market except  Denmark . The U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index added 0.6
percent. France’s CAC 40 Index climbed 0.9 percent and Germany’s
DAX Index advanced 0.8 percent. Greece’s ASE Index posted the
biggest gain, rising 2.7 percent.  House Sales  In the U.S., house sales and durable-goods orders probably
increased in July, economists said before reports this week.  A report tomorrow may show that sales of  existing
properties  rose to a 4.51 million annual pace from a 4.37
million pace in June,  economists predicted . A release on Aug. 23
will show new house purchases climbed to a 365,000 annual rate
in July from a 350,000 pace in June, according to the  median
forecast  of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  On Aug. 24, a Commerce Department report will show that
durable-goods orders rose 2.5 percent, the most this year,
 economists projected .  China’s central bank today injected 150 billion  yuan  ($23.6
billion) using seven-day contracts and another 70 billion yuan
using 14-day agreements in reverse-repurchase operations
intended to ease a cash crunch, a trader at a primary dealer
required to bid at the auctions said.  That was the biggest one-day injection since the current
round of reverse repos started in late June. The previous high
was 143 billion yuan on July 3.  Mining Companies  Rio Tinto, the  world’s third-largest mining company , gained
2.1 percent to 3,062.5 pence and  BHP Billiton  added 1.5 percent
to 1,980 pence after copper prices climbed in  London . A gauge of
mining stocks listed on  the Stoxx 600  rose 1.7 percent.  Julius Baer Group AG climbed 3.1 percent to 32.36 Swiss
francs after the company said late yesterday it will reduce its
rights offer to 500 million francs ($519 million) from 750
million francs.  Barclays Plc (BARC)  gained 3.2 percent to 197.1 pence after saying
it has started talks with South Africa’s Absa Group Ltd. to
merge their African units. The combination would affect the
banks’ assets in Kenya, Botswana, Zambia, Tanzania and Ghana,
according to a statement. Barclays bought 54 percent of Absa in
2005 for $4.5 billion.  Straumann plunged 13 percent to 108.80 francs, its lowest
price since April 2003. The world’s biggest maker of dental
implants reported  first-half Ebit  of 53.3 million francs,
missing the average analyst estimate of 59.3 million francs. The
company said it does not expect demand to recover in Europe in
the short term.  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN) , the  world’s second-largest maker
of dental implants , slipped 1.1 percent to 9.17 francs.  Telekom Austria AG (TKA)  slid 3.9 percent to 6.45 euros, its
lowest price since May 2001. Banco Espirito Santo SA cut its
price estimate on  the shares , the eighth brokerage to downgrade
its forecast since the Vienna-based phone company lowered its
full-year profit and revenue outlook on Aug. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
