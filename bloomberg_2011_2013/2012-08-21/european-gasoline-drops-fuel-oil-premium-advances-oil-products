Gasoline fell in northwest  Europe  as
 Glencore International Plc (GLEN)  sold on the barge market.  Gasoil gained on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London 
as Brent advanced. Low-sulfur fuel oil’s premium to the high-
sulfur grade widened to the most in more than four months.  Light Products  Gasoline barges for immediate loading in Amsterdam-
Rotterdam-Antwerp traded at $1,090 and $1,094 a metric ton,
according to a survey of brokers and traders monitoring the
Argus Bulletin Board. That’s at the lower end of deals yesterday
from $1,089 to $1,103.  Trafigura Beheer BV purchased 13,000 tons of the 17,000
tons that changed hands. The trades are for Eurobob grade to
which ethanol is added to make finished fuel. Barge deals are
typically for lots of 1,000 tons or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline’s  premium  to Brent declined by 4 cents to $14.26 a
barrel as of 11:08 a.m. local time, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd., a broker in London.  “In Europe we are watching the water levels on the Rhine
which are falling and should accentuate the short-loading of
barges and result in some product backing-up in the ARA
region,”  Olivier Jakob , managing director at Petromatrix GmbH,
said today in a note.  Barge freight rates for gasoline to be transported from the
ARA-region to  Frankfurt  rose to 16.80 euros ($21) a ton
yesterday compared with 15.80 euros on Aug. 15, according to PJK
International BV, a researcher, said by e-mail. A 2,000-ton
barge can only load 1,200 tons of product, Patrick Kulsen,
founder of PJK, said by phone today.  Naphtha’s  discount  to Brent widened to $7.70 a barrel from
$7.26 yesterday, PVM data show.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil for delivery in September rose $3.50, or 0.4
percent, to $982.50 a ton on ICE as of 1:18 p.m. London time.
The more actively traded October contract was at $983 a ton,
putting the market in contango after being at parity for the
past three days.  Contango is a structure where later-dated deliveries are
more expensive than near-term supplies and may signal a future
supply constraint or increase in demand.  Gasoil’s  crack , a measure of refining profitability,
declined to $17.60 a barrel from $17.50 at 4:30 p.m. yesterday.
Brent increased 0.6 percent to $114.37 a barrel.  Residues  Low-sulfur fuel oil’s  premium  to the high-sulfur grade
widened. The price spread was at $64 a ton yesterday, the
highest since April 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
