A diamond bigger than the Koh-i-Noor,
a centerpiece of the British crown jewels, has been unearthed by
Australia’s  Lonrho Mining Ltd. (LOM)  in  Angola .  The 131.5 carat diamond was the bigger of two stones
discovered since the Lulo project near the Cuango river in
northeastern Angola was started two years ago, Perth-based
Lonrho said today in a statement. The other was a 38.3 carat
stone that made it the third-biggest diamond found from the site,
Lonrho said. A carat is a fifth of a gram.  The discovery indicates the potential of the kimberlite
pipe, the volcanic rock containing diamonds, Managing Director
Miles Kennedy said. Angola ranks behind Botswana, Russia, Canada
and  South Africa  as the world’s biggest diamond producer by
value, according to De Beers, the world’s largest diamond
company.  “The latest diamond recoveries underline the world-class
exploration potential of the Lulo concession,” Kennedy said in
the statement. He didn’t give a value estimate for the stone.  The 106-carat Koh-i-Noor (‘Mountain of Light’) diamond,
presented to Queen Victoria in 1850, is now set in the platinum
crown made for the late  Queen Elizabeth , the Queen Mother, for
the 1937 coronation, according to the  website  of the British
Monarchy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
