Texas sold $9.8 billion of one-year
notes at a record low yield for the state of 0.23 percent,
beating last year’s results, Comptroller Susan Combs announced.  JPMorgan Chase (JPM)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  issued winning bids for
the largest portions of the tax-exempt notes, which will let the
second-most-populous U.S. state fund schools until it collects
revenue. The yield of the sale, which ties 2011’s record size,
beat last year’s 0.27 percent.  Texas borrowed at 4 basis points higher than AAA  one-year
munis , halving the difference of last year’s sale.  California’s sale of $10 billion of revenue-anticipation
notes Aug. 16 was 17 basis points to 27 basis points higher than
the benchmark. A basis point is 0.01 of a percentage point.  JPMorgan won about $5.2 billion of the sale and Citigroup
about $2 billion, according to data from the comptroller.  Texas  has sold  short-term notes annually since 1987 to
provide aid to school districts when its fiscal year begins
Sept. 1. The state then reserves  tax revenue  to repay the debt
within 12 months. This year’s issue is to be repaid Aug. 30,
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
