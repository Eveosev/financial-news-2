The won rose for the first time in a
week as overseas investors boosted their holdings of South
Korean stocks and exporters took advantage of recent weakness to
repatriate income at a more favorable  exchange rate .  Government
bonds  advanced.  Foreign investors bought more Korean equities than they
sold for an 11th day, the longest run of net purchases since
January. The won was also supported today as optimism  Europe 
will step up efforts to resolve a regional debt crisis cooled
demand for dollars. The euro advanced for a second day before
Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  visits Greece
tomorrow to discuss the country’s request for an extension to
its fiscal adjustment program.  The won strengthened 0.4 percent to 1,131.15 per dollar in
Seoul, after retreating 0.5 percent in the last four days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied
volatility for the won, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, fell 33 basis points, or 0.33 percentage
point, to 7.04 percent.  “Exporters are settling their deals after recent dollar
gains,” said Kim Dong Young, a currency dealer at state-run
 Industrial Bank of Korea (024110)  in Seoul. “A gain in the euro is also
adding support to the local currency but the market appears to
be largely stuck in a range” between 1,131 and 1,138.  Short-term Debt  South  Korea ’s short-term overseas debt rose the most in
more than a year in the second quarter as banks increased
borrowing and foreign investors purchased Korean bonds amid
Europe’s debt crisis, according to the central bank.  External debt maturing in one year or less gained $5.6
billion in the three months through June to $141.4 billion, the
 Bank of Korea  said in a statement today. Long-term external debt
rose to $277.2 billion.  The yield on South Korea’s 3.5 percent bonds due March 2017
declined three basis points to 3.02 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. Three-year debt futures rose 0.16 to 105.80 and the
one-year interest-rate swap fell four basis points to 2.93
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
