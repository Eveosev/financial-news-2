Russia’s Svetlana Kuznetsova, the
2004 U.S. Open champion, heads a group of players who joined
 Rafael Nadal  in withdrawing from the final major tournament of
the tennis season.  Kuznetsova, 27, who also won the 2009 French Open, was 48th
in the latest WTA Tour rankings. Also withdrawing from the
women’s draw are top-20 players Kaia Kanepi of Estonia and
 Flavia Pennetta  of Italy, and Elena Baltacha of Britain.  The U.S. Tennis Association didn’t give a reason for the
withdrawals ahead of the  U.S. Open , which begins Aug. 27 at the
National Tennis Center in New York.  Nadal, an 11-time Grand Slam winner, said last week that
injuries would prevent him from playing in the U.S. Open, which
he won in 2010. France’s Gael Monfils, Argentina’s Juan Ignacio Chela and  Spain ’s Juan Carlos Ferrero also withdrew from the
men’s draw, the USTA said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
