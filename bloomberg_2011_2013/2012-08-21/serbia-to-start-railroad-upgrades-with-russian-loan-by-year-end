Serbia’s first railroad project
funded by an $800 million loan from  Russia  is to begin in the
fourth quarter after years of negotiations, the state-owned rail
company said.  Rebuilding a 15-kilometer (9-mile) stretch from Belgrade to
Pancevo will be the first among five projects for which Russia
pledged support, Zeleznice Srbije said in an e-mailed statement.
The financing was initially agreed on by the two country’s
presidents in 2009.  Contracts for reconstruction of six sections totaling 111
kilometers along Serbia’s main north-south route, and for
purchasing Russian-made rolling stock will be signed by the end
of the year, the company said, after a meeting in Belgrade with
Alexander Saltanovi, Vice-President of Russian Railways, or RZD.  Under a framework agreement signed in Moscow in March,
Zarubezhstroytechnology, an engineering and construction unit of
RZD, will be the main contractor, while 30 percent of materials
and work will be supplied by Serbian companies.  The loan will cover 85 percent of the cost of all five
projects, which also include building a 68-kilometer railway
between Valjevo and Loznica in western  Serbia , and the overhaul
of the rail link between Belgrade and Montenegro.  To contact the reporter on this story:
