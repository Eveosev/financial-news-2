Kenya ’s shilling strengthened
against the dollar as the central bank removed money from the
market through repurchase agreements.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
as much as 0.4 percent to 83.70 per dollar, the highest on a
closing basis since Aug. 13, as of 2:15 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital.  The shilling is expected to strengthen on greater dollar
inflows from the agricultural sector and frequent central bank
intervention to tighten liquidity, Nairobi-based  NIC Bank Ltd. (NICB) 
said in an e-mailed note today.  “For the day we expect the shilling to trade with a
stronger tone against the dollar and within a range of 83.80 and
84.50,” the bank said.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 1.5 billion shillings ($17.9
million) of seven-day  repurchase agreements  at a weighted
average yield of 9.208 percent, a central bank official, who
asked not to be identified in line with policy, said.  The bank also accepted 5.3 billion shillings for term
auction deposits, the official said today by telephone from
Nairobi. The 14-day term auction deposit attracted a yield of
9.981 percent, the 21-day issue came in at 9.978 percent and the
28-day note carried a rate of 10.182 percent, he said.  The Tanzanian shilling gained 0.7 percent to 1,569.65 a
dollar, the most since Dec. 28 on a closing basis, while
 Uganda ’s shilling strengthened 0.2 percent to 2,488.70 versus
the U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
