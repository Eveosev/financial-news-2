The pound fell to the lowest level
in almost two weeks against the euro as reports showing Britain
unexpectedly posted a  budget deficit  in July and manufacturing
orders declined in August added to signs the economy is slowing.  Sterling slipped the most in three weeks against the
European common currency. The budget shortfall, which excludes
government support for banks, was 557 million pounds ($880
million) compared with a surplus of 2.84 billion pounds a year
earlier, the  Office for National Statistics  said in  London . The
Debt Management Office sold 1.25 billion pounds of inflation-
linked bonds due March 2029 at a so-called real yield of minus
0.025 percent.  “The pound took a bit of a kick in the shins when the
numbers came out,” said Lee McDarby, head of dealing on the
corporate and institutional treasury desk at Investec Bank Plc
in London, referring to the manufacturing data. Britain is
“hidden behind by what’s been going on in  Europe ” and losses
by the currency will be muted, he said.  Sterling fell 0.5 percent to 79.02 pence against the euro
at 4:18 p.m. London time, after depreciating to 79.08 pence, the
weakest level since Aug. 8. The pound gained 0.5 percent to
$1.5795.  Britain’s currency has lost 1 percent in the past month,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-market currencies. The dollar fell 2.2 percent and
the euro gained 0.7 percent over the period.  Factory Orders  The median of 17 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey was
for the country to record a surplus of 2.2 billion pounds. The
deficit was partly due to the closing of the Elgin gas facility
in the  North Sea , the statistics office said.  An index of  factory orders  declined to minus 21 in August
from minus 6 in July, the  Confederation of British Industry  said
in London in a report today. That’s the lowest since December.  The 10-year gilt yield rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 1.71 percent. The rate climbed to 1.73
percent yesterday, the highest level since July 5. The 4 percent
bond maturing March 2022 fell 0.39, or 3.90 pounds per 1,000-
pound face amount, to 120.07.  Investors bid for 1.84 times the amount of inflation-linked
bonds allotted, compared with a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.83 at a
previous auction of the securities on June 26, which were sold
at a yield of minus 0.108 percent.  U.K. government bonds have lost 1.3 percent this month,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds,
perceived to be among the safest debt securities in the euro
area, have declined 1.2 percent this month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
