Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K.-based oil and gas
company focused on Nigeria and  Iraq , more than doubled its East
African resource estimate to 5.8 billion barrels of oil
equivalent after new analysis and seismic examinations.  The company plans to drill exploration wells in  Kenya ,
Ethiopia,  Tanzania  and Madagascar in the next 18 months.  In Kenya’s Blocks L17 and L18, the resources estimate was
raised to 1.1 billion barrels from 94 million barrels, while the
company is carrying out “3D seismic offshore” exploration
works, Chief Executive Officer Osman Shahenshah said.  Marathon Oil Corp. is the latest entrant into East African
exploration, while Total SA, Eni Spa, Tullow Oil Plc are among
those expanding operations in the region. Shahenshah in March
forecast more explorers would secure fields in  East Africa 
following the first onshore crude oil discovery in Kenya.  “From time to time companies approach us indicating
interest to participate with us in some fields,” he said in an
interview. “There is more and more interest in East Africa.”  The company more than tripled output to a daily net 41,251
barrels of oil equivalent in the first half from last year.
Sales rose almost fivefold to $771.7 million because of the
higher output, London-based Afren said today in a statement.  While second-quarter production was curbed by maintenance,
Shahenshah reiterated full-year guidance of 42,000 to 46,000
barrels a day. Afren has begun output at the Barda Rash field in
 Iraqi Kurdistan , with the first well yielding more than 6,000
barrels oil a day. Output will rise to as much as 15,000 barrels
with wells brought on stream by the year-end, Shahenshah said.  The company plans to produce 35,000 barrels a day in
Kurdistan next year, with extraction expected to rise to 125,000
barrels of oil a day in 2017. “That’s what we call the base
case, there is obviously upside from there,” the CEO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
