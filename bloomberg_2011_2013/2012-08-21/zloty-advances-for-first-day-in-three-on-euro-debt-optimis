Poland ’s zloty snapped two days of
declines on optimism euro-region leaders will make progress on
Greece’s debt crisis at meetings this week, boosting appetite
for riskier emerging-market assets.  The zloty strengthened 0.2 percent to 4.0617 per euro as of
5:14 p.m. in Warsaw. Yields on 10-year notes fell less than 1
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 4.47 percent.  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker , who heads
the group of euro-area finance ministers, visits Greece tomorrow
and will discuss a request by Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras for a two-year extension to the indebted nation’s fiscal
adjustment program. Samaras travels to Berlin and Paris on Aug.
24 and 25 after French President Francois Hollande and German
Chancellor Angela Merkel meet in the German capital on Aug. 23.
The euro area is Poland’s biggest trading partner.  The zloty should appreciate on “hopes that the talks
scheduled by European leaders for the latter part of the week
will yield effective tools to fight the crisis,”  Grzegorz Maliszewski , chief economist at  Bank Millennium SA (MIL) , wrote in an
e-mailed note to clients today. The currency may “test” the
4.0480 per euro level, according to Millennium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
