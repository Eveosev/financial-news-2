Doro AB (DORO) , a Swedish maker of phones
and answering machines, fell the most in more than two years
after its second-quarter profit tumbled and Pareto Ohman
recommended investors to sell the stock.  Shares in the Lund, Sweden-based company plummeted as much
as 15 percent and were down 14 percent at 24.3 kronor, the
biggest fall since May 2010, at 12:07 p.m. in Stockholm trading.  Sales during the period was affected by a stock reduction
in  Canada  where customers are waiting for newer models and by
increased competition from low-priced products in some European
markets. Increasing competition from Asian vendors is making the
market more difficult for Doro, Helena Nordman-Knutson, a
Stockholm-based analyst at Pareto Ohman, said in a note today.  “Even if Doro is likely to turn the sales trend into
growth in 2013, the competition is eating market share with
strong price pressure in  Europe ,” she said. “We believe that
Doro will have to adjust its long-term sales growth goal of 20
percent as we move into 2013.”  Net income during the second quarter fell 24 percent to 6
million kronor ($903,587), while sales slipped 5.1 percent to
156.5 million kronor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
