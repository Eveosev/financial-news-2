Vietnam ’s five-year bonds fell,
pushing yields to the highest level in almost a week, as an
increase in money-market rates made it costlier to buy debt with
borrowed funds. The dong was unchanged.  The  overnight interbank deposit rate  rose 47 basis points
today to 3.68 percent, the highest level since July 24,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure rose 224
basis points in the past week. The State Treasury will offer 2
trillion dong ($96 million) each of two- , three- and five-year
debt at an auction today, according to an Aug. 15 statement on
the  Hanoi Stock Exchange  website.  “Money-market rates increased today, and the  bond market 
had the same movement,” said Tran Kieu Hung, a Hanoi-based bond
trader at Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam.  The yield on benchmark five-year bonds rose 1 basis point,
or 0.01 percentage point, to 9.62 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong traded at 20,845 per dollar as of 5:13 p.m. in
Hanoi, unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
