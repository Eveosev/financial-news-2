Iran  will start within three weeks a
new gasoline production unit at the Shazand refinery which will
double the plant’s output to 16 million liters a day, the state-
run Mehr news agency reported.  The country’s total gasoline production capacity is due to
rise to 70 million liters a day by the end of the Iranian
calendar year on March 19, as more developments are put into
operation, the agency said, citing Alireza Zeighami, the deputy
oil minister and managing director of the National Iranian Oil
Refining and Distribution Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
