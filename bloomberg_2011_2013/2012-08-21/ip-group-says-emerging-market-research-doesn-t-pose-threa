IP Group Plc (IPO) , which develops new
businesses based on discoveries at U.K. universities, said it
isn’t threatened by innovation at research institutions in
 emerging markets .  “It will be a long time before emerging nations can
replicate a Harvard or an Oxford,” Chief Investment Officer
Mike Townend said in a phone interview. “Our intellectual
property in the U.K., and clearly in the U.S. as well, has
extremely strong barriers to entry.”  IP Group’s adjusted pretax profit was 31.2 million pounds
($49.2 million) in the six months through June, compared with a
1.1 million-pound loss a year earlier, the London-based company
said in a statement today. The value of its 10 largest holdings
rose to 132.2 million pounds at the end of June from 84.4
million pounds a year earlier.  IP Group  investments  include medical, chemical and
renewable energy technologies, ranging from polymers for
removable, degradable chewing gum produced by  Revolymer Plc (REVO)  to
systems for water-saving washing machines from Xeros Ltd.  IP Group shares rose as much as 4.7 percent in  London  and
were up 2.9 percent at 127.8 pence as of 1:06 p.m. The stock has
advanced 63 percent this year, giving the company a market value
of 467.4 million pounds. The shares have retreated from a five-
year high of 155 pence at the close of trading on July 6.  IP Group works with institutions including University of
Oxford,  King’s College London  and University of Southampton,
according to the company’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
