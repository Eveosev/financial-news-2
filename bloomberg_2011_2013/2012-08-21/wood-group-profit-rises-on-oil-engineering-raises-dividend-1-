John Wood Group Plc (WG/) , a U.K. oil
services provider active in Africa and the  Middle East , said
profit gained 56 percent in the first half.  Profit before tax and exceptional items climbed to $160
million from $102.7 million a year earlier, the Aberdeen,
Scotland-based company said in a statement. It raised the
interim dividend by 46 percent to 5.7 cents a share.  The company slipped 0.9 percent to 828 pence in London,
bringing the stock’s gains this year to 29 percent.  “The shares have outperformed strongly because of the
engineering division and it may be people were expecting further
good news,” Chief Executive Officer Allister Langlands said on
a conference call. “Overall we’re expecting full-year
performance in line with expectations.”  The engineering unit’s earnings before interest, taxes and
amortization will gain about 30 percent this year compared with
2011, Wood Group said June 29. Concerns the world economy will
falter haven’t affected Wood Group’s business, Langlands said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
