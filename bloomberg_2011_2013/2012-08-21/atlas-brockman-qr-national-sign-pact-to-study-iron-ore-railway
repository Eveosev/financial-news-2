Atlas Iron Ltd. (AGO) , an Australian iron
ore producer, haulage company  QR National Ltd. (QRN)  and Brockman
Resources Ltd. agreed to study building new rail and port
capacity in Western Australia’s Pilbara region.  The companies signed an agreement to share costs and
resources for the study that is expected to be completed by the
end of the year, Hong Kong-based  Wah Nam International Holdings
Ltd. (159) , which owns Brockman, said in a statement today. Further
agreement on project development may follow, it said.  Atlas Iron and Brockman need port and rail capacity to haul
iron ore from their Pilbara mines as they seek to boost exports
to China, the world’s biggest consumer of the steelmaking
material. Today’s agreement came after an initial accord was
signed in April between Atlas and QR National for an evaluation
to build a new railroad to  Port Hedland , the gateway to Asia
from the ore-rich region in northwestern Australia.  Atlas Iron and Brockman are also part of the North West
Infrastructure joint venture studying port solutions in the
Pilbara. Atlas intends to more than triple annual output to 46
million metric tons by 2017. Brockman owns the Marillana iron
ore project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
