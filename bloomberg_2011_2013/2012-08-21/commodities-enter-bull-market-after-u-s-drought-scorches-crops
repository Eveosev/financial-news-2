Commodities entered a  bull market ,
gaining 21 percent from a June low, as grain prices surged
following the most-severe U.S. drought in half a century.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
rose 0.9 percent to settle at 675.55 at 4 p.m. in New York. The
gauge has jumped 21 percent from this year’s lowest close of 559
on June 21. A gain of more than 20 percent is the common
definition of a bull market.  Soybean futures rose to a record today in Chicago, and corn
has soared 66 percent since mid-June. The  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  has declared almost 1,600 counties in 32 states as
natural-disaster areas after the drought seared millions of
acres of pasture and cropland.  “The grains have been the strongest-performing subsector
in commodities the past few months, and that has purely been
driven by supply-side considerations and the U.S. drought in
particular,” said  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , a London-based
analyst at Barclays Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
