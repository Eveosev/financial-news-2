Colombia’s stock exchange is
analyzing the cause of today’s failure in its Electronic Access
Service, or SAE, the bourse said in an e-mailed statement.  The stock exchange was introducing a new version of its X-
Stream trading platform this morning when the failure took
place, the statement said.  The stock exchange suspended the data service to avoid
“trading risks” for users, according to the statement.  The statement did not say when the system will be
functioning again. The market remained open all day.  The IGBC index declined 0.3 percent to 14,204.05.  To contact the reporter on this story:
