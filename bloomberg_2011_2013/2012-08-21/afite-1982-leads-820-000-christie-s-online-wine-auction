A case of 1982 Chateau Lafite helped
Christie’s International raise $819,715 in its first exclusively
online wine auction yesterday.  The 1982, considered one of the best vintages of last
century, was the most expensive lot fetching $42,350, including
a 21 percent commission known as buyer’s premium.  The sale was the first foray into stand-alone  online  wine
auctions by Christie’s, which until recently only allowed
internet bidders to participate in live auctions. The two-week
sale sourced from three private collections ended on August 20,
with 88 percent of the 301 lots sold. The pre-sale estimates
excluding premium ranged from $750,000 to $1 million.  The auction represents a push by Christie’s to gain market
share in high-end sales. It also plans to sell watches, prints
and fine art in all-online sales with the next internet-only
wine sale starting on Oct. 16.  One quarter of the online clients were first-time buyers
with Christie’s while many others, including an Asian client who
bought the top lot, were existing customers buying wine for the
first time, Per Holmberg, head of wine at Christie’s  New York 
said.  The 444 registered bidders came from 29 countries,
including Latvia and  Indonesia . Brazilian bidders were also very
active, mirroring the trend in other Christie’s sales, Holmberg
said.  Chateau Petrus  The sale highlights included an original wooden case
containing six bottles of 2000  Chateau Petrus  that fetched
$26,620, exceeding the $20,000 high estimate.  Two lots of 2000 Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, each comprised
of a dozen bottles, went for $16,940, surpassing the high
estimates of $15,000. Twelve bottles of 1982  Chateau Latour 
fetched $21,780, surpassing the high estimate of $18,000.  Casualties included 2000 Chateau Lafite in an original
wooden case, estimated between $20,000 and $30,000 and a case of
1989 Chateau Haut-Brion, estimated between $12,000 and $18,000,
which failed to sell.  “This sale was heavy on Bordeaux,” said Holmberg. “Next
time we are going to mix it up. We are consciously trying to get
more Burgundy.”  Christie’s online sales generated $130 million in 2011, a
46 percent increase in that revenue stream since 2008, the first
full year Christie’s tracked its online auction revenue. Last
year 29 percent of bids received globally came through its
online platform.  Wine was the most popular online category, accounting for
21 percent of Christie’s global wine sales last year. Watches
were a close second.  Christie’s main rival  Sotheby’s (BID)  does not yet offer online-
only auctions.  Muse highlights include  John Mariani  on wine and Mark Beech
on theater.  To contact the reporter on this story:
