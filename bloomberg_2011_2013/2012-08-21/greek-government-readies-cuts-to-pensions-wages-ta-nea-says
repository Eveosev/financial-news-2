Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras yesterday presented a 14 billion-euro package of
spending cuts to Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, Athens-based
newspaper Ta Nea reported, without citing anyone.   The package, which includes cuts of between 2 percent and
20 percent to pensions and as much as a 35 percent reduction in
pay for employees in state-run companies, will be finalised in
talks with the countryâ€™s creditors by Sept. 14, Ta Nea said. The
plan includes additional cuts to ensure the government meets the
goal of 11.6 billion euros in savings, as reduced wages and
pensions will lead to lower tax revenue and payments to social
security funds.   Stournaras has prepared alternative measures totalling 1
billion euros in case some options are rejected, Ta Nea said.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
