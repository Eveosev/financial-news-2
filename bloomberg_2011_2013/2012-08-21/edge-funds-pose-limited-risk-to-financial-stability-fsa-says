Hedge funds  pose a limited risk to
the stability of the financial system, according to a survey by
the U.K.’s  Financial Services Authority .  Funds have a “strong ability to manage the liquidity of
their assets and liabilities,” the FSA said in a  report 
published on its website today. The regulator collected data on
funds with a total of more than $380 billion under management.  Banks and other counterparties of hedge funds have
“increased margining requirements and tightened other
conditions on their exposures to hedge funds since the financial
crisis,” according to the FSA report.  Hedge funds and private-equity firms have come under
scrutiny from lawmakers who said they were partly to blame for
the economic turmoil that followed the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. The European Union has approved measures
to require hedge-fund managers to restrict bonuses and increase
disclosure to regulators.  The hedge funds surveyed reduced their trading of interest
rate derivatives to 2.7 percent of the global market as of March
2012, compared with 4.7 percent in 2010, according to the
report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
