India’s bonds dropped, pushing
 yields  toward a two-week high, as a government report showed the
pace of consumer-price gains held near 10 percent.  The consumer-price  index  rose 9.86 percent from a year
earlier in July, compared with a revised 9.93 percent gain in
June, the  Central Statistical Office  said in New Delhi today.
 Reserve Bank  of India Governor Subir Gokarn said on Aug. 19 that
inflation is currently the main threat to  India’s economy .  “The inflation number remains too high for comfort,”
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong
Kong said in a research note today. “The reading will make it
more difficult for the  Reserve Bank of India  to cut rates.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 rose one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.25 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. It
touched 8.26 percent on Aug. 16, the highest level since Aug. 3.  India can only consider cutting  interest rates  once
inflation shows “sustainable signs of moving down,”  Gokarn
said at a conference in Goa. The central bank refrained from
lowering borrowing costs in July, after reducing the repurchase
 rate  by 50 basis points to 8 percent in April.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose three basis
points to 7.84 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
