Kenya ’s government collected 161
billion shillings ($1.61 billion) of revenue in the fiscal first
quarter, up 15 percent from the same period a year earlier, the
Kenya Revenue Authority said.  The East African nation is expected to receive 186.6
billion shillings in the second quarter through December, though
collections may be curbed by economic “turbulence,” the
Nairobi-based authority said in an e-mailed statement today. The
government is targeting revenue of 733.4 billion shillings in
the 12 months through June 2012, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
