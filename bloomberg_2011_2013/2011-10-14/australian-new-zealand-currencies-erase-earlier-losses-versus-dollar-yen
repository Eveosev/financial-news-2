The Australian and New Zealand
currencies erased earlier losses versus their U.S. and Japanese
counterparts.  Australia â€™s dollar was little changed from yesterday at
$1.0194 at 3:20 p.m. in Sydney after earlier dropping as much as
0.5 percent. It bought 78.40 yen from 78.37, trimming an earlier
decline of 0.4 percent.  The so-called kiwi rose 0.1 percent to 79.64 U.S. cents and
61.22 yen. It previously weakened as much as 0.6 percent against
both the yen and the dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
