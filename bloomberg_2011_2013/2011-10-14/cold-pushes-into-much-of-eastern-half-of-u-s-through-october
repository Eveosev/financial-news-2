Cool weather will spread across the
Midwest, the East Coast and U.S. South next week, possibly
bringing an increase in heating demand, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of the Commodity Weather Group LLC.  Lows in the 30s Fahrenheit (minus 1 to 3.8 Celsius) are
possible in the Midwest, with 30s to 40s in the East and 40s in
the South, Rogers said in a note to clients today.  “The cool air chunk dropping into the Midwest, South, and
East next week is looking stronger with a brief burst of ‘much-
below’ temperatures,” said Rogers, based in Bethesda,  Maryland .
“The big-picture pattern still looks to lean cool in the East
through the end of the month.”  Traders use long-range temperature predictions to gauge
energy use and market fluctuations. Hot or cold weather can
increase demand for heating and cooling, and power plants use
about 30 percent of the nation’s gas supplies, according to
Energy Department data.  According to Rogers’s 6- to 10-day and 11- to 15-day
outlooks, the cooler weather should remain over the eastern U.S.
from Oct. 19 to Oct. 28. At the same time, the  Rocky Mountains 
and  Southern California  may experience warmer-than-normal
weather, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
