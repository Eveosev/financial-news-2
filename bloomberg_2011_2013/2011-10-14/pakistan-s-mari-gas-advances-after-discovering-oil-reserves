Mari Gas Co., a Pakistani energy
explorer, jumped almost by its daily limit of 5 percent in
Karachi after saying it discovered oil reserves at a block.  Shares of the company, based in Islamabad, were set for
their biggest gain in a month, rising to 94.87 rupees at 11:45
a.m. local time.  The company struck oil at a depth of 5,350 meters (17,600
feet) in Karak on the border of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab
provinces, it said in a filing to the stock exchange today.
Tests indicated output of 1,700 barrels a day.  Mari Gas is partly owned by Mol  Pakistan  Oil & Gas BV, a
unit of Mol Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest refiner. Mol Pakistan has a
40 percent share in the Karak block, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
