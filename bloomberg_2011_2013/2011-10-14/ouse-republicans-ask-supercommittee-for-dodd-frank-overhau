Republicans on the U.S. House
Financial Services Committee urged a congressional
supercommittee to consider overhauling the Dodd-Frank Act as
part of an effort to reduce the federal  budget deficit .  “Some 15 months after Dodd-Frank was enacted, many small
businesses are starved for customers and credit; unemployment
has soared to more than 9 percent; and for far too many American
families, economic security seems further away than ever,”
Representative  Spencer Bachus , the Alabama Republican who leads
the Financial Services panel, wrote in an 11-page letter to
Representative  Jeb Hensarling  and Senator  Patty Murray , the co-
chairmen of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.  Attached to the letter is an inventory of 24 measures aimed
at reshaping, and  in some cases repealing, large swaths of
Dodd-Frank, the financial-regulation overhaul enacted last year.
The measures include changes to the structure and funding of the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an expansion of exemptions
from new derivatives regulations and repeals of the Office of
Financial Research and requirements that private-equity firms
register with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
