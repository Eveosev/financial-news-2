Zimbabwe’s  Cairns Holdings Ltd. (CAIRNS)  has
temporarily closed its Blue Ribbon Industries (Pvt) Ltd. corn
and flour mills due to “logistical” problems, the state-
controlled  Herald  said, citing Chief Executive Mike Manga.  Blue Ribbon has debts of about $2 million and was operating
at 20 percent capacity before the shut-down, the Harare-based
Herald said on its website. The company also owns animal feed
plants and bakeries, said the Herald.  To contact the reporter on this story:
