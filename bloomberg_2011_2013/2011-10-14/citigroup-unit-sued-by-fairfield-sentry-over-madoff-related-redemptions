A  Citigroup Inc. (C)  unit was sued by
liquidators for Fairfield Sentry Ltd. who are seeking to take
back money withdrawn from the largest feeder fund for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Inc.  Citigroup Global Markets Ltd. received $130 million in so-
called redemption payments from Sentry from Oct. 14, 2005, to
Nov. 19, 2008, according to a complaint filed yesterday by the
liquidators in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  New York .  The liquidators accuse the Citigroup unit and unidentified
investors in the Sentry funds of unjust enrichment and seek
return of the payments plus interest.  “We believe this suit is without merit,” Danielle Romero- Apsilos, a spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, said in an
e-mailed statement.  The liquidators filed similar complaints yesterday against
Fullerton Capital Pte Ltd. and Bankmed Suisse SA.  The case is In re Fairfield Sentry Ltd., 10-13164,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
