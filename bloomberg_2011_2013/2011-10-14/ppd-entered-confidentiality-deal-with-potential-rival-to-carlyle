Pharmaceutical Product Development
Inc. (PPDI) , a clinical research firm, entered a confidentiality
agreement with a potential rival to the proposed $3.9 billion
takeover by  Carlyle Group  and Hellman & Friedman LLC.  The agreement, made during a go-shop period in which PPD
was permitted to pursue other buyers through Nov. 1, hadn’t led
to a proposal as of yesterday, the Wilmington, North Carolina-
based company said today in a regulatory filing.  Private-equity firms Carlyle and Hellman & Friedman agreed
earlier this month to pay $33.25 a share for PPD, falling short
of the $34 to $35 the company had been seeking, according to a
person with direct knowledge of the negotiations, who asked not
to be named because the talks were private.  “The likelihood of a higher bid is low, but probably not
as low as when the deal was originally announced given some
improvement in the credit markets over the past two weeks,”  Tim Evans , an analyst with  Wells Fargo Securities LLC , wrote today
in a research note.  Morgan Stanley, PPD’s financial adviser, had reached out to
nine “strategic parties” and 13 “financial” ones as of
yesterday, PPD said in the filing. The companies contacted
included PPD competitors that had earlier expressed interest,
PPD said.  PPD rose 1.8 percent to $33.05 at 4 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
