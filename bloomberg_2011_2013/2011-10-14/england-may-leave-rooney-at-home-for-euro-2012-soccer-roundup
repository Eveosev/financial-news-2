stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the Web.  Rooney Dilemma  England coach Fabio Capello is considering leaving Wayne Rooney at home for the European Championship, the  Daily Mail

yesterday and will miss the group stage of next year’s
tournament, the Mail said.  Tevez Refusal  Carlos Tevez  refused to apologize to Manchester City coach
 Roberto Mancini  after being summoned to his house on Wednesday

answer charges he breached his contract by refusing to enter
as a substitute at  Bayern Munich  on Sept. 27.  Tevez trained on his own yesterday,  the Sun  reported.  Sunderland Scout  Sunderland is the latest team to monitor PSV Eindhoven

million) to sign, is also being followed by Liverpool and West
Bromwich Albion, the Mail said.  Dalglish Doubt  Liverpool owner John Henry said initially he wasn’t
convinced  Kenny Dalglish  should become the team’s manager,  the
