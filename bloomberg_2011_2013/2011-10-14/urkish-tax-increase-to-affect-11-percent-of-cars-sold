Turkish tax increases on new cars
with engines over 1.6 liters will affect the price of 11 percent
of cars sold, according to sales data for the first nine months
of the year.  About 89 percent of new cars sold in the period, or 366,526
units, had engines of less than 1.6 liters, the  Automotive
Distributors’ Association ’s press office said by telephone today
from Istanbul.  Turkey  announced the tax rise yesterday to help narrow the
current account deficit and increase budget revenue. Turks
either buy imported cars or obtain them from the units of
companies such as  Fiat SpA (F)  and  Renault SA (RNO) , which import nearly
all parts and assemble the cars in Turkey.  The increases in consumption taxes on cars, tobacco and
alcohol were designed to reduce the current account deficit and
will avoid penalizing production of locally-made vehicles,
Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek said yesterday. The tax rises are
aimed at supporting budget revenue, Trade Minister Zafer
Caglayan said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
