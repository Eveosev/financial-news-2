The  European Central Bank  bought
Spanish government bonds today, according to two people with
direct knowledge of the transactions.  The Frankfurt-based central bank also bought Italian
securities, said two people, who declined to be identified
because the transactions are confidential.  A spokesman for the ECB declined to comment on the ECBâ€™s
market activities when contacted by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
