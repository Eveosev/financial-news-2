The Bank of New York Mellon  China 
ADR Index, which tracks American depositary receipts, gained 1.6
percent to a three-week high of 375.73. The New York Stock
Exchange Arca China Index rose 2 percent to 222.72. The  Shanghai

prices are as of the close of trading.  China Petroleum and Chemical Corp. (SNP US), the country’s
biggest refiner, known as Sinopec, advanced 2.6 percent, the
most in eight sessions, to $94.84. The company will pay a lower
resources tax rate of 3.7 percent because of government tax
breaks for production at old oilfields, Chairman Fu Chengyu said
in  Hong Kong  today. China will impose a nationwide oil and gas
tax at a rate of 5 to 10 percent of sales starting next month.  China Life Insurance Co. (LFC US), the nation’s biggest
insurer, rose for a fifth straight day, climbing 0.1 percent to
$39.66, the highest price since Aug. 23. The insurer and its
parent company reduced their combined stake in Beijing Capital
Development Co. to 5.23 percent from 10.44 percent, according to
a statement to Shanghai’s stock exchange today.  China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (CHU US), the nation’s
second-largest mobile-phone carrier, sank 4.2 percent to $19.12,
the lowest price since Aug. 24. The company will lower monthly
fees on some new contracts for Apple’s iPhone starting Oct. 16,
Ming Pao Daily reported, without saying how it obtained the
information.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. (YZC US), China’s fourth-largest
producer, jumped 6.5 percent to a one-month high of $25.84.
China’s coal prices may rise this quarter as inventories at
loading stations on the Daqi Railway, which account for a third
of the nation’s coal deliveries by rail, are “extremely low or
absent,”  Helen Lau , a Hong Kong-based analyst at UOB-Kay Hian
Ltd., said in an e-mailed note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
