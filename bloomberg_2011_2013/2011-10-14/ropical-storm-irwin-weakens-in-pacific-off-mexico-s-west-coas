Irwin, once a hurricane, weakened
slightly as it drifted over Pacific waters west of  Mexico  on a
track that will keep the tropical storm away from land the rest
of the week, the  National Hurricane Center  said.  Irwin’s top winds fell to 40 miles (64 kilometers) per hour
from 45 mph as the system churned about 165 miles west of
Manzanillo, Mexico, according to a center advisory at 11 a.m.
New York Time advisory. The storm is moving south at 3 mph.  The NHC also is tracking two systems in the Atlantic. One
is in the Caribbean off the Yucatan Peninsula and  Honduras  and
the second is about 350 miles west of  Bermuda . Each has about a
20 percent chance of becoming larger storms in the next two
days.  To contact the reporters on this story:
