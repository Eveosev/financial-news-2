The A$575 million ($586 million)
acquisition loan backing Bain Capital LLCâ€™s purchase of MYOB
Ltd. is expected to be completed next week after banks join in
general syndication, according to a person familiar with the
matter.  The facility pays general syndication all-in rates that
include margin and fees of about 475 basis points to 490 basis
points over the bank bill swap rate, said a second person
familiar with the matter.  Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Holding Plc, Morgan Stanley, Nomura
Holdings Inc. and UBS AG were hired by Boston-based Bain to
arrange and underwrite the facility. Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd., Credit Agricole CIB, Lloyds Banking Group
Plc, Natixis, Macquarie Group Ltd., National Australia Bank Ltd.
and Westpac Banking Corp. joined the loan prior to general
syndication. Senior lenders funded the deal in September, one of
the people said today.  Bain is buying a majority stake in Melbourne-based business
management software-maker MYOB from buyout firms Archer Capital
and HarbourVest Partners LLC, the companies said in an e-mailed
statement Aug. 21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
