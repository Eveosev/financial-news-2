Texas Governor Rick Perry said that
as president, he would issue a series of executive orders that
would open  Alaska ’s “abundant” energy resources, including the
Arctic Natural Wildlife Refuge and offshore natural gas fields.  He made that statement as he unveiled an energy plan that
he said would “kick-start economic growth” and create as many
as 1.2 million jobs.  Speaking at a U.S. Steel Co. plant in West Mifflin,
 Pennsylvania , near Pittsburgh, the Texas governor said energy
resources in the U.S. could be tapped “if environmental
bureaucrats are told to stand down.” President  Barack Obama  and
the “overrreaching” Environmental Protection Agency won’t
allow development of resources on government lands, he said.  Perry, who is seeking the Republican presidential
nomination, said he would announce his full economic plan,
including tax and entitlement programs, in the coming days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
