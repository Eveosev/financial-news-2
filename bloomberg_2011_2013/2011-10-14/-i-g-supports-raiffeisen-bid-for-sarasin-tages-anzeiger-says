The Swiss Raiffeisen group secured
support from the U.K. investment group H.I.G. Private Equity to
buy Bank Sarasin & Cie. AG, Zurich-based newspaper Tages-
Anzeiger reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  Sarasin’s management doesn’t want to team up with  Julius
Baer , according to the newspaper report. Sarasin would prefer to
work with Raiffeisen, hoping that the bank would be “kept on a
long leash,” the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
