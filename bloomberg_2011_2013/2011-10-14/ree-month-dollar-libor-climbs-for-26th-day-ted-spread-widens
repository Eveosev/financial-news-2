The rate at which London-based banks
say they can borrow for three months in dollars rose for the
26th straight day, reaching the highest level since August 2010.  The London interbank offered rate, or Libor, for dollar
loans climbed to 0.40472 percent from 0.40306 percent yesterday,
data from the British Bankers’ Association showed. That’s the
highest since Aug. 9, 2010.  Credit Agricole SA submitted the highest rate today among
the contributing panel of 19 lenders, at 0.4650 percent, up from
0.4625 percent yesterday. HSBC Holdings Plc posted the lowest,
at 0.2750 percent, unchanged from yesterday.  The dollar Libor-OIS spread, a gauge of banks’ reluctance
to lend, widened to 32.57 basis points at 12:07 p.m. London
time, from 31.91 basis points yesterday. That’s the most since
July 21, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, widened to
38.95 basis points from 38.79 basis points yesterday. It reached
39.75 basis points on Oct. 11, the highest level since June 28,
2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
