Zijin Mining Group Co. has sold
bonds convertible into shares of Glencore International Plc, the
world’s largest publicly traded commodities supplier, according
to three people familiar with the matter.  The bonds were sold at 128.25 percent of face value, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
process was private.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  managed the sale,
according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News.  Zijin Mining,  China ’s biggest gold miner by market value,
acquired the bonds ahead of Glencore’s May initial public
offering, which ended its more than three decades as a closely
held partnership. Glencore, which sold $10 billion of shares in
the biggest IPO this year, has dropped 20 percent since going
public.  In December 2009 Glencore had sold $2.2 billion of
convertible 5 percent bonds, its first such offering, saying the
debt could be exchanged for shares in the event of an IPO. Zijin
Mining invested in those bonds together with  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) ,
Government of Singapore Investment Corp. and First Reserve Corp.  Zijin was offering the $175 million of December 2014 bonds
at 128.25 percent to 130.25 percent of face value, plus accrued
interest, according to the term sheet.  First Reserve, a private equity firm, sold $800 million of
the bonds last month at $135,313.89 for each $100,000 of
principal amount, and used the proceeds to buy Glencore common
stock.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and Morgan Stanley managed First
Reserve’s transaction.  A call made to the Zijin’s office outside of regular
business hours wasn’t answered.  Simon Buerk , a spokesman for
Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore, declined to comment.  Glencore dropped 3 percent to 422.5 pence at the close of
London trading, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 2.8
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
