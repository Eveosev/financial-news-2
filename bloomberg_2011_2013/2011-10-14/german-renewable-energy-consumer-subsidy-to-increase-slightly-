German consumers will see a
component of their power bills that subsidizes renewable energy
output rise “slightly” next year as solar panel installations
lag and higher wholesale electricity prices temper the effect
for households, the country’s power grid regulator said.  The rate will rise to 3.592 cents a kilowatt-hour in 2012
from 3.53 cents this year, the Bonn-based Federal Network Agency
said today in an e-mailed  statement , citing data supplied by
 Germany ’s power grid operators.  The regulator, known as the Bundesnetzagentur in German,
said it expects 4.5 gigawatts of solar panels to be installed
next year compared with about 7 gigawatts in the “boom year”
of 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
