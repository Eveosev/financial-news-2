U.K. stocks advanced, with the  FTSE
100 Index (UKX)  headed for its longest streak of weekly gains since
April, after International Monetary Fund members discussed
boosting its capital to help end Europe’s debt crisis.  Fresnillo Plc (FRES) , the world’s largest primary silver miner,
and  BP Plc (BP/) , the U.K.’s second biggest oil producer by market
value, advanced as metals and oil prices rose.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index climbed 62.98, or 1.2 percent,
to 5,466.36 at the close in London. The gauge rose for the third
week, its longest streak of weekly gains since April. Even then,
the measure is 10 percent lower than this year’s peak on Feb. 8
amid concern that Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis will deepen.
The FTSE All-Share Index added 1.1 percent and Ireland’s ISEQ
increased 1.6 percent today.  Nations from  China  to Brazil are considering increasing the
IMF’s lending resources to help stem the euro area’s debt
crisis, Group of 20 and IMF officials said.  Policy makers have discussed expanding the IMF’s firepower
as part of a global G-20 agreement next month in Cannes, France,
according to three officials, who declined to be named because
the discussions are not public. The talks are at a preliminary
stage as potential contributors wait to see what measures the
Europeans take to end the debt turmoil at their Oct. 23 summit,
the officials said.  U.S. Data  Stocks extended gains today after a report showed U.S.
retail sales rose more than forecast in September, easing
concern that slumping confidence and scant hiring will derail
the biggest part of the economy.  Fresnillo climbed 1.9 percent to 1,660 pence as silver
prices rose. Copper, nickel and tin also gained.  Vedanta
Resources Plc (VED)  jumped 1.2 percent to 1,213 pence.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) 
increased 2.5 percent to 900 pence. An index of basic resources
shares in the Stoxx Europe 600 rallied 1.4 percent.  Ferrexpo Plc (FXPO) , a producer of iron ore in Ukraine, soared 7.3
percent to 339 pence. UBS AG raised its rating on the stock
“buy” from “neutral,” citing a “positive” price outlook
for the raw material.  BP added 2.6 percent to 416.4 pence as oil advanced in New
York.  Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  gained 2.5 percent to 298.7 pence.  Tullow
Oil Plc (TLW)  increased 4.7 percent to 1,424 pence.  Hunting Plc (HTG) , a holding company for oil and gas providers,
surged 5.4 percent to 643 pence. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
initiated the stock with a “buy” recommendation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
