The German state of North Rhine-
Westphalia, acting in concert with the federal government,
acquired a “tax CD” related to Luxembourg, according to the
German Finance Ministry.  The information contained on the compact disc has been made
available to affected states for evaluation, the ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement.  The CD contained data from 3,000 customers of the
Luxembourg branch of  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and the CD cost 3 million
euros ($4.2 million), Financial Times Deutschland reported
earlier today.  Lisa Baitup, a London-based HSBC spokeswoman, declined to
comment on the FT Deutschland report when contacted by Bloomberg
News by phone today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
