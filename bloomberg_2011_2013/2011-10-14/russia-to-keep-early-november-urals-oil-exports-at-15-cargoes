Russia , the worldâ€™s largest oil
producer, will maintain exports of Urals crude from its Baltic
Sea port of Primorsk in the first five days of November, a
partial loading schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  Shipments, amounting to 10 cargoes, will total 1 million
metric tons, or 7.3 million barrels, the plan showed.  Urals exports from Novorossiysk on the  Black Sea  for Nov. 1
to Nov. 5 will be five cargoes, including two 140,000-ton
shipments and three 80,000-ton lots, also unchanged from this
month, according to the program.  A 75,000-ton cargo of Siberian Light crude will be loaded
from the Black Sea port of Tuapse on Nov. 2 to Nov. 3, the
schedule showed.  The full shipping plan will be released later this month.
Loading programs are schedules of crude shipments compiled by
field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply
and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
