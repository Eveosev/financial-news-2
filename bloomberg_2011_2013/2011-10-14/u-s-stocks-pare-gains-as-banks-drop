U.S. stocks pared gains as banks
erased their advance, trimming an early rally led by technology
companies after Google Inc.’s results topped estimates and Apple
Inc. prepared to sell a new version of its iPhone.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.8 percent to
1,212.81 at 11:24 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 1.5
percent.  European officials are considering writedowns of as much as
50 percent on Greek bonds, a backstop for banks and continued
central bank bond purchases as key planks in a revamped strategy
to combat the debt crisis, people familiar with the discussions
told Bloomberg News.  The  S&P 500  pared its advance after rising to 1,221.46,
near levels where rallies stopped in August and September. The
gauge closed at 1,218.89 on Aug. 31 before dropping 4.4 percent
in the next three sessions, and closed at 1,216.01 on Sept. 16
before losing 7.1 percent by Sept. 22.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
