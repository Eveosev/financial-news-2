The European Financial Stability
Facility might be allowed to guarantee as much as 30 percent of
new bond sales by a distressed euro-area government as part of
fresh plans to stem the debt crisis, said a person familiar with
the matter.  Possible EFSF authority to guarantee a portion of new
national debt sales in the euro area is likely to cover at least
20 percent, the European official said today in Brussels on the
condition of anonymity.  As European leaders prepare for a crisis meeting on Oct.
23, they are debating how best to equip the 440 billion-euro
($607 billion) EFSF for its new powers to intervene in the
primary and secondary markets for sovereign bonds, to offer
credit lines to governments and to recapitalize banks. The
EFSF’s role so far has been to sell bonds to finance rescue
loans.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
