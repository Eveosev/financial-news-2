Nicholas Cosmo, who pleaded guilty
to running a $413 million  Ponzi scheme  that defrauded thousands
of investors, was sentenced to 25 years in prison, prosecutors
said.  Cosmo, owner of Agape World Inc. and Agape Merchant Advance
LLC, was arrested in January 2009. He claimed Agape solicited
investor funds that were used to make short-term bridge loans.
Agape received about $413 million from investors, while only
about $30 million in loans were made, according to the
government. Actual losses to victims were about $195 million.  “Those who lie and steal from the investing public are on
notice that they face severe penalties,” U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in  Brooklyn  said today in a statement. “As recounted
today in court by several of his victims, the defendant’s
actions crushed the hopes and dreams of everyday citizens.”  Cosmo, who was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Denis Hurley in Central Islip,  New York , operated the scheme from
October 2003 to January 2009. He solicited funds from investors
“well in excess” of what he told them was needed for bridge
loans, prosecutors said, and then pocketed the money.  Richard W. Levitt, a lawyer for Cosmo at Levitt & Kaizer in
New York, didn’t immediately return a call seeking comment on
the sentence.  In August 2010, Richard Barry, a former vice president and
underwriter at Agape World Inc., pleaded guilty participating in
the scheme. He’s scheduled to be sentenced Nov. 2.  Agape had offices in Hauppauge on  Long Island , and in  New
York City ’s Queens neighborhoods of Maspeth and Jackson Heights.  Cosmo’s case is U.S. v. Cosmo, 09-cr-00255, and Barry’s
case is U.S. v. Barry, 10-cr-00648, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of New York ( Central Islip ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
