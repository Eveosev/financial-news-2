The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development lowered its 2012 economic outlook
for Ireland as export growth slows and said this may threaten
the country’s deficit-reduction plans.  Gross domestic product will rise 1 percent next year, the
Paris-based OECD said in a report today, after forecasting
expansion of 2.3 percent in May. The group raised its forecast
for this year to 1.2 percent growth from stagnation.  Slower-than-projected global growth may make it more
difficult for Ireland to achieve a “sound fiscal position,”
the OECD said, adding that this is “achievable.” Prime
Minister  Enda Kenny ’s government has pledged to narrow the
deficit to about 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2015
from about 10 percent this year.  “Providing that growth allows, the authorities should
reduce the deficit faster than required,” the  OECD  said in
today’s report. “Participants in financial markets are not yet
fully convinced that Ireland will be able to return to a path of
fiscal sustainability, as reflected by high sovereign risk
spreads.”  The cost of insuring against Ireland defaulting for five
years has dropped to 743 basis points from 1,296 since July 18,
according to CMA prices. Swaps still implying a 47 percent
probability of Ireland failing to meet its obligations.  Net export growth may slow to 2.5 percent next year from
3.7 percent this year, the OECD. The country’s unemployment rate
will probably remain at 14.2 percent next year, the same as this
year, before falling to 13.9 percent in 2013, as growth
accelerates, the OECD said. Gross domestic product will expand
2.4 percent in 2013, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
