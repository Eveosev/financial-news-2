VTB Capital, an investment arm of
 Russia ’s state-owned lender, agreed to become a cornerstone
investor in Polymetal International Plc’s planned share sale in
 London , the gold miner said in a prospectus.  VTB Capital will buy as much as $100 million of the stock,
taking up a maximum of one-third of the offering, the document
obtained by Bloomberg News shows. Russian gold and silver miner
OAO Polymetal intends to gain a primary listing in the city by
year-end, by swapping shares with those of Jersey-based
Polymetal International Plc.  Holders of 52 percent of OAO Polymetal shares have agreed
to the swap, while minority investors have until Oct. 21 to
decide. Polymetal International plans to sell $500 million of
stock to help fund a buyout of shareholders who decide against
the swap, according to a Sept. 30 statement.  VTB Capital’s press office declined to make any immediate
comment when contacted by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
