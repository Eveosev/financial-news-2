Russia should stop “dreaming”
about economic growth of more than 4 percent, Moskovskiye
Novosti reported, citing an  interview  with central bank First
Deputy Chairman  Alexei Ulyukayev .  Growth is constrained by corruption, administrative
barriers, state control of the economy and a flawed legal
system, Ulyukayev was quoted as saying by the Moscow-based
newspaper.  The country’s inflation rate may drop below 7 percent this
year and the government will probably run a budget surplus,
Ulyukayev said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
