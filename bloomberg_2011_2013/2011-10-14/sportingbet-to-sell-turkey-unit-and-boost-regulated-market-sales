Sportingbet Plc (SBT) , an online sports
betting company, said it agreed to sell its Turkish-language
website to East  Pioneer Corp. (6773)  for at least 125 million pounds
($197 million) to increase its revenue from regulated markets.  East Pioneer has a service agreement with Isle of Man-based
 GVC Holdings Plc (GVC) , Sportingbet said in a statement on Regulatory
News Service.  This week, Ladbrokes Plc ended takeover talks with
Sportingbet in part because of concerns about possible
liabilities linked to its presence in Turkey, where  Internet
gambling  is not licensed. Today Sportingbet said the sale will
push the proportion of its revenue from regulated markets to
half, and later to as much as 70 percent.  “Following this disposal, Sportingbet will derive the
large majority of its earnings from regulated territories,”
Chief Executive Officer Andrew McIver said in the statement.
“The proceeds from the sale of this unregulated income stream
will be used to drive forward the rest of the group.”  At first, the sale and move toward regulated markets will
cut profit as the company seeks to comply with rules and taxes
in the licensed markets, Sportingbet said. Later, profit may
grow even though costs will be higher.  Earlier this week, Sportingbet acquired two Danish gambling
companies to expand in  Denmark , which starts licensing online
betting on Jan. 1.  The Turkish sale price is based on Sportingbet receiving a
portion of the profit for at least three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
