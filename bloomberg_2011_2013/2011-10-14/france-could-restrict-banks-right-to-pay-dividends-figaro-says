France  could restrict the right of
banks to pay dividends to make sure they keep lending, daily Le
Figaro reported, citing an unidentified person close to the
country’s finance minister  Francois Baroin .  The newspaper cited a person described as a financial
specialist as saying that French banks wouldn’t be in their
current situation had they not paid out so much in dividends
over the last three years.  The French governement isn’t deaf to market demands for
bank refinancing, the newspaper cited an unnamed person in the
 finance ministry  as saying. The ministry believes that French
banks are solid and that they don’t have problems of liquidity
or solvency, Le Figaro added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
