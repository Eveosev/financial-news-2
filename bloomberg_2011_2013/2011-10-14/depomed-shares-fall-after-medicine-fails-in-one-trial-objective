Depomed Inc. (DEPO) , the maker of an
experimental drug to treat menopausal hot flashes, fell the most
in two years after saying the medicine failed to meet one of
four objectives in a late-stage study.  Depomed dropped 21 percent to $4.94 as of 4 p.m.  New York 
time for the biggest decline since Oct. 12, 2009. The shares are
down 22 percent this year.  The treatment, Serada, was effective for three of the four
primary endpoints evaluating the frequency and severity of hot
flashes at four and 12 weeks of treatment,  Menlo Park ,
California-based Depomed said in a statement yesterday. The
company will review the results of the Phase 3 clinical trial,
the last of three phases generally required for U.S. marketing
clearance from the  Food and Drug Administration .  Serada “had already failed in two previous Phase 3
trials,” said Difei Yang, an analyst with Auriga USA LLC in New
York, in a telephone interview. “They made a number of changes
for this third try, and they came close, but they didn’t quite
hit it.”  The data from the study is sufficient to discuss with the
FDA a way to move forward, Chief Executive Officer Jim Schoeneck
said in the statement.  Yang recommends buying Depomed shares, and lowered her
price target to $7 from $10. She doesn’t own the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
