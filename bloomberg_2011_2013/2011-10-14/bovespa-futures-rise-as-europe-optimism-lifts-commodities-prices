The Bovespa stock index posted its
biggest weekly gain in more than two years as a commodities
rally sparked by optimism that European leaders will resolve the
region’s sovereign debt crisis boosted the outlook for Brazil’s
biggest companies.  Klabin SA,  Latin America ’s biggest paper maker, rose to a
four-month high after saying it plans to buy back as much as 10
percent of its publicly traded shares. Vale SA, the world’s
largest iron-ore producer, had the biggest weekly gain in 15
months.  The Bovespa climbed 0.8 percent to 55,030.45 at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo. That pushed the weekly advance to 7.4
percent, the steepest rise since May 2009. Forty-eight stocks
gained on the gauge, while 17 fell. The real strengthened 1.2
percent to 1.7302 per  U.S. dollar .  “There are signs that the global economy may not be doing
as badly as it looked before, and  Europe  seems to be getting
closer to solving its problems,” Dany Rappaport, who helps
manage about 160 million reais ($92 million) at Investport, said
by phone from  Sao Paulo .  Group of 20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in
Paris today and tomorrow to discuss the euro area’s debt crisis.
Officials are outlining a rescue plan that may include deeper
investor losses on Greek bonds, higher bank capital levels and
increased firepower for bailouts and the  International Monetary
Fund .  In the U.S., retail sales rose more than forecast in
September, easing concern slumping confidence and scant hiring
will derail the biggest part of the economy.  Commodities Rally  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
advanced 2.4 percent today and rose 5.2 percent since Oct. 7,
the biggest weekly gain since December.  Vale increased 0.6 percent to 41.18 reais. It jumped 7.5
percent this week, the most since July 2010. Klabin gained 2.2
percent to 5.92 reais and had a weekly advance of 6.1 percent.  Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais SA led steelmakers
higher, rising 3 percent to 11.14 reais. It gained 7.1 percent
this week. Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA climbed 1.4 percent to
14.79 reais, pushing its weekly advance to 7.8 percent.  The Bovespa earlier dropped as much as 0.3 percent on
speculation borrowing costs in  Brazil  may not fall as much as
previously expected, dimming the outlook for companies that
depend on credit growth.  Yields on most interest-rate futures contracts rose. The
yields on the contract maturing in January 2013, the most traded
today in Sao Paulo, climbed 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage
point, to 10.55 percent.  Market Volatility  “The market is still very volatile, and we don’t see any
real trend,” said Eduardo Favrin, who oversees about $3.2
billion as head of equities at HSBC Global Asset Management’s
Brazil unit in Sao Paulo. “We’re still reacting on a daily
basis depending on the news.”  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge entered a  bear market  in
July after plunging 20 percent from its 2010 bull-market peak.
The measure has since extended that drop to 25 percent and
trades at 8.9 times analysts’ earnings estimates, weekly data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares to a ratio of 9.5 for
MSCI Inc.’s gauge of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Traders moved 5.58 billion reais in stocks in Sao Paulo
today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares to a daily
average this year of 6.58 billion reais through Oct. 13,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
