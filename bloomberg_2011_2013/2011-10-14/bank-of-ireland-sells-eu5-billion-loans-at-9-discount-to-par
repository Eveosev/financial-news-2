Bank of Ireland Plc’s agreed sale of
about 5 billion euros of loans averaged at a 9 percent discount
to par value, a company spokeswoman said by phone.  The bank said in a statement today that the sale of the
loans, including U.S. and U.K. commercial real-estate loans,
will have a “neutral” impact on its core tier 1 capital ratio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
