U.S. and European Union antitrust
regulators urged companies to file for regulatory approval for
takeovers “at broadly the same time” to avoid “inconsistent”
decisions.  The Department of Justice’s antitrust division and the
European Commission agreed on rules this week for cooperating
when both regulators are reviewing on the same deal, the
Brussels-based EU said today.  Companies can make a “substantial contribution” to
cooperation “by making sure that the two authorities are
notified at the same time,” the European Commission said in an
e-mailed statement. “Such cooperation is in the merging
parties’ interest to avoid inconsistent remedies.”  EU regulators threatened  in 2009 to block Oracle Corp.’s
purchase of Sun Microsystems Inc. even though the U.S. approved
the deal and didn’t share the EU’s concern over possible
competition problems in the database market. EU officials said
at the time that it was “unusual” for another regulator to
comment on an ongoing probe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
