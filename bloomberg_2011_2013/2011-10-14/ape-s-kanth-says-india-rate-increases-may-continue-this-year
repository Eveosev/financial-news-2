Kislay Kanth, head of research at
MAPE Securities Pvt., comments on  India ’s inflation and interest
rates. He spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  The benchmark wholesale-price index rose 9.72 percent from
a year earlier after a 9.78 percent jump in August, the
government said in a statement today. The median of 21 estimates
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 9.75 percent increase.  “Unless inflation is visibly lower, maybe around 8.5
percent, the central bank won’t be pausing on interest rate
increases.  ‘‘Weekly food inflation data or monthly data is not showing
any respite. We could have a situation where monetary tightening
continues for the rest of the year.  ‘‘It may become unsustainable for the economy because most
banks haven’t passed on the previous rate increases. The central
bank would be looking at that aspect as well.  ‘‘Giving another 50 basis-point increase, when the previous
rate increases have not achieved the objective, will not serve
any purpose. The central bank should increase rates by 25 basis
points and persuade banks to pass it on.  ‘‘The root cause of our inflation is  government spending ,
which is not helping in creating capital. The spending is more
of consumption.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
