German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that banks are going to have to shoulder part of the euro
sovereign debt crisis costs.  “We want and we have to make sure that banks and other
investors share the costs of getting over the crisis,” Merkel
said in a speech to trade unionists today in Karlsruhe,  Germany .  European officials are crafting a rescue plan that may
include deeper investor losses on Greek bonds, higher bank
capital levels and increased firepower for bailouts and the
 International Monetary Fund . European leaders may complete the
plan at an Oct. 23 summit and present it to a gathering of Group
of 20 chiefs Nov. 3-4.  Merkel said that euro bonds “aren’t a wonder drug” for
the crisis and wouldn’t help at the moment.  “They would reward highly indebted states with lower
 interest rates  while giving us higher interest rates,” she
said. “Therefore, it is my deep conviction that euro bonds
won’t help us under the present conditions.”  Merkel said any Greek debt writedown should only take place
after careful preparation and under specific conditions.  “A Greek debt writedown, even if it takes place, should
only be ventured after careful and conscientious preparation in
order to prevent anything worse from happening and to pave the
way for structural reforms,” Merkel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
