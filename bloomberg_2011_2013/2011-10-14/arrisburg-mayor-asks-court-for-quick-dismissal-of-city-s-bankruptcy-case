Harrisburg Mayor Linda D. Thompson
requested an emergency court hearing to seek dismissal of the
 Pennsylvania  capital’s bankruptcy case, saying the filing was
unauthorized.  A lawyer purporting to represent the city faxed the
bankruptcy petition to the  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in Harrisburg
at about 10:30 p.m. on Oct. 11. Late yesterday, Thompson
submitted papers to the bankruptcy judge saying the petition was
“filed without requisite authority” and “must be dismissed.”  Thompson said her lawyers will file a formal dismissal
motion “shortly.” In the meantime, she asked the judge to set up
a conference quickly to schedule an emergency motion for
dismissal of the bankruptcy.  The city council voted 4-3 on Oct. 11 in favor of the
Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy. The city claims to be insolvent,
unable to pay its debt, and in imminent danger of having  tax
revenue  seized by holders of defaulted bonds.  The city is $65 million in default on $242 million owing on
bonds sold to finance an incinerator that converts trash to
energy, according to court papers. The bonds are insured by
Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp.  Assets and debt are both less than $500 million, according
to the bankruptcy petition.  The case is In re City of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 11-
06938, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Middle District of Pennsylvania
(Harrisburg).  To contact the reporter on this story:
