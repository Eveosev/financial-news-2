The U.S. government posted its third
consecutive annual  budget deficit  in excess of $1 trillion in
the fiscal year ended Sept. 30.  The shortfall registered $1.3 trillion in fiscal 2011, up
from $1.29 trillion in 2010 and the second-highest on record,
according to Treasury Department data issued today in
Washington. It reached $1.42 trillion in 2009, the highest ever.
The September gap widened to $64.6 billion from $34.6 billion in
the same month last year.  “This report confirms that we cannot waste any time in
jump-starting economic growth and  job creation  to lay the
foundation for a stronger economy and lower future deficits,”
 Jacob Lew , director of the White House Office of Management and
Budget, said in a statement.  The budget deficit for fiscal 2011 was 8.7 percent of gross
domestic product, down from 9 percent in 2010, according to the
Treasury data. The gap reached 10 percent of GDP in 2009, the
highest since 1945, according to the  Congressional Budget
Office .  “There is a lot of red ink on the government’s balance
sheet and Congress appears clueless on how to make it
disappear,”  Chris Rupkey , chief financial economist at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd. in  New York , said before today’s
report.  Automatic Cuts  A special 12-member congressional committee has been
ordered to find $1.5 trillion in savings over the next decade
under the terms of the debt-ceiling deal reached in August. If
Congress fails to act on the group’s recommendations by Dec. 23,
the compromise will trigger automatic cuts.  The panel’s closed-door meetings for the past month have
focused on spending cuts in areas accounting for 12 percent of
the federal budget -- the same areas lawmakers discussed in
previous unsuccessful talks led by Vice President  Joe Biden ,
according to one Republican and one Democratic aide who weren’t
authorized to speak publicly.  Today is the deadline for congressional committee leaders
to submit recommendations to help identify the savings. The
bipartisan committee is assigned to propose a plan by Nov. 23,
and if Congress doesn’t pass it by the December deadline,
spending cuts of $1.2 trillion would begin in fiscal 2013.  Ongoing Negotiations  House Democrats made their recommendations yesterday,
focusing more on job creation than debt reduction. After a
series of standoffs over spending cuts sought by  House
Republicans  that almost shut down the government, Republican
leaders of House committees overseeing taxes and entitlements
aren’t offering formal proposals on how they would cut the
government.  “It is going to be a long and painful process as the
economy has slowed to the stall speed, and while you can’t grow
your way out of your debts, it obviously helps speed up the
timetable,” Rupkey said.  Spending rose 4.2 percent in fiscal 2011 from a year
earlier to $3.6 trillion, according to the Treasury. Revenue
climbed 6.5 percent to $2.3 trillion.  Before the release of the annual statistics, the OMB and
the non-partisan CBO both estimated a fiscal 2011 budget of $1.3
trillion.  To contact the reporters on this story:
