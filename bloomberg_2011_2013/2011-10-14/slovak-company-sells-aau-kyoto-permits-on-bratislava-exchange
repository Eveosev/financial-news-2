An unspecified Slovak company was
seeking to sell 90,000 metric tons of  Assigned Amount Unit 
greenhouse-gas permits on Commodity Exchange Bratislava for at
least 5.40 euros ($7.46) each, said an official at the exchange.  In a sale that’s the first of its kind, buyers can place
bids through Oct. 31, Ludovit Scholtz, secretary general of the
exchange in Slovakia, said today by phone. The sale of the AAUs
started at 9 a.m. local time. “We wanted to give everyone a
fair amount of time,” he said.  Details of the company and the country of origin of the
AAUs are available to “serious” bidders willing to sign a non-
disclosure agreement, Scholtz said. AAUs are granted to
developed nations with emissions targets in the 1997  Kyoto
Protocol  for the five years through 2012.  Buyers require collateral of at least 2 percent of their
bids, Scholtz said. The permits are linked to emission
reductions under a process known as a Green Investment Scheme,
he said.  The so-called greening program is meant to provide
environmental credibility and avoid accusations by environmental
groups that some eastern European nations sell “hot air” after
a slump in their industrial production following the fall of
communism drove their greenhouse-gas emissions below targets.  To contact the reporters on this story:
