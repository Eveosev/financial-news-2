Serbia’s diversified group Farmakom
MB d.o.o. received a 120 million-euro ($165.7 million) loan from
a group led by the International Finance Corp., the  World Bank ’s
unit for private-sector lending.  The IFC provided 40 million euros of the credit and
organized syndication from commercial lenders, including 30
million euros from  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) , 35 million euros from
Belgrade-based Komercijalna Banka AD, 5 million euros from
 Cacanska Banka AD (CCNB)  and 10 million euros from the Serb unit of
Banca Intesa SpA.  “It’s a landmark transaction, one of the biggest this year
in southeast  Europe ” said Guy Ellena, an IFC director, during a
signing ceremony with  Farmakom  owner and manager Miroslav Bogicevic.  The  company , which has mining, agriculture, retail and
dairy units, will use the loan to “restructure its balance
sheet” and expand operations, Bogicevic said. The company had
revenue of 300 million euros last year and plans to open four
mines next year, digging zinc, antimony, lead and gold.  The eight-year loan comes with a two-year grace period the
Euribor rate plus 6.5 percent. The rate will fall to the Euribor
rate plus 4 percent once Farmakom MB “improves its corporate
governance structure,” said Vladimir Zivanovic, Farmakom’s
chief for investments and development.  To contact the reporter on this story:
