Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index fell,
ending its longest winning streak since 2009, after  China ’s
continued inflation reduced chances for a relaxation of monetary
policy, and after Spain and some banks’ ratings were cut.  China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd. (688) , a developer
controlled by the nation’s construction ministry, dropped 4.2
percent.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd., the
nation’s biggest lender by market value, slid 4.3 percent.
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) , the U.K.’s second-biggest lender, slid
2.3 percent as rating cuts for Spain and some European banks
weighed on optimism the region’s debt crisis will be contained.  The Hang Seng Index fell 1.4 percent to 18,501.79, paring
its weekly advance to 4.5 percent. Almost five stocks declined
for each that gained on the 46-member gauge.  The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of Chinese companies
listed in Hong Kong slid 2.2 percent to 9,584.83, extending its
decline in late trading after central bank data showed the
nation’s M2  money supply  rose 13 percent last month. That’s the
slowest pace since 2002, according to Bloomberg Data.  “The fact that inflation is still high shows it’s unlikely
that the central bank will relax money supply so soon,” said
Francis Lun, managing director at Lyncean Holdings Ltd. “The
market has been overbought in the short term, and it’s mainly
profit taking. It has been euphoria, a paradise for investors.”  6-Day Surge  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  surged 15 percent in the six days
through yesterday, amid optimism European leaders were moving
closer to a plan for taming the debt crisis. Shares also gained
as China signaled support for large banks and small companies.  Companies on the index traded at 10 times forecast earnings,
around March 2009 levels. That compares with 12.1 times for the
 Standard & Poor’s  500 Index.  Developers and banks declined the most among the Hang Seng
Index’s four industry groups, after the National Bureau of
Statistics said China’s consumer prices increased 6.1 percent
from a year earlier in September, matching the median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey. That follows a 6.2 percent gain in
August.  China Overseas retreated 4.2 percent to HK$13.60, and  China
Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled developer, sank 6.3
percent to HK$10.04. ICBC declined 4.3 percent to HK$4.25, and
China Construction Bank Corp., the nation’s No. 2 lender by
market value, lost 2.5 percent to HK$5.14.  Tight Reins  China has raised  interest rates  and reserve-requirement
ratios for banks to cool inflation that’s at the highest level
in almost three years. The nation’s central bank Governor Zhou
Xiaochuan said last month inflation remained China’s “top
concern.”  Europe-related shares declined after Spain had its  credit
rating  cut one level to AA- by Standard & Poor’s, citing
heightened risks to the country’s growth prospects.  Standard Chartered retreated 2.3 percent to HK$172.50, and
 HSBC Holdings Plc (5) , Europe’s largest bank by market value, sank
1.5 percent to HK$63.70.  Esprit Holdings Ltd. (330) , a clothier that
counts Europe as its biggest market, slid 1.5 percent to
HK$11.60.  “The financial profile of the Spanish banking system will,
in our opinion, weaken further, with the stock of problematic
assets rising further,” S&P said in a statement.  Hopes for Solution  “Investors are hoping Europe will find a solution to the
sovereign-debt crisis, but if that doesn’t happen the market
could come back down again,” said Lee King Fuei, a Singapore-
based fund manager at Schroders Plc, which oversaw $323 billion
as of June 30. “Politically, it’s going to be difficult to find
a solution. Governments in the U.S. and Europe are left with
limited stimulus options.”  Rating downgrades for European banks also added to concern
about the outlook for the region. UBS AG, Lloyds Banking Group
Plc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc had long-term issuer
default grades cut by Fitch Ratings, which put more than a dozen
other lenders on watch negative as part of a global review.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index slid 1 percent to 18,432.
The HSI Volatility Index rose 0.1 percent to 33.23, indicating
options traders expect a swing of 10 percent in the Hang Seng
Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
