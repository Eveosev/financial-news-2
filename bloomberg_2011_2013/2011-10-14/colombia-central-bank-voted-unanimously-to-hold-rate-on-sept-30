Colombian policy makers last month
kept the benchmark rate unchanged at a two-year high, arguing
that future decisions would depend on changes to the “risk
balance” between the “strong dynamics” of  Colombia ’s economy
and “more risks and uncertainty” abroad.  In a second straight unanimous vote, the board on Sept. 30
kept the rate at 4.5 percent, which policy makers said is “in a
good position to answer to the new information,” according to
the minutes of the meeting published today on the central bank’s
website.  Policy makers kept the key lending rate unchanged for a
second month after raising borrowing costs at their seven
previous meetings, noting “high uncertainty” about the
“fiscal situation of some developed markets,” according to
minutes. At the same time, policy makers said they expect third-
quarter growth in  South America ’s fourth-biggest economy will
exceed the pace seen in the first half of 2011 and still see the
economy expanding as much as 6.5 percent this year.  “The Board will continue to carefully monitor the
international situation, together with inflation behavior and
forecasts, growth, active markets behavior, and it reiterates
that future monetary policy will depend on the new information
available,” policy makers said in the minutes.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 1894.85 per dollar at 12:57
