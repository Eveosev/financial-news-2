Indonesia ’s rupiah gained, snapping
a five-week decline, and bonds rose as foreign funds boosted
holdings of the nation’s assets.  Government debt rallied for a third week, pushing the
yields to record low, as the central bank lowered its benchmark
 interest rate  by 25 basis points to 6.50 percent on Oct. 11 and
purchased sovereign bonds this month. Overseas investors bought
$237 million more Indonesian shares than they sold in the first
four days of this week, according to exchange data.  “We saw funds coming into Indonesian markets,” said
Wiling Bolung, head of treasury at ANZ Panin Bank in Jakarta.
“The confidence has returned as Bank Indonesia has managed the
situation well. Certainly, the investor sentiment has turned
positive.”  The rupiah appreciated 0.6 percent this week to 8,848 per
dollar as of 4 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local
banks complied by Bloomberg. The currency declined more than 4
percent in the previous five weeks. The yield on the 10-year
bond fell 49 basis points, or 0.49 percentage point, to 6.38
percent today, according to the Inter-Dealer Market Association.  Foreign ownership of the nation’s debt rose 0.7 percent to
214 trillion rupiah ($24 billion) in the first two days of this
week, according to data from the finance ministry’s website.  Bank Indonesia  is selling dollars when needed to ease
