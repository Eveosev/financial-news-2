Malaysia’s ringgit was set for a
second weekly gain after Prime Minister Najib Razak forecast
that economic growth will quicken next year.  Gross domestic product may rise as much as 6 percent from a
maximum of 5.5 percent this year and the country’s budget
deficit is forecast to narrow to 4.7 percent of GDP from 5.4
percent, Najib said last week. Industrial output rose a faster-
than-expected 3 percent in August from a year earlier after
contracting a revised 0.5 percent in July, the Statistics
Department said on Oct. 11. The ringgit held its advance after
neighboring  Singapore  reduced the pace of currency gains it is
seeking rather than halting appreciation.  “The ringgit is firmer for the week because of the better
local economic data,” said Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, a currency
strategist at CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “The
pressure for the ringgit to weaken is still there given current
global uncertainties.”  The ringgit gained 0.5 percent this week to 3.1440 per
dollar as of 9:28 a.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency was little changed today.  The  Singapore dollar  advanced 0.3 percent after the
nation’s central bank said it would seek slower currency
appreciation this year as the global economy slows.  Malaysian  government bonds  fell this week. The yield on the
4.262 percent notes due September 2016 rose one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 3.33 percent through yesterday,
according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
