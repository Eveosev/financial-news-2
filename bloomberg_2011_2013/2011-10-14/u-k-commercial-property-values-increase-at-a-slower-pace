U.K. commercial real estate prices
rose at a slower pace in September, held back by retail
buildings, Investment Property Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses
increased 1.7 percent in September from a year earlier, London-
based IPD said today on its website. That compares with a 1.8
percent increase in August. Prices rose 0.1 percent from the
previous month.  U.K. commercial real-estate  values have increased for 26
straight months. Investors are starting to look outside central
 London , where buildings have appreciated most, to “find more
competitive assets,” IPD said.  “Occupier demand remained strong across the London office
market,” said Phil Tily, IPD’s managing director for the U.K.
and Ireland, and “growth seems to be off the back of continuing
rental increases.”  The total return, which combines the change in property
values and rental income, amounted to 8.7 percent in September
from a year earlier, the research company said.  “Despite growing concerns over a pricing bubble in the
Central London office market,” total returns for September were
0.6 percent, IPD said.  The index was compiled from appraisals of 3,663 properties
valued at 34.5 billion pounds ($54.6 billion) at the end of
September, IPD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
