The London International Financial
Futures & Options Exchange will reinstate the March 2012
delivery month of the long gilt futures contract with a 4
percent notional coupon, it said in a statement late yesterday.  The notional coupon was revised down from 6 percent after
the Bank of England expanded its bond-purchase program last
week, prompting the Oct. 7 suspension of the March 2012 and June
2012 delivery months on the contract.  No changes will be made to the December 2011 contract, the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
