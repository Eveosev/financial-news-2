The Philippine government will buy
as much as 400 million pesos of rough rice damaged by recent
storms to help farmers, Agriculture Secretary Proceso Alcala
said in a phone interview today. The nation has “enough
supply” of rice and won’t add to imports of the grain this
year, he said. The government will decide on the 2012 overseas
purchase plan by next month, Alcala said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
