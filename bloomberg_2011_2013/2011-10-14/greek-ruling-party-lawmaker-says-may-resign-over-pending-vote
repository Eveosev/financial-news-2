Greek socialist party lawmaker
Thomas Robopoulos plans to submit his resignation on Oct. 17,
ahead of a Parliament vote on austerity measures, in a move that
won’t affect Prime Minister  George Papandreou ’s majority in
Parliament, according to statements made on Radio Thessaloniki
today.  “I will resign and the next member of parliament can take
my place,” Robopoulos told the radio station in  Greece ’s
second-biggest city today, according to an audio transcript on
its website. “On Monday I will decide and submit my
resignation. I am being clear it has to do with matters of
conscience. I can’t be in a parliament where you can’t make a
decision. I can’t be forced to vote, told either you vote for
this or we default.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
