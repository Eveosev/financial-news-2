European leaders need to take action
to safeguard the euro and strengthen the region’s banking
systems, said  BusinessEurope , an employers’ federation.  “EU leaders can make an immediate difference by committing
to support efforts to recapitalize banks,” the group said in a
letter to European government heads released today in Brussels.
“There is no other option but to secure the euro.”  Shoring up lenders would increase financial stability and
promote investment in the short term, BusinessEurope said, with
economic governance changes and fiscal discipline needed in the
long term. The group said it “fully supports” the July 21
agreement to provide new aid to Greece and to expand the scope
of the European Union’s main rescue fund.  BusinessEurope urged the EU to implement its services
directive and make progress on trade negotiations with  Canada ,
Ukraine, India and South American nations. European exporters
will save 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) in tariffs this year
because of a trade agreement between the EU and  South Korea , the
group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
