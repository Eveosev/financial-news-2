Officials from the  International
Monetary Fund  are in Hungary at the invitation of the government
to advise on an overhaul of the country’s local government
system,  Nepszabadsag  reported, citing an unidentified, “highly
ranked” person at the Economy Ministry.  There have been similar consultations with the fund in the
past 1 1/2 years on welfare payments and the labor market, the
newspaper said, adding that no talks are taking place on fresh
loans from the fund.  The talks show that Hungary has not severed links with the
IMF after Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  said last year that the
country needs no further aid from the fund, Nepszabadsag added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
