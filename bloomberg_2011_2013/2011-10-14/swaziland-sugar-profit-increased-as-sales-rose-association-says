Swaziland Sugar Association said
full-year profit increased to 2.8 billion emalangeni ($357
million) in 2010/2011 from 2.6 billion a year earlier.  The increase was due to higher sales, Chief Executive
Officer Mike Matsebula said in the association’s annual report,
released today. While sugar production dropped to 582,000 tons
from 605,600 tons the previous year, sales volume increased
because of a drawdown in stocks, the association said.  The biggest customers for Swaziland’s sugar exports were
the Southern African Customs Union, which took 48 percent, and
the European Union with 44 percent, it said. Swaziland is
 Africa ’s third-largest sugar producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
