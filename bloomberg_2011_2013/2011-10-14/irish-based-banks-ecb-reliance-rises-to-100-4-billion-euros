Irish-based lender’s borrowings from
the  European Central Bank  rose to 100.4 billion euros on Sept.
30 from 97.9 billion euros at the end of the previous month,
according to an Irish central bank spokesman by telephone.   The Irish central bank’s “other assets ” stood at 53.3
billion euros at the end of September, compared with 55.9
billion euros in the previous month. The Dublin-based central
bank has said that “other assets” includes “exceptional
liquidity assistance lending” for Irish banks, without
giving more details.  Ireland’s six state-guaranteed banks account for about 70
percent of the ECB reliance figure, according to a Finance
Ministry presentation published on its website Oct. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
