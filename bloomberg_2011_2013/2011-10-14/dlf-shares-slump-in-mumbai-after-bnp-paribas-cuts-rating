DLF Ltd. (DLFU) ,  India ’s biggest developer,
fell the most in two weeks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
BNP Paribas SA cut their ratings on concern the stock’s rally
was overdone and the company may post lower operating income.  DLF’s rating was lowered to “neutral” from “buy” at
Goldman Sachs and removed from its “Asia Pacific Buy List,”
according to a note to clients today. DLF was also downgraded to
“reduce” from “hold” at BNP Paribas by analyst Avneesh
Sukhija.  The stock, which has rallied 31 percent from this year’s
low on Aug. 26, lost 3.3 percent to 230.55 rupees at 11:38 a.m.
in Mumbai trading, set for its steepest decline since Oct. 3.  “We believe the stock has started to price in asset sales
while we see limited upside to our operational estimates,”
analyst Puneet Jain at Goldman Sachs said in the note. “Going
forward, we expect stock performance to be driven by improvement
in quarterly sales velocity and pick-up in commercial leasing
volumes, but we have limited visibility on the same currently.”  The projected asset sales are unlikely to generate
significant value for DLF, BNP said in its note. Weak quarterly
earnings and an unfavorable judgment in the fine levied by the
antitrust agency could further strain cash flows, BNP said.  The developer said this week it filed a case challenging
the antitrust agency’s order that fined the company 6.3 billion
rupees ($129 million) for “abuse of dominance” related to the
sale of apartments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
