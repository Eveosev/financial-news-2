Ukraine’s hryvnia may weaken 6
percent by the end of the year against the dollar as falling
metal prices widen the country’s current-account deficit,
 Renaissance Capital  said.  RenCap raised its forecast for the shortfall this year to
$8.5 billion from $5 billion to allow for a “global decline in
metals prices,” Anastasia Golovach, a Kiev-based analyst with
the investment bank, wrote in an e-mailed note today. The
hryvnia may fall to 8.5 per dollar from 7.9960 today, she said.  A drop in demand for metals, Ukraine’s biggest export,
pushed the economy into a 15 percent contraction in 2009 after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. curbed demand for
commodities. The central bank’s reserves fell to $34.95 billion
in September from $38.2 billion a month earlier and may slide a
further $7 billion by year-end as it sells foreign currency to
stem the Hryvnia’s retreat, Golovach said.  “Any sharp devaluation could trigger an aggressive
increase in demand for foreign currency, resulting in deposit
withdrawls from banks,” she said.  The cabinet will avoid a “serious devaluation” by raising
natural-gas tariffs for households to unlock a $15.6 billion
loan from the  International Monetary Fund , according to
Golovach. The central bank will support the currency at 8.5 per
dollar “at least until the parliamentary elections” in October
next year, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
