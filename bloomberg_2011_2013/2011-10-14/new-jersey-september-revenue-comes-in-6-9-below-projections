New Jersey ’s September revenue
collections were 6.9 percent below budget projections after
 Hurricane Irene  delayed tax payments, Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-
Eristoff said in a statement.  Collections for the first three months of the fiscal year
are 3.6 percent under budget, Sidamon-Eristoff said today.
Taxpayers affected by the storm and the flooding were told they
could delay September tax payments until October.  The extension was “necessary and appropriate to aid
businesses and individuals impacted by the storm,” Sidamon-
Eristoff said in a statement.  Irene made landfall Aug. 27 in  North Carolina  and moved
north to the Mid-Atlantic states. In New Jersey, nine deaths
were confirmed and all 21 counties were declared eligible for
disaster assistance. Kinetic Analysis Corp. estimated the
economic loss at $2.1 billion.  The state collected $4.15 billion for the first three
months of fiscal 2012, compared with $4.30 billion budgeted.  The September total was $2.20 billion, compared with
$2.37 billion expected. Gross income revenue was down
10.6 percent, at $956.6 million and corporate business revenue
was down 7.2 percent, at $325.3 million. Sales taxes were off
4.6 percent, at $623.2 million.  The hurricane led to a three-day closure of Atlantic City
casinos, and related revenue was $17.5 million versus
$20.6 million budgeted.  To contact the reporter on this story:
