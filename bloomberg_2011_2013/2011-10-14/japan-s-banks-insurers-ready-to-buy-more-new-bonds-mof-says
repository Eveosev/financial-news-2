Japan ’s institutional investors say
the market can absorb additional government debt this fiscal
year as the government looks for ways to finance earthquake
reconstruction, according to a  Ministry of Finance  official.
　　Most of the participants, which include life insurance
companies and banks, expect the government to sell more debt
maturing in 1, 2, 5 and 10 years, the official told reporters
today, after meeting with the institutional investors. They
expect 100 billion yen ($1.3 billion) to 200 billion yen will be
added to each monthly auction of those maturities, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
　　Some investors indicated they have room to buy more super
long-term bonds, such as 20-year debt, according to the official.
　　The gathering follows a ministry meeting yesterday with the
25 primary dealers, who are obliged to bid at the government’s
sales. The dealers said they expect the government will issue
about 2 trillion yen of extra debt this year.
　　The  finance ministry  is gauging demand for bonds as it
compiles its third extra budget for the year started April 1 to
support an economy recovering from a record quake on March 11.
The ministry announced in December a plan to sell record 144.9
trillion yen of debt during fiscal 2011.
　　Japan’s 10-year bond yield fell half a basis point to 1.015
percent today, at Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest
interdealer debt broker.  To contact the reporter on this story:
