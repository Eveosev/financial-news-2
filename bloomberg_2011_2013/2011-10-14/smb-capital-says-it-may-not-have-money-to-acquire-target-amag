MSMB Capital Management, a  New York- 
based investment fund, said it may not have the financial
backing it needs for the attempted $378 million acquisition of
 AMAG Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMAG)   AMAG gained 2 percent to $14.68 at the close of trading in
New York. MSMB made an unsolicited bid to buy Lexington,
Massachusetts-based AMAG in August. It is opposing AMAG’s
attempt to buy  Allos Therapeutics Inc. (ALTH) , a Westminster, Colorado-
based biotechnology company.  “Although we expect to obtain financing from such lenders
on terms that we deem to be commercially reasonable, there can
be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on
commercially reasonable terms or at all,” MSMB said in a
statement filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  MSMB said that its $18-per-share offer for AMAG could be
modified. The filing is for an AMAG shareholders meeting on Oct.
21 where investors will be asked to vote on the Allos
acquisition.  Martin Shkreli, MSMB’s chief investment officer, declined
to comment on the filing.  Allos gained 4.8 percent to $1.52.  To contact the reporter on this story:
