Agrokor d.d.’s possible takeover of
 Mercator Poslovni Sistem (MELR)  d.d. of Slovenia would be a “positive
step” for both companies and their suppliers in the Balkans,
STA newswire  reported  citing Ivan Kustrak, the Croatian
company’s executive vice president for export markets.  “There is a long weekend ahead of us and the decision
should be taken by Monday,” Kustrak was quoted as saying by the
Slovenian newswire, when asked if Agrokor will submit its offer
for a majority of Mercator.  ING Bank NV, the adviser appointed by Slovenian banks and
other investors to sell just over 50 percent of Mercator,
probably will announce the list of companies that submitted non-
binding bids for the Slovenian supermarket chain on Oct. 17,
according to STA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
