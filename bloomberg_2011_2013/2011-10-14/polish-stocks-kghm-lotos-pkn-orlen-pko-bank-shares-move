Poland ’s WIG20 Index rose 28.23, or
1.2 percent, to close at 2,300.65 at 5:30 p.m. in Warsaw,
extending this week’s gain to 5 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, rose 2.5 percent to 146 zloty,
taking its gain so far this week to 7 percent. Copper advanced
on signals that demand remains steady in top global consumer
China.  PKN Orlen SA (PKN PW), Poland’s biggest oil company, gained
1.4 percent to 38.54 zloty and  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS)  , the
second-largest refiner, increased 1.1 percent to 27 zloty, its
third day of advances. Oil rose as a rescue plan for Europe’s
debt-laden economies took shape while better-than-forecast
retail sales allayed concerns that the  U.S. economy  is slowing.  PKO Bank Polski SA (PKO PW), Poland’s biggest bank, jumped
3.6 percent to 35.27 zloty, the highest close in more than a
month. HSBC Holdings Plc maintained its “overweight”
recommendation, saying the bank’s valuation is “attractive”
after a slump and that concerns about weaker earnings are
“exaggerated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
