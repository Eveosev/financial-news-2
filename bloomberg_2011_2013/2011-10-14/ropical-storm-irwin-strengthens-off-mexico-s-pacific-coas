Tropical Storm Irwin, once a
hurricane, strengthened slightly as it drifted over Pacific
waters west of  Mexico  on a track that will keep it away from
land the rest of the week, the  National Hurricane Center  said.  Irwin’s top winds rose to 45 miles (72 kilometers) per hour
from 40 mph as the system churned 185 miles west-southwest of
Manzanillo, Mexico, according to a center advisory at 5 p.m. New
York time. The storm is moving south at 5 mph.  The NHC also is tracking a system in the Caribbean off the
Yucatan Peninsula and  Honduras  with a 20 percent chance of
becoming a larger storm in the next two days. A second area of
disturbed weather near  Bermuda  probably won’t become a storm.  To contact the reporters on this story:
