Copper climbed, set for a second
weekly advance, after London Metal Exchange stockpiles decreased
to their lowest level in six months and a report showed that
inflation slowed in  China . Other base metals also increased.  The three-month contract gained as much as 2.8 percent to
$7,517 a metric ton on the LME and traded at $7,510 by 3 p.m.
Shanghai time. The contract is up 1.9 percent this week. Copper
for December delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange climbed
2.1 percent to 56,010 yuan ($8,781) a ton.  LME copper stockpiles fell to 453,100 tons as of yesterday,
the lowest level since April 19, daily exchange figures showed.
The decline was led by Asian warehouses, signaling rising
regional demand. China’s consumer prices increased 6.1 percent
in September from a year earlier, the National Bureau of
Statistics said today. That followed a 6.2 percent gain in
August.  “Inflation cooled down a bit, which together with falling
LME inventories and rising Chinese imports, provided temporary
relief to copper,” Wang Ning, an analyst at Xiangyu Futures
Co., said by phone from  Shanghai .  Chinese imports of unwrought copper and products rose to a
16-month high of 380,526 tons in September, the General
Administration of Customs said yesterday. The arrivals were 12
percent higher than August and grew 3.3 percent from a year ago.  Data showing inflation easing was “encouraging,” and
gives the government leeway to ease monetary policies,  Jing Ulrich , Hong Kong-based chairwoman of global markets for China
at JPMorgan Chase & Co said in a Bloomberg Television interview.  Canceled warrants, which are orders to draw metal from
inventories, last week climbed to 60,000 tons, the highest level
since May 2009. They were at 51,850 tons yesterday.  Aluminum gained 0.5 percent to $2,217.75 a ton, zinc added
1.3 percent to $1,948 a ton. Lead was little changed at
$2,037.50 a ton, nickel gained 1.1 percent to $18,661 a ton, and
tin climbed 2.3 percent to $22,500 a ton.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
