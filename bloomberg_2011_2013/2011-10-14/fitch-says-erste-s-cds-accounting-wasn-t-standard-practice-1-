Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ’s revised way of
accounting for credit-default swaps is already standard practice
elsewhere,  Fitch Ratings  said today.  Erste on Oct. 10 said it would categorise CDS it has sold
as derivatives because changes in accounting standards made it
impossible to keep them in its books as financial guarantees.
That change means that it must account for them at market
prices, which created a 180 million-euro ($249.5 million) loss
this year, the lender said.  “The practice of accounting for CDS as derivatives and
therefore marking them to market is well established across
Europe,” Bridget Gandy, co-head of Fitch’s European banks
division, said in a statement today.  Accounting and disclosure rules and conventions have become
one of the areas under scrutiny of investors and supervisors in
 Europe ’s debt crisis. The head of Europe’s markets regulator
last month warned banks to be consistent in their valuations of
sovereign debt, likening the lack of transparency about banks’
individual holdings of government debt to the sub-prime
mortgages that triggered the credit crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
