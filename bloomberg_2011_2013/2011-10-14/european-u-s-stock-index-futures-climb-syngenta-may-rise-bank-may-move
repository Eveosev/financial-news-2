European stocks climbed, extending
the Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s longest stretch of weekly gains in
six months, as Group of 20 finance ministers meet in Paris to
discuss the euro area’s debt crisis.  Syngenta AG (SYNN)  led chemical makers higher, rising more than 1
percent after posting third-quarter sales that beat analysts’
estimates.  SAP AG (SAP)  rallied 2.1 percent after the software maker
reported higher earnings. Xstrata Plc led mining shares higher
as copper rebounded in London.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.8 percent to 238.51 at the close in
London, extending its weekly advance to 2.8 percent for a third
week of gains amid optimism euro-area policy makers will contain
the region’s debt crisis. The gauge has still fallen 18 percent
from its high on Feb. 17.  “There is a better feel to the market,” said Paul Coffin,
a  fund manager  at Fieldings Investment Management Ltd. in
London. “Stock valuations are quite low and bonds are looking a
tad expensive. We’ve seen a good rally, but if  Europe  doesn’t
show a big enough gun, it could turn out to be a case of better
to travel than arrive.”  G-20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in Paris
today and tomorrow to outline a euro-area rescue plan that may
include deeper investor losses on Greek bonds and increased
firepower for the  International Monetary Fund . Leaders may
complete the plan at an Oct. 23 summit in Brussels to present to
a gathering of G-20 chiefs Nov. 3-4.  Spain  Credit Downgrade  Stocks climbed today even after  Standard & Poor’s 
downgraded Spain’s credit rating for the third time in three
years as slowing growth and rising defaults threaten banks.  The rating company reduced Spain’s ranking by one level to
AA-, S&P’s fourth-highest investment grade, with the outlook
remaining negative, in a statement late yesterday.  National benchmark indexes rose in all 18 western European
markets except Iceland and Denmark. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX) 
rose 1.2 percent and  Germany ’s DAX Index gained 0.9 percent.
 France ’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  advanced 1 percent.  Syngenta increased 1.3 percent to 268.20 Swiss francs after
the world’s largest maker of agricultural chemicals reported
third-quarter sales of $2.7 billion. That beat the average of
six analysts’ estimates of $2.5 billion. The company also said
momentum in sales volume continued into the fourth quarter with
no drop-off in orders.  Wacker Chemie AG rallied 3.3 percent to 76.01 euros.
Clariant AG, which said it raised 365 million euros ($506
million) by issuing three-year certificates, climbed 3 percent
to 9.69 francs. Yara International ASA advanced 3 percent to
250.40 kroner.  SAP, Xstrata Advance  SAP gained 2.1 percent to 41.40 euros after the largest
maker of business-management software said earnings and sales
rose in the third quarter on rising demand for its services.  Operating profit, based on non-international financial
reporting standards, rose 23 percent to 1.13 billion euros.
Sales on that basis increased 12 percent to 3.41 billion euros.  Xstrata led mining shares higher, climbing 3.1 percent to
974.1 pence.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  advanced 3.7 percent to 1,118 pence
and Rio Tinto Group gained 1.9 percent to 3,345.5 pence.  Copper rebounded in London, climbing as much as 3.7 percent
after customs figures yesterday showed imports of the metal into
 China , the world’s largest consumer, reached a 16-month high.
Zinc, tin and nickel also advanced.  BowLeven Plc (BLVN)  soared 60 percent to 120.75 pence, its biggest
gain since 2009, after the U.K.-listed oil explorer focused on
 Africa  said it discovered oil from an exploration well. The
Sapele-3 well in the Douala Basin at the Etinde permit
encountered 11 meters of net pay and the reservoir appears to be
of “good quality,” the company said.  Sulzer, UPM-Kymmene  Sulzer AG (SUN)  paced declining shares, falling 8.8 percent to
94.10 francs after the Swiss maker of pumps predicted a slowdown
in order growth for the full year as customers hesitate to
invest amid rising economic uncertainty.  UPM-Kymmene Oyj (UPM1V)  dropped 6.1 percent to 8.80 euros after
Europe’s second-largest papermaker reversed its full-year
earnings forecast and predicted operating profit will fall
rather than rise.  UPM said it cut its projection for operating profit
excluding one-off items because of declines in pulp and fine-
paper deliveries in Europe.  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  lost 1.4 percent to 5.32 euros after HSBC
Holdings Plc lowered its recommendation for  Italy ’s biggest
military contractor to “underweight” from “neutral.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
