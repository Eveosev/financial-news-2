Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) ,
the world’s largest generic drugmaker, completed its acquisition
of  Cephalon Inc. (CEPH)  after it agreed to sell off a generic version
of Cephalon’s biggest product, Provigil.  The divestment of a generic version of modafinil, the
active ingredient in the narcolepsy treatment Provigil, “will
allow a competitor to emerge and compete effectively” with the
combined company, the European Commission said in an e-mailed
statement today. Teva and Cephalon said yesterday that they won
EU approval.  EU antitrust regulators are separately investigating Teva
and Cephalon over a 2005 agreement that may have delayed generic
versions of Provigil.  Teva, based in Petach Tikvah,  Israel , agreed in May to buy
Cephalon in a deal valued at $6.8 billion including assumed
debt. The acquisition will help Teva offset the revenue it may
lose as its top-selling product, the multiple-sclerosis drug
Copaxone, faces competition from generic versions and new
branded products.  The deal will add to earnings within the fourth quarter
after closing, Teva said. Excluding costs linked to
acquisitions, the acquisition will add to earnings immediately.  Acino Holding AG (ACIN)   said today  that it agreed to buy the
Middle Eastern and African business of Cephalon for 60 million
euros ($83 million) in cash and 20 million euros of new shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
