Irwin, once a hurricane, is drifting
over Pacific waters west of  Mexico  on a track that will keep the
tropical storm away from land the rest of the week, the  National
Hurricane Center  said.  Irwin, with winds of 45 miles (75 kilometers) per hour, is
165 miles west of Manzanillo, Mexico, according to a 2 a.m.
Pacific Daylight Time advisory. Little change in strength is
expected today, with slow weakening likely tomorrow, the NHC
said.  Hurricane Jova struck near Manzanillo earlier this week,
killing at least six people. Irwin had been downgraded to a
tropical depression only to re-emerge as a tropical storm today.  The NHC also is tracking a  system  in the Caribbean off the
Yucatan Peninsula and  Honduras  that has a 20 percent chance of
developing within two days and a low about 450 miles west-
southwest of the Bahamas that’s given a 10 percent chance of
developing into a tropical cyclone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
