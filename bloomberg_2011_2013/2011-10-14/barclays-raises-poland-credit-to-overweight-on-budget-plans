Barclays Capital  recommended
investors have “overweight” holdings in Polish credit and sell
the country’s five-year credit default swaps as the new
government will carry out plans to shrink the  budget deficit  and
secure its current rating.  Investors should sell Polish default swaps versus the
Markit iTraxx SovX CEEMEA Index of credit-default swaps for
eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to Piotr Chwiejczak, Koon Chow and Andreas Kolbe, strategist at Barclays
in London, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
