Asos Plc (ASC) , the U.K.’s second-largest
online clothing retailer, said U.K. sales growth slowed in the
fiscal second-quarter as sluggish consumer sentiment weighed on
its young shoppers.  Sales in the U.K. rose 1 percent to 44.1 million pounds
($70 million) in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with
a year earlier, the London-based retailer said today in a
statement. That compares with the 5 percent median estimate of
three analysts compiled by Bloomberg and 15 percent growth in
the first quarter. Revenue at its international unit rose 141
percent, less than the 160 percent growth in the first quarter.  Asos Chief Executive Officer Nick Robertson is starting
more country-specific websites like Australia, Spain and  Italy 
and has added iPhone and iPad applications to lure more 16- to
34-year-old shoppers. The retailer, which ships to 160
countries, is suffering as U.K. consumer confidence slumps on
high inflation and low wage growth.  “With costs and stock tightly managed and retail margin
ahead of prior year, we are confident of achieving results in
line with market expectations,” the CEO said in the statement.  Asos slipped 55 pence, or 3.5 percent, to 1,506 pence in
 London  trading yesterday. The stock has lost 5.4 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
