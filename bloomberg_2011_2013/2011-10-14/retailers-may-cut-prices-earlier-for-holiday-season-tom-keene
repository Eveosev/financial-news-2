U.S. retailers are expected to cut
prices earlier this holiday season to lure shoppers amid high
unemployment and cautious  consumer spending , according to Dana Telsey, founder and analyst at Telsey Advisory Group.  “The theme of holiday 2011 is going to be called planned
promotion,” Telsey said today in a radio interview with
“Bloomberg Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “Since we have seen
sales numbers that are volatile, retailers will want to get
their head start early.”  Retailers remain cautious amid stock market volatility and
the 9.1 percent unemployment rate. Consumer spending slowed in
August as incomes dropped for the first time in almost two
years. Purchases rose 0.2 percent after a 0.7 percent increase
the prior month, Commerce Department figures showed Sept. 30.  Telsey predicts holiday retail sales to rise 4 percent this
year, “a little bit better” than the forecast of a 3 percent
gain by ShopperTrak, a Chicago-based consulting firm.  Retail sales rose in September by the most in seven months,
as purchases grew 1.1 percent, exceeding the median forecast of
85 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, Commerce Department
data showed today in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
