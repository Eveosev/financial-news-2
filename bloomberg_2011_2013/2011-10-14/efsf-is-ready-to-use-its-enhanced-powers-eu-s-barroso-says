European Commission President  Jose
Barroso  said euro-area rescue fund is now “ready” to use its
expanded powers after Slovakia’s lawmakers backed the enhanced
European Financial Stability Facility yesterday.  “Slovakia has voted the package, so this fund is already
operational,” Barroso said today in Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire,
 France . “We must optimize the efficiency by leverage effects.”  The EFSF has gained the power to buy sovereign bonds on the
secondary and primary markets, offer credit lines to governments
and grant aid for bank recapitalizations. The EFSF’s role up to
now has been to sell bonds to finance rescue loans.  Barroso reiterated his call for “coordinated action”
across  Europe  to recapitalize banks and said the requirement
“before any bank recapitalization is that they must stop
distributing dividends or bonuses. This is something citizens
would not understand if they see the considerable sums used for
support banks,” he said. He also repeated his demand for a tax
on financial transactions, saying “the financial sector must
also give a contribution.”  Barroso, who travels to Paris later today to meet with
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy , called on officials to work
together with European Union institutions to solve the debt
crisis.   “We must do more together,” Barroso said. “Nothing can
bring results in Europe without a close cooperation between
France and  Germany ; we all know that. But at the same time, we
must work together with our institutions, it’s the only way to
have all the other states follow us.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
