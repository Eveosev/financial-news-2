Premiums for Middle East oil sold to
 Asia  rose for a third day as refiners increased their purchases
of distillate-rich grades.  Qatar Marine for loading in December climbed 9 cents to a
premium of 37 cents over its official selling price, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi
National Oil Co., rose 1 cent to a premium of 17 cents.  Refiners in Northeast Asia are seeking to maximize their
output of gasoil and kerosene before the winter heating season.
Qatar Marine yields about 14 percent of kerosene after basic
processing, more than the 9.6 percent from Arab Light, a typical
Middle East grade. Murban produces about 18 percent.  Dubai swaps for November widened to a premium of $1.74 a
barrel today compared with January, according to data from
London-based brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd. Thatâ€™s up from
$1.39 a week ago. This market situation known as backwardation
suggests demand is greater for immediate shipments.  Oman crude for immediate loading increased $2.08, or 2
percent, to $106.24 a barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Dubai oil
for loading in December rose 2 percent to $103.68. Murban for
spot delivery climbed 1.9 percent to $110.52.  Oman futures for December delivery rose $1.80 to $107.75 a
barrel on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange at 5:53 p.m. Singapore
time with 1,079 contracts traded. The settlement price was
$106.85 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The December Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker contract against the Persian Gulf grade,
narrowed 57 cents to $6.08 a barrel, said PVM. The exchange for
swaps for January fell 26 cents to $5.12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
