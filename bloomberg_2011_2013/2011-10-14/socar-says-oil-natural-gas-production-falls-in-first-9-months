Socar, the State Oil Co. of
 Azerbaijan , pumped less oil and natural gas in the first nine
months of the year, the Baku-based company said today.  Oil output declined 2.2 percent to 6.65 million metric tons
from a year earlier, and gas production dropped 5 percent to
5.46 billion cubic meters, Socar said in a report on its
 website , without giving a reason.  Socar has recorded declining oil output since 2009, when
the company produced 6.84 million tons of oil. First Vice
President Xosbaxt Yusifzada earlier this year blamed the drop on
aging wells.  Socar also said it exported 1.78 million tons of oil during
the nine-month period, a decline of 11 percent from a year
earlier. Gas exports climbed 60 percent to 2.07 billion cubic
meters.  Azerbaijan exports gas to  Russia , Iran, Georgia, Turkey and
 Greece .  To contact the reporter on this story:
