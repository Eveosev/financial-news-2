China  is gravely concerned about the
potential passage of U.S. legislation letting companies seek
duties to compensate for an undervalued yuan, Vice Premier Li Keqiang said, according to Xinhua News Agency.  Politicizing economic and trade issues can only harm China-
U.S. ties and obstruct the global recovery, Li told visiting
former U.S. Secretary of State  Condoleezza Rice  today, according
to the state-run news agency.  Li also called on the U.S. to bear in mind the overall
interests of bilateral relations, respect China’s core interests
and grave concerns and properly handle sensitive issues, Xinhua
reported.  The currency bill, passed by the U.S. Congress this week,
will now move to the House of Representatives.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
