Olympus Corp. (7733)  Chairman Tsuyoshi
Kikukawa said ousted President Michael C. Woodford did not focus
on bringing employees together toward a common goal.  Kikukawa, who becomes president of the Tokyo-based company,
 told reporters today that Woodford created “gaps” in
management and the situation would have caused trouble if
allowed to continue. Woodford could not be reached immediately
for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
