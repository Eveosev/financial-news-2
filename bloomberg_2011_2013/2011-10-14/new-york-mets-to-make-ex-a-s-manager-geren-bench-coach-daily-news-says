The  New York Mets  agreed to hire
former Oakland Athletics manager Bob Geren as bench coach as the
team rebuilds its staff following a third consecutive losing
season, the Daily News reported.  The Mets made an offer yesterday to the 50-year-old Geren,
the newspaper reported today, citing a person it didn’t identify
who was familiar with the negotiations. Geren was fired by the
Athletics in June, having spent four and a half seasons with the
team that current Mets general manager Sandy Alderson ran from
1983 to 1998.  Mets spokesman  Jay Horwitz  declined in an e-mail to comment
on the report.  The Mets finished the season 77-85 and have made the
playoffs once in the last 11 years. On Oct. 5 the team announced
that it had fired four coaches, including bench coach Ken Oberkfell.  Geren was 334-376 with no playoff appearances during his
tenure in Oakland, and was the bench coach for the Arizona
Diamondbacks when they won the  World Series  in 2001. He played
four seasons as a catcher with the  New York Yankees  from
1988-1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
