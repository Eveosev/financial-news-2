Regulators should proceed with plans
to collect and store data on all U.S. securities trading, an
initiative that is “absolutely critical” to keeping markets
fair,  NYSE Euronext (NYX) ’s chief operating officer said.  After the May 2010 crash that erased $862 billion in 20
minutes, the Securities and Exchange Commission and stock
markets implemented circuit breakers last year to prevent
volatility in individual companies from spreading throughout the
market. The SEC said this year that it might mandate a system
that limits moves in securities prices.  “Limit-up and limit-down, that solves some of the problem,
but in my view that’s not enough,”  Larry Leibowitz , the chief
operating officer of the New York Stock Exchange’s owner, said
at a Society of American Business Editors and Writers conference
in New York today. “The SEC proposal to create centralized
audit trail is absolutely critical so we can say someone is
surveilling across all markets,” he said. “It’s our job as an
industry and the exchanges in particular to stand up for
transparency and integrity.”  Regulators and exchanges are reviewing plans to improve
surveillance of trading activity after the rout on May 6, 2010.
Leibowitz said today that the so-called flash crash was a
“crystallization of the problems that had been occurring in the
marketplace for years.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
