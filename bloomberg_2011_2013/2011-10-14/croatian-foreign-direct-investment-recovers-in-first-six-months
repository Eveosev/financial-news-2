Croatian foreign direct investment
rose to 485 million euros ($668 million) in the first six months
from $583 million in 2010, the  central bank  said in a statement
late yesterday.  Croatia , which is preparing to become the  European Unionâ€™s 
28th member in July 2013, is still struggling to recover from a
two-year recession. The economy expanded 0.8 percent in the
second quarter from a year earlier, after a 0.8 percent
contraction in the first three months. The foreign direct
investment totaled $6 billion in 2008, the last pre-crisis year.  To contact the reporter responsible for the story: Jasmina
