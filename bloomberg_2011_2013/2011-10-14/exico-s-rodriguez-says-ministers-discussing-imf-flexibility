Mexican Deputy Finance Minister
 Gerardo Rodriguez  said ministers are in “ongoing” discussions
about making the International Monetary Fund more flexible.  “The crisis requires a stronger IMF, one that is well
resourced, one that has more flexibility of its toolkit and one
that has a stronger surveillance mandate,” he said in an
interview with Bloomberg Television in Paris.  He declined to give details on the size of any increase in
the fund’s resources.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
