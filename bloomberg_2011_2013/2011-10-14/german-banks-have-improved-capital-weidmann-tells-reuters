Bundesbank PresidentJens Weidmann
said that German banks’ capital positions have considerably
improved over the past months, Reuters reported.  “The earnings situation in the first half of this year was
such that buffers could be built for turbulent times,”
Weidmann, who is also a council member at the  European Central
Bank , told Reuters in the interview published today. “We need
to curb the channel of uncertainty” regarding banks’
resilience, he said, adding that “the knowledge of a strong
capital position of banks is crucial.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
