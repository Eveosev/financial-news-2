European Central Bank Executive
Board member Juergen Stark called for creating a European Budget
Office that may become the “nucleus” of ECB President Jean- Claude Trichet’s proposed euro-area  finance ministry .  The independent body could start on an “informal basis,”
without requiring a treaty change, Stark said in an interview
broadcast on Latvian radio today. The office will be charged
with “close monitoring of budget developments” and execution
among the bloc’s member states and providing independent advice
to policy makers, he said.  “This could be the nucleus of a European finance
ministry,” Stark said. “This in the end has to be based on a
treaty change, to have the power to interfere in the national
budget procedures, otherwise you will never get the fiscal
discipline which is required for the smooth functioning of
monetary union.”  Europe ’s leaders are intensifying efforts to contain the
crisis that broke out in  Greece  almost two years ago and drove
up state borrowing costs from Ireland to  Italy . Trichet has
advocated a “major strengthening” of the monetary union’s
fiscal ties earlier this year to help overcome the region’s debt
turmoil, proposing a euro-area finance minister to monitor
policy making.  “We are now in a situation in which we need more Europe,”
Stark said. “More Europe means to transform or to transport
national sovereignty to a supranational level.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
