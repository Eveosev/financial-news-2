Wenzhou , a small coastal town 300 miles southeast of  Shanghai , is home to a booming  export market  of cheap goods such as lighters, sex toys, eyeglass frames and fake Gucci bags. For years, the town has been known for its ambitious entrepreneurs. In 1979, the Chinese government granted  Zhang Huamei  a business license, making her China’s first, post-Cultural Revolution government-approved entrepreneur. She quickly became rich by using cheap labor to manufacture buttons and is known in some circles as “Capitalist Number One.” Others followed her lead, quickly amassing their own fortunes. Many Wenzhou business people then took their excess cash to the real estate market. They bought up entire floors, and sometimes blocks, of new high-rises in  China 's cities. In search of even higher returns, some of them turned into unregulated money lenders to other real estate investors. For a while, this system worked beautifully for the Wenzhou business class: Ever-rising skylines produced ever-rising income. But housing prices  soared , and Wenzhou's entrepreneurs were among the culprits China's urban residents blamed for the inflation. Few problems unnerve the Communist Party more than inflation. In January 2010, Beijing ordered its banks to restrict access to credit.  Easy credit  had allowed people in Wenzhou, and their like-minded investors across China, to finance their inflation-inducing real estate buying binges. But as Beijing tightened credit, private companies and local government officials in Wenzhou bucked the orders of the party and  Central Bank  and  began to lend  money to newly cash-strapped Wenzhou entrepreneurs at usurious rates that, reportedly, ran as high as 140 percent per annum. In other words, some of Wenzhou’s business people and government officials began moonlighting as loan sharks. In late September, a large numbers of Wenzhou entrepreneurs either  went into hiding  or fled China entirely. What did they fear? According to news reports, they  feared  the employees and suppliers they could no longer pay -- and their loan shark creditors. On Oct. 5, sensing a financial and social crisis, Premier  Wen Jiabao  visited Wenzhou and  promised  state-administered loans for small and medium-sized businesses struggling to obtain financing in the wake of the national credit tightening. But the Chinese public perceived this to be an official state bailout just for Wenzhou, a city filled with corrupt and irresponsible businesses and civil servants. In the past week, the credit crisis deepened. The party’s answer was to  extend the bailout  even further to  include  companies beyond Wenzhou that had also skirted the formal banking system. To many in the Chinese public, this event symbolized a systemic government failure and a major shortcoming in Chinese society. It  inspired  China's microbloggers to stop tweeting about movies, pop stars and online games and express their strong populist reaction to the ever-increasing bailout of corrupt companies. At times, Chinese microbloggers' reactions echoed populist U.S. reaction to the Wall Street bailouts. “Socialism has advantages,” wrote a microblogger named  Shi Bo , on the Sina Weibo microblog. “When businessmen take speculative losses, all the people will pay for them.” But businessmen, financial commentators and economic analysts have also expressed varying degrees of disgust with the bailouts.  Ma Guangyuan , a well-known financial commentator tweeted on Sina: Xu Xiaonan, a professor at Shanghai's  China Europe International Business School , offered a roundabout answer to Ma’s question with his own  tweet : Chinese mainstream media commentators have detected similarities between American and Chinese populist frustration over financial bailouts. And many of them fear that financial disruption will lead to social disruption. Thus, China's financial media have taken a serious interest in the current Occupy  Wall Street  movement in the U.S., and some see lessons to be learned. On Oct. 10, Yu Fenghui explicitly listed those lessons in the National Business Daily. He  wrote : Few state media pundits, however, have had the courage to hold party corruption responsible for the Wenzhou crisis. Shen Bin is a lone stand-out in this regard. He  wrote  in Shanghai’s popular Oriental Morning Post: Shen’s solution, as outlined in the editorial, was simple: Start enforcing regulations that would prevent local government officials from moonlighting as street corner bankers. But he didn't express much confidence in the likelihood of reform. There’s considerable speculation in the Chinese press that the Wenzhou credit crisis is just the beginning of a U.S.-style credit meltdown that will spread throughout China. Xiao Yong, a writer with Hubei Daily, a state-owned paper in Wuhan, actually  suggested  parallels to 1930s America in an Oct. 11 editorial: Xiao reminded readers that “it’s only getting worse” and listed additional provinces to which the Wenzhou-style credit crisis has expanded: Jiangsu, Fujian, Henan and Inner Mongolia. A Sina microblogger with the handle _samuel,  echoed  this sense of impending doom caused by Wenzhou with this pithy observation: Few populists, in the U.S. or China, would disagree.
