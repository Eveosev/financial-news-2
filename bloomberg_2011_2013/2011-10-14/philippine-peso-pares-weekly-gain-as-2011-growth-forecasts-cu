The Philippine peso completed second
week of gains after the government announced plans to boost
spending and offered to buy back up to $1.5 billion of debt.  President  Benigno Aquino  unveiled a 72.1 billion peso ($1.7
billion) economic stimulus on Oct. 12, a day after the
statistics office reported that exports slumped in August by the
most since September 2009. The government this week offered to
buy as much as $1.5 billion of foreign-currency debt as part of
managing its liabilities.  “The government has pledged to boost spending, inflation
is stable and fiscal and debt consolidation is supportive of
positive sentiment on the peso on the medium-term,” said
Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in  Singapore .  The peso rose 0.4 percent this week to 43.355 per dollar at
the close in Manila, according to Bankers Association of the
 Philippines . The currency was little changed today and reached
43.13 yesterday, the strongest level since Sept. 14.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will probably keep its
benchmark  interest rate  at 4.5 percent at its policy meeting on
Oct. 20, according to all 13 economists in a Bloomberg News
survey. It maintained the rate at the past three meetings.  Government bonds  fell today. The yield on the 5.875 percent
notes maturing in January 2018 rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 5.20 percent, according to Tradition
Financial Services. It climbed 10 basis points this week.  The nation has so far sold about 55 billion pesos of 10-
and 15-year bonds to individual investors before the sale closes
on Oct. 17, First Metro Investment Corp. President Roberto
Juanchito Dispo said today. The government sold more than 100
billion pesos of retail bonds in March.  “Market sentiment was affected after the sale of retail
treasury bonds because the coupons were not so attractive,”
said Larry Gutierrez, a fixed-income trader at Philippine Bank
of Communications in  Manila .  To contact the reporter on this story:
