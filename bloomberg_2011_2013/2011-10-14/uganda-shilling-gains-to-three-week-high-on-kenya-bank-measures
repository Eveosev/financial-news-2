Uganda ’s shilling climbed to a
three-week high against the dollar, extending its gain this week
as Kenya, its biggest trading partner, imposed limits on banks’
foreign-currency operations to bolster its currency.  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy
appreciated as much as 1 percent to 2,820, the strongest level
since Sept. 22, and traded 0.4 percent up at 2,836 by 1:16 p.m.
in the capital, Kampala, taking its advance this month to 1
percent. The currency has lost 19 percent this year.  The foreign-exchange exposure limit for commercial banks
was lowered to 10 percent of core capital from 20 percent,
Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said yesterday. The announcement
is part of a set of measures to boost the  Kenya ’s currency,
which has lost 20 percent this year and is the world’s worst
performer.  “The Ugandan shilling is following that of Kenya,” Denis
Mashanyu, a currency trader at Standard Chartered Bank Uganda
Ltd., said by phone from Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. “There is
correlation with the stance taken by Central Bank of Kenya’s
restriction in offshore participation and cutting down on
positions that can be run by banks.”  Uganda’s shilling reached 2,897.50 on Sept. 23, the weakest
since June 1993. A surge in food and fuel prices pushed
inflation to a more than 18-year high of 28.3 percent this month
from 21.4 percent in August, the Uganda Bureau of Statistics
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
