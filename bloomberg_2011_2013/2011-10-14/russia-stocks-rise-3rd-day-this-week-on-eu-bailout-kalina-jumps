Russian stocks had their best weekly
gain in more than 1 1/2 years as oil and metals rallied on bets
Europe’s debt crisis will be contained. OAO Concern Kalina, a
cosmetics maker, jumped to its highest on record.  OAO Gazprom,  Russia ’s gas export monopoly, rose 2.9
percent. OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest lender, surged 7.6
percent. Kalina increased 40 percent to the strongest price
since its shares started trading in 2004 after Unilever agreed
to acquire the company. The 30-stock Micex Index added 3.1
percent to 1,431.92 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, giving it
a weekly gain of 6 percent, the biggest since March 2010.  Oil climbed as much as 3.6 percent, rallying with equity
markets as Group of 20 and International Monetary Fund officials
said the Washington-based lender may increase resources to help
stem the European debt crisis. U.S. retail sales climbed more
than forecast last month, data showed today.  “The market is really reassured because it looks they are
doing something to address the European debt crisis,” Bruce Bower, a partner at Moscow-based hedge fund Verno Capital, said
by phone. “We were falling before because of the fear that
nothing was going to be done.”  Russia’s  trade  with EU countries accounted for $453.6
billion, or almost half of the country’s total foreign trade
turnover in January through July 2011, according to Russia’s
Federal Service of State Statistics.  Cheapest Stocks  Russian stocks are the cheapest among the so-called BRIC
nations, with shares in the Micex trading at an average 5 times
analysts’ earnings estimates, compared with a price-to-earnings
ratio of 9.6 for stocks in  Brazil ’s Bovespa index, 11.2 for the
Shanghai Composite Index and 14.5 for the BSE India Sensitive
Index. The Micex is down 15 percent this year.  Slovakia’s lawmakers backed the European Financial
Stability Facility yesterday, after parliament had failed to
approve the measures on Oct. 11. The expanded powers of the 440

debt of stressed euro-area nations, aid troubled banks in the
region and offer credit lines to governments. Russia sells
commodities, including natural gas, oil and base metals, to

to $110.65. OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil producer,
added 2.5 percent to 1,708.50 rubles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
