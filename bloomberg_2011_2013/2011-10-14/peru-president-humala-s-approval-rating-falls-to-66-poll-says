Peruvian President  Ollanta Humala ’s
approval rating fell to 66 percent this month from 70 percent in
September,  Gestion  reported, citing a survey by Datum
Internacional.  Of those questioned, 51 percent expect Humala, who took
office July 28, to seek a second term in 2016, while 55 percent
said the first lady Nadine Heredia may run for the presidency,
the Lima-based newspaper reported. Humala has denied any plans
to change the constitution to allow him to run for a second
term.  Datum Internacional, a Lima-based researcher, questioned
1,208 people from Oct. 5 to Oct. 8, Gestion said. The nationwide
poll has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
