Canadian Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  said raising additional resources for the  International
Monetary Fund  should not become the focus of a solution to the
European debt crisis.  Flaherty, speaking to reporters in Paris ahead of a meeting
of policy makers from the Group of 20 countries, said officials
need to avoid focusing on non-central issues such as new funding
for the IMF. He said that some countries are pushing for a
larger role for the Washington-based institution.  Flaherty also said the statement that the G-20 will release
after tomorrow’s meeting is not likely to be very different from
a statement issued last month. One change he’d like to see would
be to add “moderate” language on foreign-exchange flexibility,
Flaherty said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
