The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan preliminary October index of consumer sentiment fell to
57.5 from 59.4 a month earlier, the group reported today.  The median forecast of 73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News was 60.2, and estimates ranged from 57 to 64. The index
averaged 89 in the five years leading up to the recession that
began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.  Retail sales rose more than forecast in September, easing
concern that pessimism and scant hiring will derail the biggest
part of the economy, another report showed today.  The 1.1 percent advance, the biggest since February,
followed a 0.3 percent gain for August, a stronger performance
than previously estimated, according to the Commerce Department
in  Washington . The median forecast of 85 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a 0.7 percent rise in purchases last month.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
