Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s largest maker of  luxury vehicles , is investing more than
1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in production of the overhauled
3-Series model.  The entry-level sedan, which debuted today in Munich, will
be built at two factories in  Germany  and one in  South Africa ,
the manufacturer of BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce models said in a
statement.  BMW’s best-selling car will reach markets worldwide on
February 11 and will start at 35,350 euros for the diesel-
powered 320d, 1,050 euros more than the current version. BMW
plans a hybrid variant from the fall of 2012.  “The new BMW 3-Series has excellent prospects for
expanding its leading global market position,” Chief Executive
