Doug Cliggott, whose bearish stock
calls from last year were proving more accurate in 2011, is no
longer the U.S. equity strategist for  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter.  Cliggott is still employed by Zurich-based Credit Suisse,
according to the people, who asked not to be identified because
the information isn’t public. The former  fund manager  has
usually had the lowest forecast for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index among strategists since Bloomberg began tracking him in
September 2010, when his year-end forecast was 1,075, which
proved the least accurate.  Steven Vames, a New York-based spokesman for the firm,
declined to comment. Cliggott, who turns 55 this month, didn’t
respond to e-mail and telephone messages seeking a response.  Credit Suisse hired Cliggott in October 2009 and he became
one of two voices who made  S&P 500  forecasts. The other, global
equity strategist  Andrew Garthwaite , is more bullish with a 2011
price forecast of 1,180.  Cliggott, who is based in  Boston , reduced his year-end
estimate for the S&P 500 in 2011 to 1,100 from 1,275 on Aug. 22.
The benchmark gauge for U.S. equities has fallen close to the
1,100-level three times this year and slid to 1,099.23 last
week. The S&P 500 has rallied 11 percent since, climbing to
1,224.58 yesterday.  Cliggott was too bearish during the  bull market  in 2009 and
2010. While at Dover, he said in May 2009 that stocks had gone
“too far, too fast” after jumping 34 percent from a 12-year
low in March. The measure went on to advance another 23 percent
through the end of the year.  In January 2010, he said the S&P 500 would be unchanged for
the year. The index added 13 percent to 1,257.64. His year-end
estimate in September 2010 was 1,075, the lowest in a Bloomberg
survey.  Cliggott, a Massachusetts native, worked at JPMorgan Chase
& Co. for six years before leaving in 2002 to run Stockholm-
based Brummer & Partners Kapitalfoervaltning AB’s U.S. research
office in  New York . He joined Dover Management LLC in 2007 as
chief investment officer after working for Race Point Asset
Management LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
