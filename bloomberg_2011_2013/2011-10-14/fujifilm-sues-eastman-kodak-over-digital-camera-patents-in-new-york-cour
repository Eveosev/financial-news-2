Fujifilm Corp. sued  Eastman Kodak
Co. (EK) , alleging that it infringed patents for digital cameras.  Fujifilm, based in Tokyo, sued Eastman Kodak over four
digital-camera patents after talks between the companies were
unsuccessful, according to a complaint filed today in federal
court in Manhattan.  Kodak manufactured and sold products in the U.S., including
the EasyShare C340 and EasyShare M530 digital cameras, that
violated the patents, Fujifilm alleged in the complaint. It
seeks damages and a jury trial.  Christopher Veronda, a spokesman for Rochester, New York-
based Kodak, didnâ€™t immediately return messages seeking comment
on the suit.  The case is Fujifilm Corp. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 1:11-cv-
07247, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
