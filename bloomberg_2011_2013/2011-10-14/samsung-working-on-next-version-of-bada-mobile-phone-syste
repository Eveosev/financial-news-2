Samsung Electronics Co. is working
on the next version of its Bada mobile-phone operating system,
an executive said, as the maker of Galaxy phones looks to offer
the software as an alternative to  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android.  “It must continue to evolve,” Lee Ho Soo, head of
Samsung’s Mobile Solutions Center, said in an interview
yesterday at the World Knowledge Forum in Seoul. “We’re doing a
lot of things to provide more for users of Bada-based phones.”  Samsung is turning to Bada as Google aims to buy Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc., a deal that could reduce the Android
owner’s dependence on hardware suppliers including Samsung.
Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung has benefited from the
popularity of Android as it looks to challenge  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  in the
smartphone market.  The latest version of Bada, unveiled in February, includes
mobile-payment support and other new features. Lee said the
company hasn’t decided when it will introduce a new version of
Bada or how much the software will change.  Samsung is also developing voice-recognition technology
that could be used for features similar to Apple’s Siri service,
Lee said.  Siri, which is included in Apple’s new iPhone 4S, lets
users ask for weather updates, make calendar appointments or
send messages by voice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
