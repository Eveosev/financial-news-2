Luxembourg’s Prime MinisterJean- Claude Juncker said European politicians will have to consider
forcing investors to write down their Greek sovereign debt
holdings should their contribution be insufficient.  Juncker, who spoke in an interview with German radio
station Deutschlandfunk today, said he doesn’t want to “weigh
down” talks to be held with bank representatives next week with
comments on the possible outcome.  The Luxembourgish politician leads the group of euro-area
finance ministers.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
