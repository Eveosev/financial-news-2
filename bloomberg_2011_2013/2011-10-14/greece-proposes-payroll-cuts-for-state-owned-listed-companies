Greek lawmakers will vote next week
on forcing state-controlled publicly listed companies to reduce
their wage bill to 65 percent of their 2009 level.  The measure will be included as an amendment to an
austerity bill to be voted on in parliament before a European
Union leaders’ summit on Oct. 23, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos told a parliament committee in  Athens  yesterday. The
legislation includes a number of measures that need to be
approved by lawmakers before disbursement of a sixth loan under
last year’s 110 billion-euro ($152 billion) EU-led bailout.  Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE)  will be exempt from the law, which
will affect companies including  Opap SA (OPAP) ,  Europe ’s biggest listed
gambling company,  Public Power Corp SA (PPC)  and  Piraeus Port
Authority (PPA)  SA, Kathimerini reported today, citing the legislation.  Venizelos and Prime Minister  George Papandreou  have said
that parliamentary approval of the legislation and next year’s
budget before the EU summit will help Greece in “difficult”
loan negotiations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
