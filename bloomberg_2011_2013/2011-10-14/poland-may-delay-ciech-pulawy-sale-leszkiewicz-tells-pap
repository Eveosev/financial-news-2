Poland’s Treasury Ministry will wait
until market conditions improve before proceeding with the sale
of state-owned stakes in two publicly traded chemical companies,
 Zaklady Azotowe Pulawy SA (ZAP)  and  Ciech SA (CIE) , PAP newswire reported
late yesterday, citing Deputy Treasury Minister Adam
Leszkiewicz.  The ministry’s plan to raise 15 billion zloty ($4.81
billion) from asset sales this year is not at risk, Leszkiewicz
said, according to PAP.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
