Chinese economic data showing
inflation easing in September from the previous month was
“encouraging,” and gives the government leeway to ease
monetary policies, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The government will introduce more policies to boost
economic growth as exports slump,  Jing Ulrich , Hong Kong-based
chairman of global markets for  China  at JPMorgan, said in a
Bloomberg Television interview. The yuan will appreciate a
further 2 percent against the U.S. dollar this year and 5
percent next year, she said. Ulrich favors industries such as
consumer, telecom, Internet and travel. She said bank and
property stocks face continued “downward pressure.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
