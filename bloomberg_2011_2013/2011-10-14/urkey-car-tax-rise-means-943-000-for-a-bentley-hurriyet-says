Turkey is increasing special
consumption taxes for cars, which is likely to raise the cost of
 luxury vehicles  by 25 percent,  Hurriyet  reported.  An increase from 84 percent to 130 percent in the  tax rate 
for vehicles with motors larger than two liters is likely to
mean losses for distributors of luxury vehicles such as Audi and
BMW that have significant inventory, the newspaper said.  A Bentley Mulsanne will now cost $943,000 in Turkey,
Hurriyet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
