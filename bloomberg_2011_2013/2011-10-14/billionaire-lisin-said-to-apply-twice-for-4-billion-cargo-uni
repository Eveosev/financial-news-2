Billionaire  Vladimir Lisin  applied
twice to bid in an auction for a $4 billion stake in state-owned
OAO Russian Railways’ Freight One cargo unit, to ensure the sale
goes ahead, said two people with knowledge of the plans.  Two of Lisin’s companies applied to bid, as did billionaire
energy trader  Gennady Timchenko ’s OOO Transoil and ZAO
Neftetransservice, owned by Vadim and Vyacheslav Aminov, the
people said, declining to be identified because of
confidentiality issues.  Russian Railways is offering almost 75 percent of Freight
One at a starting price of 125 billion rubles ($4 billion) in an
Oct. 28 auction. Applications close today. All four bidders paid
the refundable 5 billion-ruble entry fee, the people said.  The parallel applications, filed by units of Lisin’s UCL
Holding transportation company, were a way to ensure the auction
isn’t canceled for lack of multiple bids, the people said.  Dmitry Baukov, a spokesman for UCL Holding, confirmed the
company had applied. He declined to comment on a double bid.
Timchenko’s Transoil confirmed its application in an Oct. 10
statement. Natalya Dryzhak, a spokeswoman for Neftetransservice,
didn’t immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
