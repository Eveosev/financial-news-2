Bank of England interim Financial
Policy Committee member Robert Jenkins said  Greece  must default
on its debt within the euro area as a default outside the
monetary union may cause bank lending to slump and damage
Europe’s economy.  A “Greek default within the euro is manageable and will be
managed,” Jenkins, also an adjunct professor of finance at the
 London Business School , wrote in an  article  published on the
website of the Financial News today. “Greek default outside the
euro involves risk to a different order of magnitude.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
