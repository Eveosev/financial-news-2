Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization SA (HTO) , Greece’s largest phone company, had its  credit
rating  cut by  Standard & Poor’s  as a deteriorating Greek economy
adds pressure on the company to refinance maturing debt.  The ranking for the company, known as OTE, was reduced by
two levels to B from BB-, with the outlook remaining negative,
the rating company said in a statement today.  OTE’s rating may be reduced further if support from
 Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , which owns a 40 percent stake, weakens and
liquidity concerns persist, S&P said. OTE faces 3.3 billion
euros ($4.6 billion) of maturing debt from mid-2011 to 2013, the
agency said.  “The rating action reflects our view that the group’s
liquidity profile has weakened to less-than-adequate under our
criteria in the absence of any recent refinancing,” S&P said.
“The deteriorating macroeconomic conditions in OTE’s domestic
market, including a potential default of the Hellenic Republic,
could continue to negatively affect the group’s operating
results and access to capital markets.”  Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said the
government will meet commitments to international creditors to
deepen pension and wage cuts, promising parliamentary approval
for the draft 2012 budget and austerity measures. The economy is
expected to contract 5.5 percent in 2011 and 2.5 percent in 2012,
according to the draft budget.  Shares in OTE were up 0.9 percent at 3.53 euros at 3:47 p.m.
in  Athens , after four days of gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
