Ireland’s central bank is pressing
lenders to halt increasing variable  interest rates  on home
loans, as mortgage arrears rise, a person with knowledge of the
matter said.  Matthew Elderfield, the bank’s head of financial
regulation, will detail initiatives on mortgage arrears in a
speech in Cork, southern Ireland today.  The share of Irish private home loans more than 90 days in
arrears or restructured rose to 12 percent in the three months
through June, according to central bank data.  “While the Central Bank Governor does not have the power
to cap interest rates, he may seek a public policy response to
the issue,” said Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst  Eamonn Hughes  in
a note to clients today. “We expect to hear further details
when Elderfield addresses the Association of Compliance Officers
today.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
