Oil traded near the lowest close in
a week in  New York  as investors bet that demand will falter on
signs of slowing U.S. fuel consumption and a worsening debt
crisis in Europe.  Crude was at $84.26 a barrel up 3 cents, in electronic
trading on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:39 p.m. Sydney
time. The contract fell 1.6 percent yesterday to $84.23, the
lowest close since Oct. 7. Prices are up 1.5 percent this week
and 7.8 percent lower this year.  U.S. crude inventories climbed 1.34 million barrels last
week and total products supplied, a measure of fuel use, slid an
average 364,000 barrels a day to the lowest in four weeks,
according to the Energy Department. Standard & Poor’s Ratings
Services cut Spain’s long-term sovereign credit rating on risks
to growth prospects.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
