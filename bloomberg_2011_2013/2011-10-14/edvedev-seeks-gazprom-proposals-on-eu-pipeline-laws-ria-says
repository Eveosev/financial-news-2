Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
asked OAO Gazprom and the Energy Ministry to submit proposals
today on how to operate under European Union laws that don’t
allow gas suppliers to own pipelines, RIA Novosti reported.  Gas cooperation with European countries, which  Russia  sees
as very close energy partners, will face problems because of the
restriction, the state-run news agency reported from Medvedev’s
meeting with the  security council  outside Moscow.  EU lawmakers in April 2009 approved legislation forcing
members to choose one of three options to ease access to power
and gas grids. Members must either force companies to sell or
spin off their transmission businesses, require them to hand
grid management over to an independent operator or oblige them
to make the unit more independent through internal action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
