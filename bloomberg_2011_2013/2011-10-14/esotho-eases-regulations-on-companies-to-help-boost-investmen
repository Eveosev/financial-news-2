Lesotho eased regulations on setting
up companies to help boost investment in the southern African
nation, the ministry of trade and industry said.  The Companies Act will remove restrictions on which
industries businesses can operate in, the ministry said in an e-
mailed statement today. It sets out the procedures and fees to
start a company, it said.  The existing law and rules were “no longer responsive to
the needs of the modern business community,” the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
