Ukraine’s central bank forecast the
current-account deficit to widen to 4.5 percent of gross
domestic product from 2 percent in 2010,  Ekonomicheskie Izvestia 
newspaper reported, citing central bank Governor Serhiy Arbuzov.  Next year’s gap probably won’t change significantly from
this year, Arbuzov said, according to Izvestia.  The Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy is preparing legislation to
start a market of Treasury bills denominated in hryvnia and
linked to gold, according to the Kiev-based newspaper.  To contact the reporters on this story:
