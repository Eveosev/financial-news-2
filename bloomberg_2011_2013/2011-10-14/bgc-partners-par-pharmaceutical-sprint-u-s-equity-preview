Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in U.S. trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. in  New York .  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)   gained 5.5 percent, the
second most in the  S&P 500 , to $74.44. The holder of a 25
percent stake in the Macondo well that caused the biggest
offshore U.S. oil spill was boosted to “outperform” from
“market perform” by  Raymond James  & Associates. A $4 billion
payment to BP Plc to settle all claims over last year’s spill
removes a “significant overhang,” Raymond James said in a
note.  Brigham Exploration Co. (BEXP)   jumped 21 percent, the
most since July 2009, to $36.75. The Austin, Texas-based oil
exploration and production company agreed to be bought by
Statiuk ASA,  Norway ’s biggest oil and gas producer, for $36.50 a
share.  Cree Inc. (CREE)   declined 10 percent, the most since
March 23, to $26.61. The maker of energy-efficient lighting will
issue “disappointing guidance” when it reports first-quarter
earnings tomorrow,  Morgan Stanley (MS)  said in a note. Expectations
“are too high,” the note said.  El Paso Corp. (EP)   surged 25 percent to $24.45 for the
biggest advance in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Kinder
Morgan  Inc. (KMI US) agreed to buy El Paso for about $21.1
billion in cash and stock, creating the largest U.S. natural-gas
pipeline network in the energy industry’s biggest transaction in
more than a year. Kinder Morgan rose 4.8 percent to $28.19.  Oppenheimer & Co. cut El Paso Pipeline Partners (EPB US) to
“perform” from “outperform,” saying the parent company’s
assets will no longer be captive to the unit. El Paso Pipeline
tumbled 10 percent to $34.19.  Gannett Co. (GCI US) fell the second-most in the S&P 500,
sliding 8.7 percent to $9.99. The owner of 82 newspapers and 23
television stations reported third-quarter profit decreased 1.6
percent as circulation and print-advertising revenue declined.  Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)   dropped 10
percent, the most since Aug. 18, to $82.50. The seller of Keurig
single-pack coffee packets slipped after  David Einhorn , Chairman
of Greenlight Capital Inc., said the company should improve its
disclosure and has a “looming patent issue” on its single-
serve K-Cups.  Halliburton Co. (HAL)   erased 7.9 percent, the most since
Aug. 18, to $34.48. The world’s second-largest oilfield services
provider reported third-quarter per-share profit that beat the
average analyst estimate by 3 percent, the smallest margin in
three years, Bloomberg data show.  Interpublic Group of Cos. (IPG US) sank 7.1 percent to

28, to $10.07. The supplier of 3-D technology’s sales may be
hurt by an agreement between  Imax Corp. (IMAX)   and  Eastman
Kodak Co. (EK)  ,  Rich Greenfield , an analyst with BTIG LLC
said in a note. Kodak agreed to provide laser-projection
technology to Imax for an upfront payment of more than $10
million and ongoing royalties. Kodak gained 4.8 percent to
$1.30. Imax fell 4.3 percent to $16.64.  Sequenom Inc. (SQNM)   rose 4.5 percent to $5.56, the

quarter revenue of $19.6 billion, missing the $20.2 billion

since July 21, to $26.25. The maker of computer disk drives said

flooding. The interruption will have a “significant impact” on
