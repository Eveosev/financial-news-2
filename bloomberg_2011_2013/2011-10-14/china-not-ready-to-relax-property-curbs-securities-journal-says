Conditions are not yet ripe for
 China  to relax its tightening policies on the property market
and some of the measures may be maintained as home sales in the
first half of the year were still “sound,” Wang Yulin, deputy
head of the policy research center at the Ministry of Housing
and Urban-Rural Development said in an interview in today’s
China Securities Journal.  Property tightening is entering a “critical period” and
has shown initial effects, Wang was quoted as saying. The
sustainability of these results will depend on the continuity
and stability of the policies, he said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
