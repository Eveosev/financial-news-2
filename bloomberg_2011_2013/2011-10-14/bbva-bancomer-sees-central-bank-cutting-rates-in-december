BBVA Bancomer expects  Mexico ’s
central bank to start cutting rates by 25 basis points in
December, depending on the exchange rate’s performance, said
economist Julian Cubero.  BBVA Bancomer had previously forecast that Banxico, as the
central bank is known, would increase rates in May 2013. Cubero
spoke in a telephone interview in Mexico City.  Mexico’s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate
unchanged today at 4.50 percent for a 22nd straight meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
