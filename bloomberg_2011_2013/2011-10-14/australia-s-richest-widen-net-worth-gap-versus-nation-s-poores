The richest Australians saw their
wealth rise at more than triple the pace of the poorest as the
nation’s economy withstood the global recession of 2009, a
government report showed.  Average net worth jumped 15 percent to A$2.2 million ($2.2
million) for the wealthiest households in the four years through
June 30, 2010, compared with a 4 percent gain to A$31,829 for
those at the other end and an 11 percent increase to A$427,168
for those in the middle, the  Australian Bureau of Statistics 
said in a  report  released today.  The Australian economy has avoided a recession for two
decades as demand for the nation’s iron ore, coal and natural
gas from  Asia ’s developing economies bolsters exports, keeps
unemployment near 5 percent and lifts wages.  Sixty-two percent of households were in the highest net
worth category in 2010, up from 61 percent in 2006, and 1
percent are in the lowest, little changed from four years
earlier, according to the report.  The average net worth of all Australian households rose 14
percent to A$719,561, today’s report showed.  Australia  ranked sixth worldwide in gross domestic product
per capital in 2010, up from 15th place five years earlier,
according to International Monetary Fund figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
