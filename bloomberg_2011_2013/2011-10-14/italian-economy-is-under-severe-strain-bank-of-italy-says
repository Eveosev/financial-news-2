Italy ’s economy is under
“particularly severe strain” and growth slowed in the third
quarter, the nation’s central bank said.  “Despite the fundamental soundness of the banking system,
the low level of  household debt  and the absence of significant
property market imbalances, Italy was hit hard by the crisis as
a consequence of its large public debt, dependence on world
trade, and poor medium-term growth prospects,” the  Bank of
Italy  said today in its quarterly bulletin.  Gross domestic product slowed in the third quarter after
expanding 0.3 percent in the three months through June, the
central bank said, citing weak domestic demand and languishing
exports.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
