The Port Authority of  New York  and
 New Jersey  agreed to rebuild a Greek Orthodox church near
 Manhattan ’s World Trade Center site, more than 10 years after
the property was destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks.  A 4,100-square-foot (380-square-meter) church will be built
at the east end of Liberty Park, across Liberty Street from the
Sept. 11 memorial, the authority said in an e-mailed statement.
An agreement with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America was
signed today, after a four-month engineering study found the
church could be erected without interfering with the  trade
center reconstruction  schedule, according to the agency.  St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, housed in a four-story,
1,200-square-foot building on Cedar Street, was crushed in the
terrorist attacks when the entire weight of the south tower came
down on it, according to the church’s  website . Negotiations for
rebuilding broke down in 2009 and resulted in litigation this
year, said the  Port Authority , which owns the trade center site.  “We lost St. Nicholas Church in the destruction of Sept.
11 and for too long its future has been uncertain,” New York
Governor  Andrew Cuomo  said in the statement. “With this
agreement, we are continuing New York’s collective healing.”  The new building will include a non-denominational
bereavement center, according to the Port Authority. The agency
will assume all below-ground infrastructure costs, while the
archdiocese will be responsible for above-ground construction
expenses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
