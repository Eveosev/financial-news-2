General Electric Co. (GE)  plans to build
its first thin-film solar factory in  Colorado  after months of
negotiations with at least two states that wanted the $300
million plant and the 350 full-time jobs it will require.  The plant will make enough panels annually for customers to
generate power for 80,000 U.S. homes, or about 400 megawatts,
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE said today in an e-mailed
statement.  GE is entering a struggling solar industry with the
Bloomberg Global Leaders Solar Index of 37 manufacturers down 49
percent this year and module prices sinking in an oversupplied
market. Silicon panels, which convert more sunlight to power
than thin-film, will slip to $1.35 per watt this year and as low
as $1.05 per watt in 2013, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  Global production capacity next year will be more than
double the demand for panels of about 20,000 megawatts, said
Paul Leming, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities in  New York .  GE will need to improve efficiency to lower costs for
developers and compete with  China , which produces more than half
the world’s solar panels. GE decided to expand manufacturing
after reaching a 12.8 percent conversion rate, a record for
their technology.  The factory will be located in an existing building in
Aurora, Colorado, east of Denver, and is part of a $600 million
investment in GE’s solar business, the company said. About half
of that is for the new plant, Sean Gannon, a GE spokesman, said
today in an e-mail. Panel production will begin in 2012, and
initial shipments to customers will take place in 2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
