The trial of former Croatian Premier
Ivo Sanader, who is accused of taking bribes from  Austria ’s Hypo
Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG, will begin Oct. 28, judge Ivan
Turudic said today in Zagreb.  Sanader is accused of taking a bribe of 3.6 million kuna
($690,000) from the Austrian bank between 1994 to 1995, when he
was deputy foreign minister. In exchange, the Croatian
government at the time took a loan of 140 million Austrian
schillings ($14 million), the Alpine nation’s currency at the
time, from Hypo bank, the Prosecutor General said on Aug. 31.  Sanader was elected prime minister in 2003 and 2007 and
left his post without explanation in July 2009. He was also
indicted for corruption and abuse of power in a case involving
Croatian refiner INA Industrija Nafte d.d and  Hungary ’s Mol
Nyrt.  He was arrested in Austria in December and extradited to
 Croatia  in July.  To contact the reporter on the story:
