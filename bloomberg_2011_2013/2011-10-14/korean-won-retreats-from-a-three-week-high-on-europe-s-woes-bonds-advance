South Korea ’s won completed its
biggest weekly advance since April as  Asia ’s fourth-largest
economy and the U.S. agreed to cooperate on currency
stabilization.  President  Lee Myung Bak  and U.S. President Barack Obama
agreed to seek ways to stabilize the currency when needed, the
South Korean presidential office said in a statement today. The
currency snapped a five-week slide after exchange data showed
global funds bought $549 million more shares than they sold in
the three days ended Oct. 13. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of
shares fell after  Standard & Poor’s  cut Spain’s ratings by one
level to AA-, citing a likely deterioration of the nation’s bank
assets.  “The Spain downgrade dealt a blow to sentiment,” said Nam
Kyung Tae, a Seoul-based currency dealer at state-run Industrial
Bank of  Korea . The won was supported “by news of currency-
stabilization cooperation with the U.S,” he said.  The won strengthened 1.9 percent this week, the most since
the five-day period ended April 1, to 1,156.13 per dollar in
Seoul, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency was
little changed today.  The won will drop 1.8 percent against dollar during the
current quarter and climb 7.1 percent in the first three months
of next year, according to Standard Chartered Plc, the most-
accurate forecaster for the region.  The yield on the government’s 3.5 percent bonds due
September 2016 fell two basis points today and six basis points
this week to 3.51 percent, according to prices from Korea
Exchange Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
