 The Polish zloty is still
“somewhat undervalued,”  Andrzej Bratkowski , a member of the
Monetary Policy Council, said in an interview with TVN CNBC

strong” zloty appreciation, adding that he can’t rule that the
currency may weaken because of the European debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
