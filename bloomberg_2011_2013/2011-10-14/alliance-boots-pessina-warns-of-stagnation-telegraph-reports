Alliance Boots Executive Chairman
Stefano Pessina said economic stagnation and unemployment risked
tying U.K. companies to low growth for another three years, the
 Daily Telegraph  reported, citing a speech he made to private
equity investors in London.  Alliance Boots, the U.K.’s largest drugstore chain, was
acquired by KKR Inc. for 11 billion pounds ($17 billion) in 2007
and Pessina said had the company still been publicly traded “we
would have been limited by the volatility of our share price,”
the newspaper said.  Pessina said he was deeply pessimistic over the world
economy, which he said would worsen once the scale of
unemployment became clear in the next 12 months, the Telegraph
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
