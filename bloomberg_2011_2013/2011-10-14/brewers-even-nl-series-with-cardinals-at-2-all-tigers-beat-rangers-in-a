The  Milwaukee Brewers  rallied from
an early two-run deficit to defeat the  St. Louis  Cardinals 4-2
and even the National League Championship Series at two games
apiece.  Jerry Hairston Jr. had a run-scoring double and Ryan Braun
and Yuniesky Betancourt drove in runs with singles as the
Brewers scored four unanswered runs after solo homers by Matt
Holliday and Allen Craig gave host St. Louis a 2-0 lead in the
third inning.  Randy Wolf got the win, allowing two runs on six hits in
seven innings. Game 5 of the best-of-seven series is set for
tomorrow night at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.  In the American League, Justin Verlander struggled through
7 1/3 innings and the  Detroit Tigers  stayed alive with a 7-5 win
at home against Texas. The Rangers still lead three games to two
as the best-of-seven series switches back this weekend to
Arlington, Texas.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
