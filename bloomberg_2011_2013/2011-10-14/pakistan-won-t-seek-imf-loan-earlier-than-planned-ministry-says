Pakistan ’s finance secretary hasn’t
said the country would be seeking a new program with the
 International Monetary Fund  earlier than planned, the finance
ministry said, clarifying a report in the Dawn newspaper.  “The country is on course with regard to its strategy
regarding its relationship with the IMF,” the ministry said in
a statement yesterday evening after Dawn reported on Oct. 12 the
government may enter a new program later in the year. Dawn cited
a presentation the country’s finance secretary gave to a panel
of lawmakers on Oct. 11.  The Washington-based fund suspended disbursements to
Pakistan in May 2010 after the country failed to meet conditions
attached to a $11.3 billion loan. The country didn’t seek a new
program after the previous one expired on Sept. 30.  Pakistan is also likely to achieve its budget deficit
target of 4 percent this year, the  finance ministry  said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
