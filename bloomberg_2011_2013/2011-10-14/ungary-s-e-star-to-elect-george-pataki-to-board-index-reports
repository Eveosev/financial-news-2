Hungarian energy group E-Star
Alternativ Nyrt. will probably elect former New York Governor
George Pataki to its board next month, news portal  Index 
reported.  The company, formerly known as RFV Nyrt. has asked Pataki
and Csaba Lantos, a former deputy chief executive at OTP Bank
Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest lender, to join the board, Index said
late yesterday, citing E-Star Chairman Csaba Soos.  Pataki would have to travel to Hungary for board meetings
once a quarter and might receive about 800,000 forints ($3,780)
a month for his work, Index added, without citing anyone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
