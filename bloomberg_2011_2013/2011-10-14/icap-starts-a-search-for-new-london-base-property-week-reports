Icap Plc is searching for new
headquarters in central  London , which could lead the company to
leave the Broadgate complex owned by British Land Co. and
 Blackstone Group LP (BX) ,  Property Week  reported.  Icap said it has instructed adviser Drivers Jonas Deloitte
LLP to start a search for an office with as much as 275,000
square feet (25,548 square meters) configured into large trading
floors, the trade publication said, citing an Icap spokesman.  Icapâ€™s leases expire in 2016 and it may consider taking
space in new developments, Property Week said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
