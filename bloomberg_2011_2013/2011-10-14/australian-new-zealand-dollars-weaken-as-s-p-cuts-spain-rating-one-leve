The Australian and New Zealand
dollars extended their second straight weekly gains on increased
demand for higher-yielding assets as Group of 20 finance
ministers met to prevent  Europe ’s debt crisis from slowing
global growth.  The Aussie had its biggest five-day rally versus its U.S.
counterpart in almost three years. Both South Pacific currencies
fell earlier today against the yen after Standard & Poor’s cut
Spain’s credit rating.  “The market will want to sell the euro before it sells any
other currencies, so we’re buying Aussie and kiwi,” said Kurt Magnus, executive director of currency sales in Sydney at Nomura
Holdings Inc., Japan’s biggest brokerage.  Australia’s dollar rose 1.3 percent to $1.0325 at 2:41 p.m.
New York time and surged 5.7 percent this week, the most since
February 2009. The Aussie rose 1.7 percent to 79.72 yen after
earlier dropping as much as 0.4 percent.  New Zealand ’s currency
advanced 1.1 percent to 80.42 U.S. cents, appreciating 4.4
percent this week. It gained 1.5 percent to 62.09 yen after
earlier dropping 0.6 percent.  The MSCI World index of equities rose 1.2 percent. The  S&P
500 Index  advanced 1.1 percent.  European officials were discussing the evolving strategy to
contain debt turmoil at this weekend’s Group of 20 meeting in
Paris with global financial leaders including U.S. Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner .  Spain’s credit rating was cut for the third time in three
years by S&P, which lowered the ranking one level to AA- with a
negative outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
