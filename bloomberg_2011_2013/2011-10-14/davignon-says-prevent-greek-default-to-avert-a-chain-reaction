Etienne Davignon, the Belgian
billionaire and Suez board member, said that a Greek default has
to be prevented in order to avert a chain reaction.  Davignon, speaking today in Bucharest, said the euro region
needs tools to punish states that violate debt and deficit limit
rules. He said he doesnâ€™t believe in the idea of creating a
euro-region  finance ministry .  To contact the reporter on this story:
