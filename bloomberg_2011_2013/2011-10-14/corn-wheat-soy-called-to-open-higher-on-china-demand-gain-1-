What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 5 cents to 7 cents a bushel
higher on the  Chicago  Board of Trade after government reports
this week showed rising import demand from China, the worldâ€™s
biggest consumer after the U.S.,  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice
president for the Linn Group in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  -- Wheat futures may open 6 cents to 8 cents a bushel higher on
the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
export sales rose to a three-week high, including purchases by
China, Huckabay said.  -- Soybean futures may open 7 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago after the government reported that 83 percent of U.S.
exports last week went to  China , which boosted purchases after
prices tumbled in September, Huckabay said.  Soybean-oil  futures
are expected to open 0.45 cent to 0.6 cent higher a pound, and
soybean-meal futures may open up $2 to $4 for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
