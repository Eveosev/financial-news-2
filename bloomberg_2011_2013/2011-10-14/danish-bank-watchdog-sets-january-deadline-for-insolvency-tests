Denmark ’s bank watchdog aims to
complete its inspections of lenders at risk of insolvency by
January, and expects most will fail its audit.  The Financial Supervisory Authority’s review covers lenders
identified by the regulator as “risky” and “in seven out of
10 inspections, we insist on either higher writedowns or higher
solvency requirements,” Ulrik Noedgaard, director general at
the FSA, said in an interview.  The regulator has warned Denmark’s banks it is stepping up
risk management demands and will no longer tolerate what
Noedgaard has characterized as “optimistic” reported
writedowns. As many as 15 Danish banks may fail before the
country’s crisis is over,  Standard & Poor’s  warned in July. The
chairman of the state-backed bank resolution unit, Henning Kruse
Petersen, has said there are about 75 too many regional banks in
Denmark.  The three Danish banks that failed since February all lost
money on property loans, while one also buckled under bad loans
to farming. Two of the insolvencies triggered senior creditor
losses under Denmark’s bail-in laws, the toughest in the
European Union. Though the government passed a consolidation
bill in September to avoid more bail-ins, there’s no guarantee
senior creditors won’t suffer further losses, said Henrik
Bjerre-Nielsen, chief executive officer at the winding-up unit
known as the Financial Stability Co.  “Looking at the macroeconomic developments and the state
of the commercial real estate market, things don’t look rosy
right now,” Noedgaard said.  Worst Performing  Danish banks are Scandinavia’s worst performing as the
industry struggles to emerge from the fallout of a burst housing
bubble and a frozen funding market. A deepening debt crisis and
looming credit crunch in  Europe  threaten to exacerbate financial
stresses in Denmark.  Danske Bank A/S had its credit grades put on rating watch
negative by  Fitch Ratings  amid concern that Denmark’s biggest
lender will suffer more losses from “continued asset quality
erosion” in Denmark and Ireland, where Danske owns  National
Irish Bank .  Adding to pressure on Danish banks is the expiry of a
state-backed guarantee on their debt. Lenders need to refinance
about 158 billion kroner ($29 billion) by 2013 and will rely on
a 400 billion-krone central bank liquidity lifeline to stay
afloat. The government has said it will only extend individual
guarantees in the event of mergers under its consolidation bill.  The Financial Stability Co. said this week it is advising
banks at risk of insolvency to prepare plans for auctioning off
their healthy parts after finding a last-minute buyer for  Max
Bank (MAX)  A/S, a Naestved, Denmark-based lender that collapsed under
the weight of bad real estate loans over the weekend.  ‘More Defaults’  “You’ll probably see more defaults. How many I don’t want
to guess, maybe below 10,” Simon Christensen, a Copenhagen-
based senior financial analyst at  Nordea Markets , a unit of
Nordea Bank AB, said yesterday. “But the sector will do a lot
to make sure senior creditors aren’t hit by further haircuts.”  Senior bondholders took losses when Amagerbanken A/S failed
in February and again when Fjordbank Mors collapsed in June.
Central bank Governor Nils Bernstein has urged banks to reduce
lending or look for buyers. Max Bank was able to sidestep the
bail-in laws when it became Denmark’s first lender to test the
consolidation bill.  Privately held Sparekassen Sjaelland A/S agreed to pay an
undisclosed sum to take over all private and corporate clients
at Max Bank with engagements of less than 5 million kroner a
piece. The remaining commitments will be transferred to the
Financial Stability Co.  Economic Toll  “Nobody wanted to take over these large commercial
portfolios and spend the next three, four years of their lives
trying to sort them out,” Noedgaard said. “Being able to put
them aside is a strong element of why we succeeded this time.”  Small banks are also under pressure to cope with tougher
regulatory and reporting standards, adding to incentives to seek
takeovers.  “All the new requirements, for example, more complex
reporting, more legal skills, et cetera, can result in smaller
banks looking for equally healthy partners,” Niels Storm
Stenbaek, chief economist at the Danish Bankers Association,
said yesterday in an e-mail.  Denmark’s banking crisis is taking its toll on recovery
prospects as lenders cut of loans to businesses. A survey by the
Confederation of Danish Industry shows lending tightened in the
third quarter from the previous three months as banks
deleverage, Klaus Rasmussen, the group’s chief economist, said
earlier this month. A quarter of firms surveyed by the
confederation said they had limited, or no, financing options in
the second quarter.  “A lot of these banks have already taken significant
writedowns on their loan portfolios,” Noedgaard said. “But
what we see in Max Bank and Fjordbank is that, in the current
economic climate, the loan portfolio gets weakened quarter by
quarter, and that will imply more writedowns, more solvency
requirements.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
