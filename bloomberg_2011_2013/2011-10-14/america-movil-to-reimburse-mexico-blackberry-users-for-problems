The Mexican units of America Movil
SAB and  Telefonica SA (TEF)  will reimburse users of BlackBerry
telephones for service interruptions yesterday, the companies
said in separate statements.  America Movil blamed  Research in Motion Ltd (RIM) , the maker of
BlackBerry phones, for the service problems and said it will
contact BlackBerry users directly for reimbursement, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Telefonica, Spain’s largest phone company, will compensate
Mexican Blackberry’s users with extra services, according to an
e-mailed statement. Both companies said BlackBerry services have
been normalized.  BlackBerry subscribers across most parts of the world lost
data services after a network failure in the U.K. this week
halted messaging and Web browsing. RIM Co-Chief Executive
Officer Jim Balsillie said today service has been fully restored
globally. Co-CEO  Mike Lazaridis  apologized, saying the company
has “let many people down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
