International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) , which rose to a record today, may keep climbing to $200
or more, according to analysts who are boosting their price
targets for the stock.  Eight of the 19 analysts with price targets surveyed by
Bloomberg estimate IBM will rise to at least $200, 7.1 percent
above yesterday’s close, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Three analysts increased their price targets to $200
or more this week, ahead of IBM’s Oct. 17 earnings announcement,
and Macquarie Capital began coverage with a $210 target today.  “IBM’s high recurring revenue business model has
‘Goldilocks’ characteristics, allowing IBM to perform well in a
good or bad macro environment,” said Louis Miscioscia, an
analyst for  Collins Stewart , who raised his price target to $210
today and has a “buy” rating on the stock.  Under Chief Executive Officer  Sam Palmisano , 60, IBM sold
off its personal computer business and focused on software and
services, helping lift per-share profit for more than 30
straight quarters. Now the world’s largest computer-services
provider, IBM has gained more than 80 percent since Palmisano
took over, including 30 percent this year.  Investors have been drawn by “a very stable earnings
stream,” said David Grossman of Stifel Nicolaus & Co., who has
price target of $210 for IBM. “If revenues start to come under
pressure for economic reasons, there are several levers at their
disposal that they can exercise to support earnings
expectations.”  IBM, based in Armonk,  New York , rose 2 percent to $190.53
at the close in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
