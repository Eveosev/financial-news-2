Russian producer prices, an early
indicator of inflation, rose less than economists estimated in
September.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines grew 18 percent
from a year earlier after an 18.5 percent advance in August, the
Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said in an e-mailed
statement today. The median forecast of eight economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was 18.9 percent.  Factory-gate prices declined 0.7 percent in September from
the previous month after a 4.6 percent rise in August, the
service said. Economists predicted a decrease of 0.5 percent,
according to the median of eight estimates in a separate
Bloomberg survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
