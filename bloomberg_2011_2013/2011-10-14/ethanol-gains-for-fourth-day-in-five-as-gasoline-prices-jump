Ethanol gained for the fourth time
in five days as gasoline futures rose the most in a week.  The biofuel increased 2.3 percent and gasoline advanced 2.4
percent after the U.S. Energy Department reported yesterday that
stockpiles of the motor fuel fell by 4.13 million barrels in the
week ended Oct. 7. The 1.9 percent decline was the most since
April 8.  “There is a hangover from that” report,  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “That kind of set the mood for the week.”  Denatured ethanol for November delivery gained 6.1 cents to
settle at $2.701 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Gasoline for November delivery increased 6.72 cents to
settle at $2.8247 a gallon in  New York . The contract covers
reformulated gasoline, which is made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  In cash market trading, ethanol in New York rose 7 cents,
or 2.5 percent, to $2.895 a gallon, and on the West Coast the
biofuel gained 5.5 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $2.895, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf jumped 20 cents, or 7.6 percent,
to $2.825 a gallon, and in  Chicago  the additive gained 11 cents,
or 4.1 percent, to $2.775, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
