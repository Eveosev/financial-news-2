Envoys from a negotiating group
aimed at mediating the  peace process  between Israel and the
Palestinians will meet in  Jerusalem  next week, Palestinian
Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said.  If Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “agrees to a
two-state solution based on the 1967 border and he stops
building settlements, we are ready to resume negotiations right
away,” Abbas told reporters today after talks in Paris with
French President Nicolas Sarkozy.  Abbas arrived from Latin America, where he met with leaders
in Colombia and Venezuela to drum up support for a Security
Council vote to accord United Nations membership to a
Palestinian state. No vote has been scheduled, and he wouldn’t
say when he expected it could come.  Next week’s meeting of the so-called Mideast Quartet,
comprising the U.S., the European Union, Russia and the  United
Nations , will be at the delegate level, Abbas said. “We will
see them and perhaps they will also see Israeli
representatives,” he said.  Two days ago, the U.S. State Department said the Quartet
was seeking to arrange Israel-Palestinian talks on Oct. 23 in
Jordan.  The Palestinians have said that at least eight council
members -- Russia, China, Gabon, Nigeria,  South Africa , Brazil,
Lebanon and India -- will back their bid in the Security
Council. A U.S. veto pledge notwithstanding, that still leaves
the Palestinians one vote short of the nine needed for
membership.  Sarkozy told the UN last month that France prefers a return
to direct negotiations to a premature  Security Council  vote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
