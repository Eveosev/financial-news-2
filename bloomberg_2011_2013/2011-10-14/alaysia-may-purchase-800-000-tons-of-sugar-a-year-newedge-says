Malaysia  may be seeking to import
800,000 metric tons of raw sugar annually over the next three
years, according to Newedge Group, the biggest U.S. sugar-
futures broker.  Cash brokers say that Malaysia is bidding at below-market
prices for the supply,  Michael McDougall , a senior vice resident
at New York-based Newedge, said today in a telephone interview.
The bids couldn’t be immediately confirmed.  “Two years ago, when they negotiated this contract, it was
600,000 tons, and it did cause a brief blip in the market,”
McDougall said in an e-mailed report. “The bids they have put
out are far away from realistic selling prices, but they have at
least put a temporary floor to the market.”  Raw sugar for March delivery climbed 3.8 percent to close
at 27.93 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in  New
York , after touching 28.05, the highest for a most-actively
traded contract since Sept. 16. The commodity rallied 11 percent
this week, the biggest gain in two months.  Newedge Group is co-owned by French banks Societe Generale
and  Credit Agricole .  To contact the reporter on this story:
