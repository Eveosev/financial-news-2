Oil slid for a third day in  New
York , paring a weekly gain, on signs of slowing fuel consumption
in the U.S. and a worsening debt crisis in Europe.  Crude for November delivery dropped as much as 28 cents, or
0.3 percent, to $83.95 a barrel in electronic trading on the New
York Mercantile Exchange and was at $84.01 at 11:39 a.m. Sydney
time. The contract fell 1.6 percent yesterday to $84.23, the
lowest close since Oct. 7. Prices are up 1 percent this week and
8.1 percent lower this year.  U.S. crude inventories climbed 1.34 million barrels last
week and total products supplied, a measure of fuel use, slid an
average 364,000 barrels a day to the lowest in four weeks,
according to the Energy Department.  Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services cut  Spain ’s long-term
sovereign credit rating to AA- from AA, citing risks to growth
prospects.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
