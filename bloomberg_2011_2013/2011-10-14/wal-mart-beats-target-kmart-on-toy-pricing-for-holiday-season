Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) ’s prices on
toys it expects to be best-sellers this holiday season are lower
than competitors  Target Corp. (TGT)  and  Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD) ’s Kmart
chain, according to a Bloomberg Industries analysis.  Prices for a group of 15 toys that included Elmo Rocks from
 Hasbro Inc. (HAS)  and  Leapfrog Enterprises Inc. (LF) ’s Leap Pad Explorer
are 9 percent higher at Target and 13 percent more expensive at
Kmart, according to a report led by Poonam Goyal, a Bloomberg
Industries analyst.  Wal-Mart, the world’s largest retailer, also had lower
prices than  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  on 18 items and Toys “R” Us Inc.
on 12 comparable toys, the study showed.  U.S. retail sales growth will slow to 2.8 percent during
the holiday season this year amid decelerating job growth, a
weak housing market and a volatile stock market, the  National
Retail Federation  said last week. The increase to an estimated
$465.6 billion in sales in November and December compares with a
5.2 percent jump last year, the Washington-based NRF said.  Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, rose 0.8 percent
to $55.46 at 4:15 p.m. in New York. Minneapolis-based Target
advanced 0.4 percent to $52.95, and Hoffman Estates, Illinois-
based Sears gained 2.9 percent to $71.54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
