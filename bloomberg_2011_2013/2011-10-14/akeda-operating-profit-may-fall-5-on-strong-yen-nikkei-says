Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. may report
a 5 percent drop in first-half operating profit due to the yenâ€™s
appreciation and lower-than-expected sales of its diabetes
treatment Actos, the Nikkei newspaper said.  Profit probably fell to about 210 billion yen ($2.7
billion) in the six months ended Sept. 30, the newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information. The
company had estimated operating profit of 220 billion yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
