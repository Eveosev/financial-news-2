Gilts fell, extending the biggest
weekly decline in three months, as gains in European stocks
curbed demand for the relative safety of government debt.  Benchmark 10-year yields approached the highest level since
August amid speculation the Group of 20 nations will take
additional steps to counter  Europe ’s debt crisis including
giving the International Monetary Fund more resources. The pound
extended weekly gains versus the dollar and the yen.  “Some of the despair in equity markets has eased up a bit
so investors are taking some of their chips off the fixed income
table and looking at riskier asset classes,” said Anthony O’Brien, a fixed-income strategist at Morgan Stanley in London.
“People are also feeling a little less gloomy about the
political situation in Europe towards the debt crisis, even
though the economic picture doesn’t look too good.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 2.61 percent at 4:47 p.m.  London  time,
after climbing to 2.67 percent on Oct. 13, the highest since
Aug. 9. The 3.75 percent security due September 2021 fell 0.48,
or 4.8 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,578) face amount, to 109.875.
The rate climbed 14 basis points this week, the most since the
period ended July 1.  Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-20, who
started a two-day meeting today in Paris, are said to be putting
together a rescue plan for the region. European leaders may
complete the plan at an Oct. 23 summit to present to a gathering
of G-20 chiefs on Nov. 3-4.  Shares Gain  European shares rallied on optimism the plan will help
contain the sovereign debt crisis. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index
rose 0.8 percent and the FTSE 100 Index gained 1.2 percent.  The pound appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.5807, after
climbing to a four-week high of $1.5853, the strongest since
Sept. 15. Sterling strengthened 0.8 percent to 122.27 yen. It
fell 0.4 percent to 87.69 pence per euro.  Gilts declined even after Standard & Poor’s cut  Spain ’s
credit rating by one level yesterday to AA-, the fourth-highest
investment grade. It was the third downgrade in three years.  U.K. debt extended losses after a U.S. report showed retail
sales rose more in September than economists forecast. Sales
increased 1.1 percent, the most since February, the Commerce
Department said in  Washington .  Annual Return  U.K. government debt has returned 11 percent this year,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  The securities have been boosted as the euro-area crisis
drove investors to safer investments, Prime Minister  David Cameron  pursued austerity measures amid a growth slowdown and
the Bank of  England  resumed government debt purchases to cap
borrowing costs.  The central bank increased the size of its bond purchases
last week, expanding the program to 275 billion pounds from 200
billion pounds, the biggest increase since the first round of
so-called quantitative easing, which began in March 2009.  Policy makers “could well decide” to expand the program
again, the  Guardian newspaper  quoted  Bank of England  deputy
governor  Charles Bean  as saying in an article yesterday.  The pound has lost 1.4 percent in the last six months and
3.1 percent in the past year against a basket of its nine most-
traded peers as measured by Bloomberg Correlation Weighted
Currency Indexes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
