Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi 
should consider reintroducing the ICI tax on main properties to
rebalance the weighting of other levies on Italian taxpayers,
the central bank said.  “The exemption of main properties from the ICI tax
represents an anomaly in comparison with other countries,”
Daniele Franco, head of economic research at the Bank of  Italy ,
said at  an hearing  yesterday at the Senate’s Finance Committee
in Rome.  The taxation on citizens’ first homes, which helped fund
local administrations, was abolished by Berlusconi’s government
in 2008. The ICI tax still applies to other properties.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lorenzo Totaro in Rome at
