Marks & Spencer Plc can claim tax
relief on some losses from its German and Belgian units, appeals
court judges said in the company’s decade-long legal battle with
British tax authorities.  The London court refused permission to appeal a June 2010
ruling allowing Marks & Spencer to reduce its tax bill based on
losses incurred in 2000, 2001 and 2002, while refusing claims
from 1998 and 1999. Under U.K. law, companies can use losses in
a subsidiary to offset taxable profits in later years.  Marks & Spencer, the largest British clothing retailer, has
been fighting U.K. authorities for nearly 10 years over whether
it can claim tax relief on losses from its now-defunct
subsidiaries in Germany and  Belgium .  Simon Whitehead, a lawyer at Dorsey & Whitney who
represents Marks & Spencer, said today’s ruling was
“encouraging.”  London-based Marks & Spencer decided to close its stores in
continental  Europe  in March 2001. Its German subsidiary had
never made a profit since opening in 1996, peaking with a loss
of 30.7 million pounds in the year ending March 2000, according
to court documents.  HMRC, the British tax authority, said in an e-mailed
statement that it would appeal to the  Supreme Court .  To contact the reporter on this story:
