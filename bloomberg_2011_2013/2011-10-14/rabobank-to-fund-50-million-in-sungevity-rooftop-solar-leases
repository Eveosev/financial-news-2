The U.S. unit of Rabobank Groep, the
world’s biggest agricultural lender, created a fund to finance
$50 million in residential rooftop solar-power systems
installations by Sungevity Inc.  Sungevity is pursuing more than $175 million in projects,
the Oakland, California-based company said in a statement. The
fund announced today will finance solar systems on over 1,000
homes.  “Next year will be a big year for us after a banner year
this year,” said Sungevity founder Danny Kennedy in an
interview today. “We’ll continue to raise more funds through
2012.”  Residential solar energy is a “promising market
opportunity and we are pleased to support its adoption in
California and elsewhere in the U.S. through our new fund with
Sungevity,” said Gianluca Signorelli, vice president at
Rabobank N.A., in the statement.  Sungevity currently operates in Arizona, California,
 Colorado , Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland,  New Jersey , and  New
York  and has leased more than 3,000 systems.  “It’s an incredible time to be in solar as it grows and
becomes more affordable,” said Kennedy, whose company has
tripled its staff over the last year to more than 300.  In August,  Citigroup Inc. (C)  created a tax-equity fund to
support $50 million in Sungevity installations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
