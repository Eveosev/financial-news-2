Group of 20 finance ministers
discussed proposals to increase global lending to  Europe  to help
stem its sovereign debt crisis, Chinese deputy finance minister
 Zhu Guangyao  said.  “The meetings have been discussing how to increase
resources for coping with the crisis and to stabilize markets,”
Zhu told reporters in today in Paris, where G20 finance
ministers and central bankers have convened. Asked whether the
G20 is considering an increase in lending resources for Europe
under the framework of the  International Monetary Fund , Zhu
said: “Of course this is what Europe desires a lot for coping
with the ciris, but it has just been discussed.”  He said China has made clear that it “supports stability
in Europe and holds an open attitude toward all discussions.”  Asked if the yuan was part of the agenda, he said
“currently the priority is to handle Europe’s issues.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
