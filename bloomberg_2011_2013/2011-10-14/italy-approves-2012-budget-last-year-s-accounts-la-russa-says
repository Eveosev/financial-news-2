Prime Minister  Silvio Berlusconi ’s
Cabinet approved a draft of the 2012 budget, Defense Secretary
Ignazio La Russa said.  The Cabinet also approved the balance sheet for the
execution of last year’s budget, La Russa said at a press
conference in  Rome  today after the meeting.  Berlusconi failed to muster a majority in parliament this
week on the 2010 accounts, leading him to call a confidence vote
today to prove he still had enough support to govern. Parliament
will now have to hold another vote on last year’s budget
results.  To contact the reporter on this story:
