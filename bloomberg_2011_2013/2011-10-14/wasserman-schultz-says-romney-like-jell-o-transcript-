Democratic National Committee
Chairwoman  Debbie Wasserman Schultz  said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,” airing
this weekend, that Republican presidential candidate  Mitt Romney 
is like “Jell-O” and fails to take firm positions on important
issues.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the show with the Democratic National
Committee Chair, a member of Congress, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for being with us.  REPRESENTATIVE DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you for
having me.  HUNT: You were in Hanover,  New Hampshire , for the great
Republican debate. You heard Mitt Romney say Barack Obama came
to the presidency inexperienced. He had no private secular
background. The country is mired in economic failure and
divided. It’s time for a change.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, I’m proud of the work that  Barack
Obama  has been able to do and the progress that we’ve made,
although we have a long way to go when it comes to getting the
economy turned around.  HUNT: And how about Romney’s particular charges against
him? What did you think of Romney in that debate?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, Mitt Romney is pretty difficult to
pin down. It’s sort of like trying to nail down Jell-O. I like
my candidates to have a little bit more courage of their
conviction and stick to one position and not be all over the
place whichever the wind blows. And I think that’s been a big
problem for Mitt Romney.  HUNT: But don’t you think that Mitt Romney would be the
toughest opponent for Barack Obama in the fall of 2012?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I think it doesn’t much matter which one
of these nine Republicans is the nominee because they’re all
interchangeable. They are all embracing the  Tea Party . They are
all completely right wing when it comes to the economy. They
have no interest in focusing on the middle class and putting
them back to work.  That was what was shocking to me, Al, was none of them in
that very intimate opportunity that they had at the Bloomberg
debate presented any proposals to help the middle class or
create jobs that would put people back to work.  HUNT: And partners are requiring me to say that Bloomberg
and Washington Post debate, but -  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Okay.  HUNT: - let me read a couple numbers to you. The
president’s job approval is 45 percent. No president has ever
been re-elected with numbers that low, consumer confidence index
at 55.7 percent. No president has ever been re-elected when it
was lower than 75 percent. It’s an uphill slog for Barack Obama.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, we’re 13 months out.  HUNT: That’s right.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And we’re not really focused on polls
right now. We are singularly focused on getting the economy
moving again. We are trying to make sure that we can pass the
American Jobs Act. The president is pushing that hard. It’s
shocking that the Republicans in the United States Senate refuse
to even allow a debate on that and shot that down in the vote
this week. What are they opposed to? Are they opposed to putting
$1,500 back in the pocket through a payroll tax cut to the
average middle class family? Are they opposed to keeping
teachers, police officers and firefighters on the job, or fixing
bridges and roads?  HUNT: One bit of good news for you and the DNC is you’re
flush with more money than at any time since the Clinton years.
Now I know you’re worried about all these outside groups. I’ve
heard that a lot, but what are you going to do with all that
money? You have any new programs, new initiatives?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: We are going continue to run the type of
grassroots campaign that Barack Obama ran in 2008. We will have
the most robust, aggressive grassroots presidential campaign in
American history. We are already up and running. We are putting
the infrastructure in place, the neighborhood teams. We’ve got
our volunteers engaged all over the country, enthusiastic really
active volunteers. We have 13 months to go, but we are going to
win this campaign because we’re not going to be outworked.  HUNT: Let me ask you one question about the White House.
Recently Anita Dunn, a former top Obama aide, said that sexism
is pervasive in this White House that she said if it was a
private company we’d be in court for a hostile workplace. This
is an issue you care a lot about, I know. Does that bother you
that someone that high feels there’s such pervasive sexism?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, I know Anita Dunn well. And I know
that she disputes the accuracy of the way she was quoted
(inaudible).  HUNT: Well, the context, but she still said there was a lot
of sexism there.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: There - the example that Barack Obama
has set for how we should address the issues important to women
has been remarkable. The first bill he signed into law was a
Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. He established the White House
Council on Women and Girls to make sure that administration
policies throughout all the agencies focus on the needs of
women. He appointed not one, but two women to the  Supreme Court 
with his only two Supreme Court appointments, including the
first Latino. Barack Obama understands that we need to make sure
that we level the playing field for women and help women make
sure that they can get ahead and be prosperous.  HUNT: Would you like to see a few more women in the top
echelons of the White House and the campaign?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: There are women in leadership positions
throughout the campaign and throughout the administration.  HUNT: So it’s okay.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I think the president is doing great and
has a wonderful record.  HUNT: Okay. Let’s turn to a couple issues. You mentioned
the jobs bill. It’s been snared and parsed about. You hope it
all gets through. Do you think that parts of it may be broken
off? And if so what’s the more likely candidate to get through?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, I think it would be irresponsible
if the Republicans and the House don’t take up that bill.  HUNT: Right.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: It would irresponsible for the Senate to
vote it down or not even allow a debate on it. We need to have
Republicans come to the table and work with Democrats on making
sure that we can get -  HUNT: Payroll tax is the most likely to get through, how
they -?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I certainly hope so.  HUNT: Yes.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Why would the Republicans not embrace
that? The sad thing is you haven’t had them embrace it. These
are guys in the House and the Senate, Republican members of
Congress who’ve signed more no-new-taxes pledges than anyone in
history.  HUNT: And this would be a tax increase.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And this would be a tax increase. Why
would they raise taxes on the middle class?  HUNT: Let me -  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: It’s unbelievable.  HUNT: Let me turn to  China . You’ve been a critic of China
manipulating its currency. You’re more with Mitt Romney on this
issue than Barack Obama who really doesn’t want this
legislation.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No. That’s not accurate.  HUNT: Okay.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: What President Obama’s position on this
legislation is, is that we need to address China’s manipulation
of their currency. There’s no question of that.  HUNT: But not legislatively.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No. We just need to make sure that in
terms of the world institutions that we are a member of that we
don’t run afoul of the policies there.  HUNT: You don’t think he’d sign that Senate bill though, do
you?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, I’m not - I - it’s hard to say. I
think right now what we’re doing is making sure - that the
administration is making sure that passing that legislation
wouldn’t be for naught and that it wouldn’t be basically
neutralized by our (inaudible).  HUNT: But passing it but not necessarily signing it.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No, no, no. What I’m saying is that -  HUNT: Yes.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: - the administration just wants to make
sure that the way we address China’s manipulation of their
currency does not run afoul of our international agreements -  HUNT: Okay.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: - because otherwise it’s not going to
solve the problem.  HUNT: You did pass the Star Trade bills in the House
recently, but that divides your party. I think Democrats were
almost totally split on that. You voted for them -  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I did.  HUNT: - I believe. Is that something that’s going to cause
problems for the party next year because of the opposition to
some of these trade pacts?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I don’t think so. It wasn’t - I’ve seen
our trade debates before. We’ve had much more vigorous and
divisive trade debates. This one I think a lot of progress has
been made especially with  Colombia  and with  South Korea . These
are much better trade agreements after they were renegotiated by
President Obama. They address environmental concerns, address
labor concerns. There was still - there’s some angst among
Democrats, but I think because it will help give a shot in the
arm to the economy and create jobs for Americans it’s a good
thing overall.  HUNT: You’ve got a president who’s facing a tough economy.
Redistricting slightly helped the Republicans, maybe not as much
as they had hoped for. They have a 242 to 195 margin, I think in
the House now. Tell me what the House will look like in January
of 2013. Can you win control? And do you think you will and by
how much?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I think Democrats will retake control of
the  House of Representatives .  HUNT: You do?  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: I do. We have to win 25 seats. There are
61 seats currently held by Republicans that were won by  John
Kerry  or Barack Obama. Forty-seven of those were won by both.
And we have to win 25. Because you have the Tea Party that has
such a stranglehold on the House Republican caucus they refuse
to allow anything through that would help the middle class,
haven’t done anything to create jobs in almost 11 months that
they’ve been in charge. I think that they’ve gotten a test run,
these Tea Party members of Congress, and they’re going to be
rejected.  HUNT: Madam Chairwoman, thank you so much for being with us
today.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Thank you so much.  HUNT: I appreciate it.  WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Nice to be with you.  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
