Bank Indonesia Governor Darmin
Nasution said that inflation isn’t his country’s primary
challenge at a time when the global economy is slowing.  “Inflation is no longer the No. 1 challenge,” Nasution
told reporters in Paris today. “When the economy slows down,
prices should go down.”  Interest rates  are at a “proper”
level after a recent cut, he added.  He also said that the Group of 20 still requires “a long
discussion” on reform of the global monetary system.  To contact the reporter on this story:
