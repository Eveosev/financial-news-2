Europe must “break the link”
between perceptions of sovereign-debt risk and confidence in the
banking system, Spanish Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said.  “We have to break the link between sovereign debt and the
difficulties of the financial system,” said Salgado at a news
conference in Madrid today after the government’s weekly cabinet
meeting. She said nothing had been decided about new stress
tests for banks or potential capital ratios that might be used
to conduct them.  European Commission President Jose Barroso today reiterated
his call for “coordinated action” across Europe to
recapitalize banks. European banking shares have plunged this
year, paced by  Dexia SA (DEXB) , the Franco-Belgian lender that’s being
broken up after concern over its holdings of Greek sovereign
debt blocked its access to short-term funding.  Salgado said there was general agreement that it would be
better for bigger banks to have more capital to show they can
absorb losses, and care should be given to fixing the criteria
for any new stress tests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
