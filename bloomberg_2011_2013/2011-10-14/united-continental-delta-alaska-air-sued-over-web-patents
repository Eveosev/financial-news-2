United Airlines , Continental
Airlines, Delta Air Lines and  Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK)  were sued by
a patent holder over wireless transaction technology for mobile
check-in and boarding passes.  Aeritas LLC , a Dallas-based wireless software maker,
contends the air carriers are using its inventions protected by
patents awarded in 2007 and 2011, according to four complaints
filed yesterday in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.  “Aeritas has suffered monetary damages in an amount
adequate to compensate for defendants’ infringement, but in no
event less than a reasonable royalty,” wrote the patent holder,
which is also seeking a jury trial and a halt to the airlines’
use of the inventions.  Continental and United are units of  United Continental
Holdings Inc. (UAL) , based in Chicago. Delta is based in Atlanta, and
Alaska Air is based in Seattle.  “We haven’t been served and are still assessing the claims
of the lawsuit,” Bobbie Egan, an Alaska Airlines spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed statement.  Trebor Banstetter, a Delta spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit. Representatives of
United Continental weren’t immediately available for comment.  The cases are Aeritas v. United Airlines Inc., 1:11-cv-
00970; Aeritas v. Continental Airlines Inc.; Aeritas v.  Delta
Air Lines Inc. (DAL) ; and Aeritas v. Alaska Air Group Inc., U.S.
District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To see the patents, click 7,933,589 and 7,209,903.  To contact the reporter on this story:
