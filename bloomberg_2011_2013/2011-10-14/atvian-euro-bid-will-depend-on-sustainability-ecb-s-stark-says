Latvia ’s bid to adopt the euro in
2014 will depend on the “sustainability” of the country’s
convergence with the monetary union, said European Central Bank
Executive Board Member Juergen Stark.  Convergence “is not just a snapshot of what happened in
2012 and 2013, and on this basis to make an assessment whether
Latvia can join the euro area in 2014,” Stark said in an
interview with Latvijas Radio today. “It is about the 
sustainability, the durability of convergence.”  “Convergence criteria” have previously been “interpreted
in a very laxist way,” he said in the radio interview. The
Baltic country should not “discontinue with the reform process,
Latvia has already achieved a lot. I can tell you that we at the
ECB are full of admiration for what has been done here in this
country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
