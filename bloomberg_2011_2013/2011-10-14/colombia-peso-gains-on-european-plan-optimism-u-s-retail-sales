Colombia ’s peso rose, posting its
biggest weekly increase since February 2010, on optimism
European leaders will reach an agreement to contain the region’s
debt crisis and as a higher-than-forecast increase in U.S.
retail sales eased concern the world’s biggest economy may
relapse into recession.  The peso gained 0.8 percent to 1,886.10 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 1,901.03 yesterday. The currency jumped 2.6 percent this
week, its biggest advance since the period ended Feb. 12, 2010.  “Speculation on the European rescue plan for now should
continue to drive appetite for risk,” said Felipe Campos, head
analyst at Alianza Valores SA brokerage in Bogota. Still,
“investors are being cautious and while they are buying
emerging market assets, demand isn’t strong.”  Elements of the European rescue plan emerged as finance
ministers and central bankers from the Group of 20 began talks
in Paris. The aim is to craft what the French and German
governments call a “durable” fix to the turmoil that has
propelled  Greece  to the edge of default and is rattling global
markets.  Sales in the U.S. rose 1.1 percent in September, more than
the 0.7 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg survey, easing
concern slumping confidence and scant hiring will derail the
biggest part of the economy. The U.S. is Colombia’s biggest
trading partner, buying about 40 percent of the South American
nation’s exports.  In a bid to ease the peso’s “extreme volatility,”
Colombia’s central bank said Sept. 30 it will auction $200
million in the  spot market  when the  exchange rate  moves more
than 2 percent above or below its 10-day moving average starting
today.  The yield on Colombia’s benchmark 10 percent bonds due in
July 2024 rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
7.48 percent. It fell 10 basis points this week. The bond’s
price fell 0.232 centavo to 120.221 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
