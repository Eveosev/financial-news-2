USEC Inc. (USU) , the supplier of enriched
uranium fuel for  power plants  that’s seeking a U.S. loan
guarantee, climbed a record 53 percent.  The company, based in Bethesda, Maryland, closed at $2.04
in  New York , the biggest gain since it started trading 13 years
ago, according to Bloomberg data.  USEC said on Sept. 30 it was cutting spending and would
begin layoffs if it doesn’t get the $2 billion loan guarantee
it’s seeking from the U.S. Energy Department by the end of
October to build a uranium-enrichment plant in Ohio.  “We have been meeting with DOE officials on a regular
basis but there is no news and the process just continues,”
Steve Wingfield, a company spokesman, said in a telephone
interview today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
