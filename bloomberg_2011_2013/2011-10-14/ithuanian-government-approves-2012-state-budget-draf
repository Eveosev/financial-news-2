The Lithuanian government approved a
2012 budget draft with a deficit below the limit required by the
European Union.  The government aims to cut the shortfall to 2.8 percent of
gross domestic product, less than the required threshold of 3
percent, from an estimated shortfall of 5.3 percent this year,
Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius said today at a press conference
in Vilnius. The bill will now go to parliament for approval.  The Baltic nation will implement measures including cuts
for ministries and investment projects and will demand state-
owned companies to divert a portion of their profits to the
budget to plug the shortfall by saving 1 billion litai ($398
million). The deficit cuts are intended to bring  Lithuania 
closer to euro adoption in 2014.  “We hope the parliament will behave responsibly and
approve the budget plan that will help cope with challenges on
the international markets,” Kubilius said.  The government expects to receive 540 million litai in
dividends from state-owned enterprises next year from 2011
revenue. This compares with 86 million litai in dividends it
received in this year’s budget.  Lithuania must also cut the deficit to meet a 2012 deadline
set by the European Commission as the shortfall has breached the
3 percent limit since 2008. Failure may prompt the EU’s
executive arm to impose penalties. The deficit was 7.1 percent
of GDP in 2010.  The government plans to raise 5.7 billion litai on
international markets next year, while the country’s total
borrowing needs are estimated at 9.4 billion litai, the budget
draft said. Government debt is projected at 37.3 percent of GDP
next year, according to the draft.  The approval of the plan for a 2.8 percent shortfall next
year in parliament may result in a credit-rating upgrade,
Finance Minister  Ingrida Simonyte  said in a Bloomberg interview
on Oct. 11.  “There’d be grounds for rating companies to review their
present assessment and consider a more positive rating,” she
said.  The Kubilius-led government implemented austerity measures
equal to 12 percent of GDP through 2009 and 2010 to grapple with
a ballooning deficit and a 14.8 percent drop in economic output.  To contact the reporter on this story:
