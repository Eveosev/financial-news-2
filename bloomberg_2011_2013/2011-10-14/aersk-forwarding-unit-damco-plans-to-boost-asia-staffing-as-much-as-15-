Damco, the freight-forwarding arm of
AP Moeller-Maersk A/S, the world’s largest container-shipping
line, plans to boost staffing in the Asia-Pacific region by 10
to 15 percent to expand in India and  China .  The hirings will take place over “a couple of years,”
Chief Executive Officer Rolf Habben-Jansen said in an interview
on Oct. 11.  Damco  plans to increase its business as it expects growth
in  Asia  and aims to take a larger market share by providing
better services, Habben-Jansen said. The unit expects 12 to 14
percent growth this year in the ocean freight-forwarding
segment, which represents about 40 percent of its sales,
compared with estimates for 6 to 8 percent growth in the world’s
container cargo, Habben-Jansen said.  Copenhagen-based Damco employed about 4,800 workers in the
Asia-Pacific region as of July, according to the company. It had
net turnover of more than $2.7 billion last year, it said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
