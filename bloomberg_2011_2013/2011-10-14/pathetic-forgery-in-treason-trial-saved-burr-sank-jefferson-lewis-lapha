Aaron Burr served as third vice
president of the U.S. under  Thomas Jefferson , who dropped him
from the ticket after the first term ended in 1805. Two years
later, at Jefferson’s insistence, Burr was tried for treason.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Though Burr maintained he was getting ready for war with
 Spain , he was accused of hiring armed men to invade  Mexico  and
lead the West into secession.  The main prosecution witness was General James Wilkinson,
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Army at New Orleans. Wearing a
uniform trimmed in gold braid, complete with sword, he strode
into the courtroom in Richmond, Virginia, “swelling like a
turkey cock,” in the words of Washington Irving.  Wilkinson had often been in touch with Burr about the armed
expedition before denouncing him to the president, and he now
produced a letter from Burr. It was, however, written in
Wilkinson’s own handwriting. The general said that he’d lost the
original, and admitted that in his “copy” he’d erased some
parts and changed others.  Burr was acquitted of all charges.  I spoke with  David Stewart , author of “American Emperor:
Aaron Burr’s Challenge to Jefferson’s America,” on the
following topics:  1. Secession Plan  2. Treason Trial  3. Effects of Acquittal  4. Trapped in Europe  5. Practice of Law  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
