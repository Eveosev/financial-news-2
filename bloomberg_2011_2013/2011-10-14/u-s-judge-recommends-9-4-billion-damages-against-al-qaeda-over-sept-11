A U.S. judge will decide whether to
award  Chubb Corp. (CB)  and four other insurers $9.4 billion in
damages in their suit against al-Qaeda over the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.  U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas in  Manhattan  said
yesterday that the insurers, which sued for money they paid to
policyholders to cover business and property losses, should
recover triple damages under the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act.  The insurers won a default judgment in 2006 against al-
Qaeda, the radical Muslim terrorist organization behind the
attacks, after the group didnâ€™t contest the suit.  Maas gave the parties 10 days to file any objections to his
report and recommendations to U.S. District Judge George Daniels. Daniels, who is presiding over the case, will then
decide whether to award the money.  The case is Federal Insurance Co. v. Al Qaida, 03-CV-6978,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
