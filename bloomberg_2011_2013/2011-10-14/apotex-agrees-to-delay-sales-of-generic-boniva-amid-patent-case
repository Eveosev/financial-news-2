Apotex Inc. agreed to delay selling
a generic version of the osteoporosis drug Boniva until a judge
rules on the validity of a  Roche Holding AG (ROG)  patent on the
medicine that expires in March 2012.  Apotex, based in Toronto, is seeking U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approval to sell a copy of Boniva. In 2007, Roche
sued in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, claiming its patent
is valid and enforceable, and that Apotex infringed it.  Under an accord filed in court Oct. 11, Apotex agreed it
wouldn’t sell its copy until U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler
rules on the validity and enforcement questions or the patent
expires, whichever comes first. Roche agreed to post a
$1 million bond.  The case is Hoffman-LaRoche Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2:07-cv-
04417, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey ( Newark ).  To contact the reporters on this story:
