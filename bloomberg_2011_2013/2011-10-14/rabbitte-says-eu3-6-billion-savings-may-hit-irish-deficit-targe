Irish Energy Minister Pat Rabbitte
said that he doesn’t want the government to seek more than 3.6
billion euros of savings next year to reduce its budget deficit.  “I don’t want to see us go beyond the 3.6 billion that
we’ve committed to,” Rabbitte said in an interview with Dublin-
based broadcaster RTE today. Rabbitte said the advice he has
received indicates that the figure will allow the country to
reach its 8.6 percent deficit target for next year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
