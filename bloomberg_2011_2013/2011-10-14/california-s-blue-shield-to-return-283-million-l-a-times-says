Blue Shield of  California  will
return a further $283 million to policyholders, keeping a pledge
to give back cash when profit exceeds 2 percent of revenue, the
Los Angeles Times reported.  The non-profit insurer has already returned $167 million
this year, the newspaper said.  Chief Executive Officer Bruce Bodaken said people are
cutting back spending and postponing non-essential treatment,
hence Blue Shield has paid out less in claims, the Times said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
