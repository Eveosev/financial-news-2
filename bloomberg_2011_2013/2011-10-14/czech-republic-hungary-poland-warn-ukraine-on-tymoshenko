The  Czech Republic , Hungary and
 Poland  find it impossible to “smoothly” continue talks with
Ukraine about closer European Union ties while former Premier
Yulia Tymoshenkoremains incarcerated, political leaders said.  Ukraine is working to sign an Association Agreement,which
includes a free-trade area with the EU, this year. Leaders of
the three largest former-communist EU members, meeting as the
Visegrad Group, said an accord is at risk after a Kiev court
convicted Tymoshenko on Oct. 11 of abuse of power and sentenced
her to seven years in prison.  “We cannot imagine a situation that we smoothly ratify the
Association Agreement with Ukraine when the legal system there
is not functioning and Tymoshenko is in prison,” Czech Prime
Minister Petr Necas told reporters in  Prague  today after Polish
Premier Donald Tusk and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.  Tymoshenko,50, was found guilty of abusing her position as
head of government when she signed a 10-year gas supply and
transit agreements with  Russia  in 2009.  Her imprisonment raises “very serious” questions about
how closely Ukraine complies with basic civil and human rights,
Necas said.  The premiers also called for Belarus, a former Soviet
Republic north of Ukraine, to improve its human rights record
and release political prisoners.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
