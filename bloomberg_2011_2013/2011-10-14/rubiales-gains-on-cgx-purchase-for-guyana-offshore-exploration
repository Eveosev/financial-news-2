Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , the
Canadian oil producer that operates fields in  Colombia , rose to
a three-week high after agreeing to buy a stake in CGX Energy
Inc., a Toronto-based exploration company with blocks in Guyana.  The shares rose 0.7 percent to 44,700 pesos, the highest
price since Sept. 21, at 3 p.m. Bogota time.  “Rubiales is diversifying its exploration portfolio,”
said Santiago Melo, an analyst at brokerage Alianza Valores SA.
“It’s yet to be seen if they’ll put up the exploration results
needed for this project to be taken into account.”  Rubiales said in a statement yesterday that it will buy
about 19 percent of CGX’s outstanding common shares for $41
million. CGX licenses in Guyana cover 8.6 million gross acres of
offshore and onshore fields.  Rubiales Chief Executive Officer Ronald Pantin said the
investment in CGX, which has blocks in the Guyana/Suriname
basin, is a “step forward into offshore opportunities in one of
the most prospective areas in the world.”  Rubiales signed a letter of intent Oct. 12 with Les
Etablissments Maurel & Prom SA for a 50 percent participation in
a field in northeastern  Peru , according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
