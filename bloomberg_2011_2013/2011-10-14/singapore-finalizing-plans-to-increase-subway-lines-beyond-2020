Singapore’s government said it is
finalizing plans to add more subways lines and extend existing
ones beyond 2020 in addition to the S$80 billion already
invested or committed.  It also plans to reduce the vehicle growth rate in the city
state to a “more sustainable” level because of constraints in
expanding the road network, the government said in a statement
elaborating on plans laid out by President Tony Tan in
parliament earlier this week.  The annual vehicle growth rate will be gradually lowered to
0.5 percent starting from August 2012 until 2014, from 1.5
percent a year now, Channel NewsAsia reported on its website,
without saying where it got the information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
