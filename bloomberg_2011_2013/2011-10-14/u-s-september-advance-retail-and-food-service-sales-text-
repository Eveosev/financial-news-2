Following is the text of the monthly
retail sales report from the Commerce Department.  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance
estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for September,
adjusted for seasonal variation and holiday and trading-day
differences, but not for price changes, were $395.5 billion, an
increase of 1.1 percent (+/-0.5%) from the previous month and 7.9
percent (+/-0.7%) above September 2010. Total sales for the July
through September 2011 period were up 8.0 percent (+/-0.7%) from
the same period a year ago. The July to August 2011 percent
change was revised from virtually unchanged (+/-0.5%)* to +0.3
percent (+/-0.2%).  Retail trade sales were up 1.1 percent (+/-0.5%) from August
2011, and 8.1 percent (+/-0.7%) above last year. Gasoline
stations sales were up 20.3 percent (+/-1.7%) from September 2010
and nonstore retailers sales were up 10.1 percent (+/-2.3%) from
last year.  The advance estimates are based on a subsample of the Census
Bureau's full retail and food services sample. A stratified
random sampling method is used to select approximately 5,000
retail and food services firms whose sales are then weighted and
benchmarked to represent the complete universe of over three
million retail and food services firms. Responding firms account
for approximately 65% of the MARTS dollar volume estimate.  For an explanation of the measures of sampling variability
included in this report, please see the Reliability of Estimates
section on the last page of this publication.  The Advance Monthly Sales for Retail and Food Services for
October is scheduled to be released November 15, 2011 at 8:30
a.m. EST.  For information, visit the Census Bureau's Web site at

Bureau does not have sufficient statistical evidence to conclude
that the actual change is different than zero.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department
