India ’s 10-year bonds completed the
worst week since January, pushing yields to a three-year high,
on concern inflation near a 13-month high and increased debt
sales will damp demand for debt.  The commerce ministry reported today the wholesale-price
index rose 9.72 percent in September from a year earlier after a
9.78 percent increase in August, which was the most since July
2010. The pace of price gains is above the central bank’s
“comfort level,” Governor Duvvuri Subbarao said yesterday.
Underwriters picked up 40.4 billion rupees of unsold securities
as the government raised 130 billion rupees ($2.7 billion) at an
auction today, signaling demand for the notes weakened.  “Inflation is still at elevated levels, so there is a
threat of one more interest-rate increase,” said R.S. Chauhan,
a Mumbai-based chief dealer of currencies and  fixed income  at
 State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur in Mumbai. “Investors are
generally bearish on bonds as debt supply is heavy.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose 20
basis points, or 0.20 percentage point, this week to 8.78
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. That is the highest level for benchmark 10-year rates
since August 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
rate climbed six basis points today.  The 10-year yield has increased 34 basis points since the
government boosted its bond-sale target for the six months
through March 2012 by 32 percent on Sept. 29.  The  Reserve Bank  of India, which raised  interest rates  six
times this year to slow price gains, will review borrowing costs
next on Oct. 25.  Appetite Waning  Bids for 10-year bonds at today’s auction were 1.79 times
the amount on offer, the lowest level in two months, according
to Bloomberg calculations based on central bank data.  “Investors are demanding higher yields as there is a glut
of debt supplies ahead,” said Killol Pandya, the Mumbai-based
head of fixed-income investments at Daiwa Asset Management
(India) Pvt.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
rose 26 basis points this week to 8.20 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. It rose 13 basis points today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
