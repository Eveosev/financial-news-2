Defensive end Justin Tuck and
running back  Brandon Jacobs  won’t play this weekend when the New
York Giants host the  Buffalo Bills  at MetLife Stadium.  Tuck, 28, will miss his third consecutive National Football
League game with neck and groin injuries, Giants spokesman Peter
John-Baptiste said today in an e-mail.  Tuck told reporters yesterday that he was frustrated to
have missed so many games.  “You definitely want to be out there helping your
teammates win,” Tuck said. “Being around the guys and seeing
them go out and battle from the sideline is tough.”  Jacobs sat out last weekend’s loss to the  Seattle Seahawks 
with a left knee injury and will miss the team’s Oct. 16 game
against Buffalo, John-Baptiste said. The 29-year-old has rushed
for 116 yards and two touchdowns in four games this season.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
