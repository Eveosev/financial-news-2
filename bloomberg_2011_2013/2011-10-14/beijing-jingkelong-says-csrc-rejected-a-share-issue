Beijing Jingkelong Co., a Hong Kong-
listed supermarket operator, said its plan to sell shares in
 Shanghai  was rejected by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission.  The Public Offering Review Committee of CSRC did not
approve its application after a review, Beijing Jingkelong said
in a statement to the  Hong Kong  stock exchange today, without
giving other details.  “There will not be any material adverse effect on the
financial position or the operation of the company,” it said.  Beijing Jingkelong sought to raise funds selling yuan-
denominated A-shares as the Shanghai Composite Index slid 13
percent this year on concern that slowing global growth will cut
demand for exports and amid reports small and medium-sized
domestic companies are facing a credit squeeze.  China’s securities regulator may slow approvals for share
sales, 21st Century Business Herald reported on Sept. 22. The
CSRC aimed to support Sinohydro Group Ltd.’s initial public
offering, the paper said. The company raised 13.5 billion yuan
($2.1 billion) Sept. 29 and trading in the shares may begin
around Oct. 18, the paper said yesterday.  Calls to CSRC and Beijing Jingkelong were unanswered.  The retailer, which operates about 246 stores around the
capital, said on Oct. 10 it planned to use proceeds from the
share sale to expand its shopping center and hypermaket network
in  China .  “The company will use its internal resources or other
means to finance the projects,” according to today’s statement.  The stock rose 3.9 percent to close at HK$7.69 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
