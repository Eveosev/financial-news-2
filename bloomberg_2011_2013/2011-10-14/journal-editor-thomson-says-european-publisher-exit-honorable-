Robert Thomson, managing editor of
the Wall Street Journal, said European Publisher
Andrew Langhoff “did the honorable thing” by resigning amid
questions over editorial integrity.  “There was the perception of pressure” on the editorial
staff to influence coverage, Thomson said today at a business
journalists’ event in  New York . “There has to be a clear line
between church and state,” he said.  Langhoff, 49, quit this week as publisher of the Journal’s
European edition. He cited a possible perception of impropriety
involving two articles that originated with a sponsor, Executive
Learning Partnership. The  Guardian newspaper  reported ELP was
part of a broader effort to inflate circulation, a charge
Journal parent  News Corp. (NWSA)  has rejected.  Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with
News Corp. units in providing financial news and information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
