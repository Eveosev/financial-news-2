Germany  and  France  share common
positions and “are working together to protect our common
currency,” German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said.  France and Germany are agreed on the need for higher
capital requirements for banks, Schaeuble said, speaking after
lunching with French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and Finance
Minister  Francois Baroin  in Paris.  Baroin said Germany and France have made “advances” on
coming up with a “durable, complete package to stabilize the
 euro zone ” to be agreed by European governments on Oct. 23.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
