Ghana , the world’s second-biggest
cocoa producer after  Ivory Coast , set the minimum price that
farmers will be paid for their beans at 3,280 cedis ($2,000) a
metric ton for the 2011-12 harvest, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said.  The price of the beans has been falling on global markets
and the government has “sacrificed part of its export tax
share” to help farmers, Duffuor said today at a news conference
in Accra, the capital.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
