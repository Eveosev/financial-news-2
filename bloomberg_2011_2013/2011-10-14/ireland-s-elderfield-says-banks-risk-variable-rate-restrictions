Ireland’s bailed-out banks face
restrictions on their ability to increase variable home-loan
rates, if their actions worsen the mortgage arrears situation,
according to Matthew Elderfield, the country’s head of
financial regulation.  “If the banks continue to act in a way which is so
damaging to customers” they risk a “response involving powers
to impose direct restrictions on their rate-setting capacity by
the competition or financial regulation authorities,”
Elderfield said in an e-mailed speech in Cork, southern Ireland
today.  Banks that received state capital injections must provide
an impact analysis of proposed rate increase on arrears and
future cash needs, Elderfield said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
