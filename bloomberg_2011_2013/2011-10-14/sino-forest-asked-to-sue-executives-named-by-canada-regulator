Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) , the China tree-
plantation operator accused of fraud, said it received a request
from a shareholder to start to sue certain executives barred by
the Ontario Securities Commission from trading the shares.  “The request indicated that, if the company does not agree
to commence legal proceedings as demanded, the purported
shareholder may seek court approval to commence such proceedings
in the name of the company,” Sino-Forest said today in a
statement.  The OSC,  Canada ’s main securities watchdog, suspended
trading of Sino-Forest shares on Aug. 26 and said some officers
and directors of Sino-Forest may have engaged in acts “related
to its securities” that they “knew or should have known”
perpetuated a fraud.  The OSC also ordered then-Chief Executive Officer  Allen Chan  and Vice Presidents Albert Ip, Alfred C.T. Hung, George Ho,
and Simon Yeung from trading company shares.  Short seller Carson Block’s Muddy Waters LLC published a
report on June 2 alleging that Sino-Forest, based in  Hong Kong 
and Mississauga, Ontario, overstated its China timberland
holdings. Sino-Forest executives have denied the allegations.  Sino-Forest has established an independent committee of
directors to examine and respond to the Muddy Waters report. The
company said Aug. 15 the investigation would take until the end
of the year to complete.  Stan Neve, a New-York-based external spokesman for Sino-
Forest, said company executives wouldn’t comment on the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
