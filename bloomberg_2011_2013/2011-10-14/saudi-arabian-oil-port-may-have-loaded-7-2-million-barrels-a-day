The largest crude  oil tankers  that
can carry about 7.2 million barrels a day went to  Saudi Arabia ’s
Ras Tanura, the world’s largest export facility, ship-tracking
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Very large crude carriers, or VLCCs, with a combined
capacity of about 6.9 million deadweight tons were at the
terminal from Oct. 2 to Oct. 8. To estimate that tonnage in
terms of barrels a day, the figure was first multiplied by 7.33
to calculate the total barrels and then divided by seven, the
number of days in the period.  Japan  will get the largest share of shipments loaded during
the seven-day period for a second straight week. Six VLCCs with
a combined capacity of 13 million barrels of crude are sailing
for the country after loading at  Ras Tanura . Shipments of crude
to  Singapore  from Ras Tanura totaled 4.4 million barrels, down
15 percent from 5.2 million barrels in the previous seven-day
period, the data show.  Following are the ships loading in Saudi Arabia, the
companies that hired them and estimated times of arrival, where
data are available. Drafts are expressed as a percentage of
maximum sailing depth and are an indication of cargo size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
