Treasury Secretary  Timothy F.
Geithner  said the U.S. has a “huge interest” in  Europe  solving
its sovereign-debt crisis.  “If Europe has a comprehensive strategy in place that
looks like it makes sense, and is using the very ample financial
resources of Europe, then we’re happy to see the IMF play a
continuing role,” he said in a CNBC interview in Paris today.
“We have a huge interest in Europe getting ahead of this and
fixing it.”  He also said that any U.S. assistance for Europe will come
through the IMF, CNBC reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
