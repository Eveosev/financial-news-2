The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
fall as much as 42 percent, according to Bob Janjuah, Nomura
Holdings Inc.’s global head of tactical asset allocation.  Janjuah, who predicted in March 2009 the rally that began
that month would reverse and the  S&P 500  would fall as low as
500, said in a Bloomberg television interview today that the
next two to three weeks may see “another risk-off phase.” The
benchmark index for American equities may slip as low as 700 in
2012, he wrote in a report on Oct. 3.  The forecast is 51 percent below the average projection
from four Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg. U.S.
stock futures rose today, indicating the S&P 500 may extend its
longest streak of weekly gains in three months.  Janjuah, then a strategist for Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, said in an e-mail dated March 31, 2009, that the S&P 500
might fall to between 500 and 550 that year, from just above 800
at the time. Instead, the index climbed more than 70 percent
through the end of April 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
