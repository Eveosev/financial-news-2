Petroleos Mexicanos has reached the
9.49 percent stake it targeted in  Repsol YPF SA (REP) , taking its
combined holding with  Sacyr Vallehermoso SA (SYV)  to 29.5 percent, the
two companies said in a regulatory filing.  According to the latest public information, Repsol holds no
treasury stock, meaning those percentages are equivalent to
voting rights, the companies said in  Madrid  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
