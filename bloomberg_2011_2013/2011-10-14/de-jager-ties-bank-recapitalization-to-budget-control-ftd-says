Dutch Finance Minister  Jan Kees de Jager  said he will tie his approval of an expansion of the
region’s rescue fund and its use to recapitalize banks to more
control over debt-strapped countries’ budgets,  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing an interview.  “We will only approve bank recapitalizations through the
rescue fund EFSF or its expansion if our request for more
control is met at the next summit,”  de Jager  told the newspaper
in an interview. De Jager envisages the creation of a special
commission to monitor countries breaching the region’s budget
rules and dictate fiscal policy if needed, FTD reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
