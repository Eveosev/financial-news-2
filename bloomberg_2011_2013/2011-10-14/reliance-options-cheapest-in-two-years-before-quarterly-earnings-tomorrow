Options protecting against losses in
 Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL)  shares fell to the lowest in two years
before India’s most valuable company reports earnings tomorrow.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for
one-month options is 7.37 points below historical volatility for
the past month, near the lowest on a relative basis since
November 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
spread reached a two-year low of 12.16 points on Sept. 20, the
data show.  Earnings for Reliance have missed analysts’ forecasts for
two of the last three quarters. Its shares have slumped 18
percent this year, compared with the 17 percent drop in the BSE
India Sensitive Index, as the Mumbai-based company struggled to
reverse a drop in natural-gas output from  India ’s biggest field.  “Markets are hinting that the worst may be over for the
stock,” Gaurav Mehta, derivatives strategist at Ambit Capital
Pvt., said in a phone interview yesterday. “Lower risk of an
earnings surprise is leading to a drop in implied volatility.”  Reliance will report tomorrow a net income of 57.2 billion
rupees ($1.2 billion) for the three months ended Sept. 30, up
from 49.2 billion a year ago, according to the median estimate
of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That would be the most
since the three months ended Dec. 31, 2007.  The stock’s 30-day implied volatility has declined 17
percent to 36.56 yesterday from this year’s peak of 44.36 on
Oct. 4, Bloomberg data show. The historical volatility has
fallen to 43.93 from this year’s peak of 49.50 in September.  India VIX  The shares jumped 2.4 percent to 866.9 rupees as of the
3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the highest price in more than two
months. They have risen 8 percent this week, the most since the
five-day period ended Sept. 2. The Sensex gained 1.2 percent.  The India VIX, which gauges the cost of buying protection
against losses in the S&P CNX Nifty Index, slumped 8 percent to
25.98. The gauge has plunged 30 percent from a two-year high of
37.19 on Oct. 4.  Reliance and BP Plc, which owns 30 percent of the KG-D6  gas
field , may need up to four years to increase output as the block
is harder to tap than previously estimated, a person with direct
knowledge of the matter said Sept. 22. Reliance, controlled by
billionaire  Mukesh Ambani , has sought Indian government’s
permission to develop smaller areas to counter a drop from the
reservoir, the person said.  Satellite fields in the KG-D6 block and the R-Series fields
together have the potential to produce as much as 35 million
cubic meters a day of gas, the person said. That would boost
output by 78 percent from the current level of 45 million cubic
meters a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
