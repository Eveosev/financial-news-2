Ghana ’s cedi headed for the weakest
on record as companies bought dollars and foreign investors
sought the U.S. currency to convert earnings from bonds.  The currency of West Africa’s biggest economy after  Nigeria 
depreciated as much as 0.5 percent to 1.6399 per dollar before
paring the loss to 1.6396 by 2:27 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
taking its retreat this week to 1.4 percent, a seventh week of
declines. A close at this level will be the weakest since May
31, 1994, when Bloomberg began tracking the data.  Ghana’s three-year borrowing costs rose to 14 percent at an
auction yesterday, the highest in more than a year, with the
central bank allocating 200 million cedis ($122 million), or 51
percent of bids, it said in a statement today.  “Most of the bonds were picked up by local investors who
already had cedis,” Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader at the
local unit of Barclays Bank Plc said in a telephone interview.
“There was still dollar buying by companies as well as foreign
investors, who were either converting coupons or proceeds of
bonds sold.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
