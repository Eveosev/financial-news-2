Investor demand for  India ’s 10-year
bonds in relation to debt on offer at auctions was the lowest in
two months as inflation near a 13-month high and increased debt
sales deterred buyers.  Lack of investor interest prompted primary dealers to
purchase the unsold  government securities  for a second straight
auction. They bought 31.1 percent, or 40.4 billion rupees ($824
million), of the 130 billion rupees of notes offered, the
central bank said. The government sold 40 billion rupees of 2018
bonds, 60 billion rupees of the 2021 note and 30 billion rupees
of 2027 debt.  Inflation exceeded 9 percent for a 10th straight month in
September, maintaining pressure on the central bank to extend
its record interest-rate increases. The  Reserve Bank  of India
has boosted borrowing costs six times this year. The 10-year
yield has increased 35 basis points since the government boosted
its bond-sale target for the six months through March by 32
percent on Sept. 29.  “Investors are demanding higher yields as there is a glut
of debt supplies ahead,” said Killol Pandya, the Mumbai-based
head of fixed-income investments at Daiwa Asset Management
(India) Pvt. “Inflation is also at elevated levels.”  The yield on the 7.8 percent notes due April 2021 rose 7
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.79 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system.  The ratio at the 10-year auction was 1.79 today, the lowest
since August 12, according to Bloomberg calculations based on
central bank data.  India sold the 2018 bond at a yield of 8.7939 percent per
100 rupee face amount, the central bank said. It also auctioned
the 2021 notes at 8.7844 percent and 2027 bonds at 8.9491
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
