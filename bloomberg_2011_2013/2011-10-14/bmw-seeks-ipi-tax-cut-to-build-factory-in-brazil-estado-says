Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW)  asked
 Brazil ’s Trade and Development Minister Fernando Pimentel to
reevaluate the increase in the so-called IPI tax as it considers
building a factory in the country, O Estado de S. Paulo
reported, citing Henning Dornbusch, chief executive officer of
BMW’s Brazil unit.  The Brazilian government’s decision to raise the tax on
cars with less than 65 percent of their parts produced in Brazil
may lead BMW to build its plant in China, India or Russia
instead, according to the newspaper. The company will announce
its decision by November, O Estado said.  The Ministry of Trade and Development’s press office said
Pimentel hasn’t made any commitment relating to BMW’s request
because the decision must be made in conjunction with Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega , O Estado said.   To contact the reporter on this story:
