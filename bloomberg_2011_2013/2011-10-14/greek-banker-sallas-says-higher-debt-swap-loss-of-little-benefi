Piraeus Bank Chairman Michalis Sallas said talk of increasing the loss borne by bondholders to
50 percent under a planned voluntary swap of Greek debt would
result in few savings and force the Greek state to resort to
more borrowing from international creditors.  “The benefit would be about 20 billion euros to 25 billion
euros,” Sallas, the head of the country’s fourth-biggest bank,
said in an e-mailed statement today. “ Greece  will be forced
again to resort to European countries and the IMF for loans to
boost its social security funds and recapitalise its banks.”  Sallas said Greek banks, pension funds and insurance
companies made up more than half the investors who had pledged
to take part in the swap, which proposed a 21 percent writedown.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
