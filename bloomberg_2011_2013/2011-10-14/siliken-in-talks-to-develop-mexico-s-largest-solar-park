Siliken SA, a Spanish solar park
developer and panel maker, plans to build a $300 million
photovoltaic plant in the northern state of Durango that would
be  Mexico ’s largest.  The company has signed a 30-year land lease for the 100-
megawatt solar park in Canatlan and is talking to local
companies interested in buying its electricity, Siliken
spokeswoman Izaskun Goya said today. The project, which would be
built in four phases from mid-2012, has the support of the state
government and could get permits in five months, she said.  Spanish solar companies are pioneering the development of
projects in  Latin America  as they strive to open new markets
after demand in the country tumbled in late 2009 due to policy
changes. In early 2010, OPDE Group said it aimed to develop 45
megawatts in solar parks in Durango and T-Solar Global SA won a
tender to build 80 megawatts in  Peru .  Mexico has 1.2 megawatts of solar capacity in operation and
about 60 megawatts under development, Bloomberg New Energy
Finance data shows.  As the country does not offer European-style guaranteed
premium rates for solar power, Siliken is looking for companies
or institutions to buy the energy. Aguas de Durango, a local
water utility, is likely to buy the equivalent of 30 megawatts
in capacity, Goya said by phone.  The panels for the company’s first project in Latin America
will be provided by its manufacturing plant in Tijuana, northern
Mexico, which opened in May. Valencia-based Siliken has four
other assembly plants in  Spain , Ontario and  Romania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
