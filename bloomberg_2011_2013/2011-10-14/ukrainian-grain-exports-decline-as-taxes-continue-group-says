Ukrainian grain exports fell this
month as taxes on shipments remained in effect, the country’s
Agrarian Confederation said.  Deliveries slid to 400,000 metric tons in October’s first
13 days from 830,000 tons a month earlier, Sergey Stoianov,
director of the producers’ group, said by e-mail late yesterday.
The decline stemmed mainly from the continuation of the taxes,
he said.  Ukraine’s parliament voted Oct. 7 to cancel duties on wheat
and corn exports as of Jan. 1, while maintaining a tax on barley
shipments. President  Viktor Yanukovych  has yet to sign the
measure, a requirement for it to take effect.  To contact the reporter on this story:
