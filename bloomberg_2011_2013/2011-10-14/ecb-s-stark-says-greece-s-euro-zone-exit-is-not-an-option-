Exiting the euro zone is “not an
option” for  Greece , European Central Bank Executive Board
member Juergen Stark said.  “I always say it’s not a 100-meter run, it’s a marathon
run for Greece, so it will take time,” Stark said in an
interview broadcast on Latvian radio today. “We should not lose
patience, and also the Greek government should not lose patience
in the implementation.”  Greece has already “done a lot” to reduce the size of its
budget deficit, Stark said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
