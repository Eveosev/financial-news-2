Kenya  raised the maximum price of
super petrol, the most commonly used gasoline, by 2.3 percent to
120.5 shillings ($1.21) per liter in Nairobi after the shilling
weakened against the dollar, the industry regulator said.  The increase is effective from tomorrow through to Nov. 14,
the Energy Regulatory Commission said in its monthly review of
fuel costs from Nairobi, Kenya’s capital.  “The local currency has depreciated relative to the  U.S.
dollar  and this has impacted negatively on local pump prices,”
the regulator said in an e-mailed statement.  The price of diesel increases by 2.77 shillings per liter
to a maximum of 110.94 shillings, and kerosene, which is used
for cooking, rises by 1.66 shillings per liter to 89.95
shillings, it said.  Higher fuel prices in  East Africa ’s largest economy have
been one of the main drivers of inflation, which accelerated for
the 11th consecutive month in September to 17.3 percent, more
than triple the government’s 5 percent target.  The shilling has weakened 19 percent against the dollar
this year, making it the world’s worst-performing currency. It
was trading at 99.75 per dollar at 4:26 p.m. in Nairobi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
