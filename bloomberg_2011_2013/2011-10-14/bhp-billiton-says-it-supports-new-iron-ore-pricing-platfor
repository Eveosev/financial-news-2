BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
largest mining company, said it’s supporting development of a
new pricing platform for  iron ore , known as globalORE, and may
become a founding shareholder.  “ BHP Billiton  is one of a number of industry participants
including end users who are supportive of such a development and
who may become founding shareholders,” the Melbourne-based
company said today in an e-mailed statement. “It would bring
further transparency to iron-ore pricing, would increase
physical market liquidity and would generally make for a more
robust market index,” BHP said.  According to its  website , globalORE is seeking to develop a
standard contract for physical iron ore to be traded on its
online platform by producers, consumers and traders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
