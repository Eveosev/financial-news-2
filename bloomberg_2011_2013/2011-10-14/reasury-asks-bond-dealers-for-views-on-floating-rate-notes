The U.S. Treasury Department asked
bond dealers for their newest fiscal and economic forecasts for
2012 and 2013 and for recommendations on how it could issue
floating-rate notes.  The survey, released in a statement today, is for an Oct.
28 meeting between Treasury officials and Wall Street bond
dealers in advance of next month’s quarterly auctions of notes
and bonds.  The Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, which includes
officials from  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS) ,
suggested in February that the department consider issuing
floating-rate notes. In the survey, the Treasury asks dealers to
comment “on the optimal structure for such a product, how it
would affect Treasury’s overall cost of borrowing and whether
you expect robust market demand for such a product.”  The Treasury also asked dealers whether the current auction
schedule is suited to meet U.S. financing needs.  The department said some bill auctions have closed with an
interest rate of zero and bills have traded at negative rates in
the secondary market.  The survey asks, “should Treasury consider allowing
negative rate bidding in bill auctions?”  To contact the reporter on this story:
