Greece  set a maximum limit for the
cost to buy car fuel after the start of a strike by custom
officials led to price increases.  Greek customs workers declared a 10-day strike from today,
to protest planned wage and pension cuts, threatening fuel
supplies because delivery from refineries in Greece to petrol
stations needs clearance from customs.  “Statistical data for all consumer petroleum products from
across the country showed an increase in retail prices which is
not the result of refining price hikes,” Deputy Development
Minister Socratis Xinidis said in a  statement  that was e-mailed
today from his Athens-based ministry.  The price cap, effective from tomorrow, was set at 1.643
euros ($2.27) a liter for 95-octane unleaded petrol in the
Athens region and 1.458 euros a liter for  diesel fuel . The
corresponding prices in the second-largest city of Thessaloniki
were 1.627 euros and 1.444 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
