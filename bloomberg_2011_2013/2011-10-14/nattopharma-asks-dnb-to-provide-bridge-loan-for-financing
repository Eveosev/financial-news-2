NattoPharma ASA (NATTO)  asked its bank DnB
NOR Bank ASA to provide it with a bridge-loan based on certain
requirements as to security for financing.  The company together with Fondsfinans is in the process of
fulfilling theses requirements and expects this to be finalized
during week 42/43.  The company will hold an extraordinary
general meeting on Oct. 31 as it plans to raise its share
capital with 15 million to 20 million kroner.   “Until the bridge-loan has been established the company is
not in a position to fulfill all of its financial obligations,”
it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
