Corn, soybean and wheat futures rose
on speculation that  China  will step up grain purchases to damp
food inflation.  China  bought U.S. corn, soybeans and wheat last week, data
from the Department of Agriculture show. The agency yesterday
 reported  that U.S. exporters sold an additional 900,000 tons of
corn to the Asian nation. Food prices in China rose 13 percent
last month from a year earlier, the government said today.  “China is buying and will continue to buy to push down
domestic prices,”  Roy Huckabay , an executive vice president at
the Linn Group in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.
“There’s no slowdown in global demand for food.”  Corn futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$6.3925 a bushel at 10:45 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. A
close at that price would mark a gain of 6.5 percent, the most
since mid-July.  Soybean futures for November delivery rose 0.4 percent to
$12.615 a bushel on the CBOT. A close at that price would mark a
weekly gain of 8.9 percent, the most since October 2009.  Wheat futures for December delivery advanced 0.1 percent to
$6.185 a bushel in Chicago.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest at $13 billion, behind hay.  To contact the reporter on this story:
