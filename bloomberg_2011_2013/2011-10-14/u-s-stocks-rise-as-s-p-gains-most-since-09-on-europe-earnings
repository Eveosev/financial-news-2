U.S. stocks rose, driving the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the largest weekly gain since
July 2009, amid optimism over corporate earnings and steps by
European leaders to support the region’s banks.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) ,  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  and DuPont Co. jumped at
least 7.6 percent to lead the  Dow Jones Industrial Average ,
which rallied a third straight week, the longest stretch since
April, and erased its 2011 loss. Energy, raw-material and
technology shares led gains by all 10 industries in the S&P 500
and added at least 7.5 percent.  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  closed at a record
high and Google Inc. completed a nine-day streak of gains.  The S&P 500 climbed 6 percent this week to 1,224.58, the
highest level since Aug. 3. The measure has surged 11 percent
since Oct. 3, when it closed within 1 percent of a  bear market ,
or 20 percent plunge, from its high in April. The Dow rose
541.37 points, or 4.9 percent, to 11,644.49 this week.  “It’s cautious but a little more optimistic,”  John Carey ,
a Boston-based  money manager  at Pioneer Investments, said in a
telephone interview. The firm oversees about $250 billion.
“People are shifting their attentions back toward earnings with
announcements under way this week. They’re hopeful that, at
least for now, disaster can be averted in  Europe .”  Stocks rallied the most since August on Oct. 10 after
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said they will deliver a plan to recapitalize European
banks by Nov. 3. The Group of 20 began talks yesterday to
address the debt crisis. The  S&P 500  has rebounded after dipping
below 1,100 in early October for the first time in more than a
year and posting its biggest quarterly loss since the end of
2008.  Retail Sales  The S&P 500 extended its weekly advance yesterday, rising
1.7 percent, after a report on U.S. retail sales beat estimates.  The Citigroup Economic Surprise Index for the U.S. turned
positive for the first time since April 29, the day the S&P 500
peaked at an almost three-year high. It climbed to 2.2, up from
minus 117.20 on June 3. The reading four months ago showed
reports were missing the median economist projection in
Bloomberg surveys by the most since January 2009.  Corporate earnings helped drive U.S. stocks higher this
week.  Alcoa Inc. (AA) , the first company in the Dow to report results
for the third quarter, announced earnings that trailed analysts’
projections, while Google Inc. jumped the most in a week since
April 2008 after sales and profit beat estimates. The owner of
the world’s most popular search engine rallied 15 percent to
$591.68.  Less Fear  “The systemic fear is definitely subsiding,” Robert Carey, chief investment officer at First Trust Portfolios LP,
said in a telephone interview. The Wheaton, Illinois-based firm
oversees about $46 billion. “We’ve got earnings coming in
better than expected, and valuations are quite low on a price-
to-earnings basis, so there really isn’t a lot of downside risk
to the market.”  Profit for S&P 500 companies will climb 17 percent in the
third quarter and rise 18 percent to a record $99.77 for all of
2011, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The
S&P 500 is trading for 11.1 times forecast earnings for 2012,
compared with its five-decade average of 16.4 times reported
income, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  It’s time to “extend risk,”  Jonathan Golub , chief U.S.
market strategist at UBS AG, wrote in a note dated Oct. 10. “As
macro concerns subside, stocks which have experienced the
greatest price declines are likely to snap back the quickest.”  Most Since 2009  Golub said industrial, raw-material and energy shares are
the most attractive. Those groups are among the ones that fell
the most since the S&P 500 dropped from a three-year high at the
end of April. This week, the Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index
advanced 8.5 percent, the biggest gain since July 2009.
Caterpillar surged 11 percent to $84.09.  Walt Disney  added 8.7
percent to $34.47. DuPont climbed 7.6 percent to $45.09.  Energy stocks rallied the most out of 10 groups in the S&P
500 this week. Crude oil rose to a three-week high as the S&P
GSCI Index of 24 commodities jumped the most in 10 months.

biggest gain in the S&P 500.  Range Resources Corp. (RRC)  climbed 21
percent to $72.46.  Apple surged 14 percent to $422. The world’s biggest
technology company by market value released the iPhone 4S in the

may reach as much as 4 million units this weekend, according to
Boston-based Yankee Group.  Google jumped 15 percent to $591.68. Demand for online
advertising vaulted third-quarter sales at the world’s biggest
Internet-search company past analysts’ estimates.  Harman International Industries Inc. (HAR)  soared 23 percent, the
most in the S&P 500, to $37.47. Relational Investors LLC, the
money manager run by activist investor Ralph Whitworth, boosted
its stake in the maker of audio systems for homes and vehicles
to 3.86 percent and urged the company to add independent
directors.  Liz Claiborne Inc. (LIZ)  surged 63 percent, a record weekly gain,
to $7.60. It announced a plan to sell brands including its
namesake to J.C. Penney Co. and rename the company to focus on
