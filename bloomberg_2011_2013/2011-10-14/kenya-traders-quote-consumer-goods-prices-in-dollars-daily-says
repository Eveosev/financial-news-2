CMC Holdings Ltd. (CMCH) , Toyota Kenya and
other auto traders have begun quoting prices of their vehicles
in dollars to cushion against the impact of the shilling’s
decline against the U.S. currency, Business Daily reported.  Importers of heavy machinery and retailers of information-
technology products also switched their prices from shillings to
protect themselves against currency volatility, the Nairobi-
based newspaper said, citing executives including CMC Managing
Director Bill Lay.  The shilling is the world’s worst-performing currency this
year, having weakened 21 percent against the dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
