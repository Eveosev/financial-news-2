Accor SA (AC) ,  Europe ’s largest hotel
company, is embarking on a push to expand in the Asia-Pacific
region, with plans to add more than 200 hotels by 2014.  With 40 percent of its global pipeline of hotels in the
region, the Paris-based company will focus on  China ,  India  and
Indonesia, Michael Issenberg, Asia-Pacific chairman of Accor,
said in a telephone interview.  “China and India are very important for us,” Issenberg
said. “But we’re also having success in other parts of the
Asia-Pacific, like Indonesia. Other growth markets for us are
Australia and Vietnam.”  The  group , which has 450 of its 4,000 hotels in the Asia-
Pacific region, is adding more as demand for travel increases.
Asia-Pacific airline carriers will post a profit of $2.5 billion
in 2011, up from a June forecast of $2.1 billion,  International
Air Transport Association  said last month.  The company plans to open 63 hotels in India by 2014,
including its first Sofitel, its luxury brand; Formula 1, a
budget chain, and Pullman, its upscale business hotel, in
December, Issenberg said. It also plans to add 35 to its
existing network of 40 in Indonesia by 2015, he said.  In China, the group will add 60 hotels to its current 108,
and it is seeking to take over the management of more hotels in
Australia, where it signed 18 management and franchise contracts
this year, Issenberg said.  Accor also plans to reduce the number of hotels it owns
globally as part of its “asset-light” strategy, said Issenberg.
The company, which owned or leased about 60 percent of the
hotels it managed globally in 2004, is seeking to bring that
proportion down to 20 percent, mostly by selling hotels in
Europe and  North America  while continuing to manage them,
Issenberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
