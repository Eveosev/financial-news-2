Posco (005490) , the world’s third-biggest
steelmaker, sold 41.4 billion yen ($538 million) of Samurai
bonds, paying a higher relative yield than initially planned
amid concern Europe’s debt crisis will derail global growth.  Posco, based in Pohang,  South Korea , offered 30 billion yen
of three-year, 1.67 percent bonds priced to yield 125 basis
points more than the yen swap rate, and 11.4 billion yen of
five-year, 2.03 percent notes at a spread of 150 basis points,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Initial price guidance
on the five-year tranche was between 100 and 140 basis points, a
person with direct knowledge of the matter said Oct. 4.  The extra yield investors demand to own Samurai bonds
instead of Japanese government debt has almost doubled to 144
basis points from this year’s low of 74 on June 15, according to
a Nomura Securities Co. index. Government-owned  Korea
Development Bank  raised 53.7 billion yen in a four-part offering
of Samurai bonds on Oct. 12, paying a spread of 140 basis points
on the five-year tranche, Bloomberg data show.  “Investors weren’t satisfied” with Posco’s initial price
guidance and wanted a wider spread than  Korea  Development Bank
offered,  Toshiaki Takahashi , who manages 340 billion yen at
Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Co., said in a telephone interview
from  Tokyo  today. While KDB “isn’t involved with Europe’s most-
indebted countries, as a financial institution its spreads got
wider because of the risk-off trend. Posco is also from Korea
and is a private-sector company,” said Takahashi, who bought
the steelmaker’s notes.  Chung Jae Woong, a spokesman for Posco, had no immediate
comment on the sale details when contacted by telephone at the
company’s head office today.  Previous Sale  Posco last issued Samurai bonds, or yen-denominated debt
sold in  Japan  by an overseas borrower, in 2006, Bloomberg data
show. The steelmaker then raised 50 billion yen from a sale of
seven-year, 2.05 percent bonds at a spread of 32 basis points.  Sales of Samurai bonds by Korean borrowers have totaled a
record 370 billion yen this year, the data show.  Overseas borrowing costs have surged for Korean companies
this half, with average yields on dollar debt rising 63 basis
points to 4.18 percent, according to HSBC Holdings Plc data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
