Jupiter Fund Management Plc (JUP) , the
U.K. fund manager that first sold shares to the public last
year, said assets under management dropped 10 percent after the
August stock market rout.  Assets under management dropped to 22.3 billion pounds ($35
billion) in the three months to Sept. 30, the London-based firm
said in a statement today. That beat the 21.9 billion-pound
estimate of analysts at Numis Securities Ltd. because clients
added 295 million pounds of new money, more than expected.  This was “a credible performance in the core U.K. mutual
fund business, which saw positive net flows, representing a
decent outperformance versus most U.K. peers over this period,”
David McCann, a London-based analyst at Numis, wrote in a note
to clients today.  Jupiter’s fall in assets under management was smaller than
the 14 percent decline in the  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  of leading U.K.
companies, which had its worst quarter for nine years as the
European debt crisis worsened and concern increased that global
growth is slowing. Jupiter has three-quarters of its assets in
mutual funds that are predominately invested in equities.  “Volatile markets continue to impact on investor
confidence and flows across the asset management sector,
particularly in  Europe ,” Jupiter said in the statement.
“Despite this, we continue to believe in the long-term growth
prospects for the savings market.”  The stock climbed as much as 4.8 percent in London trading
and was up 0.2 percent at 206.1 pence as of 8:55 a.m. The shares
were first sold to the public in June 2010 for 165 pence.  Jupiter also said it intends to pay down 60 million pounds
of a bank loan facility on Oct. 31, reducing the outstanding
balance to 143 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
