General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) , the
No 2. U.S. mall owner, sold Faneuil Hall Marketplace, a shopping
and dining complex in  Boston , for $140 million.  The transaction was one of three sales of “non-core”
assets completed in the last three months, the Chicago-based
company said in a statement today. General Growth also sold the
office and garage components of Westlake Center in  Seattle  for
$119 million and Riverside Plaza, a strip shopping center in
Provo,  Utah , for $21 million. The buyers weren’t disclosed.  “We continue to execute our investment strategy of
focusing on our regional mall portfolio,” Shobi Khan, General
Growth’s chief operating officer, said in the statement. “These
recent dispositions strengthen our balance sheet.”  The deals helped the company eliminate $95 million of
mortgage-related debt associated with the properties, according
to the statement.  General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, is the second biggest U.S. shopping mall owner after
Simon Property Group Inc. In August, General Growth said it
would spin off 30 malls to shareholders through a special
dividend and that they would be transferred to a new publicly
traded real estate investment trust, Rouse Properties Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
