Allos Therapeutics Inc. (ALTH) , maker of
the blood-cancer drug Folotyn, said it reached a settlement of
lawsuits opposing its planned $195 million acquisition by  AMAG
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMAG)   The parties entered into a memorandum of understanding,
under which Allos will submit a regulatory filing with amended
and increased information, Westminster, Colorado-based Allos
said yesterday in a statement.  AMAG, based in Lexington,  Massachusetts , is working with
Allos to complete an all-stock acquisition valued at $2.44 a
share when the deal was announced in July. It’s now worth about
$1.84 after a decline in AMAG’s share price.  The suits were filed in Delaware Chancery Court. The deal
also has faced opposition from hedge fund MSMB Capital
Management, which owns 5.9 percent of AMAG, and said the company
may be overpaying for Allos.  Allos was unchanged yesterday at $1.45 in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares have fallen 30 percent since July 19,
the day before the merger was announced. AMAG, which makes the
anemia drug Feraheme, rose 3.2 percent to $14.39. The shares
have lost 25 percent since July 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
