Ex-KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoi, who
is wanted for the 2006 murder of dissident Russian agent
 Alexander Litvinenko  in  London , has demanded access to details
of the criminal case against him, Interfax reported.  Lawyers for Lugovoi, who attended preliminary hearings in
London into the murder as part of an inquiry ordered by a U.K.
coroner, have requested all the information from the
investigation, the news service cited Lugovoi as saying today.  The radiation-poisoning murder of Litvinenko, a Kremlin
critic and ex-KGB agent who fled  Russia  for the U.K., drove ties
between Russia and Britain to a post-Cold War low.  Russia refused to hand over Lugovoi because its
constitution forbids the extradition of citizens. The dispute
sparked a tit-for-tat expulsion of diplomats, while Russia
closed U.K. cultural offices outside Moscow. The Russian
Prosecutor Generalâ€™s Office declined comment when contacted
today by Bloomberg News. Lugovoi, now a lawmaker in the Russian
parliament, denies any role in the killing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
