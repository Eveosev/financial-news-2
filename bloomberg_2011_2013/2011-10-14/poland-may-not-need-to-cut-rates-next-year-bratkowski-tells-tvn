Poland may not need to cut interest
rates next year if the euro area avoids a worst-case scenario,
allowing the Polish economy to expand at better than a 3 percent
rate, Andrzej Bratkowski of the Monetary Policy Council said
late yesterday in an interview on TVN CNBC.  While a “very strong” slowdown that would slow Polish
economic growth to about 1 percent can’t be ruled out if there
is an uncontrolled Greek default, Bratkowski said it is “highly
unlikely.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
