The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds against non-payment increased,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index rose by 5 basis points to
198 basis points as of 8:47 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to
Credit Agricole SA prices. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40
investment-grade borrowers outside  Japan  climbed 4 basis points
to 214 basis points as of 11:47 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole
prices show. Both indexes are headed for the biggest daily
advance since Oct. 4, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index increased 5 basis points to
199 basis points as of 9:46 a.m. in Tokyo, Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The increase would be the largest since Oct. 5, CMA
data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default, and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporters on this story:
