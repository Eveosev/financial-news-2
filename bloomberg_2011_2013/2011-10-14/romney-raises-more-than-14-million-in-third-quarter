Jon Huntsman , the former Utah
governor and U.S. ambassador to  China , lent his campaign $2.2
million, half of the money he’s brought in for his Republican
presidential campaign, new  Federal Election Commission  reports
show.  His first disclosure report as a presidential candidate
shows Huntsman raised $2.2 million from donors through
September, and had $327,615 in the bank as of Sept. 30. He
reported spending $4.2 million and owing another $896,113.
Huntsman was not required to file a second quarter report in
July because he entered the primary race on June 14.  Huntsman’s report helps explain why he decided last month
to close his Florida headquarters and move the campaign
operation to less expensive  New Hampshire , a must-win for his
hopes of staying in the presidential contest.  Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney reported that he
raised $14.2 million from July to September.  Texas  Governor  Rick Perry  announced Oct. 5 that his campaign had raised more than
$17 million in the third quarter. Representative  Ron Paul  of
Texas said he had taken in more than $8 million.  Romney Cash  Romney had led all Republican contenders by raising $18.3
million from April to June. To date, he has taken in $33.6
million, all for the primary race, and had $14.7 million in the
bank as of Sept. 30, FEC filings show. He has spent $18 million,
including $12.3 million from July through September.  Romney reported $2 million in donations of $200 or less, 14
percent, more than double the 6 percent of small donations he
received during the second quarter, according to the  Campaign
Finance Institute , a Washington-based research group. The
campaign said it received money from 55,947 contributors in the
third quarter. Lobbyists raised $479,660 for him.  “This is just the start of the effort to help fuel Mitt
Romney’s message that will defeat President Obama next
November,” said Romney’s national finance chairman, Spencer Zwick, in an e-mailed statement.  In his unsuccessful 2008 presidential bid, Romney spent
$44.7 million of his own money on his campaign. He has yet to
make a loan to his candidacy this cycle.  Obama Fundraising  President  Barack Obama ’s campaign raised $42.1 million from
July through September, including $9 million from a joint
fundraising committee with the  Democratic National Committee ,
FEC filings show. He has raised $88 million for his re-election
and spent $29 million. Obama reported $61.4 million in the bank.  That is the second-most ever raised during a six month span
in a non-election year, trailing the $98 million that President
 George W. Bush  raised from July through December 2003. Unlike
Bush, Obama is raising money for the general election as well as
the primary.  Obama’s campaign released an updated list of bundlers,
those raising at least $50,000. He is the only candidate
identifying all of his major fundraisers, those who solicit
donations from friends and bundle the donations to the campaign.  Overall, Obama’s bundler ranks rose to 351, up from 244
fundraisers reported in the second quarter. The number of those
bringing in the biggest sums, more than $500,000, rose to 41
from 27 in June.  New additions include two veteran fundraisers who helped
raise more than $500,000 for Obama’s 2008 campaign --  Robert Wolf , chairman of UBS Americas, and Matthew Barzun, the 2012
campaign’s national finance chairman and former U.S. ambassador
to  Sweden . Kenneth Solomon, chief executive officer of the
Tennis Channel Inc., who brought in between $100,000 and
$200,000 in the last campaign, has also signed up for a second
fundraising stint.  Former Louisiana Governor Buddy Roemer, one of the long-
shots seeking the Republican nomination, reported that he raised
$127,521 and lent his campaign $10,000.  Tim Pawlenty , the former Minnesota governor who withdrew
from the Republican race in August, reported a campaign debt of
$453,842. He wound up raising $5.5 million for his campaign.  To contact the reporter on this story:
