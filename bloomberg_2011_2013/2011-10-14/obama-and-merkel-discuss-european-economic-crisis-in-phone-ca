President Barack Obama spoke with
German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  about the “evolving financial
situation in the eurozone,” White House press secretary  Jay Carney  said.  During the phone call today, the two “agreed to stay in
close contact” ahead of the Group of 20 nations summit next
month, Carney said in a statement.  European bank stocks have fallen as borrowing costs climbed
amid rising concern that the banks may have to take greater
losses on debt issued by Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and
Spain.  Obama will meet with other G-20 leaders Nov. 3-4 in France.  To contact the reporter on this story:
