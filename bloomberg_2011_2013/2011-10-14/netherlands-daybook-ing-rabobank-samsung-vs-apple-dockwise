Nations from  China  to  Brazil  are
considering increasing the International Monetary Fund’s lending
resources to help stem the European debt crisis, Group of 20 and
IMF officials said.  Policy makers are discussing an expansion of the IMF’s
firepower as part of a global G-20 agreement next month in
Cannes,  France , according to three officials, who declined to be
named because the discussions are not public. Talks are in
preliminary stages as potential contributors wait to see what
measures Europeans take to end the debt turmoil at an Oct. 23
summit, they said.  All times CET (ET+6)  WHAT TO WATCH:  *G-20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in Paris  *Fitch places Rabobank, 4 other major European commercial
