Germany and France disagree over a
reform of the Lisbon Treaty that would allow the European Union
to influence economic policies of debt-strapped countries, the
newspaper  Handelsblatt  reported, citing an unidentified EU
official.  While French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  favors an agreement
for the 17-nation euro area, German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  is
seeking a deal for all 27 EU states, the newspaper said. Germany
wants to include a passage into the declaration following an
Oct. 23 summit of leaders that would kick-start negotiations
about a treaty reform, Handelsblatt added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
