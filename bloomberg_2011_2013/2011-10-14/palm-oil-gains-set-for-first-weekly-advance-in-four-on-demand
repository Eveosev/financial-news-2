Palm oil  advanced to the highest
level in more than two weeks after soybeans gained on
speculation that  China  may boost imports to meet rising demand.  The December-delivery contract gained 2.2 percent to 2,906
ringgit ($929) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest level at close since Sept. 28. Futures
advanced 4.8 percent this week, the first in four weeks.  “Palm oil is taking cues from the gains in soybean because
of demand by end users in China,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at
Phillip Futures Pte., said by phone from  Singapore  today.
“China will be stepping up purchases due to positive crush
margins and strong demand from the livestock industry.”  China’s soybean imports rose 4 percent to a record 52.3
million tons in the year ended Sept. 30, according to customs
data. U.S. soybeans inspected for export more than doubled to
23.4 million bushels in the week ended Oct. 6 from a week
earlier, with two-thirds set for China, the Department of
Agriculture said this week.  Soybean futures for November delivery climbed as much as
0.7 percent to $12.66 a bushel, the highest level since Sept.
27, and traded at $12.65 on the Chicago Board of Trade.  India  Purchases  Palm oil futures may climb to 3,150 ringgit a ton in the
next two months, Ravi Chandra, vice president at Hyderabad,
India-based TransGraph Consulting Pvt., said yesterday. Palm oil
last traded above that level in July.  Refined, bleached, and deodorized palm oil imports by
India, the largest buyer, rose 54 percent to 143,296 tons in
September, while crude palm oil purchases declined 6.7 percent
to 548,904 tons, the  Solvent Extractors’ Association of India 
said today.  “The huge discount to soy will continue to attract buying
interest on any major falls,” Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a
director at Commtrendz Research Management Services Pvt. in
Mumbai, said in a report today.  Soybean oil’s premium over palm oil was $236.8 a ton today,
compared with an average of $166.31 this year. It touched
$289.96 a ton on Aug. 31, the highest since November 2008,
according to Bloomberg data.  Soybean oil  for December climbed as much as 1.2 percent to
53.09 cents per pound. Palm and soybean oils are substitutes in
food and fuel uses.  Palm oil for delivery in May climbed 0.5 percent to close
at 8,024 yuan ($1,258) per ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange 
and soybean oil for delivery in the same month advanced 0.6
percent to end at 9,376 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
