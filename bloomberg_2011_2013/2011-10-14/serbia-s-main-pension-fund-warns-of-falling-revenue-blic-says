The dominant Serbian state-run
 pension fund ’s revenue fell below 54 percent of what it needs to
make monthly payments to more than 1.6 million retirees who rely
on it,  Blic  newspaper reported, citing a managing board member.  The shortfall of more than 46 percent, covered by  Serbia ’s
central budget, will continue to increase as many employers fail
to pay the mandatory contributions to the fund, the report said
quoting Slavenko Grgurevic.  The fund asked the government to restructure it and to
improve tax discipline because the pay-as-you-go system is
becoming unsustainable, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
