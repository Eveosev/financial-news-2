A measure of how much European banks
pay to fund in dollars declined to the lowest in four weeks as
Group of 20 finance ministers began discussions on the debt
crisis.  The one-year cross-currency basis swap, the rate banks pay
to convert euro payments into dollars, was 64 basis points below
the euro interbank offered rate as of 12:50 p.m. in  London , from
66 yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s
the smallest gap since Sept. 15.  European officials are outlining a rescue plan that may
include deeper investor losses on Greek bonds, higher bank
capital levels and increased firepower for bailouts and the
 International Monetary Fund . The elements of the European rescue
plan emerged as finance ministers and central bankers from the
G-20 meet in Paris.  “It’s encouraging that European leaders are starting to
understand the need for much aggressive action,” Colin Tan, a
credit analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Sydney, wrote in a note.
“But markets will want to see more details as we start to get
closer to the big announcement.”  The three-month cross-currency basis swap was 88.5 basis
points under Euribor from minus 91 yesterday. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  A measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another in
 Europe  was little changed. The Euribor-OIS spread, the
difference between the borrowing benchmark and overnight index
swaps was 74 basis points. The rate reached 89 basis points on
Sept. 23, the widest since March 2009.  ECB Deposits  Overnight deposits at the  European Central Bank  rose. Banks
parked 123 billion euros ($170 billion) at the Frankfurt-based
ECB yesterday, up from 105 billion euros on Oct. 12. That
compares with a year-to-date average of 59 billion euros.  Three-month Euribor -- the rate banks say they pay for
three-month loans in euros -- rose to 1.574 percent from 1.572
percent yesterday. One-week Euribor fell to 1.174 percent from
1.181 percent.  The three-month dollar London interbank offered rate, or
Libor, rose for a 26th day to 0.405 percent from 0.403 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. That’s the
highest since Aug. 6, 2010.  The TED spread, or the difference between what lenders and
the U.S. government pay to borrow for three months, rose one
basis point to 39 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
