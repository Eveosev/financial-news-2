Following is a table showing advance
estimates of  Singapore ’s third quarter GDP, as well as prior GDP
growth rates released by the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  Note: * Latest quarterly figures are preliminary. The advance estimates  for third quarter 2011 GDP were computed largely from the first two  months’ data (ie. July and August 2011), as well as data (where  available) and estimates for September. They are intended as an early  indication of GDP growth in the quarter, and will be revised when  comprehensive data are available.
