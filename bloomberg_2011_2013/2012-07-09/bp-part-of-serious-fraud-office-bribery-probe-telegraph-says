BP Plc (BP/)  is part of a U.K. Serious
Fraud Office investigation over bribery allegations relating to
one of its engineering contractors in  Azerbaijan , the  Daily
Telegraph  reported, without saying where it obtained the
information.  The contractor, whose identity is not known, reported the
allegations itself to the SFO last year; while there are no
suggestions that BP employees paid bribes, the company may still
be held liable if the contractor is found guilty under the
Bribery Act, and if wrongdoing took place after July 1, 2011,
the newspaper said.  BP is currently developing one of the world’s largest gas
pipelines in Azerbaijan, known as the Shah Deniz project. BP and
the SFO wouldn’t comment on the bribery allegations, the
Telegraph reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
