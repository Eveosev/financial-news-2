Mexico had its short-term foreign
currency rating raised one notch to A-2 from A-3 at  Standard &
Poor’s  as the company cited a change in critera.  S&P affirmed Mexico’s BBB long-term rating, the second-
lowest investment grade mark. The outlook is stable, the ratings
company said today in a statement.  The move “results from the revision of Standard & Poor’s
criteria on the linkage between long-term and short-term ratings
for sovereigns,” the company said in the statement. “The
change in the short-term foreign currency rating on Mexico does
not reflect an improvement in the sovereign’s short-term
creditworthiness.”  S&P said Mexico’s net debt is likely to hold at about 35
percent of gross domestic product, while economic growth will
average 3.3 percent in the “following several years,” the
statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
