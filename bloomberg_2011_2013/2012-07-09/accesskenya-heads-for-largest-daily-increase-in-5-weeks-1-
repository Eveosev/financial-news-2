AccessKenya Group Ltd. (ACCESS) , the East
African nation’s only publicly traded Internet company, climbed
the most in a month as investors speculated first-half earnings
will increase.  The stock climbed as much as 7.4 percent, the most since
June 5, to 5.10 shillings and traded at 5 shillings as of 1:36
p.m. in Nairobi.  The company expects higher first-half earnings after it
increased the number of corporate customers this year to 5,000,
Managing Director Jonathan Somen said June 12. The company had
4,700 at the end of 2011, according to its annual report. Net
income in the 12 months to December 2011 was 109 million
shillings ($1.3 million) compared with a loss of 8 million
shillings a year earlier.  “Much as the company returned to profit last year they
were still struggling and we should expect more recovery this
year even though it will not be exceptional,” Eric Musau, a
research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd.
said in a phone interview today.  AccessKenya plans to add 50 buildings to its fiber-optic
network and lengthen the link by 50 kilometres (31 miles) in the
second half of this year, Somen said June 28.  Shares in Nairobi-based AccessKenya plunged 62 percent last
year. The company has gained 1.9 percent this year,
underperforming the benchmark  NSE All Share Index (NSEASI) , which has
advanced 26 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
