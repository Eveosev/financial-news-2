Merck KGaA (MRK) ’s future research and
development investments in  Portugal  are at risk because of
unpaid hospital bills, Gangolf Schrimpf, a spokesman for the
Darmstadt, Germany-based chemicals and drugmaker, said today,
confirming a report in  Financial Times Deutschland .  The pharmaceutical industry has more than 1.5 billion euros
($1.8 billion) of open bills at Portuguese public hospitals, the
newspaper reported, citing Fritz Sacher, the company’s managing
director in the country. Schrimpf declined to comment on how
much the company is owed.  Future investments at risk could be in the double-digit
million-euro range, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
