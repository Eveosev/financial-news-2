Peru ’s sol climbed to a three-week
high after companies bought the currency to pay local taxes and
worker bonuses.  The sol advanced 0.4 percent to 2.6385 per  U.S. dollar 
today, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. That’s the
currency’s strongest closing level since June 19.  “It’s the delayed effect of increased dollar sales by
companies last week for the payment of taxes and bonuses,” said
Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco Internacional del Peru in  Lima .
The dollar supply boosted local banks’ dollar holdings while
demand from foreign investors has died down, he said.  Local commercial banks’ net dollar positions totaled $441
million on July 5, compared with $318 million a day earlier,
according to central bank data compiled by Bloomberg.  The central bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot
market  today.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 4.95 percent, according to prices compiled
by Bloomberg. The bond’s price fell 0.28 centimo to 118.99
centimos per sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
