Bahrain government may ask new
telecom companies to bid for high-speed next-generation
telecommunications networks, Alwasat newspapers reported, citing
a government plan.  The government will ask new firms to bid if the number of
the current licensed companies in the kingdom isnâ€™t enough to
provide long-term evolution, or fourth generation services, the
Bahraini daily  said , citing the plan that was issued on July 5.
The  Telecommunications Regulatory Authority  will seek bids for
the 4G network at the end of this year, the newspaper said.  The government may also directly intervene in the market
to provide high-speed broadband services if current providers
are unable to add more subscribers to high-speed broadband
networks, according to the newspaper. The government is aware
that current prices charged to customers are low and not helping
companies to invest further to upgrade the high-speed broadband
network, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
