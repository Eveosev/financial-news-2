Boeing Co.  is set to win an order
this week from  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL)  for 100 of the
planemaker’s 737 jets in a transaction that may be valued at
about $8.4 billion, people familiar with the matter said.  The accord includes options for as many as 100 more jets
and will be announced July 12 in  Chicago , where both companies
are based, said two of the people, who asked not to be
identified because details aren’t public. The order will include
the upgraded 737 Max model, the people said.  A deal later this week would be a boost for Boeing as it
promotes the Max at the Farnborough International Air Show
outside  London . The company wasn’t offering the jet at the June
2011 expo in Paris, where Airbus SAS routed Boeing with sales
and commitments for its revamped single-aisle A320neo.  “It’s one of many positives for Boeing,” said  Ray Neidl ,
a Maxim Group LLC analyst who covers Boeing and United. “We all
knew for a long time the airlines were starving for a more fuel-
efficient narrowbody. Now that one’s available in the next few
years, airlines are falling over themselves to get them.”  Boeing opened the air show today by announcing a $7.2
billion order for 75 single-aisle 737 Max aircraft from  Air
Lease Corp. (AL) , the first such purchase by a lessor.  General
Electric Co. (GE) ’s jet-leasing unit also is poised to purchase 100
737s, people familiar with that transaction said.  Exclusive Supplier  United’s mix of Max jets and current 737s will determine
the list value of its order. The 737-8, the top-selling existing
model, retails for $84.4 million, and the Max 8, the equivalent
new plane, is $95.5 million, according to Boeing’s website.  The order is United’s first since the 2010 merger creating
the carrier from former United parent UAL Corp. and Continental
Airlines Inc. Boeing was Continental’s exclusive plane supplier
for two decades, and the accord deepens ties between the world’s
largest airline and the biggest aerospace company.  United declined to comment, said Christen David, a
spokeswoman. A Boeing spokesman, Tim Bader, said the company had
no comment.  Boeing rose 0.5 percent to $74.03 at the close in  New York .
United fell 1.4 percent to $23.90, declining along with most
carriers in the  Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index. (BUSAIRL)   United held talks over about six months on a possible mixed
order of current and new-model 737s and A320s before opting to
stay with Boeing, people familiar with those discussions said in
April.  Planemaker Competition  The U.S. planemaker is trying to reclaim the top spot in
commercial production lost to Airbus in 2003. Toulouse, France-
based Airbus had record orders of 1,419 aircraft in 2011, while
Boeing’s tally was 805. Airbus won 95 percent of narrow-body
sales at the Paris show, and has said 2012 orders may fall by
half as an initial flurry of A320neo purchases wanes.  United’s order will make it the last of the four biggest
U.S. carriers to announce single-aisle jet purchases in less
than a year.  Delta Air Lines Inc. agreed in August to acquire 100 737s,
a month after AMR Corp.’s  American Airlines  split a record order
for 460 jets between Boeing and Airbus. Southwest Airlines Co.
agreed in December to buy 208 737s in an order that was the
first for the Max.  Boeings make up about 78 percent of United’s mainline jets,
with the rest made by Airbus. The 555-plane regional fleet is
split about evenly between  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B)  and  Embraer SA. (EMBR3)   United Fleet  Narrow-body jets made up 78 percent, or 545 planes, of
United’s 701 mainline planes, according to its latest annual
report. Boeing 757-200s are the oldest of United’s single-aisle
jets, with an average age of 18.2 years, followed by 737-500s
that average 16.6 years old. Both models are out of production.  Separately, United said today it plans a special livery for
the Boeing 787  Dreamliners  it will begin receiving in September,
with a gold line running along the fuselage. United, the first
North American carrier to receive the composite-plastic plane,
expects to start flying five of the jets this year.  The airline has firm orders for 50 Dreamliners with
deliveries through 2019.  To contact the reporters on this story:
