European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said central banks need a “sense
of proportion” on rate decisions and it is wise for them not to
use all their firepower at once.  “It is the right thing for a central bank to act with a
sense of proportion and calm,” Nowotny, who heads  Austria ’s
central bank, told journalists in Vienna today. “You shouldn’t
use all your firepower at once,” he said, adding that it was
ECB policy to “never pre-commit” on rates.  The Frankfurt-based ECB last week cut its main  interest
rates  by 25 basis points, taking the  benchmark  to a new record
low of 0.75 percent and the deposit rate to zero. Some
economists say the ECB will be forced to do more as  Europe ’s
sovereign debt crisis threatens to tip the economy into
recession. Policy makers next decide on rates on Aug. 2.  Nowotny said he doesn’t think taking the deposit rate into
negative territory would have much impact. That would mean banks
have to pay the ECB to park money with it overnight.  “We have lowered the deposit rate, it is now at zero,”
Nowotny said. “A further lowering in my view would not have
much more effect.”  By cutting the benchmark rate, the ECB has lowered the cost
of its loans for banks, and “that should give a certain
economic impulse,” Nowotny said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
