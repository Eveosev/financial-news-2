Portuguese doctors will hold a two-
day strike this week to protest against government measures for
the sector, television channel SIC Noticias reported today,
citing representatives from the Independent Doctors’ Union and
the National Federation of Doctors.  The July 11-12 strike will take place after both unions
sent a joint-statement to the government with a list of 20
complaints, which included calls to terminate the government’s
new recruitment program for the country’s  National Health
Service , according to SIC Noticias.  To contact the reporter on this story:
