Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending  rate , opened at 0.17 percent, within the Federal
Reserve’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.1 percent on July 6 after trading
from 0.1 percent to 0.21 percent and averaging 0.17 percent,
ICAP Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire $1.5 billion to $2 billion of
Treasuries maturing from February 2036 to May 2042. The
purchases are the part of the Fed’s program, which lasts through
the end of the year, to replace $267 billion of short-term debt
in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries in an effort to
reduce borrowing costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
