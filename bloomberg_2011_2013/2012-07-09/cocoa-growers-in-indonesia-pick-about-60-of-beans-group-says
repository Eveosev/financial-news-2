Cocoa farmers in  Indonesia , the
world’s third-largest producer, harvested about 60 percent of
this year’s estimated crop of 500,000 metric tons, according to
the Indonesian Cocoa Association.  The harvest will be completed by September or October this
year after flowering was delayed by rains in some areas, Dakhri Sanusi, accociation’s secretary general, said in a phone
interview from Makassar, South Sulawesi. Farmers finish picking
most beans typically by July every year, he said. Rising
domestic demand may cut exports as the Southeast Asian producer
has installed grinding capacity of about 600,000 tons, he said.  Futures have risen 6.8 percent in  New York  this year,
increasing cost at  Hershey Co. (HSY)  and  Barry Callebaut AG (BARN) , the
largest market of bulk chocolate. Indonesia’s cocoa output may
climb 15 percent to 20 percent in 2013 after growers boosted
planting, John Bako Baon, a senior research scientist at the
Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute, said June 13.  Exports from Central and South Sulawesi provinces dropped
52 percent in the first half to 31,173 tons, the association
said July 3. Sulawesi island, the country’s main growing region,
represents about 75 percent of bean exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
