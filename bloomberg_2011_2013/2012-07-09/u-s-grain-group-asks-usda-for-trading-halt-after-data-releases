The National Grain and Feed
Association, the largest U.S. grain-trading group, urged the
Department of Agriculture for a one-hour trading halt for U.S.
futures and options during the release of supply and demand
reports.  The USDA has a “clear interest in helping create an
environment in which its major statistical reports do not roil
markets to the extent that producers and agribusiness firms
reliant upon them are disadvantaged or competitively harmed,”
the association said in response to the department’s notice
requesting comments on the public release times of major
agriculture reports, according to an e-mailed statement today.  The group submitted the comments “while acknowledging that
implementing and enforcing such a pause is probably beyond the
control of USDA,” according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
