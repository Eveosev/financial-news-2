Greece’s economy will contract by
more than forecast this year as rising unemployment and wage and
pension cuts curb domestic demand, the Foundation for Economic
and Industrial Research said.  The economy will shrink by about 6.9 percent in 2012, the
same as in in 2011, and more than its April 2 forecast for a 5
percent contraction, the Athens-based foundation, also known as
 IOBE , said today in its quarterly  report  on the  Greek economy .  The high rate of decline in consumer demand since the
beginning of the year will continue to have a negative impact on
the labor market with unemployment for 2012 expected to reach
23.6 percent, according to IOBE. The foundation was headed by
Yannis Stournaras until he was named Finance Minister on June
26.  Unemployment in Greece soared to a record 22.6 percent in
the first quarter amid a slump deepened by wage and pension cuts
and tax increases that are part of austerity measures linked to
the country’s international rescue program. Gross domestic
product in Greece, which is in its fifth year of recession,
shrank 6.5 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.  Greece  will tell its creditors that high unemployment and
recession necessitate changes to the country’s international
bailout agreement, government spokesman Simeon Kedikoglou said
