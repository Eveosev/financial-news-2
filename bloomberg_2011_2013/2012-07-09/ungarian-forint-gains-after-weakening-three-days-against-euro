The forint gained for the first time
in four days against the euro, rebounding from the biggest
decline in more than a week after  Hungary ’s  trade surplus  beat
economists’ estimates.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to 288.71 per
euro by 10:32 a.m. in Budapest after losing 1.1 percent on July
6. Yields on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds were
little changed at 7.984 percent.  The trade surplus was 701 million euros ($860 million) in
May, the statistics office in Budapest said today based on
preliminary data. Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast a
surplus of 600 million euros. The forint fell last week after
the central bank said a new tax on financial transactions
proposed by the government may violate European Union rules.  “The better-than-expected  trade balance  may have played a
role in the forint’s rebound,” Peter Karsai, a Budapest-based
trader at Commerzbank AG, wrote in an e-mail today.  The first round of talks between Hungary, the  International
Monetary Fund  and the EU on a  credit line  will take place
between July 17-25, Mihaly Varga, minister in charge of the
talks, said in an interview on public television station M1
today. The EU’s executive arm announced the start of talks on
July 6 after Hungarian legislators approved amendments to a
disputed central bank law which has blocked negotiations for
more than seven months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
