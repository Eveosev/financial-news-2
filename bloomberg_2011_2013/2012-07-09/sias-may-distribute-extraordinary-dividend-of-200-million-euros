Societa Iniziative Autostradali e
Servizi SpA (SIS) , Italy’s second-biggest highway manager by market
value, will probably distribute an extraordinary dividend of
about 200 million euros ($246 million), Beniamino Gavio said.  SIAS may distribute the dividend in September, Gavio,
chairman of the Gavio family’s Argo Finanziaria, said in an
interview in Milan on July 5. The company, which manages
highways in northwestern Italy, said May 11 it may distribute a
special dividend with the proceeds of the sale of Chilean
assets.  The Gavio family controls  Autostrada Torino-Milano SpA (AT) ,
which is SIAS’s largest shareholder. ASTM owns a stake of just
less than 30 percent in  Impregilo (IPG)  SpA, Italy’s largest
construction company, and is fighting to keep control of the
board as rival investor Salini SpA called a shareholder meeting
for July 12 to revoke directors.  SIAS said in a March 20 presentation that the 565 million-
euro proceeds from the sale of Chilean assets could also be used
to buy out minorities of existing concessionaires or exercise a
 call option  for Autostrada Torino-Savona, which expires at the
end of September. Impregilo may propose an extraordinary
dividend of at least 100 million euros if the Gavio family
retains control of the board, Gavio said in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
