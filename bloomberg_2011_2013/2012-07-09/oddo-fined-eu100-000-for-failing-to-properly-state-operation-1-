Oddo & Cie., a Paris brokerage, was
fined 100,000 euros ($123,000) today by  France ’s financial
markets regulator for failing to properly state some
operations between 2009 and 2011.  Oddo didn’t profit or otherwise benefit from its failures
to file the reports and fixed the situation when it came to
light, the Autorite des Marches Financiers said in a  statement 
on its website. The declarations help the regulator monitor for
market abuse, making it important for brokers to report them.  The AMF recognized that the mistake was “made in good
faith, which excluded any willful deceit,” according to an e-
mailed statement from Oddo lawyer Martin Tomasi. The regulator
“didn’t impose any disciplinary sanction, just a simple fine.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
