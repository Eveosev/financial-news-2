OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil
producer, halted a crude distillation unit at its Tuapse
refinery on the  Black Sea  for unplanned repairs, data from the
Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit show.  The AT-1 unit was halted on July 1 and is scheduled to
resume operations on July 11, according to data received by e-
mail today. The unit can process 46,000 barrels a day, previous
CDU-TEK data show.  Rosneft started the AVT-8 crude distillation unit at its
Novokuibyshevsk refinery on July 4 after almost a month of
planned maintenance, CDU-TEK said. AVT-8 has a capacity of
34,000 barrels a day, according to CDU-TEK.  To contact the reporter on this story:
