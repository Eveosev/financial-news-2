European investor confidence dropped
to a three-year low in July as the sovereign debt crisis
threatens to tip the euro region into recession.  Germany ’s Sentix research institute said its index
measuring  sentiment  in the euro-area economy fell to minus 29.6
from minus 28.9 in June. That’s the lowest since July 2009.
Economists forecast an increase to minus 26.6, the median of
nine estimates in a Bloomberg News survey shows. A gauge of
expectations slid to minus 24 from minus 22.5, while a measure
of current conditions held at minus 35.  Sentix said 865 investors participated in the survey, which
was conducted between July 5 and July 7. The results are never
revised.
