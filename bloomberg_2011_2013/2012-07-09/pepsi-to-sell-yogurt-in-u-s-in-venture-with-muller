PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , the world’s largest
snack food maker, and Theo Muller Group will begin selling
premium yogurt products in the U.S. through a joint venture
starting this month.  Muller Quaker Dairy, the partnership between Theo Muller,
the largest-closely held dairy business in Germany, and
Purchase, New York-based PepsiCo, will sell yogurt through
supermarkets and club retailers in the Northeast and mid-
Atlantic states, according to a statement today.  Chief Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi  is working to turn
PepsiCo into a global dairy player. The company, which sells
Quaker Oats as well as its namesake soda, formed the Global
Nutrition Group in 2010 to develop more products with fruits,
vegetables, grains and dairy.  While PepsiCo sells yogurt and milk in Russia and the
 Middle East , it doesn’t sell dairy products in the U.S., where
it generated more than half of its $66.5 billion revenue last
year.  “As we’ve seen through the success of our dairy business
in other parts of the world, this is a category with strong
growth prospects,” Mehmood Khan, Pepsi’s chief scientific
officer, global research and development, said in the statement.  This month, the companies will begin selling a range of
yogurt products such as Muller Corner and Muller Greek Corner in
17 U.S. markets.  PepsiCo fell 0.3 percent to $69.99 at the close in  New
York . Muller, based in  Luxembourg , orginates from Bavaria,
Germany.  To contact the reporter on this story:
