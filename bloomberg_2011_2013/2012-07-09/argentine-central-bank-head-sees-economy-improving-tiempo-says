Mercedes Marco del Pont forecasts economic growth will improve
in the second half of this year after the global slowdown
affected her nation’s expansion in the second quarter, newspaper

benefit from a recovery in neighboring  Brazil , global demand for
its soybean exports and increased internal demand, the del Pont
said, according to the Buenos Aires-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
