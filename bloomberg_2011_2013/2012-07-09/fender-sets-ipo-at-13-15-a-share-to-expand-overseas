Fender Musical Instruments Corp. (FNDR) , the
largest seller of guitars in the U.S., filed to raise as much as
$160.7 million in an initial public offering to repay debt.  The company and its stockholders are offering 10.7 million
shares at $13 to $15 each, according to a regulatory  filing 
today. Fender, based in Scottsdale,  Arizona , estimates net
proceeds of about $88.2 million and didn’t disclose a date for
the IPO.  Fender, which makes electric guitars based on musicians
such as Eric Clapton and  Jimi Hendrix , joins Kayak Software
Corp. and Palo Alto Networks Inc. in setting price ranges for
U.S. IPOs today as companies and investors regain risk appetite
after a month-long drought following  Facebook Inc .’s May 17
initial offering.  The midpoint of the offering range would value Fender at
$369 million, or about 0.5 times sales of $704 million in the 12
months through April 1 and 26 times net income of $13.9 million
in the same period, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Fender is offering about 7.1 million shares in the sale,
while Weston Presidio Capital, the largest existing shareholder,
plans to sell about 3.6 million shares, the filing shows.
Weston, which currenly owns 43 percent of Fender’s stock, will
trim its stake to 18 percent in the IPO.  Revenue at Fender rose 2.2 percent to $173.8 million in the
first quarter ended April 1 and advanced 13 percent to $700.6
million last year. Fender’s net income was $19 million last year
compared to a net loss of $1.7 million in 2010.  Emerging Markets  The company sees opportunity to grow sales by gaining more
of the global market for musical instruments and accessories,
which totaled $15.8 billion -- with $6.4 billion coming from the
U.S -- in 2010, according to the filing.  Fender, which makes the popular Stratocaster, sees growth
coming from  emerging markets  such as China and  India  as guitar-
based music becomes more popular in those nations.  The company gets 47 percent of its sales from outside the
U.S. and sells products in 85 countries. Many of its models,
including an  Eric Clapton  Stratocaster, sell for more than
$2,000. Clapton is a three-time inductee into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame.  Founder Leo Fender sold the company to Columbia Records
Distribution Corp., a division of Columbia Broadcasting System,
Inc., in 1965, according to the filing. The late William Schultz
and current board member William Mendello then purchased Fender
in 1985 from  CBS Corp. (CBS)   Larry Thomas, 62, has been chief executive officer since
August 2010 when he ended a 6-year retirement following a career
at retailer Guitar Center Inc. that included eight years as CEO.  The shares will be listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market under
the ticker FNDR.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  and William Blair & Co.
will lead the IPO.  To contact the reporters on this story:
