Arcadia Group Ltd.’s Topshop and
Topman fashion chains will open their first pop-up shop in
Africa on July 12 to test consumer appetite for the U.K.
clothing brands.  The store-within-a-store will open at Cape Town’s Unknown
Union retail outlet and operate until the end of October, Sean
Shuter, director of Unknown Union, said by phone from the South
African city.  Growth in South Africa’s middle class has encouraged luxury
clothing brands from abroad, such as  Burberry Group Plc (BRBY) , to add
stores in the country since last year. The South African
expansion by Arcadia, which is controlled by British billionaire
 Philip Green , contrasts with the company’s plans to scale back
in the U.K.  “I knew Topshop and Topman had  brand recognition  locally,
but now it seems bigger than I’d thought,” Shuter said. “For a
pop-up store, this is a fairly long run.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
