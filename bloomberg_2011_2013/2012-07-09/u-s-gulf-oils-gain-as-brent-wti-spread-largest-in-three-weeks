U.S. Gulf Coast crude premiums gained
versus West Texas Intermediate as the benchmark’s discount to
 Brent crude  widened to the largest margin in more than three
weeks.  The gap between WTI and Brent increased 59 cents to $14.33
a barrel in  New York , based on settlement prices. When Brent
rises versus WTI, it typically boosts the value of U.S. grades
that compete foreign oils priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 25 cents to
$13.50 a barrel at 12:29 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet gained 35 cents to
$13.25 a barrel over WTI.  Poseidon’s premium increased 30 cents to $8.60 a barrel,
while Southern Green Canyon was unchanged at $7.60 over. Mars
Blend added 30 cents to $9.60 a barrel over WTI.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 75 cents to
an $12-a-barrel premium.  Western Canada Select’s discount to WTI narrowed $3.75 to
$22.50 a barrel. Syncrude’s discount narrowed 40 cents to $2.60.
Syncrude is a synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in
 Alberta  into refinery-ready crude.  Bakken oil’s discount narrowed $2 to $7 below the U.S.
benchmark.  To contact the reporter on this story:
