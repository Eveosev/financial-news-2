Iran  sees no need for OPEC to hold an
emergency meeting if the current trend of rising crude prices
continues, Shana reported, citing the nation’s oil minister.  The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed at
their meeting last month that “if  oil prices  fall below $100 a
barrel it means that prices are in crisis,” Rostam Qasemi said.
“OPEC members agreed to comply with the current production
ceiling of 30 million barrels a day.”  The group also agreed that they would hold an emergency
meeting if prices fell “irrationally,” he said, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
