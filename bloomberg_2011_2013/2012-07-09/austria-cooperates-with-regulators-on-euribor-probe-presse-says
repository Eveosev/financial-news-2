Austria ’s Financial Markets Authority
is cooperating with other European regulators to examine whether
European lenders manipulated of the Euro Interbank Offered Rate,
or Euribor, Die Presse reported, citing FMA spokesman Klaus Grubelnik.  While there are “no indications” of a manipulation, the
regulators will look at this “very closely,” Grubelnik was
cited as saying.  The probe, which has yet to start in Austria and was kicked
off because of  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s admitted rigging the London
interbank offered rate, or Libor, as well as the Euribor, its
equivalent in euros, will be of 43 European lenders including
 Erste Group Bank AG (EBS)  and  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI) , who
both deny any wrongdoing, the Vienna-based paper said.  Erste always acted in line with requirements and denies any
wrongdoing, spokeswoman Hana Cygonkova said by phone from
Vienna. Raiffeisen “of course didn’t collude with others” in
making entries into the Euribor system, Raiffeisen Zentralbank
Oesterreich AG spokesman Andreas Ecker-Nakamura said by e-mail,
rejecting any wrongdoing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
