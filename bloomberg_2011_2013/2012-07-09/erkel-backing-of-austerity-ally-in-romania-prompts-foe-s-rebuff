German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
intervened in a Romanian power struggle, backing President
Traian Basescu against efforts by Prime Minister Victor Ponta to
impeach him over budget-austerity measures.  Merkel spoke by telephone today to Basescu after the
country’s parliament, dominated by Ponta’s party, voted on July
6 to suspend the president for exceeding his mandate with
measures including budget cuts in 2010 and set a July 29
referendum on his removal from office.  “The chancellor views it as unacceptable that basic
principles of the rule of law are violated in a European Union
country,” the German government press office said in a
statement announcing the phone call. Romania, like all EU
governments, must abide by common values, according to the
statement.  Romania’s governing  Social Democrats  and Liberals have
eased the impeachment process, lowered the bar for winning a
referendum and limited the  Constitutional Court ’s power to keep
it from impeding suspension. Basescu’s Democrat-Liberal Party
has challenged the changes in the high court. The political
turmoil pushed the leu to a record low.  “I don’t think Mrs. Merkel will be the one voting in
Romania in the referendum,” Ponta told reporters in Bucharest
today. Merkel and her party back Basescu “because they are the
only supporters of austerity in Europe,” he said.  “I don’t think anyone can challenge the right of the
Romanian people to say their opinion about the president,”
Ponta said. “There have been changes in  France , in Spain. This
is democracy.”  Basescu’s party cut state wages by 25 percent and raised
taxes to narrow a  budget deficit  and meet pledges to the
 International Monetary Fund  and the EU.  Envoys of the IMF, the EU and the  World Bank  are due in
Romania this month to review its progress under a 5 billion-euro
($6.2 billion) accord secured last year to shield the country
from the euro area’s sovereign-debt crisis. Romania is not a
member of the currency union.  To contact the reporters on this story:
