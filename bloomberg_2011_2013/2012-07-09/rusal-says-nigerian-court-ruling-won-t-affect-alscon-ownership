United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest
aluminum producer, said it expects to keep its 77.5 percent
stake in a Nigerian unit even after the country’s highest court
nullified the acquisition last week.  “According to our information, last Friday’s ruling of
 Nigeria ’s Supreme Court neither changes, nor can change, the
owner of Alscon,” Moscow-based Rusal said today in an e-mailed
statement, referring to the Aluminum Smelter Co. of Nigeria.  Justice Olushola Fabiyi said July 6 that the court ruled
against Rusal because the Russian company didn’t win the bidding
for Alscon legally. The court ruled that another company,
Bancorp Financial Investment Group, had “a valid contract” to
acquire Alscon before Rusal took it over.  Bancorp Financial’s contract to acquire Alscon was
terminated by Nigeria’s Bureau of Public Enterprises. That means
the Nigerian government must “bear responsibility” for the
 Supreme Court ’s ruling, Rusal said. “It cannot have an effect
on Rusal’s ownership,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
