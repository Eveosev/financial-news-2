 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will
sign a $1 billion four-year  term loan  with about seven banks on
a club basis to fund a buyback of a stake of about 20 percent
from  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , a person familiar with the matter said.  China Development Bank Corp. is also providing a $1 billion
four-year loan separately to help the country’s biggest e-
commerce company repurchase the stake, the person said.  Of the original underwriters and lead arrangers on a $3
billion syndicated facility signed by the company earlier this
year, HSBC Holdings Plc is not joining the new club, according
to the person. The original members were  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) , Credit Suisse Group AG, DBS Bank Ltd.,
Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC, and Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Alibaba’s revenue exceeded $1.8 billion in the first half,
increasing more than 60 percent from the same period last year,
the person said. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization accounted for more than 40 percent of revenue in
the first six months compared with 35 percent in the same period
last year, according to the person.  The company signed a $3 billion facility, comprising $2
billion in a bridge loan and $1 billion in a three-year term
loan, in February, the person said. The $2 billion bridge
portion was replaced by a $1 billion three-year loan from CDB
completed last month and the new $1 billion four-year loan from
CDB, according to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
