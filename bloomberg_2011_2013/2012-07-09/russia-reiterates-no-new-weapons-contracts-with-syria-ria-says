Russia reiterated it won’t sign new
weapons contracts with  Syria  until the situation stabilizes in
the conflict-ridden Middle Eastern state, RIA Novosti reported,
citing a senior Russian arms-export official.  Russia is fulfilling existing arms deals with Syria,
including repairing military equipment, the deputy head of the
Federal Service for Military-Technical Cooperation, Vyacheslav
Dzirkaln, was cited as saying at the Farnborough Air Show in
southern  England .  Russian Foreign Minister  Sergei Lavrov  said June 9 that his
country would only send weapons to Syria under previously signed
contracts. Any military hardware delivered to Syria couldn’t be
used against peaceful demonstrators, he said.  Since 2006 Syria signed with Russia arms contracts for
about $5.5 billion, according to CAST estimates. In 2012, Syria
is due to receive Russian weapons for about $500 million, CAST
estimates.  Russia has contracts with Syria to deliver fighter jets,
anti-aircraft systems and anti-tank systems, according to
Pukhov’s think tank. Vyacheslav Davidenko, a spokesman for
Rosoboronexport, Russia’s arms export monopoly, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
