Billionaire casino executive  Sheldon Adelson , who has donated tens of millions of dollars to promote
Republican presidential candidates and oppose President  Barack Obama , is also using his wealth to elect Republicans in Florida.  Adelson donated $1 million last month to a super-political
action committee that promotes Representative  Connie Mack  IV,
who polls show is favored to win the state’s Aug. 14 Republican
Senate primary and oppose Democratic incumbent  Bill Nelson  in
November.  The contribution was disclosed today in a filing by the
super-PAC, Freedom PAC, to the Federal Election Commission
today.  Freedom PAC is “supporting strong conservative candidates
in Florida,” and its “top priority is electing Connie Mack to
the U.S. Senate,” the PAC says on its  website .  Adelson and his wife Miriam donated $10 million in June to
a super-PAC that backs Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Adelson and his family members previously had
contributed $21.5 million to a super-PAC supporting  Newt Gingrich , one of Romney’s rivals for the Republican nomination.  Freedom PAC received $50,000 in May from Florida-based The
Villages of Lake Sumter, one of the world’s largest retirement
communities. Billionaire H. Gary Morse is the development’s
chief executive officer.  Harold Simmons, the billionaire chairman of Dallas-based
Contran Corp., gave $5,000 last month to Freedom PAC. Simmons
and his wife have given more than $15 million to super-PACs as
individuals or through his company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
