Farm officials from Krasnodar,
 Russia ’s largest grain-growing region, are visiting fields to
assess crop damage from floods that killed 171 people over the
weekend.  Ministry specialists will estimate possible damage to crops
after field visits, Yekaterina Melnik, a spokeswoman for the
regional ministry in Krasnodar, said by phone today. The region
harvested 11.4 million metric tons of grains last year, or 12
percent of the national crop, government statistics show.  OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port (NMTP)  resumed operations
after halting activities for about four hours on July 7. The
Black Sea port is drying equipment that was flooded and will be
ready to load a ship with grains later this week, Mikhail
Sidorov, the port’s deputy director general, said by phone from
Novorossiysk.  Grain transportation to the port was disrupted after rains
damaged the rail connection with the flooded town of Krymsk, he
said. After carrying out repairs, OAO Russian Railways halted
freight traffic temporarily to give priority to passenger
trains, according to Sidorov. The port will use grain from its
silo to load ships for now, he said.  Russian Railways closed transportation to Novorossiysk
because of a flood-damaged bridge and began to move grain cars
to Tuapse instead, Dmitry Pertsev, a spokesman for the state
railway monopoly, said by phone from Moscow. Bridge repairs are
expected to be finished later today and transportation will be
restored with passenger trains given priority, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
