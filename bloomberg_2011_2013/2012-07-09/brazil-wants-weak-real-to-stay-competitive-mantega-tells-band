Brazil’s government plans to
“maintain a devalued real” using various mechanisms to anchor
the currency at a lower exchange rate that will help maintain
competitiveness, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told TV Band.  “We cannot lose competitiveness at a time like this,”
Mantega told Band in an  interview  published on the broadcaster’s
website today.  Brazil’s real, whose 10.6 percent decline against the U.S.
dollar over the past three months makes it the worst performer
among all 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, was down 0.2
percent to 2.0335 at 10:26 a.m. local time.  Brazilian manufacturers have lost market share in recent
years to goods from China as the strong real has lowered the
cost of imports. Before Europe’s worsening debt crisis led
investors to dump riskier emerging market assets, President
 Dilma Rousseff ’s government had raised taxes in a bid to stem
foreign capital inflows that boosted the real to a 12-year high
of 1.5391 per  U.S. dollar  on July 26, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
