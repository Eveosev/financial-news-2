Taiwan’s dollar touched the lowest
level in almost two weeks and  government bonds  gained on concern
 China , the island’s biggest trading partner, is struggling to
revive its economy.  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said downward pressure on the
economy is still “relatively large” and the government will
intensify fine-tuning of policies, according to a report from
state-run Xinhua News Agency yesterday. U.S. employers added
fewer workers to payrolls than forecast last month, data showed
on July 6. Taiwan’s exports fell 3.2 percent last June from a
year earlier, a fourth consecutive month of declines, official
data showed today.  “Concern over growth in China and the U.S. is looming over
the markets,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei. “There won’t be too much room for
yields to go down much further unless the central bank cuts
interest rates in September.”  The  Taiwan dollar  fell 0.2 percent to NT$29.975 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$30.010 earlier, the weakest level since June 26. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, held at 3.80 percent.  Taiwan’s central bank, which left borrowing costs unchanged
at 1.875 percent last month, will next review its benchmark
 interest rate  in September.  Consumer prices in China rose 2.2 percent in June from a
year earlier, the least since January 2010, according to
official data released today.  The yield on the 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 dropped
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 1.21 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the lowest level
since June 26. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was steady
at 0.507 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
