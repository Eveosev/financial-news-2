Lending money to euro-region
countries such as  Spain  and  Italy  that are struggling to cut
their budget deficits won’t solve their fiscal difficulties or
save the euro, Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  said.  “You cannot solve this with loans,” he told reporters
before a meeting of euro-area finance ministers in Brussels
today. “But you have to fundamentally solve the problems of
these countries. Spain’s government has said ‘we will do this.’
The commitment is there, though it takes time.”  European Union leaders agreed at a June summit to ease the
way to direct financing for troubled banks, start work on
Europe-wide bank supervision and ease access to the region’s
bailout mechanisms. Finance ministers, who are meeting today and
again on July 20, have been asked to hammer out the details amid
a worsening debt crisis.  Spanish Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  pleaded with other
euro-area countries on July 7 to make good on the June summit
pledges, which include the option of government bond purchases
by  Europe ’s rescue funds for countries meeting the euro’s
existing debt and deficit rules.  Spain, which has the region’s third-biggest budget
shortfall, last month became the fourth euro-area country to
seek a bailout to prop up banks burdened with bad loans. With
Spain’s 10-year bond yields climbing back above 7 percent today,
investors remain skeptical, de Jager said.  “They have to convince markets that what they do is good
and is good enough,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
