Aubrey Lee Price, a former banker in
 Georgia  accused of stealing $17 million, is believed to be a
fugitive, the FBI said.  Price, 45, was charged June 28 with  wire fraud  in federal
court in Brooklyn, New York, for allegedly embezzling funds he
had agreed to invest on behalf of Montgomery Bank & Trust. The
Ailey, Georgia-based bank was closed on July 6 and its deposits
were handed over to Ameris Bank of Moultrie, Georgia, according
to a statement from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Price disappeared after telling acquaintances he had lost
money through trading activities and he planned to commit
suicide, the  Federal Bureau of Investigation  said today in a
statement. He was last seen June 16 boarding a ferry in  Key
West , Florida, that was bound for Fort Myers, Florida, the FBI
said.  While he was a manager of the bank’s holding company, PFGBI
LLC, Price transferred as much of $21 million to certain
securities accounts and lied about the balances, according to a
criminal complaint.  “The scheme Mr. Price allegedly ran is unfortunately one
the FBI is all too familiar with,” Janice K. Fedarcyk, head of
the FBI’s New York office, said in the statement. “By creating
bogus statements with falsified balances and returns, Mr. Price
was able to hide mounting investment losses as well as his own
monetary gain.”  The case is U.S. v. Price, 1:12-mj-00621, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of  New York  (Brooklyn).  To contact the reporter on this story:
