Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  said a report by a government-appointed panel that
concluded that Jewish settlements in the  West Bank  are legal
will be studied by a committee of Cabinet ministers.  Netanyahu appointed the committee in January to examine the
status of unauthorized settlement outposts in the West Bank as
he struggles to defuse political tensions over the outposts,
which are backed by some factions in his coalition and within
his Likud party. The committee concluded that outposts should be
granted official status whenever possible and that building in
the West Bank was legal.  “This report relates to the legality and legitimacy of
settlements in Judea and Samaria,” Netanyahu said at a briefing
in Jerusalem today broadcast on  Army Radio , referring to the
West Bank by its biblical name.  The  United Nations  and other international bodies have said
Israeli settlements in the West Bank violate international law
against construction on occupied territory. The U.S. has asked
Israel to freeze such construction and the Palestinian Authority
has said it will not negotiate directly with Netanyahu’s
government unless it does so.  To contact the reporter on this story:
