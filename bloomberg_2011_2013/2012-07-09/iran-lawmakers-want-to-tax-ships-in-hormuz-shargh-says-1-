Several Iranian lawmakers plan to
propose a bill to impose tariffs on ships sailing through the
Strait of Hormuz,  Shargh  reported, citing Alireza Khosravi, a
member of the nation’s parliament.  Ships of certain countries transit the waterway at the
mouth of the  Persian Gulf  “under pretexts such as security,”
Khosravi said. Nations whose oil tankers and other vessels exit
or enter the Gulf must compensate for the environmental damage
they cause there, he said, according to the Tehran-based
newspaper. Khosravi didn’t identify specific countries or
provide details of the draft bill, Shargh reported today.  Another parliamentarian, Mehdi Mousavinejad, said lawmakers
may ask the legislative body to consider a proposal to restrict
ship traffic in Hormuz, according to the state-run  Fars news
agency . They will review the measure when the parliament
reconvenes after a summer break, Fars reported today. Lawmakers
are scheduled to return to work on July 22, according to the
parliament’s news service.  The  Strait of Hormuz  between  Iran  and Oman is a transit
point for about 20 percent of the world’s traded oil and 33
percent of the supply of liquefied natural gas. Some Iranian
officials have threatened to disrupt shipping there in response
to stricter economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European
Union. Iran’s Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, has said the
country will do all it can to ensure the safe shipment of crude
from the Gulf.  To contact the reporter on this story:
