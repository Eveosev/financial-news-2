Monsanto Co. (MON) , the world’s biggest
seed company, sold equal $250 million portions of 10- and 30-
year bonds at its record low coupons to repay maturing
obligations.  The company issued the 2.2 percent, 10-year notes to yield
70 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and the
3.6 percent, 30-year bonds with a 100 basis-point spread,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds from the sale,
Monsanto’s largest since 2008, will be used to repay $486
million of 7.375 percent notes due August 15, the St. Louis-
based company said today in a regulatory filing. The coupon on
the 10-year bond is the company’s lowest, beating its 2.75
percent, five-year debt sold in April 2011, Bloomberg data show.  “Stable earnings, driven by elevated corn and soybean
prices, should support a tight spread for the company in this
volatile  bond market ,” Min Tang-Varner, an analyst at Chicago-
based Morningstar Inc., wrote today in a research note.
“Monsanto’s business profile and underlying sales should be
robust in the current economic environment.”  The new 30-year senior notes are expected to be rated A1 by
Moody’s Investors Service, its fifth-highest level, Bloomberg
data show. Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase
& Co., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and  Wells Fargo & Co .
managed the offering, according to the filing.  Monsanto, which has $2.05 billion of bonds outstanding,
sold a combined total of $550 million of 10- and 30-year
securities in April 2008, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
