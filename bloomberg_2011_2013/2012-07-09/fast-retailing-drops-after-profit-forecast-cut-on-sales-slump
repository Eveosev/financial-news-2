Fast Retailing Co. (9983) , the Japanese
retailer of Uniqlo brand apparel, fell the most in a month in
Tokyo trading after cutting its forecast for annual profit amid
a decline in domestic clothing sales.  The retailer  dropped  2.5 percent, the biggest decline since
June 8, to 15,400 yen at the close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Net income will probably be 79 billion yen ($993 million) for
the year ending August, lower than its previous forecast of 81.5
billion yen, the company said July 6 in a statement, after the
market closed.  The casual clothing maker, led by billionaire President
 Tadashi Yanai , has expanded outside of  Japan  amid a sales slump
in its home market. Same-store sales at its Uniqlo stores in
Japan fell 7 percent in June.  Uniqloâ€™s Japan comparable-store sales declined 5.4 percent
in the three months ended May as lower temperatures damped
demand for summer clothing, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
