Treasury 30-year  bonds  rallied,
leading gains among  U.S. government debt , after Wall Street
firms tendered fewer than average of the securities during
today’s Federal Reserve Operation Twist purchase.  Primary dealers submitted offers equaling 2.32 times the
$1.804 billion of securities bought by the Fed, down from an
average ratio of 2.93 since the central bank began the program
in October. Yields on benchmark 10-year notes touched the lowest
in more than a month as investors speculated slowing employment
growth will prompt the Fed to begin a third round of assets
purchases, which has become known as quantitative easing.  “There was an aggressive buyback and there wasn’t a lot of
submitted, and when there isn’t a big submission, the Fed is
often forced to pay up for their securities, and its pushing the
market higher,” said  Scott Sherman , an interest-rate strategist
in New York at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the Fed’s 21
primary dealers that are required to submit offers. “The market
is starting to view the possibility of QE3 or some further
stimulus with increased probability.”  Yields on 30-year bonds fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.62 percent at 5:02 p.m. New York time,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 3 percent security
due May 2042 rose 28/32, or $8.75 per $1,000 face amount, to 107
26/32.  Ten-year note  yields  declined four basis points to 1.51
percent, the lowest level since June 5. The 10-year rate dropped
10 basis points last week. The all-time low yield was 1.44
percent set on June 1.  European Debt  Treasuries gains in European trading as Spanish and Italian
debt fell amid concern euro-area finance ministers will fail to
stem the region’s financial woes.  Spain ’s 10-year bond yields climbed 11 basis points to 7.07
percent, while rates on similar-maturity  Italian securities 
advanced nine basis points to 6.12 percent. The euro slid to as
low as $1.2251, the weakest level since July 2010.  “Low-for-long lives on,”  William O’Donnell , head U.S.
government bond strategist at the  Stamford , Connecticut-based
RBS Securities primary dealer unit of Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc., wrote in a note to clients. “The winds continue to
blow favorably for Treasuries, and safe haven assets
generally.”  After breaking below the 1.55 percent level, Treasury 10-
year yields are poised to test 1.45 percent, O’Donnell wrote.  Fed Purchases  Federal  Reserve Bank  of Boston President  Eric Rosengren ,
speaking at a conference in Bangkok earlier today, said a
struggling U.S. labor market threatens to slow household
spending. The  unemployment rate  has been more than 8 percent
since February 2009. Rosengren do not vote on monetary policy
this year.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of
so-called quantitative easing, known as QE1 and QE2, from 2008
to 2011 to support the economy. In September it embarked on a
plan to replace $400 billion of short-maturity Treasuries in its
portfolio with longer-term debt to cap borrowing costs. It
expanded the effort, known as Operation Twist, on June 20 by
$267 billion and extended it until year-end.  Dealers submitted $4.185 billion of offers at today’s Fed
purchase.  Average Offers  Wall Street’s primary dealers are increasingly choosing to
hoard their U.S. bonds rather than sell them to the Fed.  Dealers  offered  an average of $7.2 billion in Treasuries a
day to the central bank in June, down 40.5 percent from a high
of $12.1 billion in October, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $32 billion of three-year
notes tomorrow, $21 billion of 10-year securities the next day
and $13 billion of 30-year bonds on July 12.  “The Street has given up on predicting what us going to
happen in the short run with regards to  Europe , and people are
staying away from taking any large risks,” said Paul Horrmann,
a broker in  New York  at Tradition Asiel Securities Inc., an
interdealer broker. “Short-term trading in this market is very
difficult as there aren’t many sellers. It would be nice to get
price concession heading into the auctions, but it doesn’t look
like we are going to get it.”  The government last week reported an 80,000 June jobs gain
that fell short of the 100,000 increase projected by economists
in a Bloomberg News survey.  “Failure to act aggressively now will lower the capacity
of the economy for many years to come,” Federal Reserve Bank of
Chicago President  Charles Evans  said at the same conference in
Bangkok. “I support using our balance sheet to provide
additional accommodation.”  The difference in yields between 10-year notes and TIPS,
which represents traders’ expectations for the rate of inflation
over the life of the securities and is known as the break-even
rate, was 2.07 percentage points, down from the 2012 high of
2.45 percentage points on March 20. It touched a 2012 low of 1.9
percentage points on Jan. 3.  “There is a lot of uncertainty about growth domestically
and uncertainty abroad that continues to keep yields low,” said
 Adrian Miller , a fixed-income strategist at GMP Securities LLC
in New York, said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
