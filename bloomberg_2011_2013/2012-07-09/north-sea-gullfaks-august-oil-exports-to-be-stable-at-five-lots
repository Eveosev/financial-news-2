Exports of North Sea Gullfaks crude
for August will be unchanged from this month at five cargoes of
800,000 barrels each, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  Loadings of Statfjord will increase to four cargoes of
855,000 barrels each, one more than July, while exports of Grane
will fall by one lot to six 600,000-barrel shipments, according
to separate schedules.  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Norway â€™s largest oil and gas producer,
operates the three fields. Loading programs are monthly
schedules of crude shipments compiled by field operators to
allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and trading
activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
