The Australian dollar touched the
lowest level in more than a week against its U.S counterpart for
a second day before a report tomorrow forecast to show Australia
failed to gain jobs in June.  The Aussie and the  New Zealand dollar  dropped against the
majority of their 16 most-traded peers after the official Xinhua
News Agency reported Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the
government will intensify fine-tuning of its policies in
response to downside risks to economic growth. European finance
ministers met yesterday in Brussels in to discuss measures to
ease the region’s debt crisis.  The Australian dollar slid as much as 0.6 percent to
$1.0155 yesterday in  New York , the lowest level since June 29,
before trading little changed at $1.0208. The Aussie fell 0.2
percent to 81.21 yen. New Zealand’s currency, nicknamed the
kiwi, fell 0.2 percent to 79.64 U.S. cents. It depreciated 0.3
percent to 63.37 yen.  The Chinese leader’s comments came after the South Pacific
nation’s biggest trading partner announced the second interest-
rate cut in a month.  Stocks fell, with the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  declining
0.2 percent and the  MSCI World Index (MXWO)  dropping 0.4 percent.  Australia’s  unemployment rate  rose to 5.2 percent in June,
from 5.1 percent the previous month, according to the median
 estimate  of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News before the
statistics bureau in Sydney releases the data tomorrow. The
nation added 38,900 jobs in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
