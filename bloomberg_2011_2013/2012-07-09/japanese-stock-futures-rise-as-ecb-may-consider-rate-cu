Japanese and Australian  stock 
 futures  advanced after European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  signaled policy makers may be open to another interest-
rate cut. Gains may be limited as rising borrowing costs in
Spain stoked concern about  Europe ’s debt crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , which gets
17 percent of its revenue in Europe, rose 0.6 percent from the
closing share price in Tokyo. Those of Alumina Ltd., an
Australian resource company, climbed 1.6 percent after industry
bellwether Alcoa Inc. reported better-than-expected profit,
opening U.S. earnings season. Shares of Japan Prime Realty
Investment Corp. may be active after announcing a share-sale
plan.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  expiring in
September closed at 8,920 in Chicago yesterday, up from 8,880 in
Osaka,  Japan . They were bid in the pre-market at 8,910 in Osaka
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index added 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index lost
0.2 percent in Wellington.  In Europe, “they come out with nice, encouraging things,
and the market has a bit of rally,” said Matt Riordan, who
helps manage about $6.5 billion in Sydney at Paradice Investment
Management Pty. “Then, immediately it becomes clear that
there’s a long-term frame and you tend to find disagreements
among different countries.”  Spanish Yields  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPXL1)  slid 0.2 percent
today. The index fell 0.2 percent in New York yesterday after
the yield on Spain’s 10-year bond rose above the 7 percent
threshold that prompted bailouts in Greece, Ireland and
Portugal. German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  dismissed a
rapid move toward direct bank recapitalization by the European
rescue fund, limiting the tools for shoring up Spanish banks.  The ECB last week cut its main  interest rates  by 25 basis
points, taking the benchmark to a record low of 0.75 percent and
the deposit rate to zero. Policy makers next review borrowing
costs on Aug. 2.  “We have to look at what the situation is, the data and
the developments, and then we will make up our minds on the
Governing Council what to do,” Draghi told lawmakers in
Brussels yesterday when asked if the central bank could cut
rates again.  Alcoa, the largest U.S. aluminum producer, said profit
excluding a charge related a proposed settlement of Aluminium
Bahrain BSC’s lawsuit and other items was 6 cents a share,
compared with the 5 cent average of 19 estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales fell 9.4 percent to $5.96 billion from $6.59
billion, exceeding the $5.81 billion average of 11 estimates.  Share Sale  Japan Prime Realty, a real-estate investment trust, said it
plans to raise as much as 22 billion yen ($276 million) in a
share sale to finance a property acquisition and repay debt.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 2.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 7.5 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 3.7 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600
Index. Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 11.8 times
estimated earnings on average, compared with 13 times for the
S&P 500 and 10.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  Chinese stocks traded in the U.S. fell after a report
yesterday showed inflation eased to the lowest since January
2010. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese companies in New York dropped 1.7 percent to 89.55, the
most since June 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
