Statoil ASA (STL) , Norway’s largest energy
company, closed little changed in Oslo after rising earlier on
speculation the government could intervene in a two-week strike
that threatens to halt all offshore oil and gas production.  Statoil closed down 0.2 percent at 140.80 kroner. It
earlier rose as much as 1.1 percent. Oslo’s benchmark index
dropped 0.5 percent.  Oil companies in Norway, western Europe’s largest crude
exporter, have said a shutdown will start at midnight unless
unions and employers can resolve the dispute over pensions or
the state steps in. The threat is intended to force the
government to end the impasse via compulsory arbitration, as
happened in 1997, 2000 and 2004, said Teodor Sveen Nilsen, an
analyst at  Swedbank AB. (SWEDA)   “With the two sides far apart, achieving a negotiated
consensus looks difficult and a fast resolution only looks
possible with an imposed settlement,”  Trevor Sikorski , a
London-based analyst at Barclays Plc, wrote in an e-mailed
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
