Iran ’s president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
has designed a one-year plan to avert the effects of increasing
sanctions against the nation,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing a
top official.  Ahmadinejad made the comments in a July 7 meeting when he
gave a briefing on Iran’s economic situation to the Expediency
Council, which has the final say in disputes on legislation,
Mohsen Rezai, the council’s secretary said, according to the
Tehran-based newspaper. The president participated along with
the Central Bank governor, the oil, economy and finance, and
industries, mines and commerce ministers, Donya said.  Western-led sanctions against Iran have created problems in
the past 2 years and pressure has intensified in the last six
months leading to “a drop in the foreign currency revenues,”
“complications for banking transfers,” and “restrictions on
ships that bring goods to Iran,” the government said, according
to Rezai.  Details given speak of “a dastardly economic war against
the country and its people,” Rezai was quoted as saying. The
president and ministers said they disapprove of “high prices
that are pressuring people” inside the country, he added,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
