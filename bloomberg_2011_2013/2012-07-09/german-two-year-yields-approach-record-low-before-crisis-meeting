Spanish 10-year bonds fell, pushing
the yield to more than 7 percent, amid concern euro-area finance
ministers meeting in Brussels will fail to agree to sufficient
crisis-fighting measures to stem the region’s economic woes.  Italian securities slipped for the fourth day, sending the
10-year yield to the highest in more than a week. German  two-
year note  yields dropped below zero for a second day as the
government sold six-month bills at a record-low yield of minus
0.0344 percent, while France auctioned similar-maturity debt at
at a negative yield for the first time. Spanish 30-year bond
rates advanced to a euro-era record.  “The market doesn’t have great expectations of the
summit,” said Achilleas Georgolopoulos, a fixed-income
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in  London . “That
continues to put pressure on peripheral bonds.”  The Spanish 10-year yield rose 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 7.06 percent at 4:32 p.m. London time,
after touching 7.11 percent, the highest since June 19 and
approaching the euro-era record of 7.285 percent reached on June
18. The 5.85 percent bond due January 2022 fell 0.7, or 7 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,230) face amount, to 91.725. Spanish 30-year
bond yields were three basis points higher at 7.29 percent,
after rising to a euro-era record 7.327 percent.  The rate on 10-year Italian debt climbed eight basis points
to 6.11 percent and reached 6.18 percent, the highest since June
28.  The euro was little changed at $1.2300, after falling 3
percent last week, the biggest weekly decline since September.
It slid to as low as $1.2251 today, the weakest level since July
2010.  ‘Move Quickly’  European finance ministers are gathering today to discuss
crisis measures adopted by heads of government at a summit last
month, when they agreed to relax conditions on emergency loans
for Spanish banks.  “I think the market is doubting the will of politicians,”
said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at Rabobank
International in London. “It’s easy to make broad-brush
statements, but actually to implement this stuff is pretty
difficult.”  Germany  sold 3.29 billion euros of six-month bills at a
record-low yield of minus 0.0344 percent, according to a
statement from the Bundesbank today. That’s less than a yield of
0.007 percent at the previous auction of similar-maturity debt
on June 11.  The German two-year yield was little changed at zero after
falling to minus 0.013 percent, approaching a record of minus
0.018 percent reached on July 6. The 10-year bund yield was at
1.33 percent.  Italian Volatility  Volatility on  Austria ’s government debt was the second-
highest in developed markets behind  Belgium  today, according to
measures of 10-year bonds, the spread between two- and 10-year
securities, and credit-default swaps. Its two-year note yield
fell two basis points to 0.16 percent.  Italy’s two-year yield rose 28 basis points to 4.14 percent
and Spanish two-year rates increased nine basis points to 5.02
percent.  France  sold 1.99 billion euros of six-month bills at a
yield of minus 0.006 percent, the first time the nation agreed
to a negative rate on the securities since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in 1999.  French five-year yields fell to 1 percent for the first
time before climbing back to 1.04 percent.  German  government bonds  returned 1.5 percent this month,
extending this year’s gain to 3.6 percent, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Spanish securities lost 2.6 percent in July,
bringing this year’s decline to 6.1 percent, the indexes showed.  The German 10-year rate may decline toward its record-low
1.127 percent, set on June 1, as it maintains a break below its
50-day moving average at 1.445 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
