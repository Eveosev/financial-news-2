Electricite de  France  SA started its
910-megawatt Gravelines-1 nuclear power plant on July 7 after an
unplanned halt on June 4, according to data from French grid
operator Reseau de Transport d’Electricite.  EDF halted its 910-megawatt Gravelines-2 nuclear power
reactor in France yesterday for three days of planned
maintenance, according to RTE data.  Europe ’s biggest power generator presently has 19 reactors
offline, bringing France’s available nuclear capacity to 67
percent, according to calculations based on the latest RTE data,
compared with 82 percent on July 1 last year.  EDF’s 58 nuclear plants generate about 75 percent of the
country’s power.  The following table lists EDF’s atomic units that are out
of service, their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
stopped and the expected return date, if known, according to
RTE. Two asterisks highlight an unplanned halt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
