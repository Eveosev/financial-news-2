About 64 percent of Romanian voters
will impeach suspended President Traian Basescu in a referendum
later this month on whether he should be reinstated or ousted
from office, according to a survey.  Approximately 27 percent of voters support Basescu’s
reinstatement while 8.3 percent are undecided or didn’t want to
take part in the survey,  according to a poll  by Bucharest-based
polling company IMAS for radio station Europa FM. The July 5-7
survey of an unspecified number of voters had a margin of error
of 3 percentage points.  Romanian lawmakers suspended Basescu last week amid
accusations that he overstepped his duties when announcing state
wage cuts in 2010 and other economic decisions. His popularity
plunged after backing the austerity measures and Basescu’s
political future will be decided in the referendum scheduled for
July 29.  Parliament on June 26 approved a change in the law
governing referenda, making a balloting for impeachment valid
with a majority of participants rather than with more than 50
percent of eligible voters. The ruling coalition also limited
the powers of the  Constitutional Court  by decree on July 4 to
prevent it from impeding a presidential suspension procedure.  The opposition has challenged Parliament’s changes to the
law at the court, which is expected to rule today, news service
 Mediafax  reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
