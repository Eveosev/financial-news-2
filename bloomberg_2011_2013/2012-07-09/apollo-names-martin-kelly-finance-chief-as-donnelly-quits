Apollo Global Management LLC (APO) , the
private-equity firm run by  Leon Black , named Martin Kelly chief
financial officer, replacing Gene Donnelly who is resigning to
pursue other interests.  Kelly, most recently CFO of the Americas for Barclays
Capital, will take over no later than Oct. 1, the New York-based
firm said in a statement today. Donnelly, 54, will continue to
advise Apollo through the end of the year.  “Gene has made significant contributions to Apollo and was
instrumental in the IPO process and our transition to a public
company listed on the New York Stock Exchange,” Black said in
the statement. “During his tenure, the company strengthened its
balance sheet and financial operations.”  Kelly, 44, has worked at Barclays and Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. since 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
