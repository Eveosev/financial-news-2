China ’s one-year interest-rate swap
rate touched the lowest level in almost a month on speculation
easing inflation will give the central bank more room to relax
monetary policy.  Consumer prices  climbed 2.2 percent in June from a year
earlier, the least in 29 months, the statistics bureau said
today. China’s central bank gauged demand for seven- and 14-day
reverse-repurchase contract sales this week, according to a
trader required to bid at the auctions.  “The CPI may trend lower every month till October,” said
Guo Caomin, a bond analyst at Industrial Bank Co. in  Shanghai .
“The central bank may cut the reserve ratio this month if
June’s lending is less than 800 billion  yuan  ($126 billion).”  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, declined two
basis points to 2.45 percent as of 4:47 p.m. in Shanghai,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 2.42 percent,
the lowest level since June 11.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped 13 basis points to 3.36 percent,
according to a weighted average rate compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center.  The yield on the 3.51 percent government bond due February
2022 fell three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.25
percent, according to the Interbank Funding Center.  China’s finance ministry sold 23.9 billion yuan of three-
year bonds today at a yield of 2.75 percent on behalf of local
governments, according to a statement on Chinabond. The
securities were issued on behalf of Beijing, Shanxi,
Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Ningxia and Qinghai.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Sandy Hendry, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
