Rains in  China ’s northeast provinces,
the country’s top grain-growing region, are helping the growth
of corn and soybeans, Grain.gov.cn said.  The provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang,  Inner Mongolia  and
Liaoning received above-average rains in June, easing dry
conditions, the state-owned researcher said in an e-mailed
report today. Corn growth is “normal” while rains may boost
soybean crops, it said.  While dry conditions persist in the Huanghuai region,
including Hebei, Shandong and Henan, corn crops, which are still
in the young seedling stage, are “all right overall” given
access to irrigation, the researcher said.  “Strong-to-heavy rain” is forecast for Huanghuai today
after as much as 80 millimeters (3.15 inches) fell last night,
the China Meteorological Administration said in a report on its
website today.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
