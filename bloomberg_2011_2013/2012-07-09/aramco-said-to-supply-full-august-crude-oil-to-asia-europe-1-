Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the worldâ€™s
largest crude exporter, will supply full volumes in August to
customers in Asia and  Europe , unchanged from this month,
according to refinery officials with knowledge of the matter.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will provide 100
percent of crude cargoes sold under long-term contracts, said
seven Asian and three European refiners, who declined to be
identified because the agreements are confidential.  The kingdom in March exported 710,000 barrels a day of Arab
Light and Extra Light blend, 90,000 barrels of Arab Medium, and
70,000 barrels of Arab Heavy grade to European members of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development except
Hungary, the  International Energy Agency  said in its monthly oil
market report on June 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
