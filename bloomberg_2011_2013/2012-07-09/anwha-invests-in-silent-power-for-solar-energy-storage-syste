Hanwha Group, a closely held South
Korean industrial conglomerate, plans to offer energy-storage
systems from  Silent Power Inc.  with solar panels from its  Hanwha
SolarOne (HSOL)  unit.  The bundled offering with solar panels and storage will be
available to residential, commercial and industrial customers in
September, according to a statement today. Hanwha invested $8
million in Baxter, Minnesota-based Silent Power and was the sole
participant in its Series B financing round, John Frederick, a
spokesman for Silent Power, said by telephone.  Storage technology will increase the value of solar
systems, which operate intermittently and often aren’t
generating electricity when energy use on the grid peaks, Hanwha
said.  Silent Power supplies the electronics and incorporates
batteries from other manufacturers, including  Saft Groupe SA (SAFT)  and
 GS Yuasa Corp. (6674) , to build its systems, Frederick said. “We do
everything but the battery,” he said.  Silent Power’s systems supply energy directly to customers
or  utility companies  seeking to power the grid during periods of
peak demand. The company says it’s working on more than a dozen
storage projects with U.S. utilities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
