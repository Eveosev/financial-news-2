HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s largest
bank, is advising on potential acquisitions of renewable-energy
companies as an oversupply of equipment in the wind and solar
industries drives down prices.  “We are at present advising on a number of cross-border
mergers and acquisitions deals,” Jaume Pujol, managing director
and head of European Renewables for London-based HSBC, said in a
telephone interview.  The renewable-energy industry is consolidating as cuts to
subsidies in countries including Germany and Spain slow growth,
he said. Industrial and energy companies are seeking to shift
from developed, mature markets to emerging regions that are
growing, including  Saudi Arabia ,  South America  and Asia.  “Those companies that traditionally have been local or
regional now need to become more global, requiring substantial
amounts of capital,” Pujol said.  Prices for solar panels fell 45 percent in the past year,
and wind turbine prices  dropped  6 percent in the 12 months
through the end of the second quarter, according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance.  HSBC is also working on “equity raisings” for some
clients considering expanding their portfolios and is evaluating
financing opportunities for wind and solar projects, especially
in  emerging markets , he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
