within neighborhoods in 40 states to negotiate better prices
with solar-panel suppliers and installers, according to its
 website .  “They are very good at acquiring customers,” Chris Stern,
a spokesman for Pure Energies, said in an interview. “We bring
the engineering, procurement and construction piece and we’re
going to be hiring.” Terms weren’t disclosed in a statement
