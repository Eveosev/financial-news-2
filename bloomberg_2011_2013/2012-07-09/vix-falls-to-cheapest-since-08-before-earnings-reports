The biggest June rally in U.S. stocks
since 1999 has pushed options prices to the lowest level before
any earnings season in almost four years even as analysts
predict profits will fall.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
tracks the cost of contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index,
has lost 36 percent since its 2012 peak last month. It slipped
6.8 percent below the  S&P 500 ’s 20-day historical volatility, a
measure of actual swings, on July 6, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. That’s the cheapest contracts have been one trading day
before  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  reports profit since October 2008.  Optimism that an agreement among European leaders on banks
will help contain the region’s debt crisis and a 6 percent rally
in the S&P 500 since June 1 has helped lower options prices,
according to Scott Maidel of Russell Investments. The VIX has
increased a median of 7.9 percent during the first month of
second-quarter reporting periods dating back to 2002, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are just starting to see investors re-initiate hedges
before earnings and as European concerns reemerge,” Maidel, who
helps oversee $141 billion as a  money manager  for equity
derivatives at Russell Investments in  Seattle , said in a July 6
interview. “The low absolute level of VIX and a good price
entry point for the S&P 500 make for a reasonable combination to
seek downside protection.”  VIX, VStoxx  The VIX snapped a four-week streak of losses last week,
rising 0.1 percent to 17.10, after government data showed
slower-than-forecast growth in U.S. payrolls and European
Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  said the region’s economy
remains weak.  Europe ’s VStoxx Index, a measure of Euro Stoxx 50
Index option prices, climbed 2.5 percent last week and added 0.3
percent to 25.65 at 9:50 a.m. in  Frankfurt  today.  Alcoa begins the U.S. earnings season today with second-
quarter results from the largest U.S. aluminum producer
scheduled to be released after the close of regular trading.
Analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg project a 1.8 percent
decline in profits for S&P 500 companies in the April-June
period, which would mark the first year-over-year decrease since
2009, even as revenue increased 2.5 percent.  Option traders are increasing wagers that volatility will
rise. The ratio of calls to buy the  IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term
Futures ETN (VXX)  relative to puts to sell rose to 0.79-to-1 on July
5, near its highest level since January, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Ownership of  calls  to buy the U.S.
exchange-traded note that tracks VIX futures rose 59 percent to
889,222 since the June 15 options expiration. During that time,
open interest for puts added 30 percent to 1.13 million.  ‘Downside Risks’  Investors will be gauging the effects of Europe’s debt
crisis on U.S. results. Some “downside risks to the euro-area
economic outlook have materialized,” Draghi said last week
after ECB policy makers lowered the main refinancing rate to a
record low of 0.75 percent and took the deposit rate to zero.  Global economic growth needs to improve for the VIX to
remain at its current level, said Sequent Asset Management LLC’s
 Tim Hartzell . The volatility gauge is 17 percent below its 22-
year average of 20.53.  “For the VIX to stay low we need to see a better  China , a
better Europe, better  emerging markets  leading to a better
American economy,” Hartzell, who oversees about $350 million as
chief investment officer at Sequent in Houston, said yesterday
in a phone interview.  Economy Watch  The People’s Bank of China last week allowed banks to offer
bigger discounts on loans, stepping up efforts to reverse a
slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy. The moves
coincided with the ECB’s decision to reduce borrowing costs to a
record low and the Bank of England’s expansion of asset
purchases.  The  U.S. economy  is forecast to strengthen for the next two
years, with gross domestic product rising 2.2 percent in 2012,
2.4 percent in 2013 and 2.8 percent in 2014, according to the
median estimate from economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Traders are speculating that lockstep moves among S&P 500
stocks will ease as more than half of the companies in the S&P
500 are due to announce quarterly profits this month. The CBOE
S&P 500 Implied Correlation Index, a gauge that uses options to
measure expectations about whether the 50 biggest S&P 500 stocks
will move in unison, has lost  12 percent  to 66.01 since a four-
month high on June 13, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
index touched its lowest level since April on July 3.  The U.S. unemployment rate held at 8.2 percent in June,
according to a Labor Department report last week. The Citigroup
Economic Surprise Index for the U.S., which measures how much
reports are missing or beating the median estimates in Bloomberg
surveys, was at minus 62.50 on June 6, close to a  10-month low 
of minus 64.80 reached on June 21.  “It’s going to be a very uneven quarter,” Max Breier, a
senior equity derivatives trader at BMO Capital Markets Corp. in
 New York , said in a July 6 phone interview. “I don’t think
we’re out of the woods.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
