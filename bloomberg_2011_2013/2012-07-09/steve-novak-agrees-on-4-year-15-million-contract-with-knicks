Free-agent forward  Steve Novak  agreed
on a four-year, $15 million contract to remain with the  New York
Knicks , agent Mark Bartelstein said.  The Knicks also reached an agreement with the  Houston
Rockets  to re-acquire 38-year-old center Marcus Camby for three
players and two second-round National Basketball Association
draft picks, the  Associated Press  said, citing a person with
knowledge of the transaction who wished to remain anonymous.  The Rockets would get guard Toney Douglas and centers Josh
Harrelson and Jerome Jordan, in addition to a second-round pick
in both the 2013 and 2014 drafts, AP said. Camby played with the
Knicks from 1998-2002 and averaged 7.1 points and 9.3 rebounds
in 19 games for the Rockets last season.  Novak, 29, is returning to the Knicks, the fifth team he’s
played with since entering the NBA in 2006, after leading the
league by hitting 47 percent of his 3-pointers last season. He’s
a career 44 percent 3-point shooter.  Novak and Jeremy Lin are among the players who benefited
from an arbitrator’s decision last month that allows teams to
sign waived players without regard to the salary cap.  “That was a critical part of the process,” Bartelstein
said in a telephone interview. “Without that, Steve wouldn’t
have been able to stay in  New York .”  Lin will sign a four-year, $29 million offer sheet with the
Rockets on July 11, the first day players can sign contracts,
the AP reported. The Knicks have the right to match the offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
