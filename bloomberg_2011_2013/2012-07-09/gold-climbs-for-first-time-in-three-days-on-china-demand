Gold futures rose for the first time
in three sessions on signs of increasing demand in  China .  In May, imports by China from  Hong Kong  jumped sixfold to
75,635.7 kilograms (75.6 metric tons) from a year earlier, Hong
Kong government data showed. The nation “remains the most
important player on the global gold market,” Commerzbank AG
said in a report. The dollar fell from a five-week high against
a basket of currencies, boosting the appeal of the metal as an
alternative investment.  “Higher physical demand in China is good news for the
market,” Sterling Smith, a commodity analyst at Citigroup
Inc.’s institutional client group in Chicago, said in a
telephone interview. “The mildly weak dollar is also
positive.”  Gold futures for August delivery rose 0.6 percent to settle
at $1,589.10 an ounce at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . The
price fell 2.6 percent in the previous two sessions.  The World Gold Council has forecast that China will top
India this year as the world’s largest consumer because rising
incomes will bolster demand.  Silver futures for September delivery jumped 1.9 percent to
$27.444 an ounce.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery dropped 0.2 percent to $1,445.90 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery advanced 0.6 percent to
$583.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
