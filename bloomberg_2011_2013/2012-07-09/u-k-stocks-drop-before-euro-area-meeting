  U.K. stocks  declined for a second
day before a meeting of euro-area finance ministers to discuss
the region’s debt crisis and amid concern that  China  may be
entering a phase of deflation.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  lost 21.76 points, or 0.4 percent, to
5,640.87 at 8:57 a.m. in  London . The gauge gained 1.6 percent
last week as the  Bank of England  expanded its bond-buying
program and surveys of manufacturing in economies from China to
the euro area beat economists’ estimates. The broader FTSE All-
Share Index fell 0.5 percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index
slipped 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
