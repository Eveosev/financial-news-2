A group led by ABS Partners Real
Estate LLC paid $140 million for a 20-story  office tower  in
 Manhattan ’s Flatiron District, seeking to capitalize on the
neighborhood’s popularity with information technology tenants.  The building at 915 Broadway is near the center of the
 Midtown South office market , which has the lowest vacancy rate
in the U.S., according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield Inc.
ABS, led by Chairman Earle Altman, had already owned a minority
stake in the 250,000-square-foot (2,300-square-meter) property.
His group teamed with Richard Hadar, Jeffrey Feil and John
Zirinsky on the purchase, ABS said today in a statement.  The price includes prepayment of an existing mortgage. The
building has a $37.5 million securitized senior loan originated
by JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. JPMorgan also financed the 915 Broadway deal through
Ackman-Ziff Real Estate Group, according to the statement.  Altman acquired a 15 percent stake in the building in 1981,
when he joined a group of investors who bought it for $6
million. Tenants in the tower, completed in 1926, include Jump
Associates LLC, Union Square Ventures and the  New York  campus of
the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine.  The partners intend to redesign and expand the building’s
lobbies, according to the statement. The 14,000-square-foot
retail space will be available for leasing in early 2014.  Office  rents  in  Midtown South , the area roughly between
34th Street and Canal Street, rose 9.7 percent in the year ended
June 30, brokerage Newmark Grubb Knight Frank said in a report
last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
