The ruble depreciated for a fourth
day against the dollar and yields on  Russia ’s international
bonds rose after signs global economic growth is slowing cut
demand for riskier assets.  The Russian currency lost 0.5 percent to 32.9825 per dollar
by the close in Moscow, the weakest level since June 28. The
country’s $2 billion of Eurobonds due April 2017 fell,
increasing the yield by two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 2.967 percent.  Investors pared bets on higher-yielding assets after
Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  said downward pressure on the world’s
second-biggest economy is still “relatively large.” Urals
crude oil, Russia’s main export, dropped 2 percent to $98.12 per
barrel by the July 6 close after the U.S. Labor Department
reported non-farm payrolls increased less than expected last
month. The commodity rose 0.5 percent to $98.61 per barrel
today.  “Local players see the ruble lower by the end of the
summer,” Kirill Grishanov, head of foreign-exchange and
interest-rate trading at OAO Promsvyazbank in Moscow, said by e-
mail. “The street is short on the ruble now, and expects it to
fall further to 34 or 35 by September.”  The ruble weakened 0.3 percent to 40.543 per euro and 0.4
percent to 36.3847 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket. Investors increased bets on the currency weakening, with
non-deliverable forwards showing the ruble at 33.506 per dollar
in three months, compared with expectations of 33.3865 per
dollar on July 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
