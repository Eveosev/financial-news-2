Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) , the
second-largest U.S. car-rental company, is building 11 solar
plants this year, including two at New York-area airports, as it
seeks to increase its use of renewable power.  Hertz has completed a project at its Park Ridge, New
Jersey, headquarters and is planning systems at  John F. Kennedy
International Airport  and Newark Liberty International Airport,
the company said today in a statement.  The projects are part of Hertz’s efforts to add renewable-
energy generation to its facilities. It’s planning eight
additional systems this year in Augusta and Macon, Georgia;
Denver, Los Angeles, Newark,  Boston  and New York, adding to the
seven systems installed at car- and equipment-rental locations
through 2011.  “The goal is to outfit as many of our locations here in
the U.S. and overseas with solar as possible,” Rich Broome,
Hertz’s senior vice president of corporate affairs and
communications, said today in an interview. Even as incentives
disappear, the company expects costs for solar power to continue
to come down, he said. “Solar makes sense for us.”  Hertz is paying to install the systems on low buildings and
covered roofs at its car- and equipment-rental facilities,
Broome said. Enterprise Holdings Inc. is the largest U.S. car-
rental company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
