Vietnam Oil & Gas Group, the state-
owned  oil company  known as PetroVietnam, said consolidated
pretax profit rose to 30.1 trillion dong ($1.4 billion) in the
first six months of the year.  Consolidated revenue also increased 20 percent to 203
trillion dong in the same period, PetroVietnam said in an e-
mailed statement today.  The Hanoi-based company said crude output reached 8.13
million metric tons, or 105.2 percent of its first-half target,
and 13 percent higher than the same period last year, according
to the statement. Condensate output also exceeded target in the
first six months, reaching 4.87 billion cubic meter.  Production from its Dung Quat oil refinery reached 2.63
million tons, or 44 percent of its 2012 target. The country’s
only refinery resumed full production on July 8 after shutting
for planned maintenance since May 15, Nguyen Viet Thang, deputy
general director of Binh Son Refinery & Petrochemical Co.,
operator of the plant, said by phone today.  PetroVietnam expects output this year of crude and
condensate to reach 24.9 million tons, of which crude production
may be 15.9 million tons, according to the statement.  The oil producer forecasts consolidated revenue at 412
trillion dong and pretax profit at 61.4 trillion dong this year,
according to the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
