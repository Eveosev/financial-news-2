Indonesia ’s rupiah dropped for a
fourth day and  government bonds  declined after a U.S. jobs
report missed estimates, adding to concern the global economy is
slowing and curbing demand for emerging-market assets.  The  MSCI Asia-Pacific Index (MXAP)  dropped the most in five weeks
after U.S. Labor Department data on July 6 showed June payrolls
increased by 80,000, compared with the 100,000 rise projected in
a Bloomberg survey. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said downward pressure on
the Chinese economy is still “relatively large,” the official
Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday. Global funds added 2.35
trillion rupiah ($249 million) to their holdings of government
bonds in the first three days of last week, finance ministry
data show.  “Global factors are keeping the rupiah from strengthening,
even after Indonesia began to attract foreign investment,” said
Apressyanti Senthaury, a Jakarta-based research analyst in the
treasury division at PT Bank Negara Indonesia. “The U.S. data
couldn’t ease the market’s concern.”  The rupiah fell 0.3 percent to 9,430 per dollar as of 3:41
p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg. The currency reached 9,468 today, the weakest
since June 29. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 8.25
percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent bonds due May 2022
climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to a one-
week high of 6.09 percent, according to prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
