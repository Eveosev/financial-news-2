South Korea ’s government bonds rose,
sending three-year yields to the lowest since 2010, and the won
slid as U.S. payroll gains trailed estimates, heightening
concern growth in the world’s biggest economy is slowing.  The 80,000 gain in employment for June followed a 77,000
increase in May and compares with a 100,000 jump projected in a
Bloomberg News survey, U.S Labor Department figures showed on
July 6. The euro touched a two-year low and the  Kospi (KOSPI)  Index of
shares fell to its lowest level since June 28 as overseas funds
sold more of the nation’s shares than it bought for the first
time in six days. The Bank of  Korea  will probably hold the
benchmark rate at 3.25 percent for a 13th month at the July 12
meeting, according to all 12 economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg
News.  “Demand for South Korean bonds is strong, and with global
economy data deteriorating, it looks like some investors are
betting the  Bank of Korea  will cut rates,” said Hwang Jae Hong,
who oversees 12 trillion won ($10.5 billion) as head of fixed
income at UBS Hana Asset Management in Seoul. “I don’t think
the central bank will lower the benchmark rate as long as  Europe 
comes up with ways to delay the crisis.”  The yield on the government’s 3.25 percent bonds due June
2015 slid two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.21
percent at the close in Seoul, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.
That’s the lowest rate for a  benchmark  three-year bond since
December 2010. Ten-year government notes fell two basis points
to 3.52 percent, a record low. Three-year debt futures advanced
0.09 to 105.01 and the one-year interest-rate swap slid five
basis points to 3.27 percent, the lowest since January 2011.  The won weakened 0.3 percent to 1,141.43 per dollar in
 Seoul , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
1,145.53 earlier, the weakest since July 2. The currency’s one-
month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used
to price options, jumped 33 basis points, or 0.33 percentage
point, to 7.50 percent.  “The won weakened on U.S. jobs data and the declining
euro, and foreigners beginning to sell Korean stocks again today
may affect the won if the trend continues,” said Kim Do Hee, a
Seoul-based currency dealer for Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
