Ukraine’s grain harvest yields are
expected to fall 20 percent to 25 percent on average because of
dry weather, said Tetiana Adamenko, head of the agro-meteorology
department at the National Meteorology Center.  Yields are seen between 30 percent and 40 percent lower
than last year in southern Ukraine due to hot weather, Adamenko
said at a press conference today in Kiev. Autumn drought damaged
winter crops and a lack of rainfall in the last quarter worsened
the situation, she said.  Ukraine’s harvest may fall to 42.8 million metric tons this
year, Nikolay Vernitsky, director of the Kiev-based agricultural
researcher ProAgro, said at the press conference. That compares
with a record 56.7 million tons in 2011, according to the
 Agriculture Ministry .  The country will probably reap 12.8 million tons of wheat,
6 million tons of barley and 21.7 million tons of corn, among
other grains this year, Vernitsky said.  Ukraine is seen exporting 20.8 million tons of grains in
the marketing year which started July 1, compared with 22
million tons to 23 million tons in 2011, Vernitsky said.  -- Editors: Sharon Lindores,  John Deane   To contact the reporter on this story:
