Emirates Aluminium Co., an Abu Dhabi-
based smelter, is in talks with Export-Import Bank of  Korea  for
a loan of as much as $300 million to help finance its expansion,
according to two people familiar with the matter.  The lender, known as Kexim, supports projects in which
Korean companies are involved and is considering a loan of $200
million to $300 million, the people said, declining to be
identified because the discussions are private. The bank
conducted the first due diligence on the project last week, said
one of the people, an official at the Seoul-based  state bank .  Emirates Aluminium plans to spend $4.5 billion to boost
annual output to 1.3 million metric tons by 2014 from 800,000
tons. The company, also known as Emal, expects to close
financing by the end of the year, Chief Executive Officer Saeed al-Mazrooei said in an interview last month.  Mubadala Development Co. and Dubai Aluminium Co., Emirates
Aluminium’s owners, want to arrange financing from  export credit
agencies  before they seek commercial funding, a third person
familiar with the project said.  A Mubadala spokesman declined to comment when asked about
Emal’s financing arrangements. Dubai Aluminium did not respond
to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
