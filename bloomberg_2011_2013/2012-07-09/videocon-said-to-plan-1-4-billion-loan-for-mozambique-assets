Videocon Industries Ltd. (VCLF) , controlled
by billionaire Venugopal Dhoot, plans to borrow as much as $1.4
billion to develop energy assets in  Mozambique , according to a
person familiar with the matter.  IDBI Bank Ltd. (IDBI)  and SBI Capital Markets Ltd. are arranging
the loan, the person said, asking not to be identified because
the information is private. The two arrangers are marketing the
debt to other lenders, the person said.  Videocon, based in the western Indian city of Aurangabad,
The Woodlands, Texas-based  Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)  and Indian
state refiner Bharat Petroleum Corp. operate 10,500 square
kilometers (2.6 million acres) of offshore gas fields in
Mozambique. The fields, called Offshore Area 1 of the deepwater
Rovuma Basin, hold at least 10 trillion cubic feet of gas, more
than the proven reserve of the U.K., Anadarko said in a
statement on Oct. 5.  Dhoot was not immediately available for comment when
reached on his mobile phone. Videocon has $1.8 billion of debt
due by 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Videocon fell 1.8 percent to 171.1 rupees at the close in
Mumbai. The stock has declined 1.9 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent gain in the BSE India Sensitive Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
