Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG) , Kenya’s biggest
producer of the sweetener, jumped to the highest in more than
eight months on bets full-year earnings will grow.  The stock gained 3.9 percent to 6.70 shillings as of the 3
p.m. close in Nairobi, the capital, the strongest level since
Nov. 1, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Guys are taking positions in anticipation of the
earnings,” Faith Atiti, an analyst at Nairobi-based Sterling
Investment Bank Ltd. said in a phone interview today. “We can
expect modest earnings growth and they have quite a good
dividend.”  Profit for the six months through December increased 6.2
percent to 881.3 million shillings ($10.5 million), the company
said Feb. 3. Mumias was rated strong buy in new coverage by Old
Mutual Securities, with a 12-month price estimate of 9.87
shillings, the Nairobi-based brokerage said in May.  Full-year cane production could be slightly lower than a
year earlier and earnings will be boosted by higher sugar
prices, Atiti said.  Mumias Sugar provides 60 percent of  Kenya ’s sugar through
appointed distributors across the east African nation. The
company also exports some of its sugar, at least 20,000 metric
tons annually, mainly to the European Union, according to the
company’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
