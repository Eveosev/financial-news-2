Coal export prices rose at  South
Africa ’s Richards Bay, the continent’s biggest terminal for
shipping the fuel, the longest streak of increases since April.  Prices added $2.81, or 3.2 percent, to $90.49 a metric ton
in the week ended July 6, according to IHS McCloskey data on
Bloomberg. That’s a third straight weekly gain. The price is
quoted on a free-on-board basis, which excludes delivery costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
