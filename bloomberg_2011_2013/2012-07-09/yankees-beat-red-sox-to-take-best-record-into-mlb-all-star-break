The  New York Yankees  beat the Boston
 Red Sox  7-3 to head into the three-day All-Star break with the
best record in  Major League Baseball .  Andruw Jones  hit a two-run home run yesterday, a day after
hitting three homers in a double-header in Boston, and Ivan Nova
struck out 10 batters over six innings for the Yankees.  With their third win in the four-game series, the Yankees
improve to a major league-best 52-33 at the All-Star break and
hold a seven-game lead over the second-place Baltimore Orioles
in the American League Eastern division. The Red Sox fell into a
tie for last place in the AL East with Toronto at 43-43.  Baseball’s 83rd All-Star Game is scheduled for tomorrow at
Kaufmann Stadium in Kansas City. The Yankees’ Robinson Cano will
lead the AL team in tonight’s All-Star Home Run Derby.  The  Texas Rangers , the two-time defending AL champions,
have baseball’s second-best record at the break at 52-34 after
defeating the Minnesota Twins 4-3 in 13 innings yesterday. The
Rangers have a four-game lead in the AL West over the Los
Angeles Angels, who are 42-24 since a 6-14 start.  The Chicago White Sox are in first place in the AL Central
at 47-38, three games ahead of the Cleveland Indians and 3 1/2
games in front of the Detroit Tigers.  The Washington Nationals, who haven’t been to the
postseason since moving from Montreal in 2005, lead the National
League with a 49-34 record at the All-Star break and have a
four-game lead over the Atlanta Braves in the NL East.  The second-best record in the NL belongs to the 48-37
Pittsburgh Pirates, who were last in the playoffs in 1992. The
Pirates are one game ahead of the second-place Cincinnati Reds
in the NL Central division.  The  Los Angeles Dodgers  (47-40) are one game ahead of the
San Francisco Giants in the NL West.  To contact the reporter on this story:
