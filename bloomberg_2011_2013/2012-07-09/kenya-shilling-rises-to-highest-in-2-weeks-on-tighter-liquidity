Kenya ’s shilling rallied to the
highest in more than two weeks as the central bank extended its
policy of withdrawing liquidity for a ninth consecutive day,
tightening money supply.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
for a second day, gaining 0.2 percent to close at 83.73 per
dollar, the strongest level on a closing basis since June 21,
having traded 0.5 percent stronger to 83.50 earlier in Nairobi,
the capital.  The Central Bank of Kenya has curbed money supply every day
since June 27. It has pulled 35.9 billion shillings ($428.1
million) through  repurchase agreements  and 27.4 billion
shillings by way of term-auction deposits, which are among the
tools the bank deploys to conduct open market operations.  “The persistent mopping-up by the central bank is
supporting the shilling as it curbs  money supply ,” Raphael
Agung, a dealer at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd.,
said in a phone interview.  The bank sold today 3.85 billion shillings of seven-day
repos at a weighted average rate of 15.25 percent, said an
official, who asked not to be identified in line with policy. It
also accepted 350 million shillings of bids for 21-day term
auction deposits at 15 percent and 810 million shillings in 28-
day deposits at 15.033 percent, the official said by telephone
from Nairobi.  Inflation  The bank cut its  benchmark lending rate  for the first time
in 18 months on July 5, reducing the key rate by 1.5 percentage
points to 16.5 percent as inflation nears the government’s 9
percent target. Inflation declined for the seventh straight
month to 10.1 percent from 12.2 percent in May, the Kenya
National Bureau of Statistics said in an e-mailed statement June
29.  The central bank raised borrowing costs by a record 12.25
percentage points in 2011 to help bolster the shilling and curb
price pressures following a drought.  The Tanzanian shilling and Ugandan shilling traded
unchanged at 1,590 per dollar and 2,480 per dollar,
respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
