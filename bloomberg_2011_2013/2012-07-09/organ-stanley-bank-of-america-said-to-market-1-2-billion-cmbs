Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  are marketing about $1.2 billion of bonds tied to
commercial property loans, according to people familiar with the
offering.  The deal is linked to 72 loans on 98 properties across the
U.S., said the person, who asked not to be identified because
terms aren’t set. Several classes of the transaction have been
placed in advance with investors, the people said. The total
mortgage balance is $1.35 billion.  Wall Street banks have arranged about $12 billion of
securities tied to skyscrapers, shopping malls and hotels this
year, compared with $28 billion in all of 2011, Bloomberg data
show. The largest loan in the pool from Morgan Stanley and Bank
of America is a $180 million mortgage on an  office tower  in
Baltimore, the people said.  Forecasts for 2012 issuance range from Wells Fargo’s $25
billion to Credit Suisse Group AG’s projection of as much as $45
billion. Sales are down from a record $232 billion in 2007.  Dealers have had to offer more generous terms to buyers on
recent offerings. UBS AG and Barclays Plc sold top-ranked
securities maturing in 10 years to yield 160 basis points more
than the benchmark swap rate on June 28, compared with 115 basis
points more than swaps on similar newly issued debt sold in
April, Bloomberg data show. Wider spreads can translate to
higher borrowing costs for landlords.  To contact the reporter on this story:
