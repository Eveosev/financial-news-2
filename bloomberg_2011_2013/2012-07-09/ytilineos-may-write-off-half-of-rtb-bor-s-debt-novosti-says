 RTB Bor, Serbia’s sole copper
producer, says  Greece ’s  Mytilineos Holdings SA (MYTIL)  agreed to write
off half of its $65 million in claims toward the company, which
will repay the rest by 2019,  Vecernje Novosti  reported, citing
chief executive officer.  Mytilineos’s board of directors is expected to approve the
arrangement, under which state-owned RTB Bor will start repaying
the debt in 2014 after it opens a new smelter, the newspaper
report said, quoting Blagoje Spaskovski.  To contact the reporter on this story:
