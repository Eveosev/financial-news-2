Brazil ’s cane harvest and sugar
exports will be hampered by a cold front bringing rains tomorrow
and July 11 to Parana, Sao Paulo, southern Minas Gerais and
southern Mato Grosso do Sul, according to forecaster Somar
Meteorologia.  “Even though the precipitation will be of low intensity
and short duration, the rainy weather conditions will be
unfavorable for the cane harvest and will affect the shipment of
sugar in the ports of Paranagua and Santos,” Somar said today
in an e-mailed report. A new mass of polar air also will advance
across those regions, reducing temperatures without posing any
risk of frost, the Sao Paulo-based analyst said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
