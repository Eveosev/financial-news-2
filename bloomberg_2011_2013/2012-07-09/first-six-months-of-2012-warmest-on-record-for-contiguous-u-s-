The first half of 2012 was the
warmest start to any year going back to 1895, according to the
National Climatic Data Center, and drought now covers more than
half the contiguous 48 U.S. states.  The national temperature in the 48 contiguous states was
52.9 Fahrenheit (11.6 Celsius) from January to June or 4.5
degrees above average, according to  the Climatic Center  in
Asheville,  North Carolina . The 12 months from July 2011 to June
were also the warmest on record.  “Every state across the contiguous U.S. has warmer-than-
average temperatures for the period, except Washington, which
was near normal,” according to the Climatic Center’s monthly
state of the climate report.  Above-average temperatures across the U.S., as well as
increased production, contributed to natural gas prices falling
to a 10-year intraday low of $1.902 per billion British thermal
units on April 19 because less of the fuel was needed to heat
homes this past winter.  The higher temperatures during the summer months helped gas
prices by boosting electricity demand as people turned on air
conditioners, particularly in the large East Coast cities and
 Chicago .  Natural gas for August delivery gained 10.7 cents, or 3.9
percent, to settle at $2.883 per million Btu on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange.  Gas-fired  power plants  produced the same amount of
electricity in April as coal-fired plants, with both generating
32 percent, according to the Energy Department.  Average Temperature  The average temperature in the 48 contiguous states was 56
degrees from July 2011 to June, surpassing the previous record
set from June 2011 to May 2012 by 0.05 degree.  Since March, each 12-month period has set a record for
being the warmest in the 48 states.  The average June temperature in the 48 states was 71.2
degrees, or 2 degrees above the 20th-century average. During
June, 170 all-time high temperatures were set or tied and 3,282
daily records were set or tied in the U.S. as a whole.  In addition to the heat, 56 percent of the 48 contiguous
states are now affected by drought, which is the largest
percentage in the 12 years that the U.S. Drought Monitor in
Lincoln,  Nebraska , has kept track.  The 48 states had the 10th-driest June with a national
average of 2.27 inches (5.8 centimeters) of rain, 0.62 inch
below the average.  Wyoming had its driest June on record, receiving 0.45 inch,
and 11 states from  Nevada  to Kentucky ranked in their top 10
driest, according to the center. Soil moisture in Illinois,
 Indiana ,  Ohio ,  Missouri  and Kentucky ranks in the 10th
percentile among all years since 1895.  The hot, dry conditions have left corn in its worst
condition since 1988, according to the U.S. Agriculture
Department. The U.S. is the largest producer of the crop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
