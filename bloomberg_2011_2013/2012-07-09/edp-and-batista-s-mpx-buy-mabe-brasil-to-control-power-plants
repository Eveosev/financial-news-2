EDP Energias do Brasil SA and  MPX
Energia SA (MPXE3) , the power company owned by billionaire  Eike Batista ,
bought MABE Brasil Ltda to take control of three power plants,
according to an MPX regulatory filing.  The two companies paid the symbolic amount of 1 real (49
U.S. cents) for the purchase, which gives MPX the operation of
the Pecem, Itaqui and Pecem II power plants, according to
yesterday’s filing. The acquisition, which is pending regulatory
approval, gives EDP and MPX each a 50 percent stake in MABE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
