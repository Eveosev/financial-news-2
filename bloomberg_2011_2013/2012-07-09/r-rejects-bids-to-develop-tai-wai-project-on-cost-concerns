MTR Corp. (66) , Hong Kong’s rail operator,
failed to find a partner to develop a property project atop a
station after rejecting all bids filed by developers as too low.  The rail company “would be exposed to a substantial risk
of not recovering the costs of the development” had it accepted
any of the three tender offers received for the Tai Wai station
project, according to  a statement  on its website today. MTR,
which didn’t identify which developers submitted bids, may
tender the project again by the end of the fiscal year, it said.  Property buyers in Hong Kong need to “think carefully”
before purchases because interest rates can’t be lowered any
further, Financial Secretary  John Tsang  said this week. The
number of home transactions in Hong Kong fell 35 percent in June
from a year earlier after a 14 percent drop in May, according to
Land Registry statistics.  MTR fell 0.6 percent to HK$26.95 in Hong Kong trading today
before the announcement. The stock has increased 7.2 percent
this year, compared with the 5.4 percent gain in the city’s
benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  Hong Kong’s residential housing prices have jumped more
than 80 percent since early 2009 on the back of record-low
 mortgage rates  and a lack of new supply.  To contact the reporter on this story:
