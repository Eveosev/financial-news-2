Affinity Gaming LLC disclosed today
that Z Capital Partners LLC, the Chicago-based private equity
firm, acquired a 25 percent stake.  Z Capital bought about 5.05 million shares in the Las
Vegas-based casino and hotel operator, according to a regulatory
filing. The firm focuses on investing in distressed companies
with the goal of taking control, its  website  shows.  Affinity  operates 11 casinos  in Nevada, Missouri and  Iowa ,
including the Terribleâ€™s chain. Formerly known as Herbst Gaming
Inc., the company was renamed last year after emerging from
bankruptcy in 2010 with new ownership.  To contact the reporter on this story:
