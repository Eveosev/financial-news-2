The Vilnius District Court rejected
appeals over repetitive arrests by former Bankas Snoras AB
owners  Vladimir Antonov  and Raimondas Baranauskas, the  Baltic
News Service  reported today, citing prosecutor Darius
Stankevicius.  Stankevicius said no obstacles remain for the extradition
of the two men as the court upheld the European arrest warrants,
the BNS said. Both Antonov and Baranauskas, who were detained in
November and are fighting extradition to Lithuania, were
rearrested in London on July 6 on expanded claims they siphoned
about 1.7 billion litas ($610 million) from the failed
Lithuanian lender. Both men deny any wrongdoing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
