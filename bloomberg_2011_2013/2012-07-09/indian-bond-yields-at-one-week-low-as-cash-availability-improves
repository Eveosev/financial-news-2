India ’s 10-year  bonds  advanced,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in more than a week, on
optimism improved cash levels at banks will spur demand.  Lenders  borrowed  115.3 billion rupees ($2.1 billion) via
the central bank’s daily repurchase auction on July 6, the least
since October, according to  Reserve Bank  of India data.  Gross
domestic product  rose 5.3 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, the slowest pace in nine years, official data
show. Slowing economic growth may prompt the central bank to
ease monetary policy, said R.S Chauhan, chief dealer of
currencies and fixed-income at  State Bank  of Bikaner & Jaipur.  “The surge in liquidity is helping bonds,” said Mumbai-
based Chauhan. “Given the weak economic conditions, bonds will
broadly remain supported.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.15 percent in
Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s
the lowest level since June 28.  The  finance ministry  will repay 140 billion rupees of debt
on July 18, according to budget documents, further boosting cash
in the financial system.  The central bank kept the repo  rate  unchanged at 8 percent
at a policy review on June 18, after cutting it by 50 basis
points in April. The next policy review is on July 31.  One-year  interest-rate swaps , or derivative contracts used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points to 7.76 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
