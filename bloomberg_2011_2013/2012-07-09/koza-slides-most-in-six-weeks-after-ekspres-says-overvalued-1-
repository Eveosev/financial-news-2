Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL) , a Turkish
gold mining company, fell the most in more than six weeks after
Ekspres Invest said the company is overvalued and its profit is
expected to fall.  The shares declined 4.3 percent to 35.50 liras at the close
in Istanbul, the biggest retreat since May 24. The slide pared
the stock’s surge this year to 41 percent, the highest on record
since at least December, compared with a 22 percent jump for the
 ISE National 100 Index (XU100) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The company is much too expensive considering the reserve
amounts in hand,” Alper Akalin and Sinan Goksen, analysts at
the brokerage, said in an e-mailed report today, referring to
Koza’s gold reserves.  Koza’s profit will probably fall as the grade, or quality,
of the company’s gold deteriorates and its current mines
deplete, increasing reliance on the more costly underground
operations, the analysts said.  “We expect a visible deterioration in profitability,”
they said. The shares were given a 12-month price estimate of
37.90 liras, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
