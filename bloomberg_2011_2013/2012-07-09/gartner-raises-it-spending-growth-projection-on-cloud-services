Global spending on  information
technology  may grow at a 3 percent pace, faster than previously
forecast, to $3.6 trillion this year as expenditures for public
cloud services increase,  Gartner Inc. (IT)  said.  The estimate compares with Gartner’s projection last
quarter of 2.5 percent growth, the  Stamford , Connecticut-based
researcher said in a report today. Spending on public cloud
services may rise to $109 billion from $91 billion last year,
Gartner said.  Telecommunication services will continue to be the largest
IT market, Gartner said. It will grow 1.4 percent to $1.7
trillion this year as businesses, especially those in emerging
economies, spend more on Internet connections and increase use
of connected devices including media tablets, gaming, and other
consumer electronics.  IT services spending may increase 2.3 percent to $864
billion this year, buoyed by demand for consulting services
because of the “complexity of environments” for businesses and
rising demand for analytics, Gartner said.  Worldwide IT spending growth will slow from 7.9 percent
last year as the euro zone crisis, a weaker U.S. recovery and a
slowdown in  China  curb economic growth, the researcher said.  “There has been little change in either business
confidence or consumer sentiment in the past quarter, so the
short-term outlook is for continued caution in IT spending,”
 Richard Gordon , vice president for research at Gartner, said in
a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
