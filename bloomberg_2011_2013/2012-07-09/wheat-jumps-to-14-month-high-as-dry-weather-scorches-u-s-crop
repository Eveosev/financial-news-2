Wheat futures rose to a 14-month high
as hot, dry weather in the past two weeks curbed prospects for
the spring crop in the northern portion of the U.S. Great
Plains.  No rain has fallen in 14 days in areas of  North Dakota , the
biggest U.S. wheat producer, National Weather Service data show.
About 71 percent of the  spring crop  was rated good or excellent
as of July 1, down from 77 percent a week earlier, U.S.
Department of Agriculture data show. This afternoon, the
government will release a weekly report on plant conditions.  “They need moisture soon” in the northern Plains, Jamey Kohake, a broker at Paragon Investments in  Silver Lake ,  Kansas ,
said in a telephone interview. “They’ve been taking a beating
the last couple of weeks.”  Wheat futures for September delivery gained 3.4 percent to
$8.335 a bushel at 10:07 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Earlier, the price reached $8.4575, the highest for a most-
active contract since April 27, 2011.  From the end of May to July 6, wheat surged 25 percent
after hot, dry weather eroded yields in the southern Plains.  Corn futures in  Chicago  surged by the exchange limit of 40
cents a bushel, signaling more demand for wheat to make
livestock feed.  Wheat is the fourth-largest U.S. crop, valued at $14.4
billion in 2011, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
