increased the number of corporate customers this year to 5,000,
Eric Musau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based Standard
Investment Bank Ltd. said in a phone interview today.  Mumias Sugar Co. (MSUG)  , Kenya’s biggest producer of the
sweetener, jumped to the highest in more than eight months,

a “good dividend”, Faith Atiti, an analyst at Nairobi-based
Sterling Investment Bank Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
