The Standard & Poor’s GSCI  gauge  of
24 commodities rose 0.7 percent to 609.08 at 5:34 p.m. Singapore
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials gained
0.8 percent to 1509.40.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rebounded in  New York  after the biggest drop in two
weeks as a labor strike threatened to halt production in  Norway ,
Western Europe’s biggest exporter.  West Texas Intermediate oil for August delivery climbed as
much as 60 cents to $85.05 a barrel in electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $84.61 at 9:20 a.m.
London time. The contract slid $2.77 on July 6 to close at
$84.45, the lowest settlement since July 2. Prices are down 14
percent this year.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in New York rebounded after declining
the most in four weeks.  OIL PRODUCTS  The crack spread for gasoil, or diesel, rose 58 cents to
$17.88 a barrel over Dubai crude as of 10 a.m. Singapore time,
according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd. , a broker.  Gasoil  swaps for August declined 70 cents to $113.55 a
barrel, PVM data showed. Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the
regrade, fell 15 cents to 85 cents.  High-sulfur  fuel oil ’s discount  to Dubai crude narrowed 18
cents to $1.54 a barrel, according to PVM. The crack narrowed
from one-month low, signaling smaller refining losses to produce
the residue.  Fuel oil swaps for August fell $7, or 1.16 percent, to
$597.75 a metric ton, PVM said. The premium of 180-centistoke
fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade, or the viscosity spread , was
unchanged after it rose to $10.75, showing bunker, or marine
fuel, moved in tandem with higher-quality supplies used in power
stations.  Naphtha swaps for August fell $7.75, or 1 percent, to
$809.75 a ton, according to PVM.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
declined $13.63 to $64.11 a ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This crack spread , a measure of processing profit,
fell from the widest since May 23.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold is set to decline for a fourth day in  London  as a
stronger dollar curbs demand for the metal as an alternative
investment.  Bullion for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,580.78 an ounce by 9:30 a.m. in London. A fourth consecutive
decline would be the longest losing streak since May 16. August-
delivery futures were 0.1 percent higher at $1,580.90 on the
Comex in New York.  BASE METALS  Copper was seen falling for a fourth day in London as
further evidence that economies are slowing fed concern about
the outlook for demand.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS, SOFT COMMODITIES  Soybeans in  Chicago  and Dalian advanced to the highest
levels since July 2008, the year of the global food crisis,
after hot Midwest weather threatened to curb yields amid rising
demand in  China . Corn and wheat climbed.  Soybeans for November delivery rose as much as 2.6 percent
to $15.4475 a bushel and traded at $15.425 at 2:10 p.m.
Singapore time. The May 2013 contract in Dalian jumped as much
as 4.1 percent to 4,869  yuan  ($764) a metric ton.  Corn for December delivery climbed as much as 3.4 percent
to $7.1625 a bushel in Chicago, the highest price for the most-
active contract since Sept. 15, before trading at $7.13. Prices
have surged 41 percent since June 15.  Wheat for September delivery gained as much as 2.4 percent
to $8.2525 a bushel and was last at $8.245.  Rubber slumped by the most in more than two weeks after a
U.S. jobs report deepened concern the world’s largest economy is
slowing, sapping demand for the commodity used in tires.  December-delivery rubber lost as much as 3.8 percent, the
biggest drop for the most-active contract since June 22, to
245.5 yen a kilogram ($3,082 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange, before settling at 249.1 yen. Futures have
declined 5.4 percent this year.  Palm oil  advanced on concern that El Nino weather
conditions, which can parch  Asia , may curb production later this
year in Indonesia and  Malaysia , the world’s biggest growers.  The September-delivery contract gained as much as 1.3
percent to 3,172 ringgit ($995) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and was at 3,167 ringgit at 4:21 p.m. in
 Kuala Lumpur . Futures climbed 3.6 percent last week as a heat
wave in the U.S. drove soybean prices higher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
