Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. (4502) ,  Japan â€™s
largest drugmaker, raised $3 billion of debt in its first
dollar-denominated bond sale as borrowing costs in the U.S.
touched a record low.  The company sold $1.5 billion of 1.031 percent, three-year
notes yielding 68 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $1.5 billion of 1.625 percent, five-year notes
priced to yield 100 basis points more than benchmarks, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Japanese drugmaker may use
the proceeds to pay back debt from its 9.6 billion-euro ($12.4
billion) purchase of its competitor Nycomed.  Takeda sold bonds after the cost of borrowing for
investment-grade companies in the U.S. fell to a record low 3.26
percent on July 6, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
U.S. Corporate Master Index data going back to 1986.  The sale of the securities was managed by Nomura Holdings
Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
