The Midwest may stay hot and dry from
this weekend to the middle of the month while heat returns to
the East Coast next week.  Temperatures may range 3 to 8 Fahrenheit (2.7 to 4.4
Celsius) degrees above normal from  Minnesota  to Missouri, while
receiving below-average rain from July 14 to 23, according to
Joel Widenor, co-founder of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  While temperatures in the Mid-Atlantic and U.S. Northeast
may be 3 degrees above normal during the same time period, the
U.S. South may have above-average rain at the same time, said
Widenor from Bethesda,  Maryland .  Above-normal temperatures in the large cities along the
East Coast can cause more people to use air conditioners to cool
down, driving up electricity use and spot energy prices. The
increase demand also affects natural gas markets because the
fuel is used by about 36 percent of U.S. power plants.  In addition, dry conditions in the Midwest can hurt crop
yields and while keeping average temperatures higher than
normal.  For July 10, the normal average temperature in  New York
City  is 77, according to MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg,
Maryland. Itâ€™s 73 in  Boston ; 80 in Washington; 80 in Atlanta; 75
in Chicago; 84 in Houston; 65 in Seattle and 74 in Burbank,
California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
