Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)  led Czech shares
down from their highest in two months as the Prague Stock
Exchange reopened after two public holidays.  The Austrian bank tumbled 5.9 percent, the most in five
months, to 376.50 koruna by 9:41 a.m. in Prague. The  PX (PX)  index,
in which Erste has a 20 percent weighting, dropped 1.6 percent.  European and emerging-market shares fell after Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao said the nation’s economy faces “relatively
large” downward pressure and U.S. jobs data missed estimates.
The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  slid 1.1 percent on July 5 and July 6
when the Czech equity market was closed. Erste tumbled 7.1
percent in Vienna, its home market, in the period.  “The  Prague  bourse has opened down, catching up with moves
on regional indexes on Thursday and Friday,” Martin Krajhanzl,
an analyst at Ceska Sporitelna AS in Prague, wrote in an e-mail
to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
