Reseau de Transport d’Electricite, a
unit of French power generator  Electricite de France SA , signed
a 1.5 billion-euro ($1.8 billion) credit line to fund its
business and refinance, lenders said in a statement.  The five-year revolving credit will replace the company’s 1
billion-euro seven-year credit line signed in May 2006 and a 500
million-euro 364-day facility, according to the statement.  The deal, led by Credit Agricole SA and Natixis, was
increased from 1.25 billion-euro originally targeted after
lenders offered more than was sought, lenders said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
