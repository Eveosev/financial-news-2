The euro declined to within 0.3
percent of its lowest level in two years, before reports
forecast to show industrial production shrank in  France  and
 Italy  as  Europe ’s debt crisis undermines growth.  The 17-nation currency was 0.3 percent from a one-month low
against the yen after European Union Economic and Monetary
Affairs Commissioner  Olli Rehn  said  Spain  will have to take
additional measures soon to meet budget targets. The dollar
strengthened versus most of its 16 major peers as Asian stocks
declined. The Australian and  New Zealand  currencies dropped
after data showed growth in exports and imports slowed in China.  “The euro is going to stay quite weak, particularly
against the  U.S. dollar  and the yen,” said  Joseph Capurso , a
strategist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the
nation’s biggest lender. “The  euro zone  is still in recession
and it’s probably getting even deeper.”  The euro lost 0.2 percent to $1.2287 as of 6:30 a.m. in
 London  after sliding to as low as $1.2251 yesterday, the weakest
since July 2010. The shared currency fell 0.3 percent to 97.69
yen from 97.95 yesterday, when it touched 97.43, the lowest
since June 5.  The dollar slid 0.1 percent to 79.50 yen. The so-called
Aussie dropped 0.3 percent to $1.0173, while the New Zealand
currency weakened 0.3 percent to 79.39 U.S. cents.  Production Reports  Industrial  production  in France probably dropped 1 percent
in May from the previous month, when it climbed 1.5 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey
before Paris-based national statistics office Insee releases the
report today.  A separate poll showed  output  in Italy may have fallen 0.6
percent in the same period after weakening 1.9 percent in April.
The figures are also due today. Production in the  euro area 
probably stalled in May after two straight months of decline,
economists in another forecast before the data is reported on
July 12.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  signaled the
bank may consider another interest-rate cut if the economic
outlook warrants it, when he addressed lawmakers in Brussels
yesterday. The ECB lowered the main refinancing rate to a record
0.75 percent and cut the deposit rate to zero on July 5.  The possibility of additional reductions “is going to keep
downward pressure on euro,” CBA’s Capurso said. “There’s a
good chance over the next few months euro could get down to the
lows we saw around $1.18.” The currency touched a then four-
year low of $1.1877 in June 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Spanish Yields  Rehn said it’s “essential” that Spain meet its fiscal
targets, speaking to reporters at a briefing after a meeting of
euro-area finance ministers in Brussels, which included
discussions on measures for the nation’s lenders adopted by
heads of government at a summit last month.  Ten-year yields  in Spain, which requested as much as 100
billion euros ($123 billion) of European aid last month for its
banks, climbed 11 basis points to 7.06 percent yesterday.  Thirty billion euros will be lent by the end of July with
the goal of eventually using the euro-area bailout fund to
recapitalize banks directly instead of saddling the Spanish
government with the debts, Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  said today after the finance ministers’ meeting.  Euro Shorts  The difference in the number of wagers on a decline in the
euro compared with those on a gain, known as  net shorts , was
146,177 in the five days ended July 3, according to figures from
the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Traders have held net short positions in the shared currency
since the period through August 30, the data show.  The euro has weakened 2.3 percent in the past month, the
worst performance alongside the Swiss franc among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes. New Zealand’s dollar was the biggest gainer,
rising 3.2 percent in the same period. The Aussie advanced 2.6
percent.  The South Pacific currencies weakened after a report from
the customs bureau showed  China ’s  overseas shipments  rose 11.3
percent in June from a year earlier, after increasing 15.3
percent the prior month. Imports grew by 6.3 percent, compared
with a 12.7 percent gain in May.  China is  Australia ’s biggest trading partner and New
Zealand’s second-largest export destination.  The dollar strengthened versus most of its peers as Asian
stock declines boosted demand for the relative safety of the
U.S. currency. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares slid 0.3
percent.  Dollar Index  The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S.
trading partners, gained 0.1 percent to 83.245. The gauge may
climb toward 84.93 should it breach resistance at 83.55,  Niall O’Connor , a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan Chase &
Co., wrote in a note yesterday. Resistance is an area on a chart
where orders to sell may be clustered.  The 84.93 level is the 76.4 percent Fibonacci retracement
of the index’s decline from a high of 88.71 reached in June 2010
to a low of 72.70 in May 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The level was last seen in July 2010, the data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
