AK Steel  Holding Corp., a producer of
the alloy that  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded last month, will cut
its estimated 2013 pension expense by one-third, or $100
million, after passage of a transportation bill extension
lowered some required contributions.  AK Steel will pay $200 million into its pension fund in
2013 after the Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2012 was
signed into law on July 6, the  West Chester , Ohio-based company
said today in a filing with the Securities & Exchange
Commission. The bill stabilizes the minimum annual contributions
to fund defined-benefit pension plans, while raising premiums
paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., AK said.  Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded AK Steel’s
credit rating to B+, or four levels below investment grade, on
June 29. “Weak” results at AK won’t recover in the next
several quarters because of the steelmaker’s high fixed costs
and lower prices than expected for the metal, the ratings
company said.  AK Steel was unchanged at $6.14 at 10:14 a.m. in  New York .
The company raised its price for its flat steel products by $40
a ton on July 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
