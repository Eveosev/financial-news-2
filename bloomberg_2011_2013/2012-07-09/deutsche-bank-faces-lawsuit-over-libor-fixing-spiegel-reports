B. Metzler Seel. Sohn & Co. KGaA is
seeking damages from Deutsche Bank AG and other lenders for
allegedly putting pressure on Libor in 2007 and 2008 to reduce
their refinancing costs,  Der Spiegel  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  A Metzler investment company filed the lawsuit in a  New
York  court, according to the German magazine. Metzler couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment.  Armin Niedermeier, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank, declined
to comment on the report. He referred Bloomberg News to the
bank’s March statement that it’s cooperating with regulators in
an investigation of suspected manipulation of interbank lending
rates and that litigations against Deutsche Bank in this matter
are “in their early stages.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
