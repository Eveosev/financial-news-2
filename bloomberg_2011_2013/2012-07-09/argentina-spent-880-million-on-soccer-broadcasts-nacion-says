Argentina â€™s government spent 4
billion pesos ($880 million) over the past three years on local
soccer broadcasts, newspaper La Nacion  reported , citing
government data and private estimates.  The government paid local soccer association AFA 2.27
billion pesos for exclusive rights to broadcast six
championships since August 2009, while the rest was spent on
government advertising during games and broadcast and production
costs, the Buenos Aires-based newspaper reported. Private
advertising was only accepted in the first tournament, La Nacion
reported, citing an investigation by Search.  Top division soccer matches are broadcast free of charge.  To contact the reporter on this story:
