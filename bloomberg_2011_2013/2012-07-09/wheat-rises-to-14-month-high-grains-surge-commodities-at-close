24 commodities added 1.8 percent to 615.94 at 3:54 p.m.  New York 
time. The UBS Bloomberg CMCI  index  of 26 raw materials added 1.7
percent to 1,522.9225.  GRAINS  Wheat futures rose to a 14-month high as hot, dry weather
in the past two weeks curbed prospects for the spring crop in
the northern portion of the U.S. Great Plains.  No rain has fallen in 14 days in areas of  North Dakota , the
biggest U.S. wheat producer, National Weather Service data show.
About 71 percent of the spring crop was in good or excellent
condition as of July 1, down from 77 percent a week earlier,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  Wheat futures for September delivery gained 2.7 percent to

active contract since April 27, 2011.  Corn futures for December delivery, after the harvest,

$15.4775 a bushel after reaching $15.7125, the highest level

mounted after dry weather threatened crops in  India  and rain
delayed the harvest in  Brazil , the world’s top producer. Cocoa,
coffee, cotton and orange juice also gained.  Raw sugar for October delivery climbed 2 percent to settle
at 22.7 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The price

percent to $1.29 a pound. The price rose for the fourth straight
session, the longest rally since mid-April.  CRUDE OIL  Oil rose for the first time in three days as a labor strike
threatened to halt all offshore oil and gas production in
 Norway , Western  Europe ’s biggest exporter.  Oil for August delivery rose $1.54, or 1.8 percent, to
settle at $85.99 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices are down 13 percent this year.  Brent crude  for August settlement gained $2.13, or 2.2
percent, to $100.32 a barrel on ICE.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline rose on speculation that a struggling U.S. jobs
market, Europe’s debt crisis and a slowdown in China will prompt
more fiscal easing to stimulate growth.  August-delivery gasoline advanced 4.34 cents, or 1.6
percent, to settle at $2.7594 a gallon on the Nymex, the third
gain in four days.  Heating oil for August delivery rose 3.91 cents, or 1.4
percent, to settle at $2.749 a gallon on the exchange.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas futures in New York rose the most in three
weeks as forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather in the
northern half of the U.S. signaled increased demand from  power
plants  to run air conditioners.  Natural gas for August delivery gained 10.7 cents, or 3.9
percent, to settle at $2.883 per million British thermal units
on the Nymex.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold futures rose for the first time in three sessions on
signs of increasing demand from China.  In May, imports by China from  Hong Kong  jumped sixfold to
75,635.7 kilograms (75.6 metric tons) from a year earlier, Hong
Kong government data showed. The nation “remains the most
important player on the global gold market,” Commerzbank AG

months climbed 0.4 percent to $7,560 a ton ($3.43 a pound).  Nickel, aluminum, lead, zinc and tin also gained in London.  LIVESTOCK  Hog futures posted their biggest gain in more than a week
on speculation that lower temperatures in the U.S. Midwest are
easing a heat wave that slowed pork demand for outdoor grilling.
Cattle prices dropped.  Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.7 percent to
settle at 93.95 cents a pound on Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
the biggest gain since June 29. Prices are up 11 percent this
year.  Cattle futures for August delivery fell 0.1 percent to
