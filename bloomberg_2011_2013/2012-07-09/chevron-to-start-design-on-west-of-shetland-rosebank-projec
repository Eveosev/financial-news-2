Chevron Corp. (CVX) , the second-largest
U.S. oil company, said it will start design work to develop the
Rosebank offshore oil and gas discovery west of the Shetland
Islands in the U.K.  Rosebank, discovered in 2004, has potential recoverable
resources of 240 million barrels of oil, Chevron said in a
statement today. The field will be developed using a floating
production, storage and offloading vessel.  “The efforts by the U.K. government to stimulate
development in this important region have enabled the
progression of this project,” said Brenda Dulaney, managing
director, Chevron upstream Europe. “Rosebank is an important
project for Chevron in Europe.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
