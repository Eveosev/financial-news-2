The U.K. Serious Fraud Office
reopened a criminal investigation into the collapse of hedge
fund Weavering Capital (UK) Ltd.  The SFO probe relates to interest rate swaps between the
fund and a company in the British Virgin Islands which “had the
effect of inflating the net asset value of the fund,” the
agency said in statement on its website.  Weavering Capital, which once had about $640 million under
management, collapsed in March 2009 after discovering the
counterparty for its biggest trading position was controlled by
the fund’s manager. The SFO last year dropped its initial
criminal probe into the fund’s founder, Magnus Peterson, because
it didn’t think it could win a conviction.  The SFO decision “is welcomed by Weavering’s investors,”
Barnaby Stueck, a lawyer for Duff and Phelps Corp., the fund’s
liquidators, said in a telephone interview in  London  today.
“They and the professional advisers involved in the case will
provide every assistance to the SFO.”  Monty Raphael, Peterson’s attorney, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment. The Financial Times
reported on the SFO investigation yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
