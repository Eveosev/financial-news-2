Nigerian gunmen attacked and killed
two lawmakers who were attending a mass burial ceremony in
Plateau State for victims of an earlier attack by Muslim
herdsmen, military officials said.  Gyang Dalyop, a member of the country’s Senate, and state
lawmaker Gyang James Fulani were ambushed yesterday, said Salisu
Mustapha, the spokesman for the military joint  task force  in the
area. The burial was held between Riyom and Barikin Ladi, the
sites of the earlier killings.  “A curfew has been imposed in the troubled areas by the
state government,” Mustapha said in a telephone interview
yesterday. At least 37 people were killed in clashes on July 7
when gunmen attacked Kankuru villages near Jos in Plateau State,
he said in a statement handed to reporters.  For more than a decade, the state has been the scene of
ethnic and religious rivalries over land and power between the
mainly Christian indigenous population and Muslim migrants.  Islamist sect Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for
several suicide bomb attacks on churches in Plateau State this
year, prompting a Christian backlash against Muslims. Nigeria’s
population of more than 164 million is split almost equally
between Christians in the south and Muslims in the north.  To contact the reporters on this story:
