Yemen raised the premium for its
Masila blend crude for delivery in September to 52 cents a
barrel more than Dated Brent from 23 cents for August, the
Arabian Peninsula state’s oil marketing committee said.  China International United Petroleum & Chemical Co., the
trader known as Unipec, was awarded 2.6 million barrels of the
blend for September via a tender, Yemen said today in an e-
mailed statement.  Marib Light crude remained at parity to Dated Brent and
Yemen didn’t announce the sale of any quantities of the grade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
