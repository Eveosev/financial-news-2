Unipetrol AS (UNIP)  jumped the most in more
than four months after Czech Industry and Trade Minister Martin
Kuba said in a Lidove Noviny interview the government may buy a
stake in the oil refinerâ€™s Ceska Rafinerska unit.  The stock climbed 2.4 percent, the steepest increase since
March 1, to 174.50 koruna, making it the second-best performer
today in the  PX (PX)  equity index, which dropped 1.9 percent. More
than 218,000 Unipetrol shares have changed hands so far today,
more than four times the daily average in the past three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
