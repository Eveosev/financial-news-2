European Central Bank President  Mario
Draghi  reiterated that the euro area’s bailout fund won’t be
able to take a direct stake in lenders until a single banking
supervisory system is established, which may not happen until
next year.  Asked by European parliamentarians about the European
Stability Mechanism directly recapitalizing banks, Draghi said
it “certainly can be done only when the supervision is in
place.” He added at the hearing that “it might take some
time” and “we certainly want to see something close by the end
of this year.”  The 500 billion-euro ($616 billion) ESM will start once
Germany and  Italy  give final approval. It will work with paid-in
capital, making it more flexible than the 440 billion-euro
European Financial Stability Facility that it replaces. Euro-
region leaders pledged on June 29 to give the ESM the power to
make direct cash injections into banks once the  euro zone  sets
up a single banking supervisor, possibly as early as 2013.  The statement from their summit said that “when an
effective single supervisory mechanism is established, involving
the ECB, for banks in the euro area the ESM could, following a
regular decision, have the possibility to recapitalize banks
directly.”  This is to be considered “as a matter of urgency by the
end of 2012,” according to the statement.  Draghi said today it wouldn’t be a problem if the ESM isn’t
able to do that this year because markets will understand that
any recapitalizations in the meantime will only temporarily
impose a cost on governments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
