Princeton University  raised a record
$1.88 billion in its fundraising campaign, exceeding its goal.  More than 65,000 donors, including alumni, corporations,
foundations and parents, made 271,559 separate gifts since the
effort was introduced in November 2007, according to a  statement 
on Princeton’s website today.  “The success of this collective effort to strengthen the
university to better serve the nation and the world is a tribute
to the dedication, enthusiasm and generosity of our alumni,
parents and friends,” Shirley M. Tilghman, Princeton’s
president, said in the statement.  More than 77 percent of all undergraduate alumni donated to
the school, one of eight members of the Ivy League in the
northeastern U.S. Alumni include First Lady  Michelle Obama  and
Supreme Court Justices Samuel Alito Jr.,  Sonia Sotomayor  and
Elena Kagan.  Princeton’s endowment was valued at $17.1 billion as of
June 30, 2011. It is the fourth largest in higher education,
behind Harvard University and Yale University, both Ivy League
members; and the University of Texas system, according to  data
collected  by the National Association of College and University
Business Officers and Commonfund Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
