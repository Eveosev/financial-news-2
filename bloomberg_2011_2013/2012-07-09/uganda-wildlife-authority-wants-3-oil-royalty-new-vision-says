The Uganda Wildlife Authority is
demanding a 3 percent loyalty on oil revenue because it owns
more than 70 percent of oilfield land, New Vision reported,
citing Stephen Masaba, an official at the organization.  The funding will enable the authority to counter the
negative effects of oil on the ecosystem in the Albertine
region, the Kampala-based newspaper reported, citing Charles
Tumwesigye, another official at the authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
