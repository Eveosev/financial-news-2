A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate
debt risk rose as euro-area finance ministers meet to finalize
details of the rescue plan for banks agreed upon last month by
the leaders of the currency bloc.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
0.9 basis point to a mid-price of 113.6 basis points at 8:20
a.m. in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  The measure increased for the third consecutive day as
investor concern grows that  Europe ’s financial and economic
crisis will leak onto U.S. balance sheets and crimp profits,
undermining borrowers’ ability to repay debt. Euro-area leaders
decided June 29 to relax the means of recapitalizing banks by
easing direct access to bailout funds, a week before the
 European Central Bank  cut its main refinancing rate to a record
low 0.75 percent.  The swaps gauge typically climbs as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. Credit swaps pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
