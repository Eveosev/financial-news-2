Merger and acquisition activity in
the global $3.8 trillion  chemical industry  will remain
“robust” this year as cash-rich companies jostle with private
equity for assets, according to research by Valence Group.  With  DuPont Co. (DD)  and  Cytec Industries Inc. (CYT)  among the
companies poised to sell businesses, the average deal size for
2012 may match the levels of the past two years, said Valence,
which has advised on more than 200 chemicals and materials
deals.  “With little discernible volume difference from the first
quarter to the second quarter and with deal volume tracking 2010
levels, as well as continued acquisition appetite in the market
and profitability remaining strong, the short term chemicals M&A
market is expected to remain robust,” said Valence, which
produces indices to track valuations and other trends.  There are no indications that the valuation mutliples being
placed on assets are slipping, Valence said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
